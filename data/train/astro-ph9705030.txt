    "the galaxy appears to be prolate with an axis ratio of 3:1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on determination of its orbit , the galaxy must have undergone many orbital crossing of the galaxy , but although distorted has not been disrupted ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". there are four globular clusters associated with the sagitarius dwarf , of which m  54 may constitute the nucleus ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy appears to be more massive than the majority of galactic dwarf ellipticals and its luminosity is @xmath82@xmath910@xmath10 l@xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "zijlstra & walsh ( 1996 ) during the course of a survey of the dynamics of planetary nebulae ( pn ) toward the galactic bulge discovered that two previously catalogued ( galactic ) pn in the direction towards the sagittarius dwarf had radial velocities in agreement with that of the tidal tail of the sagittarius galaxy .",
    "figure 1 in zijlstra & walsh ( 1996 ) shows the position of these two pn ( he  2 - 436 , ( @xcite ) and wray  16 - 423 ( @xcite ) ) in relation to the galaxy and its globular clusters .",
    "a third pn ( prmg-1 ) also lies in the direction towards this galaxy ( @xmath12 ) , and has been considered as a halo planetary nebula on the basis of its low abundances ( @xcite ) .",
    "prmg-1 clearly does not belong to the galactic bulge population so could be a possible member of the sagittarius dwarf ; lacking a radial velocity measurement however , its membership is unproven .    in view of the importance of these pn for studying the stellar population and star formation history of the closest dwarf galaxy to our galaxy , narrow and broad slit spectrophotometry and emission line imagery",
    "were obtained of both he  2 - 436 and wray  16 - 423 in order to study their chemical abundances and their size and structure .",
    "in addition , spectroscopy of the only other pn known in a dwarf elliptical satellite galaxy of the milky way , that in fornax ( @xcite ) , was also obtained .",
    "section 2 presents the observations and reductions and section 3 the analysis .",
    "section 4 discusses the abundance pattern revealed by these three nebulae in the context of the chemical evolution of the local dwarf galaxies .",
    "long slit observations of both sagittarius dwarf galaxy pn were obtained with the eso ntt and nasmyth imager / spectrograph emmi using the red imaging and low dispersion mode ( rild ) mode , with grism # 3 and a slit width of 1.5@xmath2 .",
    "the rild mode allows imaging , long - slit grism spectroscopy , slitless and multi - object spectroscopy over the wavelength range 4000 - 10000 .",

    "broad slit observations of ltt  3864 ( @xcite ) accompanied all the pn observations for flux calibration . for the low dispersion spectra , the very high quantum efficiency in the blue for this coated ccd meant that there was significant contamination of the spectra from second order light at wavelengths above 6300 , despite using a gg345 blocking filter . as a result",

    "all the 2-d spectra were reduced in the usual way , using the spectroscopic packages in iraf .",
    "the bias was subtracted , the pixel - to - pixel variations were rectified by division by a mean sky flat field exposure and the data were rebinned into channels of constant wavelength width by fitting third order polynomials to the comparison lamp spectra .",
    "the atmospheric extinction was corrected and an absolute flux calibration was applied from the observation of the spectrophotometric standard .",
    "spectra were extracted over the total extent of the nebulae along the slit ( large for the ntt observations on account of the poor focus ) and the mean sky from along the slit was utilized for sky subtraction .",

    "all the spectra were analysed by interactively fitting gaussians to the emission lines .",
    "errors on the line fits were computed taking into account the photon noise on the data , the read - out noise and the underlying continuum and sky , and errors on the lines fluxes were propagated . within the errors the eso 1.5 m low and intermediate dispersion data were consistent for each pn .",
    "however the reddening for he  2 - 436 , determined from the ratios of the observed balmer lines to the case b values , for the ntt grism data was larger than the value determined from the eso 1.5 m data .",
    "also no consistent fit to a single value of c was determined from the h@xmath1/h@xmath19 , h@xmath19/h@xmath20 and h@xmath19/h@xmath21 ratios for the ntt observations of wray  16 - 423 .",
    "the ntt data suffered from poor focus which may have affected the spectral transmission , even though the observations were taken at modest zenith distances ( 29@xmath22 for the standard , 26@xmath22 for he  2 - 436 and 16@xmath22 for wray  16 - 423 ) .",
    "the he  2 - 436 ntt spectrum indicated a consistent , but high , value of the reddening from ratios of balmer lines and was taken at similar airmass to the spectrophotometric standard , whilst the airmass of the wray  16 - 423 observation differed .",
    "the different values of reddening remain puzzling but the dereddened spectra from the eso 1.5 m and ntt data for he  2 - 423 were very similar tending to indicate that there was a systematic ( colour ) effect for the ntt spectra .",
    "@xcite have discussed in detail the problems encountered in spectrophtometry of faint emission line objects such as pn . in our case the lack of image analysis most probably resulted in the image being centred in the slit only for a narrow range of wavelengths and thus the effects of differential atmospheric refraction were exaggerated . in particular uncorrected coma ( which is wavelength dependent ) could account for the effects .",
    "it was decided to adopt the eso 1.5 m reddening values and use the relative line fluxes in the blue . where fainter lines were detected in the ntt spectra , or better detections of fainter lines , these values were used , taking the ratio to the nearest strong line ; errors were propagated accordingly . in the red ( @xmath17@xmath236300 )",
    "the second order contamination affected the eso 1.5 m fluxes , so the ntt fluxes were used in this region scaled to the dereddened h@xmath1 flux .",
    "thus the composite spectrum was constructed in dereddened space and then reddened .",
    "the galactic reddening law ( @xcite ) was used throughout .",
    "tables 4 and 5 list the resulting observed and dereddened nebular spectra of he  2 - 436 and wray  16 - 423 respectively .",
    "the errors are the propagated 1@xmath24 errors from the line fits ; the sometimes differing error values for lines of similar strength result from the source of the line strengths ( eso 1.5 m grating low dispersion ( 3600 - 6400 ) , eso 1.5 m intermediate dispersion for the 3500 - 4500  region and ntt spectrum ( 4100 - 8000 ) ) . given that the final spectra in tables 4 and 5 are composites of several individual spectra , there may be small systematic errors which increase slightly the errors above those tabulated .",
    "the errors on the reddening have not been propagated to the dereddened relative line intensities in tables 4 and 5 .",
    "table 6 lists the derived parameters from the spectra .",
    "noteworthy is the differing value of c for the two nebulae .",
    "he  2 - 436 has a much higher extinction ( by 0.28 in e@xmath0 ) than wray  16 - 423 .",
    "the extinction to wray  16 - 423 is the same as that for the stellar component of the sagittarius dwarf ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , further corroborating evidence that it is indeed a bona fide member of this galaxy .",
    "the higher extinction to he  2 - 423 is either evidence for patchy extinction along the two line of sight through the galaxy to this pn or suggests that there is local extinction in he  2 - 423 .",
    "given that he  2 - 423 is a compact , dense nebula with strong ir emission ( it corresponds to the iras point source 19288 - 3419 with well detected 12 and 25@xmath13 m fluxes ) , then there is probably a large component of local extinction present .",
    "the absolute observed h@xmath19 flux for wray  16 - 423 was determined from the wide slit observation . for he  2 - 436",
    "no reliable wide slit observation was obtained and the result from @xcite was used .",
    "the h  i ( and for wray  16 - 423 the he  ii ) black body zanstra temperatures were determined from the long exposure ( narrow slit ) spectra after scaling the total spectrum ( line + continuum ) by the ratio of the absolute h@xmath19 flux to the observed h@xmath19 flux , reddening correcting the spectra and subtracting the h and he nebula continuum ( bound - free , free - free and 2-photon ) , using the dipso analysis package ( @xcite ) .",

    "the abundance values listed for fornax in table 8 must be considered more uncertain in view of the lack of a direct measurement of the electron density in this nebula .",
    "the striking aspect is that the o , ne and ar abundances are identical within the errors between the fornax pn and the sagittarius pn .",
    "this level of similarity strongly suggests that all three pn were formed within a common evolutionary scenario and , since they arise in similar mass stellar systems , at similar evolutionary times . the largest discrepancy between these three pn is for n , where the n abundance of he  2 - 436 is very low .",
    "however the ionization correction factor is large for this element and the diagnostic diagram shows a range of physical conditions ; a lower electron temperature and or a higher electron density in the low ionization zone would increase the n abundance .",

    "it can be concluded that the sagittarius pn progenitors are representative of the higher metallicity tail of the sagittarius population .",
    "choosing as compromise a mean [ fe / h ] of -0.8 , leads to a relative oxygen abundance of [ o / fe ] = + 0.2 for sagittarius .",
    "it is natural to compare the abundances of the sagittarius and fornax pn with those of the ` halo ' pn .",
    "the halo pn are not a well defined group , being selected on the basis of either position away from the galactic plane , high velocities and or low abundances .",
    "their abundances vary over a rather wide range so it is not appropriate to form a mean abundance set ( see howard et al ( 1997 ) for an abundance analysis of 9 halo pn ) .",

    "the possible candidate pn in sagittarius , prmg-1 ( pn g 006.0 @xmath341.9 ) , is included in table 8 although the n and s abundances are limits only ; the abundances are also similar to the sagittarius and fornax pn .",
    "barker & cudworth ( 1984 ) have suggested that s and ar , which should not be affected by the agb nuclear processing , should be representative of the heavy element abundance of the parent material .",
    "the similarity in abundances of the sagittarius and fornax pn and dddm-1 in these elements confirm their origin in a population which did not undergo large element enrichment from supernova products . in contrast",
    "the abundances of all elements are much higher , by @xmath350.8dex , than for k  648 , the pn in the metal poor galactic globular cluster m  15 ( @xcite ) , which is also listed in table 8 .    in pn with low mass progenitors ( non type i ) ,",
    "the abundance of o is only marginally affected by agb evolution ( @xmath370.2dex , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the sum of c , n and o should change little through the agb evolution .",
    "the increase in carbon is due to triple-@xmath1 reactions , the products of which are brought to the surface by the 3rd dredge - up . assuming that the derived c / o abundances from the c  ii 4267  line are fairly reliable for the sagittarius pn , both show excess carbon indicating that he shell flashes have occured .",
    "the c abundance of the fornax pn is more reliable and shows a similar level at c / h of 1@xmath910@xmath38 .",
    "in contrast dddm-1 shows low carbon abundance ( 12+log(c / h)@xmath347.1 , @xcite ) and it has been suggested that most of the c was converted into n and that mass loss of the low mass core terminated after only early agb evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the high carbon abundance in the dwarf galaxy pn suggest that these stars have progressed through a number of thermal pulses and suffered he shell burning .",
    "the lower n abundance for he  2 - 436 could be due to relatively little carbon being burnt to n ( the 12+log(c / h ) abundance of he  2 - 436 is 9.2 , whilst it is 8.8 for wray  16 - 423 , taking the c / o ratios at face value ) .    the fundamental question to be answered is : what do the abundances of the pn in the sagittarius and fornax dwarf galaxies tell us about the progenitor stars from which they were formed , and further , what do they reveal of the evolutionary history of these galaxies .",
    "the similarity of s and ar abundances with the smc pn abundances ( @xcite ) is striking and , together with the proposal that the sagittarius galaxy is quite massive ( @xcite ) , suggests that the difference between the smc and sagittarius can partly be understood in terms of gas being stripped from sagittarius and with little interaction occurring with gas clouds , in contrast to the smc .",
    "the fact that the pn abundances are almost as low as in the more metal rich blue compact galaxies ( such as ii  zw  40 , @xcite and ngc  2363 , @xcite ) suggests that these satellite galaxies could be related objects with a different history of gas infall .",
    "if the elevated oxygen abundance of the sagittarius and fornax pn relative to k  648 in m  15 is a guide , then the sagittarius and fornax systems are not simply agglomerations of galactic globular clusters .",
    "the similarity between the abundances of the two sagittarius pn and those of prmg-1 ( @xcite ) , suggests that the latter pn could also belong to the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "if prmg-1 does belong to the sagittarius galaxy and is still bound , then the extent of the galaxy is much larger than found by ibata et al .",
    "dddm-1 also has similar abundances , but due to its location it would be premature to suggest that it was once a member of the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "the similarity of abundances between the sagittarius and fornax pn and some halo pn suggests that some halo stars could have been been captured from satellite dwarf galaxies such as sagittarius and fornax .",
    "the [ o / fe ] value for the sagittarius dwarf has implications for the metal enrichment history of this galaxy .",
    "an [ o / fe ] value significantly higher than solar would rule out sagittarius as a dwarf irregular galaxy , but taking account of the spread in [ fe / h ] deduced from the various published determinations , this argument is weakened .",
    "the presence of a wide metallicity range indicates star formation at different times .",
    "several pieces of evidence point towards the notion that sagittarius was more massive in the past : it falls below the luminosity - metallicity relation of lee ( 1995 ) ; it is being disrupted by the milky way ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; it may have had an escape velocity high enough to retain the gas and form successive generations of stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that [ o / fe ] is @xmath35 @xmath360.2 would argue against significant enrichment from sn type i. in an isolated dwarf galaxy , this value would favour a sn driven wind followed by recapture of the enriched gas with subsequent star formation .",
    "thus , the available element ratios are not inconsistent with two bursts of star formation , although the star formation history of sagittarius must be unusual . in particular , this history may not be directly compared to that of other more distant dwarfs that have not suffered severe interactions with the milky way .",
    "the interation with the galaxy may have caused the gas to escape after a few orbits , and it may have caused prior bursts of star formation .",

    "the track for a given object depends on the phase of the thermal - pulse cycle at which the central star leaves the agb .",
    "since the hydrogen - burning phase lasts several times longer than the helium - burning one , most cspn are assumed to belong to the former category .",
    "in contrast , since the wolf - rayet cspn are known to be hydrogen poor , there is little doubt that they are presently in a helium - burning phase ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the wind emission lines , which are the defining characteristics of wr stars , are expected to disappear on the white - dwarf cooling track : the luminosity quickly drops by a factor of 100 , far below the eddington luminosity .",
    "consequently , [ wc ] stars will still be on the nuclear - burning part of their evolution .",

    "one of the most favored scenarios for forming hydrogen - deficient central stars is the so - called `` very late '' thermal pulse , whereby the helium - flash starts after the cessation of hydrogen - burning ( i.e. when the star is on the white dwarf cooling track ) .",
    "the convective mixing that later occurs transports any remaining hydrogen downwards into hotter layers where it is burned .",
    "the c and o surface abundances predicted in this scenario do not however agree with the observed ones ( @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for the presence of helium - burning central stars among planetary nebulae in the lmc has been presented by dopita et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "helium - burning central stars are expected to evolve on tracks of decreasing luminosity towards higher stellar temperatures .",
    "the final thermal pulse can occur at the tip of the agb or during the post - agb evolution . immediately following the thermal pulse",
    ", the evolution is very fast ( @xcite ) , and stars in an early phase after the thermal pulse may show up as bright infrared sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , during quiescent helium burning , they evolve about three times slower than hydrogen - burning stars of the same core mass",
    ". however the wolf - rayet wind has little effect on the chemical composition of the nebula : during the time of heaviest mass loss following the thermal pulse , the mixing which causes the disappearance of the hydrogen envelope has not yet begun .",
    "galactic planetary nebulae surrounding [ wc ] stars do not show differences in their abundance patterns ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar luminosities of both pn are listed in table 6 based on the magnitudes and black body temperatures of the central stars .",
    "an estimate of the error on the derived luminosities is 20% , resulting from the errors on the extinction , the magnitude and the black body temperature . for he  2 - 436 , a lower limit to the luminosity",
    "can be derived by integration of the 12 and 25@xmath13 m fluxes and the upper limits to the 60 and 100@xmath13 m iras fluxes ; a value of 4600l@xmath11 is derived , consistent with the value in table 6 .",
    "helium - burning central stars can explain why the two sagittarius pn have luminosities which differ by a factor of 2 ( table 6 ) .",
    "the models for helium - burning central stars ( assuming an inert upper layer of hydrogen ) show that their luminosity along an evolutionary track decreases by upto a factor of 0.6 dex , whereas hydrogen - burning central star models keep a constant luminosity before entering their cooling track .",
    "the two pn are expected to have similar core masses : for progenitor masses of 1 m@xmath11 and lower , the final mass is strongly peaked around a value of approximately 0.55 m@xmath11 with very small dispersion ( @xcite ) . only for stars of twice solar and higher masses are significantly higher final masses expected . for hydrogen - burning tracks",
    "this would lead to similar luminosities as well , excluding the white - dwarf cooling track .",
    "the different luminosities indicate that at least one ( the one with the lower luminosity ) is not evolving on a track of quiescent hydrogen burning .",
    "the position on the hr diagram indicates that neither star has entered the white - dwarf cooling track .",
    "he  2 - 436 has a higher luminosity than wray  16 - 423 and the central star is cooler .",
    "the nebula is still young , as indicated by its high density , low ionized mass ( table 6 ) , compact angular size ( unresolved in our images ) and strong infrared emission ; it has shown fast evolution from the agb .",
    "one can hence infer that the star is in an early post - helium - flash evolution .",
    "its luminosity should still be close to the corresponding hydrogen - burning phase . assuming therefore the hydrogen core mass  luminosity relation of vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) , a core mass of 0.59 m@xmath11 is indicated .",
    "wray  16 - 423 is more evolved , based on the lower luminosity , lower density and larger angular size ( the nebula is resolved with a diameter of 1.2@xmath2 ) , as well as lack of infrared emission . assuming an expansion velocity of 15 km s@xmath18 ( @xcite ) and using the distance of 25 kpc to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy",
    ", a dynamical age of 4000 years can be deduced for wray  16 - 423 .",
    "competing factors contribute to the large uncertainty that should be assigned to this figure . as the pn shell enters its energy - driven phase ( @xcite ) , the pressure due to the hot shocked gas filling the inner cavity can accelerate the shell . on the other hand , the outer parts of the shell trace the material expelled during the early superwind phase when the wind velocity might have been lower : the details of the velocity law along the superwind phase",
    "are not known .",
    "the models of vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) or blcker ( 1995a , 1995b ) give estimates for the transition time from the tip of the agb to the post - agb phase and then for the evolutionary time scale on their tracks .",
    "the uncertainty on the former quantity is quite large due to different definitions of the end of the agb between these authors and even changes quite substantially between the models .",
    "a dynamical age of 4000 years is still consistent with the time scale needed by a 1 m@xmath11 star to evolve from the top of the agb to the actual position of the sagittarius pn central stars on a log l ",
    "log t@xmath39 diagram .",
    "provided that the comparison to helium - burning tracks is relevant one can conclude that although no single track in vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) can be uniquely identified with both pn , observationally the results are consistent with wray  16 - 423 and he  2 - 436 evolving on the same track .",
    "wolf - rayet central stars make up about 10 - 15% of the galactic pn population .",
    "they are found both in the disk and bulge , but none are known in the galactic halo .",
    "this indicates a difference between halo / globular cluster pn population ( no [ wc ] stars among ten known pn ) and sagittarius ( two out of two ) .",
    "however the presence of weak emisssion line stars , such as wray  16 - 423 , requires deep spectra and broad stellar features may have been missed .",
    "this difference between halo pn and those in sagittarius could be explained if the halo pn have somewhat lower luminosities , and are therefore unable to sustain a wind .",
    "the fact that , from stellar population studies ( @xcite ) , the bulk of the stellar population in sagittarius appears younger than the galactic halo is consistent with this .",
    "metallicity might also be a factor , however at this stage of evolution the stellar abundances are dominated by self - produced metals .",
    "a possible explanation of the lack of [ wc ] stars in the halo is that the [ wc ] phase at lower core mass could be more confined to the high - luminosity peak following the thermal pulse where evolution is very fast .",
    "the sagittarius dwarf is now heavily distorted by the tidal field of the milky way ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , making it difficult to decide its original type .",
    "even though it appears to have a substantial fraction of intermediate - age stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , the galaxy presently contains no neutral hydrogen ( @xcite ) , an argument favouring a dwarf elliptical over a dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "the gas could have been stripped by its many passages through the plane of the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the [ o / fe ] abundance ratio plotted against the logarithmic oxygen abundance for the sagittarius dwarf , together with data for the milky way and its satellite galaxies and for the dwarf satellites ngc  185 and ngc  205 of m  31 . in this figure",
    "the o abundances are derived from the pn and the fe from the stellar population . the data for ngc  185 and ngc  205 are taken from richer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . for ngc  205",
    "the oxygen abundance is based on lower limits derived from [ o  iii ] and h@xmath19 line fluxes for 9 pn ( @xcite ) , whilst for ngc  185 it is based on spectroscopy of two pn .",
    "the oxygen data for the milky way disk and bulge are from ratag et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "for the fornax dwarf , richer & mccall ( 1995 ) estimate an oxygen abundance 0.4 dex lower than that measured for the pn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) based on the fact that the oxygen abundance is slightly higher for the brightest pn in samples for the lmc , smc and the galaxy .",
    "however it can be argued that if this is the only pn in this galaxy , which is consistent with the mass of the galaxy ( @xcite ) , then such a correction is not applicable . a further argument against applying such",
    "a correction is that for the two sagittarius pn , one ( he  2 - 436 ) is about twice the luminosity of the other whilst their oxygen abundances are very similar . inferring the oxygen abundance of a stellar population based on a few pn is clearly a complex task and not one that can immediately be referred to more massive galaxies where samples are large and the star formation history may be quite different .",
    "the oxygen abundances for ngc  185 and ngc  205 used in figure 4 have been determined by applying a correction to the lower limits based on the behaviour of milky way and magellanic clouds pn samples . from figure 4",
    "it is clear that the [ o / fe ] abundance of the sagittarius galaxy is higher than that in the magellanic clouds by a factor of @xmath35 2 , which also argues against sagittarius having been an smc - like galaxy .",
    "the sagittarius pn have somewhat higher abundances than those in the milky way halo ( see table 8) , typical of younger pn than the halo ones and much higher than k  648 .",
    "mateo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) argue that the specific frequency of rr lyrae variables in sagittarius is low compared with other dwarf elliptical galaxies , which is consistent with a higher metallicity and relative youth of sagittarius with respect to the halo .",
    "this indicates that the halo could not have been made _ entirely _ of dwarf galaxies such as sagittarius .    .",
    "the total absolute magnitude of sagittarius is unknown .",
    "based on the number of rr lyrae stars , mateo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) estimated a total magnitude @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , if sagittarius had a total of 1930 and 310 rr lyrae ( type ab ) stars respectively . alard ( 1996 ) and alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have discovered more than 350 rr lyrae type ab stars in the northern extension of sagittarius alone .",
    "their surveys cover at most 1/5 of the total extension of sgr , judging from the isophotes , so it is concluded that sagittarius contains @xmath42 rr lyrae type ab stars . following the arguments of mateo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , a value of @xmath40 is adopted for sagittarius , which is consistent with a minimum total mass of 10@xmath43m@xmath44 ( @xcite ) .",
    "sagittarius also has at least 4 globular clusters ( @xcite ) but there are a number of globular clusters in the galactic bulge region ( @xmath3330 ) without velocity or distance information that could also be members .",
    "the data accumulated so far ( see in particular @xcite ) indicates that sagittarius is at least as massive as fornax , and it is likely that this galaxy is the most massive of all the dwarf satellite galaxies of the milky way .",
    "it is apparent that the oxygen abundance in dwarf elliptical galaxies is higher than for dwarf irregulars at the same absolute magnitude ( @xcite ) , by about a factor of @xmath352 .",
    "figure 5 shows the dependence of the galaxy luminosity on the oxygen abundance for all the local group dwarfs ( irregulars and ellipticals ) with measured pn or h  ii region o abundances .",
    "this figure shows that , even though the total absolute magnitude of sagittarius is still uncertain , this galaxy shares the location with the typical dwarf ellipticals ngc  185 , ngc  205 , and fornax .",
    "it is concluded that the present study of the sagittarius pn , added to the previous evidence , supports the notion that sagittarius was not a dwarf irregular , but most probably a dwarf elliptical galaxy .",
    "optical spectra of the two planetary nebulae in the sagittarius dwarf galaxy have been analysed and the abundances and physical conditions studied .",
    "both pn display similar abundances , differing considerably only for nitrogen .",
    "the abundance pattern is also very similar to that for the pn in the fornax dwarf galaxy . the abundance of oxygen ( for example ) in these three pn is lower than that of galactic pn , but not as low as for genuine halo pn , such as the pn in the globular cluster m  15 .",
    "broad stellar ( wr ) lines are seen in both nebulae in sagitarius with he  2 - 436 displaying the stronger lines .",
    "the luminosity of he  2 - 436 is about twice that of wray  16 - 423 and the latter has a resolved ionized shell . in order to reconcile the different luminosities and evolutionary characterisitics of he  2 - 423 and wray  16 - 423",
    ", it is suggested that both are on helium burning evolutionary tracks .",
    "the oxygen abundances of the m31 and milky way satellite galaxies , as revealed by their planetary nebulae , are compared and the evidence suggests that both sagittarius and fornax were not dwarf irregulars but more probably dwarf elliptical galaxies before their interaction with the milky way .    the eso staff at la silla and the ntt remote observing team in garching provided excellent support for the observations .",
    "we are very grateful to the south african astronomical observatory for prompt retrieval of the spectroscopic data for the fornax pn from their digital archive .",
    "we would like to thank the referee , g. h. jacoby , for many suggestions which substantially improved the paper .",
