    "there is an increasing desire amongst industrial practitioners of computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) to perform scale - resolving simulations of unsteady compressible flows within the vicinity of complex geometries .",
    "however , current generation industry - standard cfd software  predominantly based on first- or second - order accurate reynolds averaged navier - stokes ( rans ) technology  is not well suited to the task .",
    "henceforth , over the past decade there has been significant interest in the application of high - order methods for mixed unstructured grids to such problems .",
    "popular examples of high - order schemes for mixed unstructured grids include the discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) method , first introduced by reed and hill @xcite , and the spectral difference ( sd ) methods originally proposed under the moniker ` staggered - gird chebyshev multidomain methods ' by kopriva and kolias in 1996 @xcite and later popularised by sun et al .",
    "@xcite . in 2007",
    "huynh @xcite proposed the flux reconstruction ( fr ) approach ; a unifying framework for high - order schemes on unstructured grids that incorporates both the nodal dg schemes of @xcite and , at least for a linear flux function , any sd scheme .",
    "in addition to offering high - order accuracy on unstructured mixed grids , fr schemes are also compact in space , and thus when combined with explicit time marching offer a significant degree of element locality .",
    "this locality makes such schemes extremely good candidates for acceleration using either the vector units of modern cpus or graphics processing units ( gpus ) @xcite .",
    "there exist a variety of approaches for writing accelerated codes .",
    "these include directive based methodologies such as openmp 4.0 and openacc , and language frameworks such as opencl and cuda .",
    "unfortunately , at the time of writing , there exists no single approach which is _ performance portable _ across all major hardware platforms .",
    "codes desiring cross - platform portability must therefore incorporate support for multiple approaches .",
    "further , there is also a growing interest from the scientific community in _ heterogeneous computing _ whereby multiple platforms are employed simultaneously to solve a problem .",
    "the promise of heterogeneous computing is improved resource utilisation on systems with a mix of hardware .",
    "such systems are becoming increasingly common .",
    "pyfr is a high - order fr code for solving the euler and compressible navier - stokes equations on mixed unstructured grids @xcite . written in the python programming language pyfr",
    "incorporates backends for c / openmp , cuda , and opencl .",
    "it is therefore capable of running on conventional cpus , as well as gpus from both nvidia and amd , as well as heterogeneous mixtures of the aforementioned .",
    "the objective of this paper is to demonstrate the ability of pyfr to perform high - order accurate unsteady simulations of flow on mixed unstructured meshes using a heterogeneous hardware platform  demonstrating the concept of ` heterogeneous computing from a homogeneous codebase ' .",
    "specifically , we will undertake simulations of unsteady flow over a cylinder at reynolds number @xmath0 using a mixed unstructured grid of prismatic and tetrahedral elements using a desktop workstation containing an intel xeon e5 - 2697 v2 cpu , an nvidia tesla k40c gpu , and an amd firepro w9100 gpu . at the time of writing",
    "these represent the high - end workstation offerings from the three major hardware vendors .",
    "all are designed for workstations with support for error - correcting code ( ecc ) memory and double precision floating point arithmetic .",
