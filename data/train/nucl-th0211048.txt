    "the existence and decay properties of super - heavy nuclei are one of the most fundamental problems in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "there are now new data which confirm the existence of @xmath3 = 111 and 112 and their connection to lighter decay chains @xcite .",
    "the first data for @xmath4 and @xmath5 also exist @xcite , with suggested @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , but the @xmath8 values are not certain since the connection to lighter nuclei is not known .",
    "theoretical models for super - heavy nuclei have evolved from the macroscopic - microscopic models such as the finite - range droplet model with shell corrections @xcite , to fully microscopic deformed hartree - fock ( hf ) models such as those presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition to their intrinsic many - body nuclear structure importance , theoretical models for the prediction of the decay properties of the super - heavy nuclei are important when designing experiments since the techniques used will depend on the half - life and decay mode .",
    "in this paper we present a new set of hartree - fock results for alpha - decay q - values of super - heavy nuclei .",
    "a global formula is used to calculate the half - lives .",
    "our calculations are based upon a new computational program for solving the axial - symmetric hf equations and the new skyrme interaction skx @xcite .",
    "the reason for exploring results with another skryme interaction beyond those used previously in @xcite and @xcite is that the alpha decay q - value systematics are sensitive to the spherical and deformed shell - effects which depend upon the underlying parameters of the hamiltonians .",
    "there are several modern skyrme parameter sets available , each of them determined with a different weighting and emphasis on the existing nuclear structure properties .",
    "the sly4 parameters @xcite used in @xcite and the msk7 @xcite parameters take into account overall spacing of the single - particle states such as those in @xmath0pb .",
    "( in particular , it is common to constrain the skyrme parameters to give an effective mass of unity which is required by the observed level spacing . )",
    "however , the skx interaction @xcite explicitly incorporates most of the observed single - particle levels in @xmath0pb into the data set which was used to determine the parameter values .",
    "the single - particle energies for some proton and neutron particle states above the fermi surface in @xmath0pb are compared in table i. all of the calculations have some disagreement with experiment , however , skx has the best overall agreement with experiment .",
    "it is important to explore the model - dependences of the hf results for the binding - energies of nuclei above @xmath0pb .    in sec .",

    "the region of the chart of nuclides covered by our calculations is shown in fig .",
    "this includes the region just above @xmath0pb where the alpha - decay q - values are measured , and extends up to the assumed spherical magic numbers of @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the super - heavy predictions .",
    "there are several methods available for solving the schrdinger equation for the single particle wave functions @xmath11 in a skyrme - type potential with axial symmetry .",
    "often a cylindrical coordinate system is chosen and the wave functions are expanded in a deformed harmonic oscillator basis with carefully adjusted oscillator strengths .",
    "then the hamiltonian is diagonalized in an appropriately truncated space of basis states . here",
    ", we solve the schrdinger equation for @xmath11 in coordinate space with a spherical basis for the angular part of the wave function . in this approach",
    "there is a smooth transition to the case of spherical nuclei where the wave function simplifies considerably .",
    "the single - particle wave functions of protons ( @xmath12 ) and neutrons ( @xmath13 ) in a deformed nucleus with axial symmetry are specified by three quantum numbers : the parity @xmath14 , the principal quantum number @xmath15 , and the projection of the total angular momentum on the symmetry - axis @xmath16 .",
    "we expand the wave functions in coordinate space @xmath17 with the radial wave functions @xmath18 and vector - spherical harmonics @xmath19 which are obtained by coupling the orbital angular momentum @xmath20 of the spherical harmonics @xmath21 and the spin @xmath22 of the spinors @xmath23 to the total angular momentum @xmath24 .",

    "the frdm results are similar to the hf in the region where data are available but become more different for the extrapolation to heavier nuclei .",
    "much of the data for the super - heavy nuclei are for odd - even decay chains .",
