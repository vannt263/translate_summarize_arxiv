    "the typical probe ( sensor ) to measure an electric ( e ) field has a size on the order of @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the free - space wavelength of the radiation one intends to measure ) .",
    "one example is a dipole loaded field probe @xcite .",
    "these conventional probes can only measure an e - field strength averaged over the length of the probe .",
    "if one is interested in measuring a field distribution in the neighborhood of a structure with spatial features smaller than @xmath4 , the conventional probe would be problematic .",
    "for example , consider metasurface structures @xcite .",
    "these metasurfaces are typically composed of periodic arrays of inclusions or scatterers .",
    "these scatterers are typically sub - wavelength in size ( on the order of @xmath5 or smaller ) .",
    "furthermore , these scatterers have even smaller sub - structures ( gaps , holes , apertures ) that can be as small as @xmath6 . with current methods , it is virtually impossible to measure e - field distributions on these sub - wavelength scales .",
    "the technique we demonstrate to perform high spatial resolution mapping of rf fields could be used in design verification and characterization of the metasurfaces and other sub - wavelength devices and structures .    to measure e - fields with sub - wavelength resolution , we take advantage of a recently - demonstrated technique that uses atoms as field probes @xcite-@xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate , for the first time , its spatial resolution capability .",
    "the technique uses room - temperature rubidium atoms as probes , exploiting the sensitivity of their high - lying rydberg states to radio frequency ( rf ) radiation .",
    "( the term rf is used here to cover the conventional rf , microwave , millimeter wave , and sub - terahertz spectra . )",
    "this sensitivity reflects the large transition matrix elements ( @xmath7 , on the order of @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) for rf transitions between rydberg states .",
    "we measure an autler - townes splitting @xcite of rydberg energy levels in these atoms to obtain the rf field strength .",
    "the energy levels are measured using electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .    here",
    "we describe the physical principles underlying the technique .",
    "consider a sample of stationary four - level atoms illuminated by a single weak (  probe \" ) light field , as depicted in fig  [ 4level ] .",
    "when the frequency of the light matches the @xmath10 to @xmath11 atomic resonance , the atoms scatter light from the incident beam and reduce the transmitted light intensity .",
    "if a second strong (  coupling \" ) light field is applied resonant with the @xmath11 to @xmath12 transition , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 states are mixed to form dressed states which are close in energy .",
    "the excitation amplitudes from @xmath10 to each of these two dressed states then have opposite signs , leading to destructive quantum interference of these excitation pathways . as such",
    ", a transparency window is opened for the probe light : probe light transmission is increased .",
    "this is the phenomenon known as eit @xcite .",
    "if one applies an rf field which couples states @xmath12 and @xmath13 , a third dressed state is introduced between the two involved in eit which leads to constructive interference in the probe absorption .",
    "this splits the eit resonance in two , and for resonant driving fields the new transmission maxima are split by the rabi frequency @xmath14 of the @xmath12 ",
    "@xmath13 transition @xcite .",
    "this is known as autler - townes splitting of the eit signal @xcite .",
    "therefore the frequency splitting @xmath15 between the transmission maxima allows a measurement of the e - field amplitude of the rf field via @xmath16 where @xmath17 is planck s constant and @xmath7 is the electric dipole moment of the rf transition @xmath12 to @xmath13 .    in order to measure the field amplitude for different rf frequencies , different states @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be chosen .",
    "state @xmath12 is selected by tuning the wavelength of the coupling laser",
    ". a large range of atomic transitions can be selected , allowing measurements of microwave fields over a correspondingly wide selection of frequencies .",
    "in essence , the atoms act as highly - tunable , resonant rf detectors .",
    "this is a significant benefit of using rydberg atoms as field probes . in @xcite ,",
    "we use this fact to show how the technique can be used for broadband measurements of rf e - fields , ranging from 1  ghz to 500  ghz .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ vaporcell ] .",
    "we use a cylindrical glass vapor cell of length 75  mm and diameter 25  mm containing rubidium-85 ( @xmath18rb ) atoms . the levels @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 correspond respectively to the @xmath18rb @xmath19 ground state , @xmath20 excited state , and two rydberg states .",
    "the probe is a 780  nm laser (  red \" ) which is scanned across the @xmath19",
    " @xmath20 transition .",
    "the probe beam is focused to a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 80  @xmath21 m , with a power of 120  nw to keep the intensity below the saturation intensity of the transition .",
    "figure  [ doppler ] shows a typical transmission signal as a function of relative probe detuning @xmath22 .",
    "the global shape of the curve is the doppler absorption spectrum of @xmath18rb at room temperature . to produce an eit signal ,",
    "we apply a counter - propagating coupling laser ( wavelength @xmath23  nm ,  blue \" ) with a power of 22  mw , focused to a fwhm of 100  @xmath21 m .",
    "as an example , tuning the coupling laser near the @xmath20 ",
    "@xmath24 rydberg transition results in distinct eit transmission peaks corresponding to the transitions from @xmath19 to the allowed @xmath20 hyperfine sublevels ( @xmath25 ) , which are strongly coupled to the fine - structure - split @xmath26 and @xmath27 rydberg states .",
    "the peaks for the strongest of these cascades are visible atop the doppler profile in fig  [ doppler ] .",
    "differential doppler shifts between the probe and coupling beams alter the frequency separations between eit peaks in the probe transmission spectrum .",
    "splittings of @xmath20 hyperfine states are scaled by @xmath28 , while splittings of rydberg states are scaled by @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the latter factor is relevant to measurements of rf - induced splittings of eit peaks .",
    "hereafter , for each eit system we investigate , we focus on the strongest peak , corresponding to the @xmath30  @xmath31 transition .",
    "we take this peak to be at @xmath32 . in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , we use heterodyne detection . we modulate the blue laser amplitude with a 30  khz square wave and",

    "when an electromagnetic ( em ) wave is incident onto a hollow dielectric cylinder , standing waves typically develop inside the cylinder due to internal reflections from the cylinder walls .",
    "the resulting field distribution will vary depending on the em frequency . using the technique explained in the previous section , we image the field inside our glass vapor cell ( which is , electromagnetically , a hollow dielectric cylinder ) for two different rf frequencies : 104.77  ghz and 17.04  ghz . for the 104.77  ghz measurements , we deliver the rf with an open - ended waveguide ( see fig .",

    "it is challenging to perform such a numerical simulation of the actual experimental setup at high frequencies because of computer memory requirements .",
    "this is partially due to the small rf wavelength at 104.77  ghz , and the relatively large cell size ( several rf wavelengths at 104.77  ghz ) . to overcome these issues we did the following .",
    "instead of modeling the actual open - ended waveguide placed 0.14  m from the cell , we performed a numerical simulation for a plane - wave impinging on the cell with a field strength of 2.8  v / m . in order to determine this field - strength value for the plane - wave ,",
    "the open - ended waveguide source antenna was modeled independently and the numerical simulated far - field radiation pattern and field strength was determined . using the measured working distance and power mentioned above ,",
