    "consideration of fundamental theories such as m / string theory in the cosmological context continues to attract attention in the literature .",
    "one of the interesting questions is the role of the tachyon in string theory and cosmology .",
    "the great progress in our understanding about tachyon condensation was made in the past decade@xcite but a lot of interesting issues are still open . among the most important ones is a better understanding of the dynamics in tachyon condensation process .",
    "open string field theory ( osft ) @xcite gives us a tachyon effective action@xcite which is derived from first principles and correctly describes tachyon physics and could represent most exhaustive framework for studying tachyon dynamics .",
    "the tachyon dynamics even in the case without gravity represents a nontrivial task which was widely studied @xcite , while considering osft coupled to the gravity in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) type of metric makes this problem more nontrivial because of the dalambert operators in curved spaces that would appear in the action .",
    "this fact makes mathematical investigation of this problem much more complicated but will benefit us with desired time - dependent solution interpolating between different vacua .    in this",
    "work new numerical rolling solution for tachyon condensation will be presented .",
    "we will show that consideration of osft coupled to the gravity which represents more realistic situation from cosmological point of view allows the existence of the rolling tachyon configuration which was forbidden by energy conservation law in the case without gravity .",
    "the action of bosonic cubic string field theory has the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the open string coupling constant , @xmath2 is brst operator , @xmath3 is noncommutative product and @xmath4 is the open string field containing component fields which correspond to all the states in string fock space .",

    "could probably be generalized to the case of full osft action because for the action with cubic interaction solution interpolating between maximum and minimum in the effective potential has to interpolate between vacua with different energy .",
    "in this section we consider more realistic case when gravity is included @xmath45 here @xmath46 and we will work in units where @xmath47 . as a particular metric",
    "we will consider a frw one @xmath48 for which the beltrami - laplace operator for spatially - homogeneous configurations takes the form @xmath49 .",
    "scalar field and friedmann equations are @xmath50 @xmath51 inclusion the gravity drastically changes the question of existence of the dynamical interpolation between maximum and minimum of the scalar field potential .",
    "this happens because then there are no restrictions from energy conservation law .",
    "according to the friedmann and scalar field equations we can expect the scalar field rolling solution and hubble function satisfying the following boundary conditions @xmath52 or vice - versa ( in terms of @xmath40 ) .",
    "note that from cosmological perspective we are interested only in positive values for the hubble function and thus we do not consider negative sign in front of the square root in ( [ bc - gr ] ) .",
    "to analyze physical situation let us consider potential in which motion is expected .",
    "naive extraction of potential from the model action ( [ action - gr ] ) results in @xmath53 .",
    "the constant @xmath54 represents the d - brane tension which according to sen s conjecture must be added to cancel the negative energy appearing due to the presence of tachyon .",
    "we have obtained two type of solutions .",
    "the first one is an ordinary rolling solution which starts from @xmath55 and goes towards configuration @xmath56 which is associated with the true vacuum .",
    "this solution can be interpreted as a description of the d - brane decay .",
    "the second one is a rolling solution which goes in the opposite direction , which appears in this model possibly because of the non - locality in the interaction .",
    "it is known that nonlocal dynamics has many interesting properties which are not present in the local case .",
    "in particular the `` slop effect '' @xcite which is present in the obtained solutions ( fig .",
    "[ rolling - solution - ord ] , [ rolling - solution - ph ] ) when the scalar field goes beyond the values from which the scalar field configuration starts  situation which is not possible in the local models .",
    "potentially a similar effect can initiate non - symmetry in the potential in ekpyrotic @xcite and cyclic cosmology @xcite .",
    "for numerical calculations we operate with scalar field equation of motion ( [ eom - gr ] ) and the difference of equations ( [ fr - eq ] ) @xmath57 the outline of the numerical scheme is the following ) instead of cubic one as well as for p - adic string model at least for @xmath58 .",
    "obtained interpolating solutions between corresponding maximum and minimum of the tachyon potential look very similar to one which will be presented in section [ rolling - tachyon - solution ] and will be presented in @xcite .",
    "it looks that cosmology effaces difference between cubic and quartic interaction for the type of solutions indicated above . ]    * for equations ( [ fr2 ] ) we introduce lattice in @xmath59 variable and then solve resulting system of nonlinear equations using iterative relaxation solver using discrete @xmath60 norm to control error tolerance . *",

    "derivatives in @xmath59 variable were approximated using 4th order finite differences on uniform lattice ( symmetric scheme ) . * in order to exclude possible artifacts of this specific numerical scheme we tried chebyshev - pseudospectral method which is known to have impressive exponential convergence @xcite .",

    "taking into account that acceleration of the universe is one of the most fascinating processes of the modern cosmology many authors tried to explain among other possibilities with a possible explanation via scalar field .",
    "it is interesting that cosmology gives us this solution owing to coupling our action ( [ action ] ) to a frw metric and the consequent inclusion of a hubble friction term which leads to time - dependent rolling solution with exponentially decreasing oscillations around the minimum .",
    "moreover because generally speaking string scale does not exactly coincide with plank mass we obtain some freedom in settling @xmath74 parameter for numerical calculations which enters into friedmann equations and as a result govern the value of hubble function @xmath75 . thus decreasing the value of @xmath74 leads to more smooth profile for rolling solution while increasing @xmath74 results in higher oscillations of the solution in comparison to those presented on the fig .",
    "[ rolling - solution - ord ] and [ rolling - solution - ph ] , more details will be presented in @xcite . during the process of completion of this work appeared @xcite in which osft tachyon in the dilaton background was considered and time - like rolling tachyon solution were obtained . because dilaton appears from the same string sector as graviton including the dilaton into the tachyon action can qualitatively reproduce behavior of the tachyon in the curved spaces .    concluding this section we would like to summarize that we obtained time dependent accelerating solution interpolating between unstable and the true vacua ( see fig .",
    "[ rolling - solution - ord ] ) which can be interpreted as being responsible for acceleration of the universe during this rolling from unstable vacuum to the true vacuum , after which it disappears .",
    "evolution of the scalar field in the opposite direction is also possible with the hubble function in form of increasing kink when scale factor @xmath76 starts from the constant plateau and exponentially grows , which seems counter intuitive but can be related to late time acceleration .",
    "the witten s cubic open bosonic string filed theory in the level truncation approximation was considered .",
    "it was shown that the energy conservation law determines existence of rolling tachyon solution . as a result it was explicitly shown that the non - existence of the rolling solution in the minkowski case is a necessary consequence of the energy conservation law of the system . the modification of conservation law in the presence of the gravity is discussed . the first rolling solution for tachyon condensation in this theory",
    "is presented and possible cosmological consequences are discussed .",
    "although only lowest excitation in the full osft were taken into account there are solid reasons to suppose that the general picture for the tachyon condensation process will be the same in the case of full osft .",
