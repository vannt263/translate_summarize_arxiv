    "<S> as the hopping amplitude ratio @xmath14 starts to increase from 1 , the dirac points move away from each other . when @xmath14 reaches @xmath77 , two dirac points merge into a single one at the corner of the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath14 increases further , there is no solution to the @xmath72-invariant points , thereby the dirac points vanish , with a gap opening simultaneously . as a result , @xmath56 is the critical point of the quantum phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we can interpret the above conclusion in a more intuitive way by mapping the brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice into that of the square lattice , as shown in fig.[fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that such a mapping is not surjective , which means that the image of the brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice is part of the brillouin zone of the square lattice . in the parameter interval of @xmath78 , </S>",
    "<S> the image covers the @xmath28-protected degenerate points @xmath43 in the brillouin zone of the square lattice , as shown in fig.[fig2]a . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there always exist two points @xmath59 in the brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice mapping into the @xmath28-protected degenerate points @xmath43 in the brillouin zone of the square lattice . when @xmath56 , the two equivalent points locating at the corners of the brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice map into the @xmath28-protected degenerate points @xmath43 , as shown in fig.[fig2]b </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the dirac points on the honeycomb lattice merge . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath79 , the image of the brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice can not cover the @xmath28-protected degenerate points @xmath43 , as shown in fig.[fig2]c . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is no point in the brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice mapping into the @xmath28-protected degenerate points @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the dirac points disappear and a gap opens .    * discussion*.    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have found a hidden symmetry on the honeycomb lattice and proved that the hidden symmetry protects the dirac points on the honeycomb lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the hidden symmetry evolves along with the parameters , such as the bond angle @xmath0 and the hopping amplitude ratio @xmath14 , which provides a perfect explanation on the moving and merging of the dirac points and the quantum phase transition on the honeycomb lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our research unfolds a new perspective on the symmetry protected band degeneracy , which is totally different from the conventional ones , such as the band degeneracy protected by point groups or time reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> such novel hidden symmetry can greatly enrich and deepen our understanding of the band degeneracy , which will have important applications in modern condensed matter physics , especially , in the topics of dirac ( weyl ) semimetals and other topological semimetals .    * methods *    * the transformation of the wave vectors under the action of the operator @xmath28 . * the square lattice is invariant under the action of the operator @xmath28 , which is anti - unitary . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that the bloch functions of the square lattice model have the form as @xmath80 where @xmath81 with @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the hidden symmetry operator @xmath28 acts on the bloch functions as follows @xmath83 } \\label{bloch2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath28 is the symmetry operator for the square lattice , @xmath84 must be a bloch function of the square lattice model . </S>",
    "<S> comparing equation ( [ bloch2 ] ) with equation ( [ bloch ] ) , we have @xmath85 which can be regarded as the transformation of the wave vector under the action of the operator @xmath28 </S>",
