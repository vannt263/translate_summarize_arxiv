    "the current letter is intended to communicate new observations based on numerical solutions of the two - phase stefan problem with kinetics .",
    "the simulations reveal some previously unknown features of this dynamically diverse system .",
    "namely , it exhibits the phenomenon of frequency locking in response to a spatially - periodic perturbation of the medium .    the free - boundary problem that is",
    "the subject of the paper  arises naturally as a mathematical model of a variety of exothermic phase transition type processes , such as condensed - state combustion ( also known as self - propagating high - temperature synthesis or shs @xcite ) ,   solidification with undercooling @xcite , laser induced evaporation @xcite , rapid crystallization in thin films @xcite etc .",
    "this study represents a natural extension of the numerical experiments described in @xcite , where it was demonstrated that , due to the competition between the heat release at the interface and the heat dissipation by the medium , the system generates a variety of complex thermokinetic oscillations .",
    "the dynamical patterns exhibited by the unperturbed system , as the governing parameters are varied , include hopf bifurcation , period doubling cascades leading to chaotic pulsations , shilnikov - hopf bifurcation etc .",
    "the new feature that was added to the setting is a variable initial concentration of the so - called deficient component which controls the reaction rate in the case of the combustion synthesis .",
    "we assume the concentration to be a periodically perturbed constant . while the original objective of our experiments was to study the dependence of the mean propagation velocity on the perturbation frequency and amplitude , we have noticed that the dynamics was qualitatively substantially different from that of the unperturbed problem .",
    "what we observed was a variety of quasi - periodic and complex periodic regimes with periods that are various multiples of the perturbation period .",
    "these observations present a convincing evidence that we are dealing here with the phenomenon of frequency locking .    the physical phenomena modeled by periodically driven dynamical systems appear in many fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) such as lasers , superconductors ( josephson s junctions ) , mechanical engineering , etc .",
    "theoretical as well as numerical studies show that periodic forcing can drive these systems to exhibit rich patterns of behavior that includes mode loking , with the mode - locked bands usually having the structure of the so - called arnold s tongues in the amplitude - frequency parameter space .",
    "it is necessary to mention that the analysis or numerical simulation or a combination of thereof is usually carried out for a finite - dimensional system even if the original physical system is infinite - dimensional .",
    "the reduction in such cases is based on an assumption of a certain ansatz which consequently leads to an ode . at the same time",
    "the perturbation is usually external to the base system and it is periodic in time . in our case , however , we make no attempt of such reduction , neither are we aware of any ansatz for a solution leading to it , while _ the internal forcing is _ _ periodic in _ _ space _ , and the system remains formally autonomous .",
    "below we present some examples of numerical solutions and a crude map of a basic resonance band in the amplitude - frequency parameter space that represents an arnold s tongue .",
    "we remind the reader that every point in the parameter space is a result of numerical simulation of a nontrivial free - interface problem for a partial differential equation .",
    "thus , the sharp interface model of combustion synthesis presents a very natural and transparent example of the frequency locking phenomenon for a pde .",
    "in the context of combustion of condensed matter a wave of exothermic chemical reaction transforms a solid combustible mixture directly into solid product .",
    "the 1-d model involves differential equations for the temperature @xmath0 of the mixture and the relative concentration of the so - called deficient reactant @xmath1 ( see e.g. shkadinsky _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the thermal diffusivity , @xmath4 is the chemical reaction rate , and @xmath5 is the heat release .    due to a strong temperature dependence of the reaction",
    "there is a well defined narrow region ( flame front ) where the bulk of chemical reaction and the heat release occur .",
    "thus the distributed chemical reaction can be replaced by the @xmath6-function ( see zeldovich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath7 located at the interface @xmath8 between the fresh , @xmath9 and burned @xmath10 material .",
    "the equation with the @xmath6-function source is rewritten as a system of two heat equations coupled at the interface . in the context of solidification with undercooling @xcite or rapid crystallization of thin films",
    "@xcite , the free - interface model studied below is conceptually even simpler : the latent heat of the phase transition released at the interface must be diffused by the surrounding matter .",
    "therefore we shall be concerned with the following _ appropriately non - dimensionalized _ free - interface problem : find @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that @xmath13=v(t)\\quad\\mathrm{for}\\,t>0,\\label{kc}\\\\ u_{x}^{+}(s(t),t)-u_{x}^{-}(s(t),t)=v(t)\\quad\\mathrm{for}\\,t>0 , \\label{jc}%\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the interface velocity , @xmath15 is its position , @xmath16 is the temperature , and the derivatives @xmath17 and @xmath18 are taken from right side and left side of the free interface respectively . at @xmath19 the surrounding matter is assumed to be at the temperature of the fresh combustible , while the temperature of the burned matter as well as its gradient is bounded : @xmath20    under reasonable assumptions on the kinetics functions @xmath21 one can rigorously prove that the free - interface problem ( [ he])-([jc ] ) possesses global in time , uniformly bounded classical solutions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one should not regard the rigorous proof of the existence and uniform boundedness of solutions as a futile academic exercise but rather view it as a verification of correctness of the model .",
    "it provides a firm foundation for the numerical simulations presented in the paper . in particular , the proof of uniform boundedness of solutions underscores the dynamical robustness of the model .",
    "for reader s convenience in this section we give a brief overview of the unforced dynamics ( see @xcite ) , i.e. , with @xmath22 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the non - equilibrium interface condition ( [ kc ] ) in the form : @xmath23:=1+\\alpha j(u(s(t),t ) ) \\label{disp8}%\\ ] ] we shall assume that the function @xmath24 is normalized in such a way that @xmath25 which can be achieved by rescaling variables .",
    "this assumption makes the problems with different kinetics identical in terms of linearization about the basic solution .",
    "we note that the variables are selected so that the _ interface propagates to the left_.    in order to clarify the meaning of the ( positive ) parameter @xmath26 which is the main instability parameter , we note that for the arrhenius type kinetics @xmath27 \\label{arh1}%\\ ] ] @xmath26 is the scaled activation energy for the exothermic chemical reaction that occurs at the interface , and @xmath28 is the temperature ratio of the fresh and burned material for the traveling wave solution .",
    "the problem ( [ he])-([jc ] ) has a unique traveling wave solution @xmath29 provided @xmath30 is monotone .",
    "the linear stability analysis indicates that the loss of stability occurs via a supercritical hopf bifurcation at @xmath31 , the corresponding frequency is @xmath32 @xmath33    [ c]|llllllllllllllllllll| & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 + & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 + & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 + & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 + & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 + & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 + & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 + & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & + & & & & & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & + & & & & & & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & + & & & & & & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & & @xmath34 & + & & & & & & & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & & & & @xmath34 + & & & & & & & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & & & & & @xmath34 + & & & & & & & & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & & & & & @xmath34 + & & & & & & & & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & & @xmath34 & @xmath34 & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & & & @xmath34 & & & & & & & & +    we have demonstrated in @xcite that depending on the parameters , the system exhibits dynamical regimes that include a hopf bifurcation followed by classical feigenbaum s cascade of period doubling leading to chaotic pulsations , a shilnikov - hopf bifurcation etc .    for numerical simulations below we employed an explicit finite - difference numerical code in the coordinate system attached to the interface @xmath35 .",
    "problem ( [ he])-([jc ] ) is considered on a finite interval @xmath36 with the dirichlet condition @xmath37 simulating the decay of the solution at @xmath19 and neumann condition @xmath38 reflecting stabilization of the temperature far behind the interface in the burned matter ( solid phase ) .in view of the fact that the dynamics of the problem requires a very fine temporal resolution ( to resolve sharp changes in the velocity ) , our experience shows that there is no advantage in using implicit methods in this case ( see @xcite for detail ) .",
    "we note that in mathematical terms , the free boundary problem in ( [ he])-([jc ] ) governs the temporal evolution in the infinitely - dimensional `` phase '' space of functions @xmath39 and scalars @xmath40 .",
    "one way to present results would be through graphs of @xmath12 versus @xmath41 and time histories @xmath14 vs.  @xmath42 .",
    "we also represent dynamics through projections of the infinitely - dimensional phase space onto the 3-dimensional space @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "i.e. , the functional profile @xmath44 is represented by three values : at the interface and at two points equidistant from it .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the phenomenon of frequency locking for the driven free - boundary problem ( [ he])-([jc ] ) . to this end",
    "we choose the initial mass concentration to be in the form of the harmonically perturbed unity : @xmath45 note that unlike typical forced problems , the perturbation here is a function of the dependent variable of the problem @xmath46 thus , strictly speaking , the problem remains autonomous .",
    "therefore the driving frequency @xmath47  and the frequency of the periodic solution , as seen in the power spectra and temporal dynamics in the figures below , are not the same . of course , it is possible to introduce a new time @xmath48 , which would make the perturbation ",
    "time-dependent and the problem non - autonomous .",
    "however , it introduces a stiff highly - variable coefficient @xmath49 at the time derivative of the heat equation that makes numerical solution substantially more challenging .",
    "parameters in ( [ arh1 ] ) were selected to be @xmath50 @xmath51 which correspond to a regime with simple periodic oscillations just past the hopf biurcation for the unperturbed problem .",
    "we vary the forcing amplitude @xmath52 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 with an increment of @xmath55 and the frequency @xmath47 from @xmath56 to @xmath57 with the step @xmath58 the results show  typical structures of the arnold s tongues in the @xmath59-parameter plane .",
    "note that for every pair of parameters the computation involves numerical solving a nontrivial free - interface problem , and the computational cost of an exhausting analysis of an extended domain in the parameter plane becomes prohibitive .",
    "table 1 represents a crude outline of one of arnold s tongues .",
    "we note that in addition to the main tongue one can  also observe what seems to be smaller resonant tongues that correspond to higher order resonances .",
    "the resolution of the computations however , does not allow us to make a definitive judgement concerning additional tongues .",
    "next we discuss several representative solutions of the forced problem for various parameter sets .",

    "5 demonstrates an example of what appears to be a chaotic trajectory , which can be incurred from the power spectrum .",

    "there are a number of complex features observed in dynamical response of the van der pol system @xcite and other finite - dimensional counterparts that one would attempt to verify for our system .",
    "one would naturally ask , for instance , whether the arnold s tongues represent a dense set with its complement forming a cantor set in the @xmath69-plane , . whether the feigenbaum sequences occur within the tongues etc .",
