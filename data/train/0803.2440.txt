    "because of increasing interests in nano - structures with a spin degree of freedom incorporated , the local spin valve ( lsv ) , where a layer of normal metal ( nm ) or insulator is sandwiched by two layers of ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) , has been considered as the prototype of experimental setup for demonstration of spin dependent effects , such as gmr,@xcite magnetization switching,@xcite _",
    "etc_. however , it is not easy for precisely analyzing the spin transport based on lsv in experiment .",
    "the reason is that , accompanying the electrical current flowing across the detection ferromagnetic contact , the spurious effects such as anisotropy magnetoresistance and hall effect due to the fm contact are also involved.@xcite this problem can partially removed by using nonlocal lateral spin valve ( nlsv ) , where only spin current flows across the detection fm contact.@xcite recently , several experiments of metallic spin injection and detection had been carried out on nlsv.@xcite from these experiments , important parameters of spin transport , such as spin diffusion length , are obtained.diffusion_review_j_bass    however , most of those experiments focused on collinear magnetic configuration , in which the magnetization of injection source and detection drain are arranged to be parallel or antiparallel . on the other hand ,",

    "little effort has been put on the noncollinear spin transport in nlsv so far . for nlsv ,",
    "it is interesting to know whether or not we can also obtain _ sizable _ stt , and how the spin current behaves when carried by the diffusion of spin instead of the electrically assistant drift of spin . recently , the current induced magnetization switching was realized in nlsv,@xcite which gave a strong evidence of the presence of stt effect even in nlsv .    in this paper , by combining the diffusion equation and the magnetoelectronic circuit theory,@xcite we investigate theoretically the spin transport in nlsv with non - collinear magnetic configurations .",
    "the angular magnetoresistance ( amr ) in nlsv is discussed for systems with metallic fm@xmath0 nm contacts and tunnelling contacts .",
    "it is also shown that because of the spin accumulation at the normal metal side of fm@xmath0 nm contact , stt could be acted on the ferromagnet . when the length of nm stripe is less than the spin diffusion length in nm , we found that stt in nlsv is comparable with that in lsv .",
