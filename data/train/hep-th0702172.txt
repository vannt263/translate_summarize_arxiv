    "we introduce in the next section a brief description of the kinematical formalism @xcite for describing classical elementary spinning particles .",
    "the kinematical group of spacetime symmetries not only states the symmetries and conservation laws but also provides the classical variables we need to describe an elementary particle .",
    "the dirac particle , a classical system which satisfies dirac s equation when quantized , is summarized in section [ sec : dirac ] .",
    "it is poincar invariant but the spacetime symmetry group has been recently enlarged @xcite to include spacetime dilations and local rotations , so that the classical dirac particle has a larger kinematical group of symmetries .",
    "classical electromagnetism usually analyses interactions between spinless test point particles .",
    "if electromagnetism is a long range and also a short - range interaction it suggests that the same law applies at large and short distances and therefore that a scale invariance is involved .",
    "we have models of spinning particles which have a spacetime dilation invariance and we take advantage of this fact to analyse a long and a short range interaction among them and to check its behaviour when the spin is supressed . in section [ sec : lag ] , we construct a lagrangian for describing the interaction between two dirac particles which is invariant under this enlarged group . because it is also invariant under spacetime dilations , it will describe a long and short - range interaction , which suggests a kind of generalization of the instantaneous electromagnetic interaction , because it has a coulomb limit when the spin of the particles is smeared out .",
    "we also discuss there its structure in a synchronous time description of the evolution .",
    "section [ sec : int ] is devoted to the analysis of the evolution of two particles of the same charge when the spins are parallel to each other .",
    "one of the salient features is the possibility of formation , from the classical point of view , of metastable bound states for dirac particles of the same charge , when some boundary conditions are fulfilled .",
    "because all known elementary particles , the quarks and leptons , are spinning particles and it seems that there are no spinless elementary particles in nature , we took the challenge of obtaining a classical formalism for describing spin .",
    "the interest of a classical description of spinning matter is not important in itself , because matter , at this level behaves according to the laws of quantum mechanics . but finer a classical description of elementary matter a deeper quantum mechanical formalism , because we will have at hand , when quantizing the system , more classical variables to deal with , and therefore with a more clear physical and/or geometrical interpretation .",
    "a second feature is that a classical formalism supplies models . both goals , in my opinion , have been successfully achieved .    the kinematical formalism for describing elementary spinning particles @xcite , previously aimed for the spin description of matter , has proven to be a general framework for the description of elementary particles , because it supplies a very precise definition of an elementary particle which has , as a quantum counterpart , wigner s definition .",
    "all elementary systems described within this formalism have the feature that when quantized their hilbert space of pure states carries a projective unitary irreducible representation of the kinematical group .",
    "it is through feynman s path integral approach that both formalisms complement each other .",
    "it is based upon the four fundamental principles : relativity principle , atomistic principle , variational principle and uncertainty principle .",
    "the relativity principle states that there exists a set of equivalent observers , historically called _ inertial observers _ , for whom the laws of physics must be the same .",
    "they are defined with respect to each other by a spacetime transformation group , usually called the kinematical group of the formalism .",
    "the atomistic principle admits that matter can not be divided indefinitely .",
    "matter does not statisfy the hypothesis of the continuum .",
    "after a finite number of steps in the division of matter we reach an ultimate object , an _ elementary particle_. the distinction between an elementary particle and any other finite system is that an elementary particle has no excited states and , if not destroyed , it can never be modified , so that all possible states are only kinematical modifications of any one of them .",
    "this implies that the states of an elementary can be described by a finite set of variables .",
    "the variational principle recognizes that the the action of the evolution of any mechanical system between some initial and final states must be stationary .",
    "this completes the classical framework . for the quantum description we must susbtitute this last variational principle by the uncertainty principle , in the form proposed by feynman :",
    "all paths of the evolution of any mechanical system between some initial and final states are equally probable . for each path",
    "a probability amplitude is defined , which is a complex number of the same magnitude but whose phase is the action of the system between the end points along the corresponding path . in this way ,",
    "classical and quantum mechanics are described in terms of exactly the same set of classical variables .",
    "this formalism determines that these variables , which define the initial and final states of the evolution in the variational description , are a finite set of variables which necessarily span a homogeneous space of the kinematical group .",
    "we call them the kinematical variables of the particle .",
    "the manifold they span is larger than the configuration space and in addition to the time and the independent degrees of freedom it also includes the derivatives of the independent degrees of freedom up to one order less the highest order they have in the lagrangian .",
    "the lagrangian for describing these systems will be thus dependent on these kinematical variables and their next order time derivative . if the evolution is described in terms of some group invariant evolution parameter @xmath0 , then , when writting the lagrangian not in terms of the independent degrees of freedom but as a function of the kinematical variables and their @xmath1derivatives , it becomes a homogeneous function of first degree of the @xmath2derivatives of all kinematical variables .",
    "the formalism is completely general in the sense that it can accomodate any kinematical group we consider as the spacetime symmetry group of the theory .",
    "but at the same time it is very restrictive , because once this kinematical group is fixed the kind of classical variables which define the initial and final states of an elementary particle in a variational approach , are restricted to belong to homogeneous spaces of the group .",
    "this kinematical group is the fundamental object of the formalism and must be defined as a preliminary statement .",
    "we call the formalism _ kinematical _ , to stress this fact . for the galilei and poincar groups ,",
    "a general spinning elementary particle is just a localized and orientable mechanical system . by localized",
    "we mean that to analyse its evolution in space we have just to describe the evolution of a single point @xmath3 , where the charge is located and in terms of which the possible interactions are determined .",
    "this point @xmath3 also represents the centre - of - mass of the system for spinless particles , while for spinning ones must necessarily be a different point than @xmath4 , the centre - of - mass , very well defined classically and where we can locate the mass of the particle .",
    "it is the motion of the charge around the centre of mass which gives rise to a classical interpretation of the _ zitterbewegung _ and also to the dipole structure of the particle . by orientable we mean that in addition to the description of the evolution of the point charge we also need to describe the change of orientation of the system by analyzing the evolution of a local comoving and rotating frame attached to that point .",
    "an elementary spinning particle is thus described as we use to describe a rigid body but with some differences : we have not to talk about size or shape and the point does not represent the centre - of - mass but rather the centre - of - charge .",
    "it is allowed to satisfy a fourth order differential equation and , for a dirac particle , it moves at the speed of light .",
    "for a relativistic particle the spacetime symmetry group is the poincar group . in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have shown that this spacetime symmetry group for a classical spinning particle which satisfies dirac s equation when quantized , can be enlarged to include also spacetime dilations and local rotations of the body frame associated to the particle .",
    "we denote this group for the classical dirac particle by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the weyl group , i.e. , the poincar group @xmath7 enlarged with spacetime dilations and @xmath8 is the group of local rotations of the body frame , which commutes with @xmath6 .",
    "the lagrangian for a free dirac particle is also invariant under this enlarged group @xmath9 .",
    "if we consider this new group as the kinematical group of the theory , then the kinematical variables of a dirac particle are reduced to time @xmath10 , position of a point @xmath3 , where the charge of the particle is located , its velocity @xmath11 with the constraint @xmath12 , the orientation @xmath13 which can be interpreted as the orientation of a local frame with origin at point @xmath3 and characterized by three parameters of a suitable parameterization of the rotation group and , finally , a phase @xmath14 of the internal motion of the charge around the centre - of - mass .",
    "if the particle has spin @xmath15 and mass @xmath16 , then a length scale factor @xmath17 and a time scale factor @xmath18 can be defined , such that all kinematical variables for the variational description can be taken dimensionless .",
    "it is this argument which justifies the enlargement of the spacetime symmetry group , to include spacetime dilations which preserve the speed of light .",
    "the spinning particle has thus a centre - of - mass @xmath4 , which is always different than the point @xmath3 , such that , for a free particle and for the centre - of - mass observer is at rest , and the point @xmath3 is moving in circles at the speed of light , around the point @xmath4 in a flat trajectory contained in a plane orthogonal to the spin @xmath19 .",
    "the kinematical variable @xmath14 describes the phase of this internal or _",
    "zitterbewegung _ motion .",
    "the rotation subgroup of @xmath7 transforms the kinematical variables @xmath3 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 among the inertial observers , and the local rotation subgroup @xmath8 only affects to the local change of the particle frame , i.e. , to the orientation variables @xmath13 . because the weyl group has no central extensions @xcite , in the quantum representation the symmetry group becomes @xmath20 .",
    "the general structure of the lagrangian for a free dirac particle when written in terms of the kinematical variables and their @xmath1derivatives is @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , because of the homogeneity of @xmath27 in terms of the @xmath1derivatives of the kinematical variables .",
    "the spin is defined by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the zitterbewegung part of spin and @xmath30 is the rotational part as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : elec ] .",
    "the @xmath29 part is related to the function @xmath31 , i.e. , to the dependence of the lagrangian on the acceleration @xmath32 . when quantizing the system the @xmath29 part of the spin quantizes with integer values while the spin @xmath33 is coming from the rotation part @xmath30 .",
    "it is this twofold structure of the spin which produces a clear interpretation of the gyromagnetic ratio because the particle current , which produces the magnetic moment , is only related to the zitterbewegung part of the spin @xmath29 , which is twice the total spin @xmath19 , as seen in @xcite .",
    "the casimir operators of the enlarged group @xmath9 are the absolute value of the spin @xmath34 , which is the casimir operator of the weyl group @xmath6 and the absolute value @xmath35 of the spin projection operator on the body frame of the rotational part of the spin @xmath36 which corresponds to the casimir operator of the @xmath8 part . here",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 represent the three unit vectors of the local frame attached to the point @xmath3 .",
    "a dirac particle , with the enlarged group @xmath9 as its kinematical group , has as intrinsic properties the spin @xmath34 and the spin projection @xmath35 which take both the eigenvalue @xmath33 when quantized @xcite . when quantizing the system only two kinds of dirac particles arise according to the eigenvalues of the @xmath39 part of the spin , which can take the values 0 or 1 .",
    "the mass of the particle , very well defined as usual by means of the casimir operator of the poincar group @xmath40 , and which must be different from zero in order to properly define the casimir operator @xmath41 , is no longer an intrinsic property of a dirac particle , because this operator does not commute with the generator @xmath42 of space time dilations .",
    "mass , at this stage with a larger spacetime symmetry group , represents a property associated with the different states of the dirac particle .",
    "it could mean , for instance , that the electron and a massive neutrino are two different states of the same particle , the lepton .",
    "it is shown that the dynamical equation of point @xmath3 for the free particle and in the centre - of - mass frame is given by @xmath43 and where the spin vector @xmath19 is constant in this frame , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : elec ] . the average value of the position @xmath44 is the centre - of - mass position , which is zero in this frame .",
    "the average value of the velocity @xmath45 represents the centre - of - mass velocity , which is also zero in this frame .",
    "the radius of the zitterbewegung motion is @xmath17 , which becomes @xmath46 , when quantized , i.e. , half compton s wavelength .",
    "this dynamical equation ( [ eq : dyq ] ) is independent of the particular free lagrangian we take provided the kinematical variables remain the same as the ones quoted here .",
    "an elementary particle can be annihilated by the interaction with the corresponding antiparticle , but if it is not destroyed , we made the assumption that the structure of an elementary particle is not modified by any interaction so that its intrinsic properties , the spin @xmath34 and the spin projection on the body frame @xmath35 can not be altered by the interaction with an external field or by the presence in its neigbourhood of any other particle .",
    "let us consider a compound system formed by two spinning particles with the same kind of kinematical variables .",
    "we shall use a subscript @xmath47 to distinguish the variables corresponding to each particle .",
    "then the kinematical space of the compound system is spanned by the variables @xmath48 .",
    "the lagrangian of the system will be written as @xmath49 where the @xmath50 , @xmath47 , are the free lagrangians of each particle and @xmath51 is the interaction lagrangian we are looking for .",
    "both @xmath50 are invariant under the enlarged group @xmath9 and we are going to find an interaction lagrangian @xmath51 also invariant under @xmath9 .",
    "the general structure of the free lagrangian @xmath50 of each particle , which only depends on the corresponding kinematical variables of particle @xmath52 , is @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , because of the homogeneity of each @xmath50 in terms of the @xmath1derivatives of the corresponding kinematical variables .",
    "the spin and the spin projection on the body frame for each particle , are @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath38 are three orthogonal unit vectors with origin at point @xmath61 .",
    "the interaction lagrangian between these two particles @xmath51 will be in general a function of the kinematical variables of both particles and of their @xmath1derivatives . if both intrinsic properties @xmath62 and @xmath63 of each particle are not modified by any interaction then the interaction lagrangian can not be a function of the derivatives of the kinematical variables @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath47 .",
    "otherwise the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 will be different than in the free case . in this case the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which give rise to the definition of the spin , are obtained only from the corresponding free lagrangian @xmath50 .",
    "then , as far as the @xmath1derivatives of the kinematical variables are concerned , the interaction lagrangian @xmath51 will only depend on the variables @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath47 .",
    "in addition to this , it will also be a function of the kinematical variables @xmath71 , @xmath61 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , but not of @xmath74 because of the invariance under the local rotation group @xmath8 .",
    "spacetime dilation invariance implies that the lagrangian is a function of the phase difference @xmath75 , and of @xmath76 , but being both phases completely arbitrary and independent of each other it means that must be independent of these variables .",
    "because of the constraint @xmath77 , the interaction lagrangian will thus be finally a function @xmath78 and a homogeneous function of first degree of the derivatives @xmath79 , @xmath47 .",
    "if we call as usual the minkowski four - vector @xmath80 , translation invariance implies that the lagrangian must be a function of @xmath81 .",
    "the following two terms @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is minkowski s metric tensor , are poincar invariant .",
    "if we consider that the evolution parameter @xmath0 is dimensionless , these terms have both dimensions of length squared .",
    "it therefore implies that its quotient is dimensionless and therefore invariant under spacetime dilations .",
    "another requirement is that the lagrangian is necesarilly a homogeneous function of first degree in the @xmath1derivatives of the kinematical variables .",
    "the squared root will do the job . an additional discrete symmetry will be assumed because when the two particles are the same , and therefore indistinguishable , the interaction lagrangian must be invariant under the interchange @xmath85 between the labels of the two particles .",
    "we thus arrive at the @xmath9 group invariant lagrangian @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a coupling constant .",
    "this lagrangian describes an interaction which is scale invariant and thus it is valid as a long and short range interaction and which has a coulomb - like behaviour when the spin is supressed , as we shall see in the next section . in this way it suplies a kind of generalization of an action at a distance electromagnetic interaction between spinning particles .",
    "alternative lagrangians which fulfil the requirements of invariance and homogeneity can be constructed .",
    "for instance , @xmath88 , but this one is a total @xmath1derivative of the function @xmath89 . another could be @xmath90 , also dimensionless and linear in the derivatives of the kinematical variables , but it reverses its sign under the interchange @xmath85 , and thus all interaction observables , like the interaction energy are reversed , which is physically meaningless for two alike particles .",
    "the interaction lagrangians @xmath91 and @xmath92 also fulfil the requirements of being invariant under the enlarged group @xmath9 , homogeneous of first degree in the derivatives of the kinematical variables , and invariant under the interchange of the particle labels , but they do not have a coulomb - like limit when the spin is smeared out .",
    "they will not be considered here and the analysis of the interaction they describe is left to a subsequent research . perhaps many other lagrangians could be guessed according to the above requirements but we have not succeded in finding another one with such a desirable coulomb - like behaviour .",
    "the interaction between two dirac particles is not unique .",
    "we know that among leptons and quarks there are at least , short range interactions like the weak and strong interactions and a short and long range one like the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the novelty is that this classical interaction lagrangian , which possesses a coulomb limit , describes the interaction between two spinning particles , which satisfy dirac s equation when quantized , and has been obtained by assuming a spacetime symmetry group larger than the poincar group .",
    "once an inertial observer is fixed we shall consider a synchronous time description , i.e. to use as evolution parameter the own observer s time @xmath10 which is the same as the two time variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath95 , @xmath96 , and thus @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the instantaneous separation between the corresponding charges in this frame and @xmath99 the velocity of the charge of particle @xmath52 .",
    "an average over the charge position and velocity in the centre - of - mass of particle 1 implies that @xmath100 and @xmath101 , so that the interaction becomes the instantaneous coulomb interaction , between the centre - of - mass of the first particle and the charge position of the other .",
    "the average over the other then corresponds to the instantaneous coulomb interaction of two spinless point particles because when neglecting the zitterbewegung we are suppressing the spin structure .",
    "it is suggesting that @xmath102 in terms of the electric charge of each particle and where the @xmath103 sign depends on the kind of particles either of opposite or equal charge .",
    "the dynamical equation of a free dirac particle and for any inertial observer is a fourth - order differential equation for the position of the charge @xmath3 which can be separated into a system of coupled second order differential equations for the centre - of - mass @xmath4 and centre - of - charge @xmath3 in the form:@xcite @xmath104 where now the dot means time derivative .",
    "the first equation represents the free motion of the centre - of - mass and the second a kind of relativistic harmonic oscillation of point @xmath3 around point @xmath4 which preserves the constant absolute value @xmath105 of the velocity @xmath106 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath107 , @xmath108 and the equation is just the harmonic motion @xmath109 , of point @xmath3 around @xmath4 .",
    "the factor @xmath110 prevents that when we take the boundary value @xmath111 , the solution does not modify this absolute value of the velocity of the charge .    in the case of interaction this second equation remains the same because it corresponds to the definition of the centre - of - mass position which is unchanged by the interaction , because it only involves the @xmath31 and @xmath30 functions .",
    "the first equation for particle @xmath52 is going to be replaced by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the corresponding linear momentum of each particle expressed as usual in terms of the centre - of - mass velocity @xmath114 and the force @xmath115 is computed from the interaction lagrangian ( [ eq : li ] ) @xmath116 for particle @xmath117 it takes the form : @xmath118 where it contains velocity terms which behave like @xmath119 and acceleration terms which go as @xmath120 in terms of the separation of the charges @xmath98 . in this new notation @xmath121 .",
    "then the system of second order differential equations to be solved are @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the fine structure constant once all the variables are taken dimensionless . for that",
    ", we take the space scale factor @xmath124 and the time scale as @xmath125 .",
    "all terms of equation ( [ eq : q2 ] ) which depend on the acceleration of the charges have to be replaced by the expressions of ( [ eq : r2 ] ) .",
    "it would be desirable to find analytical solutions of the above equations ( [ eq : q2]-[eq : r2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless we have not succeded in finding such a goal .",
    "however we shall analyse different solutions obtained by numerical integration .",
    "we are going to use the computer program dynamics solver @xcite .",
    "the quality of the numerical results is tested by using the different integration schemes this program allows , ranging from the very stable embedded runge - kutta code of eighth order , due to dormand and prince , to very fast extrapolation routines .",
    "all codes have adaptive step size control and we check that smaller tolerances do not change the results .",
    "another advantage is that it can be prepared to analyse solutions corresponding to a wide range of boundary conditions , automatically .",
    "see in figure [ fig : scat ] the scattering of two equal charged particles with parallel spins .",
    "the centre - of - mass motion of each particle is depicted with an arrow . if the two particles do not approach each other too much these trajectories correspond basically to the trajectories of two spinless point particles interacting through an instantaneous coulomb force . by too much we mean that their relative separation between the corresponding centres of mass is always much greater than compton s wavelength .",
    "this can be understood because of the above discussion about the coulomb behaviour of the averaged interaction lagrangian , if the average position of each charge is far from the other . for high energy interaction",
    "the two particles approach each other below that separation and therefore the average analysis no longer works because the charges approach each other to very small distances where the interaction term and the exact position of both charges , becomes important . in this case",
    "new phenomena appear .",
    "we can have , for instance , a forward scattering like the one depicted on figure [ fig : forw ] , which is not described in the classical spinless case , or even the formation of bound pairs for particles of the same charge , which we shall analyse in what follows .        in figure",
    "[ fig : phase ] we represent an initial situation for two equal charged particles with parallel spins such that the corresponding centres of mass are separated by a distance below compton s wavelength .",
    "remember that the radius of the internal motion is half compton s wavelength .",
    "we locate the charge labels @xmath126 at the corresponding points @xmath61 and the corresponding mass labels @xmath127 to the respective centre - of - mass @xmath128 .",
    "we depict in part ( a ) the situation when the two particles have the same phase @xmath129 .",
    "the forces @xmath115 , on each particle @xmath47 , are computed in terms of the positions , velocities and accelerations of both charges , according to ( [ eq : f ] ) , and are also depicted on the corresponding centres of mass as a consequence of the structure of the equations ( [ eq : q2 ] ) .",
    "we see that a repulsive force between the charges produces also a repulsive force between the centres of mass in this situation . however , in part ( b ) both charges have opposite phases @xmath130 , and now the repulsive force between the charges implies an attractive force between the corresponding centres of mass . if the initial situation is such that the centres - of - mass separation are greater than compton s wavelength , the force is always repulsive irrespective of the internal phases of the particles .        in figure",
    "[ fig : phasel ] we have another situation of opposite phases and where the initial separation between the centres of mass is larger but still smaller than compton s wavelength .",
    "to analyse this situation , which is going to produce bound motions , we proceed as follows : we start the numerical integration by imposing the boundary condition that both centres of mass are at rest and located at the origin of the reference frame @xmath131 . for particle 2",
    "we take the initial phase @xmath132 and for @xmath133 we start with @xmath134 and , will be increased step by step in one degree in the automatic process , up to reach the whole range of @xmath135 radians .",
    "the boundary values of the variables @xmath136 and @xmath137 , with the constraint @xmath138 , are taken as the corresponding values compatible with these phases .",
    "the whole system is analysed in its centre - of - mass frame , so that for subsequent boundary values these variables are restricted to @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the automatic integration is performed in such a way that when the two particles separate , i.e. , when their centre - of - mass separation is above compton s wavelength , the integration stops and starts again with a new boundary value of the phase @xmath141 of one degree more , and the new values of the variables @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "if the two particles do not separate we wait until the integration time corresponds to @xmath142 turns of the charges around their corresponding centre - of - mass , stop the process , keep record of the phases and initial velocities , and start again with new boundary values .",
    "this corresponds , in the case of electrons , to a bound state leaving during a time greater than @xmath143 seconds . for some particular boundary values , with opposite phases , we have left the program working during a whole week and the bound state prevails .",
    "this represents a time of life of the bound state greater than @xmath144 seconds . leaving the computation program running for a year",
    "will only increase this lower bound in two orders of magnitude .",
    "the general feeling is that the bound states are sufficiently stable , because even the possible numerical integration errors do not destroy the stability .",
    "this process is repeated again and again by changing slightly the initial values of the centre - of - mass variables @xmath145 and @xmath146 , in steps of @xmath147 in these dimensionless units and with @xmath132 , and the same procedure with @xmath141 , as above . to test the acuracy of the integration method",
    ", we check every @xmath148 integration steps that the velocities of the charges of both particles remain of absolute value 1 , within a numerical error smaller than @xmath149 .",
    "the whole process is repeated by changing the initial @xmath150 phase to any other arbitrary value .",
    "we are interested to see whether different results are produced depending on the values of the phase difference @xmath151 and of the centre - of - mass variables @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "we collect all data which produce bound motions , and find the following results :    1 .",
    "the initial velocity of their centres of mass must be @xmath152 .",
    "otherwise the bound motion is not stable and the two particles , after a few turns , go off .",
    "2 .   for each velocity @xmath152",
    "there is a range @xmath153 of the pase @xmath154 for which the bound motion is stable .",
    "the greater the centre - of - mass velocity of each particle the narrower this range , so that the bound motion is more likely when the phases are opposite to each other .",
    "we have found bound motions for an initial separation between the centres of mass up to @xmath155 times compton s wavelength , like the one depicted in figure [ fig : phasel ] , provided the above phases and velocities are kept within the mentioned ranges .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bound ] we show the bound motion of both particles when their centres of mass are initially separated @xmath156compton s wavelength , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "now the force between the charges is repulsive but nevertheless , if the internal phases @xmath133 and @xmath161 are opposite to each other , it becomes an atractive force between their centres of mass in accordance to the mechanism shown in figure [ fig : phase ] ( b ) .",
    "this possibility of formation of low energy metastable bound pairs of particles of the same charge is not peculiar of this interaction lagrangian . by using the electromagnetic interaction or even the instantaneous coulomb interaction between the charges of two spinning dirac particles we found in @xcite also this behaviour .",
    "this bound motion is not destroyed by external electric fields and also by an external magnetic field along the spin direction .",
    "nevertheless , a transversal magnetic field destroys this bound pair system .",
    "when we make the average of the position @xmath61 it becomes the centre - of - mass @xmath128 and the repulsive force between the charges is also a repulsive force between the corresponding centres of mass and therefore when we suppress the zitterbewegung spin content of the particles there is no possibility of formation of bound pairs .",
    "although this result produces a classical mechanism for the formation of a spin 1 bound system from two equal charged fermions we must be careful about its conclusions .",
    "first , it is a classical description and although the range of energies which produce this phenomenon is a wide one it does not mean that two electrons can reach that binding energy .",
    "this dirac particle is a system of seven degrees of freedom : 3 represent the position @xmath3 , another 3 the orientation @xmath13 and finally the phase @xmath14 .",
    "if we accept the equipartition theorem for the energy , then for the maximum kinetic energy which produces a bound motion @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath164 the maximum velocity of the center of mass of each particle , then it means that a gas of polarized electrons ( like the conducting electrons in a quantum hall effect ) could form bound states up to a temperature below @xmath165k , which is a very high temperature . in a second place ,",
    "matter at this level behaves according to quantum mechanical rules and therefore we must solve the corresponding quantum mechanical bound state to establish the proper energies and angular momenta at which these bound states would be stationary .",
    "this problem has not been solved yet , but the existence of this classical possibility of formation of bound pairs justifies an effort in this direction . if the phases of the two particles are the same ( or almost the same ) there is no possibility of formation of a bound state .",
    "the two fermions of the bound state have the same spin and energy .",
    "they differ that their phases and linear momenta are opposite to each other .",
    "is this difference in the phase a way to overcome at the classical level , the pauli exclusion principle ?",
