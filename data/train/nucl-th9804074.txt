    "first , the continuum s.p.l . density following the subtraction of the free - gas contribution should be added to the particle - hole bound state density .",
    "the latter quantity has been used for the description of the multistep compound ( msc ) processes @xcite .",
    "it has been assumed to be zero outside the nuclear well , which is now considered less appropriate @xcite .",
    "second , in the opinion of bogila _ et al .",

    "densities which determine the psds including the continuum effect [ figs .",

    "9(a ) and 9(c ) ] . the reasons for deviations from the psd general trend , for the two main additional classes of particle - hole state densities with variant characteristics are outlined in this way .",
    "thus , the average excitation energies , limited by the value @xmath9 for the excited particles , entirely determine the s.p.l .",
    "densities for the particle - hole bound state densities .",
    "actually one may note that @xmath110 has a rather constant value in this case .",
    "the value of @xmath111 is similarly constant but obviously lower in the latter case , i.e. of the bound and continuum state density including the continuum effect .",
    "however , the above - discussed aspect of @xmath110 is the key quantity for the second class of modified psds .",
    "moreover , these two classes of psds with various restrictions [ figs . 10(a ) and 10(b ) ] are at the same time compared with the predictions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:23 ] ) and ( [ eq:24 ] ) including only the finite - depth correction , also shown in fig .",
    "a few configurations significant in pe calculations are used in this respect . the ratios of each of the two variant psds to the general psd values given in fig .",
    "10(b ) are further shown in figs .",
    "10(c ) and 10(d ) .",
    "it follows that at medium energies the size of the continuum effect on the psd values , which is given by the latter class of ratios , is rather similar to that for the bound - state condition .",
    "therefore , a possible replacement within msc calculations of the particle - hole bound state density by the psd corrected for the continuum effect @xcite would not be trivial .",
    "a similar point may concern the use within the msd calculations of the psd either including the continuum effect @xcite or taking into account the free - gas single particle levels as well .",
    "the relation between the results of eq . ( [ eq:25 ] ) and the quantum - mechanical ( qm ) calculations should be also considered before further use of the former in reaction calculations .",
    "hence , following shlomo _",
    "@xcite , the s.p.l .",
    "density was calculated @xcite by using the respective relation with green s function . as an alternative to the smearing procedure",
    ", the imaginary part of green s function has been calculated separately for the discrete and continuous states .",
    "the regular and jost solutions of the radial schrdinger equation are used in the continuum . the smooth part of the rapidly fluctuating s.p.l .",
    "density is calculated by means of the strutinski smoothing procedure @xcite .",
    "the woods - saxon ( ws ) potential @xcite was considered in this frame as well as in the semiclassical thomas - fermi ( tf ) formula , with the similar results shown in fig .",
    "the familiar fgm shape is given by the tf formula with an infinite square - well ( sq ) potential , while the corresponding finite well ( fsq ) illustrates the continuum effect in fig .",
    "it should be noted that the continuum component of the s.p.l .",
    "density is nearly the same within either exact quantum - mechanical calculations with the ws potential , or tf approximation with either the ws or the fsq potential wells , provided that the free - gas contribution is subtracted .",
    "moreover , a similar trend is obtained by means of the simple fgm formula ( [ eq:25 ] ) taking into account the continuum effect .",
    "nevertheless , the quantum - mechanical s.p.l . density can be related to this formula only for a reduced fermi energy , e.g. @xmath112 mev @xcite .",
    "this value has been obtained as an average value along the trajectory of the incident projectile with respect to the both nuclear density and first nucleon - nucleon collision probability .",
    "the usual value @xmath3=38 mev causes lower @xmath113 values , that are not consistent with the phenomenological data .    therefore one may use the simple fgm energy dependence , within an appropriate form which matches the quantum - mechanical s.p.l .",
    "density including the continuum effect , in the average energy - dependent esm formalism .",
    "this unsophisticated yet improved method could provide the correct psds for msd / msc calculations , in agreement with the consideration that the highly - excited single - particle states are not strongly coupled to compound nuclear states @xcite or partially relaxed states of composite nuclei formed in nuclear reactions at intermediate energies @xcite . the question is additionally made intricate by the recent proof of a much shorter time scale required to reach thermal equilibration in intermediate - energy nucleon - induced reactions , found to be of the order of @xmath11410@xmath115 sec @xcite .",
    "further experimental - data analyses should thus consider a combination of reaction models and related psd formalisms as well .",
    "the particle - hole state density has been obtained by means of recursive relations , for the bound as well as bound - plus - continuum states .",
    "the corresponding expressions , i.e. , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:17 ] ) , can be used for various energy dependences of the excited - particle and hole state densities while the particular case of the fgm is discussed .",
    "we have underlined that consideration of the finite depth of the nuclear - potential well should be explicitly present in the particle - hole state density formulas exceeding the esm framework .    next , the results of the recursive formula are compared with the kalbach @xcite approximation still within the esm formula but using distinct average s.p.l",
    ". densities for the holes and excited particles respectively , at their average excitation energies . at the same time",
    "the kalbach formalism is extended to the case of the bound states , while the pairing and pauli - blocking effects have been included in all terms of the esm correction function .",
    "the correctness of the average energy - dependent esm approach is established by reference to the rigorous convolution ( [ eq:9 ] ) of the energy - dependent s.p.l .",
    "densities for the case of the fgm dependence .",
    "the difference between the predictions of the two methods is compared with the similar variation between average energy - dependent form and the standard formula @xcite , the former being much lower especially in the bound - state case .",
    "the exact calculation of the pauli - blocking effect , which is close to the well - known approximate pauli correction @xcite , is also discussed .",
    "thus it is shown on a common basis the higher importance of the s.p.l .- density energy dependence versus the exact calculation of the pauli correction .",
    "the significant role of the pairing correction is pointed out , while comments are made on the circumstances under which the adequate account of the pairing effects could indeed appear less than essential @xcite .",
    "the continuum effect has been considered for the case of a fgm energy dependence in the average energy - dependent esm approach .",
    "the continuum component of the s.p.l .",
    "density is found rather similar using either exact quantum - mechanical calculations with the woods - saxon potential , or thomas - fermi approximation with ws as well as finite - square potential wells , provided that the free - gas contribution is subtracted .",
    "a similar trend is obtained by means of the simple fgm formula for the s.p.l .",
    "density if the continuum effect is taken into account .",
