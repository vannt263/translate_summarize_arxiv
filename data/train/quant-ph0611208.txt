    "the theoretical description of relaxation and decoherence processes in open quantum systems often leads to a non - markovian dynamics which is determined by pronounced memory effects @xcite .",
    "strong system - environment couplings @xcite , correlations and entanglement in the initial state @xcite , interactions with environments at low temperatures and with spin baths @xcite , finite reservoirs @xcite , and transport processes in nano - structures @xcite can lead to long memory times and to a failure of the markovian approximation .",
    "a systematic approach to non - markovian dynamics is provided by the projection operator techniques @xcite which are extensively used in nonequilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "these techniques are based on the introduction of a certain projection superoperator @xmath0 which acts on the states of the total system .",
    "the superoperator @xmath0 is the mathematical expression for the idea of the elimination of degrees of freedom from the complete description of the states of the total system : if @xmath1 is the full density matrix of the composite system , the projection @xmath2 represents a certain approximation of @xmath1 which leads to a simplified effective description of the dynamics through a reduced set of variables .",
    "the projection @xmath2 is therefore referred to as the relevant part of the density matrix .    with the help of the projection operator techniques",
    "one derives closed dynamic equations for the relevant part of the density matrix .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath2 can either be the nakajima - zwanzig equation @xcite , an integrodifferential equation with a retarded memory kernel , or else the time - convolutionless master equation , which is a time - local differential equation of first order involving a time - dependent generator @xcite . in most cases these equations",
    "are used as starting point for the derivation of effective master equations through a systematic perturbation expansion with respect to the strength of the system - environment coupling .    in the standard approach to the dynamics of open systems",
    "one chooses a projection superoperator which is defined by the expression @xmath3 , where @xmath4 represents the reduced density matrix of the open system , @xmath5 denoting the trace over the environmental hilbert space , and @xmath6 is some fixed environmental state .",
    "a superoperator of this form projects the total state @xmath1 onto a tensor product state , i.  e. , onto a state without any statistical correlations between system and environment .",
    "we emphasize that this ansatz does _ not _ imply ( as is sometimes claimed ) that one completely ignores all system - environment correlations .",
    "it only presupposes that all correlations which are present in the initial state or are generated during the time - evolution can be treated as perturbations within the framework of the projection operator techniques .",
    "the projection onto a tensor product state is widely used in studies of open quantum systems .",
    "it is often applicable in the case of weak system - environment couplings .",
    "usually , the perturbation expansion is restricted to the second order ( known as born approximation ) , from which one derives , with the help of certain further assumptions , a markovian quantum master equations in lindblad form @xcite . in this paper",
    "the quantum dynamics of an open system is said to be non - markovian if the time - evolution of its reduced density matrix can not be described ( to the desired degree of accuracy ) by means of a closed master equation with a time - independent generator in lindblad form .    a possible approach to large deviations from markovian behavior consists in carrying out the perturbation expansion to higher orders in the system - environment coupling (",
    "several examples are discussed in ref .",
    "however , this approach is often limited by the increasing complexity of the resulting equations of motion . moreover",
    ", the perturbation expansion may not converge uniformly in time , such that higher orders only improve the quality of the approximation of the short - time behavior , but completely fail in the long - time limit @xcite .",
    "there is however a further promising strategy : to treat highly non - markovian processes in a more efficient way one can replace the tensor product state used in the standard born approximation by a certain correlated system - environment state .",
    "this approach has been proposed by esposito and gaspard @xcite and by budini @xcite to derive effective master equations within second order perturbation theory that describe strong non - markovian effects .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that this idea can be formulated in terms of a positive projection superoperator @xmath0 which projects any state onto a correlated system - environment state , i.  e. , onto a state that contains statistical correlations between certain system and environment states .",
    "this formulation allows an immediate application of the projection operator techniques to correlated system - environment states , and to carry out the perturbation expansion to higher orders in a systematic way .",
    "an example is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the master equations of second and of fourth order corresponding to a correlated projection superoperator have been constructed .",
    "the application of a correlated projection superoperator implies that the relevant part @xmath2 can no longer be expressed in terms of the reduced density matrix alone .",
    "hence , employing a correlated projection superoperator one enlarges the set of relevant variables to capture those statistical correlations that are responsible for strong non - markovian effects .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss this idea of using correlated projection superoperators in the analysis of non - markovian dynamics . on the basis of certain general physical conditions we derive in sec .",
    "[ sec - cps ] a representation theorem for a class of correlated projection superoperators that are appropriate for the application of the projection operator techniques .",
    "a central problem of the theory of non - markovian processes is the formulation of appropriate master equations that preserve the normalization and the positivity of the density matrix ( see , e.  g. , the discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in sec .",

    "a natural minimal requirement is therefore that for any physical state @xmath1 the projection @xmath2 is again a physical state , i.  e. , a positive operator with unit trace .",

    "( [ itimeslambda ] ) is that @xmath0 maps separable ( classically correlated ) states to separable states , which means that the projection does not create entanglement between system and environment .",

    "thus , @xmath2 contains the full information needed to reconstruct the reduced system s state .",

    "these terms express a pronounced memory effect : they imply that the dynamics never forgets its initial condition , i.  e. , that the process is governed by an infinite memory time .",
    "a further remarkable feature of eq .",

    "( [ gen - master ] ) by taking @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "a master equation of the general form ( [ gen - master ] ) has been derived recently by budini @xcite .",
    "this author suggests introducing an extra degree of freedom @xmath193 which modulates the interaction between the reduced system @xmath7 and its environment @xmath8 . under the assumptions that @xmath8 may be treated as a markovian reservoir and that the dynamics of the populations decouples from the dynamics of the coherences of @xmath193 , one arrives at the master equation ( [ gen - master ] ) . in a certain sense",
    "the introduction of an additional degree of freedom @xmath193 corresponds to the extended state space @xmath123 used in sec .",
    "[ structure ] to construct the embedding into a lindblad dynamics .",
    "an advantage of the present formulation is that it avoids the use of a microscopic model for the extra degree of freedom and that it clearly shows the basic physical condition underlying the master equation ( [ gen - master ] ) : this condition is the existence of an effective representation of the dynamics through a projection onto separable , classically correlated quantum states .    what are the physical conditions under which the use of a standard projection onto a tensor product state is not sufficient to correctly describe the reduced system s dynamics for a given system - environment model ?",
    "while this important question seems to be difficult to answer in full generality and certainly deserves further investigations , important hints can be obtained already by an investigation of the time - convolutionless perturbation expansion @xcite .",
    "if the two - point environmental correlation functions do not decay rapidly in time the second order of the expansion can not , of course , be expected to give an accurate description of the dynamics .",
    "for instance , this situation arises for the spin star model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the second - order generator of the master equation increases linearly with time such that the born - markov approximation simply does not exist . the example investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that there are even cases in which the standard markov condition is satisfied although the product - state projection completely fails if one truncates the expansion at any finite order . in such cases strong non - markovian dynamics",
    "is induced through the behavior of higher - order correlation functions .",
    "hence , one can judge the quality of a given projection superoperator only by an investigation of the structure of higher orders of the expansion .",
    "the standard projection and the corresponding lindblad equation are not reliable if higher orders lead to contributions that are not bounded in time , signifying the non - uniform convergence of the perturbation expansion @xcite .",
    "for many physical models one knows certain quantities @xmath194 which are exactly ( or at least approximately ) conserved under the time - evolution . a great advantage of the formulation by means of the master equation ( [ gen - master ] )",
    "is that it allows the implementation of the corresponding conservation laws .",
    "for instance , the master equation derived in ref .",
    "@xcite reflects the conservation of the ( uncoupled ) total system energy .    to formulate the conservation of @xmath194 one chooses the operators @xmath46 in such a way that @xmath194 is a relevant observable",
    "[ see sec .",

    "( [ o - rel ] ) this means that @xmath194 can be written in the form @xmath195 then we have the exact relation @xmath196 hence , we can express the conservation of @xmath194 on the level of the master equation by means of the conservation law @xmath197 by use of the master equation ( [ gen - master ] ) this yields a relation between the operators @xmath130 and @xmath131 : @xmath198 + \\sum_{j \\lambda }   \\left ( r^{ji\\dagger}_{\\lambda } c^j_s r^{ji}_{\\lambda }   - \\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\ { r^{ji\\dagger}_{\\lambda } r^{ji}_{\\lambda } ,   c^i_s \\right\\ } \\right ) = 0.\\ ] ] thus , known conserved quantities lead to constraints on the choice of the operators that enter the master equation .",
    "an example is given by the quantity @xmath199 which counts the total number of excitations for the model discussed in sec .",
    "[ examples ] .",
    "this quantity is exactly conserved under the evolution generated by the hamiltonian ( [ h - model ] ) .",
    "writing @xmath200 we see that @xmath194 is indeed a relevant observable for the projection ( [ newprojection ] ) , i.  e. , we have @xmath201 .",
    "the corresponding conservation law takes the form @xmath202 this fact can be used to motivate the projection superoperator : with the choice of eq .",
    "( [ newprojection ] ) one ensures that the projection superoperator leaves invariant the conserved quantity and that the effective description respects the corresponding conservation law .",
    "we have discussed the theoretical description of non - markovian quantum dynamics within the framework of the projection operator techniques .",
    "it has been shown that an efficient modelling of strong non - markovian effects is made possible through the use of correlated projection superoperators @xmath0 that take into account statistical correlations between the open system and its environment .",
    "we have formulated and explained some general physical conditions which demand , essentially , that @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of a projective quantum channel that operates on the environmental variables .",
    "on the basis of these conditions a representation theorem for correlated projection operators [ eq .  ( [ projection - genform ] ) ] has been derived .    employing a correlated projection superoperator instead of the usual projection onto a tensor product state ,",
    "one enlarges the set of dynamical variables from the reduced density matrix @xmath16 to a collection of densities @xmath78 describing system states that are correlated with certain environmental states . by means of an embedding of the non - markovian dynamics into a lindblad dynamics on a suitably extended state space",
    ", we have derived the general structure of a master equation [ eq .  ( [ gen - master ] ) ] which governs the dynamics of the @xmath78 and models strong non - markovian effects , while preserving the physical conditions of normalization and positivity .",
    "a particularly important feature of the master equation is that it is able to describe very long and even infinite memory times , as well as large correlations in the initial state .",
    "we have also discussed the role of known conserved quantities .",
    "such quantities may be helpful to find an appropriate projection superoperator by demanding that they be relevant observables for @xmath0 .",
    "once this has been achieved one can express the corresponding conservation laws on the level of the effective description provided by the master equation .",
    "the semigroup assumption used in the derivation of the master equation ( [ gen - master ] ) is not really necessary .",
    "in fact , the present formulation can easily be extended to the case of an explicitly time - dependent lindblad generator on the extended state space .",
    "the resulting master equation is then again of the form of eq .",
    "( [ gen - master ] ) , where the operators @xmath203 and @xmath204 now depend explicitly on time .",
    "the result expressed by eq .",
    "( [ gen - master ] ) could be particularly useful for a phenomenological approach to non - markovian dynamics : for arbitrary @xmath130 and @xmath131 this equation represents a physically acceptable master equation because it preserves the normalization of the reduced density matrix and transforms positive initial components @xmath205 into positive components @xmath206 .",
    "we emphasize that the argument leading to the form ( [ gen - master ] ) of the master equations is non - perturbative .",
    "given a certain projection superoperator @xmath0 defining the densities @xmath78 , the only assumption entering the derivation is the existence of an embedding of the dynamics into a lindblad dynamics on the extended state space .",
    "the projection superoperators used for the description of non - markovian dynamics in sec .  [ dynamics ] have a special feature .",
    "namely , they project any given state onto a classically correlated state .",
    "if a non - markovian dynamics can be approximated by use of such a superoperator within low orders of the perturbation expansion , one can conclude that the true states of the total system can be represented effectively through classically correlated states and that genuine quantum correlations ( entanglement ) may be treated as perturbations . on the other hand , the representation theorem of sec .",
    "[ sec - representation ] includes the case of projection superoperators that project onto nonseparable ( entangled ) quantum states . for such superoperators",
    "the arguments that led to the master equation ( [ gen - master ] ) are not applicable .",
    "it remains an important open problem to extend the formulation developed here to the case of nonseparable projection superoperators .",
    "such an extension could enable a systematic investigation of the dynamical significance of genuine quantum correlations in non - markovian processes .",
