    "since @xmath37 has a @xmath35-bridge position with the hempel distance @xmath8 , it is a prime knot by the following :      let @xmath5 be an @xmath11-bridge position of a composite knot and @xmath9 be a bridge sphere of @xmath5 .",

    "however it seems difficult to find more than two locally minimal bridge positions of such a knot , and we would like to ask the following problem .",
    "it should be remarked that there exist only finitely many bridge positions of given bridge numbers for a hyperbolic knot ( @xcite ) . in particular , there are finitely many globally minimal bridge positions of a hyperbolic knot .",
    "it should be also remarked that multiple bridge surfaces restrict hempel distances ( @xcite ) .",
    "composite knots are a simple example of knots with essential surfaces properly embedded in the exteriors of their representatives . theorem [ composite ] suggests that essential surfaces restrict hempel distances .",
    "schleimer showed it in general .",
    "[ bound ] let @xmath139 be an orientable essential surface properly embedded in the exterior of a bridge position @xmath5 of a knot . then the hempel distance of @xmath5 is bounded above by twice the genus of @xmath139 plus @xmath140 .    by theorem",
    "[ bound ] , if a knot exterior contains an essential annulus or an essential torus , then the hempel distance of a bridge position is at most 2 .",
    "therefore , if there exists a bridge position of a knot with the hempel distance at least 3 , then the knot is hyperbolic .",
    "the properties of our knot @xmath37 can be compared with it .",
    "a knot without an essential surface with meridional boundary in the exterior of its representative is called a _ meridionally small knot_. for example , the trivial knot , 2-bridge knots and torus knots are known to be meridionally small . as we mentioned in section [ intro ] , these knots also have the nice property that any nonminimal bridge position is stabilized .",
    "we say that a knot is _ destabilizable _ if it has this property .",
    "zupan showed that any cabled knot @xmath141 of a meridionally small knot @xmath4 is also meridionally small , and that if @xmath4 is destabilizable , then @xmath141 is also destabilizable ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , the following problem is naturally proposed .          on the other hand , it is not always true that if the knot exterior contains an essential surface with meridional boundary , then a bridge position has hempel distance @xmath34 .",

    "* example 5.1 ) shows that a @xmath39-bridge position of @xmath142 has hempel distance greater than @xmath34 , but the knot exterior contains an essential surface with meridional boundary .",
    "theorem [ fundamental1 ] allows us to define a distance between two bridge positions of a knot , which we call the _",
    "birman distance_. that is to say , the birman distance between two bridge positions is the minimum number of type i moves and the inverse operations relating the bridge positions up to isotopy .",
    "for example , the birman distance between an @xmath11-bridge position and an @xmath138-bridge position of the trivial knot is always @xmath143 by theorem [ otal ] .",
    "the birman distance between @xmath36 and the @xmath39-bridge position of @xmath37 is at least @xmath39 since @xmath36 is locally minimal .",
    "in fact , we can see that it is at most @xmath144 by observing the @xmath40-rotation of @xmath36 .",
    "tomova gave an upper bound for the birman distance between two bridge positions with high hempel distance which are obtained from each other by flipping , namely the rotation of @xmath1 exchanging the poles .",

    "we remark that the @xmath10-bridge position is not locally minimal , and hence it does not answer problem [ question ] .",
