    "the excited states of atomic nuclei , especially those of light nuclei , show strong @xmath0 clustering , and many different types of @xmath0 cluster structure appear as the excitation energy increases @xcite .",
    "in particular , the linear - chain configuration of three @xmath0 particles ( linearly aligned three @xmath0 particles ) suggested by morinaga @xcite has long been an important and interesting subject because of its exotic structure and large deformation equivalent to hyperdeformation .",
    "the hoyle state ( @xmath13 state of @xmath9c ) was the first candidate of the linear chain , but later it turned out that it does not have the linear - chain configuration but are loosely coupled 3@xmath0 particles with dilute gas - like nature @xcite . in turn , the instability of the linear - chain configuration against the bending motion ( deviation from linear alignment ) was pointed out and the bent - armed configuration was predicted by the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite and fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the interest in the linear - chain state is reinforced by the unstable nuclear physics , because the addition of the valence neutrons will increase the stability of @xmath0 cluster structure by their glue - like role .",
    "for example , 2@xmath0 cluster structures of be isotopes are assisted by valence neutrons that are well described in terms of the molecular - orbits @xcite .",
    "naturally , we expect that the linear - chain configurations of 3@xmath0 clusters can be stabilized by the assist of valence neutrons in neutron - rich c isotopes .",
    "indeed , there are a number of studies to theoretically predict and experimentally search for the linear - chain states in neutron - rich carbon isotopes @xcite . among c isotopes",
    ", @xmath1c is very interesting and important nucleus as the most promising candidate of the stable linear - chain state , because its stability against the bending motion was pointed out by molecular - orbital model calculation @xcite . assuming 3@xmath0 cluster core and @xmath4 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 molecular - orbits of valence neutrons , it was shown that the linear - chain configuration with valence neutrons occuping @xmath16 molecular - orbits is stable .",
    "therefore , it is very important and interesting to investigate the linear - chain state in @xmath1c without a - priori assumption on the cluster core and valence neutron orbits .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the linear - chain configuration , triangular configurations of 3@xmath0 particles are also suggested in the neighbouring nuclei such as @xmath17c and @xmath18c @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is also interesting to search for analogous state in @xmath1c .    for this purpose , we discuss 3@xmath0 cluster states in @xmath1c based on amd which has been successfully applied to the studies of the clustering in unstable nuclei @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present study is two - fold .",
    "the first is to search for and show the linear - chain and other cluster states in @xmath1c without a - priori assumption on the structure and to test the stability against the bending motion .",
    "we will show that two different types of the 3@xmath0 cluster states exist , triangular and linear - chain configurations .",
    "it is also shown that the valence neutron orbits are qualitatively understood in terms of the molecular - orbits , and the linear - chain configuration is stable with the help of those valence neutrons .",
    "the second aim is to provide a quantitative and reliable prediction of their properties for the experimental survey .",
    "we predict the band - head states of the triangular and linear - chain bands at 8.0 and 15.5 mev , and the @xmath11 state of the linear - chain configuration becomes the yrast state at @xmath11 with @xmath12 mev owing to its very large moment of inertia comparable with hyperdeformation .",
    "the microscopic @xmath19-body hamiltonian used in this study is written as , @xmath20 where the gogny d1s interaction @xcite is used as an effective nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath21 and the coulomb interaction @xmath22 is approximated by a sum of seven gaussians .",
    "the center - of - mass kinetic energy @xmath23 is exactly removed .",
    "the intrinsic wave function @xmath24 of the system is represented by a slater determinant of single particle wave packets , and we employ the parity - projected wave function @xmath25 as the variational wave function , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the single particle wave packet which is a direct product of the deformed gaussian spatial part @xcite , spin ( @xmath28 ) and isospin ( @xmath29 ) parts , @xmath30 in this study , we focus on the positive - parity states of @xmath31 . the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are optimized by the variational calculation explained below . to investigate 3@xmath0 cluster states , we first perform the variational calculation with the constraint on the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath36 . in this calculation",
    ", we do not impose constraint on the parameter @xmath37 , and hence , thus - obtained wave functions have @xmath37 values that give the largest binding energies for given values of @xmath36 . as shown in the next section , we have obtained the linear - chain configuration located at @xmath38 as well as the triangular configuration .",
    "we performed another variational calculation to test its stability against bending motion ( deviation from the linear alignment of 3@xmath0 clusters ) .",
    "namely , starting from the above mentioned linear - chain configuration , we gradually increased the parameter @xmath37 keeping @xmath39 by applying the constraints on @xmath36 and @xmath37 simultaneously .",
    "this calculation generates the energy curve of the linear - chain configuration as function of @xmath37 .    after the variational calculation",
    ", the eigenstate of the total angular momentum @xmath40 is projected out from the wave functions @xmath41 obtained by variational calculations , @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the wigner @xmath44 function and @xmath45 is the rotation operator .",
    "the integrals over three euler angles @xmath46 are evaluated numerically .",
    "then , we perform the gcm calculation by employing the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath36 as the generator coordinate .",
    "the wave functions @xmath47 are superposed ,    @xmath48    where the coefficients @xmath49 and eigenenergies @xmath50 are obtained by solving the hill - wheeler equation @xcite , @xmath51 the wave functions @xmath52 that describe the ground and excited states of @xmath1c are called gcm wave function in the following .      to investigate the motion of the valence neutrons around the core nucleus , we calculate the neutron single - particle orbits of the intrinsic wave function .",
    "we first transform the single particle wave packet @xmath27 of each optimized intrinsic wave function @xmath24 to the orthonormalized basis , @xmath53 here , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the overlap matrix @xmath56 . using this basis ,",
    "the hartree - fock single particle hamiltonian is derived , @xmath57 the eigenvalues @xmath58 and eigenvectors @xmath59 of @xmath60 give the single particle energies and the single particle orbits , @xmath61 . to discuss the properties of the single particle levels",
    ", we also calculate the amount of the positive - parity component , @xmath62 and angular momenta in the intrinsic frame , @xmath63",
    "states as functions of quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath36 obtained by the angular momentum projection .",
    "filled symbols show the energy minimum states for given values of @xmath36 , while open symbols show local energy minima .",
    "there appears three different structures shown by circles , triangles and boxes ( see text ) .",
    "dashed lines show the thresholds energies for 1@xmath7 , @xmath65 and cluster decays . ]         and @xmath15 molecular orbits introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . if the system has axial symmetry and the effect of the spin - orbit interaction is negligible , these orbits are the eigenstates of @xmath66 and @xmath67 . ]",
    ".the properties of valence neutron orbits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] .",
    "each column show the single particle energy @xmath68 in mev , the amount of the positive - parity component @xmath69 and the angular momenta ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sp1])-([eq : sp3 ] ) ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the linear - chain configuration generates a rotational band built on the @xmath70 state at 15.5 mev , that is close to the @xmath8he+@xmath9be and @xmath10he+@xmath6be threshold energies . the band head state @xmath70 has the largest overlap with the basis wave function shown in fig.[fig : density ] ( e)(f ) which amounts to 0.92 , but the member states with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are fragmented into two states due to the coupling with other non - cluster basis wave functions .",
    "for example , the @xmath74 and @xmath75 states respectively have 0.30 and 0.65 overlaps with the basis wave function of fig.[fig : density ] ( e)(f ) . by averaging the excitation energies of the fragmented member states , the moment - of - inertia",
    "is estimated as @xmath76 kev .",
    "because of this strong deformation comparable with hyperdeformation , the member states has huge intra - band @xmath77 that is about several tens times as large as those in other bands . naturally , as the angular momentum increases , the excitation energy of the linear - chain state is lowered relative to other structures , and the @xmath11 member state at @xmath12 mev becomes the yrast state .",
    "different from the triangular band , the high - spin member states with @xmath78 are not fragmented and the band structure looks rather clear . since the excitation energy of the high - spin state with linear - chain configuration is relatively lower than others , the coupling with the non - cluster states and hence the fragmentation of the states may be hindered .",
    "thus , we predict the stable linear - chain configuration with molecular - orbits whose band - head energy is around @xmath8he+@xmath9be and @xmath10he+@xmath6be thresholds . owing to its large moment - of - inertia ,",
    "the @xmath11 member state becomes an yrast state .",
    "those suggest that the linear - chain band might be populated in the @xmath8he+@xmath9be and @xmath10he+@xmath6be reaction channels .",
    "we have studied 3@xmath0 cluster states of @xmath1c based on the amd calculations . by the variational calculation with the constraint on the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath36",
    ", it was found that two different 3@xmath0 cluster states appear depending on the magnitude of the deformation and the valence neutron configurations .",
    "the triangular configuration of 3@xmath0 clusters is accompanied by the valance neutrons in a @xmath79 configuration , while the linear - chain configuration has the valence neutrons with a @xmath3 configuration . from the analysis of the neutron single particle orbits ,",
    "it is shown that the valence neutron orbits of the linear - chain configuration is understood well in terms of molecular - orbits and it is qualitatively in good accordance with the @xmath16 configuration suggested by molecular - orbital model .",
    "we also pointed out parity asymmetry of the linear - chain configuration that originates in @xmath80+@xmath0+@xmath65 cluster nature .",
    "the gcm calculation demonstrated that the wave function of the linear - chain state is well confined within a region of small @xmath37 , and hence , it is stable against bending motion .",
    "we predict the presence of rotational bands associated with 3@xmath0 cluster states .",
    "in particular , the linear - chain band is built in the vicinity of the @xmath8he+@xmath9be and @xmath10he+@xmath6be thresholds energies , and the @xmath11 state becomes an yrast state .",
