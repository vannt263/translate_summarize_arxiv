    ", the phenomenon of transient linear amplification appears to be important @xcite .",
    "also known as non - modal amplification , transient amplification is a period of growth before the exponential decay sets in .",
    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for transient amplification is that the linear operator must not have a complete orthogonal set of eigenvectors .",
    "analysis of transient amplification has also been applied to plasma systems in which linear instability exists but transient linear behavior may be more important @xcite .    in the present work , we consider the phenomena of transient amplification and turbulence without instability for the case of the weakly - collisional plasma drift wave driven by a density gradient@xcite , neglecting toroidal effects .",
    "this oscillation has been called the `` universal instability '' as it was at first mistakenly thought to be linearly unstable in any plasma with a density gradient .",
    "the oscillation is electrostatic in nature , and linear instability can indeed be found in slab geometry without magnetic shear or temperature gradients .",
    "it was later established that when any amount of magnetic shear is included in the model , no matter how small , the eigenmodes become linearly damped for @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the perpendicular wavenumber and @xmath2 is the ion gyroradius @xcite .",
    "however , instability can persist at @xmath3 when the collisionality is very low @xcite .",
    "when both magnetic shear and modest collisions are included @xcite , the mode becomes linearly stable at all @xmath4 .",

    "specifically , in @xcite , considering the slab mode by setting curvature drift effects @xmath5 to 0 , the small - shear limit of ( 19 ) is different from the zero shear result ( 12 ) . )    the fluid version of this drift wave system was investigated in @xcite , using a model with three fluctuating quantities ( density , electrostatic potential , and parallel velocity ) . in this model",
    "all linear modes were damped , yet nonlinearly , turbulence could be sustained .",
    "it was pointed out that an important secondary instability in this system is a drift wave rotated by @xmath6 in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , since the stabilizing effects of magnetic shear are reduced in this orientation . in this",
    "rotated drift instability , the role of the equilibrium density gradient is replaced in a sense by the perturbed density gradient , the latter represented in the nonlinear term .",
    "however , since the nonlinearity is conservative , the rotated drift wave does not inject energy into the system in the way that can be done by a perturbation feeding off the density gradient of the equilibrium .",
    "several authors have also investigated transient linear effects in fluid drift wave models @xcite .",
    "however , these studies did not include magnetic shear , which we will find to have a very strong effect on transient behavior .    in the following sections , we establish three results concerning the drift wave system in slab geometry with magnetic shear , extending previous work by considering a kinetic description and exploring the role of transient linear amplification . for these studies ,",
    "the initial - value gyrokinetic code gs2 @xcite will be used for numerical computations .",
    "first , in section [ sec : transient ] we demonstrate that significant transient linear amplification is possible in this system , and that the transiently growing fluctuations resemble the zero - shear eigenmodes in the dependence of their instantaneous growth rate on wavenumber .",
    "second , in section [ sec : turbulence ] we demonstrate that universal - mode turbulence without linear instability , seen previously in the fluid model in @xcite , is also possible in the gyrokinetic model .",
    "finally , we prove there is a relationship between transient linear amplification and nonlinear turbulence in this system , using similar arguments to the proof for hydrodynamics in @xcite and arriving at similar conclusions .",

    "the growth rates and frequencies of this instability in the absence of magnetic shear are given in appendix [ appendix : zeroshear ] .",
    "as detailed in the appendix , some insight into the instability can be obtained by expanding the plasma dispersion function @xmath61 for the electrons in the small - argument limit , @xmath62 for @xmath63 , and by expanding the ion @xmath61 function in the large argument limit , @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "one then finds a frequency with positive imaginary part @xmath66 , indicating the instability is due to resonant electrons in the presence of a density gradient .",

    "amplification by several orders of magnitude is observed in all norms before exponential decay sets in .",

    "recall @xmath58 is a sum of positive contributions ( [ eq : wk ] ) from each 2d mode : @xmath118",
    ". therefore @xmath152 must be positive in the linear dynamics for at least one 2d mode , so this mode must be growing transiently in the @xmath58 norm .",
    "roughly speaking , the upshot of this argument is that we should not be surprised that there is transient amplification after the nonlinear term is turned off in figure ( [ fig : linearrestart ] ) .",
    "such amplification _ must _ occur .",
    "put another way , a necessary condition for turbulence ( in the absence of linear instability ) is that typical states of the turbulence can be transiently amplified .",
    "furthermore , the energy growth in the 2d modes that are amplified must be sufficient to balance the energy decay from the damped 2d modes .",
    "next , we present a second argument for the necessity of transient amplification .",
    "this argument is based on linear algebra and closely follows @xcite . for this second approach",
    ", we let @xmath153 denote a column vector that specifies the state of the system @xmath154 in some convenient basis . for example",
    ", @xmath153 could represent the array of values specifying the distribution function in a code .",
    "_ statement 2 : _ given a set of physical parameters for which the nonlinear gyrokinetic system ( [ eq : gke])-([eq : qn ] ) permits statistically steady turbulence , there exists at least one state @xmath155 such that ( 1 ) @xmath149 if @xmath156 , and ( 2 ) the squared projection of the turbulent state @xmath157 onto @xmath155 , defined below , has a non - zero average .    _",
    "proof : _ let @xmath158 denote the time - independent linear operator associated with ( [ eq : gke])-([eq : qn ] ) in the absence of the nonlinear term , so the linearized ( [ eq : gke])-([eq : qn ] ) can be written @xmath159 ( here we will take @xmath158 to be real since the equations ( [ eq : gke])-([eq : qn ] ) are real , though the following argument may be generalized to complex @xmath158 by replacing the transpose operation with hermitian conjugation . ) also let @xmath160 be the time - independent operator that defines the free energy norm : @xmath161 where @xmath162 denotes the transpose .",
    "note that @xmath160 is real and symmetric ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "differentiating ( [ eq : heh ] ) , @xmath164 { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ h$}},\\ ] ] which is equivalent to ( [ eq : dwdt ] ) .",
    "as discussed previously , the presence of the nonlinear term does not alter ( [ eq : dwdt ] ) ( since the nonlinear term is annihilated in the integration over the perpendicular directions @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) , so ( [ eq : dwdt2 ] ) holds for both the linear and nonlinear gyrokinetic equations . introducing a time average @xmath167 over statistically steady turbulence , then @xmath168 { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ h$ } } \\right > = 0.\\ ] ]    next , observe that the operator @xmath169 in ( [ eq : dwdt2])-([eq : avg ] ) is real and symmetric , so it possesses a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors with real eigenvalues .",
    "let @xmath170 and @xmath171 denote these eigenvectors ( normalized so @xmath172 ) and their associated eigenvalues . in the hydrodynamics literature , the eigenvectors @xmath173",
    "are sometimes called instantaneous optimals ; the @xmath170 with maximum @xmath171 is the fluctuation that maximizes the instantaneous @xmath151 .",
    "we may decompose the state vector in the @xmath170 basis : @xmath174 for some amplitudes @xmath175 .",
    "using this decomposition in ( [ eq : avg ] ) gives @xmath176 neglecting the uninteresting case in which all terms in the sum ( [ eq : sum ] ) are zero , then there must be at least one positive eigenvalue @xmath177 with an associated nonzero average weight @xmath178 .",
    "considering the associated @xmath179 in ( [ eq : dwdt2 ] ) , then this state @xmath179 must give positive @xmath151 , proving statement 2 .",
    "thus , we have showed in two ways that transient linear amplification is a necessary condition for turbulence in the associated nonlinear system .",
    "we have also shown that the amplitude of the transiently growing state(s ) must have a significant amplitude in the turbulent state , in the following senses . in the first line of argument , not only must there be at least a single growing 2d mode , but there must be enough growing 2d modes of sufficient amplitude to balance the negative @xmath152 of all the decaying 2d modes . in the second argument , in ( [ eq : sum ] ) there must not only be at least one state @xmath180 with an instantaneous growth rate @xmath181 , but the amplitudes of states with positive and negative @xmath171 must be in balance so @xmath182 . in a statistically steady state , there must be a balance between energy input from the instantaneously growing linear states and the instantaneously decaying linear states .    both of the arguments above relied on the fact that the norm @xmath58 satisfies the same equation ( [ eq : dwdt ] ) in both the linear and nonlinear dynamics .",
    "thus , the `` nonlinear invariant '' @xmath58 is a special norm , and the arguments do not generally apply to other norm - like quantities such as @xmath183 in which one might choose to measure transient amplification .",
    "( in fact for any operator with damped eigenmodes , even if transient amplification exists in one norm , another norm always exists in which transient amplification is impossible .",
    "the sum of squared eigenmode coefficients is such a norm @xcite . )    while the arguments here relied on the gyrokinetic conservation law ( [ eq : dwdt ] ) , the same reasoning may be applied to other models and systems in which an energy conservation equation holds . for example , eq ( 6 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite gives the appropriate conservation law for the fluid model in that work , and the first line of ( 6 ) gives the associated norm to use in place of @xmath58 .",
    "the `` universal mode '' system ( slab geometry with a density gradient , electrostatic , no sheared equilibrium flow , and weak temperature gradients ) is known to have a dramatic change in linearly stability as the magnetic shear is raised from zero to small finite values @xcite . as the eigenvalues are so sensitive to magnetic shear , we might expect traditional modal analysis to give a misleading picture of typical behavior , as with other systems that have sensitive eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "indeed , here we have demonstrated that significant transient linear amplification is possible in the drift wave system even when all eigenmodes are decaying .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : comparingtransientto0shear ] , the transient structures grow at the zero - shear growth rate , when evaluated at the dominant @xmath85 and @xmath91 at that instant . we have demonstrated that the amount and duration of amplification scale with the magnetic shear length @xmath10 , so these quantities naturally become unbounded in the limit of vanishing shear",
    ". the non - modal amplification also decreases with increasing collisionality , particularly at the shortest perpendicular wavelengths , and the amplification tends to be largest at wavelengths near @xmath184 .",
    "in contrast to more famous examples of non - modal amplification from hydrodynamics @xcite , and to some recent examples from plasma physics @xcite , the amplification in the plasma drift wave system here does not depend on sheared equilibrium flow .",
    "we have also demonstrated using nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations that sustained turbulence is possible in this system even when all linear modes are damped .",
    "this phenomenon had been seen previously in fluid models @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , clearly visible in figure [ fig : amplitudedependence ] , is opposite to the `` dimits shift '' @xcite seen at different physical parameters , in which nonlinear fluctuations are suppressed despite the presence of linear instability .    in this system without unstable eigenvalues , we find that sustained nonlinear turbulence and transient linear amplification both become possible around @xmath185 ( for the collisionality @xmath73 and other parameters considered . ) as discussed in section [ sec : proof ] , the fact that these two phenomena appear together is not a coincidence .",
    "transient linear amplification in the free energy norm @xmath58 is a necessary condition for statistically steady turbulence , and the turbulent state must have a significant projection onto states that are linearly growing in the @xmath58 norm . when the nonlinear term is turned off in a simulation of turbulence , as in figure [ fig : linearrestart ]",
    ", amplification in @xmath58 norm must occur in at least one of the 2d modes .",
    "the amplitude of the instantaneously growing states ( instantaneous optimals ) must be significant , enough for the associated input of free energy to balance decay of energy from the states that are decaying .",
    "considering the nonlinear and linear results together , the existence of transient amplification and turbulence evidently depends on whether magnetic shear is sufficiently weak that un - sheared slab mode dynamics can persist .",
    "this geometric property can be controlled independently of the energy source of the turbulence ( i.e. the density gradient ) , in contrast to turbulence driven by sheared flows where the nonuniformity of the flow plays two roles at once : shaping the global structure of the growing structures and providing energy to the turbulence .",
    "this feature makes the present system an interesting case study of sub - critical turbulence , and we are unaware of other such examples .     note that the transient linear process emphasized here and secondary instability are not mutually exclusive .",
    "both are required to support turbulence .",
    "some form of secondary instability ( as discussed in @xcite ) must be present to transfer energy out of the transiently growing linear structures before these structures begin to decay substantially .",
    "however , nonlinear processes can not directly contribute to the system s free energy @xmath58 , due to the annihilation of the nonlinear term in deriving ( [ eq : dwdt ] ) .",
    "several effects that may be important for realistic plasma turbulence were not included in the present work , including toroidicity and trapped particles , and electromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "therefore , further work is required to determine how relevant the nonlinear turbulence considered here is for realistic experimental parameters .",
    "however , we at least conclude that linear stability need not preclude the possibility of significant turbulent particle and energy fluxes , and that nonlinear simulations should sometimes be initialized at finite amplitude to examine this possibility .",
