    "nucleons are the most common form of hadronic matter on the earth and probably in the whole universe . to understand the internal quark - gluon structure of nucleon and its excited states",
    "@xmath8 s is one of the most important tasks in nowadays particle and nuclear physics .",
    "the main source of information for the nucleon internal structure is their mass spectrum , various production and decay rates .",
    "our present knowledge on this aspect came almost entirely from the old generation of @xmath12 experiments of more than twenty years ago  @xcite .",
    "considering its importance for the understanding of the nonperturbative qcd  @xcite , a new generation of experiments on @xmath8 physics with electromagnetic probes ( real photon and space - like virtual photon ) has recently been started at new facilities such as cebaf at jlab , elsa at bonn , graal at grenoble .",
    "the @xmath11 experiment at the beijing electron - positron collider(bepc ) has long been known as the best place for looking for glueballs .",
    "but in fact it is also an excellent place for studying @xmath8 resonances  @xcite , especially in the mass range 1 - 2 gev .",
    "the corresponding feynman graphs for the @xmath8 and @xmath13 production are shown in fig .",
    "[ figfy ] .",
    "these graphs are almost identical to those describing the @xmath8 electro - production process if the direction of the time axis is rotated by @xmath14 .",
    "the only difference is that the virtual photon here is time - like instead of space - like and couples to @xmath15 through a real vector charmonium meson @xmath11 .",
    "therefore almost all channels of @xmath8 decays studied at the cebaf and other @xmath16 facilities can also be studied here .    among many interesting channels ,",
    "the @xmath17 is a relatively simple one to begin with . according to the information  @xcite from @xmath18 and @xmath19 experiments , as well as some early quark shell model calculation  @xcite",
    ", only @xmath20 has a big decay branching ratio to @xmath21 , while @xmath22 may have a branching ratio to @xmath21 of up to 10% and other @xmath8 resonances below 2.0 gev have much smaller branching ratios to the @xmath21 .    in this paper , we present bes data and a partial wave analysis on the @xmath23 reaction . the @xmath24 and @xmath25 are observed .",
    "this is the first partial wave study of the production of these @xmath8 resonances from the @xmath11 hadronic decays in the world .",
    "the new information on @xmath26 couplings provides a new source for studying baryon structure@xcite .",
    "the analysis in this paper uses @xmath27 triggers collected by the beijing spectrometer(bes ) .",
    "bes is a conventional solenoidal magnet detector that is described in detail in ref .",
    "a four - layer central drift chamber(cdc ) surrounding the beampipe provides trigger information . a forty - layer cylindrical main drift chamber(mdc ) , located radially outside the cdc , provides trajectory and energy loss ( @xmath28 ) information for charged tracks over @xmath29 of the total solid angle .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath30(@xmath31 in gev / c ) , and the @xmath28 resolution for hadron tracks is @xmath32 .",
    "an array of 48 scintillation counters(with inner radius of 1.157 meter and outer radius 1.207 meter)surrounding the mdc measures the time - of - flight(tof ) of charged tracks with a resolution of @xmath33 ps for hadrons .",
    "radially outside of tof system is a 12 radiation length thick , lead - gas barrel shower counter(bsc ) operating in the limited streamer mode .",
    "this device covers   80% of the total solid angle and measures the energies of electrons and photons with an energy resolution of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 gev ) . outside",
    "the bsc is a solenoid , which provides a 0.4 tesla magnetic field over the tracking volume .",
    "an iron flux return is instrumented with three double layers of counters that identify muons of momentum greater than 0.5 gev / c .",
    "the @xmath36 is detected here in its @xmath37 decay mode .",
    "therefore , much effort has been devoted to the selection of the events in the @xmath38 final state . each candidate event is required to have two oppositely signed charged tracks with a good helix fit in the polar angle range @xmath39 in mdc and at least 2 reconstructed @xmath40 s in bsc .",
    "a vertex is required within an interaction region @xmath41 cm longitudinally and 2 cm radially . a minimum energy cut of 60  mev is imposed on the photons .",
    "showers associated with charged tracks are also removed .",
    "after above selection , we use tof information to identify the @xmath42 pairs , and at least one track with unambiguous tof information is required .",
    "the open angle of two charged tracks smaller than @xmath43 is required in order to remove back to back events ; to remove radiative bhabha events , we require @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) are the energy deposited in bsc and momentum of positron ( electron ) respectively .",
    "events are fitted kinematically to the 4c hypotheses @xmath49 .",
    "if the number of the selected photons is larger than two , the fit is repeated using all permutations of the photons . for events with a good fit",
    ", the two photon combination with the largest probability is selected .",

    "we require @xmath53 to reject the @xmath54 and @xmath55 backgrounds . in order to suppress further the backgrounds with a @xmath50 ,",
    "a 5c fit for the @xmath56 with @xmath57 is performed on the selected events .",
    "@xmath58 is required .",

    "there are also some bumps around 1.65 gev and 1.8 gev .",
    "in order to estimate the selection efficiency , a phase space generator is used to produce a sample of @xmath60 events with full detector simulation , it is 18% after the monte carlo data go through the same cuts as real data .    since @xmath61 is the final state of the reaction channel , the possible background may come from @xmath62 , @xmath55 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 decay modes . for each channel ,",
    "10,000 mc events are generated .",
    "these mc events go through the same analysis program as for the real data .",

    "the estimated background is 8% ,    a correct estimation of the background invariant mass shape is essential to the partial wave analysis .",

    "based on the study of @xmath42 and @xmath68 invariant mass distributions in our data , we are mainly interested in the structures at 1535 and 1650 mev of the @xmath68 invariant mass . according to pdg@xcite , below 1900 mev",

    "although the two @xmath68 structures at 1535 and 1650 mev in our data are most probably due to @xmath9 and @xmath10 states , we perform the partial wave analysis by allowing all possible quantum numbers of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78",

    ", we can deduce the transition form factor for the time - like virtual photon to @xmath136 as |g_^*pn^*(q^2=m_^2)|= 2.30.5 , which is related to the more familiar helicity amplitude @xmath137 for @xmath138 by |a^p_1/2|^2=()^2 .",
    "this is the first measurement of the form factor @xmath139 for a time - like virtual photon .",
    "it provides a new challenge for various theoretical models to reproduce it , complementary to the information for a real or space - like virtual photon@xcite .",
    "in summary , the @xmath11 decay at bepc provides a new excellent laboratory for studying the @xmath8 resonances .",
    "we have studied the @xmath140 decay channel , and a pwa analysis is performed on the data .",
