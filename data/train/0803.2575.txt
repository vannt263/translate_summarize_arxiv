    "x - ray studies of point sources within clusters are somewhat difficult , because observations of the galaxies are normally impeded by luminous diffuse emission of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) and limited angular resolution of the telescopes .",
    "recently , equipped with unprecedented spatial resolution and positional precision instruments , _ xmm - newton _ and @xmath18 are uncovering higher fractions of galaxies in cluster fields compared to non - cluster fields .",

    "several high - redshift clusters of galaxies have been reported to have an overdensity of x - ray point sources on their outskirts , which is naturally attributed to infall related fueling of active nuclei .",
    "cappi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found 53 and 44 point sources from 3c295 and rx j0030 fields respectively , and reported an overdensity in these high redshifts ( @xmath0 @xmath10 0.5 ) .",

    "they also surveyed ms0451 ( @xmath20 0.55 ) but found no evidence of an excess , so concluded that different classes of objects seem to dominate in different clusters .",

    "the emission from individual sources in these clusters stands out particularly well as the diffuse emission is not very luminous .",
    "a194 is selected as a very faint ( @xmath22 @xmath10 10@xmath23 ergs s@xmath9 ) , poor cluster with no clear extended emission and no x - ray peak .",

    "the temperature distribution of icm is uniform at @xmath24 = 2.7 kev .",
    "the cluster is also a strong radio emitter .",
    "conversely , a1060 is x - ray brighter ( @xmath22 @xmath10 1 @xmath6 10@xmath25 ergs s@xmath9 ) than a194 . the cluster is dominated by a pair of giant ellipticals , ngc 3309 and ngc 3311 .",
    "a circularly symmetric smooth surface brightness , isothermal icm ( @xmath24 = 3.3 kev ) and being populated by at least six bright ngc galaxies in the central region make the source very suitable for our survey .",
    "we adopt @xmath26=75 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 and cosmological deceleration parameter of @xmath27=0.5 .",
    "the luminosity distances to a194 and a1060 are 73 mpc and 46 mpc , and an angular size of 1 arcmin corresponds to 20.5 kpc and 13 kpc , respectively .",

    "2001 ) and the epic - pn detector ( strder et al . 2001 ) , are used .",
    "the a194 cluster field was observed with the _ xmm - newton _ satellite in revolution 557 on december 2002 .",
    "the cameras were operated in prime full window mode with the thin filters .",
    "a1060 was observed on june 2004 in revolution 834 .",
    "the medium filter was used for three epic cameras . in our study , the lockman hole is chosen and referred to as the blank field to compare with the cluster fields .",
    "we selected four recent long late observations of the lockman hole .",
    "the total exposure is @xmath10400 ks .",
    "all three cameras in the four observations were performed with the medium filter .",
    "the difference in the count rates from using medium and thin optical filters is negligible .",

    "the summary of the observations is given in table [ obs_log ] .",
    "the event lists were generated from the observation data files ( odf ) by the tasks emchain and epchain .",
    "we then selected the events with pattern 0 - 12 for mos and single @xmath19 double pixel events ( pattern 0 - 4 ) for pn . in order to clean the contamination by soft proton flares ,",
    "the extracted light curves for mos ( 10 - 12 kev ) and pn ( 12 - 14 kev ) are clipped above and below 2.7@xmath11 of the average count rate . finally , the resulting good time intervals ( gti ) selections are applied to the event lists to produce filtered event files .",
    "we performed multi - band source detection on the epic images in the soft band of 0.3@xmath291 kev ( s ) , medium band 1@xmath291.6 kev ( m ) , and hard band 1.6@xmath2910 kev ( h ) .",
    "the main concern with this energy selection is to identify diversity of sources with relative sensitivities at different energy bands .",
    "principally , the diagnosis of intrinsic absorption effects and power - law emission is intended .",
    "this energy selection also splits the counts evenly which is statistically more favorable .",
    "the source detection is performed with two different sas tasks in order to carry out a comparable detection .",
    "these are the maximum likelihood ( cash 1979 ) method `` emldetect '' and the wavelet detection routine `` ewavelet '' ( damiani et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the three x - ray images were scanned by using both methods .",
    "the relation between likelihood limit ( @xmath30 ) and gaussian probability ( @xmath31 ) is given as @xmath32 .",
    "we selected a minimum likehood ml=10 and @xmath33 gaussian of signal - to - noise ratio , at which a probability of @xmath10 @xmath3410@xmath35 is attained by both values .",
    "the methods take into account vignetting and psf variations by means of the relative exposure maps .",
    "the obtained lists are compared and sources falling outside of 25 arcmin circle are removed .",
    "the final list is prepared by merging the three energy - band source lists for both pn and mos into a summary source list with the sas command `` srcmatch '' .    with the source detection routines mentioned above ,",
    "the final merged lists contain 56 and 32 point sources for a194 and a1060 , respectively .",
    "the lockman hole observations have longer exposures and no contamination by extended x - ray emission as opposed to those of the cluster fields , thus the number of detected sources ( 173 ) is naturally higher .",
    "the sources are expected to have different spectral types , hence not all sources are detected significantly in all three energy bands .",
    "it is also worth noting that some of the sources have been detected by only mos or pn .",
    "these sources are located at either in or around chip gaps .",
    "the source numbers for each camera and each energy band are given in table [ source_numbers ] .",
    "the minimum flux values at 2@xmath2910 kev among the detected sources are 1.28@xmath36 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 and 1.23@xmath36 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 for a194 and a1060 .",
    "we will use only pn data for the rest of the analysis , because it has higher sensitivity than mos cameras .",
    "we have developed a color diagram to determine average spectral properties of a given sample , because not all of the sources have statistically sufficient photon counts to allow individual spectral fitting .",
    "the color diagram is known to be a sensitive tool to define source types ( white @xmath19 marshall 1984 ) .",
    "we defined two hardness ratio ( hr ) values ; and plot soft ratio hr1=(m@xmath29s)/(m@xmath37s ) against hard ratio hr2=(h@xmath29m)/(h@xmath37 m ) .",
    "the hardness ratios are calculated from the net count rates in the soft , medium and hard bands obtained by the source detection routines .",

    "x - ray colors of sources with power - law spectra with photon index @xmath40 gets the values from 1.0 to 3.0 in 0.1 steps as the grid moves left . increasing absorption ( @xmath41=0.01 , 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.50 , 1.00 and 3.00@xmath610@xmath42@xmath8 ) effects push sources toward the upper right in the diagram.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]          we conducted simulations for each cluster to predict the locations of various sources in the color - diagram . the simulations of both clusters are practically equivalent",

    "it is known that galaxies funnel toward clusters through filaments , where galaxies appear like pearls on a string .",
    "the projection effect may cause an enhancement of the source density , if a filament aligns through the line of sight .",
    "simulations of the large scale formations ( gavernato et al . 1998 ) show a quantitatively higher number of densities on knots ( clusters ) than filaments . if one assumes that the observed x - ray excess is due to the projectional effects , the required length of a filament with 1 mpc average radius would be about 100 mpc .",
    "since mean cluster separation is several 10 mpc , the projection effect of the filamentary branches itself would be unrealistic .",
    "however , a partial enhancement from filaments is admitted .",
    "recent @xmath18 studies show that x - ray sources are not distributed randomly ( martini et al .",
    "2002 ; johnson et al . 2003 ) .",
    "bright sources are reported to populate at the outskirts , whereas faint ones are found somewhat nearer to the cluster center ( @xmath97 1 mpc ) .",

    "considering the restricted low luminosity range ( 10@xmath12@xmath13@xmath14@xmath1310@xmath15 ergs s@xmath9 ) and x - ray to optical luminosity ratios ( @xmath17 ) from our survey , the x - ray sources from the fields of a194 and a1060 are likely to be experiencing a similar physical situation .",
    "the fueling scenario can account for the excess for the faint sources and the quenching can explain the population vanishing for the bright sources as obtained from the xlf ( figure [ ueda_fig ] ) .",
    "the dense cluster environments are the places with high possibility of collisions and close encounters of galaxies in the vicinity of clusters .",
    "when a galaxy falls into the cluster gravitational potential , the balance between agn and surrounding gas is disturbed .",
    "the gas falls on to agn and powers it .",
    "the infall induces agn activity , therefore the source gets brighter .",
    "it is currently believed that most -if not all- galaxies , including our galaxy , host a black hole ( bh ) at its center .",
    "most of them are inactive not accreting much matter .",
    "the physical conditions in the icm may also awake these kinds of starved bhs , which increases the x - ray sources density in clusters .",
    "however , the mechanism reverses at smaller distances from the center as the galaxy loses a significant amount of its fuel by ram - pressure striping .",
    "agn activity is reduced by deep cluster potential . in other words ,",
    "agn activity decreases for the longer residents .",
