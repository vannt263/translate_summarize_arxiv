    "there are many situations in which the hamiltonian is equal to the sum of the generalized kinetic energy @xmath6 and the generalized potential @xmath7 .",
    "the conditions are that the generalized potential is not a function of generalized velocities , and the generalized kinetic energy is a homogeneous quadratic function of generalized velocities . once the generalized potential @xmath7 , which is under the framework of the hamiltonian system , is obtained , the problem of the small oscillations of a system about positions of equilibrium can be easily dealt with . for a conservative mechanical system",
    "its equilibrium state can be obtained by @xmath8 the generalized potential has an extremum at the equilibrium configuration of the system , which is marked with the subscript @xmath9 .",
    "the equilibrium is stable when the extremum of the potential @xmath7 is the minimum , and unstable otherwise .    up to now , to our knowledge ,",
    "the canonical equations of hamilton appearing in all the literatures are of the form ( [ ce for 2ed ] ) except for our recent work , where it is pointed out that the canonical equations of hamilton ( [ ce for 2ed ] ) are only valid for the second - order differential system ( the system described by the second - order partial differential equation about the evolution coordinate ) but not valid for the first - order differential system ( the system described by the first - order partial differential equation about the evolution coordinate ) .",
    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) is the first - order differential system , which is a universal nonlinear model that describes many nonlinear physical systems and can be applied to hydrodynamics  @xcite , nonlinear optics  @xcite , nonlinear acoustics  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , and so on .",

    "[ conclusion ] gives the summary .",
    "the propagation of the light - envelope in the nonlocal cubic nonlinear media is modeled by the nonlocal nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nnlse ) in the dimensionless system  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the complex amplitude envelop , @xmath12 is the longitudinal coordinate , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the @xmath15-dimensional transverse coordinate vectors .",
    "@xmath16 is a @xmath15-dimensional volume element at @xmath14 , @xmath17 is the @xmath15-dimensional transverse laplacian operator , and @xmath18 is normalized response function of the media such that @xmath19 . for a singular response ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath20 , eq.([nnlse ] ) simplifies to the nlse @xmath21 when @xmath22 , nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) can describe the propagations of both optical beams  @xcite and pulses  @xcite .",
    "particularly , it was predicted very recently  @xcite that strongly nonlocal temporal solitons can exist in the model  ( [ nnlse ] ) . the second term of ( [ nnlse ] ) models the diffraction for the optical beam , and the group velocity dispersion ( gvd )  @xcite for the optical pulse",
    ". the nonlinear term of ( [ nnlse ] ) describes the self focusing of the optical beam  @xcite and optical pulse  @xcite . generally speaking , when @xmath23 , nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) only describes the propagations of optical beams .",
    "the propagation of a pulsed optical beam can be described by the nnlse , and a optical bullet  @xcite can be obtained when @xmath24 . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) is just a phenomenological model , the counterpart of which can not be found in physics .",
    "the response function @xmath18 can be symmetric for the optical beam , but is asymmetric for the optical pulse due to the causality  @xcite .",
    "to find the approximately analytical solution of the nnlse , the variational approach is widely used  @xcite .",
    "the reason that the variational approach can be applied to the nnlse is that the nnlse can be viewed as the euler - lagrange equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the lagrangian density . replacing @xmath28 with @xmath29 , the complex - conjugate equation of the nnlse",
    "can be obtained from the euler - lagrange equation ( [ euler - lagrange equation ] ) .",
    "it is easy to calculate the first two terms of eq .",
    "( [ euler - lagrange equation ] ) , but is some difficult to calculate the last term because of the convolution between the response function and the intensity of the optical beam for the nnlse . in the following",
    "we will take the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) with @xmath22 as an example to discuss the condition under which the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) is equivalent to the euler - lagrange equation ( [ euler - lagrange equation ] ) .",
    "the lagrangian density of the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) is @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 . inserting the lagrangian density ( [ lagrangian density ] ) into the euler - lagrange equation ( [ euler - lagrange equation ] ) , the first two terms of ( [ euler - lagrange equation ] )",
    "can be easily obtained as @xmath32 to calculate the last term , we first construct a functional by integrating the last term of the lagrangian density ( [ lagrangian density ] ) as @xmath33 the variation of the functional @xmath34 can be obtained by definition as @xmath35dx'dx\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\delta n\\left[\\varphi(x)\\delta\\varphi^*(x)+\\varphi^*(x)\\delta\\varphi(x)\\right]dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the response function is a even function , i.e. , @xmath36 , then we can obtain that @xmath37dx'dx=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\delta n\\left[\\varphi(x)\\delta\\varphi^*(x)+\\varphi^*(x)\\delta\\varphi(x)\\right]dx$ ] .",
    "then the variation of the functional @xmath34 is simplified to @xmath38 because the variation of the functional @xmath34 can be also expressed as @xmath39\\delta\\varphi(x)dx+\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varphi^*}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\delta n(x)|\\varphi(x)|^2\\right]\\delta\\varphi^*(x)dx.\\ ] ] comparing eq.([deal with convolution ] ) and ( [ variation ] ) , we obtain @xmath40&=&\\delta n\\varphi(x),\\label{tonnlse}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varphi}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\delta n(x)|\\varphi(x)|^2\\right]&=&\\delta n\\varphi^*(x).\\label{tonnlsecm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) can be obtained from the euler - lagrange equation ( [ euler - lagrange equation ] ) by combining eq.([first two terms ] ) and eq.([tonnlse ] ) , its complex - conjugate equation can be obtained by combining eq.([first two terms ] ) and eq.([tonnlsecm ] ) .",
    "consequently , it is conditional to apply the variational approach to the nnlse , that is , the response function must be an even function .",
    "when the response function is not an even function , the variational approach will do not work any longer .",
    "we will use the canonical equations of hamilton to deal with the nonlinear light - envelope propagations .",
    "however the canonical equations of hamilton appearing in all the literatures , except for our recent work , are only valid for the second - order differential system but not valid for the first - order differential system while the nnlse ( [ nnlse ] ) is the first - order differential system .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to briefly introduce the canonical equations of hamilton for the first - order differential system first .",
    "for the first - order differential system of the continuous systems , the lagrangian density must be the linear function of the generalized velocities , and expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is not the function of a set of @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , the generalized momentum @xmath44 , which is obtained by the definition @xmath45 as @xmath46 is only a function of @xmath47 .",
    "there are @xmath48 variables , @xmath47 and @xmath44 , in eqs .",
    "( [ equations of p q ] ) . the number of eqs .",
    "( [ equations of p q ] ) is @xmath49 , which also means there exist @xmath49 constraints between @xmath47 and @xmath44 .",
    "so the degree of freedom of the system given by eqs .",
    "( [ equations of p q ] ) is @xmath49 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we take @xmath50 and @xmath51 as the independent variables , where @xmath52 .",
    "the remaining generalized coordinates and generalized momenta can be expressed with these independent variables as @xmath53 and @xmath54 the hamiltonian density @xmath55 for the continuous system is obtained by the legendre transformation as @xmath56 , where the hamiltonian density @xmath55 is a function of @xmath57 generalized coordinates , @xmath50 , and @xmath58 generalized momenta , @xmath51 .",
    "we can obtain @xmath49 canonical equations of hamilton @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath52 ) .",
    "the canonical equations of hamilton ( [ canonical equations 1 for 1st order ] ) and ( [ canonical equations 2 for 1st order ] ) can be easily extended to the discrete system , which can be expressed as @xmath62 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath52 .",
    "before the application of the canonical equations of hamilton ( [ canonical equations 1 for 1st order for discrete system ] ) and ( [ canonical equations 2 for 1st order for discrete system ] ) , we should firstly calculate the hamiltonian by the legendre transformation reading @xmath63 , where the lagrangian @xmath64 can be obtained as @xmath65 the lagrangian @xmath64 is a function of generalized coordinates , @xmath66 and generalized velocities , @xmath67 .",
    "it is clear that the lagrangian is not an explicit function of @xmath12 , so the hamiltonian of the system is conservative .",
    "now , we assume the light - envelop has a given form , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 are the parameters changing with @xmath12 .",
    "it can be regarded as the variables transformation , with which we transform the coordinate system expressed by the set of generalized coordinate @xmath29 to the one expressed by another set of generalized coordinates @xmath69 . here",
    "we assume the material response is the gaussian function @xmath70 and the trial solution has the form , @xmath71\\exp\\left[iq_c(z)r^2+iq_{\\theta}(z)\\right ] , $ ] where @xmath72 are the amplitude and phase of the complex amplitude of the light - envelope , respectively , @xmath73 is the width of the light - envelope , @xmath74 is the phase - front curvature , and they all vary with the propagation distance @xmath12 .",
    "we obtain the lagrangian @xmath75,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a function of generalized coordinates , @xmath76 and generalized velocities , @xmath77 , but not an explicit function of @xmath12 .",
    "the generalized momenta can be obtained @xmath78 the hamiltonian of the system then can be determined by legendre transformation @xmath79,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and can be proved to be a constant , i.e. @xmath80    there are four generalized coordinates and four generalized momenta in the four equations ( [ p 0])([qc momentum])([p_theta ] )",
    ". so the degree of freedom of the set of equations ( [ p 0])([qc momentum])([p_theta ] ) is four . without loss of generality , we take @xmath81 and @xmath82 as the independent variables . from eqs.([qc momentum])([p_theta ] ) , the generalized coordinates @xmath83 can be expressed by generalized momenta @xmath84 and @xmath82 as @xmath85^{d/4 } , q_w=[4p_c/(dp_\\theta)]^{1/2 } , $ ] inserting which into the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , we have @xmath86 by use of the canonical equations of hamilton ( [ canonical equations 1 for 1st order for discrete system ] ) and ( [ canonical equations 2 for 1st order for discrete system ] ) , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 , we can obtain the following four equations @xmath89 because @xmath90 is a cyclic coordinate , the corresponding generalized momentum @xmath91 is a constant , which can be confirmed by eq.([dp_theta ] ) .",
    "in fact , this also represents that the power of the light - envelope , @xmath92 , is conservative . from this",
    "we can obtain @xmath93 taking the derivative with respect to @xmath12 on both sides of eq.([qc momentum ] ) , then comparing it with eq.([dpc ] ) , we can obtain with the aid of eq.([amplitude ] ) @xmath94 then inserting eq.([qc ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with the aid of eq.([amplitude ] ) , we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 for the system , there are only one independent generalized coordinate @xmath73 and one independent generalized velocity @xmath97 , which can be proved in the appendix .",
    "when the hamiltonian is expressed with independent variables , it is indeed the total energy expressed as the sum of the generalized kinetic energy and the generalized potential .",
    "the problem associated with the nnsle is a problem of small oscillations from the hamiltonian point of view .",
    "the soliton corresponds to the extremum point of the generalized potential .",
    "but in some literatures  @xcite , solitons were regarded as the extrema of the hamiltonian .",
    "such a treatment has some problem , because in those literatures the trial solution has a changeless profile ( solitonic profile ) , the system expressed with the solitonic profile is the static system .",
    "the kinetic energy of the static system is zero , and the hamiltonian is equal to the potential of the static system . in this connection ,",
    "the extremum of the hamiltonian is the extremum of the generalized potential of the static system .",
    "but when the system deviates from the equilibrium , the extremum of the hamiltonian is not the extremum of the generalized potential . from @xmath98",
    ", we have @xmath99 from eq.([critical power equation ] ) we can easily obtain the critical power , with which the light - envelope will propagate with a changeless shape . here",
    "we take the notation @xmath100 to denote the critical power instead of @xmath101 , then we obtain @xmath102 when @xmath103 , we can obtain that @xmath104 which implies that the wavefront of the soliton solution is a plane .",
    "the propagation constant is @xmath105/q_w^4 $ ]",
    ".    then we elucidate the stability characteristics of the soliton by means of the analysis of the generalized potential @xmath7 . performing the second - order derivative of the generalized potential @xmath7 with respect to @xmath73 , then inserting the critical power into it , we obtain @xmath106,\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the degree of nonlocality .",
    "the larger is @xmath108 , the stronger is the degree of nonlocality .",
    "when @xmath109 , the generalized potential has a minimum , and the soliton is stable . from eq.([stability criterion ] ) we can obtain the criterion of the stability of solitons , that is @xmath110 which is , in fact , consistent with the vakhitov - kolokolov ( vk ) criterion  @xcite with the aid of the results of ref.@xcite , and is proved briefly in  @xcite .      when @xmath111 , the response function @xmath112 .",
    "the nnlse will be reduced to the nlse ( [ nlse ] ) .",

    "so the ( 1 + 2)-dimensional local solitons are unstable .",
    "the relation between the potential @xmath7 and the width @xmath73 of the light - envelope is shown in fig.[potential plot ] .",
    "if the power of the light - envelope equals to the critical power , the potential will be a constant , as can be seen by dash curve of fig.([potential plot ] ) . without the external disturbance",
    ", the light - envelope will stay in its initial state , and keep its width changeless .",
    "if the external disturbance makes the power larger than the critical power , then the width will become more and more smaller , and collapses at last , as can be confirmed by the dash - dot curve of fig.[potential plot ] .",
    "if the external disturbance makes the power smaller than the critical power , then the width will become more and more larger , and diffracts at last , as can be confirmed by the solid curve of fig.[potential plot ] .",
    "these conclusions are consist with those of refs .",

    "that is to say the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional and the ( 1 + 2)-dimensional nonlocal solitons are always stable when the response function of the material is a gaussian function .",
    "it is consistent with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite . when @xmath118 the solitons can be stable only if the criterion of the stability eq.([stability criterion2 ] ) should be satisfied first , which is also the same as the result of ref.@xcite .",
    "the method employed in the paper , based on the hamiltonian formulation , is different from the widely used variational approach .",
    "the first difference is that the equations obtained by the two approaches are different .",
    "the equations obtained by the variational approach are the differential equations  @xcite .",
