    "<S> we demonstrate , for the first time , the realization of an entirely guided - wave squeezing experiment at a telecom wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the state generation relies on waveguide non - linear optics technology while squeezing collection and transmission are implemented by using only telecom fibre components . </S>",
    "<S> we observe up to @xmath0db of squeezing emitted at 1542 nm in cw pumping regime . </S>",
    "<S> the compactness and stability of the experiment , compared to free - space configurations , represent a significant step towards achieving out - of - the - lab cv quantum communication , fully compatible with existing telecom fibre networks . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this work stands as a promising approach for real applications as well as for `` do - it - yourself '' experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> generation and manipulation of continuous variable ( cv ) non - classical states of light are the object of intense research due to their importance in both fundamental and applied physics @xcite . among others , a valuable feature of cv quantum resources is that they can be generated in a deterministic way at the output of non - linear optical media @xcite . moreover , cv entanglement is affected but never vanishes completely for any level of external loss @xcite . on these bases </S>",
    "<S> , cv quantum optics has experienced an increasing interest for its application to quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , with many proposals based on both single - mode @xcite and two - mode squeezed light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement distillation and entanglement swapping schemes for long distance quantum communication have been demonstrated @xcite and systematic studies have been performed on the robustness of non - classicality against the communication channel losses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + a further step towards real - world applications of cv quantum communication has been done by generating squeezed light in the telecom c - band of wavelengths , where low - loss optical fibres and high performance standard components are available @xcite . in the perspective of implementing quantum networks that exploit optical fibres to connect distant atomic quantum memories , </S>",
    "<S> a quantum interface has recently been developed , converting squeezed light from telecom to visible wavelengths compatible with suitable atomic transitions @xcite . in the same spirit , a light - matter interface , coupling light guided in a tapered nanofibre to cold atoms , has been demonstrated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in this framework , and in order to comply with further out - of - the - lab realizations of cv quantum optics , we demonstrate , for the first time , the feasibility of a full guided - wave approach for both the generation and measurement of squeezed light at a telecom wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> + in our scheme , single - mode squeezing at 1542 nm is generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) in a periodically poled lithium niobate ridge - waveguide ( ppln / rw ) . at the output of the ppln / rw </S>",
    "<S> , the non - classical beam is measured with a fibre homodyne detector . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration allows implementing an extremely easy setup , entirely based on commercially available components , and fully compatible with existing fibre networks . on one hand , </S>",
    "<S> non - linear optics based on waveguide technology offers , compared to bulk implementations , better compactness and stability @xcite , as well as the possibility of efficient spdc in a single pass arrangement @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the use of off - the - shelf telecom fibre components permits the realization of a simple and plug - and - play setup that requires no alignment effort for spatial mode matching and that can be straightforwardly modified by connecting additional fibre components @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our approach , by first combining these two technologies and cv quantum optics , paves the way towards the realization of accessible and versatile experiments for cv quantum communication @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + eventually , we note that the possibility of miniaturizing cv quantum technologies is at the center of recent investigations , in particular with the demonstration of a photonic chip for _ in situ _ operations on squeezing @xcite . compared to this work </S>",
    "<S> , our paper follows a complementary vision by fully exploiting guided - wave optics for networking between remote quantum sources and nodes . </S>",
    "<S> +    the experimental setup is presented in fig.[setup]-a . </S>",
    "<S> a telecom continuous wave ( cw ) laser at 1542 nm ( _ toptica _ , dl pro , fibre coupled ) is amplified using an erbium doped fibre amplifier ( edfa , keopsys , cefa - c - hg ) and directed towards a 70:30 fibre beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> the less intense beam is used as the local oscillator ( lo ) for the homodyne detector . </S>",
    "<S> the brighter beam is frequency doubled to 771 nm via second harmonic generation ( shg ) to be subsequently employed as pump field for the spdc process for the squeezing generation . </S>",
    "<S> the shg stage is implemented employing a commercial periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide ( ppln / w , _ hc - photonics _ , efficiency of @xmath1 ) . at its output , frequency doubled light </S>",
    "<S> is directly collected using a single mode fibre . </S>",
    "<S> the beam at 771 nm then passes thought an in - line variable fibre attenuator and is directed towards the spdc stage . </S>",
    "<S> type-0 spdc is obtained in a 4 cm - long commercial ppln / rw working at frequency degeneracy around 1542 nm ( _ nel _ , wh-0770 - 000-f - b - c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that this is , to our knowledge , the first time a ppln / rw is employed for a cv experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the ridge waveguide structure offers a strong light confinement owing to a step index profile and guarantees high conversion efficiency over a large operation bandwidth of operation @xcite . by means of single - photon regime characterization , we estimate an spdc conversion efficiency of @xmath2 photon pairs / mw / ghz / s . </S>",
    "<S> the spdc emission covers a continuous spectral bandwidth of 80 nm fwhm ( see fig.[setup]-b ) , corresponding to 10thz in the frequency domain . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that , as no optical cavity is required to enhance the spdc process , this value represents directly the squeezing bandwidth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ppln / rw input and output facets are connected to polarization maintaining fibres ( pmfs ) , whose coupling with the ridge is optimized by the manufacturer thanks to micro - lenses . </S>",
    "<S> for the input pump beam at 771 nm , we measured a fibre - to - waveguide transmission of @xmath3 . at the output of the ridge waveguide , single - mode squeezed light at 1542 nm </S>",
    "<S> is collected with a measured coupling efficiency @xmath4 and it is directly available at the output of the pmf . to detect it , we send it to a fibre homodyne detector based on a 50:50 fibre beam splitter ( 50:50 f - bs ) followed by two ingaas photodiodes . in order to minimize fresnel reflection losses , </S>",
    "<S> the outputs of the 50:50 f - bs are spliced to ar - coated fibre optic patchcords . </S>",
    "<S> the measured transmission of the signal path from the pmf output to the homodyne optical outputs is @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> + in addition to the compactness and stability of the setup , a major advantage of guided - wave optics lies in the achievement of a high degree of spatial mode matching between the lo and the signal without optical adjustment at the 50:50 f - bs inputs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this huge benefit extremely simplifies the homodyne detector implementation ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> setup]-a ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , compared to the pulsed regime , cw pumping bypasses the difficulties of obtaining a lo matched with squeezed light in the temporal domain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> polarization matching is simply obtained by inserting a fibre polarization controller on the lo path . </S>",
    "<S> a home - made fibre stretcher implements the lo phase scanning @xcite . at the 50:50 f - bs outputs , light </S>",
    "<S> is directly sent to two ingaas photodiodes ( _ thorlabs _ , fga10 , without cap ) showing each @xmath6 quantum efficiency at 1542 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the difference photocurrent , obtained by connecting the photodiodes to each other , is amplified by a low - noise home - made transimpedence amplifier with bandwidth of @xmath75mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the noise power is measured for each quadrature phase by an electronic spectrum analyzer ( esa , _ hp _ , esa - l1500a ) set at zero - span around the analyzing frequency . as discussed in @xcite , the observed bandwidth of squeezed states produced by ppln / ws </S>",
    "<S> is ultimately limited by that of the homodyne detection .    in our experiment , we chose to work at 2mhz , where for a lo of 6.3mw , we observe a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 15.6db . </S>",
    "<S> residual electronic noise associated with the detectors affects the measurement as an additional loss and can be taken into account by a factor @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that squeezing at the telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm can be detected over bandwidths of more than 2ghz , by means of ultra - fast detectors and electronics @xcite . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , we recall that the exploitation of broadband squeezing is a key element for quantum channel multiplexing and high - speed quantum communication @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in the presence of losses , the variance of measured squeezed state quadratures , @xmath9 , can be written as @xcite : @xmath10 + 1-\\eta , \\label{quad}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the overall detection efficiency . here , the values @xmath12=0 and @xmath12=@xmath13/2 correspond to anti - squeezing and squeezing , respectively . in equation ( [ quad ] ) , the squeezing parameter @xmath14 depends on the spdc pump power as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is proportional to the crystal length and to the non - linear interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> + fig.[sqvspower ] shows squeezing and anti - squeezing ( both in db ) as functions of the pump power at 771 nm . </S>",
    "<S> each point corresponds to an average over several acquisitions with an error of @xmath17db . </S>",
    "<S> data include the effect of imperfect ridge waveguide - to - fibre coupling , propagation losses in the waveguide and in the fibre components , non - unitary detection efficiency , and residual electronics noise . </S>",
    "<S> pump powers reported on the graph are estimated with an error of @xmath18 and refer to inferred values at the ppln / rw input , taking into account the coupling and propagation losses at 771 nm . </S>",
    "<S> different power levels are obtained with the variable attenuator at the shg output . as it can be seen , experimental data for both squeezing and anti - squeezing correctly follow the quadratic behavior predicted by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> this shows , in particular , the absence of unwanted excess noise on anti - squeezed quadratures . by fitting the entire ensemble of data with equation ( [ quad ] ) , we obtain @xmath19mw@xmath20 and an overall detection efficiency @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of @xmath22 with our estimated detection efficiency , @xmath23 , gives for the propagation losses inside the ridge waveguide @xmath240.4db / cm , in agreement with typical reported values @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.[squeezing ] shows a typical squeezing curve obtained by scanning the phase of the local oscillator overtime . </S>",
    "<S> it corresponds to the highest pump power ( 28mw ) coupled inside the ppln / rw and to a measured squeezing value of @xmath0db , with an anti squeezing of @xmath25db . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that , by correcting the measured values for @xmath26 , we can infer the squeezing at the output of the waveguide to be @xmath7 - 3.3db , which is among the best values reported to date for cw - pumped squeezing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a further improvement could be obtained by reducing the propagation losses inside the ppln / rw and by employing detectors with a higher @xmath27 at @xmath71550 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the fabrication of low loss ridge waveguides is at the center of intense investigations with encouraging results leading to propagation losses lower than @xmath28db / cm @xcite . in parallel , detection efficiencies as high as @xmath29 at 1550 nm </S>",
    "<S> have already been demonstrated on custom detectors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , the setup performances could be enhanced by improved pumping conditions . </S>",
    "<S> these could be achieved , for example , by implementing another ppln / rw for the shg - stage . this way , higher optical powers at 771 nm could be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , an improved fibre - to - waveguide coupling at the spdc stage would lead to a greater efficiency for the squeezing generation . </S>",
    "<S> + let us emphasize that for any application relying on entanglement as a quantum ressource , our setup can be easily modified so as to generate two - mode squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by mixing the output of two identical ppln / rws at a 50:50 f - bs plugged just before the homodyne detector . </S>",
    "<S> the use of such a fibre component would automatically guarantee the mode - matching conditions for high - visibility quantum interference between the two squeezed states @xcite and will only introduce additional propagation loss typically of @xmath30db . by considering our measured best squeezing level of @xmath0db and based on the duan criterion for cv entanglement </S>",
    "<S> , this would lead to a correlation variance of @xmath31 , which is well below the classical limit and in line with recent experiments showing the on - chip detection of einstein - podolsky - rosen entanglement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion , based on advanced waveguide non - linear optics and telecom technology , we have implemented for the first time an entirely guided - wave optical setup allowing both the generation and the detection of single - mode squeezed light at a telecom wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> we observe squeezing levels down to of @xmath0db . </S>",
    "<S> our setup emploies plug - and - play components fully compatible with existing telecom fibre networks and requiring no alignment procedures for spatial mode matching . </S>",
    "<S> these advantages guarantee an extreme reliability and make our approach a valuable candidate for real - world quantum communication based on continuous variable quantum optics . </S>"
