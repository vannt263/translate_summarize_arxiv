    "thermal inflation @xcite provides the most compelling solution to the moduli ( polonyi ) problem @xcite",
    ". however , for a theory of the early universe to be viable it must be capable of producing a baryon asymmetry @xcite @xmath6 by the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "thermal inflation probably dilutes any pre - existing baryon asymmetry to negligible amounts , and the final reheat temperature after thermal inflation ( @xmath7 few gev ) is probably too low even for electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "thus if thermal inflation really is the solution of the moduli problem , then it is likely also to be responsible for baryogenesis .    in section  [ ti ]",
    "we explain why the flaton that gives rise to thermal inflation probably also generates the masses of right - handed neutrinos as well as the @xmath1-term of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we also note the various ways in which a potential domain wall problem can be avoided . in section  [ ad ]",
    "we describe how a somewhat complicated affleck - dine type mechanism can naturally generate the required baryon asymmetry after thermal inflation . in section  [ con ]",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "the superpotential of the mssm is @xcite @xmath8 thermal inflation @xcite requires that there is in addition at least one flaton @xmath9 with vacuum expectation value @xmath10 in the range @xmath11 , the lower bound coming from the requirement that thermal inflation sufficiently dilutes the moduli , and the upper bound from the requirement that the final reheat temperature after thermal inflation @xmath12 be high enough to thermalise the lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsp s ) produced in the flaton s decay and so avoid an excess of lsp s .    also , in order for @xmath9 to be held sufficiently strongly in eq .",

    "@xcite . ] at @xmath13 by the finite temperature during thermal inflation , @xmath9 must have unsuppressed couplings to at least one other field , say @xmath14 , that is light when @xmath13 .",
    "we therefore either require a term @xmath15 with @xmath16 in the superpotential , or require @xmath9 to spontaneously break a continuous gauge symmetry with gauge coupling @xmath17 ( with @xmath14 being the gauge field in this case ) .",
    "one reason to prefer the yukawa coupling over the gauge coupling is that the renormalisation group @xcite effect of the yukawa coupling would be to drive the soft supersymmetry breaking mass squared of @xmath9 negative at low energies as is required for a flaton , while the gauge coupling would have the opposite effect .",
    "another reason is that the gauge symmetry has no independent motivation , while , as we shall see , the yukawa coupling is very well motivated .",
    "we will therefore focus on the case of the yukawa coupling .",
    "after @xmath9 acquires its vacuum expectation value @xmath18 , @xmath14 will acquire a mass @xmath19 to @xmath20 and so is not a mssm field . in order for @xmath9 to be coupled to the thermal bath , which is presumably composed of mssm fields , we therefore require @xmath14 to couple to the mssm .",
    "we therefore is not charged with respect to the mssm continuous gauge symmetries as this would , in general , destroy susy gut gauge coupling unification .",
    "however , if @xmath14 is a complete @xmath21 multiplet the unification of the gauge couplings will be unaffected .",
    "for example , one could have @xmath22 .",
    "alternatively , appropriate choices of representations could shift the unification scale to the string scale @xcite . ]",
    "require at least one s , one charged and one neutral under r - parity .",
    "] of the terms @xmath23 or @xmath24 in the superpotential , as these are the only possible renormalisable couplings of a singlet to the mssm .",
    "the former is the standard coupling @xmath25 of a right - handed neutrino @xmath26 to the mssm , and furthermore @xmath27 automatically acquires a mass @xmath28 to @xmath20 in the right range for the seesaw mechanism @xcite to generate a left - handed tau neutrino mass @xmath29 suitable for the mixed dark matter scenario for the formation of the large scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "the latter coupling @xmath24 does not have any good independent motivation , apart from the fact that it is possible .",
    "we will therefore focus on the former case .",
    "later though , we shall make use of this possibility for coupling to the mssm in a different context .      now that we have a more precise picture of the couplings of the flaton , @xmath30 we can hope to make a more precise estimate of the decay rate of the flaton and so the final reheat temperature after thermal inflation @xmath12 .",
    "we first note that the effective superpotential coupling @xmath31 obtained by integrating out @xmath27 , eliminating @xmath27 via the constraint @xmath32 , will give a decay rate of order @xmath33 which is negligible .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of the low energy renormalised coupling constants will give larger decay rates . to estimate these we first need to know the contributions of the right - handed neutrinos to the renormalisation group equations .",
    "they are @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the logarithm of the renormalistion scale , the @xmath36 s are the soft supersymmetry breaking masses , the @xmath37 s are the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters in the terms in the scalar potential of the form @xmath38 , the @xmath36 s and the magnitudes of the @xmath37 s are of the order of the soft supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and the   stand for other terms independent of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "@xmath41 sets the threshold for the right - handed neutrinos , and so writing @xmath42 we get the effective couplings @xmath43 and @xmath44 from these couplings we estimate the total decay rate to be @xmath45 this would give a final reheat temperature after thermal inflation of @xmath46 where the first bracket is constrained to be of order one , or perhaps less , by eq .",

    "@xmath51 is not only allowed but could naturally generate a @xmath1-term @xmath52 of the required size @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath53 and @xmath54 we get @xmath55 . from now on we will assume that the @xmath1-term is generated in this way so that @xmath56 , or at least @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .    writing @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we get the relatively unsuppressed couplings @xmath62 where a tilde denotes the fermionic component of the superfield , a bar denotes the hermitian conjugate , and @xmath63 is the soft supersymmetry breaking parameter in @xmath64 and so @xmath65 . the decay rate is then estimated to be @xmath66 where we have roughly assumed @xmath67 .",
    "we therefore get a reheat temperature @xmath68 which is sufficiently high .",
    "we thus expect the flaton to have the following couplings to the mssm is a possible alternative to @xmath69 . ]",
    "@xmath70      in this section we consider the self - couplings of the flaton .",
    "the flaton ( or , in the case of a multi - component flaton , at least one component of the flaton ) should have a negative soft supersymmetry breaking mass squared @xmath71 to drive it away from @xmath13 after thermal inflation .",
    "it will also need a term to stabilise its potential at its vacuum expectation value @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "the simplest possibility is would be an alternative if @xmath50 .",
    "again we assume the displayed case for simplicity .",
    "one might even be able to use the renormalisation group running of @xmath74 to stabilise the potential but then one would not automatically get a value for @xmath18 in the correct range . ]",
    "@xmath75 and this is what we shall assume . in the case of a multi - component flaton this could be interpreted as for example @xmath76 , @xmath77 or a sum of such terms .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for an explicit multi - component example . here , for simplicity",
    ", we will focus on the case of a single component flaton , though it should be born in mind that a multi - component flaton might be preferable from the model building point of view .",
    "we then get the following scalar potential @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "this potential has four degenerate minima with @xmath10 , where @xmath80 for example , for @xmath81 and @xmath82 , we get @xmath83 .",

    "they collapse before the domain walls come to dominate the energy density if the difference in vacuum energies @xmath88 satisfies @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the energy per unit area of the domain walls @xcite . for flaton domain walls @xmath91 and",
    "so we require @xmath92 therefore a term in the superpotential of the form @xmath93 with @xmath94 odd would be sufficient to eliminate the domain walls",
    ". a term with @xmath95 , for example @xmath96 , would reduce the @xmath97 domain walls to @xmath98 domain walls .",
    "note that @xmath99 can be extremely small , and hence have a negligible effect on the dynamics to be discussed in the next section , but still solve the domain wall problem .",
    "another way to avoid a domain wall problem is to gauge the discrete symmetry so that there is really only one vacuum . however , non - trivial anomaly cancellation conditions must be satisfied @xcite . in the case of a single - component flaton with the superpotential of eq .",
    "( [ wti ] ) , and no extra light su(3 ) multiplets , the mixed discrete - su(3 ) anomaly cancellation condition requires @xmath100 to be neutral under any unbroken by hidden sector supersymmetry breaking . ]",
    "anomaly free discrete gauge symmetry .",
    "we therefore can not use a discrete gauge symmetry to remove the @xmath97 domain walls .",
    "however , the anomaly free @xmath97 subgroup of @xmath101 , under which @xmath9 has charge 2 , can be used to gauge away the @xmath98 domain walls left by @xmath96 above .",
    "furthermore , this symmetry is broken down to the standard matter parity of the mssm ( which is equivalent to the r - parity of the mssm ) by the vacuum expectation value of @xmath9 .",
    "in the case of a multi - component flaton the discrete symmetry can be extended to a continuous symmetry which may or may not be gauged . in the case of a continuous global symmetry , for example the peccei - quinn symmetry of ref .",
    "@xcite , the goldstone bosons may prove troublesome @xcite .",
    "one also has more freedom to satisfy the anomaly cancellation conditions in the case of a multi - component flaton .",
    "an extension of the mssm that gives rise to viable thermal inflation , and so does not suffer from a moduli problem , should have the following terms in its superpotential @xmath102",
    "to orientate the reader we will first sketch the basic idea we have in mind before plunging into the details .    the @xmath5-flat direction parametrised by @xmath4 provides an ideal affleck - dine field @xcite . in order for it to behave as an affleck - dine field",
    "we must first get it away from zero .",
    "we therefore require its mass squared at the end of thermal inflation , @xmath103 , to be negative .",
    "it is simplest to assume that it rolls away from zero before @xmath9 does .",
    "however , when @xmath13 the right - handed neutrinos are light , and so @xmath4 is not @xmath104-flat ( it has a quartic term in its potential coming from the superpotential ) .",
    "@xmath4 will thus be stabilised at a modest value .",
    "next @xmath9 will roll away from zero .",
    "the right - handed neutrinos become heavy and so can be integrated out leaving the effective seesaw coupling @xmath105 given in eq .",
    "( [ wseesaw ] ) .",
    "this is now the term that stabilises the @xmath4 direction and we see that it gets smaller , and so the @xmath4 direction gets flatter , as @xmath9 gets larger .",
    "thus , as @xmath9 rolls away from zero , @xmath4 will roll further away from zero .",
    "furthermore , the soft supersymmetry breaking term derived from @xmath105 will correlate the phases of @xmath9 and @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath9 becomes sufficiently large , it will start to feel the basin of attraction of one of the minima of its potential , and so will start curving in towards that minimum , its phase will be roughly determined modulo @xmath106",
    ". the phase of @xmath4 will then be roughly determined modulo @xmath107 by the soft supersymmetry breaking term derived from @xmath105 .",
    "when @xmath41 becomes of order @xmath18 , a cross term from the supersymmetric part of the potential becomes significant and changes the correlation between the phases of @xmath9 and @xmath4 , and so gives the phase of @xmath4 a kick .",
    "the direction of the kick is determined by the parameters in the lagrangian ( this is our @xmath108 violation ) and so gives a non - zero net contribution when averaged over different spatial locations , unlike the rest of the angular momentum that is flying around .",
    "furthermore , as this is happening @xmath109 ( see eq .",
    "( [ wdecay ] ) ) starts to give a significant contribution to the mass of @xmath110 and hence @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath111 this gives the @xmath4 direction an overall positive mass squared ( as it must because @xmath4 has a positive mass squared in the true vacuum ) , and so sends @xmath4 spiralling back in towards zero .",
    "the effective friction on the motion of @xmath9 and @xmath4 coming from the hubble expansion is negligible .",
    "however , the effective mass squareds of both @xmath9 and @xmath4 have been changing sign during the above dynamics and so one would expect them both to decay via broad parametric resonance @xcite .",
    "this will lead to approximately critical damping , and so it seems reasonable to expect that both @xmath9 and @xmath4 will be trapped near their vacuum expectation values essentially immediately after the dynamics described above has occurred .",
    "once they are trapped , parametric resonance becomes less efficient because the mass squareds are now always positive .",
    "@xmath4 s potential near @xmath112 conserves angular momentum , or in other words lepton number , and so @xmath4 s newly acquired lepton number is conserved .",
    "the dynamics outlined above is illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "the decay of the @xmath4 affleck - dine condensate will generate enough partial reheating to restore the electroweak symmetry , and so its lepton number can be converted to baryon number by the usual electroweak effects @xcite .",
    "note that the energy density is still dominated by the flaton and the reheating in the affleck - dine sector has a negligible effect on the now decoupled flaton .",
    "finally , after the temperature has dropped to a few gev , the flaton decay will complete , releasing substantial entropy .",
    "our basic model is @xmath113    the squark fields have no linear terms in their potential and have positive mass squareds .",
    "they will therefore be held at zero apart from thermal fluctuations , and so can be ignored apart from their contribution to the finite temperature effective potential .",
    "the zero temperature potential for the other fields is @xmath114 where the @xmath36 s and the magnitudes of the @xmath37 s are of order @xmath115 .",
    "we assume @xmath116 so that the @xmath5-flat direction parametrised by @xmath4 is also unstable , in addition to the flaton @xmath9 .",
    "note that after @xmath9 acquires its vacuum expectation value @xmath117 , it will give an extra contribution @xmath118 to @xmath110 s mass squared .",

    "we assume @xmath121 so that the @xmath4 direction is stable in the true vacuum .",
    "a rigorous study of the dynamics of this model is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead we will make some simplifying assumptions in order to illustrate how the affleck - dine mechanism might be implemented after thermal inflation and to crudely estimate the resultant baryon asymmetry .",
    "we assume that all fields are initially held at zero by the finite temperature during thermal inflation .",
