    "nonet mesons are interesting composite hadronic objects which have been seriously studied in theoretical and experimental particle physics .",
    "the elementary objects composing mesons are quarks and gluons , and the first principle theory of them is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "then one of our goals is to explain all the information on hadrons from qcd .",
    "the most reliable approach is to consider the discretized version of qcd , called the lattice qcd , whose technologies are developing day by day .",
    "it is , however , still difficult to study hadrons from the first principle , so the approaches by using some effective models become one of our options .    in this paper",
    "we employ the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite being one of frequently used models for the investigations of hadronic particles . the three - flavor model with @xmath0 anomaly  @xcite called kobayashi ",
    "maskawat hooft ( kmt ) term  @xcite successfully describes the nonet meson properties ( for reviews , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the model is not renormalizable , since it contains the higher dimensional operators , four- and six - point fermion interactions .",
    "therefore the model predictions inescapably depend on the regularization procedures .",
    "also , the model shows parameter dependence in each regularization method .",
    "then we have launched a plan to perform the systematical analyses on both the regularization and parameter dependence .",
    "here we are going to study the model with five regularizations : the three - dimensional ( 3d ) and four - dimensional ( 4d ) sharp cutoff schemes , pauli - villars ( pv ) , the proper - time ( pt ) and the dimensional regularizations ( dr ) , as the straightforward extension of the work with the two - flavor model  @xcite .",
    "the 3d cutoff drops the higher momentum contribution in the space direction , which is the most frequently used method due to its simple physical interpretation and nice numerical behavior .",
    "similarly , the 4d cutoff method kills the amplitudes from higher momentum in the four - dimensional euclidean momentum space .",
    "the pv way reduces high momentum contribution by subtracting the amplitudes from virtual heavy particles  @xcite .",
    "the pt method introduces the exponentially dumping factor in the integral , then make divergent loop integrals finite  @xcite .",
    "the dr prescription modifies an integral kernel through changing the space - time dimension so as to make divergent integrals finite .",
    "the model has been examined in detail with various regularizations , see , e.g. , for the 4d  @xcite , pv  @xcite , pt  @xcite and dr  @xcite .",
    "the njl model is regarded as a low energy effective model of qcd ; it is the simplest model to induce dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and often applied to investigate physics near the qcd phase transition . to apply the model to the nonet mesons @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons",
    "may be not light enough compared with the qcd scale . since the model loses validity at higher energy , it should be essential to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the model with the regularization procedures .",
    "it is to be noted that the model has non - negligible parameter dependence even within the same regularization procedure  @xcite .",
    "in particular , some physical quantities , such as the transition temperature on the chiral symmetry breaking , are crucially affected by the model parameters .",
    "moreover , there exists some room for the choice of parameters since input physical quantities for setting the parameters are usually less than the number of the parameters , then several parameter sets are employed depending on working groups  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is also important to test the parameter dependence on the model predictions .",

    "it is also worth mentioning that the curve for the kaon equation is similar to the pion case .",
    "one notes that the equations for the pion present monotonic decrease with respect to @xmath161 , while the result for the @xmath1 mass function exhibits some complex structure .",
    "this comes from the determinantal form of the equation , which is due to the non - vanishing off - diagonal elements in the @xmath162 system as explicitly seen in the appendix a.3 .    the properties with changing @xmath84 on the functions are as follows .",
    "although the slope with respect to @xmath161 , namely @xmath163 , changes according to @xmath84 for @xmath164 , we can always find the solution . on the other hand ,",
    "the change of the slope of @xmath165 becomes important when we try to find the solutions on it ; the absolute value of the slope decreases with increasing @xmath84 as seen from fig .",

    "in this paper we have applied various regularization procedures to the njl model then carried out the meticulous parameter fitting .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is the parameters sets investigated in the same conditions and the input quantities for each regularization .",
    "similar behavior is observed for the model parameters in the 4d , pv and pt .",
    "the model parameters are determined even for extremely high scale beyond the hadronic energy , which , we think , is surely interesting since one can consider the ultraviolet region of the model .",

    "this is as well the interesting feature of the current model .    after setting the model parameters , we evaluated the predicted values , @xmath167 and @xmath125 in each regularization .",
    "we studied whether the predicted quantities can indicate the values close to the experimental observations .",
    "we found that the obtained physical predictions show satisfactory close values to the empirical ones in the 3d , 4d , pv and pt methods , while some quantity has different order in the dr .",
    "this may indicate that the higher order corrections may be important due to the change of an integral kernel with smaller spacetime dimensions in the dimensional regularization .",
