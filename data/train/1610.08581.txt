    "high - mass star formation is one of the most outstanding issues in astronomy .",
    "the formation process of these stars is still obscure compared with low - mass star formation . for example , it is still unclear whether high - mass stars are formed earlier or later relative to low - mass stars .",
    "high - mass stars form in crowded environments ( clusters ) at large distances ( @xmath9 kpc ) , making difficult to resolve individual objects in clusters .",
    "another difficulty is their very short prestellar phase @xcite in spite of the fact that revealing the prestellar phase is very important to investigate high - mass star - forming processes .",

    "filamentary molecular cloud formation has been simulated by colliding flows in the warm neutral medium @xcite .",
    "recent magneto - hydrodynamical simulations suggest that molecular clouds are formed by accretion of hi clouds through thermal instability and their structures are filamentary with axes perpendicular to the mean magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "young stellar object ( yso ) groups are often associated with dense clumps at the convergence of multiple filaments , namely `` hub - filament '' systems @xcite .",
    "the morphology of hub - filament systems can be related to the initial strength and configuration of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these young embedded clusters are particularly useful for investigating the origin of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) . due to their youth",
    ", most protostars have not yet reached their final stellar mass .",
    "the mass distribution of protocluster is often referred to as yso mass function ( ymf ) , which may be altered by subsequent accretion from their parent cores .",
    "actually , different ymf and imf shapes have been reported in irdcs @xcite .",
    "imf studies began with @xcite , who measured the imf from field stars in the solar vicinity and found a power - law form given by @xmath10 with @xmath11 for @xmath12 @xmath8 .",
    "recent observations with high - sensitivity instruments in infrared allow us to identify embedded young clusters and precisely derive the imf .",
    "@xcite derived the orion trapezium cluster imf from the @xmath13-band luminosity function and found @xmath14 above 0.6 @xmath8 .    on studies of the mass function of irdcs",
    ", @xcite have identified clumps ( @xmath15 pc ) and investigated their mass distribution .",
    "they found a slope of 1.76 for masses from 30 to 3000 @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite found a slope of 2.1 above @xmath16 @xmath8 .",
    "these power - law indices are consistent with that of the imf .",
    "it has also been suggested that the cmf is similar in shape to the imf @xcite .",
    "similar shapes of mass function for irdc clumps / cores and stars may suggest that clumps and cores lead to the origin of the imf .",
    "however , if these clumps and cores fragment further , the mass spectrum may steepen and change shape at small core scales . in recent alma observations , @xcite investigated the mass distributions of dense cores in the massive filamentary irdc g28.34@xmath170.06 , clump p1 , with subsolar mass sensitivities .",
    "however , they found a lack of a low - mass population compared with the salpeter imf .",
    "whether the cmf is related with the ymf or imf remains an open question .",
    "more observational data will help to develop a theory for cluster formation .",
    "the relation between the cmf and imf can allow us to improve our understanding of star formation . @xcite have shown a cmf with a single power law and similar to the imf , but scaled to a higher mass by a factor of about 3 .",
    "they suggest that the imf is the direct product of the cmf , which means stars are formed in dense cores one by one at a uniform star - formation efficiency of 30% .",
    "it is quite important to investigate the relation of the cmf , ymf , and imf in high - mass star - forming regions such as hub - filament systems .",
    "the irdc g14.225 - 0.506 ( hereafter g14.2 ) , also known as m17 swex @xcite , is one of the prominent irdcs in the galaxy , which is located southwest of the m17 region ( figure [ map ] ) .",

    "@xcite observed this region in nh@xmath5 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines with the very large array ( vla ) and effelsberg 100 m telescope .",
    "they identified a network of filaments constituting two hub - filament systems ( figure [ map ] ) .",
    "the average rotation temperature in these hub regions was derived to be @xmath18 15 k. @xcite performed a yso survey toward this region by analyzing the _ spitzer _ glimpse and mipsgal data .",
    "they found that the ymf is steeper than the universal imf , indicating a deficit of high - mass ysos .",
    "subsequently , @xcite improved the yso catalog by adding _ chandra x - ray _ and ukidss galactic plane survey observations . as a result , they found a rich population of ysos and x - ray - emittting intermediate - mass pre - main - sequence stars . in spite of the large number of intermediate - mass ysos detected by @xcite and @xcite , massive o - type stars are still absent in g14.2 .    in this paper , we report alma observations of the 3 mm continuum emission .",
    "the alma data also include molecular lines , which will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( chen et al .",

    "g14.2 was observed with the alma 12-m array on 2015 april 25 in the c34 - 2/1 configuration with a total of 37 antennas and with the aca ( 7-m array antennas ) on 2015 april @xmath19 and may 4 with a total of 10 antennas ( cycle 2 program , project id:2013.1.00312.s ; pi : vivien chen ) .",
    "the observed area is shown in figure [ map ] .",
    "the total number of 12-m pointings is 58 in field n and 68 in field s. including time for calibration , the total observing time was about 1.7 hr for the 12-m array .",
    "the observations employed the band 3 ( 103 ghz for continuum ) receivers and the system temperatures ranged from 60 to 90 k. the projected baselines range from 10 to 346 m ( including 7-m and 12-m arrays ) . following equation a5 of @xcite , the largest angular scale ( las ) recoverable by the 12 and 7-m arrays is 26@xmath20 ( @xmath21 pc ) .",
    "the quasar j1733 - 1304 and j1924 - 2914 were observed for bandpass , phase , and amplitude calibration .",
    "flux calibration was performed using neptune and ceres .",
    "the uncertainty of absolute flux calibration is 5% in band 3 according to alma cycle 2 technical handbook .",
    "the reduction and calibration of the data were done with casa version 4.3.1 @xcite in standard manners , and the data were delivered from the east asia alma regional center .",
    "alma 12-m array and aca data sets were combined in the uv plane in casa .",
    "all images of continuum emission were reconstructed with the casa task clean using natural weighting .",
    "the achieved synthesized beams were @xmath22 in field n and @xmath23 in field s. the rms noise level for the combined data is 0.2 mjy beam@xmath24 before the primary beam correction .",
    "the pixel size was set to @xmath25 .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show the 3 mm continuum emission of g14.2 in each observed field without the primary beam correction .",
    "the star signs and green crosses represent the positions of the ysos and x - ray sources , respectively , identified by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 spatial resolution of the _ spitzer_/irac detector is similar to the alma synthesized beam , which facilitates the comparison between the location of cores and ysos .",
    "the brightest regions in each field correspond to the hub - n and hub - s regions identified by @xcite .",
    "the alma images reveal several clumpy structures toward the hub regions .",
    "the peak fluxes of hub - n and hub - s are @xmath27 and @xmath28 mjy beam@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the sensitivity ( 1@xmath29 ) in each field is 0.2 mjy beam@xmath24 , which corresponds to @xmath18 0.28 @xmath8 and a column density of @xmath30 @xmath31 ( @xmath32 g @xmath31 ) at a dust temperature of 17 k ( kinetic temperature of hub - n and hub - s determined in * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , assuming 0.1 pc width of filaments , the sensitivity of line mass corresponds to 52 @xmath8 pc@xmath24 .",
    "@xcite estimated line mass of @xmath33 @xmath8 pc@xmath24 ( average is 170 @xmath8 pc@xmath24 and @xmath34 g @xmath31 ) in the filaments .",
    "therefore , we may be able to identify not only dense cores but also massive filaments .",
    "however , we detect only compact dense cores .",
    "this may be explained by the combined effect of resolving out extended emission from the filaments that have lengths longer than 1 pc ( @xmath35 ) and insufficient sensitivity . in field n , @xcite identified two filaments ( f10-e and f60-n ) converging toward hub - n , while in the alma observations , we identify the highest column density peaks ( cores ) of both filaments . in field",
    "s , we mainly find the emission from the central region of the observed area corresponding to hub - s .              to identify dense cores , we apply the clumpfind method @xcite to the alma 3 mm images with a threshold of 2@xmath29 level ( 2@xmath29 interval steps are also used ) .",
    "this algorithm has been widely used for the identification for clumps and cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we identify a total of 48 cores ( 29 in the northern part and 19 in the southern part ) .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] also show the positions ( crosses and numbers ) of the identified cores .",
    "@xcite showed that the 2@xmath29 noise level is the optimal threshold contour level to recover the clump and/or core structures .",
    "@xcite investigated the dependence of the threshold level from 3 , 5 , and 7@xmath29 and stepsize from 2 to 20@xmath29 on the core properties by testing both two- and three - dimensional clumpfind .",
    "they found that the power - law index of the cmf does not depend on threshold and stepsize compared to the fit uncertainties in the two - dimensional case , where emission is isolated . in our observations ,",
    "the 3 mm continuum emission is relatively isolated and the clumpfind method is reliable to identify cores .",
    "@xcite also showed that the power - law index remains unchanged for thresholds of @xmath36@xmath29 and stepsizes of @xmath37@xmath29 in the orion a cloud .",
    "therefore , we choose the threshold and stepsize of 2@xmath29 . furthermore , we only consider cores having peak intensities above the @xmath38 noise level as robust detections .",
    "the spacing among the dense cores in these filaments is not constant and seems to be shorter when approaching the hub - n region .",
    "we also detect dense cores located in the filaments of f60-s and f60-c3 identified by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite observed 1.3 mm continuum emission toward the hub - n and hub - s regions with the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "their angular resolution is @xmath39 and they revealed some condensations toward these hub regions .",
    "we will compare the alma and sma results in sect .",
    "we identify protostellar and prestellar cores by comparing the dense core positions with : i ) the ysos catalog of @xcite ; ii ) the presence or absence of 24 @xmath2 m emission using the mipsgal survey @xcite ; and iii ) presence of x - ray sources ( taken from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , regardless of ir detection .",
    "assuming yso ages of 0.1 myr @xcite and a width of the velocity dispersion of 0.8 km s@xmath24 , protostars may be able to move away from the core center as 0.4 km s@xmath24 @xmath40 0.1 myr = 0.04 pc @xmath18 4@xmath20 .",
    "the width of the velocity dispersion of protostars is taken from n@xmath3h@xmath4 linewidth for prestellar cores candidates because it has been suggested that the stellar velocity dispersion is comparable to the gas motions @xcite .",
    "if these sources are inside a circle of radius 4@xmath20 from the center position of the core , the core is defined as protostellar .",
    "if no yso is found within 4@xmath20 from the core center , we define the core as a prestellar candidate . following this definition ,",
    "we identify 20 protostellar cores and 28 prestellar cores candidates .",
    "we should note that 0.1 myr age is only applicable to the very youngest stage 0/i ysos but this is valid for most of the cores as they are mainly associated with stage 0/i ysos ( as shown in table [ alma ] ) .",
    "we mention as a caveat that we can not rule out the presence of deeply embedded low - mass protostars .",
    "they could be revealed in the future by deeper ir / x - ray observations or searching for molecular outflows .",
    "the mass of the 3 mm dust cores , @xmath41 , are computed with @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the observed flux in jy , @xmath44 is the distance to the target , @xmath45 is the planck function at a dust temperature @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the dust opacity , and @xmath48 is the dust to gas mass ratio ( assumed to be 100 ) .",

    "the virial parameters of the dense cores are between 0.1 and 1.3 , indicating that the internal support is insufficient and cores are undergoing dynamical collapse . the clumps located in the hubs or massive clumps also present virial parameters of less than 1 .",
    "therefore , clumps may be able to supply material to the cores located in privileged positions of the global gravitational potential .",
    "the cumulative core mass function for the prestellar cores had a power law index ( @xmath7 ) , suggesting that the cmf has similar shape to the salpeter imf .",
    "the prestellar core masses range from 1.5 to 22 @xmath8 .",
    "previous results suggest that massive o - tpye stars has not be produced yet in this region .",
    "we suggested that high - mass stars can be formed in the prestellar cores by accreting a significant amount of the surrounding gas and/or low - mass protostars grow in the cores , fed by the filaments .",
