    "several types of 2d boron nanosheets have been proposed theoretically.@xcite until very recently , a new 2d boron sheet , named as borophene , has been grown successfully on ag(111 ) surfaces under ultrahigh - vacuum conditions and attracted enormous interest due to their extraordinary anisotropic mechanical , electronic , optical and thermal properties.@xcite for example , both experimental and theoretical studies show that borophene shows metallic conduction along _ x _ direction while remains semiconducting along _ y _ direction ( fig .",

    "a cutoff energy of 400 ev was adopted for the plane wave basis set , which yields total energies convergence better than 1 mev / atom .",

    "both the shapes and internal structural parameters of the defective supercells were optimized to reduce the residual force on each atom to less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "moreover , we have allowed spin - polarization for defective systems to prevent possible magnetism .",
    "we begin our investigation by computing the stability of various possible defects in borophene .",
    "we have only considered the charge - neutral defects since the charged defects can not be stable in a metallic system .",

    "we have investigated three kinds of v@xmath39 alighments in a 90-atom supercell : ( i ) uniform distribution , ( ii ) three v@xmath39 clustered to form a trivacancy , and ( iii ) disordered distribution .",

    "it indicates that v@xmath39 tends to uniformly distribute in borophene .",
    "this feature can be understood by the occurrence of charge accumulation around six boron atoms neighboring v@xmath39 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ chg - b - h ] ( a ) . the strong coulomb repulsion between v@xmath39 drives them away from one another , and hence a uniform distribution to minimize the total coulomb interaction .",

    "[ chg - b - h ] that in the region far from the defect , the cylinder - like charge density distribution is parallel to the linear b chains ( along _ x_-direction ) . in contrast , charge density near the bonds in the zigzag chains is rather low , further confirming that the bond strength of the latter is weaker than the former .",
    "the bond lengths of b1-b1 and b2-b2 near v@xmath39 are very close to the bulk value 1.65  .",
    "interestingly , b1 and b2 near v@xmath39 attract each other and the b1-b2 bond length reduces to 1.66  from 1.85  . as can been from fig .",
    "[ chg - b - h ] ( a ) , this reduction leads to a charge transfer from the dangling bonds of b atoms near v@xmath39 to the marginal region near the b - hexagon .",
    "consequently , the bond strength of b1-b2 near v@xmath39 is enhanced and the formation energy of v@xmath39 is thus lowered in compensation .

    "similar to h@xmath40 and c@xmath42 , both c@xmath40 and n@xmath42 increase the anisotropy of poisson s ratio in borophene .",
    "it is noteworthy that besides the species and types of defects , the distribution of defects also affects the mechanical properties of borophene .",
    "we take b vacancy as an example and calculate the elastic properties of three configurations with uniform , clustered and disordered distribution of v@xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the calculated results are presented in table [ tab2 ] and fig .",
    "[ mech - host ] ( c ) and ( d ) . the young s modulus of borophene is decreased by around 6 % along _ x _ direction with a disordered v@xmath42 distribution ; while with a clustered v@xmath42 distribution it is lowered by 20 % compared with the system in which v@xmath42 are uniformly distributed .    _",
    "c. @xmath41>30% in x direction for n@xmath40 and o@xmath42 defects_. interestingly , these two types of defects have negligible effects on the young s modulus along @xmath43 direction .",

    "[ gb ] ( a ) and ( b ) we display two symmetric tilt @xmath15 grain boundaries in borophene and denote them as gb1 and gb2 respectively . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ struct ] , the gb1 and gb2 structures can be made by applying a mirror - reflection operation on the unit cell shadowed in blue and red colors .",
    "the axis of symmetry are _ k _ and _ m _ , the angle @xmath45 of these axis relative to the _",
    "x_-axis are 120@xmath46 and 30@xmath46 respectively .",
    "their gb tilt angles @xmath47 are 120@xmath46 and 60@xmath46 respectively . to describe the stability of gb structure , we define the gb formation energy as    @xmath48    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the total energies of a gb supercell and a supercell of perfect lattice with the same size . @xmath49 is the length of the supercell along the grain boundary .",
    "the calculated gb formation energies are 0.16 ev /  for gb1 and 0.06 ev /  for gb2 . in fig .",
    "[ gb ] , one can see that the valence charge densities accumulate in the region of gb2 while there is no significant change accumulation near the gb1 . as a result ,",
    "the b1-b2 bond strength near gb2 is stronger than that near gb1 . for this reason",
    ", it is expected that the gb2 dominates over gb1 in borophene . to determine the role of gbs on the mechanical properties of borophene , we calculated the youngs s modulus parallel ( @xmath50 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath51 ) to the gb direction . for the gb1 structure , @xmath51=220 ( @xmath45=30@xmath46 ) gpa@xmath3 nm and @xmath50=168 ( @xmath45=120@xmath46 ) gpa@xmath3 nm ; while for gb2 , @xmath51=166 ( @xmath45=120@xmath46 ) gpa@xmath3 nm and @xmath50=204 ( @xmath45=30@xmath46 ) gpa@xmath3 nm .",
    "it should be noted that the gb1 and gb2 directions are perpendicular to each other .",
    "compared to pristine borophene , the youngs s modulus decreases by 9.5 % across @xmath52 axis for gb1 , and by 16.1 % across @xmath53 axis for gb2 .",
    "then , an important question arise : why negligible changes of youngs s modulus are observed along particular directions in these two gb models , both of which are parallel to the @xmath52 axis ? a closer look at fig .",
    "[ gb ] tells that the b1-b2-b1-@xmath3@xmath3@xmath3 like zigzag chain along the @xmath52 axle is parallel to these two directions .",
    "the changes in the structure of zigzag chain are extremely small upon the introduction of gb1 or gb2 .",
    "therefore , both gbs have little effect on the mechanical properties along or cross the gb directions .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the stability of lattice defects as well as their influence on the mechanical anisotropy of borophene using density functional first - principles calculations including van der waals correction .",
    "we find that the formation energies of point defects , b vacancy , interstitial h , interstitial n , substantial o and interstitial o are less than 0.3 ev at room temperature .",
    "in addition , we have also examined two high angle tilt grain boundary structures whose formation energies are as low as 0.16 ev /  and 0.06 ev /  .",
    "these point defects can derease severely the in - plane young s moduli of borophene at high concentraion .",
    "our results demonstrate borophene has high chemical activity and is not stable in the air , and this drawback has to be overcome before its real applications .",
    "it is also found that the substitution of c or n for b can significantly increase the poisson s ratio and the adsorbed h or substitutional b can bring about negative poisson s ratio in borophene .",
    "the two grain boundaries , on the other hand , exert only limited influence .",
