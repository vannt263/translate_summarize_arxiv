    "observations of the sun in x - rays show that the corona is heated to several million degrees , and that magnetic fields play a key role in this heating process ( e.g. vaiana & rosner 1978 ; golub et al .",
    "1980 ; pallavicini et al . 1981 ; kano & tsuneta 1995 , 1996 ; shimizu & tsuneta 1997 ; yoshida & tsuneta 1996 ; falconer et al .",
    "the energy source for this heating must lie in the turbulent convection zone below the photosphere .",
    "the interaction of the magnetic field with convective flows produces two types of magnetic disturbances .",
    "first , the buffeting of magnetic flux tubes by the granulation flow generates transverse mhd waves ( e.g. steiner , knlker & schssler 1994 ) , which propagate upward along the magnetic flux tubes and dissipate their energy in the chromosphere or corona ( see ofman , klimchuk & davila 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "second , in coronal loops the random motions of the footpoints produce twisting and braiding of coronal field lines , which generates field - aligned dc electric currents that can be dissipated resistively ( parker 1972 , 1983 ; tucker 1973 ; rosner et al . 1978 ;",
    "sturrock & uchida 1981 ; heyvaerts & priest 1984 ; van ballegooijen 1985 , 1986 , 1990a ; milano , gomez & martens 1997 ) .",
    "the main difference between these processes is that plasma inertia plays a key role in mhd wave propagation but is not important for the dynamics field - aligned currents .",
    "therefore , magnetic heating mechanisms can be crudely classified as either wave - heating or current - heating mechanisms ( for reviews of coronal heating theory , see narain & ulmschneider 1990 , 1996 ; zirker 1993 ) .",
    "the relationship between coronal heating and the dynamics of photospheric magnetic structures is not well understood .",
    "van ballegooijen ( 1985 , 1986 ) proposed that the slow twisting and braiding of coronal field lines by horizontal footpoint motions leads to a _ cascade of magnetic energy _ within coronal loops .",
    "the heating rate predicted by this model is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the coronal field strength , @xmath2 is the loop length , and @xmath3 is the `` diffusion constant '' describing the random walk of photospheric flux elements .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the typical velocity of the magnetic elements , and @xmath6 is the velocity coherence time .",
    "observations of the spreading of active regions indicate that @xmath3 is in the range 150 to 425 @xmath7 ( devore et al . 1985 ) , but such values of @xmath3 yield coronal heating rates which are a factor @xmath8 too small compared to observed radiative and conductive loss rates ( van ballegooijen 1986 ) .",
    "we suggest there may exist short - period motions with velocities of 1 - 2 km / s which contribute to coronal heating but do _ not _ contribute to the spreading of active region flux on time scales of days to months ( i.e. , the motions can not be described by a `` random walk '' ) .",
    "short - period motions of magnetic elements have indeed been observed ( e.g. berger & title 1996 ) , but the characteristics of such motions are not well understood , and it is unclear whether the velocities are sufficient to explain the observed coronal heating .    a number of authors have developed three - dimensional simulation models of the magnetic structure and heating of solar coronal loops ( e.g. van ballegooijen 1988 , 1990b ; mikic , schnack & van hoven 1989 ; longcope & sudan 1994 ; hendrix et al .",
    "1996 ; galsgaard & nordlund 1996 ) . in these simulations",
    "an initially uniform field connecting two parallel plates is considered ( the plates represent the photosphere at the two ends of a coronal loop ) .",
    "the footpoints at the boundary plates are subjected to a series of randomly phased , sinusoidal flows patterns .",
    "the flows are incompressible , so that the component of magnetic field perpendicular to each boundary plate remains uniform .",
    "this is obviously not a good model of the actual conditions in the solar photosphere .",
    "observations indicate that the photospheric magnetic field is highly intermittent , consisting of discrete flux elements with nearly field - free gas in between ( e.g. title , tarbell & topka 1987 ; title et al .",
    "the solar convection plays a key role in producing these flux elements , which are mainly located at the boundaries between granulation cells .",
    "this concentration of flux into discrete elements probably has important consequences for coronal heating : if the magnetic field consists of a bundle of topologically distinct flux tubes , then the random motions of these flux tubes in the photosphere will create _ tangential discontinuities _ at the interfaces between the tubes in the corona ( parker 1972 ; glencross 1975 , 1980 ; rosner et al .",
    "1978 ; sturrock & uchida 1981 ; dmoulin & priest 1997 ) . clearly , to understand where and how the corona is heated , it is necessary to study the dynamics of photosheric flux elements and to develop coronal heating models which take the presence of such flux elements into account .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the first part of this problem , namely , the dynamics of magnetic flux elements in the photosphere and chromosphere .",
    "we analyze observations of g - band bright points obtained at the swedish vacuum solar telescope ( svst ) on la palma , and derive the autocorrelation function describing the temporal variations of the bright point velocity .",
    "we find that the velocity changes on a time scale of about 100 s. we develop an empirical model of the granulation flow and simulate the horizontal motions of flux tubes , assuming they are passively advected by the granulation flow . by comparing the results of these simulations with the observed spatial distributions and velocities of g - band bright points ,",
    "we show that this passive advection model is in reasonable agreement with the observations . finally , we use potential - field modeling to extrapolate the magnetic and velocity fields to larger heights ( up to 1500 km in the chromosphere ) .",
    "the results indicate that the spreading of the flux tubes with height and their interactions with each other produce plasma flows in the chromosphere with velocities of several km / s , much faster than the velocities of the underlying photospheric flux tubes .",
    "this suggests that the coronal heating rate can be significantly enhanced by the three - dimensional geometry of the flux tubes in the photosphere and chromosphere .",
    "observations of the sun with high spatial resolution show network bright points ( muller 1983 , 1985 , 1994 ; muller & keil 1983 ; muller & roudier 1984 , 1992 ) and `` filigree '' ( dunn & zirker 1973 ; mehltretter 1974 ; berger et al .",
    "1995 ) , which are small bright features located within the intergranular lanes .",
    "the bright points and filigree are seen in the wings of strong spectral lines such as h@xmath9 and ca ii h & k , in lines formed in the photosphere , and even at continuum wavelengths ( with reduced contrast ) .",
    "the widths of these structures is 100 to 200 km , at the limit of resolution of ground - based solar telescopes .",
    "the bright points are associated with regions of strong magnetic field ( chapman & sheeley 1968 ; title , tarbell & topka 1987 ; simon et al .",
    "1988 ; title et al .",
    "1989 , 1992 ; keller 1992 ) and correspond to magnetic flux tubes of kilogauss field strength that stand nearly vertically in the solar atmosphere ( stenflo 1973 ; stenflo & harvey 1985 ; sanchez almeida & martinez pillet 1994 ; see review by solanki 1993 ) .",
    "the granules near network bright points are smaller and more numerous than near a normal intergranular space ( muller , roudier & hulot 1989 ) .",
    "the filigree produce abnormal granulation patterns ( dunn & zirker 1973 ) and appear to be chains of bright points which fill the intergranular lanes .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of bright points has been studied by a number of authors .",
    "muller ( 1983 ) found that facular points on the quiet sun are predominantly located in patches at the periphery of supergranule cells , indicating that the magnetic elements are advected by the supergranular flow .",
    "the bright points always first appear in the dark spaces _ at the junction of several granules _",
    ", never inside a granule nor in the space between only two granules .",
    "as the granulation pattern evolves , the bright points remain in the intergranular spaces throughout their lifetime , but not necessarily at the junction of several granules like at the time of their first appearance .",
    "new bright points have a tendency to appear adjacent to existing points , and 15 % of the bright points seem to split into two points which move apart until a separation of 1 to 1.5 arcsec is reached .",
    "muller et al . ( 1994 ) measured velocities of 29 isolated bright points and found a mean speed of 1.4 km / s . strous ( 1994 ) studied bright points in a growing active region . using line - center images",
    "taken in fe i 5576  , he found velocities between 0.26 km / s and 0.62 km / s .",
    "berger & title ( 1996 ) measured velocities of 1 to 5 km / s for g - band bright points in the `` moat '' around a sunspot ; they showed that the motions are constrained to the intergranular lanes and are primarily driven by the evolution of the granulation pattern .",
    "they found that the bright points continually split and merge , with a mean time between splitting events of few hundred seconds .",
    "berger et al . ( 1998 ) observed a similar rapid splitting and merging of bright points in an enhanced network region .    in the present paper we use observational data from the svst on la palma to derive time - dependent granulation flow fields and to simulate the horizontal motions of magnetic elements in the photosphere .",
    "the data were collected on 1995 october 5 between 10:57 and 12:08 ut .",
    "observations were made simultaneously with two ccd cameras : one used a 12  bandpass interference filter with a center wavelength of 4305  ( g band ) , and the other used a 54  bandpass filter with a center wavelength of 4686  .",
    "frame selection was based on the g band images : only the three best frames in each 20 s evaluation period were retained for analysis .",
    "both cameras were equipped with phase - diversity beam splitters which put two images on each ccd with a difference in focus position .",
    "the images were corrected for seeing effects using partitioned phase - diverse speckle restoration , and were carefully coaligned using image destretching techniques . the data were space - time filtered to remove the effects of solar p - mode oscillations .",
    "the result is a time series of 180 images with very high spatial resolution covering a period of about 70 min .",
    "the image scale is 0.083 arcsec / pixel and the mean time between frames @xmath10 = 23.5 s.    the field - of - view ( fov ) is a 29 by 29 arcsec area near solar disk center containing an enhanced network region .",
    "this region is the same as the `` network fov '' described by lfdahl et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and we refer to their paper for a detailed description the observation and image restoration procedures .",
    "the data used here are in essence an early version of these data ( lfdahl 1996 ) .",
    "berger et al . (",
    "1998 ) analyzed `` the network fov '' , where magnetic elements are seen as bright points with high contrast in the g band ( which includes the molecular bandhead of ch ) and with reduced contrast in the 4686  band ( which contains continuum and many absorption lines ) .",
    "the solar granulation shows up with nearly equal contrast in both types of images .",
    "the bright points are generally located in the dark intergranular lanes .",
    "subtraction of the g band and 4686  images yields a difference image which shows the bright points and surrounding diffuse emission with unprecedented clarity .",
    "berger et al . identified bright points using a threshold technique applied to these difference images .",
    "they define a `` magnetic region '' as the area within their fov which is covered by bright points at any time during the movie . using local correlation tracking ( lct ) with subfields of 0.4 arcsec",
    ", they measure a mean granulation flow velocity of 0.641 km / s inside this magnetic region and 0.997 km / s in the surrounding quiet region .",
    "they also followed the motions of bright points using an object tracking technique , and found that the bright points have a broad velocity distribution which peaks at 0.1 km / s but extends to several km / s ; the mean velocity is 0.815 km / s .",
    "the bright points continually split up and merge ; the average time between merging and splitting events is 220 s. some objects can be followed for the entire 70 min duration of the movie .    following berger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we construct a time series of `` magnetic '' difference images by subtracting the 4686  continuum images from the corresponding g - band images : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are horizontal coordinates on the sun , @xmath14 is the time , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are intensities normalized to the mean intensity in non - magnetic areas of the frame .",
    "examples of such difference images are shown in figures [ magn_image]a and [ magn_image]b ( frames 40 and 177 of the time sequence ) .",
    "note that the bright points form linear structures which fill the intergranular lanes and sometimes surround the granules on all sides .",
    "we also construct a time series of magnetic `` masks '' by smoothing the @xmath17 images in space and time ( running average over 5 frames ) and applying a @xmath18 threshold .",
    "these masks define the general areas where the bright points are located .",
    "one of the difficulties in tracking bright points is that they often have complex shapes , so that their positions are not always well defined .",
    "moreover , the bright features in g - band images continually split up and merge , causing sudden changes in position as determined using object tracking techniques ( berger _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . to overcome these problems",
    ", we developed a new tracking technique which uses small but finite - size `` corks '' as tracers of bright points .",
    "the corks are small circular disks which move about on the photospheric plane but are not allowed to overlap each other .",
    "each bright feature in the magnetic image is associated with a cluster of such corks .",
    "the corks are advected by an artificial flow field @xmath19 which drives the corks to the brightest regions in the magnetic image ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "clusters of corks collect at the bright points and follow the bright points as the brightness pattern evolves .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the shapes of the cork clusters can adjust themselves to the actual shape of the bright points .    in the present study we used 1400 corks with radii @xmath21 = 60 km , equal to the pixel size of the data set .",
    "the positions of the corks are advanced with a time step equal to one half of the average time between frames in the movie , but the results are saved only for whole frames ( @xmath22 s ) . the correction for cork overlap",
    "is performed iteratively at each time step : we first search for partially overlapping corks ( i.e. , pairs of corks with separations less than @xmath23 ) and for each overlapping pair we correct the positions by moving the two corks apart in opposite directions along their separation line until the corks just touch each other .",
    "we then repeat the search to check whether any new overlapping pairs occurred as a result of the previous corrections , and if necessary we correct the positions again .",
    "the process is repeated until there are no overlapping corks before proceeding to the next time step .",
    "the initial positions of the corks are chosen at random from within the magnetic mask for frame 3 ( the first frame for which such a time - averaged mask can be computed ) and we follow the corks until frame 177 .",
    "the intensity of the bright points varies with time , and some bright points fade away , leaving the associated corks with nowhere to go .",
    "therefore , on every fifth frame we remove corks which fall outside the magnetic mask ( see  2 ) and reinsert new corks at other random locations within the mask .",
    "typically about 5% of the 1400 corks are replaced every fifth frame , and the total number of corks present over the entire time interval is 3827 .",
    "hence , the corks have lifetimes @xmath24 which are multiples of 5 frames and range from 5 to 175 frames ( here @xmath25 is the cork index : @xmath26 ) . in this way we obtain cork positions @xmath27 and",
    "velocities @xmath28 as function of time for each cork , where @xmath29 is the time index ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "these cork velocities represent measurements of the velocities of the bright points .",
    "figures [ magn_corks]a and [ magn_corks]b show the spatial distributions of corks for frames 40 and 177 plotted over the corresponding granulation image . note that the corks form dense clusters located in the intergranular lanes .",
    "comparison with figures [ magn_image]a and [ magn_image]b shows that the spatial distribution of the corks closely resembles the distribution of the bright points .",
    "the random motions of the photospheric flux tubes produce mhd waves and other disturbances that propagate into the upper solar atmosphere and contribute to chromospheric and coronal heating .",
    "models of wave generation ( e.g. choudhuri , dikpati & banerjee 1993 ) predict that short - period motions are much more effective in generating waves than long - period motions . therefore , it is of interest to determine the velocity autocorrelation function which describes how the velocity of a bright point varies with time .",
    "the autocorrelation of velocity @xmath31 over a time delay @xmath32 is given by : @xmath33 and similar for @xmath34 . by averaging these functions for all corks with lifetimes @xmath35",
    ", we obtain mean autocorrelations @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "figure [ magn_auto ] shows the mean autocorrelations @xmath36 and @xmath37 as functions of delay time @xmath38 for @xmath39 s. note that the autocorrelation decreases monotonically with time , i.e. , there is no evidence for any specific periodicities in the bright point motion .",
    "the autocorrelation decreases rapidly with time over the first few frames and more slowly thereafter .",
    "the initial decrease is probably due to measurement noise , but the more gradual decrease on a time scale of a few hundred seconds is probably real .",
    "we find that the data can be fit with the following function : @xmath40 , \\label{eq : cor}\\ ] ] where the first term represents the measurement noise , the second term describes random motions with a correlation time @xmath6 = 100 s , and the last term describes motions with a correlation times exceeding 1000 s. the effectiveness of the random motions in generating of flux tube waves will be discussed  6 .",
    "the measurement errors represented by the first term in equation ( [ eq : cor ] ) are probably due to telescope guiding errors and residual seeing effects . to reduce these effect",
    ", we computed mean cork velocities averaged over blocks of 5 frames ( 118 s ) .",
    "the average of these mean velocities is @xmath41 = -57 m / s and @xmath42 = + 13 m / s , and the standard deviation is @xmath43 = 379 m / s and @xmath44 = 385 m / s .",
    "note that the averaging time is comparable to the time scale of the random motions , therefore the above values likely underestimate the true velocities on the sun . clearly , to measure bright point velocities more accurately , improved observations with shorter sampling times ( @xmath45 s ) are required .",
    "models of the interaction of magnetic fields with convection show that the magnetic flux tubes are expelled by the granulation flow ( e.g. schmidt et al .",
    "convection models without magnetic field indicate that at depths greater than a few 100 km the convection consists of cool plumes of rapidly downflowing plasma embedded in a connected region of warm gentle upflow ( stein & nordlund 1989 , 1994 ; chan & sofia 1986 ; cattaneo et al .",
    "1991 ; rast et al .",
    "the plumes are usually located below the vertices of the intergranular lanes visible at the solar surface .",
    "magneto - convection simulations predict that the magnetic field is swept into these downflow plumes ( nordlund & stein 1989 , 1990 ; stein , brandenbrug & nordlund 1992 ; nordlund et al .",
    "1992 ) . in weak field regions ( average magnetic flux density @xmath46 g ) the magnetic field will likely be concentrated into discrete vertical flux tubes located within the downflow plumes , consistent with observations of network bright points at vertices of intergranular lanes . on the other hand , in strong field regions ( @xmath47 g )",
    "the magnetic field may fill the intergranular lanes , acting as rigid walls which make the connected downflows extend much deeper than in the field - free case ( stein , brandenburg & nordlund 1992 ) .",
    "the photospheric flux elements are driven by granulation flows which push the elements into the intergranular lanes .",
    "( 1998 ) used local correlation tracking ( lct ) to derive horizontal flow fields from a time series of granulation intensity images .",
    "a disadvantage of this lct technique is that it is insensitive to stationary flows , and therefore can not detect the more or less steady flow of plasma from the centers of granules to the intergranular lanes .",
    "lct can detect such flows only if they are very fragmented and the spatial resolution is sufficient to resolve the fragments as they are advected from the center of the granule to the boundary . in this paper",
    "we use a different technique which does not require the presence of such fine - scale structures .",
    "we derive a model of the granulation flow velocity @xmath48 $ ] in the photosphere .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that the vertical component of vorticity is small , so that the velocity can be approximated by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the flow potential .",
    "we assume that @xmath51 is well correlated with the granulation intensity : @xmath52 is positive in the bright granules and negative in the dark intergranular lanes , hence @xmath53 represents the radial outflow from the cell centers to the lanes .",
    "the granulation intensity @xmath54 is defined by removing the bright points from the 4686  image as much as possible ; this is done by subtracting a multiple of the `` magnetic '' image from the 4686  ] where @xmath55 .",
    "we assume that the acceleration of the photospheric plasma is given by : @xmath56 where the first term on the rhs describes the driving of the flow by horizontal temperature gradients ( the temperature is assumed to be proportional to @xmath57 ) , the second term describes the effects of turbulent viscosity ( @xmath58 = 70 @xmath59 ) , and the third `` frictional '' term describes the decay of the velocity of a granule after the granule has disappeared from the temperature field ( decay time @xmath60 = 300 s ) . inserting equation ( [ eq : grad ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath61 where the constant is chosen such that the average of @xmath52 over the image vanishes at all times .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath62 is determined by comparing the computed flow velocities with those found in the 3d granulation simulations of stein & nordlund ( 1994 ) . at a depth of 40 km in stein & nordlund s model the irrotational component of horizontal velocity ( i.e. , after removal of vortical flows ) has an rms value @xmath63 @xmath64 1.60 km / s .",
    "we adjusted @xmath62 to obtain essentially the same value in the present model .",
    "figure [ sim_vect ] shows the velocity in a subarea of frame 40 as computed with the above 2d model .",
    "note that the velocity changes rapidly across the intergranular lanes .",
    "figure [ sim_div]a shows the divergence of the velocity for the full frame . for comparison , figure [ sim_div]b shows the divergence of horizontal velocity at a depth of 40 km as derived from the 3d simulations of stein & nordlund ( 1994 ) . note that the intergranular lanes are very narrow in both cases . in our 2d model",
    "the width @xmath65 of the lanes is controlled by the `` viscosity '' parameter @xmath58 , and is given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the velocity of the converging flows on either side of the lane ( typically @xmath68 km / s ) . with @xmath58 = 70 @xmath59 we predict @xmath69 km , but due to numerical diffusion the lanes in our model are actually somewhat wider , @xmath70 km .",
    "we use the above granulation flow field to simulate the horizontal motions of magnetic elements in the photosphere .",
    "the magnetic field is modeled as a collection of cylindrical flux tubes which stand vertically in the solar atmosphere and each have a radius @xmath21 = 60 km .",
    "each flux tube is a rigid structure which is _ passively advected _ by the granulation flow , i.e. , we neglect possible effects of the anchoring of the flux tubes at larger depth .",
    "the rigidity of the flux tubes simulates the fact that the magnetic field strength @xmath71 can not exceed the value for equipartition of the magnetic pressure with the external gas pressure in the lower photosphere .",
    "assuming @xmath71 = 1500 g and @xmath21 = 60 km , each flux tube has a magnetic flux of @xmath72 mx .",
    "the flux tubes behave like rigid `` corks '' which float on the granulation flow : converging flows produce densely packed cork clusters which represent larger magnetic elements with shapes determined by the flow .",
    "the motions of 1400 corks are followed from frame 3 to frame 177 , which corresponds to about 7 granulation lifetimes .",
    "the procedure for dealing with overlapping corks is the same as in  3 , and the initial positions of the corks are also the same , i.e. , the corks are initially located at the positions of the bright points .",
    "however , in the present case we do not replace corks as they move away from the bright points ; all 1400 corks keep their identity for the full duration of the simulation .",
    "figure [ sim_corks ] shows the cork positions for frames 40 and 177 superposed on the corresponding convective intensity patterns .",
    "note that the corks collect predominantly in clusters at the vertices where several intergranular lanes intersect .",
    "linear structures extend from these clusters out into the intergranular lanes .",
    "this is due to the narrow width of the velocity lanes , which prevents the corks from all collecting at the vertex points .",
    "in contrast , in models with broader lanes ( not shown ) most of the magnetic elements collect in a few large clusters . although the present model does not reproduce the exact locations of all bright points in the final frame , the qualitative agreement between observed and predicted patterns is quite good ( compare figures [ sim_corks ] and [ magn_corks ] ) .",
    "in particular , the model shows linear structures similar to the observed filigree .",
    "the magnetic flux tubes on the sun expand with increasing height in the photosphere , and above some height the neighboring flux tubes merge to fill the available volume .",
    "this `` merging '' of the flux tubes generally occurs in the chromosphere at a height about 1000 km or less ( depending on the horizontal distance between the flux tubes ) .",
    "since the magnetic field is nearly `` frozen into '' the plasma , the horizontal motions of the photospheric flux tubes induce plasma flows in the chromosphere and above . in this section , we use a potential - field model to compute the velocity field at a height of 1500 km in the chromosphere above the observed region .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that the magnetic field _ inside _",
    "the flux tubes remains close to a potential field at all times , i.e. , we ignore the effects of field - aligned electric currents on the magnetic structures below 1500 km height .",
    "the magnetic field is described as a superposition of fields from discrete point sources : @xmath73 the sources are located at positions @xmath74 $ ] , where @xmath75 = 160 km is the depth of the sources below the photosphere ( the same for all sources ) .",
    "each source is the sum of a monopole and a ( vertically oriented ) dipole : @xmath76 where @xmath77^{1/2}$ ] is the distance to a source , @xmath78 = 1000 km is the canopy height for a single source , and we assume that all sources have the same strength and polarity .",
    "we define tube - like structures by tracing magnetic field lines downward from a height of 1500 km , i.e. we ignore the `` closed '' magnetic structures in between these flux tubes .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the flux tubes are embedded in a field - free gas .",
    "the frozen - in condition implies @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the plasma velocity and @xmath81 is the electric field .",
    "the latter can be written as : @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the electric potential , and @xmath84 is the electric field due to a single source : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the source velocity .",
    "the condition @xmath87 yields : @xmath88 the right hand side can be computed directly from the known positions and velocities of the magnetic sources , hence the electric potential @xmath89 at height @xmath90 = 1500 km can be determined by numerical integration along the field lines .",
    "we use the boundary condition @xmath91 = 0 at the photosphere . by tracing five neighboring field lines which are anchored in the same source ,",
    "we compute the partial derivatives @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which yields the horizontal components of electric field , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , at height @xmath90 [ see equation ( [ eq : elec ] ) ] .",
    "the vertical component @xmath96 is found from the condition @xmath87 , and the velocity is computed from @xmath97 = @xmath98 . here",
    "we assume arbitrarily that the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .    to illustrate the method we first consider the case with only two magnetic sources .",
    "the sources are located at @xmath99 = @xmath100 km and @xmath101 = @xmath102 km , so that there is a single magnetic null point located at a height @xmath103 = 329 km above the midpoint between the two sources ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "figure [ two_lines ] ( plate ) shows a perspective view of the magnetic field lines for this case .",
    "note that the field lines in @xmath105 are connected to source 1 while those in @xmath106 are connected to source 2 ; the plane @xmath107 is the _ separatrix surface _ between the two flux tubes .",
    "the field lines within this separatrix surface fan out more or less radially from the null point , i.e. , the separatrix surface is a _",
    "fan plane_. field lines which approach the null point along the @xmath12 direction are diverted in all directions parallel to the fan plane .",
    "now assume that source 1 is moving with velocity 1 km / s in the @xmath108 direction , and source 2 is moving with the same velocity in the @xmath109 direction , i.e. perpendicular to the line connecting the two sources .",
    "figure [ two_vel ] shows the predicted chromospheric velocity at height 1500 km for this case .",
    "note that the velocities directly above the sources are indeed about 1 km / s , but as we approach the separatrix surface ( @xmath107 ) the magnitude of the velocity increases dramatically .",
    "apparently , the movement of the flux tubes past each other produces large velocities near the separatrix plane .",
    "simulations with higher resolution indicate that @xmath110 increases without bound as @xmath111 .",
    "this effect is due to the 3d geometry of the magnetic field near the null point : the motion of the magnetic sources causes field lines to sweep past the null point in the @xmath13 direction , producing rapid motion of field lines in the vicinity of the fan plane . in appendix",
    "a we show that the functional dependence of the velocity near the separatrix surface is determined by the eigenvalues of the magnetic gradient tensor at the null point .    in the present model we assume for simplicity that @xmath91 = 0 , which implies that _ the flux tubes exhibit no rotational motion about their vertical axes_. as two neighboring flux tube move relative to each other",
    ", the line connecting the two flux tubes rotates with time , but this rotation is not compensated by a corresponding rotation of the individual flux tubes .",
    "this leads to enhanced velocities at the separatrix surface as discussed above . of course",
    ", if the flux tubes were to rotate at the same rate as their relative motion , then the chromospheric velocity enhancement at the separatrix plane would not occur .",
    "hence , if there are only two flux tubes , it is possible to avoid such velocity enhancements by a suitable choice of rotation rate of the individual flux tubes .",
    "however , on the sun there are _ multiple _ flux tubes which randomly move among each other .",
    "each flux tube has several neighbors , and the different lines connecting a flux tube with its neighbors generally rotate at different rates .",
    "therefore , in general it is not possible to eliminate all chromospheric velocity enhancements by suitable choice of the flux tube s rotation rate .",
    "we now use the above method to predict the magnetic field and velocity field above the observed network region .",
    "the positions of the magnetic sources are taken from the simulation of  4 .",
    "figure [ sim_lines ] ( plate ) shows a perspective view of field lines for a small area in frame 40 .",
    "the horizontal size of the region is 3000 km , and its location within frame 40 is indicated by the white box in figure [ sim_corks]a .",
    "note that each field line can be traced to a particular cork at @xmath112 .",
    "figure [ sim_vel]a shows the horizontal component of velocity in the chromosphere ( @xmath90 = 1500 km ) as computed with the above method .",
    "figure [ sim_vel]b shows the boundaries between different flux tubes at this height , i.e. , each domain is connected to one particular `` cork '' at @xmath112 .",
    "note that the predicted chromospheric velocities are several km / s , much larger than the assumed velocities of the magnetic sources below the photosphere .",
    "this amplification is partly due to the spreading of the flux tubes with height , which enhances the rotational motion of neighboring flux tubes around each other ( van ballegooijen 1986 ) .",
    "however , figure [ sim_vel]b shows that the largest velocities occur near separatrix surfaces where neighboring flux tubes slide past each other .",
    "therefore , most of the effect is due to the magnetic null points , which enhance the velocities of field lines which pass in their vicinity .",
    "in fact , in some regions the field - line velocities are so large that the plasma inertia can not be neglected and the potential - field model breaks down . clearly , to obtain an accurate description of such flows a more realistic mhd model of interacting flux tubes is needed .",
    "the simulations in  4 show that the observed velocities and spatial distribution of the g - band bright points are consistent with passive advection by the granulation flow , i.e. , we find no evidence for deep - seated flows different from the observed granulation pattern . to reproduce the observed `` filigree '' structures , we had to take into account that the photospheric flux elements are nearly incompressible ( @xmath113 g ) and that the intergranular lanes are very narrow ( @xmath114 km ) .",
    "in contrast , in models with broader lanes most of the magnetic elements collect in a few large clusters at the vertices where several lanes intersect .",
    "therefore , the observed filigree structures provide indirect evidence for the existence of narrow intergranular lanes with widths @xmath115 km .",
    "note that the present granulation flow model is based on the _ observed _ granulation pattern and therefore includes the effects of the magnetic field on the granulation flow ( longer lifetime of granules ; reduced cell size ) .",
    "three - dimensional models of solar convection ( e.g. stein & nordlund 1994 ) show the presence of small - scale vortical flows within the intergranular lanes on scales @xmath115 km .",
    "such small - scale flows likely play an important role in breaking up the `` filigree '' into distinct magnetic elements , as is observed in high - resolution g - band images .",
    "indeed , bright points sometimes exhibit rotational motions about each other ( berger & title 1996 ) . in the present paper we neglected the vorticity of the granulation flow and its effects on the dynamics of flux tubes .",
    "the reason is that the observational data do not provide information about the vorticity of granulation flows on small spatial scales .",
    "using correlation tracking , it is possible to measure vorticity on length scales of several granules ( e.g. wang et al . 1995 ) , but such large - scale vorticity probably has little effect on the small - scale structure and dynamics of magnetic elements within the intergranular lanes .",
    "clearly , future modeling of flux tube dynamics will need to take vortical flows into account , and work along these lines is in progress ( nordlund & stein , in preparation ) . to measure small - scale vortical flows directly ( other than by tracking magnetic elements ) will require observations with much higher spatial resolution than are presently available .",
    "how effective are the observed motion in generating mhd waves ? in  3",
    "we show that the autocorrelation function of the bright point velocity is approximately given by : @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 s. the velocity power spectrum is obtained by taking the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function : @xmath119 hence , most of the power is contained in frequencies @xmath120 @xmath121 rad / s .",
    "this is significantly less than the acoustic cutoff frequency in the photosphere , which is given by @xmath122 = @xmath123 rad / s , where @xmath124 km / s is the sound speed and @xmath125 km is the pressure scale height .",
    "therefore , it is doubtful that the observed motions are very effective in generating longitudinal tubes waves , which are evanescent at these frequencies .",
    "a number of authors have proposed that the corona is heated by _ transverse _",
    "tube waves ( hollweg 1984 ; choudhuri , auffret & priest 1993 ; choudhuri , dikpati & banerjee 1993 ) .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1994 ) measure a mean speed of network bright points of 1.4 km / s and conclude that there is sufficient energy in these motions to heat the quiet corona .",
    "however , it is not clear that the observed velocity is entirely due to transverse waves : part of the mean velocity must be due to long - period motions which are not effective in generating transverse tube waves .",
    "the cutoff frequency for tranverse tube waves is given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the acceleration of gravity , @xmath128 is the ratio of gas pressure and magnetic pressure , and the thin flux tube approximation has been used ( spruit 1981 ) . using @xmath129 = 0.3 , we find @xmath130 rad / s .",
    "if we assume that only the high frequency modes with @xmath131 can generate transverse waves , then the amplitude of these waves is given by : @xmath132 , \\ ] ] which yields @xmath133 km / s .",
    "the energy flux in such waves is given by @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the mass density , and @xmath136 is the alfvn speed . using @xmath137 @xmath138 for the density within the tubes in the low photosphere , we find that the energy transported by these waves per unit magnetic flux is @xmath139 = @xmath140 = @xmath141 @xmath142 . hence , in plage regions with magnetic flux density @xmath143 g",
    ", we expect a mean energy flux @xmath144 @xmath145 .",
    "this is comparable to the observed radiative and conductive losses from the corona above plage regions ( withbroe and noyes 1977 ) .",
    "extrapolations of magnetic and velocity fields to larger heights ( see  5 ) show that the chromospheric velocity can be locally much larger than the horizontal velocities of the flux tubes in the photosphere .",
    "this enhancement is due to the 3d geometry of the flux tubes and the dynamics of field lines near magnetic null points where different flux tubes interact .",
    "this result may have important implications for models of coronal heating .",
    "first , the coronal heating rate varies as the _ square _ of the footpoint velocity , hence the velocity enhancement found here could significantly increase the coronal heating rate .",
    "second , the enhanced velocities are localized near separatrix surfaces , and therefore could affect the way in which electric currents build up at such surfaces ( glencross 1975 , 1980 ; dmoulin & priest 1997 ) .",
    "finally , the predicted chromospheric velocities are so large that plasma inertia can not be neglected ; quasi - static potential - field models can not accurately describe the flows that occur where neighboring flux tubes interact .",
    "clearly , to understand how magnetic energy is stored and dissipated in the corona , a more realistic _ dynamical _ model of interacting flux tubes is needed .",
    "the observational data used in this study were kindly provided by r. a. shine of lockheed - martin , and were obtained at the svst , which is operated by the swedish royal academy of sciences at the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchados of the instituto de astrophysca de canarias ( iac ) .",
    "we thank t. e. berger for many useful discussions regarding his analysis of these data .",
    "this work was supported by nasa grant nagw-2545 at the center for astrophysics .",
    "we introduce a coordinate reference frame @xmath146 with the origin located at a magnetic null point and the axes aligned with the eigenvectors of the magnetic gradient tensor , @xmath147 .",
    "then , apart from a constant factor , the potential field near the null point can be written as : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is a dimensionless parameter describing the ratio of @xmath12 and @xmath13 eigenvalues .",
    "we assume that @xmath149 lies in the range @xmath150 , so that @xmath107 is the fan plane .",
    "now suppose that the plasma velocity is constant in time and is parallel to the fan plane : @xmath151 .",
    "the induction equation @xmath152 yields @xmath153 = @xmath154 , which has the solution @xmath155 . since @xmath156 , the velocity @xmath110 increases without bound as we approach the fan plane ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "this singularity is not present in the two - dimensional case ( @xmath157 ) .",
