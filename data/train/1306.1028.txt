    "testing statistical hypotheses is an important step in building statistical models .",
    "often it is checked whether the data deviate significantly from a null model . in point process statistics , typical null models",
    "are complete spatial randomness ( csr ) , independent marking or some fitted model . unlike in classical statistics , where null models are typically represented by a single hypothesis",
    ", the hypotheses in spatial statistics have a spatial dimension and therefore a multiple character .",
    "usually a summary function @xmath2 is employed in the test , where @xmath0 is a distance variable .",
    "a typical example is ripley s @xmath1-function .",
    "the tests are based on the differences of empirical and theoretical values of @xmath2 , which are called `` residuals '' in the following .",
    "a problem is how to handle the residuals for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "one possibility is construction of envelopes around the theoretical summary function and to look if the empirical summary function is completely between the envelopes .",
    "this very popular method , which goes back to @xcite , has a difficult point : to guarantee a given significance level and to determine @xmath3-values , see the discussion in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach was proposed by @xcite , who introduced statistics which compress information from the residuals for intervals of @xmath0-values to a scalar .",
    "this approach has analogues in classical statistics , namely the kolmogorov - smirnov and von mises tests . in the present paper tests in diggle s spirit",
    "are called _ deviation tests_.    though diggle s procedure is accepted as a standard in spatial point process statistics , to our knowledge there are no studies which explore its properties systematically . several power comparisons for different forms of deviation tests have been reported ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these investigations concern only specific issues . in the present paper , we consider the construction of deviation tests in more detail and systematically and give general recommendations for their use , for stationary as well as for finite point processes",
    ".    recall that a classical deviation test in point process statistics is based on a summary function @xmath2 for the null model and its unbiased estimator @xmath4 .",
    "if there would be _ a priori _ a value of distance @xmath0 which is of main interest , then one could proceed as in classical tests by comparing the empirical value @xmath4 with @xmath2 for this @xmath0 , i.e.  to consider the residual @xmath5 .",
    "however , since usually such a single special distance @xmath0 is not given , one would like to consider the residuals simultaneously for all distances @xmath0 in some interval @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "thus , one is confronted with a situation typical for multiple hypothesis testing ( or multiple comparisons ) , see @xcite .",
    "a deviation test resolves the multiple hypothesis testing problem by summarizing the residuals for all @xmath0 in @xmath7 into a single number by some deviation measure , e.g.  the maximum absolute residual in @xmath7 .",
    "a summary function frequently used in point process statistics for stationary processes and in deviation tests is ripley s @xmath1-function @xcite .",
    "since @xcite found that , under csr , the @xmath8-function resulting from the transformation @xmath9 has a variance which is approximately constant over the distances @xmath0 , the @xmath8-function became popular .",
    "consequently , it is empirically well - accepted that a deviation test based on the @xmath8-function is `` better '' than a test based on the @xmath1-function .",
    "variance - stabilising transformations are available also in other cases , see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite , whereas many summary functions such as the nearest neighbour distribution function ( @xmath10- or @xmath11-function ) and @xmath12-function @xcite are employed without transformations .",
    "we show that it is useful to use transformations and additional scalings of the residuals , particularly relative to their variances , in order to uniform the contributions of residuals for different distances @xmath0 .    besides transformations and scaling also other elements of deviation tests have influence on its power .",
    "these are the basic choice of the summary function @xmath2 , the interval of distances @xmath7 and the deviation measure .",
    "we explore the role of these elements through a simulation study for an important test problem for marked point processes : checking the random labelling hypothesis , which says that the marks of a marked point pattern are independent .",
    "note that this particular case contains all elements of a deviation test in point process statistics , for the stationary as well as for the finite case .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : background ] explains the fundamentals of deviation tests in point process statistics , in a generalised form applicable also for non - stationary and finite processes and biased estimators .",
    "section [ sec : construction ] then discusses the construction of deviation tests in detail , from the point of view of multiple testing .",

    "processes are considered , but the main ideas hold true also for point processes in @xmath17 for @xmath18 .    if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are stationary , they have an intensity which is denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "the mark distribution function is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "its mean and variance are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    the statistical analysis is based on observations in a window @xmath25 , which is a compact convex subset of @xmath17 . in the planar case",
    "the window is often a rectangle .",
    "when distributional hypotheses for point processes have to be tested , deviation tests as suggested by @xcite are a popular tool .",
    "we consider these tests here in a generalised form .",
    "such a test is based on a test function @xmath26 that characterises in some way the spatial arrangement of the points and/or marks in the window @xmath25 .",
    "there are many possibilities for such functions . in the classical case ,",
    "a common choice for @xmath26 is an unbiased estimator @xmath4 of some summary function @xmath2 , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for examples .",
    "popular functions for stationary processes in the case without marks are ripley s @xmath1-function , the nearest neighbour distance distribution function ( @xmath11-function ) and the empty space function / spherical contact distribution ( @xmath27-function ) . for stationary marked point processes ,",
    "various mark correlation functions including the mark - weighted @xmath1-functions are available . for non - stationary or finite processes",
    "analogues of stationary - case characteristics can be used .",
    "since deviation tests are in essence monte carlo tests , one needs to be able to generate spatial point patterns for the tested null model in @xmath25 and to calculate @xmath26 for data and each simulated pattern .",
    "the function for data is denoted below by @xmath28 and for @xmath29 simulations the corresponding functions are @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",

    "the rank of @xmath37 among the @xmath33 is the basis of the monte carlo test @xcite .",
    "there are various ways to obtain @xmath32 .",
    "the classical case is that of a stationary point process , an unbiased estimator @xmath4 of a summary function @xmath2 and the known form of @xmath2 for the null model .",
    "then it is simply @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "usually edge - corrected estimators are then needed . also in some other cases , the expectation @xmath32 is analytically known , as for the example considered in section [ sec : simulation_study_setup ] .",
    "otherwise , @xmath32 has to be determined statistically based on simulations of the null model in the window @xmath25 .",

    "the statistics @xmath33 are exchangeable and , under the null hypothesis , all rankings of @xmath37 among the @xmath33 are equiprobable as in the case where @xmath46 is obtained analytically or from another set of simulations .",
    "this section discusses in detail how the global deviation test statistic @xmath47 is constructed from a test function @xmath26 of a pattern observed in a window @xmath25 and its expectation @xmath32 under the null hypothesis .",

    "examples are the supremum deviation measure @xmath51 and the integral deviation measure @xmath52 both measures are used in the present paper , both in a discretised form .      probably in many cases",
    "it makes sense to transform summary functions in the context of deviation tests .",
    "while for interpretation and description the traditional summary characteristics should be used , for tests modifications or transformations may behave better .",
    "use of a transformation function @xmath53 leads to residuals @xmath54 . besides the square root transformation used in the context of the @xmath8-function ,",
    "a further example is the transformation @xmath55{\\cdot}$ ] used by @xcite and @xcite , e.g. , for a third order analogue of ripley s @xmath1 function for planar processes . for @xmath27- and @xmath11-functions",

    "sometimes the variation of raw residuals differs clearly for the @xmath0-values in the interval @xmath7 , and therefore the residuals contribute differently to the global deviation measure @xmath50 .",
    "the contributions can by made more equal by making the distribution of residuals more uniform in @xmath7 .",
    "this can be carried out by weighting the raw residuals by weights @xmath63 which depend on the distribution of @xmath26 under the null hypothesis , and by working with scaled residuals @xmath64 .",
    "two natural choices are _ studentised _ scaling @xmath65 and _ quantile _ scaling @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the variance of @xmath26 under the null model , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the @xmath0-wise 2.5@xmath70-upper and -lower quantiles of the distribution of @xmath26 under @xmath71 .",
    "these weights are typically not available analytically but can be easily determined by simulation similarly as @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite applied the studentised scaling to the @xmath12-function , while the quantile scaling was used by @xcite in the context of the ( centred ) @xmath8-function .",

    "however , as the results in figure [ fig_simexp_rangeofdist ] show , if appropriate transformations and scalings are used , there is only a weak relationship between the power and the length of @xmath7 .",
    "however , for the seqnimpp model , the non - powerful deviation measure is still clearly more powerful on @xmath141 than on @xmath143 and @xmath142 ( figure not shown ) .",
    "$ ] , @xmath137 $ ] and @xmath136 $ ] for the models of table [ table : simexp_models ] with the most powerful mark test functions ( top panel ) using the supremum deviation measure applied to the raw residuals of @xmath145 and @xmath151 and scaled residuals of @xmath151 ( right panel ) . ]    at the end of this section we mention briefly the two further results .",
    "the first concerns the problem of edge - correction .",
    "as discussed already , the estimator stems from the stationary process context . in the random labelling test",
    "there is no need of edge - correction since we deal with a fixed point pattern in the bounded window @xmath25 .",
    "so we also made the tests on @xmath142 for the processes in table [ table : simexp_models ] without edge - correction ( i.e.  @xmath153 ) and observed that the power was a little higher than for the estimator with edge - correction if no scalings were used .",
    "we also made a corresponding simulation experiment as reported above based on @xmath154 points in a window of size @xmath155\\times[0,200]$ ] .",
    "the results with @xmath154 were analogous to those with @xmath132 , except the values of power were larger , showing the consistency property empirically .",
    "this paper considers the construction of deviation tests for point processes in a general form .",
    "the tests are applicable also for non - stationary and finite point processes , since they are based on a test function and its expectation under the null hypothesis , which can be estimated from simulations from the null model if it is not known analytically .",
    "thus , there is no need to assume stationarity and to use unbiased estimators of summary functions in the test .",
    "the paper demonstrates the tests for finite and stationary point processes in the case of the random labelling hypothesis .",
    "the main point in constructing a powerful deviation test is to choose a suitable test function @xmath26 . for the random labelling test we used mark - weighted @xmath1 functions , where the choice of the mark test function @xmath123 is essential .",
    "which mark test functions will lead to the most powerful test depends on properties of the point pattern under analysis .",
    "if a researcher has an alternative model in mind , this model may suggest the mark test function to be used .    when the test function @xmath26 is chosen , the next problem is search for a suitable transformation .",
    "the simulation study shows that transformations of summary functions can increase the power of deviation tests , since they allow to make the distribution of residuals more uniform over distances .",
    "there are some classical transformations , and perhaps new transformations can be developed .",
    "finally , scalings of residuals can further improve the power of tests based on transformed summary functions , because they lead to approximately even variances of residuals for different distances , unlike transformation only .",
    "while transformations may reduce or induce asymmetry in the distribution of residuals , scaling is a simple way to make distributions of residuals more uniform . as shown by the simulation study",
    ", scalings also act in some form of balance with the choice of the length of the interval @xmath7 , i.e.  an appropriate scaling can make the choice of @xmath7 unimportant .    in some sense",
    ", the role of transformations and scalings is similar to that of prior distributions in bayesian statistics .",
    "if there is not an a priori interesting distance @xmath0 , then it makes sense to give similar importance to all residuals in the chosen interval of distances @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the residual distributions for different distances should be made uniform , which , in the context of deviation tests , can be done by means of transformations and scalings .",
    "as the toy examples and the simulation study demonstrated , such transformations and scalings typically , but not necessarily , improve the power of the deviation test .",
