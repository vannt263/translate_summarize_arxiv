    "properties of the wave functions of pairs of nucleons in a mass @xmath7 projectile can be probed using sudden two - nucleon removal reactions , that exploit fast , surface - grazing collisions of the projectile with a light target nucleus .",
    "the sensitivity is to the wave functions of the nucleons at and near the surface of the projectile .",
    "when combined with @xmath8-decay spectroscopy , partial cross sections of populated final - states in the mass @xmath3 reaction residues can be determined .",
    "this direct reaction mechanism , its cross sections , and their distributions with the momenta of the forward travelling residues , are now being exploited as a spectroscopic tool in studies of the evolution of nucleon single - particle structure near the fermi surfaces of some of the most exotic nuclei ; see for example refs . @xcite and citations therein .",
    "the reaction observables used are , currently , inclusive with respect to the final states of both the removed nucleons and of the struck light target nucleus .",
    "more exclusive measurements , e.g. of the light charged fragments in the final - state , may in the future provide additional probes of the projectile structure @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the two - nucleon removal reaction mechanism , its eikonal reaction - dynamical description , and the cross sections and their momentum distributions , in the case of high - energy two - nucleon removal from @xmath0c , was presented in ref .",
    "a feature of this model description is that the removal cross sections involve only elastic interactions of the projectile residues with the target but sums of contributions from both elastic and inelastic interactions of one or both nucleons with the target @xcite .",
    "new data , for the @xmath9-shell nucleus @xmath10 mg and the @xmath10mg(@xmath112p ) reaction , have quantified these different contributions experimentally @xcite , and have confirmed that the relative importance of these different processes to the cross sections are consistent with the predictions of the eikonal dynamical model .",
    "this has provided an important additional test of the reaction model . in the earlier work for @xmath0c @xcite",
    ", the theoretical comparisons used the sums of these removal contributions and @xmath1-shell ( @xmath12 shell - model ) structure calculations were used to construct the required @xmath13 two - nucleon overlaps .",
    "the pjt @xcite and the wbp @xcite shell - model effective - interaction hamiltonians were used .",
    "key elements of that analysis are also relevant here : + ( i ) the reaction is geometrically selective @xcite and the two - nucleon removal cross sections will be enhanced if the projectile ground - state has components with pairs of nucleons with strong spatial correlations ( localization ) .",
    "+ ( ii ) the available experimental cross section data , from high - energy primary - beam measurements , are inclusive with respect to the populated bound states of the residues following @xmath4 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 removal @xcite .",
    "the data , at three energies , reveal a significant enhancement of the ratio of unlike - pair yields , @xmath16 , to those for the like - nucleon pairs , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this enhancement is significantly greater than that expected based simply on the numbers of available 2n - pair combinations ( i.e. a factor of 8/3 ) .",
    "for example , the experimental @xmath19 ratio was 8.54 for the data set with a @xmath0c beam of energy 2.1 gev per nucleon .",
    "some ( but not all ) of this enhancement could be explained as due to the pair - correlations already generated in @xmath12 @xmath1-shell - model overlap functions and because a larger fraction of the @xmath14-removal strength leads to unbound @xmath6c final states .",
    "however , the experimental @xmath16 remained factors of 1.45 to 2.2 larger than the theoretical model calculations for the three available data sets @xcite .",
    "table [ 12c ] , reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite , shows both the @xmath1-shell - model results and data .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in these cases there is interference between the different configurations that make it less transparent what one expects from the different interactions .",
    "changes in the @xmath1-shell configurations will account for a part of the changes in cross sections shown in table [ tbl : c12_2n ] and the predicted momentum distribution widths for the second @xmath20 state , offering a means to discern between the different interactions .",
    "further enhancement of the cross section may arise from the new couplings to higher major shells .",
    "coupling to major shells of the same parity ( odd @xmath21 ) will lead to generic changes to the overall size of the two - nucleon overlap functions and tna .",
    "the tna due to mixing with major shells of opposite parity ( even @xmath21 ) leads to new interference affects that can enhance two - nucleon spatial correlations ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the first @xmath20 this can be seen in fig . [",
    "fig : projden ] for calculations based on the ncsm1 hamiltonian .",
    "the left panel is calculated when retaining only the 0@xmath22 @xmath1-shell tna components from the @xmath23 ncsm calculation .",
    "the right panel includes the full set of ncsm tna for all major shells .",
    "the enhanced spatial correlations presented to the target nucleus from the inclusion of single - particle configurations with opposite parity in the two - nucleon overlap function are evident .",
    "the cross sections from these truncated and full tna sets are 6.09 and 8.52 mb , respectively .",
    "both exceed those of the @xmath1-shell shell - model calculations , this being 3.58 mb for the wbp interaction tna",
    ".    for both ncsm1 and ncsm2 the enhancement of the @xmath4 removal cross sections relative to the wbp calculations is larger than that for the like - nucleon , @xmath14 , removal cross section .",
    "however , the difference in this ratio is relatively small . despite the larger @xmath4 removal cross section",
    "obtained , some underestimation of the experimental @xmath4 channel cross sections still remains .",
    "the available data again suggests that there are remaining deficiencies in the @xmath24 parts of the two - nucleon overlap functions . the yields to specific final states , namely the first 3@xmath25 , 1@xmath25 and 0@xmath25 states , suggest a significant sensitivity to the interactions used , requiring input from final - state - exclusive measurements .",
    "we have considered the impact of microscopic , ncsm wave function overlaps on the theoretical cross sections for two - nucleon removal reactions from fast @xmath0c projectiles .",
    "data were available for reactions on a carbon target at beam energies of 250 , 1050 and 2100 mev per nucleon .",
    "as found in a previous analysis @xcite , the @xmath4 removal cross sections are underestimated by the theoretical model calculations , but do show an enhancement relative to the use of truncated - basis @xmath1-shell - model calculations .",
    "the cross sections to both @xmath24 and @xmath26 states are enhanced , and the use of large - basis ncsm amplitudes does not fully resolve the relative discrepancy between measured @xmath4- and @xmath14-removal cross sections .",
    "further measurements , of final - state - exclusive cross sections and residue momentum distributions , would allow a much more detailed scrutiny and confrontation of the detailed reaction observables predictions , including the identification of any indirect reaction components arising from two - step paths to the final - states .",
    "the calculated @xmath4-removal cross sections to the @xmath5=0 , @xmath6b final states were shown to have sensitivity to the different variants of the chiral interactions used ; for example , the ratio of the calculated cross sections to the @xmath6b ground @xmath27 and first @xmath28 excited states . to a lesser degree",
    "the first @xmath29 state cross section and the branching between the first @xmath30 and @xmath31 states was found to depend on the effective interaction . in this case , data for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 removal channels would provide useful verification .",
    "the momentum distribution of the second @xmath28 state also shows a particular sensitivity to the interaction , providing a further useful probe .",
    "the overall conclusion from the present analysis is that the existing residue - final - state - inclusive data suggest that the @xmath5=0 , @xmath4-spatial correlations present in the wave functions used are still insufficient .",
    "we have shown that new exclusive measurements would offer a means to interrogate these shell - model inputs , in particular for the @xmath4-channel , @xmath24 wave functions , and the direct reaction mechanism predictions in considerable detail .",
