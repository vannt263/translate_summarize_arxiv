    "meanwhile , the charge for the states near @xmath30 is highly localized on the layer subject to compressive strain , regardless of the direction of the applied electric field .",
    "the situation for the states in vicinity of @xmath31 is similar except that the charge prefer to highly localized on the layer under tensile strain . hence forming a layer selective contact to an isolated edge state",

    "if the edge boundaries have substantial width , forward scattering part of the coulomb interaction will be the dominant correlation effect to the edge states and lead to luttinger liquid behavior @xcite .",

    "this identification enables us to address effects of symmetry changes : topological quantum phase transitions .",
    "there are recent studies of such perturbations for specific cases such as rashba spin - orbit coupling  @xcite and magnetic ordering  @xcite . through our first application of spt classification scheme by @xcite to a concrete physical system of multi - layer graphene",

    "now it is straight forward to show that ba stacking is equivalent to ab stacking subject to the opposite gate polarity . at zero field",
    "the hamiltonian of the ab stacked bilayer can be transformed to that of the ba stacking by interchanging the two layers via the following unitary transformation : @xmath40 , with @xmath41 . for a gated bi - layer however , the gate polarity has to flip since @xmath42 hence at the level of low energy effective theory , the tilt boundary between ab and ba stacking under uniform external field is equivalent to the gate polarity domain wall of structurally uniform bi - layer proposed by @xcite .    the above equivalence combined with earlier results on valley chern number of gated chirally stacked multi - layer offers the topological origin of the helical edge states observed in the microscopic calculation of section  [ sec : micro ] .",
    "first for bi - layer and then for general @xmath4-layers , it was shown that low energy effective theory of chiral stacked @xmath4-layer under uniform vertical electric field @xmath19 has finite chern number per spin for each valley of equal magnitude and opposite sign  @xcite : @xmath43 the chern numbers in eq .",
    "can be obtained by integrating the berry curvature over momenta @xmath44 continuing the linearized dispersion to infinity .",
    "this combined with the equivalence relation of eq .",
    "means the valley chern numbers change sign at the tilt boundary .",
    "such sign change leads to @xmath45 across the tilt boundary and @xmath4 branches of valley helical edge states  @xcite , as long as the two valleys @xmath28 and @xmath29 remain distinct .",
    "hence the two valley helical edge states per spin observed in section [ sec : micro ] originate from the valley chern number change across the tilt boundary , as in the gate polarity boundary edge states  @xcite . hence , our prediction is the tilt boundaries will be the first experimentally observed crystalline topological defects to host topological gapless mode due to change in the chern number .",
    "we now apply the procedure for identifying the class of spt based on symmetries of free fermion hamiltonian developed by @xcite , which predicts possible number of protected edge ( surface ) states .",
    "this procedure allows us to consider additional symmetries in the multi - layer graphene in addition to the @xmath46 , @xmath1 , and @xmath47 taken into account in the pioneering work by @xcite , and by @xcite .",
    "the procedure consists of three steps : ( 1 ) find a gapless dirac hamiltonian ( by keeping the kinetic term only ) with the same symmetries .",
    "then we find all the symmetry preserving mass terms that can gap out the gapless part and are amenable to classification using clifford algebra .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the spt order is robust as long as the energy gap stays finite and the symmetries remain the same and hence any gapped hamiltonian can be adiabatically transformed into a gapped dirac hamiltonian .",
    "( 2 ) express the hamiltonian and the conserved quantities associated with symmetries in the majorana basis .",
    "this leads to the clifford algebra ( i.e. real representation of the dirac algebra ) associated with the gapless part of the hamiltonian .",
    "( 3 ) find the space of mass matrices that anti - commutes with all the generators of this clifford algebra .",
    "the resulting space may have disconnected pieces , the number of which gives the classification of the spt .",
    "two mass matrices are topologically distinct if and only if they belong to two different pieces . applying this procedure to chiral multi - layer graphene will enable us to study phase transitions into different spts upon symmetry changes .    for chiral multi - layer graphene system , we assume no valley mixing , electron number conservation @xmath48 , and time reversal ( @xmath1 ) symmetries .",
    "the relevant gapless dirac hamiltonian is : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , in which @xmath53 is given by the number of layers .",
    "this hamiltonian can be written in the majorana fermion basis using the following decomposition @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the majorana fermion satisfying @xmath56 where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) denotes the a , or b sublattice ( @xmath28 or @xmath29 valley ) indices , and @xmath59 denotes the flavor of the majorana fermions ( + or - ) . in the majorana fermion basis the hamiltonian is represented as follows :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is a real anti - symmetric matrix ( differential operator ) , and @xmath62 is an eight component vector whose components are @xmath63 .",
    "now we express the conserved quantities associated with the symmetries of the hamiltonian in the majorana fermion basis .",
    "first , no valley mixing combined with total electron number conservation symmetry leads to separate conservation of the electron number at each valley @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "hence the total electron number @xmath66 , and the valley polarization @xmath67 are conserved . in the majorana fermion basis ,",
    "@xmath68 where @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) pauli matrices act on the majorana flavors ( valley indices ) .",

    "on the other hand , no valley mixing implies the hamiltonian is invariant under @xmath77 transformation which acts like @xmath78 in the valley basis .",

    "using eq . , it can be verified that @xmath104  @xcite .",
    "consequently , each class of the time reversal invariant multilayer graphene in the absence of intervalley scattering is indexed by a @xmath32-valued number : in this case the valley chern number .",

    "can be considered alongside systems under external field , as once a system is deep inside the ordered phase it can be treated within mean - field theory .",
    "we first consider the symmetry reduction possibilities while maintaining spin degeneracy ( see table [ table : spinless ] ) .",
    "if we only break the time reversal symmetry , the system is characterized by two independent topological indices @xmath105 , hence the classification is given by @xmath106 .",
    "we refer to these spt phases as intra - valley quantum ( anomalous ) hall ( qah ) states .",
    "such phases may be realized by placing trigonally - strained graphene @xcite under an external magnetic field , as the sign of the pseudo - magnetic field caused by strain is opposite for the two valleys .",

    "electron number conservation turns the above insulators into superconductors . following the procedure above",

    "table [ table : spinless ] summarizes all symmetry reduction possibilities and their classifications starting form gated multi - layer graphene .",
    "now we consider extending our classification to take the electron spin into account as a dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "this will allow us to consider interaction effects at the level of spin ordering . with both spin and valley degrees of freedom ,",
    "there are three symmetry operators related to time reversal : @xmath107 exchanges two valleys , @xmath108 which acts on the spin indices flips spin , and @xmath109 does both .",
    "if both @xmath110 and @xmath111 are broken , the classification reduces to that of spinless electrons ( see upper part of table [ table : spinful ] ) .",
    "however , taking any of these symmetry operators into account leads to new classes ( see lower part of table [ table : spinful ] ) .",
    "when all @xmath112 , @xmath110 ( and as a result @xmath111 ) and no valley - mixing symmetries are imposed the state corresponds to the so - called `` layer antiferromagnetic '' ( laf ) phase predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite and possibly occurring as a ground state in bi - layer graphene at neutrality point  @xcite .",
    "in this phase the product of spin and valley of edge quasi - particles is locked to their momentum .",

    "in this phase , for each valley , the edge states associated with two spins are counter - propagating . as long as",
    "these two counter - propagating modes do not couple , there can be any number of them per each valley , leading to @xmath114 spin - valley hall conductivity  @xcite .",

    "hence , unlike usual 2d qsh states  @xcite , we obtain @xmath32 .",
    "this is because multiple type of time reversal operators can be defined  @xcite in the presence of no valley mixing symmetry .",
    "this and other spt possibilities are summarized in table [ table : spinful ] .    with the classification at hand , we return to what it implies for the fate of the gapless edge states at the tilt boundary of chirally stacked and gated n - layer graphene .",
    "in general , a topological phase transition between two phases within the same class requires the bulk gap to close and reopen ( as in inter - plateaux transitions in integer quantum hall effect ) .",
    "gapless edge states are guranteed at a physical boundary between such two phases . the edge states at the ab - ba tilt boundary we established in the section ii are examples of such edge states .",
    "hence the edge states will remain gapless as long as the time ( valley ) reversal and charge conservation symmetry are maintained .",
    "on the other hand , symmetry change can either yield a trivial phase which does not support an edge state or a different type of spt with different type of edge states .",
    "according to tables i and ii , ruining the no valley mixing symmetry is the only way to render the system trivial and gap the edge states .",
    "however this requires large momentum transfer which generally requires fine tuning unless the unit - cell becomes enlarged either for the entire system  @xcite or for the edge through arm - chair edge , or short - range disorder such as a vacancy breaks @xmath121-@xmath122 sub - lattice symmetry  @xcite .",
    "as both rarely occur , we anticipate gapless edge states at most tilt boundaries .",
    "in particular , the natural zigzag boundary formation for the tilt boundaries make such edge states more robust than the edge states in gate polarity boundaries  @xcite .    among symmetry change possibilities leading to another spt , transition from qvh with spin degeneracy to laf phase where spin is",
    "a dynamic degree of freedom is of particular interest as laf is suspected to be the ground state of bi - layer graphene near neutrality point  @xcite . upon this phase transition",
    "the nature of edge states change from spin degenerate valley helical states ( qvh ) to spin - valley hall edge states ( laf ) .",
    "in such transitions , the bulk gap has to close and reopen ; this is indeed seen in the experiment of  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we discuss the experimental implications of our findings . specifically we propose the transport through the network of tilt boundaries as a solution to the long standing mystery of sub - gap transport@xcite .",
    "further we propose feasible experiments to test the proposal .    in order to discuss the topological transport through the network of tilt boundaries observed in refs .",
    "@xcite we should first discuss the effect of the arbitrary angle between the burger s vector @xmath6 and the tangent vector @xmath5 .",
    "microscopic study of tilt boundaries at various angles between @xmath6 and @xmath5 will be presented in the future@xcite .",
    "however , it has been known that a single domain bernal stacked gapped bilayer ribbon should support gapless edge state for zig - zag edges , but not for arm - chair edges  @xcite .",
    "this is because the arm - chair edge enlarges the unit - cell along the direction parallel to the boundary and makes the projection of k and k@xmath123 valley identical .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the polarity boundary edge states only develop barely visible gap which is orders of magnitude less then the bulk gap even for a sharp boundary , and the gap decreases quickly when the polarity boundary becomes smooth .",
    "these arguments apply to our tilt boundary and the edge state will develop a small gap when @xmath13 .",
    "however , given the large width of the observed tilt boundaries we expect that all straight tilt boundaries will have nearly gapless edge states except those with small angles between @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "when the tilt boundary meanders and changes directions , likely there will be portions with small gap segmenting the gapless regions and the transport will occur through hopping between the gapless regions . the observed 2d network of such tilt boundaries would yield 2d variable range hopping temperature dependence @xmath124@xcite at low temperatures governed by the 2d connectivity and the small characteristic gaps of gapped regions .",
    "this explains the observed temperature @xmath1 dependence of resistance at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "we propose following experiments to test our proposal .",
    "( 1 ) four terminal transport measurements with two of the contacts , say contacts 1 and 3 , at two ends of a tilt boundary .",
    "this would yield highly anisotropic transport proving dominant transport along the tilt boundary i.e. , @xmath125 .",
    "( 2 ) scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of local density of states .",
    "this should measure a gapless spectrum at the tilt boundary but exhibit a gapped spectrum with the gap magnitude of the optical gap away from the tilt boundary .",
    "( 3 ) thermoelectric imaging .",
    "the mid - gap density of state at tilt boundaries would appear in scanning thermopower images .",
    "unpublished thermopower imaging data by @xcite indeed show a network with local density of state near fermi energy , that is reminiscent of the tilt boundary network .",
    "( 4 ) edge current imaging using scanning squid which can detect magnetic field generated by edge currents .",
    "we showed that spin - degenerate tilt boundaries of gated multi - layer graphene support topological gapless edge states protected by three symmetries : time ( valley ) reversal , no - valley - mixing , and electron number conservation .",
    "we demonstrated the existence of gapless edge states through a tight - binding model calculation and a first principal calculation , where the latter took strain effects into account .",
    "we then addressed the symmetry protection of the edge states and consequences of symmetry changes within the framework of spt  @xcite .",
    "the framework of spt allowed us to place the 2d topological phase supporting the edge states , namely qvh , among various topological insulator / superconductor phases alongside previously postulated qah , laf and qsh .",
    "while previous literature postulated qvh , qah , laf and qsh to be all supporting number of edge states growing with the number of layers @xmath4 ( i.e. @xmath0-type in the language of classification ) , we found that the symmetry of laf only protects odd number of edge modes for each valley .",
    "hence laf is a @xmath116-topological insulator much like quantum spin hall insulator@xcite .",
    "transition between these different spt s require closing and re - opening of the bulks gap as already been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we predict the naturally occurring tilt boundary  @xcite to be the first topological structural defect hosting topologically protected gapless mode of transport , most importantly , our findings on tilt boundaries combined with the recent observations @xcite solve the long standing mystery of sub - gap transport  @xcite .",
    "our explanation can be tested through proposed transport , scanning tunneling spectroscopy and thermopower imaging experiments , and scanning squid experiments .",
    "experimental confirmation of the tilt - boundary transport origin of the sub - gap transport will open doors to control the sub - gap transport and enable device application of gated multi - layer graphene systems .",
