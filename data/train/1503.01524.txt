    "the hyperloop is a proposed rapid transportation system ideally suited to linking two metropolitan areas separated by between 200 km and 1500 km , such as los angeles and san francisco  @xcite . employing an elevated steel tube with reduced pressure , the hyperloop is intended to reduce travel times between these two cities to around 30 minutes .",
    "while the majority of the projected route follows the relatively straight interstate 5 ( i5 ) through the california central valley , entering the la basin presents a more formidable challenge .",
    "indeed , the existing rail transportation corridor must detour through the tehachapi and cajon passes .",
    "the i5 passes through a series of steep valleys between santa clarita and tejon ranch , making several sharp turns .",
    "ideally , the hyperloop should follow a similar path , with bridges and tunnels smoothing the kinks enough to ensure passenger comfort even while travelling up to ten times faster than a car .    in practice ,",
    "passenger discomfort can be avoided by making sufficiently gentle turns .",
    "the minimum radius of curvature is given by @xmath0 at a projected maximum speed of 1,220 km/h ( 339 m/s ) and a maximum lateral acceleration of half a @xmath1 , @xmath2 km .",
    "needless to say , the center of curvature must also smoothly vary  it would nt do to rattle passengers back and forth every second .",
    "the hyperloop is proposed to traverse these hills and bends at a slower speed , but maximizing the minimum radius of curvature is still strongly favored .",
    "the problem is thus defined .",
    "bridges and tunnels are expensive .",
    "the region s geography is highly non - trivial .",
    "the route must employ gentle turns , ideally no less than 23.4 km radius of curvature .",
    "this problem has an absurdly high dimensionality , and is thus well suited to the application of genetic algorithms : the second - best algorithm to solve any problem .",
    "genetic algorithms are not necessarily a cure - all .",
    "as anyone who has reproduced can tell you , genetics is a complicated business .",
    "the following elements are necessary , but not necessarily sufficient , to create a genetic algorithm that does nt waste everyone s time  @xcite .",
    "genetic algorithms use a genetic code , or genome , to parametrize a particular proposed solution .",
    "it is necessary to pick a representation that is sufficiently dense that phenotype ( the physical nature of the proposal ) is actually related to genotype ( it s coded form ) .",
    "there is an art to it , and we found that a bezier curve  @xcite , parametrized by a set of order 10 control points , was ideal for this purpose .",
    "in essence , each genome contains a single gene .      a genetic algorithm that introduces too much mutation in each generation is equivalent to a random search , and thus hopelessly inefficient .",
    "conversely , too little or too limited mutation will result in premature stagnation with no exploration of the solution space .",
    "some algorithms can dynamically vary mutation parameters .",
    "similarly , an algorithm that begins with , say , 100 different genomes will quickly eliminate the weaker ones , narrowing an already limited gene pool . to avoid stagnation due to inbreeding",
    ", one can introduce a small number of new , randomly generated genomes at every generation .",
    "in addition to tweaking mutation parameters and ensuring a steady flow of new genetic material into the system , genetic algorithms must also perform crossover . sometimes known as `` the fun part '' , crossover occurs where two selected genomes mix their parameters to create the next generation .",
    "mutation is typically introduced at this stage .",
    "this is the hardest part .",
    "a well designed genetic algorithm will find an optimal solution to the stated problem .",
    "if the problem is poorly stated , through poor design of a fitness function , then the solution will be unsatisfying . in the hyperloop problem , there are several metrics to optimize , including cost , curvature , and maximum grade . constructing",
    "a multidimensional pareto front is preferable to an arbitrarily chosen weighted average . in more complicated problems , co - evolving fitness criteria is necessary to find a suitable global solution . in this instance",
    ", comparing the genome fitness with randomly generated sequences is a good way to normalize between generations .",
    "we implemented the hyperloop routing genetic algorithm in _ mathematica _ , included in appendix  a. for the purposes of routing , we chose to start at the i5-i405 interchange near granada hills ( gps:34.29,-118.47 ) and end at the tesla supercharger in tejon ranch ( gps:34.99,-118.95 ) .",
    "geodata was obtained from the usgs website  @xcite , corresponding to the n35w119 graticule with 1 arc - second resolution in arcgrid format .",
    "our fitness function assumed a constant cost per length of tunnel , and a cost for bridges or pylons that scaled with both height and length .",
    "mathematically expressed , cost in $ /m is @xmath3 for a typical pylon height of 6 m , this gives a cost per km of $ 4.2 m . for tunnels , the whitepaper s suggestion of $ 31m",
    "/ km is probably an order of magnitude too low as the hyperloop will require at least two vacuum tunnels and a service tunnel  @xcite . additionally , the route has to cross the san gabriel , san andreas , and garlock faults , increasing geological complexity .",
    "we used a cost of $ 310m / km .",
    "it is worth noting that placement of an optimal corridor is not highly sensitive to cost - function parameters .",
    "the constraint on radius of curvature and maximum grade ( 6% ) was applied by calculating both using finite differences and then applying a steep penalty cost if limits were exceeded .",
    "the population is initialized with a specified number ( we used 200 ) of genomes .",
    "genomes are generated by randomly generating control points within the space .",
    "a specialized function converts them to a physical path from which metrics can be calculated .",
    "one such initial condition is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] . this population is entirely suboptimal , with paths that do not remotely follow the landscape , involve sharp turns , and pylons or bridges that vastly exceed today s engineering capability . within a hundred generations of the algorithm , however , the evolved population will be much better suited to the problem landscape .",
    "we found two solution classes that were locally optimal .",
    "the first underlines the challenges of using genetic algorithms , wherein a simulation found a simple straight tunnel 300 m above sea level through the entire range .    the other",
    ", much more interesting solution set initially follows the i5 corridor north , before diverting to the east over castaic lake , cutting across the western extremity of antelope valley and finally returning to the surface of the central valley .",
    "this solution is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : relief ] and  [ fig : profile ] .",
    "it features a minimum curvature radius of 20 km , a mean pylon height of 22 m , a total tunnel length of 48 km , and a maximum subsurface depth of 738 m . a nearby variant shown in appendix",
    "a achieves a minimum curvature radius of 23.5 km for the use of 54 km of tunnels  enabling transit through the grapevine without slowing until the destination .",
    "we have applied a genetic algorithm to solve a high dimensionality optimization problem .",
    "we have found a route for the hyperloop through the grapevine that permits a transit speed of 1130 km/h ( 314 m/s ) , reducing transit time by 139 seconds compared to that proposed in the whitepaper .",
    "more importantly , we have demonstrated the viability of an evolutionary approach to high speed transport route finding in general .",
