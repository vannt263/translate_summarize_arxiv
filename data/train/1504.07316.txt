    "thus , it is not surprising that numerous studies have been conducted over the past decades for the multiscale characterizations of the abl wind fields .",
    "diverse methodologies with varying degrees of complexities , ranging from the traditional spectral methods @xcite to the new - generation multifractal approaches @xcite , have been utilized .    to this date , the majority of the studies dealing with the identification of anomalous scaling ( sometimes even multifractality ) in the abl wind field focused on the microscale range ( time - scale of tenths of a second to tens of minutes ) .",
    "in contrast , only a handful of studies @xcite delved into characterizing the mesoscale range ( approximately , sub - hourly to sub - daily time - scale ) .",
    "they analyzed observational datasets from field sites around the world ( e.g. , china , france , new zealand , italy , the netherlands , turkey , and the usa ) .",
    "even though a few of these studies did not use wind data with adequate temporal resolution or sample size , the evidences of anomalous scaling in the mesoscale range were beyond any doubt .",
    "most remarkably , muzy et al .",
    "@xcite and bale and muzy @xcite found the intermittent nature of mesoscale wind fluctuations to be similar to its microscale counterpart ( encompassing the inertial - range of turbulence ) .",
    "similar conclusions were also recently drawn by liu and hu @xcite .",
    "owing to the dearth of long - term , high - quality upper abl data , almost all the aforementioned mesoscale wind characterization studies focused on the near - surface ( around 1020 m from the ground ) region .",
    "the only exception being the study by telesca and lovallo @xcite .",
    "they analyzed multi - year sodar - based wind data from various heights ( 50 m to 213 m ) above ground level ( agl ) .",
    "they used the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and the fisher - shannon information plane approaches to detect any signature of multifractality in wind speed time - series .",
    "interestingly , they found the scaling exponents to be strongly dependent on height . however , no physical explanation was provided .",
    "it is , however , plausible to speculate that the buoyancy effects are at the root of this height - dependency trait .    in the literature ,",
    "it is well - known that the shear production of turbulence overpowers the buoyancy effects near the surface .",
    "however , buoyancy forcing becomes increasingly dominant as one moves away from the surface @xcite .",
    "however , it is not known whether the buoyancy forcing modulates the anomalous scaling behavior of wind speed in the mesoscale range .",
    "therefore , we decided to address this intriguing issue in the present study .",
    "we make use of long - term wind datasets from several field sites with diverse geographical and climatological conditions ( table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "these datasets are measured with the aid of different types of research - grade instruments ( e.g. , cup anemometers , sodars ) .",

    ", observational data from the cabauw ( the netherlands ) meteorological tower have been used in various abl studies @xcite .",
    "we use 170 months of wind speed data ( collected during the years 20012015 ) measured by propeller vanes at heights of 10 m , 20 m , 40 m , 80 m , 140 m , and 200 m. we would like to point out that even though the landscape at cabauw is quite flat and open ( grassland ) , the existence of wind breaks and scattered villages cause significant disturbances in the near - surface region @xcite .",
    "the impact of this non - equilibrium behavior on scaling characteristics will be noted later in this paper .",
    "recently , the west texas mesonet ( wtm ) has installed sodars ( manufacturer : scintec , model : mfas ) at san angelo , midland , and reese technology center ( rtc ) , lubbock ( the usa ) .",
    "the typical vertical range of these sodars is from 30 m to approximately 300 m agl .",
    "they have a vertical resolution of 10 m. from the past two years ( 20132014 ) , we selected 8 months of wind speed data for scaling analysis .",
    "all the aforementioned datasets contain variable amount of missing data .",
    "this data - loss problem is more severe for the sodars .",
    "since a sodar is an active ground based acoustic remote sensing instrument , it suffers from signal attenuation at higher altitudes @xcite . to account for the data - loss problem in an objective manner across the sites , we perform the following data pre - processing procedures .",
    "first , instead of analyzing an entire time - series ( with sporadic gaps ) from any site , we split it into several monthly time - series ( each containing about 4300 samples ) .",
    "we discard a specific month s data from further analysis if any of the vertical levels contain more than 20% of missing samples . by performing this simple data exclusion strategy",
    ", we ensure that for a given site , all the tower / sodar levels have more - or - less ( within 20% ) the same amount of samples . in the case of the wtm sodar data",
    ", we have added an additional constraint .",
    "we consider only the months during which all the three sodars collected wind data simultaneously .    prior to scaling analysis ,",
    "we normalize ( zero mean , unit variance ) each monthly time - series .",
    "various orders of structure functions ( defined below ) are computed based on each normalized monthly time - series and then averaged over the different months .",
