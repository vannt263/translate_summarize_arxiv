    "the counterintuitive demonstration that a system of ising - like spins interacting ferromagnetically on the pyrochlore lattice is frustrated ( in the case that the local ising axes are the @xmath4 directions ) , while the antiferromagnetic counterpart is unfrustrated  @xcite , underpins the ongoing interest in the three rare earth pyrochlores tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the latter two are model materials for the physics of dipolar spin ice - a microscopic model derived from the @xmath5-ising ferromagnet ( or near - neighbor spin ice ) by the incorporation of dipolar interactions  @xcite , and now developed into an effective theory of a coulomb gas of emergent magnetic monopoles  @xcite .",
    "the monopole charge is revealed by the construction of the so - called dumbbell model  @xcite where each magnetic moment is replaced by a dumbbell carrying a magnetic charge @xmath6 at each end .",
    "the magnitude of the charge can be derived from the size of the magnetic moment @xmath7 , and the separation of the tetrahedron centers .",
    "current activity is focussed on developing understanding of magnetic coulomb gases , and testing the applicability of these ideas in real materials  @xcite .",
    "tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 on the other hand is ostensibly an example of the unfrustrated antiferromagnetic case , but strongly confounds the expected scenario of simple and complete long - range magnetic order by remaining in a correlated but magnetically disordered state down to the lowest temperatures .",
    "experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite attempts to cast light on the mechanism for this exception are the main activities .",
    "in magnetic materials based on rare earth ions , the crystal electric field ( cef ) controls the single ion ground state , which determines the size and anisotropy of the magnetic moment ; the wavefunctions of the single ion ground and excited states determine transverse components important for quantum fluctuations  @xcite , spin tunneling  @xcite , modification of spin interactions or anisotropies by virtual fluctuations  @xcite , and the presence of potentially interesting higher multipole moments  @xcite ; the spectrum of excited cef levels determines the temperature dependence of all these quantities , and controls interactions with phonons for spin flipping mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "hence , in a spin ice such as dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 or ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 it is essential to understand the cef hamiltonian in order to quantify the contribution of the magnetic moment @xmath7 to the monopole charge , to understand mechanisms by which the monopoles can hop  @xcite , and to quantify possible quantum corrections to the classical model  @xcite . in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "understanding of the cef wavefunctions is essential for development of theories of virtual fluctuations  @xcite , magnetoelastic interactions  @xcite , or higher multipoles  @xcite , which are all viewed as possible means to suppress long range magnetic order .",
    "because the cef parameters of a rare earth - based magnet are so important , various determinations have been made before for all three compounds . in ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 it is known from magnetization measurements that the single ion ground states must be close to pure @xmath8 and @xmath9 doublets respectively  @xcite , and for ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 this was confirmed by inelastic neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "the strong anisotropy , and also the activation energy for thermal spin flips ( @xmath10 k for ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite , and in the range @xmath11 k for dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite ) points to a very large gap to the first excited crystal field state .",
    "however , the exact level scheme and wavefunctions of dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 are still not known . in the absence of neutron scattering results ,",
    "cef parameters for dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 have been obtained by point - charge scaling of the known cef parameters of ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite , or from a cef analysis with simultaneous point - charge scaling of the entire @xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 series  @xcite , procedures which provide , at best , a useful guide to the actual values .    in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2",
    "there is considerable activity associated with the determination of the cef parameters .",
    "several reports concluded that the ground state doublet was separated from the first excited state by only 15 k , and that these were dominated by @xmath12 and @xmath13 components respectively  @xcite .",
    "however , the double - peak shape of a magnetic excitation at 15.5 mev was not previously noticed , and its assignment in more recent studies has led to debate . because of the peak shape , the single level was first reinterpreted as two crystal field excitations  @xcite .",
    "the resulting cef parameters reversed the dominant contributions to the wavefunctions of the ground and first excited states .",
    "however , it was pointed out  @xcite that the new parameters were inconsistent with all other proposals and the entire feature was subsequently treated as a single crystal field level with a splitting .",
    "the reason for the splitting could not be established experimentally , though it has been proposed theoretically to be due to a type of coupled electron - phonon state  @xcite .    by measuring the spectra of all three compounds , taking advantage of our investigation of the phonon band structure of the rare earth titanates  @xcite , and by investigating the double peak feature in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 using a single crystal , we are able to clarify the assignments and propose a set of cef parameters which are consistent across the three compounds .",
    "this also constitutes the first direct determination of the energy levels and cef parameters for dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we identify the double peak in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 as the signature of a crystal field - phonon bound state ( sometimes known as a vibron bound state ) , somewhat similar to that in ceal@xmath1  @xcite or cecual@xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the samples and spectrometers used in this study have already been described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we repeat the details for completeness .",
    "inelastic neutron time - of - flight measurements on 10 g powder samples of ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 were performed on the merlin spectrometer at isis @xcite .",
    "the samples were packed in envelopes of aluminum foil which were curled up to form an annular cylinder with diameter and height of 40 mm .",
    "subsequently , the samples were sealed into aluminum cans containing helium exchange gas , and cooled by a closed - cycle refrigerator on the instrument .",
    "different settings with incoming neutron energies of @xmath15 ( only for @xmath16 tb ) , @xmath17 and @xmath18mev , and corresponding chopper frequencies of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21hz were chosen to record data at @xmath22 and @xmath23k for @xmath20@xmath7amp hrs ( @xmath24 hours at isis full power ) each .",
    "the instrumental background at merlin is very low , and no aluminum contribution was visible in the raw data , so we did not measure the empty sample can separately .",
    "the raw data were corrected for detector - efficiency using a vanadium reference sample .    a powder sample of dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( with natural dysprosium isotopic abundance )",
    "was investigated using the 4seasons spectrometer at j - parc  @xcite .",
    "the 5 g sample was packed in an aluminum foil envelope which was wrapped into a cylinder of 30 mm diameter and 50 mm height , and then sealed in an aluminum can with helium exchange gas .",
    "the thickness of the sample was carefully controlled so as not to exceed 0.5 mm , to maximize the inelastic signal despite the large absorption cross section of natural dysprosium .",
    "using tabulated values for the total scattering and absorption cross sections of the constituent elements of dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , we estimated an optimal thickness of 0.85 mm for @xmath25 mev , making the common assumption that the packed powder has a density approximately 0.6 of the crystallographic density . when rolled into a cylinder , the sample thickness traversed by the neutrons approximately doubles , and our envelope thickness of @xmath26 mm gave a total path in the sample close to the optimum value .",
    "magnetic scattering was not included , but can make only a small contribution given the weight of the very large coherent cross section of dysprosium in the calculation ( due to @xmath27dy ) .",
    "we note that the absorption cross section is very significantly reduced at the higher energies in which we were mostly interested , for example @xmath28 ( absorption cross sections are typically tabulated for @xmath29 mev neutrons ) . for energies like 55 or 150",
    "mev our sample was therefore below optimal thickness , resulting in high transmission but longer counting times .",
    "4seasons was operated in repetition rate multiplication mode  @xcite . using a fermi chopper frequency of 250 hz",
    ", the phases of the other choppers were configured so that for a single source pulse , spectra were recorded either for @xmath30 mev , or for @xmath31 mev simultaneously .",
    "measurements were taken at @xmath32 k in both settings , and at @xmath33 k in the @xmath34 mev setting , for 8 hours each . in the @xmath34 mev",
    "setting , the instrumental background was measured at both temperatures to subtract the significant contribution from scattering due to phonons of the aluminum sample can from the raw data .",
    "the raw data were corrected for detector - efficiency using a vanadium reference sample  @xcite .",
    "absorption corrections were found to be unnecessary due to the optimized transmission described above .",
    "the assignment of optical phonons and crystal field excitations between 8 and 20 mev in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 was further investigated using the thermal triple - axis neutron spectrometer eiger at the swiss neutron spallation source sinq .",
    "the single crystal sample was previously characterized by heat capacity , x - ray diffraction , and inelastic neutron scattering measurements .",
    "this characterization was described in ref .",
    "[ ] ( in which the sample is known as ep2 ) , where the sample was shown to have no heat capacity peak at @xmath35 k , and the composition was estimated to be tb@xmath36ti@xmath37o@xmath38 .",

    "<S> dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 are dipolar spin ices , now often described as hosts of emergent magnetic monopole excitations ; the low temperature state of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 has features of both spin liquids and spin glasses , and strong magnetoelastic coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the crystal field excitations of all three compounds and obtained a unified set of crystal field parameters . </S>",
    "<S> additional measurements of a single crystal of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 clarified the assignment of the crystal field levels in this material and also revealed a new example of a bound state between a crystal field level and an optical phonon mode . </S>"
