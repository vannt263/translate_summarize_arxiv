    "the most widespread epidemic of ebola virus disease in history is currently ongoing in west africa .",
    "ebola virus is the most complex and lethal pathogen for humans @xcite .",
    "the first outbreak was in @xmath0 in congo , close to ebola river , where the disease takes its name .",
    "the ebola virus causes an acute , often fatal haemorrhagic illness .",
    "the current outbreak in west africa is the largest and most complex ebola outbreak since the virus discovery .",
    "the increasing of this virulent virus is extremely rapid and has evolved into a health and humanitarian catastrophe of historic scope .",
    "the incubation period , that is , the time interval from infection with the virus to the onset of symptoms , is @xmath1 to @xmath2 days .",
    "humans are not infectious to another person until they develop symptoms",
    ". symptoms typically begin with sudden onset of fever , sore throat , muscle pain , and headaches .",
    "then , vomiting , diarrhoea and rash usually follow , along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys . at this time",
    "infectious individuals begin to bleed , both internally and externally ( bleeding from nose , mouth , eyes and anus ) . in final stage , these symptoms are followed by death @xcite .",
    "ebola spreads through human - to - human transmission via close and direct physical contact ( through broken skin or mucous membranes ) with infected bodily fluids .",
    "the most infectious fluids are blood , faeces and vomit secretions ; however , all body fluids have the capacity to transmit the virus .",
    "the virus is also transmitted indirectly via exposure to objects or environment contaminated with infected secretions .",
    "because of this , healthcare workers must practice strict infection prevention and control precautions .    in epidemiology ,",
    "mathematical models are a key tool that contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of a virus and the impact of vaccination programmes .",
    "more precisely , mathematics has an important role in the study of propagation of virus spreads by allowing policy - makers to predict the impact of particular vaccine programmes or to derive more efficient strategies based on mathematical insights @xcite . in recent years",
    ", optimal control theory has become a powerful mathematical tool to assess the intervention of public health authorities .",
    "indeed , the inclusion , in an epidemic model , of some practical control strategies , like vaccines , social distancing or quarantine , provides a rational basis for policies designed to control the spread of the virus . in this spirit",
    ", the aim of this work is to investigate effective strategies to control the spread of the ebola virus by setting appropriate optimal control problems subject to a seir epidemic model that divides the population into four groups : the susceptible , the exposed ( infected but not infectious ) , the infectious , and the recovered @xcite . for a comparison study between the sir and seir models we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the main practical strategy of optimal control adopted is a vaccine @xcite .",
    "for fractional ( non - integer order ) models see @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we present the mathematical model that describes the dynamics of the spread of ebola virus in west africa . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we study several control strategies for the propagation of the virus by using the proposed model . in these strategies , we use parameters estimated from recent statistical data based on the who report of the 2014 ebola outbreak @xcite . in sections  [ subsec:3.1 ] and [ subsec:3.2 ] we study the case of control through vaccination treatment by considering two different objective functions . in section  [ subsec:3.3 ]",
    "we consider educational campaigns as a control , coupled with the vaccination treatment .",
    "we end with section  [ subsec:3.5 ] of discussion of the numerical results and with section  [ sec:4 ] of conclusions and future work .",
    "in this section , we describe the transmission of ebola virus by a seir model , where the population is divided into four groups : the susceptible individuals at time @xmath3 , denoted by @xmath4 , enter the exposed class @xmath5 before they become infectious .",
    "the infectious class at time @xmath3 , denoted by @xmath6 , represents the individuals that are infected with the disease and are suffering the symptoms of ebola . finally , we have the recovered class , which at time @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the total population , assumed constant during the short period of time under study , is given by @xmath8 at any instant of time @xmath3 .",
    "the transmission of ebola virus is then described by the following set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) : @xmath9 \\dfrac{de(t)}{dt } = \\beta s(t)i(t ) - \\gamma e(t),\\\\[0.30 cm ] \\dfrac{di(t)}{dt } = \\gamma e(t ) - \\mu i(t),\\\\[0.30 cm ] \\dfrac{dr(t)}{dt } = \\mu i(t ) .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] transitions between different states are described by the following parameters :    * the transmission rate @xmath10 , * the infectious rate @xmath11 , * the recovered rate @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ seir_fig1 ] shows the relationship between the variables of model .",
    "its numerical resolution is studied by rachah and torres in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a simpler sir model describing ebola .",
    "the model we consider here is very simple and assumes that the population is constant in the period of time under study : the sum of the right - hand side of the equations of system is zero .",
    "the possibility to design more complex models for a non - constant population is possible : see the recent eight state - variables model of @xcite",
    ". however , for the analysis and simulation of the model to be possible , the authors of @xcite imposed conditions to maintain the population @xmath13 constant .",
    "as remarked at the end of @xcite , the design of strategies when the population is not constant seems to be a good topic of research .",
    "recently , epidemiological models have used optimal control techniques .",
    "most works focus on hiv , tuberculosis ( tb ) and dengue @xcite .",
    "control efforts are carried out to limit the spread of the disease and , in some cases , to prevent the emergence of drug resistance . in this section ,",
    "we formulate several optimal control problems subject to the seir model , in order to derive the optimal treatment strategies . for each strategy",
    ", we study a specific objective in order to minimize not only the number of infected individuals and the systemic costs of treatments , but also to include an educational campaign with the vaccination treatment .",
    "the integration of educational campaigns has a great importance in countries that do not have the capacity to defend themselves against the virus .",
    "we compare the result of each strategy with the simulation results previously studied by rachah and torres in @xcite , the so called strategy  1 , which is described in section  [ subsec:3.1 ] .",
    "strategies  2 and @xmath14 are an improvement of the strategy  1 of @xcite , and are given in sections  [ subsec:3.2 ] and [ subsec:3.3 ] , respectively . more precisely , strategy  3 consists in the study of an educational campaign ( about the virus ) coupled with a vaccination treatment . a comparison between the different strategies and the simulation results",
    "is given in section  [ subsec:3.5 ] .",
    "two approaches are common in optimal control : direct and indirect methods @xcite .",
    "the direct methods are based in the discretization of the optimal control problems , reducing them to nonlinear constrained optimization problems .",
    "indirect methods are based on the hamiltonian and the pontryagin maximum principle . in this work",
    "we have adopted the direct approach .",
    "we have computed the numerical solutions of the optimal control problems with the help of the solver @xcite .",
    "is based on a multiple shooting method , including automatic differentiation and based ultimately on the semidirect multiple shooting algorithm of bock and pitt @xcite .",
    "the solver comes as a self - contained public domain software environment , written in , for automatic control and dynamic optimization .",
