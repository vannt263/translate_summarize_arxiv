    "the b - lons and f - lons have the same local optima , since both local search algorithms , although using a different pivot - rule , are based on the bit - flip neighborhood .",
    "the networks , however , have a different number of edges , as can be appreciated in the @xmath199 and @xmath200 columns of table [ tab : statistics ] , which report the number of edges normalized by the square of the number of nodes . clearly , the number of edges is much larger for the f - lons .",
    "this number is always the square of the number of nodes , which indicates that the f - lons are complete graphs .",
    "it is worth noticing , however , that many of the edges have very low weights ( see figure [ fig : weigths ] ) . for the b - lon model ,",

    "the f - lons correspond to complete networks ; the calculation of the clustering coefficients revealed that @xmath202 , @xmath203 ( not shown in the table ) .",
    "therefore , the f - lon is densely connected for all values of @xmath57 .",

    ". the heterogeneity decreases with increasing values of @xmath57 .",
    "this reflects that with high values of @xmath57 , the transitions to other basins tend to become equally likely , an indication of a more random structure ( and thus a difficult search ) .",
    "it can also be seen that the weights for the f - lon model are less heterogenous ( more uniform ) than for the b - lon one .    * shortest path length * : another standard metric to characterize the structure of networks is the shortest path length ( number of link hobs ) between two nodes on the network . in order to compute this measure on the optima network of a given landscape",
    ", we considered the expected number of bit - flip mutations to pass from one basin to the other .",
    "this expected number can be computed by considering the inverse of the transition probabilities between basins .",
    "more formally , the distance between two nodes is defined by @xmath207 where @xmath53 .",
    "now , we can define the length of a path between two nodes as being the sum of these distances along the edges that connect the respective basins .",
    "columns @xmath208 and @xmath206 in table [ tab : statistics ] report this measure on the two network models . in both cases ,",
    "the shortest path increases with @xmath57 , however , for the b - lon the growth stagnates for larger @xmath57 values .",
    "the paths are considerably longer for the f - lon , with the exception of the lowest values of @xmath57 .",
    "some paths are more relevant from the point of view of a stochastic local search algorithm following a trajectory over the maxima network .",
    "therefore , columns @xmath209 and @xmath210 in table [ tab : statistics ] , report the shortest path length to the global optimum from all the other optima in the landscape .",
    "the trend is clear , the path lengths to the optimum increase steadily with increasing @xmath57 , and similarly , the first - improvement network shows longer paths .",
    "this suggest that a larger number of hops will be needed to find the global optimum when a first - improvement local search is used .",
    "we must consider , however , that the number of evaluations needed to explore a basin , would be @xmath9 times lower for first - improvement than for best - improvement .",
    "* outgoing weight distribution * : the standard topological characterization of ( unweighed ) networks is obtained by its degree distribution .",
    "the degree of a node is defined as its number of neighbours , and the degree distribution of a network is the distribution over the frequencies of different degrees over all nodes in the network . for weighted networks , a characterization of weights is obtained by the _ connectivity and weight distributions _",
    "@xmath211 and @xmath212 that any given edge has incoming or outgoing weight @xmath213 . in our study , for each node @xmath30 , the sum of outgoing edge weights is equal to @xmath214 as they represent transition probabilities .",
    "so , an important measure is the weight @xmath215 of self - connecting edges ( remaining in the same node ) .",
    "we have the relation : @xmath216 .",
    "figure [ fig : wij_distri ] , reports the outgoing weight distributions @xmath212 ( in log - scale on x - axis ) of both the f - lon and b - lon networks on a selected landscape with @xmath217 , and @xmath218 .",
    "one can see that the weights , i.e. the transition probabilities to neighboring basins are small .",
    "the distributions are far from uniform or poissonian , they are not close to power - laws either .",
    "we could nt find a simple fit to the curves such as stretched exponentials or exponentially truncated power laws .",
    "it can be seen that the distributions differ for the first and best lon models .",
    "there is a larger number of edges with low weights for the f - lons than for the b - lons .",
    "thus , even though the f - lons are more densely connected ( indeed they are complete graphs ) many of the edges have very low weights .",
    "figure [ fig : weigths ] ( left ) , shows the averages , over all the nodes in the network , of the weights @xmath215 ( i.e. the probabilities of remaining in the same basin after a bit - flip mutation ) for @xmath218 and all the @xmath57 values .",
    "notice that , for both network models , the weights @xmath215 are much higher when compared to those @xmath219 with @xmath220 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : weigths ] right ) .",
    "the @xmath215 are much lower for the first than for the best lon . in particular ,",
    "in the b - lon , for @xmath2 , @xmath221 of the random bit - flip mutations will produce a solution within the same basin of attraction , whereas this figure is of less than @xmath222 in the f - lon .",
    "indeed , in this case , for @xmath57 greater than 4 , the probabilities of remaining in the same basin fall below @xmath223 , which suggests that escaping from local optima would be easier for a first - improvement local searcher .     for outgoing edges with @xmath224 ( in logscale on x - axis ) for @xmath225 .",

    "we have extended the recently proposed _ local optima network ( lon ) _ model to analyze the structural differences between first and best improvement local search , in terms of the local optima network connectivity and the nature of the corresponding basins of attraction .",
    "the results of the analysis , on a set of @xmath0 landscapes can be summarized as follows .",
    "the impact of landscape ruggedness ( @xmath57 value ) on the network features is similar for both models .",
    "first - improvement induces a densely connected network ( indeed a complete network ) , while this is not the case on the best - improvement model .",
    "however , many of the edges in the f - lon networks have very low weights . in particular , the self - connections ( i.e. the probabilities of remaining in the same basin after a bit - flip mutation ) , are much smaller in the f - lon than in the b - lon model , which suggests that escaping from local optima would be easier for a first - improvement local searcher .",
    "the path lengths between local optima , and between any optima and the global optimum , are generally larger in f - lon than in b - lon networks .",
    "we must consider , however , that the number of evaluations needed to explore a basin , would be @xmath9 times lower for first - improvement than for best - improvement .",
    "we , therefore , suggest that first - improvement is a better heuristic for exploring @xmath0 landscapes .",
    "our preliminary empirical results support this insight , a detailed account of them will be presented elsewhere due to space restrictions .",
    "most of our work on the local optima model has been based on binary spaces and @xmath0 landscapes .",
    "however , we have recently started the exploration of permutation search spaces , specifically the quadratic assignment problem ( qap ) @xcite , which opens up the possibility of analyzing other permutation based problems such as the traveling salesman and the permutation flow shop problems .",
    "our current definition of transition probabilities , although very informative , produces highly connected networks , which are not easy to study .",
    "therefore , we are currently considering alternative definitions and threshold values for the connectivity . finally , although the local optima network model is still under development , we argue that it offers an alternative view of combinatorial fitness landscapes , which can potentially contribute to both our understanding of problem difficulty , and the design of effective heuristic search algorithms .",
