    "in this paper we analyze the dynamics of a non - relativistic charged quantum system under the influence of an external classical random scalar field .",
    "we focus on the spectrum of the radiation emitted by the system , due to the interaction with the field .",
    "the study of the radiation emission is particularly important in the context of collapse models , because up to now this process sets the strongest bound on the possible values of the phenomenological parameters defining these models can take  @xcite .",
    "the idea is the following : collapse models modify the standard quantum evolution given by the schrdinger equation , by adding a nonlinear interaction with a random scalar field , which induces the collapse of the wave function  @xcite . in the case of a charged particle , the random field forces the particle to emit radiation , whereas standard quantum theory predicts no emission ( if the particle is free ) .",
    "therefore this situation represents a case - study for testing collapse models against the standard theory  @xcite .",
    "this calculation finds application also in the theory of open quantum systems",
    ". a charged particle in a bath , typically interacting with the other particles via a position dependent force , would also emit radiation .",
    "the problem of radiation emission was already studied in the literature of collapse models . in",
    "@xcite a calculation for the free particle was carried out to the first perturbative order using the continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) model  @xcite .",
    "this result was confirmed and generalized to the case of a non white noise in  @xcite , where the analysis was also extended to the case of an hydrogenic atom . later in  @xcite the formula for the emission rate",
    "was computed by using the simpler quantum mechanics with universal position localizations ( qmupl ) model  @xcite for the case of a free particle and a harmonic oscillator .",
    "however , the formula found in  @xcite did not agree with the one found in  @xcite as they should have : in the case of a white noise , the emission rate from a free particle found in  @xcite turned out to be twice that of  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy was clarified in  @xcite , where the perturbative calculation in the csl model was repeated .",
    "the result , in the white noise case , was found to be in agreement with the one of  @xcite .",
    "however it was also shown that , when the computation is generalized to the non white noise case , an unphysical contribution appears .",
    "in fact the formula for the rate was found to be  @xcite : @xmath0.\\label{eq : rate non white}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 have the usual meaning , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two parameters characterizing the csl model  @xcite , @xmath6 the mass of a nucleon , @xmath7 with @xmath8 the photon wave vector , and @xmath9 is the noise spectral density where @xmath10 is the noise time correlation function . in the white noise case @xmath11 , which implies @xmath12 for any @xmath13 . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate non white ] ) tells that the probability of emitting a photon with wave vector @xmath14 is proportional to the spectral density of the noise at the frequency @xmath15 .",
    "this is an expected contribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the first term is proportional to the spectral density of the noise at zero energy and is physically suspicious .",
    "in fact , the zero energy component of the noise is not expected to contribute to the emission of photons with an arbitrarily high energy .",
    "more precisely , as we will show , this energy non conserving term is exactly what in standard perturbation theory are known as  non - resonant terms \"  @xcite . in general",
    ", these terms should not give any important contribution when computing the emission rate .",
    "this is not the case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate non white ] ) .",
    "this shows that there are problems when standard perturbative techniques are used to find the emission rate",
    ". a first way out of the problem was found in  @xcite : it was shown that when the computation is repeated by taking wave packets as final states and by confining the noise , then the unphysical contribution proportional to @xmath16 is not present anymore .",
    "however , even if this prescription leads to a satisfactory result , it does not really clarify the origin of the unphysical terms .",
    "a deeper insight to the problem was obtained using the qmupl model , where an exact treatment of the problem is possible  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , in the case of a free particle , the unphysical term proportional to @xmath16 is still present .",
    "however , for an harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath17 , the unphysical term is suppressed by an exponential damping factor @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is important to note that treating the electromagnetic interaction at the lowest order is equivalent to setting @xmath21 , meaning @xmath22 , in which case the unphysical term @xmath16 is not suppressed anymore .",
    "the same problem arises when @xmath23 , which is the free particle case .",
    "therefore , the analysis done in  @xcite proved that in order to get a physically meaningful result , first the particle can not be treated as completely free and , second , the electromagnetic interaction can not be treated at the lowest perturbative order . using the above result ,",
    "the emission rate for an harmonic oscillator within the csl model was computed in  @xcite .",
    "the interaction with the noise was treated perturbatively and the one with the electromagnetic field exactly .",
    "it was found that , in the free particle limit , the emission rate is equal to the one given in eq .   without the unphysical term .",
    "however , this analysis lacks of generality : the calculations required to solve the heisenberg equations , while treating exactly the electromagnetic interaction , and this can be done only for simple systems .",
    "aim of this work is to derive a very general result , which can be applied to a large variety of systems and interactions . instead of considering a specific model , as done in the works previously cited , we derive a general result for a generic interaction with an external classic noise of the type described in eq .  .",
    "moreover , our result will holds for any generic bounded system , contrary to the previous analysis where only the free particle , harmonic oscillator and hydrogenic atom cases were considered .",
    "since we are considering generic systems , the calculation of the emission rate is too complicated to be done exactly , so we need to resort to perturbation theory .",
    "according to the results found in  @xcite , in order to avoid the presence of unphysical contributions , we have to find a way of including the effect of the higher order electromagnetic contributions to the interaction .",
    "a first order analysis would once again lead to the problem one encounters with eq .  .",
    "a first attempt might be to consider all the diagrams at the next relevant order . however , this would require too long a calculation , since the number of such diagrams is very large ( of order of seventy ) .",
    "as we will show , there is a more clever way to take into account the effects of the relevant higher order contributions .",
    "the key point is the observation that , as mentioned before , the unphysical term is exactly what in standard perturbation theory is known as",
    " non resonant \" term  @xcite .",
    "the most general and elegant way for avoiding the presence of these terms is to take into account the decay of the propagator .",
    "in fact , because of the electromagnetic interaction , the propagator is not stable and can decay  @xcite . we will show that , when this effect is taken into account , the unphysical term is not present anymore . as a result",
    ", we will be able to find a formula for the emission rate from a generic system .",
    "the result applies to all known collapse models and , as we mentioned before , also to open quantum system , where the effect of the environment is modeled by the interaction with a random potential .",
    "moreover , as mentioned before , this result is also valid for any quantum system interacting with an external classic noise field .",

    ", the electromagnetic field will be described by using the second quantization formalism .",

    "we are not making any assumption on the form of the potentials @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so they are generic and @xmath44 . as we will see , in the derivation of the emission rate ( eq .  ) a fundamental role",

    "when the initial state is not the ground state , the effect of the spontaneous emission due only to the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field is expected to be bigger than the one given in eq .  , which is due to the presence of the noise .",
