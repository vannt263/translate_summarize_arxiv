    "<S> the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 hyperon production in nn collisions is studied at the installation in order to investigate the production mechanism as well as to extract information about the y - n interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> cosy-11 is an internal magnetic spectrometer experiment at the cooler synchroton and storage ring cosy in jlich . </S>",
    "<S> it is equipped with scintillator hodoscopes and drift chambers for charged particle detection  @xcite and a scintillator / lead sandwich detector for neutrons  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 and @xmath0 hyperon production near the kinematical threshold was studied by the cosy-11 collaboration in @xmath4 reactions . </S>",
    "<S> data points , 16 for the @xmath0 and 13 for the @xmath3 channel , were taken in the excess energy range between 0.68 mev and 59.3 mev for the @xmath0 hyperon and between 2.8 mev and 59.1 mev for @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section ratio @xmath5 below excess energies of 15  mev was measured to be around 28 in contrast to the value of about 2.5 determined for excess energies higher than @xmath6 mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio for higher energies is in good agreement with the @xmath7 isospin relation , which is 3 ( see  figure  [ all_models ] ) .    to explain this unexpected threshold behaviour , </S>",
    "<S> various theoretical scenarios within meson exchange models were proposed . </S>",
    "<S> calculations have been performed with pion and kaon exchange added coherently @xcite or incoherently  @xcite , including the excitation of nucleon resonances  @xcite and heavy meson exchange ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 )  @xcite . although the various descriptions differ even in the dominant basic reaction mechanism , all more or less reproduce the trend of an increase in the cross section ratio in the threshold region . </S>",
    "<S> the present data are not sufficient to definitely exclude possible explanations . </S>",
    "<S> further studies e.g. for the other isospin projections will help to understand the threshold hyperon production . to be more specific lets consider the jlich meson exchange model@xcite where calculations are available for other @xmath11 channels . within this model </S>",
    "<S> the large cross section ratio @xmath12 at threshold is reproduced by a destructive interference of @xmath13 and @xmath14 exchange amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> calculations of the @xmath15 production in this model predict a factor of three higher cross section compared to the @xmath3 channel for a destructive and a factor of three lower for a constructive interference , a clear experimentally accessible signal . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio between @xmath15 and @xmath3 production will also differ strongly if the dominant production mechanism runs via an intermediate @xmath16 excitation or not . </S>",
    "<S> +    recently the @xmath15 production was measured at the cosy-11 installation via @xmath17 at q = 13 mev and q = 60 mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 is identified via the missing mass technique , by detecting the remaining reaction products - @xmath18 and neutron . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental resolution of the missing mass determination depends on the reconstruction accuracy of the four - momentum vectors for the registered neutrons and kaons . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum vector of the @xmath18 meson can be established by tracking the @xmath18 trajectory reconstructed from signals registered in the drift chambers ( d1 and d2 in the figure  [ cosy ] ) through the magnetic field back to the target point . </S>",
    "<S> assuming a hit in the neutron detector being due to a neutron , the four - momentum vector of the neutron is given by the measured velocity , the direction ( given by the first hit module ) of the neutron which can be reconstructed with an accuracy of at least the size of the module ( 9x9 @xmath19 ) and the known mass . </S>",
    "<S> the background from charged particles hitting the neutron detector is discriminated by veto scintillators ( veto in figure  [ cosy ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> + from the monte carlo studies the identification of the @xmath15 events is expected to be comparable to the @xmath3 or @xmath0 channels@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data are presently under analysis . </S>"
