    "in this paper we give a sequel to our previous works @xcite , where an exact brst invariant local formulation for the gribov - zwanziger ( gz ) framework @xcite was derived in the class of the linear covariant gauges . in its original original version @xcite , the gribov - zwanziger setup was outlined in the landau gauge , @xmath4 , in order to take into account the non - perturbative phenomenon of the existence of gribov copies , which affects the faddeev - popov quantization prescription .    according to @xcite , the main idea to face",
    "the issue of the gribov copies was to restrict the functional integral to a certain region @xmath5 in field space , called the gribov region , which is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hermitian faddeev - popov operator @xmath8 later on , important properties of the region @xmath5 were rigorously established @xcite , namely :    * @xmath5 is convex , a property which follows from the linearity of the faddeev - popov operator @xmath9 .",
    "* @xmath5 is bounded in all directions in field space .",
    "the boundary @xmath10 , where the first vanishing eigenvalue of the faddeev - popov operator shows up , is called the first gribov horizon . *",
    "every gauge orbit crosses at least once the region @xmath5 .    in particular , property _",
    "iii ) _ gives a well defined support to the restriction to the region @xmath5 .",
    "remarkably , a local and renormalizable action itself is not completely free from gribov copies @xcite , i.e.  additional copies still exist inside @xmath5 . a smaller region within @xmath5 exists which is fully free from gribov copies .",
    "this region is called the fundamental modular region .",
    "though , unlike the case of the gribov region @xmath5 , a local and renormalizable framework implementing the restriction to the fundamental modular region is , at present , unknown",
    ". therefore , we shall proceed by focusing on the region @xmath5 .",
    "] can be constructed for the restriction to @xmath5 : the so - called gribov - zwanziger action , see @xcite for a general review .    in @xcite",
    ", we have been able to move away from the landau gauge , generalizing the gribov - zwanziger construction to the class of the linear covariant gauges , i.e.  @xmath11 , where @xmath3 is the ( non - negative ) gauge parameter .",
    "obviously , the landau gauge can be seen as a particular case of the linear covariant gauges , corresponding to @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , as already mentioned , we were able , for the first time , to write down an exact nilpotent brst symmetry of the gribov - zwanziger action in the linear covariant gauges which has enabled us to derive a set of important properties , namely : the independence from @xmath3 of the brst invariant correlation functions and an exact all order prediction for the longitudinal part of the gluon propagator which agrees with the available lattice numerical simulations as well as with the results based on the analysis of the dyson - schwinger equations , see eq .   and related comments at the end of section [ specify ] .",
    "recent progress on the extension of the gribov - zwanziger set up to the linear covariant gauges was also done in @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in @xcite , a non - perturbative brst symmetry was constructed for the gribov - zwanziger action in the maximal abelian gauge and in @xcite , a non - perturbative brst quantization was proposed for curci - ferrari gauges .    the main tool employed in the analysis @xcite has been the introduction of a transverse and order by order gauge invariant field @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for the generator of an infinitesimal gauge transformation . as a consequence ,",
    "the correlation function @xmath16 is transverse and turns out to be left invariant by the brst transformations . as such , it is independent of the gauge parameter @xmath3 entering the gauge condition . for the benefit of the reader , some details of the construction of the transverse gauge",
    "invariant field @xmath13 have been surveyed in section [ survey ] .",
    "the aim of the present work is that of establishing useful relationships between the correlation function and the transverse component of the gluon propagator , i.e.   @xmath17 in particular , we shall be able to show that :    * the poles of the transverse component of the gluon propagator are independent of the gauge parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this nice property follows from the nielsen identities for the two - point gluon correlation function which can be derived from the slavnov - taylor identities corresponding to the exact nilpotent brst symmetry of the gribov - zwanziger action in the linear covariant gauges @xcite .",
    "we point out that , in the present case , the study of the nielsen identities requires a lengthy analysis , due to the existence of a nontrivial set of mixed propagators , a structure typical of the local gribov - zwanziger formulation .",
    "sections [ specify ] , [ nielsen ] and appendices [ pac ] , [ apdd ] contain the detailed analysis of the structure of the nielsen identities .",
    "we will also briefly discuss the relation between the nielsen identities and landau - khalatnikov - fradkin transformations . *",
    "a second property which we shall be able to prove is that the brst invariant correlation function coincides with the gluon propagator evaluated in the landau gauge , namely @xmath18 a relation which gives a quite practical way to evaluate @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , taking into account that the poles of the transverse part of the gluon propagator , eq .",
    ", are independent of @xmath3 , it follows immediately that the poles of @xmath2 and those of @xmath19 are the same , and this for a generic value of @xmath3 .",
    "* these two properties enable us to consider the brst invariant correlation function @xmath2 as the natural candidate to discuss the positivity violation of the gluon propagator in a brst and @xmath3-independent way , via the evaluation of the corresponding temporal schwinger correlator , a topic which will be addressed in section [ gauge ] .",
    "this is a rather relevant issue , as the positivity violation is nowadays taken as a strong indication of gluon confinement , see for instance @xcite and references therein . in this sense",
    ", it is certainly worth to have at our disposal a brst invariant framework to look at it .",
    "we end the paper with an application to the study of the masses of the transverse component of the gluon propagator when higgs fields in the fundamental representation of @xmath20 are added to the gribov - zwanziger action .",
    "the gauge invariant configuration @xmath21 , see appendix [ apb ] and @xcite , is constructed by minimizing the functional @xmath22 $ ] along the gauge orbit of @xmath23 @xcite , namely @xmath24 & \\equiv & \\min_{\\{u\\}}\\mathrm{tr}\\int d^{4}x\\,a_{\\mu } ^{u}a_{\\mu } ^{u}\\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the operator @xmath34 in expression denotes the inverse of the covariant laplacian @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the covariant derivative @xcite .",
    "let us proceed by specifying the non - perturbative local brst invariant action which will be taken as our starting point .",
    "in order to take into account the non - perturbative effects of the existence of the gribov copies , we shall make use of the brst invariant gribov - zwanziger action in linear covariant gauges as recently worked out in @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 while @xmath39 denotes the faddeev - popov gauge - fixing in linear covariant gauges , i.e. @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a non - negative gauge parameter , @xmath42 the lagrange multiplier and @xmath43 the faddeev - popov ghosts .",

    ", is hermitian due to the transverse character of @xmath0",
    ".    following @xcite , the field @xmath50 can be localised by means of the introduction of an auxiliary stueckelberg field @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 with @xmath53 the local invariance under a gauge transform @xmath54 of the field @xmath13 can now also be appreciated from the transformation prescriptions @xmath55 the fields @xmath56 are a pair of bosonic fields , while @xmath57 are anti - commuting fields .",
    "these fields are employed to cast in local form zwanziger s horizon term needed to get rid of the zero modes affecting the faddeev - popov operator .",
    "the mathematical justification of our construction can be found in @xcite .    finally , the term @xmath58 implements , through the lagrange multiplier @xmath59 , the transversality of the field @xmath0 , @xmath60 , which can be seen as a constraint on the stueckelberg field . indeed ,",
    "if the stueckelberg field @xmath51 is eliminated through the transversality constraint @xmath61 , we get back the non - local expression for the field @xmath13 , eq .  .",
    "this constraint also plays a crucial role to maintain the ultraviolet renormalizability of the theory @xcite .",
    "if we simply set @xmath62 , we would end up with similar power counting non - renormalizability issues as those plaguing the original stueckelberg model @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the action @xmath63 enjoys an exact nilpotent brst invariance , namely @xmath64 with the following full set of local transformations defined as @xmath65 the brst invariance of the action @xmath63 follows immediately by noticing that the field @xmath66 , eq .",
    ", is left invariant under the brst transformations , i.e. @xmath67 also , the brst transformation of the stueckelberg field @xmath51 can be constructed iteratively from @xmath68 , obtaining @xmath69      the brst invariance of the action @xmath63 can be translated at the functional level into powerful slavnov - taylor identities . to that purpose",
    "we employ the trick of extending the brst transformations on the gauge parameter @xmath3 , see @xcite , i.e. @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a parameter with ghost number 1 , which will be set to zero to restore the initial theory . as explained in @xcite , the extended brst transformations , eqs .  , , will permit us to keep control of the dependence of the green functions from the gauge parameter @xmath3 at the quantum level .",
    "taking into account the extended brst transformation , the gauge fixing term becomes now @xmath72 so that the action reads @xmath73 we are now ready to establish the ward identities of the theory .",
    "following the general procedure of the algebraic renormalization @xcite , we introduce a set of brst - invariant external sources @xmath74 coupled , respectively , to the non - linear brst variations of the elementary fields @xmath75 as well to the composite operator @xmath48 .",
    "namely , we start with the complete classical action @xmath76 where @xmath77 the complete action @xmath78 turns out to obey the following slavnov - taylor identity , @xmath79 where @xmath80 it was already shown in @xcite that , when the gribov horizon is removed , corresponding to set @xmath81 , the action @xmath78 , eq .  , is renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory . relying on the discussion of @xcite , which was essentially based on the observation that the gribov - type gluon propagator following from the action @xmath63 , see eqs .  , , displays a scalar form factor that can be decomposed as @xmath82 and generalizations thereof , one does expect that , once renormalizability has been proven for @xmath81 , it will be preserved when @xmath83 , given the strongly suppressed uv fall - off of the second term in eq .  , which encodes in fact the dependence from the parameter @xmath84 .",
    "a formal proof to all orders based on the ward identities is under construction @xcite and will be presented in a separate detailed work . keeping this in mind , the slavnov - taylor identities hold at the quantum level , namely @xmath85 with @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes the generator of the @xmath88 green functions of the model .",
    "the identities have far - reaching consequences , already exploited in part in @xcite , where an all order algebraic proof of the independence from the gauge parameter @xmath3 of the correlation functions of brst invariant operators has been given , together with an exact prediction for the longitudinal part of the gluon propagator .",
    "let us give a closer look at the two - point correlation functions of the model .",
    "to that end we introduce the generator @xmath89 of the connected green s functions through the legendre transformation @xmath90 @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a short - hand notation for all fields and @xmath93 for the external sources introduced for each field @xmath94 .",

    "@xmath97 i.e. @xmath98 where we have defined @xmath99 .    when written in terms of the connected generating functional , the slavnov - taylor identity takes the form @xmath100 acting , for example , with the test operators @xmath101 and setting all sources to zero , we immediately get that the propagators @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 are independent of the gauge parameter @xmath3 , namely @xmath105 a result which follows by observing that the fields @xmath106 are left invariant by the brst transformations and , moreover , they interact only with the brst invariant field @xmath107 . likewise , acting with the test operators @xmath108 we get @xmath109 finally , we remind that , according to @xcite , for the gluon propagator we have @xmath110 showing that the introduction of the gribov horizon does not modify the longitudinal component which remains equal to its standard perturbative expression . this result is supported by independent studies of the linear covariant gauge beyond perturbation theory , see @xcite for a lattice verification .",
    "dyson - schwinger equation s studies of the linear covariant gauges @xcite automatically incorporate the aforementioned behaviour of the longitudinal component as given by the standard slavnov - taylor identity is part of the premisses in this formalism . yet another approach to deal with the linear covariant gauge can be found in @xcite .    in the present case ,",
    "the tree level expression for @xmath111 is given by the gribov type propagator @xmath112",
    "we are now ready to derive the nielsen identity for the gluon propagator @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "the nielsen identities are a way to control the gauge parameter dependence of certain correlation functions and are ultimately a consequence of the brst invariance @xcite .",
    "though , in the present case the task is not straightforward , due to the existence of mixed propagators .",

    "taking then the fourier transform , making use of the ghost number conservation , lorentz covariance , color invariance , and multiplying everything by the transverse projector @xmath123 , one gets @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the transverse part of the @xmath88 two - point gluon correlation function , i.e. @xmath126 and where @xmath127 stands for the fourier transform of the transverse component of the insertion @xmath128 setting now @xmath129 eq .   becomes @xmath130 expressing the nielsen identity obeyed by @xmath131 .",

    "unfortunately , due to the presence of the term @xmath141 , it is yet unclear how eq .",
    "would imply that the poles of @xmath142 are @xmath3-independent .",
    "we remind in fact that , in the present case , @xmath143 , due to the existence of mixed propagators . a more complicated nielsen identity involving the determinant of the @xmath88 two - point function",
    "is needed to achieve the desired result , a topic which will be worked out in great detail in the next subsection . before delving into those details ,",
    "let us first spend a few words on the quantity @xmath144 appearing in eqs .   and .",
    "in particular , looking at expression , one is led to state that the zeroes of @xmath145 should be independent of the parameter @xmath3 , due to the presence of @xmath145 itself in the right hand side of eq .  .",
    "evidently , this is true provided the factor @xmath144 is not too singular at the zero of @xmath145 , so as to compensate the zero itself .",
    "this is a not so evident question for which , to our knowledge , no complete answer based on ward identities is available so far .",
    "it is therefore useful to outline some argument in favour of the absence of unwanted singularities in the quantity @xmath144 .",
    "as shown in appendix [ apdd ] , the quantity @xmath144 can be rewritten as @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the form factors of the fourier transform of the connected two - point green functions @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "thus , the nielsen identity becomes @xmath151 which turns out to be quite useful for an order by order feynman diagrammatic analysis .",
    "let us first focus on the term @xmath152 , which is already present in standard yang - mills theory @xcite . in order to have a compensation at the zero of @xmath153",
    ", the connected green function @xmath154 should develop a double pole , which seems unlikely to happen , at least in an order by order feynman diagram expansion .",
    "this reasoning is also supported by explicit one loop calculations in ordinary yang - mills theory @xcite , where the quantity @xmath154 indeed does not develop a double pole .",
    "a similar argument applies as well to the second term @xmath155 . in summary , in the following we shall assume that the quantity @xmath144 is not too singular to compensate the zeroes of @xmath153 .",
    "though , an explicit proof valid to all orders of this statement remains to be worked out , even for standard perturbative qcd .    before ending this section",
    ", it is worth emphasizing that the auxiliary fields @xmath156 of the gribov - zwanziger action , @xmath45 , eq .",
    ", develop their own dynamics , giving rise to additional non - perturbative effects encoded in the formation of brst invariant dimension two condensates @xmath157 and @xmath158 . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "taking into account the existence of the aforementioned dimension two condensates , leads to a refinement of the gribov - zwanziger theory , whose action is given by @xmath159 where @xmath45 is the gribov - zwanziger action of eq .   and where , as much as the gribov parameter @xmath160 , the parameters @xmath161 , corresponding to the condensates @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively , are determined in a self - consistent way by suitable gap equations @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the starting action @xmath63 , eq .  ,",
    "gets modified into its refined version @xmath164 which gives rise to the following tree - level gluon propagator @xcite @xmath165 one observes that the transverse component of expression is suppressed in the infrared region , attaining a non - vanishing value at @xmath166 , while the longitudinal component still coincides with the usual perturbative expression of the linear covariant gauges .",
    "remarkably , expression is in good qualitative agreement with the most recent lattice data on the two - point gluon correlation functions , see @xcite .",
    "the brst invariance and the associated slavnov - taylor identities generalize straightforwardly to the refined action @xmath167 , eq .  .",
    "in particular , the nielsen identity also holds in the refined case .",
    "it is possible to provide a unifying description of the @xmath3-dependence of the poles of the mixed propagators .",
    "we depart again from the action in eq .   and set @xmath168 then it is straightforward to check that in the action , we can replace @xmath169 as the residual terms in @xmath170 can be reabsorbed by a harmless shift of the field @xmath59 .    for the rest of this subsection",

    "eventually , we thus obtain @xmath244 the fair simplicity of this final expression can be understood from the gauge invariance of the propagator @xmath245 .",
    "we recall that @xmath212 is a brst invariant field . as such",
    ", it must hold that @xmath246 .",
    "from @xmath247 we get @xmath248 or @xmath249 which implies the desired result that the zeroes of @xmath250 are @xmath3-independent .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the zeroes of the @xmath88 matrix @xmath224 will in general produce poles in all propagators @xmath219 , @xmath251 and @xmath245 .",
    "as the poles of the latter are gauge invariant per construction , this observation already strongly suggests that the zeroes of @xmath252 will also be gauge invariant , even without using the nielsen identities .",
    "however , we were unable to rule out on general grounds cancellations of possible gauge variant zeroes of @xmath253 with compensating zeroes in the elements of @xmath224 .",
    "this necessitated the lengthy nielsen analysis just presented .",
    "another well - known interesting property , next to the gauge parameter independence , is the renormalization group invariance of the pole mass(es ) .",
    "we first point out that @xmath253 will also obey the renormalization group equation if @xmath224 does as @xmath254 the pole masses were identified as the zeroes of @xmath255 , so working around such zero @xmath227 , with @xmath256 , we immediately get from the foregoing equation that @xmath257 hence @xmath258      formally , the gribov horizon can be removed from the theory by setting @xmath81 , in which case the auxiliary fields can be integrated out , yielding a unity .",
    "when @xmath81 , the action reduces to the brst invariant massive model studied recently in @xcite , namely @xmath259 this model can be regarded as the generalization to the linear covariant gauges of the effective massive model introduced in the landau gauge in @xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath260 , one is back to the case of standard yang - mills theory , albeit supplemented with a mass term , leading to @xmath261 so that eq .",
    "becomes @xmath262 which is nothing but the usual nielsen identity of the standard yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "let now @xmath263 denote the pole of the transverse part of the gluon propagator , i.e. @xmath264 thus , the nielsen identity becomes @xmath265 implying that the pole mass @xmath263 of the transverse component of the gluon propagator @xmath266 is independent of the gauge parameter @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the pole mass in the landau gauge version of eq .   was studied in @xcite .",
    "as we have just shown for the gz case , and as it is well known in general , nielsen identities are a direct consequence of the underlying brst invariance of the theory and they allow to control the gauge parameter dependence of gauge variant quantities .    there is another class of relations , commonly known as the landau - khalatnikov - fradkin ( lkf ) transformations , that dictate how to connect @xmath267-point functions in different gauges @xcite . at the level of practical usage , the lkf transformation",
    "are usually restricted to the qed fermion propagator , see @xcite for useful references . nonetheless , also for the qcd case",
    ", some progress has recently been made for the quark propagator up to a certain order in perturbation theory , see @xcite .    in @xcite , it was observed that , at least for the qed case , the lkf transformations can be derived from brst invariance as well , by introducing an auxiliary stueckelberg field .",
    "this strengthens our intuition that nielsen identities and lkf transformations should be related in some way , as at the end , both are consequences of brst invariance .",
    "schematically , a nielsen identity for a connected two - point function in the absence of mixing looks like @xmath268 where @xmath269 corresponds to the analogue of the composite operator correlation function @xmath270 .",
    "then we can write @xmath271 which can be solved for by @xmath272 this is an lkf transformation , in the sense that the two - point function at @xmath3 is given by transforming the two - point function at @xmath12 ( landau gauge ) with some suitable form factor @xmath273 .",
    "let us discuss this here in some more detail for the abelian case , i.e.  qed , and the photon propagator . for qed , we do not even need to worry about the gribov problem .",
    "we thus consider the abelian limit of the extended gauge fixing and add the dirac action for the fermions , so that @xmath274 considering next the abelian limit of the sti for the generator @xmath275 of connected green functions , eq .   and",
    "acting on it with the appropriate test operator , we get for the nielsen identity of the photon propagator @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the abelian analogue of @xmath278 , but now immediately at the connected level .    in the abelian case ,",
    "this form factor @xmath279 can be computed in a closed form , since @xmath280 , @xmath281 and @xmath282 are free fields . indeed , as @xmath283 and @xmath284",

    "if we contract @xmath282 with an @xmath291 from a vertex , we trivially get zero since this amounts to a contraction between a momentum and a ( conserved ) dirac current .    the final resolution of the photon nielsen identity , eq .  , is nothing else but the photon lkf transformation .",
    "the solution to the eq .",
    "is , after integration , exactly given by the lkf relation @xmath292 of course , in the non - abelian case , the situation gets more complicated , since the r.h.s .  of the gluon nielsen identity depends on @xmath293 , which can not be evaluated in an exact form anymore .",
    "this also means that the corresponding lkf relation , obtainable by integrating the nielsen identity , can no longer be written in a closed form and one needs to resort to an approximation .",
    "this is exactly what is done , to a few orders in perturbation theory , in @xcite for the quark propagator .",

    "we will report on the non - abelian generalization of the lkf transformations and the link with the nielsen identities for both gluon and fermion @xmath267-point functions in more detail elsewhere , with attention for the manifest renormalizability of the construction .",
    "let us end this subsection by mentioning that , in principle , one can also derive lkf transformations for the mixed propagators in the gz case by integrating the corresponding nielsen identities , which gives a way to `` move '' from the landau gauge results to those of a general linear covariant gauge .",

    ", it would be interesting to study the behaviour of the propagator @xmath380 in a lattice setting . +",
    "as our propagator is explicitly brst invariant , we can try to make a connection with recent works @xcite which introduced a gauge invariant perturbation theory , based on the ideas of @xcite , see also @xcite .",

    "no local observable can discriminate between a higgs or confining phase .",
    "said otherwise , it is always possible to connect the higgs and confining `` phase '' in an analytical way .",
    "other part of the motivation is that of constructing the physical spectrum of the theory .",
    "for such a goal , one should consider , as appropriate for a gauge theory , gauge invariant bound state operators and identify their poles to get a gauge invariant description of massive gauge bosons , see @xcite .",
    "coming back to the fradkin - shenker result , one might expect that the ensuing spectrum can then `` interpolate '' in an analytical way between the expected higgs and confined behaviour of the physical degrees of freedom .",
    "the gauge invariant perturbation theory comes in about when , after choosing a gauge with associated vev for the higgs field , one can expand the connected two - point function of the gauge invariant bound state operator in terms of a two - point function of the standard gauge dependent fields and higher order scattering contributions . in our case , we can do a similar thing , i.e.  we can write , in any gauge , @xmath381 based on the expansion .",

    "in this paper , we have exploited the recently introduced , @xcite , brst invariant , nonperturbative generalization of the linear covariant gauges , which takes into partial account the gribov ambiguity which hampers the standard faddeev - popov gauge fixing procedure .",
    "thanks to the ( local ) brst invariance and ensuing slavnov - taylor identity , we were able to derive a set of nielsen identities for the mixed propagators of this novel gribov - zwanziger formulation of the linear covariant gauge , which encompasses the widely studied landau gauge as a special case .",
    "a major result at the level of the transverse form factor of the connected gluon propagator is a proof , based on the nielsen identities , of the gauge parameter independence of its ( complex conjugate ) poles . as a byproduct of our analysis",
    ", we digressed to some extent how the landau - khalatnikov - fradkin transformations are related to the nielsen identities .",
    "in addition , we also paid attention to the connected two - point function of a transverse , brst invariant gluon field , @xmath21 , that enters the formulation .",
    "despite the fact that it corresponds to an infinite series of increasingly nonlocal composite operators , it can be handled with the tools of local quantum field theory after the introduction of suitable auxiliary fields .",
    "its two - point function was shown to be exactly equal to the standard gluon propagator in the landau gauge , and given the nielsen identity proof , thereby linking its gauge invariant poles to those of the gluon propagator in any linear covariant gauge .",
    "we then used this brst invariant correlator to study , in a now gauge invariant fashion , the violation of positivity in the gluon sector .",
    "although not a proof of confinement , this is seen by many practitioners in the field as an effective consequence of confinement : there are no observable elementary gluon excitations in the asymptotic @xmath384-matrix spectrum .",
    "of course , next to the elementary gluon degrees of freedom discussed in this paper , qcd also implies confined , or at least unobservable , quarks and ghosts . in forthcoming work",
    ", we will extend the tools and results of this paper to the quark and ghost sector .",
    "for the quark sector , we have in mind a brst invariant extension of the preliminary landau gauge models discussed in @xcite that describe a quark propagator with a complex conjugate pole structure , in accordance with lattice fits reported in the literature @xcite . in general , a relatively simple parametrization of the quark propagator in terms of pairs of complex conjugate , and thus unphysical , poles has been proven to be rather successful to grasp key features of the qcd spectrum in terms of solutions of the bethe - salpeter equations , let us for instance refer to @xcite .",
    "one might be worried about the occurrence of complex poles in relation to unitarity , the latter at least for the bound state spectrum of the `` complex '' constituents .",
    "this is an open question and certainly deserves further study . that unitarity is not necessarily at odds with complex poles in propagators can be appreciated from @xcite , where an explicit recipe , motivated by the lee - wick model @xcite was given to ensure unitarity ( and lorentz covariance ) , order by order in a feynman diagrammatic expansion , when pairs of complex conjugate poles are introduced into the theory",
    "more recent applications and insights can be found in @xcite .",
    "this might be an interesting avenue to explore in relation with the complex poles induced by the gribov - zwanziger quantization scheme .",
    "in the ghost sector , the nielsen identities and its possible consequences may in particular shed some light on the ghost propagator in the linear covariant gauge that for the gauge parameter @xmath385 has a quite different behaviour compared to the distinct @xmath12 ( landau gauge ) case , at least as reported in @xcite .",
    "we want to stress that understanding key nonperturbative features of the @xmath267-point functions of qcd for a general class of gauges is more than just of academic interest .",
    "these @xmath267-point functions are the key ingredients in constructing the qcd spectrum , see @xcite .",
    "so far , such analyses have been restricted to landau gauge for reasons of simplicity . however , depending on the specific approaches , a lot of modeling , in the form of anstze for the interaction vertices , are required .",
    "frequently , even the input propagators are modelled with desirable , simplifying forms ( see e.g.  @xcite for an overview and relevant references ) . as such , the true gauge invariant nature of the results becomes clouded , since the anstze are usually rather specific to landau gauge and engineered to reproduce certain features of the experimental spectrum .",
    "a truly ab initio computation of the qcd spectrum should display a clean gauge invariant nature , ultimately controlled by the brst invariance when a gauge fixing is employed .",
    "our work , in addition to that of other approaches as those of @xcite can be seen as a first , small step towards this , as at first one needs to understand the two - point functions .",
    "one final piece of our future effort should be dedicated to a more formal aspect of brst invariant gauge field theories : to what extent can the new brst invariance of the current nonperturbative formulation of the linear covariant gauges be used to introduce a well - defined global brst charge acting on the hilbert space , and if so , is it still possible to derive a confinement criterion in the sense of ensuring the absence of colored asymptotic states from the physical brst state cohomology ? almost needless to say",

    "we provide here a second proof of the independence from the gauge parameter @xmath3 of the poles of the transverse component @xmath430 of the gluon propagator . in a quantum field theory which does not have mixed propagators of different fields , eq .",
    "( [ dt ] ) implies , essentially , that the @xmath88 two - point function is the inverse of the connected two - point function",
    ". an immediate consequence of this fact is that the poles of the connected two - point function coincide with the zeroes of the corresponding @xmath88 two - point function .",
    "therefore , in this simple case , if one is able to prove that the zero / pole of the @xmath88/connected two - point function is independent of the gauge parameter @xmath3 , the independence from the gauge parameter of the pole / zero of the connected/@xmath88 two - point function is a direct consequence .",
    "nevertheless , as long as theories with mixed propagators are considered , these properties are lost and one has to be more careful in the analysis of the gauge independence of the poles / zeroes of the connected/@xmath88 two - point functions . in the present case , we are dealing with the gribov - zwanziger action which has a large number of fields and of non - trivial mixed propagators , see @xcite .",
    "however , we were able to derive the identity which tells us that if at @xmath431 the two - point function @xmath432 vanishes and the insertion @xmath433 is not too singular , then the zero @xmath434 is independent of @xmath3 , namely ,    @xmath435    although the @xmath3-independence of the zero of @xmath436 is controlled by , one could be interested on the @xmath3-independence of the poles of the connected two - point function @xmath430 . for this",
    ", let us assume that the pole of @xmath430 is located at @xmath437 and we split our analysis in two cases :    1",
    ".   the pole of @xmath430 does not coincide with the pole of @xmath438 : + in this case , we consider eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) at the pole @xmath439 , namely @xmath440 by assumption , @xmath441 while @xmath442 . since @xmath443 and @xmath444 are not singular at the pole @xmath445 , a property which can be shown in a way completely similar as done below eq .  ,",
    "the only way the l.h.s .  of eq .   could produce a finite value is by setting @xmath446 .",
    "this implies that the pole of @xmath430 coincides with the zero of @xmath436 and by eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) it is @xmath3-independent .",
    "the pole of @xmath430 is the same as the pole of @xmath438 : [ apd ] + for this situation , we consider the following expression @xmath447 which is derived from eq .",
    "( [ dt ] ) by setting @xmath448 , @xmath449 and applying the transverse projector on lorentz indices . to proceed with the analysis",
    ", we subdivide the argument in two cases : * the pole of @xmath450 is the same as the pole of @xmath451 and/or the pole of @xmath452 ; + as showed in eq .",
    "( [ ia ] ) , the two - point functions @xmath451 and @xmath452 are @xmath3-independent , as a consequence of brst invariance . as such",
    ", their poles are also @xmath3-independent and , thus , the pole of @xmath450 is also @xmath3-independent . by assumption , this pole is the same as the pole of @xmath430 .",
    "hence , the pole of @xmath430 is independent of @xmath3 . *",
    "the pole of @xmath450 is different from the poles of @xmath451 and @xmath452 .",
    "+ in this case , @xmath453 and @xmath454 .",
    "also , @xmath455 and @xmath456 are not singular . since @xmath457 , the only way the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ r3 ] ) can produce a finite value is if @xmath458 .",
    "assuming thus that @xmath459 is not too singular , we conclude that @xmath460 is @xmath3-independent .    in summary ,",
    "if the zeroes of @xmath436 are gauge parameter independent then the poles of @xmath430 also are .",
    "as already underlined , the nielsen identity ( [ nn2 ] ) ensures the gauge parameter independence of the zeroes of @xmath436 if the insertion @xmath433 is not too singular at the zero . in this appendix",
    "we work out an expression for such insertion in terms of connected green functions which turns out to be quite helpful for investigating the nature of @xmath436 .    to begin with , we write the insertion as @xmath461 and we have to act with the transverse projector on eq .",
    "( [ ins1 ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ zc ] ) , we write @xmath462 applying the functional chain rule , we obtain @xmath463 applying the the transverse projector @xmath464 and taking into account color invariance and ghost number conservation , expression ( [ ins3 ] ) reduces to @xmath465\\ , , \\label{ins4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath466 denoting the connected correlation functions . passing to fourier space gives @xmath467 where @xmath468 and @xmath469 are the fourier transformations of the transverse components of the connected green functions @xmath149 and @xmath470 . from the decompositions @xmath471 eq .",
    "becomes @xmath472 which is useful for a better understanding of the nielsen identity ( [ nn2 ] ) .",
