    "the light curves produced by many types of all - sky monitor do not have uniform errors .",
    "for example , the pointing direction of the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on swift is determined by observations using the narrow - field instruments also onboard swift which are primarily used to study gamma - ray bursts and their afterglows .",
    "bat observations of x - ray sources are thus generally obtained in an unpredictable fashion .",
    "the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on board rxte also suffers from similar problems . even though the rxte asm is controlled to make observations of the sky as complete as possible",
    ", there is still considerable non - uniformity . the quality of observations of any particular point on the sky will depend on the observation duration and the location of that point in a detector field of view if there is non - uniform response across the fov .",
    "scargle ( 1989 ) proposed that the effect of unequally weighted data points in a power spectrum can be found by considering two points that coincide and treating this as a single point of double weight .",
    "a `` natural '' approach to combining data points of different error bar size is to use the weighted mean .",
    "this approach can be considered as calculating the power spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "although this procedure is very effective for faint sources , if the scatter in data values is large compared to the error bar sizes weighting by error bars can be inappropriate .",
    "this is because the concept of combining `` coincident '' points must be treated carefully . in a power spectrum",
    "it is not just points at the same time , but points at the same phase , which are combined .",
    "if there is a strong signal then , at all frequencies except the modulation frequency , we will be combining points with discrepant values and hence the weighted mean will not be valid .",
    "a refinement is to treat source variability as an additional `` error''@xcite , i.e. calculate the power spectrum of @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a correction to nominal error bar size and @xmath4 is the estimated variance due to source variability .",
    "this procedure is related to the semi - weighted mean , @xcite and hence may be termed `` semi - weighting''@xcite .",
    "semi - weighting works well for sources across a wide range of brightness , providing that the correction factor @xmath3 is applied , and gives improvements for swift bat@xcite , rxte asm and cgro batse light curves ( fig .",
    "the glast lat@xcite is also a large field of view detector , and it will provide a sensitive survey of the @xmath0-ray sky . it is expected that glast will predominantly operate in a sky survey mode which will give much more uniform sky coverage than with the rxte asm or swift bat",
    ". however , precession of glast s orbit will affect the exposure of each point on the sky . in order for weighting to improve period searches",
    "two conditions must be met : the signal amplitude should not be very much larger than typical error bar size , and the sizes of the errors on data points in light curves must have considerable variation . if these conditions are not met then , although weighting may still be used , it will not have a significant benefit . to investigate whether weighting will be beneficial for glast we used simulated light curves of @xmath0-ray binaries that have been presented elsewhere@xcite with 1 day or 90 minute binning . for light curves accumulated in 1 day bins ,",
    "sky coverage was sufficiently uniform that weighting gave no improvement .",
    "the 90 minute time bins were not synchronized to glast s orbital period which produced large changes in exposure from bin to bin .",
    "for these bins the number of photons was low and we calculated asymmetric error bars based on pearson s @xmath5@xcite .",
    "we investigated several symmetrization schemes to convert error bars to a single weighting factor@xcite .",
    "it was found that weighting gave very strong benefits for period detection . of the symmetrization methods investigated , the use of just the larger ( upper ) error bar on data points gave the strongest gain in signal detection",
    ". however , no conversion method gave results that could be used in semi - weighting as the predicted source variability variance values were not well defined ."
