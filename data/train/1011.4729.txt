    "it is fair to mention that various instabilities other than strange mode instability are also proposed for the cause of eruptive mass loss ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "in the present paper (  [ sec : secular ] ) we will discuss the presence of a monotonously unstable mode in models more luminous than the hd limit .",
    "in addition to the major variations ( sd - eruptions and sd - phases ) on timescales of years and decades , lbvs show quasi - periodic microvariations on timescales of weeks to months .",
    "those variations occur also in non - lbv luminous oba supergiants .",
    "they are loosely called @xmath3 cyg variables , and the variations are thought to be caused by stellar oscillations . @xcite and @xcite claimed these microvariations to be caused by radial strange mode pulsations .",
    "@xcite argued , however , that periods of some of the microvariations in lbvs are much longer than the periods of strange modes , and that the positions of some of those variables on the hr diagram contradict the strange mode instability region .",
    "they concluded microvariations in lbvs to be consistent with nonradial g - modes .    in the present paper , we find those longer period variations can be interpreted by oscillatory convection ( nonadiabatic g@xmath1 ) modes associated with the envelope convection zone generated by the fe - opacity peak around @xmath6k .",
    "the linear convection modes , which are dynamically ( monotonously ) unstable in the adiabatic analysis ( g@xmath1-modes ) , become overstable ( or oscillatory ) if nonadiabatic effects are included as found by @xcite for high - degree ( @xmath7 ) modes .",

    "some of these variations can be interpreted as supergiant extension of spb stars ( spbsg ) , which is possible because g - mode oscillations being reflected at a convection zone above a hydrogen burning shell so that strong dissipation in the core is suppressed @xcite .",

    "<S> in order to understand the periodic and semi - periodic variations of luminous o- b- a - type stars , linear nonadiabatic stability analyses for radial and nonradial oscillations have been performed for massive evolutionary models ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to radial and nonradial oscillations excited by the kappa - mechanism and strange - mode instability , we discuss the importance of low - degree oscillatory convection ( nonadiabatic g@xmath1 ) modes . </S>",
    "<S> although their kinetic energy is largely confined to the convection zone generated by the fe opacity peak near @xmath2k , the amplitude can emerge to the photosphere and should be observable in a certain effective temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> they have periods longer than those of the radial strange modes so that they seem to be responsible for some of the long - period microvariations of lbvs ( s dor variables ) and @xmath3 cyg variables . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , monotonously unstable radial modes are found in some models whose initial masses are greater than or equal to @xmath4 with @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the monotonous instability probably corresponds to the presence of an optically thick wind . </S>",
    "<S> the instability boundary roughly coincides with the humphreys - davidson limit .    </S>",
