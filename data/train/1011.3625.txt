    "to address the issue of anomalous acceleration of test - particles in the gravitational field of a central object we first simplify the underlying theory as much as possible .",
    "we assume that spacetime is described by a spherically symmetric metric in four dimensions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath0 the 2-dimensional metric @xmath1 and the surface radius @xmath2 depend only on the coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "our task is now clear : we should describe the dynamics of the fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is possible to do this in two dimensions , since the metric @xmath6 and the scalar field @xmath5 are both intrinsically 2-dimensional objects .",
    "each solution of the equations of motion ( eom ) of that 2-dimensional theory leads to a 4-dimensional line - element , so the former faithfully captures the classical dynamics of the latter .",
    "the test - particles are then assumed to move in the background of the 4-dimensional line - element .",
    "the process of `` spherical reduction '' @xcite simplifies the 4-dimensional einstein  hilbert action to a specific 2-dimensional dilaton gravity model , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the novelty of our approach is that we allow for ir modifications of the dilaton gravity model .",
    "we explain now in detail how this works .",
    "we construct the most general 2-dimensional theory with the field content @xmath6 and @xmath5 compatible with the following assumptions .",
    "first of all , we require the theory to be power - counting renormalizable , assuming that non - renormalizable terms are suppressed .",
    "this leads uniquely to the action @xcite @xmath7   \\label{eq : rind2}\\ ] ] we have exploited field redefinitions to bring the kinetic term for the dilaton field @xmath5 into a convenient form .",
    "the gravitational coupling constant @xmath8 does not play any essential role in our discussions .",
    "we assume that the free functions @xmath9 are analytic in @xmath5 in the limit of large @xmath5 , like in spherically reduced gr @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the eom ( see below ) reveals that the coupling function @xmath10 that multiplies the ricci scalar @xmath11 must be given by @xmath12 is allowed .",
    "however , the @xmath13 term can be eliminated by a constant shift of @xmath5 , the @xmath14 term does not contribute to the eom and the subleading terms can be neglected in the ir . ] to reproduce the newton potential @xmath15 .",
    "if we considered instead @xmath16 then the potential would change to @xmath17 .",
    "an experimental bound on @xmath18 is @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "changing the power of @xmath5 in the function @xmath10 would be even more drastic , leading to exponential growth or decay of the potential . in this work",
    "we make the conservative assumption that @xmath12 is not renormalized in the ir , in excellent agreement with the experimental data .    we still have to choose the potential @xmath20 in the action . in the 4-dimensional language we consider large surface areas around some central object .",
    "after spherical reduction the limit of large surface areas leads to the limit of large dilaton field @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the potential @xmath20 behaves as follows : @xmath21 the ansatz for the potential @xmath20 is pivotal for the discussion , so let us pause and explain the rationale behind it . that the leading term in the large @xmath5-expansion is quadratic follows from physics : if we did allow for powers higher than @xmath22 then the ensuing metric would have a curvature singularity for large @xmath5 .",
    "thus , is the generic asymptotic result provided we require the absence of curvature singularities and analyticity in @xmath5 in the ir , which is what we do .",
    "the term @xmath23 leads to a contribution to the gravitational potential proportional to @xmath24 , whose effects are subleading in the deep ir as compared to effects coming from the first three terms in .",
    "therefore , we ignore this term ( and further subleading terms).-term in the gravitational potential has a fall - off behavior comparable to the newton term , but is logarithmically larger .",
    "thus , for comparison with precision data it may be worthwhile to take it into account , even though it is suppressed by a factor @xmath25 as compared to the rindler term . the next subleading term in the gravitational potential is a reissner ",
    "nordstrm term , which can safely be neglected in the ir .",
    "further subleading terms correspond not to ir but rather to uv modifications . ] by rescaling simultaneously @xmath5 and @xmath8 we can fix one of the subleading coefficients in the asymptotic potential , which amounts to fixing a specific physical length scale . without loss of generality",
    "we choose @xmath26 . dropping all asymptotically subleading terms and",
    "choosing convenient normalizations of the coupling constants as well as @xmath27 the action simplifies to @xmath28   \\label{eq : rind6}\\ ] ] the action is our first key result .",
    "it provides the generic effective theory of gravity in the ir consistent with the assumptions spelled out above .",
    "the theory defined by the action depends on two coupling constants , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "solutions of the eom descending from the action describe spherically symmetric line elements that model gravity in the ir .",
    "it is straightforward to find all solutions to the eom @xmath31 derived from the action .",
    "the result is   @xmath32 the line - element exhibits a killing vector @xmath33 with norm @xmath34 given by .",
    "the 2-dimensional ricci scalar @xmath35 only depends on @xmath29 and on @xmath36 , but not on @xmath30 .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 is a constant of motion . if @xmath37 we recover the schwarzschild solution with @xmath36 being the black hole mass .",
    "if @xmath38 we have additionally a cosmological constant . if @xmath39 we obtain a contribution to the killing norm @xmath34 that does not arise in vacuum einstein gravity .",
    "the geometric meaning of this new term is clear @xcite : it generates rindler acceleration . indeed , for @xmath40 the line - element is the 2-dimensional rindler metric @xcite .",
    "thus , our effective field theory that describes gravity in the ir differs in one aspect from gr : it allows for an arbitrary rindler acceleration term .",
    "this is our second key result . , namely to require the action to be symmetric under @xmath41 .",
    "however , there is no _ a priori _ reason for this symmetry . ]",
    "we take now the presence of the rindler term in for granted and discuss some of its physical consequences .",
    "the cosmological constant is given by @xmath42 @xcite , and this is the value we shall be using , though in several applications we set @xmath43 for simplicity .",
    "note that we are employing natural units @xmath44 .",
    "the rindler acceleration @xmath30 in principle may depend on the scales of the system under consideration .",
    "we motivate now an order of magnitude estimate for @xmath30 in the deep ir .",
    "the product @xmath45 that enters the killing norm becomes order of unity if @xmath46 is of the order of the radius of the visible universe .",
    "if we suppose that the same happens for the @xmath47-term then we obtain the estimate @xmath48 , which is approximately the scale were anomalous accelerations are observed : the mond acceleration is about @xmath49 @xcite and the pioneer acceleration is about @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we study now geodesics of timelike test - particles ( of unit mass ) propagating on the 4-dimensional background determined by the spherically symmetric line element with - . consider for simplicity motion in the plane @xmath51 . using standard methods",
    "@xcite we obtain the well - known result @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the conserved angular momentum , and @xmath54 with @xmath55 the effective potential reads @xmath56 the first term in @xmath57 is the newton potential , the second the centrifugal barrier , the third the gr correction , the fourth a cosmic acceleration term and the last term proportional to the rindler acceleration @xmath30 is novel . for vanishing cosmological constant and vanishing angular momentum the force @xmath58 derived from the effective potential contains only two terms .",
    "@xmath59 thus , for very small newton potentials the rindler acceleration term becomes relevant and provides a constant acceleration towards the source ( if @xmath30 is positive ) or away from the source ( if @xmath30 is negative ) .",
    "this effect becomes important at sufficiently large distances only .      in the newtonian limit",
    "the velocity profile is determined from the mass by @xmath60 , where we assume some radial mass profile @xmath61 and set to zero the cosmological constant and the rindler acceleration .",
    "if we take into account also the rindler acceleration we obtain a new formula for the radial velocity profile in a galaxy : @xmath62 let us now construct a rough model of galaxies , starting with dwarf galaxies .",
    "we assume that the density is constant in the center up to @xmath63 ( less than a kiloparsec ) and drops to zero thereafter . for a total mass of @xmath64 solar masses we obtain from the velocity profile depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the dashed line gives the keplerian velocity profile and the solid line gives the velocity profile deduced from with @xmath65 .",
    "strikingly , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] resembles the rotation curves for dwarf galaxies , see e.g.  @xcite . to describe large galaxies we assume that the density is constant in the center up to @xmath66 ( about 3 kiloparsecs ) and drops to zero thereafter . for a total mass of @xmath67 solar masses we obtain from the velocity profile depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the dashed line gives the keplerian velocity profile and the solid line gives the velocity profile deduced from , again with @xmath65 .",
    "strikingly , fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] resembles the rotation curves for large ( spiral ) galaxies , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the scale where the velocity profile flattens is @xmath68 , which roughly corresponds to @xmath69 , in reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that the velocity profile was studied on purely phenomenological grounds , see eq .",
    "( 125 ) in @xcite in section 6.3 ( `` clues from data '' ) .",
    "it is gratifying that the effective field theory predicts a velocity profile that was argued to be a good phenomenological fit to the data   is a prescribed constant , in mannheim s work it consists of two terms , one of which is also a prescribed constant , while the other scales with the number of stars in the galaxy .",
    "the latter contribution does not arise in our scenario since we have assumed for simplicity that @xmath30 takes the same value in all galaxies .",
    "we can drop this assumption and recover precisely mannheim s fit if we assume that @xmath30 depends on the scales of the system under consideration , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of stars in the galaxy . for",
    "dwarf galaxies the contribution coming from @xmath72 does not play any role , while for large galaxies it plays only a modest role . ] .",
    "we note , however , that so far there is no empirical hint that generically rotation curves of galaxies rise linearly at large distances , see e.g.  @xcite , so one has to take this rough model of galaxies with a few grains of salt . of course , allowing for an @xmath46-dependent function @xmath30 in one can fit any given rotation curve .",
    "it could be a rewarding exercise to perform such fits to the data , thereby determining the rindler acceleration @xmath30 as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "physics in the solar system appears to be well - understood .",
    "nevertheless , there are a few tentative anomalies like fly - by anomalies and the pioneer anomaly , for a review cf .",
    "the force law leads to an anomalous constant acceleration towards the sun ( if @xmath30 is positive ) .",
    "interestingly , this effect has been observed by the pioneer spacecraft @xcite .",
    "taking the data at face value requires to fix @xmath73 , which is not that different from the value of @xmath30 used in the toy model for galaxies above . even though there is still room for doubt",
    "if the pioneer anomaly is a genuine effect @xcite , it is striking that our effective field theory is capable to account for it .",
    "it is notoriously difficult to reconcile modifications of gravitational theories that explain , for instance , the pioneer anomaly without spoiling solar system precision tests @xcite .",
    "our rindler acceleration term does not necessarily spoil the solar - system precision tests , since the value of @xmath30 depends on the system that we describe .",
    "for instance , in the system galaxy / sun @xmath65 , in the system sun / mercury @xmath30 may be much smaller , in the system sun / pioneer spacecraft @xmath73 , and in the system earth / satellite @xmath30 may be much bigger .",
    "it is a challenging open issue to understand precisely what determines the scale of @xmath30 .",
    "it is unlikely that such an understanding can be achieved within our 2-dimensional effective model .",
    "the viewpoint taken so far was that the effective theory for gravity in the ir is a 2-dimensional scalar - tensor theory , whose solutions of the ( vacuum ) eom lead to 4-dimensional spherically symmetric metrics with - .",
    "following this philosophy we derived above some remarkable consequences .",
    "one issue , however , is not entirely satisfactory : we had to take a detour via spherical reduction to two dimensions to establish our results .",
    "it would be interesting to derive  or at least to interpret  the same results directly in four dimensions .",
    "such a top - down derivation is accessible only by reintroducing model assumptions that lift the agnosticism of the current approach . in the present work we confine ourselves to possible 4-dimensional interpretations of the 2-dimensional rindler acceleration .",
    "therefore , we pose now the question what kind of field equations are obeyed in four dimensions by metrics of type with - .",
    "obviously , any metric can formally be written as a solution to einstein s equations with some suitable energy momentum tensor .",
    "@xmath74 in our case this effective energy momentum tensor turns out to be like the one of an anisotropic fluid @xmath75 with density @xmath76 , radial ( @xmath77 ) and tangential ( @xmath78 ) pressure @xmath79 note that our effective fluid does not behave at all like a cold dark matter fluid modelled by dust ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "we stress that there is only one free parameter in our effective fluid description  the rindler acceleration @xmath30 . the dominant energy condition @xcite holds , provided that @xmath30 is negative .",
    "we found above that this is not the sign needed to model the galactic rotation curves and the pioneer anomaly . taking the fluid interpretation",
    "literally , we predict an unusual equation of state for dark matter that could be tested by combining gravitational lensing and rotation curve data , as explained in ref .",
    "this could provide the simplest route to falsify our model .      whether the anisotropic fluid , is `` real '' in any sense or just an effective way to incorporate ir effects ( that either accumulate within gr or that follow from some modification of gr ) is of considerable theoretical interest , but goes beyond the scope of the current letter .",
    "still , we mention an intriguing factoid : the most general spherically symmetric solution to @xmath81 or to @xmath82 or to the eom arising in conformal weyl gravity @xcite is given by our solution , - [ in the first case supplemented by a reissner  nordstrm term @xmath83 in the killing norm ] . in all three cases",
    "the rindler acceleration @xmath30 emerges as a constant of motion and therefore naturally depends on the specific system under consideration .",
    "i thank alan guth , roman jackiw , wolfgang kummer , philip mannheim , stacy mcgaugh , florian preis , dimitri vassilevich and richard woodard for discussions .",
    "i am grateful to herbert balasin and tonguc rador for independently pointing out an incorrect sign in eq .  ."
