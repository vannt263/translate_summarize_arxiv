    "quadratic fields were proposed as a setting for public - key cryptosystems in the late 1980s by buchmann and williams @xcite .",
    "there are two types of quadratic fields , imaginary and real . in the imaginary case ,",
    "cryptosystems are based on arithmetic in the ideal class group ( a finite abelian group ) , and the discrete logarithm problem is the computational problem on which the security is based . in the real case ,",
    "the so - called infrastructure is used instead , and the security is based on the analogue of the discrete logarithm problem in this structure , namely the principal ideal problem .    although neither of these problems is resistant to quantum computers , cryptography in quadratic fields is nevertheless an interesting alternative to more widely - used settings .",
    "both discrete logarithm problems can be solved in subexponential time using index calculus algorithms , but with asymptotically slower complexity than the state - of - the art algorithms for integer factorization and computing discrete logarithms in finite fields .",
    "in addition , the only known relationship to the quadratic field discrete logarithm problems from other computational problems used in cryptography is that integer factorization reduces to both of the quadratic field problems .",
    "thus , both of these are at least as hard as factoring , and the lack of known relationships to other computational problems implies that the breaking of other cryptosystems , such as those based on elliptic or hyperelliptic curves , will not necessarily break those set in quadratic fields .",
    "examining the security of quadratic field based cryptosystems is therefore of interest .",
    "the fastest algorithms for solving discrete logarithm problem in quadratic fields are based on an improved version of buchmann s index - calculus algorithm due to jacobson @xcite .",
    "the algorithms include a number of practical enhancements to the original algorithm of buchmann @xcite , including the use of self - initialized sieving to generate relations , a single large prime variant , and practice - oriented algorithms for the required linear algebra .",
    "these algorithms enabled the computation of a discrete logarithm in the class group of an imaginary quadratic field with @xmath5 decimal digit discriminant @xcite , and the solution of the principal ideal problem for a real quadratic field with @xmath6 decimal digit discriminant @xcite .    since this work , a number of further improvements have been proposed .",
    "biasse @xcite presented practical improvements to the corresponding algorithm for imaginary quadratic fields , including a double large prime variant and improved algorithms for the required linear algebra .",
    "the resulting algorithm was indeed faster then the previous state - of - the - art and enabled the computation of the ideal class group of an imaginary quadratic field with @xmath7 decimal digit discriminant .",
    "these improvements were adapted to the case of real quadratic fields by biasse and jacobson @xcite , along with the incorporation of a batch smoothness test of bernstein @xcite , resulting in similar speed - ups in that case .    in this paper , we adapt the improvements of biasse and jacobson to the computation of discrete logarithms in the class group of an imaginary quadratic field and the principal ideal problem in the infrastructure of a real quadratic field .",
    "we use versions of the algorithms that rely on easier linear algebra problems than those described in @xcite . in the imaginary case ,",
    "this idea is due to vollmer @xcite ; our work represents the first implementation of his method .",
    "our data obtained shows that our algorithms are indeed faster than previous methods .",
    "we use our data to estimate parameter sizes for quadratic field cryptosystems that offer security equivalent to nist s five recommended security levels @xcite .",
    "in the imaginary case , these recommendations update previous results of hamdy and mller @xcite , and in the real case this is the first time such recommendations have been provided .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we briefly recall the required background of ideal arithmetic in quadratic fields , and give an overview of the index - calculus algorithms for solving the two discrete logarithms in section  [ sec : dlp ] .",
    "our numerical results are described in section  [ sec : results ] , followed by the security parameter estimates in section  [ sec : estimates ] .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of arithmetic in quadratic fields . for more details on the theory , algorithms , and cryptographic applications of quadratic fields , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 be the quadratic field of discriminant @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a non - zero integer congruent to @xmath11 or @xmath12 modulo @xmath13 with @xmath10 or @xmath14 square - free .",
    "the integral closure of @xmath15 in @xmath16 , called the maximal order , is denoted by @xmath17 the ideals of @xmath18 are the main objects of interest in terms of cryptographic applications .",
    "an ideal can be represented by the two dimensional @xmath15-module @xmath19\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 the integers @xmath22 and @xmath23 are unique , and @xmath24 is defined modulo @xmath25 the ideal @xmath26 is said to be primitive if @xmath27 the norm of @xmath26 is given by @xmath28    ideals can be multiplied using gauss composition formulas for integral binary quadratic forms .",
    "ideal norm respects this operation .",
    "the prime ideals of @xmath18 have the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a prime that is split or ramified in @xmath31 i.e. , the kronecker symbol @xmath32 as @xmath18 is a dedekind domain , every ideal can be factored uniquely as a product of prime ideals . to factor @xmath33 it suffices to factor @xmath34 and , for each prime @xmath30 dividing the norm , determine whether the prime ideal @xmath35 or @xmath36 divides @xmath26 according to whether @xmath24 is congruent to @xmath37 or @xmath38 modulo @xmath39    two ideals @xmath40 are said to be equivalent , denoted by @xmath41 if there exist @xmath42 such that @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the principal ideal generated by @xmath45 this is in fact an equivalence relation , and the set of equivalence classes forms a finite abelian group called the class group , denoted by @xmath46 its order is called the class number , and is denoted by @xmath47    arithmetic in the class group is performed on reduced ideal representatives of the equivalence classes .",
    "an ideal @xmath26 is reduced if it is primitive and @xmath34 is a minimum in @xmath48 reduced ideals have the property that @xmath49 yielding reasonably small representatives of each group element . the group operation",
    "then consists of multiplying two reduced ideals and computing a reduced ideal equivalent to the product .",
    "this operation is efficient and can be performed in @xmath50 bit operations .    in the case of imaginary quadratic fields , we have @xmath51 and that every element in @xmath52 contains exactly one reduced ideal .",
    "thus , the ideal class group can be used as the basis of most public - key cryptosystems that require arithmetic in a finite abelian group .",
    "the only wrinkle is that computing the class number @xmath53 seems to be as hard as solving the discrete logarithm problem , so only cryptosystems for which the group order is not known can be used .    in real quadratic fields",
    ", the class group tends to be small ; in fact , a conjecture of gauss predicts that @xmath54 infinitely often , and the cohen - lenstra heuristics @xcite predict that this happens about @xmath55 of the time for prime discriminants .",
    "thus , the discrete logarithm problem in the class group is not in general suitable for cryptographic use .",
    "another consequence of small class groups in the real case is that there are no longer unique reduced ideal representatives in each equivalence class .",
    "instead , we have that @xmath56 where the regulator @xmath57 roughly approximates how many reduced ideals are in each equivalence class .",
    "thus , since @xmath53 is frequently small , there are roughly @xmath58 equivalent reduced ideals in each equivalence class .",
    "the infrastructure , namely the set of reduced principal ideals , is used for cryptographic purposes instead of the class group .",
    "although this structure is not a finite abelian group , the analogue of exponentiation ( computing a reduced principal ideal @xmath44 with @xmath59 as close to a given number as possible ) is efficient and can be used as a one - way problem suitable for public - key cryptography .",
    "the inverse of this problem , computing an approximation of the unknown @xmath59 from a reduced principal ideal given in @xmath60-basis representation , is called the principal ideal problem or infrastructure discrete logarithm problem , and is believed to be of similar difficulty to the discrete logarithm problem in the class group of an imaginary quadratic field .",
    "the fastest algorithms in practice for computing discrete logarithms in the class group and infrastructure use the index - calculus framework .",
    "like other index - calculus algorithms , these algorithms rely on finding certain smooth quantities , those whose prime divisors are all small in some sense . in the case of quadratic fields ,",
    "one searches for smooth principal ideals for which all prime ideal divisors have norm less than a given bound @xmath61 the set of prime ideals @xmath62 with @xmath63 is called the factor base , denoted by @xmath64    a principal ideal @xmath65 with @xmath66 that factors completely over the factor base yields the relation @xmath67 in the imaginary case , the @xmath68 coefficients are not required and are ignored .",
    "the key to the index - calculus approach is the fact , proved by buchmann @xcite , that the set of all relations forms a sublattice @xmath69 of determinant @xmath70 as long as the prime ideals in the factor base generate @xmath46 this follows , in part , due to the fact that @xmath71 the integer component of @xmath72 is the kernel of the homomorphism @xmath73 given by @xmath74 for @xmath75 the homomorphism theorem then implies that @xmath76 in the imaginary case , where the @xmath68 terms are omitted , the relation lattice consists only of the integer part , and the corresponding results were proved by hafner and mccurley @xcite .    the main idea behind the algorithms described in @xcite for solving the class group and infrastructure discrete logarithm problems is to find random relations until they generate the entire relation lattice @xmath77 suppose @xmath78 is a matrix whose rows contain the integer coordinates of the relations , and @xmath79 is a vector containing the real parts",
    ". to check whether the relations generate @xmath72 we begin by computing the hermite normal form of @xmath78 and then calculating its determinant , giving us a multiple @xmath80 of the class number @xmath47 we also compute a multiple of the regulator @xmath81 using the analytic class number formula and bach s @xmath82-approximation method @xcite , we construct bounds such that @xmath70 itself is the only integer multiple of the product of the class number and regulator satisfying @xmath83 ; if @xmath84 satisfies these bounds , then @xmath80 and @xmath85 are the correct class number and regulator and the set of relations given in @xmath78 generates @xmath77    a multiple @xmath85 of the regulator @xmath57 can be computed either from a basis of the kernel of the row - space of @xmath78 ( as in @xcite ) or by randomly sampling from the kernel as described by vollmer @xcite .",

    "suppose the factorization is given by @xmath102 then , since @xmath103 is the kernel of @xmath104 if @xmath26 is principal , @xmath79 must be a linear combination of the elements of @xmath105 this can be determined by solving @xmath106 where as before the rows of @xmath78 are the vectors in @xmath105 furthermore , we have @xmath107 is a solution to the infrastructure discrete logarithm problem . the approximation of @xmath59 is computed to guaranteed numerical accuracy using another algorithm of maurer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec  5.5 ) .",
    "if it is necessary to verify the solvability of the problem instance , then one must verify that the relations generate all of @xmath72 for example , as described above .",
    "the best methods for this certification are conditional on the generalized riemann hypothesis , both for their expected running time and their correctness . however , in a cryptographic application , it can safely be assumed that the problem instance does have a solution ( for example , if it comes from the diffie - hellman key exchange protocol ) , and simplifications are possible . in particular , the correctness of the computed solution can be determined without certifying that the relations generate @xmath72 for example , by verifying that @xmath108 as a result , the relatively expensive linear algebra required ( computing hermite normal form and kernel of the row space ) can be replaced by linear system solving .",
    "in the imaginary case , if the discrete logarithm is known to exist , one can use an algorithm due to vollmer @xcite . instead of computing the structure of",
    "@xmath91 one finds ideals equivalent to @xmath100 and @xmath26 that factor over the factor base .",
    "then , combining these factorizations with the rest of the relations and solving a linear system yields a solution of the discrete logarithm problem .",
    "if the linear system can not be solved , then the relations do not generate @xmath72 and the process is simply repeated after generating some additional relations .",
    "the expected asymptotic complexity of this method , under reasonable assumptions about the generation of relations , is @xmath109)$ ] @xcite , where @xmath110 = \\exp\\big(c\\,(\\log n)^e ( \\log \\log n)^{1-e}\\big)\\ ] ] for @xmath111 constants and @xmath112 in practice , all the improvements to relation generation and simplifying the relation matrix described in @xcite can be applied .",
    "when using practical versions for generating relations , such as sieving as described in @xcite , it is conjectured that the algorithm has complexity @xmath113).$ ]    in the real case , we also do not need to compute the hermite normal form , as only a multiple of @xmath57 suffices .",
    "the consequence of not certifying that we have the true regulator is that the solutions obtained for the infrastructure discrete logarithm problem may not be minimal .",
    "however , for cryptographic purposes this is sufficient , as these values can still be used to break the corresponding protocols in the same way that a non - minimal solution to the discrete logarithm problem suffices to break group - based protocols .",
    "thus , we use vollmer s approach @xcite based on randomly sampling from the kernel of @xmath114 this method computes a multiple that is with high probability equal to the regulator in time @xmath115)$ ] by computing the multiple corresponding to random elements in the kernel of the row space of @xmath114 these random elements can also be found by linear system solving .",
    "the resulting algorithm has the same complexity as that in the imaginary case . in practice",
    ", all the improvements described in @xcite can be applied . when these are used , including sieving as described in @xcite , we also conjecture that the algorithm has complexity @xmath113).$ ]",
    "our implementation takes advantage of the latest practical improvements in ideal class group computation and regulator computation for quadratic number fields , described in detail in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we give a brief outline of the methods we used for the experiments described in this paper .",
    "to speed up the relation collection phase , we combined the double large prime variation with the self - initialized quadratic sieve strategy of @xcite , as descried in @xcite .",
    "this results in a considerable speed - up in the time required for finding a relation , at the cost of a growth of the dimensions of the relation matrix .",
    "we also used bernstein s batch smoothness test @xcite to enhance the relation collection phase as described in @xcite , by simultaneously testing residues produced by the sieve for smoothness .",
    "the algorithms involved in the linear algebra phase are highly sensitive to the dimensions of the relation matrix .",
    "as the double large prime variation induces significant growth in the dimensions of the relation matrix , one needs to perform gaussian elimination to reduce the number of columns in order to make the linear algebra phase feasible .",
    "we used a graph - based elimination strategy first described by cavallar @xcite for factorization , and then adapted by biasse @xcite to the context of quadratic fields . at the end of the process",
    ", we test if the resulting matrix @xmath116 has full rank by reducing it modulo a word - sized prime .",
    "if not , we collect more relation and repeat the algorithm .    for solving the discrete logarithm problem in the imaginary case",

    "given two ideals @xmath26 and @xmath100 such that @xmath117 for some integer @xmath98 , we find two extra relations @xmath118 and @xmath119 such that @xmath120 and @xmath121 over the extended factor base @xmath122 .",
    "the extra relations are obtained by multiplying @xmath123 and @xmath100 by random power products of primes in @xmath124 and sieving with the resulting ideal to find an equivalent ideal that is smooth over @xmath64 once these relations have been found , we construct the matrix @xmath125{c.c}{c.c }     \\begin{bmat}(2pt,1cm,1cm){c}{c } a    \\end{bmat } & \\begin{bmat}(2pt,0.5cm,1cm){c}{c } ( 0 )    \\end{bmat } \\\\",

    "the timings , given in seconds , are averages of three different random prime discriminants , obtained with 2.4 ghz opterons with 8 gb or memory .",

    "it is possible to produce more accurate security parameter estimates by taking more factors into account as is done , for example , by lenstra and verheul @xcite , as well as using a more accurate performance measure than mips - year .",
    "however , our results nevertheless provide a good rough guideline on the required discriminant sizes that is likely sufficiently accurate in the inexact science of predicting security levels .",
    "it would also be of interest to conduct a new comparison of the efficiency of rsa as compared to the cryptosystems based on quadratic fields .",
    "due to the differences in the asymptotic complexities of integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problems in quadratic fields , it is clear that there is a point where the cryptosystems based on quadratic fields will be faster than rsa .",
