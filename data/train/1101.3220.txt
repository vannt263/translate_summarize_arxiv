    "( uwb ) transmission systems are widely regarded as a promising technique for short - range applications like wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) @xcite , as the relatively large signaling bandwidth enables a reduced transmit power spectral density , coexistence to established narrow - band systems , and supports a large number of simultaneous users . in particular , impulse - radio uwb ( ir - uwb ) is especially well suited for wsns due to its robustness to severe multi - path fading even in indoor environments , the potential to provide accurate localization , and , last but not least , due to its low cost and complexity @xcite .",
    "moreover , commonly in wsns information is transmitted in relatively short bursts and only low data rates have to be supported , such that intersymbol interference can easily be avoided .",
    "we denote the burst length by @xmath0 .    avoiding costly channel estimation , low - complexity ir - uwb receivers rely on noncoherent detection such as energy detection in the case of pulse - position - modulated ir - uwb , or autocorrelation detection in the case of pulse - amplitude - modulated ir - uwb @xcite , cf . , e.g. , ( differential ) transmitted - reference @xcite .",
    "in particular , an autocorrelation receiver ( acr ) enables conventional symbol - wise differential detection ( dd ) @xcite .",
    "the performance of acr - based dd ( in terms of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) to guarantee a desired bit error rate ( ber ) ) , however , suffers a large gap compared to idealistic detection assuming perfect channel estimation .",
    "this gap can be bridged to a large extend , when jointly deciding for the best sequence of the @xmath0 symbols within the burst based on correlations of the receive signal ranging over the entire burst interval , i.e. , employing an @xmath0-branch acr @xcite . however",
    ", for large burst length , this ideal noncoherent sequence estimation imposes a very high complexity burden , as it a ) requires delaying and correlating the receive signal over the entire burst interval , and b ) exhibits a very high computational complexity to find the optimum sequence ( exponential in @xmath0 ) .",
    "hence , reduced - complexity detection schemes  still achieving close - to - optimum performance  are requested .    in this paper , we focus on detection schemes employing a  still extended , but reduced - complexity@xmath1-branch acr , where @xmath2 .",
    "we first review two well - known techniques , and show how both are connected to ideal noncoherent sequence estimation from the perspective of tree - search decoding @xcite . in particular , we consider block - wise multiple - symbol differential detection ( msdd ) @xcite employing the sphere decoder ( sd ) @xcite in combinations with techniques for complexity reduction , e.g. , @xcite , and detection based on the viterbi algorithm ( va ) @xcite .",
    "the drawback of both methods , despite of their good performance , is that their computational complexity is relatively high and in the worst case increases exponentially with the blocksize or memory length , respectively .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to exploit the well - known relation of decision - feedback detection as an approximation of tree - search decoding @xcite . in doing so , we are able to transfer the concept of decision - feedback differential detection ( df - dd ) @xcite to acr - based detection of ir - uwb , yielding a computational complexity only linear in @xmath1 .",
    "similar approaches have successfully been applied , e.g. , in the area of differential space - time modulation @xcite . as known from multi - antenna systems , the performance of decision - feedback detection",
    "can be improved when decisions are taken in an optimized order @xcite .",
    "a comparison with respect to performance and complexity of the presented schemes allows us to conclude that such sorted variants of df - dd for ir - uwb achieve close - to - optimum performance at very low , and in particular constant receiver complexity , thus realize a very good performance - complexity tradeoff .",
    "noteworthy , besides acr - based detection there are other promising non - autocorrelation - based approaches to ir - uwb detection , such as the related approaches based on a decision - directed acr @xcite and on crosscorrelations with iteratively generated reference templates @xcite , or approaches exploiting the sparsity of the uwb propagation channel via compressed sensing @xcite or rake reception employing a reduced number of fingers @xcite .",

    "[ sec : comparison ] .",
    "we conclude with final remarks in section [ sec : last ] .",
    "throughout this paper , we consider transmission of binary pulse - amplitude - modulated ir - uwb in bursts of @xmath3 information symbols .",
    "the receive signal is then given as @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , are @xmath7 transmit symbols , which represent @xmath3 encoded information symbols @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the symbol duration .",
    "differential encoding is assumed , such that @xmath11 , with the reference symbol @xmath12 , but equivalent encoding rules , e.g. , multiple - symbol transmitted - reference ( mstr ) @xcite , are also possible .",
    "the overall receive pulse shape @xmath13 results from the convolution of transmit pulse , receive filter , and channel impulse response ; its energy is normalized to one , thus , the energy per bit is given by @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is white gaussian noise of two - sided power - spectral density @xmath16 , band - limited by the receive filter . to preclude intersymbol interference ,",
    "the symbol duration @xmath10 is chosen sufficiently large , such that each pulse has decayed before the next pulse is received .    note that the problem of timing acquisition and the usually applied frame structure used for time - hopping and code - division multiple access @xcite are not explicitly taken into account , as the latter can be regarded as additional linear block coding , or averaged out prior to further receive signal processing , cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the core - ingredient of all investigated schemes for ir - uwb signal detection is the analog ( or sufficiently sampled ) front - end depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : acr ] , the so - called @xmath1-branch acr . for the @xmath17-th symbol interval",

    "the integration interval @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) of the acr is a receiver parameter , which can be adapted to the channel characteristics at hand ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .    demanding the channel to remain constant over an interval of @xmath22-symbols , an @xmath1-branch acr provides information on the relation of the current symbol to the preceeding @xmath1 symbols . the phase transition from @xmath23 to @xmath24",
    "is superposed by an `` information @xmath25 noise '' and `` noise @xmath25 noise '' term , i.e. , @xmath26 where @xmath27 collects all terms corrupted by noise .",
    "difficulties in hardware implementation of the acr may be regarded as a question of technology .",
    "in particular the realization of accurate analog delay lines remains a demanding task , cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite , but advances in speed of a / d converters @xcite will soon solve this problem .",
    "in the case of a single - branch acr ( @xmath28 ) , using @xmath29 , from ( [ eq : acroutput_detail ] ) it can be seen that symbol - wise dd is performed , such that the information symbols are directly obtained as @xmath30 . in the case of an extended acr ( @xmath31 )",
    ", there are various methods how to finally decide the transmit symbols based on the acr output ; these are described in the following . beginning with ideal noncoherent sequence estimation ( inse ) , we discuss approximations thereof based on msdd and the va . from this",
    "detailed , but unified treatment , we are not only able to straightforwardly derive novel df - dd schemes for ir - uwb detection under [ sec : dfdd ] , exploiting relations well - known from tree - search decoding @xcite , but also to conduct a comprehensive comparison with respect to performance and complexity in sec .  [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "this summarizes , along with novel insights in techniques for complexity reduction of the sd for msdd , the main contribution of the paper .",
    "first , recall that ideal noncoherent sequence estimation ( inse ) would jointly decide for the best sequence of @xmath7 symbols , taking into account the receive signal in the entire burst interval @xmath32 .",
    "as the statistics of the receive pulse shape @xmath13 are unknown , according to generalized - likelihood ratio testing ( glrt ) an explicit optimization over this unknown parameter is included @xcite .",
    "collecting the transmit symbols in a vector , this results in solving @xcite @xmath33 where the statistics @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , are obtained from an @xmath3-branch acr .",
    "it is evident that , for large @xmath3 , this is infeasible for two reasons : a ) correlations of the receive signal over time delays of @xmath37 have to be performed , which requires accurate delay lines over possibly hundreds of symbols , making hardware implementation impossible , and b ) the computational complexity of finding the best sequence is exponential in @xmath0 , and thus intractable , since  at least at worst case  any algorithm must perform an exhaustive search over all @xmath38 possible sequences .",
    "hence , methods which are based on an acr with only @xmath39 branches and reduced computational complexity  at best linear in @xmath1are called for . to motivate these techniques , note that inse for binary signaling can be viewed as a tree search problem in a binary tree of depth @xmath0 , with the optimum sequence given by the path from the root to the leaf with maximum path metric",
    ".      one possible approximation of the inse search problem is to split the binary tree of depth @xmath0 into smaller subtrees of depth @xmath1 and to solve each one independent .",
    "this corresponds to splitting the burst of @xmath3 symbols into smaller blocks of @xmath1 symbols , and perform block - wise msdd , based on the receive signal only in the corresponding interval . to this end , the burst of @xmath7 receive symbols is decomposed into @xmath40 blocks of @xmath22 symbols @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 , each representing @xmath1 information symbols , which , due to the differential encoding , overlap by one symbol . ] .",
    "the decision metric of block - wise msdd is directly obtained from the inse decision metric when restricting it to the corresponding block intervals . however , to facilitate the application of tree - search decoding algorithms , a constant is subtracted similar to @xcite , yielding , with @xmath43 , exemplarily for the first block , @xmath44 the required statistics to solve ( [ eq : msdd ] ) , @xmath34 , can be obtained from an acr with only @xmath1 @xmath45 branches .    due to the reformulation , the @xmath17-th increment of the decision metric , @xmath46 is always non - negative and solely depends on the @xmath17 preceeding symbols @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "this allows to check the decision metric componentwise , and thus fits into the framework of general tree - search decoding and in particular enables the application of the sd @xcite .",
    "note there are further options to approximately solve ( [ eq : msdd ] ) efficiently , e.g. , based on relaxations of the search problemthese approaches are not considered in the latter comparison , as they require operations of significantly higher complexity compared to the presented schemes , such as solving a semi - definite program in @xcite or calculating dominant eigenvectors in @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite .",
    "clearly , for @xmath49 , inse is obtained ; for the case of @xmath28 , i.e. , the decision of a single information symbol , block - wise msdd reduces to traditional dd . in @xcite",
    "it has been observed that using blocks overlapping by more than one symbol , so - called subset msdd , yields further gains in performance at the cost of complexity . due to lack of space this",

    "we briefly review sd - based msdd rather than on the data symbols @xmath50 , yielding certain benefits as described below . ] : employing the schnorr - euchner search strategy , at some node at depth @xmath51 the sd chooses the branch labeled by @xmath52 with minimum branch metric . as the sd operates on the transmit symbols , using ( [ eq : optnse ] ) and ( [ eq : msdd : branchm ] ) ,",

    "it has been shown that choosing the stopping radius as @xmath85 preserves the optimality of the sd output .      instead of choosing the initial sd search radius arbitrarily large ( cf . ,",

    "this can , e.g. , be the decision metric of the dd sequence . in this case , if the sd does not find a better sequence , @xmath86 .",
    "if already the metric of the dd sequence meets the above stopping criterion , a sd call is not necessary at all .",
    "another technique to approximate inse , suggested in @xcite , employs the viterbi algorithm ( va ) .",

    ", the memory length is truncated to a maximum of @xmath1 .",
    "again taking the view that inse is a search in a binary tree of depth @xmath0 , this results in nodes , which may be assumed to be equivalent starting from a depth greater than @xmath1 . merging these nodes , a trellis structure with a total of @xmath88 states",
    "is obtained .",
    "this procedure is in the spirit of delayed decision - feedback sequence estimation @xcite .",
    "the path metric for the va is obtained from the inse metric ( [ eq : optnse ] ) by restricting the memory length to @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath89 as usual for the va , the final estimate is the sequence with maximum path metric .",
    "the va ensures a fixed complexity ( exponential in @xmath1 , but linear in @xmath3 ) .",
    "again , an @xmath1-branch acr is sufficient .",
    "depending on @xmath1 , the va will tradeoff between dd ( @xmath28 ) and inse ( @xmath49 ) ; thus , for @xmath49 , msdd and the va are equivalent .",
    "the va , as well as block - wise msdd in the worst case , have a complexity in the order of @xmath88 , i.e. , exponential in the memory length or blocksize , respectively .",
    "it is desireable to have a complexity linear in @xmath1 .",
    "this can be achieved using the principle of decision - feedback differential detection ( df - dd ) @xcite .",
    "there are essentially two variants of df - dd for ir - uwb , both operating on the output of an @xmath1-branch acr : block - wise df - dd being closely related to block - wise msdd , and continuous df - dd being related to the va implementation .",
    "block - wise df - dd is directly obtained from sd - based block - wise msdd @xcite .",
    "the schnorr - euchner search strategy in the sd for msdd ensures that the first estimate in the sd search process equals df - dd .",
    "thus , terminating the sd after the first point found , results in df - dd with a linearly increasing feedback window length ( from @xmath87 to @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is achieved , e.g. , by calling the sd with @xmath90 , or , equivalently , choosing @xmath91 , and , similar to ( [ eq : msdd : schnorreuchner ] ) , @xmath92    it is well known  especially from df equalization in multi - antenna systems , also known as blast @xcite  that taking the decisions in an optimized order , i.e. , employing some sorting , improves the performance . similarly , in the context of ir - uwb , interchanging the decision order within a block is enabled through the block - wise processing of bdf - dd ( then labeled sorted block - wise df - dd ( sbdf - dd ) ) . interchanging the decision order",
    "can easily be achieved by reordering the columns and rows of @xmath93 acc .  to some sequence @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "a reasonable sorting criterion can be derived from the df - dd process itself . for reliable decisions in each step the magnitude of the argument of the @xmath98-function in ( [ eq : dfdd : block ] ) is desired to be as large as possible . hence , with @xmath99 , @xmath100 , the first decided symbol should be the @xmath101-th symbol , where @xmath102 . taking the previous decision into account , the symbol which can be decided most reliable next",
    "can be found successively from @xmath103 and its value reads @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",

    "it has to be noted that in contrast to blast , sorting is done per block based on the actual receive symbols and taking the previous decisions into account , rather than on the channel realization .",
    "noteworthy , the special case of sorted block - wise df - dd and @xmath61 is equivalent to msdd , i.e. , @xmath109 . to proof",
    "this , assume @xmath93 is sorted , thus @xmath110 holds ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : msdd : zmat ] ) ) .",

    "in any case the minimum possible msdd metric @xmath119 results .    a similar sorting step may also be used as a preprocessing step in the case of msdd using the sd , however as no previous decisions are available , ( [ eq : dfdd : sort ] ) is upper bounded using the triangular inequality . note that sorting is only possible as the sd operates on the transmit symbols . since the sd starts with the df - dd sequence , using a sorted sd input  and correspondingly reordering the output  delivers an improved first preliminary sequence and correspondingly updated search radius , thus speeds up the sd search process .",
    "note that sorting of the sd input  among different preprocessing steps  is a well known technique for sd complexity reduction @xcite .",
    "another variant of df - dd with a symbol - wise processing ( sliding window ) can be derived from the va making use of the relation of the va and df - dd , which has been established in @xcite ; in this view df - dd corresponds to a reduced - state sequence estimation with only a single state . for cdf - dd of ir - uwb , in contrast to ( [ eq : dfdd : block ] )",

    "in this section , we compare the presented ir - uwb detection schemes in terms of performance and complexity .",
    "we first define the complexity measure adopted in this paper and then assess the performance - complexity tradeoff via numerical results .",
    "since all schemes ( apart from inse , which only serves as a reference ) are based on the output of the same @xmath1-branch acr , we focus on the computational complexity of the decision unit .",
    "due to binary signaling , all multiplications ( e.g. , in ( [ eq : msdd ] ) ) are limited to sign - inversions , thus , assuming a suitable number format , such that sign - inversion and the @xmath122- and @xmath123-operation require negligible complexity ( e.g. , two s complement ) , the main source of computational complexity of sd - based msdd , the va , or variants of df - dd is the number of real - valued additions ( adds ) .    due to the triangular structure ,",

    "the va performs @xmath126 adds per state , thus , in total @xmath127 adds per processed information symbol , yielding a complexity exponential in @xmath1 .",
    "concerning sd - based msdd , the number of real - valued adds of the sd search process depends on the realization of @xmath93 and in particular on the snr .",

    "the same number of adds is required to find an initial search radius for the sd based on the msdd decision metric of a particular sequence . in the case of sorted df - dd , sorting does not add to the overall complexity , as sorting is done successively based on a similar expression as required for taken the decisions ( arguments of ( [ eq : dfdd : sort ] ) and ( [ eq : dfdd : sortdec ] ) are equal ) .",
    "however , if sorting is applied as a preprocessing step of the sd for msdd , calculating the optimized order increases the complexity by @xmath131 adds per block of @xmath1 symbols .    with the argumentation above , the complexity of dd , of finding the stopping criterion ( [ eq : msdd : rstop ] ) , and of the final differential decoding step to obtain the information symbols from the estimated transmit symbols may be neglected .      for all numerical simulations ,",
    "a typical ir - uwb scenario has been considered : the transmit pulse shape is chosen as a gaussian monocycle with @xmath132 center frequency and a bandwidth of @xmath133 ( measured at @xmath134 ) , the propagation channel is modeled acc .  to ieee - cm2 @xcite",

    "inse results in gains of about @xmath139 over traditional dd for @xmath140 . even for the relatively large feedback length of @xmath141 , df - dd ( block - wise and continuous processing",

    "for reference , due to the high complexity its performance is approximated by ( sorted ) df - dd with @xmath144 .",
    "naturally , the presented reduced - complexity detection schemes , employing only an @xmath145-branch acr , i.e. , block - wise msdd , va - based detection , and the df - dd schemes , show increasing loss compared to inse for decreasing @xmath1 . while block - wise msdd ( again all variants  sorted / non - sorted ,",
