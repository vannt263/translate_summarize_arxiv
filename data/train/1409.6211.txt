    "[ fig-1 ] we present the densities of the ground state of @xmath208 @xmath1rb atoms with different so coupling and without the rabi term . without the so coupling ,",
    "the ground state solution for @xmath1rb is miscible and @xmath209 for zero magnetization ( @xmath210 ) [ viz .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) ] , which is in qualitative agreement with the conclusion of the analytic study of the uniform system in sec .",
    "[ sec - iii ] given by eq .",
    "( [ den_mis_ferro ] ) .",
    "if the number of atoms is sufficiently large , as the the so coupling @xmath10 is increased , the density @xmath211 starts decreasing slowly , which ultimately makes the system immiscible as is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) - ( d ) . for a sufficiently strong so coupling",
    ", @xmath211 becomes zero and there is a maximum of phase separation between the two remaining component densities @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "this is again in agreement with the result of the analytic study on the uniform system given by eq .",
    "( [ den_imis_ferro ] ) , which predicts zero density for the @xmath40th component . however , if the number of atoms is smaller ( @xmath214 ) , the @xmath40th component again vanishes with the increase in so coupling @xmath10 above a critical value , but there is no phase separation between components @xmath0 and @xmath89 .",
    "the state with @xmath215 appears naturally with the increase of the so coupling , and this in a zero magnetization case guarantees an equal number of atoms for the components @xmath0 and @xmath89 resulting in @xmath216 .",
    "it is interesting to study the fate of this state as the magnetization is increased ( @xmath217 ) . keeping @xmath218 and @xmath219 fixed , one can change the relative proportion of @xmath220 and @xmath221 by changing the magnetization @xmath222 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ( a ) - ( d ) , maintaining @xmath223 . with increasing @xmath222",
    "the relative density of component @xmath89 decreases and the system turns miscible from immiscible .",
    "we have also studied the effect of an increase in the the rabi term @xmath28 on the state with @xmath215 [ viz .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ( d ) ] maintaining magnetization @xmath159 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - iii ] , the rabi term @xmath28 favors miscibility of the system irrespective of the nature of the spin dependent interactions , while the so - coupling term @xmath10 favors a phase separation .",
    "hence , when both @xmath10 and @xmath28 are non zero , there is a competition between these two terms as one favors phase separation , whereas the other favors miscibility . to illustrate this , in figs .",
    "[ fig-3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) we plot the component densities for @xmath224 and @xmath0 , respectively , for @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "the increase in the rabi term @xmath28 from @xmath227 to @xmath0 has transformed a phase - separated state to a miscible state . for smaller number of atoms ,",
    "say @xmath228 , we do not observe any phase separation with the increase in the so coupling @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless , the increase in @xmath10 leads to a decrease in @xmath211 as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-3](c ) , where @xmath211 is negligible in comparison to overlapping @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "again as @xmath28 is increased in this case , the density @xmath211 first increases and ultimately ends up being larger than those of other two components [ viz .",
    "[ fig-3](d ) ] .    in the case of the so - coupled polar bec @xmath2na ,",
    "we do not observe any phase separation consistent with the discussion of the uniform bec in sec .",
    "[ sec - iii ] . in the absence of the rabi term ( @xmath219 ) , the density profile in the presence and absence of the so coupling are the same as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] ( a ) .",
    "the introduction of the rabi term leads to a non - zero density of the @xmath40th component as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] ( b ) for @xmath229 .",
    "for both the ferromagnetic and polar becs , in the presence of both so coupling and rabi terms , we observe a formation of structure in the ground state , where the @xmath40th component develops a train of dark notches as shown in fig . [ fig-3](c ) for @xmath1rb and figs . [",
    "fig-4](b ) and ( c ) for @xmath2na . in @xmath2na ,",
    "an increase in the rabi term @xmath28 leads to an increase in @xmath230 from 0 , at the cost of @xmath212 and @xmath213 as in the case of @xmath1rb , and ultimately , ends up with a solution where @xmath231 .",
    "we have studied the so - coupled @xmath3 spinor becs of @xmath1rb ( ferromagnetic ) and @xmath2na ( antiferromagnetic or polar ) atoms in quasi-1d traps . by comparing the energy of various competing structures for the so - coupled spinor bec in a 1d box , we have shown that any non - zero value of the so coupling will lead to a phase separation between the @xmath232 and @xmath233 components in the case of a ferromagnetic bec in the absence of the rabi term .",
    "on the other hand , for a polar bec , so coupling makes the miscible profile energetically more stable as compared to various possible phase - separated profiles . in the case of the trapped so - coupled becs",
    ", we have numerically studied the ground state structures . in the ferromagnetic case , above a critical number of atoms",
    "the bec phase separates if the so coupling strength exceeds a critical value in the absence of the rabi term .",
    "the introduction of the rabi term favors the miscibility for both the ferromagnetic and polar becs .",
    "the present conclusions can be tested in experiments with present - day technology .",
