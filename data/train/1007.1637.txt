    "the primary ellipsoidal valence and conduction bands in the ground state of pbte consist of four valleys contributing to a substantially high seebeck coefficient which makes it an outstanding thermoelectric material for fundamental investigations and for power generation in the temperature regime 600 - 800 k.@xcite recently , compelling improvements of the thermoelectric figure of merit have been demonstrated through strong reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity achieved from nano - structuring of the pbte matrix.@xcite the thermodynamically driven formation of nanostructure rich in ag - sb , na - sb , ag - sn - sb , and s that are embedded endotaxially in the pbte matrix have shown reduced lattice thermal conductivity while at the same time not substantially degrading the beneficial electrical properties of pure pbte.@xcite the figure of merit is expressed through the dimensionless quantity @xmath1 , s being the seebeck coefficient , @xmath2 the electrical conductivity and @xmath3 the total thermal conductivity comprising contributions of the lattice phonons and charge carriers .",
    "the transport parameters entering the figure of merit strongly depend on temperature and different materials are considered for different temperature regimes.@xcite    the maximum thermoelectric figure of merit , @xmath4 , that can be attained at a given temperature t , depends on a quite diverse set of materials parameters according to eq .",
    "[ eq:1]:@xcite    @xmath5    in the above , @xmath6 is the thermal conductivity of the lattice , @xmath7 is the effective mass in the i - th direction in the crystal , @xmath8 is the relaxation time of the carriers moving in the direction of the current flow ( assumed to be @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 is the degeneracy of the band extrema near the fermi energy .",
    "it follows that for an isotropic system , high @xmath10 and low @xmath6 values contribute significantly to high figure of merit .    from a practical point of view the lattice thermal conductivity , @xmath6 , of pbte via nanostructuring and alloying",
    "is reaching its low limit .",
    "therefore , further improvements in the zt of pbte can be sought through large enhancements of the efficiency of charge transport quantified by the product s@xmath11 , also known as the power factor .",
    "one approach to enhancing the power factor in pbte has been described by martin et al @xcite who have studied p - type pbte nanocomposites and found that grain boundary scattering dominates charge transport acting as an energy filtering effect that enhances thermopower .",
    "furthermore , faleev and lonard @xcite have suggested enhancements in the power factor in the presence of metallic nanoinclusions .",
    "again , an energy filtering effect is invoked due to band bending at the semiconductor - metal interface that considerably modifies the electronic scattering time .",
    "recently , heremans et al @xcite have investigated distortions in the density of states ( dos ) of tl - doped pbte that can enhance the seebeck coefficient , and hence the power factor , leading to increased figure of merit.@xcite such distortions in the dos are known as resonant states that induce fermi level pinning and have been observed in a number of narrow band gap chalcogenide semiconductors such as gete and snte.@xcite the issue of the distortions in dos and the presence of resonance states is still an open question and it has been recently discussed in detail in the theoretical work of singh.@xcite    in general , dopants in narrow band gap semiconductors do not form mid - gap states.@xcite rather , impurity states outside the energy gap , also known as deep defect states , are formed and interact strongly with the lattice in a way that considerable distortions , not always resonant - like , in the shape and energy distribution of the dos can develop.@xcite in order for resonant states to benefit the thermoelectric properties they should have a sharp distribution in energy , @xmath12 , and preferably be located in energy span within 0.5ev from the fermi level in order to be accessible by usual thermoelectric transport processes.@xcite since there is no experimental way to predict _ a priori _ the formation and behavior of resonating states in pbte , it is evident that the selection of appropriate chemical substitutions for either pb or te could benefit from theoretical calculations .    following the theoretical work of ahmad et al @xcite which predicts a resonant - like dos distortion in p - type pb@xmath13a@xmath14te , ( where a = k , rb , cs , but not na ) we investigated doped pbte giving particular emphasis on k , since our data suggest that the larger rb and cs ions appear to not substitute effectively for pb .",
    "furthermore , following the relevant theory on resonance scattering we doped pbte concurrently with k and na , the former intended as a possible resonance state and the latter , being an electrically active dopant that yields no impurity states , to tune the fermi energy and to check for fermi level pinning.@xcite we have also studied control samples without k and containing na only as a dopant .",
    "although , our experimental results can not support the presence of resonant scattering in our samples , we did observe enhancements in the power factor of the specimens at high temperature .",
    "we discuss our findings with respect to the high temperature electronic band structure of pbte that takes into account the coexistence of two valence bands , a light- and a heavy - hole band , and the interaction between them which can be tuned by the presence of k in the lattice .",
    "the interplay between the two types of valence bands can be tuned with k - na codoping to create a sharply changing dos near the fermi energy in a fashion similar to a resonant state . in this paper",
    "we combine , x - ray diffraction with high temperature hall - effect , electrical conductivity , thermopower , and thermal conductivity measurements to show that codoping of pbte with k and na is an efficient way to control the energy separation between the maxima of the valence bands in order to achieve an effective fermi level pinning , at a given temperature , with respect to the carrier concentration .",
    "we show that , in effect , this creates a resonant - like modification in the dos which can be tuned by the k ions although these ions by themselves do not form a resonant level .",
    "a maximum @xmath151.3 at 700 k was observed as a result of increased power factor rather than reduced thermal conductivity .",

    "the maximum value measured reaches 1.3 at 700 k and this enhancement over conventional na doped pbte ( zt@xmath200.9 ) is primarily associated with the enhanced power factors discussed above .",
    "the seebeck and hall effect data of k , na and k - na doped pbte do not support the development of resonant levels in the electronic band structure of pbte but , rather , point to the importance of the heavy - hole valence band .",
    "nevertheless , an enhancement in the thermoelectric properties similar in nature to what might be expected from resonance levels is observed and is attributed to the behavior of the heavy - hole valence band which responds to the lattice expansion with k doping and can be controlled to a significant degree by adjusting the fermi energy with na doping .",
    "effectively , this causes the heavy - hole valence band to rise in energy and and adjust the fermi energy and create a significant enhancement in the dos that gives rise to interband scattering .",
    "this mimics the influence of a resonance level and has positive effects on the thermoelectric power factor .    as a result , zt @xmath20 1.3",
    "is reached around 700k purely on account of the enhancement in the electronic properties and without a marked reduction in thermal conductivity .",
