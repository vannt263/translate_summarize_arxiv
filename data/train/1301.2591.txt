    "recent observations of m51 , a face - on grand - design spiral previously mapped with optical polarimetry @xcite , failed to detect @xmath0 band polarization , to quite low levels @xcite .",
    "infrared polarimetry of active galaxies , such as m82 @xcite and others @xcite , have revealed complicated , multi - origin polarization components , but the degree to which these objects inform our understanding of the magnetic fields in more normal galaxies like the milky way is unclear .",
    "a new small area , deep @xmath0 band polarization survey of a portion of the taurus molecular cloud complex ( distinct from the study of @xcite ) was undertaken to examine relationships between magnetic fields and turbulence @xcite .",
    "serendipitously , one resolved disk galaxy was apparent in the observations .",
    "the galaxy proved bright enough to measure near - infrared ( nir ) polarization across almost its full extent . given how very few galaxy observations in the nir meet those conditions ,",
    "a more detailed analysis was warranted .",
    "however , because this galaxy ( 2masx  j04412715 + 243311 , designated hereafter as the ` t - galaxy ' for its location in taurus ) , is viewed through the gas , dust , and magnetic fields associated with the taurus molecular cloud complex @xcite , it was necessary to calibrate and remove the foreground galactic effects on the polarization and photometric observations .",
    "this was challenging because the expected t - galaxy @xmath0 band polarization and the foreground taurus polarization were likely to have similar percentage values .",
    "described in the following sections are the new @xmath0 band polarization observations , the data reduction , the general properties determined for the t - galaxy from the @xmath0 band photometry , the determination of the taurus region foreground polarization and extinction , the correction to the t - galaxy polarization observations , and analysis of the nature of the magnetic field present in the t - galaxy and how its field relates to those in other normal galaxies .",
    "ground - based near - infrared @xmath0 band ( 1.6  @xmath1 m ) imaging polarimetry observations were conducted on the night of 2011 october 13 ( ut ) using the mimir instrument @xcite on the 1.83 m perkins telescope , located outside flagstaff , az .",
    "the observations consisted of four sets of 96 images , each of 10  s exposure time .",
    "each set consisted of six sky dither positions , distributed about a hex - pattern of diameter 15 arcsec , with sixteen images at each dither position .",
    "those sixteen images were obtained through sixteen distinct rotation angles of the cold , compound half - wave - plate ( hwp ) to modulate the incoming linear polarization stellar signals and were analyzed by a cold , fixed wire grid prior to detection by the @xmath6 pixel insb aladdin iii array .",
    "they provided a four - fold redundancy for calculating the four independent polarization position angles ( ippas : 0 , 45 , 90 , 135 ) used to form the total intensity normalized linear polarization stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 percentages .",
    "the pixel size was 0.58 arcsec and the full image size was @xmath9 arcmin .",
    "the details of the data collection methodology follow closely those employed for gpips , as described in @xcite .",
    "reduction of the mimir data also followed the gpips pipeline approach @xcite , which included detector non - linearity correction , hwp angle - specific flat - fielding , and dark current corrections as well as corrections for sky transmission variations and instrumental polarization .",
    "the images were background - corrected in two ways . for analysis of the stars in the field , development of ` super - sky ' corrections were used to model and remove the background from the images , as is normally done for gpips data . for analysis of the t - galaxy , the same images had background zones free of emission identified and those pixels were used in a second order fit to model and remove the background near the t - galaxy .",
    "this avoids inadvertent removal of faint , extended emission from the t - galaxy that super - sky use might cause , given the small dither offsets used .",
    "all of the images were combined to yield a stokes @xmath10 ( total intensity ) image , shown in figure  [ fig_deep_image ] .",
    "the t - galaxy appears in the top middle of the figure .",
    "the stars have fwhm values of @xmath11  pixels , or 1.75 arcsec .",
    "gpips stellar polarization values are normally calculated from point spread function ( psf ) cleaned aperture photometry of the stars found in the 16 hwp images for each field , after registering and averaging the corresponding hwp images from all dithered observations .",
    "stars in the t - galaxy field were analyzed for their polarization properties using the normal gpips stellar processing , which yielded a catalog of polarizations , positions , and @xmath12 photometry for the stars that matched to 2mass @xcite ones .",
    "a total of 239 stars had polarization measurements completed , though less than 10% of those were significantly detected in polarization .",
    "this low @xmath13 detection rate is due to the low numbers of stellar photons counted for the fainter stars and the background levels present in the @xmath0 band .",

    "the 200 + polarization non - detection stars are still useful , as their stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 percentages are gaussian distributed , and may be averaged , with weighting , to yield significant polarimetric information , as described in section 4.1 , below .    to polarimetrically analyze the resolved t - galaxy data ,",
    "the hwp images were instead averaged into four ippa images and combined to produce stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 percentage and uncertainty images .",
    "these were corrected for the mimir instrumental polarization @xcite , before uncertainty - weighted smoothing with a 1.75 arcsec fwhm gaussian ( matching the seeing ) .",

    "the color legend in the panel indicates the range of excess surface brightness in the @xmath0 band , above the background of 14.2 mag arcsec@xmath19 , spanning 19.6 to 15.2 mag arcsec@xmath19 in a logarithmic fashion .",
    "the polarization percentage uncertainty @xmath20 image ( figure  [ fig_zoom].c ) shares the same shape characteristics as the stokes @xmath10 image , indicating that poisson noise dominates the photometric , and thereby polarimetric , uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath20 rendering is clipped at an upper value of 4% , and used as the basis to generate an image mask that is applied to the @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_zoom].b ) and p.a .",
    "[ fig_zoom].d ) images .",
    "these images are displayed as colored contours only between the limits indicated in the color legends shown at lower right in each panel .",
    "the @xmath16 panel ( figure  [ fig_zoom].b ) shows polarization detection across almost the full extent of the galaxy , with lower values in two zones offset from the center and higher values ( albeit more uncertain ) toward the galaxy edges .",
    "panel ( figure  [ fig_zoom].d ) displays the polarization p.a.s , which have been modified to resolve aliasing about 180 , so as to track behavior of the pixels across the histogram of p.a.s ( not shown ) more smoothly .",
    "this results in apparent p.a .",
    "values spanning a range of 30 to 210 , as indicated in the color legend in that panel .",
    "values seem to favor polarization orientations of about 130 to the northeast ( ne ) of the photometric center and closer to 188 to the southwest ( sw ) .",
    "the former is close to the elongation direction of the major axis ( 142 , see below ) .",
    "neither is along the direction favored by the polarization orientations of the stars in the field ( figure  [ fig_deep_image ] ) .",
    "thus , although correction for the taurus foreground polarization contribution will be important to generating images of @xmath13 and p.a .",
    "intrinsic to the t - galaxy , the apparent detections presented in figure  [ fig_zoom ] were not produced _ by _ the foreground polarization .",
    "nir spectroscopy observations were obtained toward the @xmath21 mag core of the t - galaxy , using mimir and the perkins on the night of 2012 september 25 .",
    "the spectral range covered the full h and k bands ( 1.4 - 2.5@xmath1 m ) at a resolution of about 500 , using a 1.2 arcsec wide by 5 arcmin tall slit .",
    "eight spectral images with 5 min exposure time were dithered along the slit .",
    "wavelength calibration used an argon lamp .",
    "correction for telluric absorption was done using observation of k tau ( a bright a0v star ) through nearly the same airmass and sky direction .",
    "all spectra were wavelength - calibrated , using the 2d dispersion function obtained from the argon images , and registered before adding ( with outlier rejection ) .",
    "the k tau spectrum was fit and modeled to remove its hydrogen absorption lines in order to develop a telluric transmission spectrum , using the xtellcor routine in the spextool package @xcite .",
    "this was wavelength matched and divided into the summed t - galaxy spectrum .",
    "the resulting atmosphere - corrected spectrum for the t - galaxy is shown as figure  [ fig_hk_spec ] .",
    "it presents a mostly thermal , cool stellar population appearance , peaking at about 1.65  @xmath1 m .",
    "there are no strong emission or absorption lines seen , to a limit of 5% of the continuum .",
    "this includes a lack of br  @xmath22 ( 2.166  @xmath1 m ) , either at zero velocity or at the redshift indicated for the t - galaxy ( see below ) .",
    "this galaxy was first studied by @xcite , who used the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as input to the 2mass redshift survey ( 2mrs : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to search for groups of galaxies containing at least three members .",
    "the t - galaxy was listed as the second rank member of the five - galaxy group designated number 308 by @xcite , whose measured radial velocity of 3868 km  s@xmath23 places the t - galaxy at a distance of 52.7 mpc ( z @xmath24 0.013 for @xmath0 = 73 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 ) .",
    "its nearest group neighbor is located some 11 arcmin ( 170 kpc ) away in sky projection , so they are unlikely to be interacting .",
    "the t - galaxy stokes @xmath10 image ( figure  [ fig_zoom].a ) exhibits a circular radius encompassing 90% of the petrosian flux @xcite of 11.75 pixels , or 1.75 kpc at 53 mpc . the similarly computed 50% radius lead to a petrosian concentration index of 2.9 .",
    "this 50% petrosian radius is about twice the fwhm seeing , so the concentration index should be unaffected .",
    "this image of the t - galaxy was fit with a combination @xcite disk model and an exponential bulge model using the mpfit package @xcite .",
    "the galaxy disk was assumed to be circular when viewed face - on to allow deprojecting the fundamental disk and bulge parameters simultaneously .",
    "the deprojected bulge was allowed to be elliptical with its own eccentricity and orientation .",
    "the line - of - sight inclination angle was found to be 73.7@xmath40.1 ( i.e. , close to edge - on ) , deprojected along p.a .",
    "141.6@xmath40.1 , measured east from north .",
    "the independent fits to the bulge and disk allowed calculation of the bulge - to - total ( b / t ) flux ratio , found to be 0.24@xmath40.04 .",
    "this is a brighter bulge than for the milky way , whose b / t ratio is in the range 0.110.13 @xcite .",
    "the t - galaxy disk scale length was found to be 11.3@xmath40.3 pixels ( 1.7 kpc ) and the bulge scale length was 0.89@xmath40.03 pixels ( 130 pc ) . milky way disk scale lengths are larger , with estimates ranging from 2.26  kpc @xcite to 3.3  kpc @xcite .",
    "the t - galaxy bulge orientation was 142.6@xmath45.6 ( well - aligned with its disk ) and the bulge inclination was 60.9@xmath43.7 .",
    "the radial profile shows a small excess around a deprojected radius of 4 arcsec ( 1 kpc ) , which could indicate the presence of luminous spiral arms in the disk and confirm the spiral galaxy designation .",
    "the @xmath0 band magnitude integrated out to the petrosian radius is 11.35 , yielding an absolute magnitude in this band of @xmath25 prior to any extinction correction ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the radius , concentration index , b / t ratio , and absolute magnitude are all consistent with the t - galaxy being a mid - type spiral .",
    "the hk spectroscopy confirms that the bulge does not appear to harbor a significant active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .    in all of these aspects ,",
    "the t - galaxy would seem to be a milky way analog , though smaller , of somewhat lower mass , and with a brighter bulge .",
    "because the t - galaxy is viewed through the nearby ( d = 147.6@xmath40.6 pc : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) taurus molecular cloud complex , which is known to exhibit both significant extinction , in the form of dark clouds and intercloud material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and magnetic fields , as previously traced through optical @xcite and nir starlight polarimetry @xcite , the effects of this foreground material had to be quantified and removed to obtain the intrinsic t - galaxy properties . for the foreground polarization , analysis of the mimir polarimetry of the stars in the field containing the t - galaxy was performed and evaluated . for the photometric extinction and contributed reddening , analysis of stellar photometry in a somewhat larger field centered on the t - galaxy",
    "was performed , using several available data sets .      within the @xmath9 arcmin mimir field ,",
    "239 stars were sufficiently bright for polarimetric evaluation ( i.e. , were detected in each of the four ippas of the hwp ) .",
    "of these , twelve showed good polarization signal - to - noise ( @xmath26 ) and 227 stars showed lower signal - to - noise . by separating the stars into two stellar samples based on their s / n ratios",
    ", the effects of distance on the foreground polarization contribution could be examined .",
    "this analysis followed that described in @xcite , where stellar sample mean magnitude ( which relates to s / n for poisson - limited polarimetry ) was shown to be a useful proxy for distance .",
    "the stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 percentages for each of these two samples were separately averaged , using inverse variance weighting .",
    "the same stokes uncertainty variance weighting was applied to the @xmath0 band magnitudes for each stellar sample , resulting in a weighted mean of 10.7 mag for the 12 star sample and 13.6 for the remainder sample .",
    "if both samples contain the same types of stars , the remainder sample would be on average about four times more distant than the 12 star sample .",
    "a high fraction of the stars in both samples are expected to be giants , and to be located kiloparsecs beyond @xcite the much nearer taurus molecular cloud complex .",
    "there should be relatively few stars foreground to taurus in the mimir field , and any present would likely show little to no @xmath0 band polarization .",
    "the stokes @xmath8 and @xmath7 percentage means for the two samples were found to agree to within 1.5 times their propagated uncertainties .",
    "thus , a significant change in polarization across the distances probed using the stars in the field was not found .",
    "the two sets were therefore combined and weighted means were computed for the stokes percentage parameters .",
    "the weighted mean percentage values found across all 239 stars were : @xmath27 where the subscript ` fg ' identifies the foreground contribution and @xmath28 has been ricean - corrected to debias for the polarimetric uncertainty , following @xcite .",
    "these parameters best represent the foreground , galactic polarization properties ( localized in the dust associated with the taurus cloud complex ) along the line of sight to the t - galaxy .",
    "it should be noted that the portion of the line of sight between the farthest galactic star and the t - galaxy is not represented in our sample of stellar probes .",
    "however , the likelihood of that region having sufficient magnetic field tracing dust at these galactic latitudes to affect the color and polarization of the t - galaxy is low . alternatively , the galactic foreground stellar polarizations could be affected by partially canceling polarization components along the different pathlengths to the stars .",
    "the general coherence of the magnetic field orientations revealed in figure  [ fig_deep_image ] and the close agreement of the stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 values for the two subsamples make this also unlikely .",
    "finally , because the foreground polarization is small and the optical depth at @xmath0 band is much less than unity , subtraction of the fg stokes percentages from the observed @xmath7 and @xmath8 percentage images for the t - galaxy is sufficient to correct the polarization properties for the effects of the foreground taurus layer .    in summary ,",
    "the steps taken to develop images of the intrinsic nir polarization of the t - galaxy begin with forming the four ippa images from the 16 hwp images and using these to generate stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 percentage images and their uncertainty images .",
    "these were each smoothed , using a gaussian of 1.75 arcsec fwhm with inverse variance squared weighting from the uncertainty images . from the smoothed @xmath7 and @xmath8 images , the foreground contributions @xmath29 and @xmath30 were subtracted .",
    "the new @xmath7 and @xmath8 images and their uncertainty images were combined to form @xmath31 and p.a.@xmath32 images ( and uncertainties ) , where the subscript ` cor ' denotes correction for the foreground contributions .",
    "finally , the polarization percentage uncertainty image was used to ricean - correct the polarization percentage image to yield a @xmath33 image . to allow comparison with radio synchrotron maps , the stokes @xmath10 image",
    "was multiplied by the @xmath33 image to produce a polarized intensity ( @xmath34 ) image .",
    "all of these quantities are displayed for the central @xmath35 arcsec of the t - galaxy in figure  [ fig_p_cor ] and described in detail in section 5.2 , below .",
    "in addition to correcting for the foreground polarization effects , correcting for the reddening by the taurus layer is necessary in order to obtain accurate colors for the t - galaxy . in particular , reddening correction in the @xmath36 color is needed to allow comparing the t - galaxy polarimetry and dust column densities to similar values for the milky way and edge - on galaxies @xcite .",
    "such an assessment can reveal whether the polarization measured across the t - galaxy is dominated by dichroic ( selective ) extinction , and so able to trace magnetic fields , or whether scattering dominates and is unable to reveal magnetic field properties .",
    "several photometric data sets were available for estimating the extinction and reddening along this sight line , up through the dr7 data release from the galactic cluster survey ( gcs ) of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss : * ? ? ?",
    "methods for estimating reddening and extinction from broadband photometric data include near - infrared color excess ( nice : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nice - revisited ( nicer : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and rayleigh - jeans color excess ( rjce : * ? ? ?",
    "the appendix summarizes the steps , tests , and potential pitfalls associated with estimating the foreground extinction along this line of sight from these multiple data sets and methods .",
    "the values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 finally adopted were @xmath39 mag and @xmath40 mag , respectively .",
    "the figure  [ fig_deep_image ] field was observed here only through a single filter ( @xmath0 ) using mimir .",
    "so , to examine the color variation across the t - galaxy , 2mass images in @xmath41 , @xmath0 , and @xmath42 bands were examined , and an @xmath36 color map was formed .",
    "this observed color map was corrected for the foreground color ( 0.125 mag ) and a second correction of 0.15 mag was subtracted .",
    "this latter value is that typically used in the nice method @xcite as representing the average intrinsic color for field stars ( in the absence of a reference field color distribution ) .",
    "the net effect was the production of a color excess @xmath5 map to use as a proxy for dust column density across the t - galaxy .",
    "the distribution of this 2mass - traced color excess is shown in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig_e_hk_4 ] , with its uncertainty shown in the upper right panel .",
    "the @xmath5 panel reveals weak , but significant color shifts across the face of the t - galaxy .",
    "two symmetric arm - like features are seen to the east and west of the galaxy center as regions of increased reddening , surrounded by regions of decreased reddening . using the orientation and inclination properties described in section 3 , a deprojected and rotated version of the @xmath5 map",
    "was calculated and is presented in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig_e_hk_4 ] .",
    "axes for this panel are presented as linear offsets along the directions of the ( projected ) major and minor axes , based on the distance to the t - galaxy .",
    "if the two reddened arm - like features are spiral arms , they are located only 1 - 2 kpc from the galaxy center .",
    "they likely correspond to the photometric feature noted at four arcsec radial offset in section 3 as possibly indicating the presence of spiral arms .",
    "note that this representation only spans the inner 5 kpc where color uncertainties are small ; the full photometric extent is about twice as large .    finally , the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig_e_hk_4 ] displays a classification of zones in the t - galaxy , selected for their color excess uncertainty , polarization percentage uncertainty , and , for two of the zones , their color excess values .",
    "the selection criteria are listed in the second through fourth columns of table  [ tbl_p_vs_ehk ] .",
    "classification names of ` core , ' ` bulge , ' ` interarm , ' ` arms , ' and ` outer ' reflect their locations and color properties .",
    "the first two zones have the smallest uncertainties of color excess and polarization , but no color value selection .",
    "these criteria map to the brightest pixels in the t - galaxy stokes @xmath10 image .",
    "the next two zones have identical color excess and polarization uncertainty criteria , but were split into two groups about @xmath43 mag .",
    "this produces an ` arms ' zone that encompasses at least the inner , more certain color excess and polarization locations showing the redder extinctions identified in figure  [ fig_e_hk_4].a , as distinct from the ` interarm ' zones that exhibit bluer colors . finally , the ` outer ' zone collects the remaining locations for which the polarization uncertainty is under 1.2% .",
    "analysis of the t - galaxy classified into these five zones with the foreground - corrected polarization properties ( see next section ) , enabled testing for correlations between polarization and color excess that may relate to zone classification and galaxy structure .",
    "the foreground corrected polarization properties for the t - galaxy are shown for the central @xmath35 arcsec in figure  [ fig_p_cor ] .",
    "the upper left panel ( figure  [ fig_p_cor].a ) shows contours of polarized intensity @xmath34 overlaid on a false color logarithmic representation of the stokes @xmath10 image .",
    "there , the brightest peak in @xmath34 is offset to the north of the photometric center , while a weaker secondary peak is offset to the south .",
    "an alternate explanation is that the photometric peak is bisected by a depolarization feature that is distributed somewhat linearly and mostly parallel to the major axis , as though the bright bulge were shadowed , at least polarimetrically , by the intervening disk .",
    "superposition of disk - parallel and disk - normal ( vertical ) magnetic fields could also account for the apparent depolarization .",
    "the @xmath34 image shows extensions along the major axis to the nw and se , with hints of localized maxima at the ends of the major axis .",
    "the polarization percentage image ( figure  [ fig_p_cor].b ) reveals polarizations of about 12% across most of the extent of the t - galaxy . there is a prominent zone of nearly zero polarization percentage surrounding the isolated 1% polarized feature centered at an offset of @xmath44 arcsec",
    "this same feature shows distinctly different p.a .",
    "values ( figure  [ fig_p_cor].c ) than the remainder of the t - galaxy .",
    "most of the t - galaxy shows a relatively uniform p.a . of about 130 , which is similar to the major axis position angle on the sky .",
    "when the corrected polarization percentage and position angle data are combined with the photometric image , the result , shown in figure  [ fig_p_cor].d , reveals coherent behavior across many kpc of separation .",
    "the vectors shown represent the @xmath33 and p.a.@xmath32 behavior averaged over @xmath45 pixels ( @xmath24fwhm seeing ) and rendered only every three pixels in each direction to preserve independence .",
    "a predominance of disk - parallel polarization is seen , though in the region sw of the center the polarization vectors become disk - normal .",
    "this sw feature may be evidence for a vertical ( poloidal ) magnetic field or it could signify scattering of bulge light by disk or halo dust .",
    "the absence of a symmetric zone of disk - normal polarizations to the ne of the center would seem to favor the latter explanation .",
    "overall , the nir polarizations look remarkably similar to many of the radio synchrotron polarization maps of the disk portions of edge - on galaxies , such as those in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in particular , the combined effelsberg 100 m and vla radio polarization map of ngc5775 by @xcite exhibits virtually all of the same magnetic field characteristics as seen in the nir for the t - galaxy .",
    "both galaxies show nearly edge - on disks dominated by disk - parallel magnetic fields .",
    "the ngc5775 radio map ( figure 7 of @xcite ) shows the same disk - normal component offset from the center to the sw as seen here in figure  [ fig_p_cor].d .",
    "the ngc5775 radio observations are better able to probe fields in the warm ionized plasma and reveal an ` x - shaped ' halo field off of the disk plane ( a model is sketched in figure 12 of @xcite ) .",
    "the nir of figure  [ fig_p_cor].d may be revealing a similar x - shaped halo field to the sw , but some caution must be applied , as the nir polarization is more strongly affected by scattering than would apply to the radio .",
    "it is fortuitous that the vla observations of ngc5775 and the nir data reported here for the t - galaxy have about the same effective resolutions ( about 10 - 15 independent samples along the luminous disks ) , though ngc5775 is at half the distance of the t - galaxy and is twice as large , physically .",
    "nir polarimetry of ngc5775 could help establish whether the radio x - shaped halo fields are capable of being revealed in the nir .",
    "the nir better traces the cool , star - forming ism in the t - galaxy , revealing a coherent magnetic field with a disk - parallel orientation over extents as large as 4 kpc .",
    "in addition , there is weak indication of a rise in polarization percentage and p.a . flaring near the ends of the major axis that may hint at connections to a more vertical orientation for a halo magnetic field of the t - galaxy or a decrease in the disk - parallel field strength . at present , there are no radio observations of the t - galaxy which would permit direct comparison with the nir . based on the nir observations , a disk - parallel orientation for the b - field",

    "thus the sight lines through the t - galaxy disk will be geometrically shorter , though they could still achieve significant optical depths .",
    "this is true even at @xmath0 band , because although the dust extinction per unit gas column is much less than in the optical , scattering efficiency can be more than twice as high @xcite .",

    "a similar weak rise in polarization with distance from a bright central region was noted by @xcite for the case of the nuclear region of ic  694 in arp  299 .",
    "he argued that this was a result of the change from poloidal to toroidal magnetic field dominance in the polarizing path length .",
    "alternatively , the central region of the t - galaxy could be suffering either depolarizing due to long pathlengths through the intervening disk or a transition from dichroism in the ne disk to single scattering in the sw portion .      in the modeling of @xcite ,",
    "such ` polarization nulls ' near , but offset from photometric centers arise from an admixture of scattering and magnetic field induced dichroic extinction producing a ` crossed - polaroid ' effect .",

    "none of the p.a .",
    "values line up with the centrosymmetric zone , ruling out strong centrally - illuminated single scattering dominating the nir polarization pattern for the t - galaxy .",

    "in exploiting the opportunity provided by the serendipitous nir polarimetric observation of the t - galaxy , as augmented by analyses of other existing stellar data , have clear understandings emerged regarding the nature of the t - galaxy and how its properties might relate to those in the milky way and other normal galaxies ?",
    "first , is the t - galaxy a milky way analog ?",
    "is it a disk galaxy that lacks a central agn ( so that the polarization observed is not agn related ) ?",
    "the decomposition of the stokes @xmath10 image into bulge and disk components argues for a significant bulge contribution to the total luminosity , but not one so high as to be agn dominated .",
    "the b / t ratio and petrosian concentration index are both comparable to values seen for other disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as are the surface brightness , disk scale length , and bulge scale length @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy of the nucleus could test for the presence of an agn , though @xcite do not comment on this .",
    "our own hk - band spectroscopy shows a cool stellar population ( thermal - like ) spectrum , that is unchanged when deextincted .",
    "further , the lack of narrow or broad emission lines in our hk spectrum argues against the presence of a strong agn .",
    "a fairly conservative upper limit of 0.15% of the t - galaxy luminosity for its nuclear emission lines was arrived at through combining three times the noise in the spectrum with a notional linewidth of 150 km s@xmath23 .",
    "such a low upper limit on the spectral line power for the nucleus of the t - galaxy rules out normal seyferts and other agns .",
    "the bulge to disk luminosity ratio is consistent with sb - sbc types @xcite .",
    "a bump at four arcsec radial offset in the photometric profile of the mimir @xmath0 band image used in the srsic fits hinted at possible spiral arms .",
    "the 2mass @xmath36 color excess image , after foreground reddening correction , showed evidence for symmetric red features emanating from the vicinity of the core / bulge and extending to the t - galaxy edges .",
    "these red features are likely to be tracing the dust enhancements expected for spiral arms in the t - galaxy and they appear at the right radial offset to match the photometric bump . the 2.3 kpc circular radius to 90% of the petrosian flux is significantly smaller than the extent of the milky way disk , but other aspects indicate that the t - galaxy is a fair , though smaller , milky way analog .",
    "second , have magnetic fields in the t - galaxy been detected ?",
    "polarization can arise from many sources , though in the nir , generally only scattering and dichroic extinction will dominate in normal galaxies .",
    "modeling by @xcite and @xcite of nir polarization from steeply inclined disk galaxies explored the observational effects of each of scattering and dichroic extinction alone , as well as together .",
    "when scattering dominates , @xcite found that face - on galaxies show strong centrosymmetric polarization patterns and edge - on galaxies show polarizations perpendicular to the disk .",
    "dichroic extinction tends to produce polarizations parallel to the disk , since the disk magnetic field they modeled was toroidal .",
    "the model of mixed scattering plus dichroism for an inclined galaxy , shown as figure  3 ( center ) in @xcite , contains many of the polarization features and properties present in figure  [ fig_p_cor].d here .    the azimuthal variation of polarization p.a.s , shown here as figure  [ fig_pa_vs_az ] , reveals both the negative - sloped swing of p.a .",
    "for the higher mean polarization ( ne ; near ) side of the t - galaxy disk as well as the strong positive unity - sloped p.a .",
    "swing that signifies radial ( single scattering ) for the lower mean polarization ( sw ; far ) side of the disk .",
    "this azimuthal variation is also seen in the radio polarization map of ngc5775 @xcite .",
    "similar quantitative characterizations in future modeling studies could help sharpen comparisons and interpretations .",
    "this would also address whether nir and radio polarizations are both probing halo magnetic fields equally or if the nir is affected by scattering .",
    "the overall match of the t - galaxy polarization percentages and color excesses with the milky way based jkd model and with the values seen toward the edge - on galaxy ngc 4565 , shown in figure  [ fig_p_vs_ehk ] , argue for a common magnetic field plus dichroic extinction origin for the polarizations and reddenings from these three galaxies .    at present",
    ", the t - galaxy lacks resolved kinematic observations , which are needed to ascertain the rotation direction .",
    "the polarization map does reveal a broken symmetry about the major axis , which interpreted under current models was used to predict the near and far - side locations of the t - galaxy disk .",
    "the same map also showed coherent p.a . swings .",
    "kinematic data would be able to test these near - side / far - side predictions .",
    "this galaxy was not targeted , but was contained in a field of deep taurus stellar observations , and these stellar values were able to reveal and calibrate the foreground polarization properties .",
    "the stellar polarization properties show the orientation of the local galactic magnetic field contained within the taurus layer and could be combined with observations from _",
    "planck _ to improve the removal of galactic foregrounds from cmbr observations aimed at mapping b modes @xcite .",
    "deep @xmath0 band linear polarization observations toward one @xmath9 arcmin field in taurus serendipitously contained an inclined , 53 mpc distant , ( small ) milky way analog galaxy .",
    "the polarization data were sensitive enough to permit measuring the intrinsic polarization generated by the combination of magnetic fields and aligned dust grains across nearly the full extent of that galaxy .    because the galaxy was observed _ through _ the gas and dust in the taurus molecular cloud complex ,",
    "it was necessary to measure and remove the foreground contributions by taurus to the distant galaxy polarization , extinction , and reddening . the foreground extinction and reddening were measured using multiple methods applied to several stellar photometric data sets . corrected for this reddening , an @xmath38 color excess map of the galaxy revealed red spiral arms at locations in agreement with a photometric bump in the radial @xmath0 band profile .",
    "once foreground - corrected , the distant galaxy nir polarizations were found to be comparable to milky way stellar values , indicating that they most likely are tracing the uniform component of the magnetic field in the galaxy disk .",
    "the field revealed shows remarkable similarities to the magnetic fields revealed by radio synchrotron polarimetry of edge - on disk galaxies .",
    "as nir polarimetry for this galaxy mostly arises from dichroic extinction in the cool , star - forming interstellar medium and radio synchrotron arises in a much warmer component , the correspondence of the magnetic field patterns for the two favors a single uniform magnetic field threading both components .",
    "a broken symmetry in the degree of polarization and its orientation direction with respect to the major axis was found , likely due to a change in the relative mix of dichroic absorption and scattering from the ne front and sw back sides of the disk of that galaxy .",
    "the approach of using the stellar foreground polarization properties to characterize the local , galactic magnetic field projected orientation could prove useful for constraining models aiming to correct _ planck _",

    "<S> few normal galaxies have been probed using near - infrared polarimetry , even though it reveals magnetic fields in the cool interstellar medium better than either optical or radio polarimetry . deep @xmath0  band ( 1.6  @xmath1 m ) linear imaging polarimetry toward taurus serendipitously included the galaxy 2masx  j04412715 + 2433110 with adequate sensitivity and resolution to map polarization across nearly its full extent . </S>",
    "<S> the observations revealed the galaxy to be a steeply inclined ( @xmath2 ) disk type with a diameter , encompassing 90% of the petrosian flux , of 4.2 kpc at a distance of 53  mpc . because the sight line passes through the taurus molecular cloud complex , the foreground polarization needed to be measured and removed . </S>",
    "<S> the foreground extinction a@xmath3 of 2.00@xmath40.10  mag and reddening @xmath5 of 0.125@xmath40.009  mag were also assessed and removed , based on analysis of 2mass , ukidss , _ spitzer _ , and _ wise _ photometry using the nice , nicer , and rjce methods . </S>",
    "<S> corrected for the polarized foreground , the galaxy polarization values range from zero to 3% . </S>",
    "<S> the polarizations are dominated by a disk - parallel magnetic field geometry , especially to the northeast , while either a vertical field or single scattering of bulge light produces disk - normal polarizations to the southwest . </S>",
    "<S> the multi - kpc coherence of the magnetic field revealed by the infrared polarimetry is in close agreement with short wavelength radio synchrotron observations of edge - on galaxies , indicating that both cool and warm interstellar media of disk galaxies may be threaded by common magnetic fields . </S>"
