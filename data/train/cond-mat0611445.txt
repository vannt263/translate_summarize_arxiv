    "in previous work we have described quantum logic gates based on the rf .",
    "the basic operation involved is an adiabatic inversion , where the reverses flux states under the sweep of an external field @xmath1 .",
    "this is equivalent to the logical not @xcite .",
    "when a second is added whose flux can add or subtract from , parameter ranges were found for the two @xmath2 so that the two - undergoes a reshuffling of levels equivalent to the logical operation cnot @xcite,@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of these systems by numerical simulations which enable us to examine these processes in more quantitative detail . among the points we can examine",
    "is the validity of the `` spin 1/2 picture '' . in the previous work we often found good agreement with a simplified",
    " spin 1/2 analogy \" where the two lowest states of each are treated as an effective two - state system .",
    "this picture is very useful in understanding and predicting the behavior of the s and here we examine its validity by simulations for the full many - state system",
    ".    a further question which can be studied in detail is .",
    "this is the operating principle for our quantum gates and it is necessary to know under which conditions it holds .    finally , we can use our programs to study the effects of on the quantum gates .",
    "we will examine how to introduce as a noise signal and study its effects on our operations .",
    "it should be stressed that our results would have been difficult if not impossible to obtain without the extensive of numerical programs . due to the sensitivity to the various parameters and the subtleties of the tunneling problem",
    ", analytic methods would be difficult and uncertain . with the high accuracy programs",
    ", a short run can replaces otherwise long , complicated , and often approximate formulas .",
    "we begin by shortly reviewing our approach  @xcite ,  @xcite as applied to the one variable , one rf , at first without . this will allow us to fix the notation and parameters , and to establish the connection between the full and the `` spin 1/2 picture '' .",

    "the variable @xmath9 is the flux @xmath10 in the loop in flux quantum units @xmath11 , and furthermore shifted by @xmath12 so that @xmath13 corresponds to the maximum at the center of the double potential well @xmath14 .",
    "similarly @xmath1 is an external field , where due to the shift , @xmath15 corresponds to a non - zero applied field of size @xmath16 . by factoring out an overall energy scale @xmath17 so that @xmath18 we obtain the dimensionless hamiltonian    @xmath19+\\beta\\ , cos\\phi\\}={-1\\over 2\\xi } { \\partial ^2\\over\\partial \\phi^2 }   + \\xi \\{{{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}}[(\\phi-\\phi^{ext})^2 ] + \\beta\\ , cos\\phi\\}\\;.\\ ] ]    with this choice of the factor @xmath20 the `` mass '' @xmath21 and the `` potential '' @xmath22 are equal , hence the second form in terms of a common parameter @xmath23 , whose value is @xmath24 . in effect",
    "the capacitance c and inductance l have been exchanged for an energy scale @xmath20 and a dimensionless number @xmath23 .",
    "we shall discuss the physical meaning of @xmath23 below .    in the following we shall endeavor to express all energies in terms of the general energy unit @xmath20 and all times in the time unit @xmath25 . to converted these to dimensional units one multiplies by @xmath26 and for the time by @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "thus results with the dimensionless , eq  [ hama1 ] , which we will use in our computer simulations , are to be converted to physical energies by multiplying by @xmath20 .",
    "typical values @xmath28 and @xmath29 for example , yield @xmath30 and @xmath31 , while the time unit is @xmath32 .",
    "we will use these values for `` typical examples '' or when absolute times or energies are needed .",
    "we shall usually work with @xmath33 , which for @xmath28 corresponds to a critical current of about @xmath34 .    to carry out calculations with eq  [ hama1 ] for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , the numerical method employed a large basis of harmonic oscillator and expanded the cosine as a low order polynomial . since in the harmonic oscillator basis",
    "polynomials are simple , sparse , matrices , the problem is reduced to algebraic manipulations and a matrix diagonalization .",
    "it was usually found that an expansion up to 8th order for the cosine and a basis of 256 oscillator states gave numerical stability .",
    "a typical run with a few hundred basis vectors on a pentium 4 machine lasts less than a minute and resolves our smallest energy splitting to better than two significant figures .",
    "eq  [ hama1 ] contains three parameters , , @xmath0 and @xmath23 .",
    "the applied flux   controls the asymmetry of the potential and for = 0 the potential is symmetric .",
    "fig.1 , left , shows an example with the potential in this symmetric configuration . in this `` level crossing ''",
    "situation the energy splitting of the lowest pair of levels is just the tunneling energy @xmath35 and so is quite small .",
    "here it is 0.0044 and not clearly resolved on the plot .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have presented a description of one or two interacting rf s in a form suitable for numerical simulation and a of programs for carrying out these simulations .",
    "in addition to static properties , the behavior under time dependent conditions , including flux sweeps for gates , and the effects of noise or , were studied .    among the points investigated was the validity of the `` spin 1/2 picture '' where the behavior governed by the full is approximated by the components of an effective `` spin 1/2 '' using the lowest levels of the double - potential well .",
    "the identification between the parameters of the spin and the full was established and the regime of validity of the approximation were investigated numerically .",
    "it is found , using various criteria , including `` hilbert space completeness '' , that the `` spin 1/2 '' picture is approximately valid up to variations of the external bias which moves the basic pair of levels a substantial fraction of the principal level splitting .",
    "for the two , we have found it is capable of performing the logical operation cnot , and have been able to determine regions of the plane with definite configurations of the suitable for cnot sweeps .",
    "the conditions for behavior under such sweeps were examined and times found for typical parameters .",
    "the splitting @xmath35 of the basic pair enters into the condition and is very sensitive to the barrier parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it is found that the most interesting regions for this parameter are values slightly greater than one , and detailed studies were presented for @xmath33 .",
    "noise or were simulated as a random flux noise and a formula was derived relating the parameters of this random noise to the parameter d. numerical simulations verify the validity of the formula .",
    "this random noise is then applied to the logic gates and possible regimes of operation for the gates are found .",
    "one of the interesting conclusions is that the sweep time can be substantially longer than the time 1/d before effects become very large .",
    "this is traced to the fact that , and also non- , are mostly effective at `` level crossing '' , which is only a small part of the sweep . indeed for the two - cnot gate it is found that noise applied to the control bit , which does not undergo a `` level crossing '' , has almost no effect .",
    "one of our general conclusions therefore , for any devices of this general type , is that `` level crossings '' should be held to a minimum , and when they occur a large tunneling energy or splitting at `` crossing '' is beneficial both for reducing both and non - effects .",
    "it thus appears that an interesting region for the engineering of gates involves rather small values of @xmath0 , where the splitting is large .",
    "however the are then nearly delocalized .",
    "we have examined the case @xmath36 , where the reduced tunnel barrier and thus large @xmath35 permit fast operation of the gates .",
    "the resulting short time for the to act leads to operations which are successful with presently discussed values of the time , some nanoseconds .",
    "however , a careful choice of parameters is necessary .    generally speaking",
    ", we may say that our studies verify that it is in principal possible to have a regime where one can create and manipulate quantum linear combinations of quasi - classical objects , as pictured in fig.9 .",
    "while the parameters and examples we have used are specific to the rf , it will be recognized that our methods and results will apply , after some adjustments , to almost all interacting double - potential well systems .",
