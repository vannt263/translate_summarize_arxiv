    "a harmonic function on a graph is a function @xmath3 from its vertices into @xmath7 such that for every vertex @xmath8 , @xmath9 is equal to the average of @xmath3 over all the neighbours of @xmath8 .",
    "finite connected graphs have no nonconstant harmonic functions , and infinite ones have , in many interesting examples , surprisingly small families of harmonic functions . for example , on the graph @xmath10 , the only harmonic functions with polynomial growth are polynomials @xcite . when the graph is the cayley graph of some finitely generated group , it is natural to try to relate properties of harmonic functions to properties of the group .",
    "graphs for which there are no nonconstant bounded harmonic functions are called liouville graphs , and they are deeply connected with random walk entropy and amenability @xcite .",
    "it is well - known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that any infinite cayley graph supports harmonic functions of linear growth . in a different regime ,",
    "harmonic functions with linear growth were used by kleiner to give a new proof of gromov s famous polynomial growth theorem @xcite .",
    "there is an interesting quantitative version of the liouville question which goes as follows : for a given cayley graph , what is the largest @xmath11 such that any harmonic function @xmath12 with @xmath13 is constant ?",
    "( 1 is of course the identity element of the group , and @xmath14 is the graphical distance in the cayley graph ) .",
    "this question was addressed in @xcite where a number of examples where analysed .",
    "in particular , for the two dimensional lamplighter group @xmath15 it was shown that it supports a harmonic function with logarithmic growth , but that any @xmath12 with @xmath16 is constant .",
    "surprisingly , though , it turns out that this can not be changed by using more complicated lamps .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that for @xmath17 the same behaviour holds , namely , any sublogarithmic harmonic function must be constant ( in sharp contrast to the behaviour of random walk return probabilities and entropy on @xmath1 ) .    in this paper",
    "we construct examples of groups with any @xmath3 between @xmath18 and constant .",
    "here is the precise statement    let @xmath3 be a positive @xmath19 function on @xmath20 such that @xmath21 and such that @xmath22 is decreasing .",
    "then there exists a finitely generated group @xmath1 and a finite , symmetric set of generators @xmath2 such that the cayley graph @xmath23 has the following properties :    1",
    ".   there exists a nonconstant harmonic function @xmath12 on @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "any harmonic function @xmath12 on @xmath23 with @xmath25 is constant .",
    "it is a famous open problem whether the liouville property is a group property , i.e.  whether it is possible for the same group to have two sets of generators with respect to which one cayley graph is liouville and the other is not .",
    "( it is known that the liouville property is not _ quasi - isometrically invariant _ for general graphs , see @xcite ) . in our case too , we do not know whether the minimal growth rate of a harmonic function is a group property or it might depend on the generators . for the _ specific _ groups we are constructing , though , it is possible to show that any set of generators has the same minimal growth of harmonic functions",
    ". we will not prove it , though , as it only adds technical complications to the proof .",
    "let us warn the reader against confusing a harmonic function of minimal growth with a minimal harmonic function .",
    "a positive harmonic function @xmath12 is called minimal if any other positive harmonic function @xmath26 with @xmath27 for all @xmath28 is a multiple of @xmath12 by a constant .",
    "such functions play a role in the construction of the martin boundary of a group .",
    "surprisingly , perhaps , minimal harmonic functions in fact grow very fast .",
    "for example , in @xmath29 they actually grow exponentially fast .",
    "a minimal harmonic function @xmath12 on @xmath29 will have a very specific `` direction '' in which it decays exponentially fast and this prevents any other harmonic function from being smaller than @xmath12 _ everywhere _ , but in a typical direction @xmath12 will increase exponentially .",
    "we will not prove these claims as they are somewhat off topic , but they follow in a more - or - less straightforward manner from the description of minimal harmonic functions using busemann functions with respect to the green metric , see @xcite .",
    "our construction uses _ permutational wreath products _  an approach with a very successful track record in constructing groups with interesting behaviour  but with the following twist .",
    "a permutational wreath product ( exact definitions will be given below ) starts from a group acting on a set @xmath6 . in most constructions",
    "so far the groups were automaton groups , and these act naturally on certain sets such that the result is a `` graphical fractal '' .",
    "these groups and their actions have been studied extensively , and the construction requires deep knowledge of this theory . here , instead of starting with a well - studied group ,",
    "we start with a graph ( which we also denote by @xmath6 , the group will act on its vertices ) .",
    "we colour the edges of the graph such that any vertex is incident to all colours , and then use the colouring to construct a group acting on @xmath6 .",
    "each colour ( say azure ) will correspond to the permutation of @xmath6 given by taking every vertex @xmath28 to the vertex on the other side of the edge @xmath30 incident to @xmath28 and coloured azure .",
    "the group will simply be the group of permutations generated by all the colours .",
    "we shall see that if the colouring is chosen to have enough repetitions , then the group may be analysed directly and quite simply , with no need for the heavy combinatorial analysis typically associated with automaton groups .",
    "while not a truly different technique , more of a different way to think about existing techniques , we believe it is useful , and in fact it has already been used in @xcite .",
    "for a graph @xmath1 and two vertices @xmath28 and @xmath31 we denote by @xmath32 the case where @xmath33 is an edge of @xmath1 , and say that @xmath28 and @xmath31 are neighbours . by @xmath34 or @xmath35",
    "we denote the graphical distance between them i.e.  the length of the shortest path between them in the graph ( if one exists ; @xmath36 otherwise ) .",

    "we shall also use @xmath1 to denote the set of vertices of @xmath1 , so @xmath42 means that @xmath28 is a vertex of @xmath1 .",
    "if we need the set of edges of @xmath1 , we shall denote it by @xmath43 . for two graphs @xmath1 and @xmath44 we denote by @xmath45 the standard graph product i.e. the graph with vertex set @xmath46 and with @xmath47 if and only if @xmath48 and @xmath49 or @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    ", we define @xmath62 to be the electrical resistance between them , i.e.  construct an electrical network where each edge has resistance @xmath63 , and where the sets @xmath56 and @xmath64 are fused to be one point each , and then measure the resulting effective resistance between these two points . for a formal definition",
    "see , say , the book @xcite .",
    "we shall consider the effective resistance between a point and the boundary of a ball around it with radius @xmath59 , and the main property of effective resistance that we shall use is that this resistance is inversely proportional to the probability that a random walk starting from the point will hit the boundary of the ball before returning .",

    "other properties of electrical resistance will only be used to estimate the resistance in the schreier graphs ( lemmas [ l : inf_seq ] and [ lem : res nvn ] ) .",

    "here and below , when we write @xmath95 we consider the group @xmath96 to be embedded in @xmath7 as @xmath97 and @xmath95 is then just multiplication in @xmath7 .",
    "some readers might benefit from thinking about @xmath98 as the _ harmonic potential _ ( see e.g.  @xcite ) at @xmath91 , through we are not making any requirement that @xmath98 be minimal in any sense .",
    "this is a straightforward , if confusing , calculation .",

    "we now reveal the nature of the graph in question : it will be a product of a spherically symmetric tree with @xmath113 .",
    "we therefore start with some properties of spherically symmetric trees and random walks on them .",
