    "we present a partly novel derivation of some basic results , and some new results , for the ` equilibrium tide ' model of tidal friction ( hut 1981 ) .",
    "we derive the force and couple on a binary orbit that arises from dissipation of the equilibrium tide , starting only from the principles that ( a ) the rate of dissipation of energy should be a positive definite function of the rate of change of the tide , as viewed in a frame which rotates with the star , and ( b ) the total angular momentum is conserved .",
    "this model leads to a force and couple which are similar to those derived classically on the assumption that the tidal bulge lags the line of centres by some small time that is determined by the timescale of dissipation .",
    "however in our model the lag time is determined to be proportional to the quadrupole moment , rather than assumed to be independent of it .",
    "there is a clear relation between the rate of dissipation and the lag time .",
    "we also determine the relation between the hypothesised dissipation constant and the turbulent viscosity within the star .",
    "however there remains the more difficult task of determining the turbulent velocity field .",
    "there are two principle formalisms for discussing the effect of tidal dissipation on an orbit : the ` equilibrium tide ' model ( darwin 1880 , alexander 1973 , hut 1981 , hut 1992 ) and the ` dynamical tide ' model ( fabian , pringle & rees 1975 , zahn 1975 , press & teukolsky 1977 , mcmillan , mcdermott & taam 1987 , goldreich & nicholson 1989 , lai 1996 , kumar & goodman 1997 , kumar & quataert 1997 , papaloizou & savonije 1997 , savonije et al .",
    "1983 , 1984 , 1995 , 1997 , mardling 1995 ) . in the former",
    "the star is perceived as being perturbed to a shape closely approximating the shape it would have in equilibrium with the ( time - dependent ) gravitational - centrifugal potential of the system .",
    "dissipation by viscosity of the internal motion caused by the time - variation of the tide causes the orbit to tend towards circularity , and causes the spin to be brought into parallelism with the orbit , until the tide ceases to be time - dependent in the limit that the orbit is circular and the spin parallel to the orbit ( hut 1980 ) . in the latter formalism",
    ", the star is perceived as an oscillator with a number of normal modes that are excited by the time - dependent potential as the companion passes by at periastron . in a close encounter from an initially parabolic ( or highly eccentric ) orbit ,",
    "energy is extracted from the orbital motion and locked up in the oscillation of the star s normal modes .",
    "each mode is damped at some rate , the higher - order modes being damped more rapidly . if the modes are all damped during the long apastron phase , then the process can repeat itself at the next periastron , and thus represents a long - term drain of orbital energy intothermal energy . since the angular momentum is constant",
    "while energy is dissipated , we expect the orbit to become more circular .",
    "if the modes damp slowly , they may still be active at the next periastron , and because the frequencies of oscillation are not necessarily commensurate with the frequency of the orbit , each periastron passsage may be different from the previous one ; some oscillations may be in phase and excited resonantly , while others may be out of phase .",
    "it is possible for the orbit to be decircularised instead of circularised , and in some circumstances it may vary chaotically .",
    "even for circular orbits , dynamical tides can continue to operate , as long as there still are deviations from synchronous rotation ( zahn 1975 , goldreich & nicholson 1989 ) .",
    "these two models are not necessarily in competition .",
    "rather , it is likely that the first prevails in cases where an orbit is only moderately eccentric , and reasonably wide in the sense that both stars are small compared with their periastron separation .",
    "the latter may prevail in circumstances ( ` tidal capture ' ) where two stars approach initially on a parabolic or slightly hyperbolic orbit , and interact briefly and dramatically near periastron . in the former case it is likely that only the lowest order ( quadrupolar ) mode will be significantly excited , as in the case of tides on earth .",
    "we concentrate here on the equilibrium - tide model , which we develop using a mathematical - physical treatment which we believe to be unusually clear and simple .    in @xmath0 2",
    ", we derive an approximation to the quadrupole tensor of the mass distribution in a star of mass @xmath1 distorted by the combination of ( a ) uniform rotation @xmath2 , and ( b ) the presence of a companion of mass @xmath3 at position * d*(t ) relative to the centre of @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath2 is not necessarily perpendicular to * d * , and neither is @xmath5 .",
    "we deal only with the lowest , _",
    "i.e_.  quadrupole , mode because it is much the simplest ; we can operate entirely within the linear regime , and extract results that are exact to first order . including higher modes",
    "involves ultimately working in the non - linear regime , and one gains only a modest increase of accuracy , if any , at the expense of considerable extra complexity . in @xmath0 3 , we show that if the mechanical energy of the motion ( orbital energy plus rotational energy ) is dissipated at a rate which is proportional to the square of the rate of change of the quadrupole tensor , then a force ( and associated couple ) is introduced into the system which is equivalent to the assumption that the tidal bulge lags behind the line - of - centres by some time which depends on the rate of dissipation . in @xmath0 4 ,",
    "we use the concept of the laplace - runge - lenz ( lrl ) vector to determine relatively easily the effect on the binary orbit of an arbitrary perturbing force . in @xmath0 5",
    "we apply this analysis to the dissipative force obtained in @xmath0 3 , in combination with the non - dissipative force that is already present simply because of the quadrupolar distortion of @xmath0 2 .",
    "the standard equations are recovered relatively simply in the case that @xmath2 is parallel to the orbital angular momentum ; and we obtain the complete equations for the case that they are not parallel . in @xmath0 6",
    "we derive the tidal velocity field and its rate of dissipation by turbulent viscosity .",
    "this leads to a specific value for the dissipation constant of @xmath0 3 . in @xmath0 7",
    "we determine briefly the meridional circulation current ( eddington 1925 , vogt 1925 , sweet 1950 , mestel 1965 ) that is implicit in the distortion determined in @xmath0 2 .",
    "however this circulation current must be taken with a pinch of salt since it shows several singularities in the outer layers of hot stars . in @xmath0 8",
    "we discuss uncertainties in the model , and mention briefly possible applications of the model to ( a ) the circularisation of a pulsar orbit around a normal star , and ( b ) the effect on a close binary orbit of the presence of a distant third star in a hierarchical triple system .",
    "consider a binary consisting of an extended star ( @xmath6 , which rotates with constant uniform angular velocity @xmath2 , and a point - mass companion ( @xmath7 ) at a distance @xmath8 from it . in a frame which rotates with @xmath4 , and has origin at the cm of @xmath4 , the equation of motion of the fluid of @xmath4 is @xmath9 where * r *  is a vector from the cm of the extended star to a general point in it , and @xmath10 is the derivative following the motion .",

    "the constancy of @xmath20 on equipotentials , and hence of @xmath29 also at least in the case of chemically homogeneous stars , means that in the heat equation we have to introduce a velocity field , the ` circulation current ' , to maintain thermal equilibrium ( @xmath0 7 ) .",
    "we assume this field is sufficiently small that we can still neglect @xmath30 in eq .",
    "the theory developed in @xmath31 2  6 does not require any knowledge of the circulation velocity , only supposing that it is small so that the approximation of @xmath20 constant on equipotentials is valid .",

    "it has long been suspected ( maeder 1975 ) that stars have larger convective cores than can be accounted for by ` standard ' assumptions about convective stability .",
    "although several different models for this have been proposed , they are not consistent with each other ( eggleton 1983 ) . but even in the absence of a definitive model , one can compare theoretical models containing an artificial amount of ` enhanced mixing ' with those ( relatively few ) observed binaries , the @xmath351 aur binaries , which have ( a ) a highly evolved ( red or orange supergiant ) component , and ( b ) fundamental data ( masses _ etc .",

    "this fluctuation would be of order 0.007 , if the outer orbit is circular .",
    "such a fluctuation in the eccentricity of a semidetached pair might be expected to have a dramatic effect on the rate of mass transfer , since the pressure scale - height in the atmosphere , relative to the radius , is probably at least ten times smaller .",
    "the absence of such an effect suggests that tidal friction is quite efficient at removing eccentricity ; but too - strong tidal friction could mean that the inner orbit shrinks rapidly compared with a reasonable estimate of its age on the grounds of nuclear evolution . thus we might expect to find both a lower and an upper limit to the dissipation constant @xmath127 from this system .",
    "7 truept,*(iii ) algol * : the well - known triple star algol ( tomkin & lambert 1978 , hill _",
    "et al_.  1971 , labeyrie _",
    "et al_.  1974 , popper 1980 ) has a long - period orbit ( @xmath360y ) which , from vlbi measurements , is inclined at @xmath361 to the orbit of the inner eclipsing pair ( lestrade _ et al_.  1993 ) . in such a highly - inclined system , if the stars are treated as three point masses the inner orbit should cycle in eccentricity between @xmath314 and @xmath362 , on a timescale of @xmath363y , while preserving both inner and outer periods .",
    "it presumably does not do so , and this might partly be because of tidal friction .",
    "however , the quadrupolar distortion of the stars even in the absence of dissipation should lead to apsidal motion in the close pair , which would be quite rapid compared to the apsidal motion driven by the third body .",
    "since the large cycles in eccentricity depend rather critically on the rate of apsidal motion driven by the third star , the extra apsidal motion of the quadrupolar distortion may prevent these cycles from being large ; but we might still expect larger fluctuations on account of the inclination than we would if the orbits were parallel . it is not clear that there is a lower limit to @xmath127 from the ( presumed ) absence of large cycles in eccentricity .",
    "but at the same time tidal friction must not transfer angular momentum from the inner pair to the outer pair so fast that the inner pair would have difficulty in lasting for a nuclear timescale , since the system has in fact existed long enough for considerable nuclear evolution .",
    "thus there may still be an upper limit .",
    "other close triples such as dm per ( hilditch _ et al_.  1986 ) , vv ori ( duerbeck 1975 ) , hd109648 ( jha _ et al_.  1997 ) and @xmath364 crb ( gordon & mulliss 1997 ) , with _ outer _ periods of 100d , 119d , 121d and 250d , may also give upper limits .",
    "7 truept    the first of the above three situations gives a reasonable chance of either confirming or ruling out the equilibrium tide model ; all the initial conditions as well as @xmath127 will have to be treated as free parameters , which might be determined by fitting over a considerable stretch of time .",
    "an analysis of the two triple systems ( @xmath358  tau , @xmath289 per ) is currently being undertaken .",

    "<S> we derive from first principles equations governing ( a ) the quadrupole tensor of a star distorted by both rotation and the presence of a companion in a possibly eccentric orbit , ( b ) a functional form for the dissipative force of tidal friction , based on the concept that the rate of energy loss from a time - dependent tide should be a positive - definite function of the rate of change of the quadrupole tensor as seen in the frame which rotates with the star , and ( c ) the equations governing the rates of change of the magnitude and direction of the stellar rotation , and the orbital period and eccentricity , based on the concept of the laplace - runge - lenz vector . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis leads relatively simply to a closed set of equations , valid for arbitrary inclination of the stellar spin to the orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the results are equivalent to classical results based on the rather less clear principle that the tidal bulge lags behind the line of centres by some time determined by the rate of dissipation ; our analysis gives the effective lag time as a function of the dissipation rate and the quadrupole moment .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss briefly some possible applications of the formulation .    </S>",
