    "measuring long - distance induced decay itself might be helpful to understand the long - distance dynamics in the @xmath39 sector , such as inclusive @xmath40 decay or exclusive @xmath41 and @xmath42 decays related to extracting cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , observation of lnv ( @xmath44 ) decays could be an indication of a majorana nature of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "we have used two sets of open - charm data samples collected by the detector in @xmath45 collisions provided by the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",

    "the detector  @xcite is a general - purpose solenoidal detector equipped with four concentric components : a six - layer vertex drift chamber , a 47-layer main drift chamber , a ring - imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector , and a cesium iodide electromagnetic calorimeter , all operating inside a 1 tesla magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoidal magnet .",
    "the detector provides acceptance of @xmath50% of the full @xmath51 solid angle for both charged particles and photons .",
    "the main drift chamber provides specific - ionization ( @xmath52 ) measurements that discriminate between charged pions and kaons .",
    "the rich detector covers approximately @xmath53% of @xmath51 and provides additional separation of pions and kaons at momentum above @xmath54 mev .",
    "hadron identification efficiencies are approximately @xmath55% with misidentification rates of a few percent  @xcite .",
    "electron identification is based on a likelihood variable that combines the information from the rich detector , @xmath52 , and the ratio of electromagnetic shower energy to track momentum ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "typical electron identification efficiency is well over @xmath57% on average with the pion fake rate less than @xmath58% and the kaon fake rate less than a percent  @xcite .",
    "a geant - based  @xcite monte carlo ( mc ) simulation is used to study efficiencies of signal and background events .",
    "physics events are generated by evtgen  @xcite , tuned with improved knowledge of charm decays , and final - state radiation ( fsr ) is modeled by photos  @xcite .",
    "nonresonant fcnc and lnv signal events are generated according to phase space .",
    "signal candidates are formed from sets of well - measured drift chamber tracks consistent with coming from the nominal interaction point . charged pions and kaons are identified from the tracks with momentum greater than @xmath59 mev and with @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the angle between the track and the beam axis .",
    "electron candidates are required to be above @xmath62 mev with @xmath63 to ensure that @xmath56 is well measured .    at @xmath8 gev , for each signal candidate of the form @xmath24 ( where @xmath3 is either @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) , two kinematic variables are computed to define a signal region : the energy difference @xmath64 and the beam - constrained mass difference @xmath65^{1/2 } - m_{d^+}$ ] , where @xmath66 is the four - momentum of the signal @xmath0 candidate , @xmath67 is the beam energy , and @xmath68 is the nominal  @xcite mass of the @xmath0 meson . to improve the resolution of the kinematic variables , we recover bremsstrahlung photon showers within @xmath69 mrad of the direction of the electron candidates .",
    "we define a signal box for further analysis as @xmath70 , which corresponds to about @xmath71-standard deviations of the kinematic variables .",

    "backgrounds are dominantly from events with real electrons , particularly from @xmath93 semileptonic decays .",
    "the majority of combinatorial background events are from double charm semileptonic decays , typically 4 or less charged particles in the event with large missing energy due to the missing neutrinos .",
    "hadronic decays involving @xmath94-conversion and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 , @xmath35 ) dalitz decay , or accompanied by another charm semileptonic decay , can mimic the @xmath2 signal , as well .",
    "because of the low probability of hadrons being misidentified as electrons  @xcite , background from @xmath47 decays to 3-body charged - particle hadronic decays ( such as @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) are negligible after two electrons are identified , and they do not peak at the signal region due to the wrong mass assignments for the hadrons misidentified as electrons .",
    "that is , @xmath47 backgrounds are predominantly associated with the semileptonic decays and non-@xmath47 ( @xmath101 continuum , @xmath102-pair , radiative return , or qed events ) backgrounds are associated with the @xmath94-conversion and dalitz decays .",
    "all of these backgrounds are nonpeaking or peak away from the signal regions .",
    "our background suppression criteria tuning procedure for @xmath24 channels is detailed in our previous article  @xcite .",
    "we have used the same background rejection criteria with the four kinematic variables to reject the above - mentioned backgrounds in @xmath0 channels and revised the criteria to accommodate the @xmath1 channels .",
    "the other side total energy @xmath103 is the sum of energies of all particles other than those making up the signal candidate .",
    "we use this variable to reject events associated with semileptonic decays , mainly for double charm semileptonic decays , in which the visible other side energy would be small due to the undetectable missing neutrinos .",
    "we reject candidates if @xmath104 gev for @xmath26 , @xmath105 gev for @xmath106 , @xmath107 gev for @xmath87 , and @xmath108 gev for @xmath27 .",
    "for the lnv modes , we reject candidates if the number of tracks in the event is 4 or fewer and @xmath109 gev .",
    "semileptonic events involving @xmath110 in the final state can mimic the signal in @xmath111 channels .",
    "we have used the invariant mass @xmath112 to veto these events .",

    "real electrons from @xmath94-conversion and dalitz decays are suppressed by using the dielectron invariant mass squared @xmath116 computed from the signal electron positron pair , or @xmath117 computed using one signal side electron ( positron ) combined with any oppositely charged unused track .",
    "we veto candidates if @xmath118 or @xmath119 . for @xmath1 ,",
    "we have required the solo photon from @xmath86 decays to @xmath120 to be explicitly reconstructed to further suppress underlying nonstrange - charmed meson backgrounds at @xmath12 gev , by requiring the recoil mass of the signal candidate plus solo photon @xmath121 to be within @xmath122 mev of the nominal  @xcite @xmath80 mass .",
    "regardless of whether the signal @xmath1 candidate is the primary or secondary @xmath1 , for the decay @xmath123 , the mass of the system recoiling against the @xmath1 plus @xmath94 should peak at the @xmath1 mass .",
    "the analysis was done in a blind fashion .",
    "before we opened the signal box , all above - mentioned criteria were optimized using mc events with a sensitivity variable which is defined as the average upper limit one would get from an ensemble of experiments with the expected background and no signal , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the expected number of background events , @xmath126 is the observed number of events , @xmath127 is the 90% confidence coefficient upper limit on the signal , @xmath128 is the poisson probability , @xmath129 is the number of @xmath0 or @xmath1 , and @xmath130 is the signal efficiency .",
