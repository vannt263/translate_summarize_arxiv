    "the term takes the form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the density , temperature , specific entropy , and initial specific entropy respectively , and @xmath8 is the timescale at which this entropy term forces the star back to its initially barotropic structure . in our models",

[ eq1 ] is not included for the @xmath1 stars , the decay of the magnetic energy is much slower .",
    "this is due to the fact that the structure of these models obtain a slight gradient in their specific entropy profiles and thus a small amount of stratification , which act to slow the decay of the magnetic field slightly .    , which are 0.13 , 0.52 , and 5.2 @xmath9 for the black dashed - dotted , the red dotted and teal dashed - dotted curves respectively as well as the blue dashed curve which does not include the entropy forcing term .",

    "we note that the finite time scale @xmath8 can in fact represent an astrophysically relevant time scale . in entropy - stratified fluids such as the radiative regions of main - sequence stars and white dwarfs ,",
    "a magnetic flux tube in mechanical equilibrium will have a lower specific entropy than the surrounding gas , but this entropy difference will be slowly erased by heat conduction . in the compositionally stratified neutron star cores , such a flux tube will have a higher fraction of charged particles ( relative to neutrons ) than its surroundings , but this composition difference can be erased by beta decays or ambipolar diffusion ( ( * ? ? ?",
