    "since the first kuiper belt object ( not including pluto ) was discovered in 1992 @xcite , more than 1000 trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) have been found .",
    "a picture is emerging of the principal characteristics of the tnos that is rich in information but leaves many unanswered questions .",
    "for example , a number of dynamical groups have been identified : classical , resonant , scattered disk @xcite , and more recently the extended scattered disk @xcite . what is the number and size distribution of the smaller objects of these dynamical groups ? is there an extension of the kuiper belt beyond 50 au comprising bodies too small to have been detected in direct surveys ?",
    "meanwhile , could a possible close stellar encounter in the early history of the solar system @xcite be responsible for the mass deficit and the depletion of larger objects ( d @xmath7 150  km ) beyond 50  au ?",
    "the size distribution of these small tnos provides important clues to the dynamical evolution of the early solar system .",
    "kilometer - size tnos with 4% albedo are expected to have @xmath8 , which is still way below the detection limit of the largest ground - based telescopes .",
    "yet the vast majority of the tno population is beyond the limit of direct observation for example , the keck pencil beam survey @xcite has a detection limit of @xmath9 .",
    "a number of authors @xcite have suggested the possibility of detecting tnos by stellar occultation .",
    "an occultation manifests itself as the shadow created by a tno occulting a background star sweeping across the earth , causing flux reduction in the lightcurve .",
    "hence , as opposed to direct observation , stellar occultation by tnos provides a unique way of detecting kilometer to sub - kilometer size objects in the foreseeable future .",
    "recently a few groups have attempted to search for occultations by tnos @xcite , but no real detection has been confirmed yet .",
    "projects committed to search for tnos by occultation either do not have adequate time resolution , observe too few stars with good snr or do not have enough observing time .",
    "these projects do a blind search for occultations , and these events are rare due to the reasons mentioned above .",
    "therefore , the key to a successful detection is to have high sampling ( @xmath10  20  hz ) , high signal to noise ratio of background stars ( snr @xmath10 80 ) , small stellar angular sizes ( @xmath11 0.1  mas ) and , most importantly , many star - hours of observations ( @xmath7 a few hundred thousands ) .",
    "the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) is a project consisting of 4 telescopes that can cover over 6000 @xmath0 per night or scan the whole visible sky from hawaii ( @xmath12 ) in a week to a detecting limit @xmath13 magnitude .",
    "pan - starrs prototype telescope ( ps1 ) will monitor up to 60 guide stars in a very high sampling rate video mode .",
    "we have compiled a list which allows us to select guide stars from anywhere in the field ; guide stars could be in any of the 64@xmath1464 otccds ( see @xmath15[sec : ps1 ] ) and read at @xmath16  hz .",
    "each field will have multiple choices of guide stars that were ranked based on the predicted event rates , which depend on their snrs and angular sizes . by properly selecting guide stars",
    ", the pan - starrs video mode images would be ideal for searching tnos .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the pan - starrs system . in @xmath15[sec : diff ] and @xmath15[sec : det ] we discuss the diffraction profiles and present our detection algorithm . in @xmath15 [",
    "sec : angular ] we describe the prediction of stellar angular size using @xmath2 color . in @xmath15[sec : rate ] we estimate the number of expected events based on different number density estimations , sampling rates and stellar angular sizes .",
    "the methodology and compilation of the guide star list is in @xmath15[sec : catalog ] . in @xmath15[sec : engdata ] , we show and describe the quality of the engineering data obtained in fall 2008 .",
    "conclusions are in the final section .",
    "the full version of pan - starrs will contain four identical telescopes and camera systems , which is also known as pan - starrs-4 @xcite .",
    "ps1 is a single telescope and camera system built to test all requirements that are needed in the full version project .",
    "ps1 telescope has an aperture of 1.8  m in diameter with 3-element wide field corrector that delivers a 7 deg@xmath17 flat field in the focal plane .",
    "its 8  m focal length gives a plate scale of 38.5 @xmath18m / arcsecond rendering a pixel resolution of 0.258 arcsecond / pixel .",
    "the telescope can monitor up to 240 guide stars at @xmath16  hz ( in reality , probably about 60 guide stars at 30hz with high snr ) .",
    "high frequency image motion can be removed by on - chip fast guiding , where localized image motion can be calculated from a collection of nearby guide stars . hence different image motions across the field of view can be corrected .",
    "this can only be achieved with the innovative design of an orthogonal transfer charge coupled device ( otccd ) .",
    "the otccd allows on - chip charge shifting , in both rows and columns , which can compensate for the image motion in the focal plane @xcite .",
    "the ps1 giga - pixel camera ( gpc1 ) contains an 8x8 array , minus the 4 corners , of otccds . for reasons of economy of manufacture , facilitating fast readout and other practical concerns , the otccds each consist of an 8x8 orthogonal transfer array ( ota ) of independently - addressable cells of size 590x598 pixels .",
    "hence gpc1 comprises approximately 1.4 billion pixels .",
    "typically , each ota will have a single cell devoted to a guide star reading at high frequency . of the 590x598 pixels of this cell",
    ", only a small fraction around the guide star will be read , thus allowing a fast read out with relatively low read noise .",
    ".filter bandpass , @xmath19 ( the ab magnitude that produces @xmath20/sec / pixel ) and average sky brightness @xmath18 in magnitudes per arcsecond at haleakala for ps1 filters .",

    "we have made a pre - survey study of using lightcurves from guide star video mode images to search for occultation by tnos near 43  au .",
    "simulations were made to calculate the null hypothesis distribution ( ) and detection efficiency for various angular sizes and snrs . under 30  hz sampling",
    ", ps1 can detect objects as small as @xmath21 m at 43  au ( ) .",
    "using @xmath2 indices , we predicted the angular sizes of all matched stars between tycho2 and 2mass catalogs with @xmath22 mag and @xmath23 mag above the ps1 southern declination limit @xmath24 .",
    "the distribution of stellar angular sizes peak around 0.02  mas in ps1 @xmath12 sky ( ) . on average , there are about 180 stars with @xmath25 mag for ps1 7 deg@xmath17 field of view .",
    "given that we can choose only 60 guide stars for each ps1 target field , we ranked our guide star candidates by their number of expected events based on their angular sizes , snrs and model by p&s05 .",
    "as mentioned before , multiple choices of guide star will ensure us the freedom of selecting guide stars away from gaps in the ccd array or dead pixels that would develop over time .",
    "based on the differential size distribution from different models and the threshold to have one false positive in the ps1 three - year lifetime , we estimated the number of expected events could be somewhere from 1 to @xmath26 ( ) .",
    "the engineering data allowed us to investigate the quality of the lightcurve and develop the detection pipeline for the upcoming real data .",
    "we have established that the detection technique performs as well with the filtered engineering data .",
    "we also realize that the true snr is limited by systematics .",
    "some of the systematics will be removed as we move to real data stream , however some of the systematics will remain . for example , scintillation will limit the snr to about 200 .",
    "we have recalculated the event rates with the worst case scenario and found that the event rates were compromised by a factor of four .",
    "even with this pessimistic estimation the event rate that ps1 will find can allow us to place a constraint on the size distribution and hence the evolution of the tnos .",
    "using the available engineering data and detection efficiency at 0.4 and 0.5  km , we were able to derive an effective solid angle @xmath27 and @xmath28 deg@xmath17 and set the 95% confidence upper limit on surface number density at @xmath29 and @xmath30 deg@xmath6 ( ) . in future work , for the upcoming real data , we will set the threshold based on maximum true positive to false positive ratio , which allows more candidate events for further investigations .",
    "meanwhile , the video mode lightcurves can also be used to search for objects in sedna like orbits from 100 to 1000  au .",
    "we will work on a new detection algorithm that is capable of searching for objects in this region .",
