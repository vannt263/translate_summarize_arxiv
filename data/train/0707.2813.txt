    "we consider a model of interacting particle systems , which is a generalization of the tasep ( totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ) and the toom model .",
    "besides the extension of some universality results to a new model , the main feature of this paper is the extension of the range of analysis to any `` space - like '' paths in space - time , whose extreme cases are fixed time and fixed particle ( tagged particle problem ) , see below for details .",
    "consider the system of @xmath2 particles @xmath3 in @xmath4 that undergoes the following continuous time markovian evolution : each particle has two exponential clocks ",
    "one is responsible for its jumps to the left while the other one is responsible for its jumps to the right .",
    "all @xmath5 clocks are independent , and the rates of all left clocks are equal to @xmath6 while the rates of all right clocks are equal to @xmath7 . when the @xmath8th left clock rings , the @xmath8th particle jumps to the nearest vacant site on its left .",
    "when the @xmath8th right clock rings , the @xmath8th particle jumps to the right by one provided that the site @xmath9 is empty ; otherwise it stays put .",
    "the main goal of the paper is to study the asymptotic properties of this system when the number of particles and the evolution time become large .",
    "if @xmath10 then the dynamics is known under the name of totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) , and if @xmath11 the dynamics is a special case of toom s model studied in  @xcite ( see references therein too ) .",
    "both systems belong to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class of growth models in @xmath12 dimensions .",
    "particle s jump to the nearest vacant spot on its left can be also viewed as the particle pushing all its left neighbors by one if they prevent it from jumping to the left .",
    "this point of view is often beneficial because it remains meaningful for infinite systems , and also the order of particles is not being changed . because of this pushing effect we call our system the pushing asymmetric simple exclusion process or pushasep .",
    "observe that for a @xmath2-particle pushasep with particles , the evolution of @xmath13 for any @xmath14 is the @xmath15-particle pushasep not influenced by the presence of the remaining @xmath16 particles .",
    "this `` triangularity property '' seems to be a key feature of our model that allows our analysis to go through .",
    "our results split in two groups  algebraic and analytic .",
    "algebraically , we derive a determinantal formula for the distribution of the @xmath2-particle pushasep with an arbitrary fixed initial condition , and we also represent this distribution as a gap probability for a ( possibly , signed ) determinantal point process ( see  @xcite for information on determinantal processes ) .",
    "the result is obtained in greater generality with jump rates @xmath6 and @xmath7 being both time and particle - dependent ( proposition  [ proppushasep ] ) .",
    "the first part ( the determinantal formula , see proposition  [ prop1 ] ) is a generalization of similar results due to @xcite obtained by the bethe ansatz techniques .",
    "also , a closely related result have been obtained very recently in  @xcite using a version of the robinson - schensted - knuth correspondence .",
    "analytically , we use the above - mentioned determinantal process to study the large time behavior of the infinite - particle pushasep with two initial conditions : + 1 .",
    "flat initial condition with particles occupying all even integers .",
    "step initial condition with particles occupying all negative integers . + it is not obvious that the infinite - particle pushasep started from these initial configurations is correctly defined , and some work needs to be done to prove the existence of the markovian dynamics . however , we take a simpler path here and consider our infinite - particle system as a limit of growing finite - particle systems .",
    "it turns out that for the above initial conditions , the distribution of any finite number of particles at any finitely many time moments stabilizes as the total number of particles in the system becomes large enough .",
    "it is this limiting distribution that we analyze .",
    "we are able to control the asymptotic behavior of the joint distribution of @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is the second main novel feature of the present paper ( the first one being the model itself ) that we can handle joint distributions of different particles at different time moments . as special cases we find distributions of several particles at a given time moment and distribution of one particle at several time moments ( a.k.a . the tagged particle ) .    in the growth model formulation of pushasep",
    "( that we do not give here ; it can be easily reconstructed from the growth models for tasep and toom s model described in @xcite and references therein ) , this corresponds to joint distributions of values of the height function at a finite number of space - time points that lie on a space - like path ; for that reason we use the term ` space - like path ' below .",
    "the two extreme space - like paths were described above ",
    "they correspond to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the algebraic techniques of handling space - like paths are used in the subsequent paper  @xcite to analyze two different models , namely the polynuclear growth ( png ) model on a flat substrate and tasep in discrete time with parallel update .",
    "our main result states that large time fluctuations of the particle positions along any space - like path have exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and that the limiting process is the airy@xmath0 process for the flat initial condition and the airy@xmath1 process for the step initial condition ( see the review  @xcite and section  [ sectlimitprocesses ] below for the definition of these processes ) .    in the pushasep model",
    ", we have the fluctuation exponent @xmath22 even in the case of zero drift .",
    "this is due to the asymmetry in the dynamical rules and it is consistent with the kpz hypothesis .",
    "in fact , from kpz we expect to have the @xmath22 exponent when @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the current of particles as a function of their density @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for pushasep .",
    "we find it remarkable that up to scaling factors , the fluctuations are independent of the space - like path we choose ( this phenomenon was also observed in @xcite for the polynuclear growth model ( png ) with step initial condition ) .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that this type of universality holds at least as broadly as kpz - universality does .    interestingly",
    "enough , so far it is unknown how to study the joint distribution of @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( two points on a time - like path ) ; this question remains a major open problem of the subject .",
    "_ previous results .",
    "_ for the tasep and png models , large time fluctuation results have already been obtained in the following cases : for the step initial condition the airy@xmath1 process has been shown to occur in the scaling limit for fixed time  @xcite , and more recently for tagged particle  @xcite . for tasep , the airy@xmath0 process occurs for flat initial conditions in continuous time  @xcite and in discrete time with sequential update  @xcite with generalization to the initial condition of one particle every @xmath32 sites .",
    "also , a transition between the airy@xmath1 and airy@xmath0 processes was obtained in  @xcite .",
    "these are fixed time results ; the only previous result concerning general space - like paths is to be found in  @xcite in the context of the png model , where the airy@xmath1 process was obtained as a limit for a directed percolation model .    _",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sectmodel ]",
    "we describe the model and the results . in proposition  [ prop1 ]",
    "the transition probability of the model is given .",

    "we first prove proposition  [ prop1 ] and then obtain the general kernel for a determinantal measure of a certain form ( theorem  [ thmkernel ] ) , which includes the one of pushasep . finally , the asymptotic analysis is the content of section  [ sectasympt ] .",

    "the model we consider is an extension of the well known totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) on @xmath33 .",
    "the allowed configuration are like in the tasep , i.e. , configurations consist of particles on @xmath33 , with the constraint that at each site can be occupied by at most one particle ( exclusion constraint ) .",
    "we consider a dynamics in continuous time , where particles are allowed to jump to the right and to the left as follows",
    ". a particle jumps to its right - neighbor site with some rate , provided the site is empty ( tasep dynamics ) . to the left , a particle jump to its left - neighbor site with some rate and ,",
    "if the site is already occupied by another particle , this is pushed to its left - neighbor and so on ( push dynamics ) .    to define precisely the jump rates , we need to introduce a few notations .",
    "since the dynamics preserves the relative order of particles , we can associate to each particle a label .",
    "let @xmath34 be the position of particle @xmath35 at time @xmath36 .",
    "we choose the right - left labeling , i.e. , @xmath37 for all @xmath38 , @xmath39 . with this labeling , we consider @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and some smooth positive increasing functions @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
