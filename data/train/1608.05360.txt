    "phase coherence is of critical importance for quantum information processing . in solid state devices",
    "one can _ a priori _ envision many different sources of decoherence and it is important to find systems where quantum information can be protected from decoherence .",
    "an extensive literature has been accumulated on superconducting technologies over several decades , and after the year 1999 , superconducting qubits have emerged as promising candidates , e.g. , for quantum computing and quantum simulation since they should allow for scalability and integration to larger circuits .",
    "a popular early design of a superconducting qubit was based on a cooper - pair box @xcite , but it was very susceptible to charge noise , a decoherence mechanism that turned out to be extremely difficult to eliminate . reengineering the design in a modified cooper - pair box , a transmon qubit @xcite , it was , nevertheless , possible to circumvent the problem and considerably enhance the coherence times @xcite .    in the state - of - the - art transmon qubits ,",
    "experiments have provided considerably specific information on the origins of decoherence .",
    "a body of experimental evidence suggests that a leading decoherence mechanism is due to a sparse bath of spurious incoherent two - level systems ( tlss ) coupled to a qubit .",
    "first , measuring power dependence of the microwave loss has revealed dielectric loss from tlss in insulating materials @xcite .",
    "second , coupling to tlss can explain the frequency dependence of the loss observed in transmons @xcite .",
    "such studies can identify the number of tlss on a given frequency interval and show that the distribution of tlss is sufficiently sparse to clearly distinguish individual tlss @xcite .",
    "third , whereas the qubits with a larger junction area , e.g. , phase qubits , often couple to tlss where an excitation may coherently oscillate between the qubit and a tls @xcite , such coherent tlss are rare in transmons where the junctions are smaller . instead , in transmons ,",
    "spectroscopic studies indicate that most tlss interact incoherently with the qubit and have a large decay rate as compared to the qubit - tls coupling @xcite .",
    "in superconducting coplanar resonators , detailed studies of various design geometries and materials , as well as theoretical considerations of distributions of electric fields and participation ratios , have identified metal - substrate and substrate - air interfaces as the dominant sources of loss @xcite . moreover , in xmon qubits that represent a version of a transmon , experiments have shown that the lower and upper bounds of the qubit relaxation time @xmath0 depend on the dimensions of the qubit capacitor which indicates that the incoherent tlss reside in the capacitor @xcite .    for tlss ,",
    "originating from tunneling of charged atomic configurations between two lattice positions in amorphous materials , theory was developed already in 1970 s by anderson , halperin , phillips , and varma @xcite .",
    "but while it is well established that superconducing qubits generally couple to tlss of some sort , their exact microscopic origin is still uncertain , and it is important to gather information on different aspects @xcite of individual tlss .",
    "it is therefore useful to be able to efficiently characterize them . knowing the tls frequencies precisely also helps to avoid them in controlling the qubit frequency .",
    "characterization of quantum systems often assumes that the form of the model is known and only its parameters are uncertain .",
    "however , there may also exist significant uncertainty even on the form of the model , i.e. , on the number of parameters to be estimated .",
    "this is the case , for instance , when a qubit is coupled to tlss whose number is initially unknown .",
    "partial information on such a system may be obtained by model selection @xcite , e.g. , through akaike information @xcite or bayesian information criterion @xcite . however",
    ", bayesian inference @xcite also provides a unified framework where model selection and parameter estimation may be solved simultaneously and become parts of the same question .",
    "this fact is built in , e.g. , in the recently introduced technique of model averaging @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "random , independently on data chosen , measurements were used for state estimation . while data - independent random controls are more easily realized experimentally and form , e.g. , the basis of techniques such as randomized benchmarking @xcite , it has been shown theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite that in many situations adapting measurement settings during data collection can significantly speed up characterization .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce simultaneous adaptive model selection and parameter estimation . for adaptive measurements ,",
    "the main task is to assign a set of rules , also called a policy , according to which the measurement settings can be chosen efficiently based on the data obtained .",
    "for concreteness , we present such a policy for characterization of a qubit and an initially unknown number of tlss coupled to it . in the bayesian framework , information on the previous measurements is , rather than revisiting all the previous data , encoded in the current bayesian posterior probability distribution which can then for adaptive measurements be used for choosing the measurement settings efficiently .",
    "the sequential monte carlo ( smc ) method @xcite has recently gained popularity in the quantum context @xcite due to its computational efficiency .",
    "but as we explain below , the existing formulation of smc does not work when the model is initially unknown .",
    "we generalize smc to account simultaneously both for model selection and parameter estimation .",
    "our approach is not limited to a particular physical system but may be used for a larger class of problems .    .",
    "the color scale for the swap spectrum represents the qubit excited state probability .",
    "the filled circles illustrate a simulated sequence of adaptive measurement settings in the frequency  waiting time plane .",

    "time resolved spectrosopy , referred as swap spectroscopy , where an excitation may oscillate between the qubit and another quantum system was pioneered in @xcite for identification of coherent tlss coupled to a phase qubit .",
    "it has become a commonly used method for quantifying a coherent qubit - qubit coupling @xcite and has been applied for further characterization of coherent tlss , e.g. , in @xcite , and for incoherent tlss in @xcite .",
    "thus even when an excitation can not coherently oscillate between the qubit and the tls , we follow the standard terminology and still refer to this technique as swap spectroscopy .",
    "the understanding of swap spectroscopy may be facilitated by a graphical illustration , see fig .",
    "[ fig : swap ] for a simulated swap spectrum of two incoherent tlss .",
    "one starts by preparing the qubit in the excited state such that the tlss are in their ground state .",
    "this can be done by setting @xmath7 far from any @xmath9 and then exciting the qubit with a microwave pulse .",

    "the system is then reset to its ground state before the next measurement .",
    "the measurement is repeated at the same setting many , usually thousands of times , to approximate the qubit excited state probability .    for coherent tlss ,",
    "chevron patterns in the swap spectrum can be used to identify the tls frequency and the strength of its coupling with the qubit @xcite .",
    "the conventional technique of doing this ( for a detailed explanation , see , e.g. @xcite ) is based on first finding the tls frequency @xmath24 and then deducing the coupling strength that is proportional to the frequency of coherent oscillations that the excitation undergoes between the qubit and the tls .",
    "this conventional method does not require bayesian inference but it is not equally efficient or precise than more sophisticated bayesian schemes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , reviewing the former technique shows that it does not work for incoherent tlss because an excitation can not coherently oscillate between the qubit and the tls . instead , a more general approach based on bayesian inference can still be applied .",
    "a common experimental practice to make crude tests on the presence of tlss is to first scan qubit frequencies for possible signatures of a coherent coupling to another system , and if such signatures are find at a certain @xmath7 , carry out more measurements at different @xmath22 at such @xmath7 . our policy ( cf .",
    "[ sec : adpol ] ) works somewhat similarly , but since it is built on an adaptive bayesian scheme it is more systematic , precise , and efficient , which becomes increasingly useful with more complex or uncertain models .",

    "resampling is an element of the smc scheme but does not constitute the whole algorithm ; for the complete presentation of the algorithm , we refer to @xcite .",
    "resampling imposes on the particles artificial dynamics whose purpose is to `` smoothen '' the discrete representation of the probability distribution @xmath76 and to collect the particles in the regions where the probability density is the highest , thus mitigating a limitation in accuracy that a fixed grid would cause . by construction , the artificial dynamics",

    "the purpose of the second step is to `` compress '' the probability distribution to counteract the third step that increases the covariances . finally , in step ( iii )",

    "( [ eq : sigmadef ] ) is to ensure that the covariances are conserved in resampling .    in our example",
    ", we model a sample with two defects ( @xmath91 ) by a vector of the form @xmath92 .",

    "( [ eq : shift ] ) would generally move @xmath102 to @xmath106 .",
    "this is clearly an incorrect outcome since the steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) are merely an unphysical computational procedure .",
    "they should not generally immediately change @xmath4 to its maximum value for all the particles , but this is what would happen if the standard formulation of smc would be applied without any modifications .",

    "but if the smc algorithm is modified this way , the rest of the scheme has to be modified too , in order to conserve the covariances of the probability distribution .",
    "we find that covariances may be conserved by modifying resampling as follows , treating probability distributions for different numbers of particles separately . in step ( i ) of the resampling , we pick randomly @xmath111 as in the standard scheme . as explained above , @xmath112 with exactly one @xmath113 such that we may denote @xmath114 . in step ( ii )",

    "we have generalized the concept of adaptive measurements to account for simultaneous model selection and parameter estimation .",
    "we implemented a policy built on an adaptive bayesian scheme using a generalization of sequential monte carlo method . since global optimization through utility @xcite maximization would generally be numerically challenging , many recent works making use of bayesian inference have adopted either greedy algorithms @xcite that optimize a certain utility function assuming the next measurement is the last one , or different heuristics that choose measurement settings adaptively through a probability distribution @xcite .",
    "our work belongs to the latter category .    assuming the model is known and that only its parameter values are uncertain",
    ", it should be noted that the difficulty of parameter estimation depends on the model . in certain cases",
    "it is possible to drastically outperform nonadaptive measurements and , e.g. , to improve the accuracy of the estimate exponentially as a function of the number of measurement shots @xcite .",
    "basically , this is because in the systems considered in @xcite , small changes in the coupling strength may correspond to a large change in the observable @xmath144 when @xmath22 is long .",
    "however , in the system studied within this paper ( with the parameters in the region discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : iprior ] ) , long @xmath22 leads to loss of the signal due to rapid relaxation of the qubit which is why small changes in @xmath12 and @xmath145 always correspond to small differences in @xmath144 . hence inferring @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath145 is difficult .",

    "furthermore , since the volume of the parameter space increases exponentially with its dimension , this makes the set of particles sparser .",
    "this `` curse of dimensionality '' decreases the effective sample size @xmath146 , making it smaller than , e.g. , in the considerations of @xcite , which may increase the numerical error .",
    "we attribute the observed floors in accuracy in figs .",
    "[ fig : defects2 ] and [ fig : defects01 ] to competition between information obtained through measurements and accumulated numerical error . despite these challenges ,",

    "we emphasize that @xmath9 are the quantities that are the most relevant , e.g. , to protect a qubit from unwanted decoherence since avoiding parking the qubit at these frequencies makes its coherence time longer .",
    "even though in this paper we have considered characterization of incoherent tlss as an example , the idea of simultaneous adaptive model selection and parameter estimation is applicable to a larger class of problems .",
    "for instance , once the required likelihood functions have been derived , it is straightforward to generalize the work in @xcite for an unknown number of coherent tlss .    in conclusion , assuming both the model and all its parameters are initially uncertain , we formulated system characterizion in a unified bayesian framework and delivered numerical tools required for solving a concrete problem .",
