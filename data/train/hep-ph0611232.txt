    "one of the most appealing mechanisms to generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) , @xmath5  @xcite , is that of baryogenesis via leptogenesis .",
    "thermal leptogenesis is an attractive and minimal mechanism , in which a lepton asymmetry is dynamically generated , and then converted into a baryon asymmetry due to @xmath6-violating sphaleron interactions  @xcite .",
    "the latter exist both in the standard model ( sm ) and in its minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) extension , the mssm .",
    "the seesaw mechanism  @xcite provides an elegant explanation for the observed smallness of the neutrino masses and , in addition , it offers the possibility of leptogenesis  @xcite . in this case , the lepton asymmetry is generated by the out - of - equilibrium decays of the same heavy right - handed neutrinos which are responsible for the suppression of the light neutrino masses . in spite of being one of the most simple frameworks where thermal leptogenesis can be realised",
    ", the seesaw mechanism introduces a large number of new parameters ( in both its sm and mssm versions ) .",
    "although an important amount of data has already been collected , many of the seesaw parameters , namely those associated with the right - handed neutrino sector , are experimentally unreachable . as discussed by many authors ,",
    "strong constraints on the seesaw parameter space can be imposed from the requirement of successful thermal leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "typically , all these studies relied on the so - called flavour - independent ( or one - flavour ) approximation to thermal leptogenesis . in the latter approximation , the baryon asymmetry is calculated by solving a boltzmann equation for the abundance of the lightest right - handed neutrino , and for the total lepton asymmetry .",
    "additionally , in the flavour - independent approximation , the only relevant cp violation sources are those associated with the right - handed neutrino sector ( more concretely , the complex @xmath7-matrix angles , when working in the so - called casas - ibarra parameterisation  @xcite ) .    in recent years , the impact of flavour in thermal leptogenesis has merited increasing attention  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in fact , the one - flavour approximation is only rigorously correct when the interactions mediated by the charged lepton yukawa couplings are out of equilibrium . below a given temperature ( e.g. @xmath8 in the sm )",
    ", the tau yukawa coupling comes into equilibrium ( later followed by the couplings of the muon and electron ) .",
    "flavour effects are then physical and become manifest , not only at the level of the generated cp asymmetries , but also regarding the washout processes that destroy the asymmetries created for each flavour . in the full computation ,",
    "the asymmetries in each distinguishable flavour are differently washed out , and appear with distinct weights in the final baryon asymmetry .",
    "flavour - dependent leptogenesis has recently been addressed in detail by several authors  @xcite-@xcite . in particular ,",
    "flavour - dependent effects in leptogenesis have been studied , and shown to be relevant , in the two right - handed neutrino models  @xcite as well as in classes of neutrino mass models with three right - handed neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the quantum oscillations / correlations of the asymmetries in lepton flavour space have been included in ref .",
    "@xcite and the treatment has also been generalised to the mssm  @xcite .",
    "one interesting implication of the flavour - dependent treatment is that in addition to the right - handed sector cp violating phases ( that is , a complex @xmath7-matrix ) , low - energy cp violating sources , associated with the light neutrino sector , also play a relevant role . even in the absence of cp violation from the right - handed neutrino sector",
    "( which would lead to a zero baryon asymmetry in the one - flavour approximation ) , a non - vanishing baryon asymmetry can in principle be generated from the cp phases in the maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix , @xmath1 .",
    "strong connections between the low - energy cp phases of the @xmath1 matrix and cp violation for flavour - dependent leptogenesis can either emerge in classes of neutrino mass models  @xcite or under the hypothesis of no cp violation sources associated with the right - handed neutrino sector ( real @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the latter limit , bounds on the masses of the light and heavy neutrinos and on the flavour - dependent decay asymmetries have been derived  @xcite .",
    "the correlation of the baryon asymmetry with the effective majorana mass in neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath9 ) decays has also been addressed  @xcite .",
    "another appealing aspect of the flavour - dependent treatment is that at least one of the cp sources , the dirac cp - violating phase , is likely to be experimentally measured ( one of the majorana phases could also in principle be measured - even though this represents a considerable challenge  @xcite , while the right - handed phases are experimentally unaccessible ) .    in the supersymmetric implementation of the seesaw mechanism , further constraints on the seesaw parameter space can arise",
    "these are particularly relevant in models of local susy ( i.e. supergravity ) .",
    "first , one should consider cosmological bounds on the reheat temperature ( @xmath10 ) after inflation , associated with the thermal production of gravitinos .",
    "@xmath10 has generally a strong impact on thermal leptogenesis , since the production of right - handed neutrinos is suppressed if their mass largely exceeds @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , due these bounds on the reheat temperature , viable thermal leptogenesis will impose strong constraints on the seesaw parameter space of locally supersymmetric models .",
    "secondly , additional bounds on the susy seesaw parameter space arise from low - energy observables , namely lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) muon and tau decays such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , and charged lepton electric dipole moments . in studies of lfv ,",
    "thermal leptogenesis in the flavour - independent approximation has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and reheating effects have been explicitly included in ref .",
    "@xcite . with a potential future observation of the sparticle spectrum",
    ", the combined constraints on the susy seesaw parameters from leptogenesis and lfv could lead to interesting information on the heavy neutrino sector , which is otherwise unobservable at accelerators .    in this study ,",
    "our aim is to investigate the constraints on the parameters of the type - i susy seesaw mechanism from the requirement of a successful flavour - dependent thermal leptogenesis in the presence of upper bounds on the reheat temperature of the early universe .",
    "previous studies of flavour - dependent thermal leptogenesis were conducted in the sm , and for a mass range of the lightest right - handed neutrino where only the tau - flavour is in thermal equilibrium . in the present analysis",
    ", we will work in the context of the mssm extended by three right - handed neutrino superfields .",
    "moreover , for the temperatures we will consider , both tau- and muon - flavours are in thermal equilibrium , so that in fact all leptonic flavours must be treated separately .",
    "we update the boltzmann equations of ref .",
    "@xcite to include flavour effects , and point out which regions of the seesaw parameter space generically enable optimal efficiency and/or optimal decay asymmetries for leptogenesis ( focusing on the case of hierarchical light and heavy neutrino masses ) .",
    "we then discuss the differences between the flavour - independent approximation and the correct flavour - dependent treatment .",
    "we encounter interesting new regions of the seesaw parameter space , which are now viable due to flavour - dependent effects . on the other hand , and as we will discuss throughout this work , scenarios of leptogenesis solely arising from the @xmath14 phases are quite difficult to accommodate , and become increasingly disfavoured when stronger bounds on @xmath10 are taken into account .    in the presence of strict bounds on @xmath10 , whether or not it is possible to generate the observed baryon asymmetry exclusively from low - energy dirac and/or majorana phases is still a question that deserves careful consideration .",
    "likewise , it is worth considering to which extent right - handed sector phases ( other than those of the @xmath1 ) could affect a potentially viable scenario of low - energy cp violating leptogenesis , and vice - versa .",
    "our work is organised as follows . in section  [ model :",
    "susyseesaw ] , we briefly summarise the most relevant aspects of the type - i susy seesaw mechanism .",
    "section  [ sec : fml ] is devoted to the discussion of thermal leptogenesis with reheating .",
    "in addition to estimating the baryon asymmetry , we focus on the constraints on the reheat temperature arising from the gravitino problem . a short summary of the limitations and approximations of our computation is also included . in section  [ sec : constraints ] , we finally discuss the constraints on the seesaw parameters obtained from the requirement of successful leptogenesis , namely constraints on the neutrino masses and on the @xmath7-matrix mixing angles .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ concl ] .",
    "in what follows , we briefly introduce the most relevant features of neutrino mass generation via the seesaw mechanism . in the mssm extended by three right - handed neutrino superfields , the relevant terms in the superpotential to describe a type - i susy seesaw are @xmath15 in the above",

    ", we will assume that we are in a basis where @xmath22 and @xmath20 are diagonal .",
    "after electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking , the charged lepton and dirac neutrino mass matrices can be explicitly written as @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the neutral higgs scalars , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 gev .",
    "the @xmath28 neutrino mass matrix , whose eigenvalues are the masses of the six majorana neutrinos , is given by @xmath29 in the seesaw limit , @xmath30 , one obtains three light and three heavy states , @xmath31 and @xmath17 , respectively .",

    "( [ seesaw : def ] ) , leads ( at lowest order in the @xmath32 expansion ) to the standard seesaw equation for the light neutrino mass matrix , @xmath33 and to @xmath34 .",
    "since we are working in a basis where @xmath20 is diagonal , the heavy eigenstates are then given by @xmath35 the matrix @xmath36 can be diagonalised by the unitary matrix @xmath37 , leading to the following masses for the light physical states @xmath38 here we will use the standard parameterisation for the @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 , and where @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",

    "@xmath7 can be parameterised in terms of three complex angles , @xmath50 @xmath51 as @xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "( [ seesaw : casas ] ) is a convenient means of parameterising our ignorance of the full neutrino yukawa couplings , while at the same time allowing to accommodate the experimental data .",
    "notice that it is only valid at the right - handed neutrino scales @xmath20 , so that the quantities appearing in eq .",
    "( [ seesaw : casas ] ) are the renormalised ones , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    in this study",
    ", we shall mainly focus on the simplest scenario , where both heavy and light neutrinos are hierarchical , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and in particular , we will assume a normal ordering of the light neutrinos . thus , the masses @xmath59 can be written in terms of the lightest mass @xmath60 and the solar / atmospheric mass - squared differences as @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "in summary , when working in the @xmath7-matrix parameterisation , the 18 parameters of the seesaw mechanism are accounted by the three heavy neutrinos masses , @xmath63 , the mass of the lightest neutrino @xmath64 plus the two mass squared differences @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the three mixing angles @xmath44 and three cp violating phases @xmath67 of the @xmath37 matrix , and the three complex angles @xmath50 of the matrix @xmath7 . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "many of the latter parameters , namely those associated with the heavy neutrino sector , are experimentally unreachable .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to derive interesting bounds from the requirement of successful thermal leptogenesis , and we proceed to do so in the following sections .",
    "as recently pointed out  @xcite , flavour can have a strong impact in baryogenesis via thermal leptogenesis .",
    "the effects are manifest not only in the flavour - dependent cp asymmetries , but also in the flavour - dependence of scattering processes in the thermal bath , which can destroy a previously produced asymmetry .",
    "in fact , depending on the temperatures at which thermal leptogenesis takes place , and thus on which interactions mediated by the charged lepton yukawa couplings are in thermal equilibrium , flavour - dependent effects can have a strong impact on the estimation of the produced baryon asymmetry  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for example , in the mssm , for temperatures between circa @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the @xmath70 and @xmath71 yukawa couplings are in thermal equilibrium and all flavours in the boltzmann equations are to be treated separately . for instance , for @xmath72 , this applies for temperatures below about @xmath73 gev ( and above @xmath74 ) , a temperature range we will be subsequently considering . moreover , in the full flavour - dependent treatment , lepton asymmetries are generated in each individual lepton flavour .",
    "processes which can wash out these asymmetries are also flavour - dependent , i.e.  the inverse decays from electrons can only destroy the lepton asymmetry in the electron flavour",
    ". we will address the latter issues in section  [ bau:1 ] .    in thermal leptogenesis",
    ", the population of right - handed neutrinos @xmath75 is produced from scattering processes in the thermal bath . to generate the observed baryon asymmetry comparatively high temperatures of the early universe are required , and these should not lie much below the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino , @xmath76 . even under optimal conditions , thermal leptogenesis demands @xmath77 gev ( for hierarchical light and heavy neutrinos )  @xcite .",
    "high temperatures compatible with thermal leptogenesis can arise in the process of reheating which takes place after cosmic inflation  @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the universe at the end of reheating is referred to as the reheat temperature @xmath0 .",

    "in particular , we assume that the lightest right - handed ( s)neutrinos are only produced by thermal scatterings during and after reheating",

    "accordingly , we also use the equilibrium number densities in this so - called boltzmann approximation .",
    "all the above mentioned approximations ( as well as others we have not explicitly discussed ) will ultimately translate in potentially relevant theoretical uncertainties when estimating the value of the bau .",

    "the predictions for the baryon asymmetry arising from a given seesaw scenario can be severely compromised due to constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "one important example of such constraints emerges in locally supersymmetric theories , and stems from the decays of thermally produced gravitinos  @xcite . in this class of susy models , and assuming a low - energy mssm with r - parity conservation , either the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and is thus stable , or else it will ultimately decay into the lsp .",
    "two generic problems arise from these decays , and are the following .",
    "firstly , gravitinos can decay late , after the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) epoch , and potentially spoil the success of bbn  @xcite .",

    "for gravitino masses in the tev region , the gravitino bbn problem practically precludes the possibility of thermal leptogenesis .",
    "however , with a heavy gravitino ( roughly above @xmath133 tev ) , the bbn problems can be nearly avoided .",

    "large imaginary parts of @xmath234 typically lead to @xmath240 , and thus are not useful in achieving optimal efficiencies .",
    "although it is straightforward to generalise the discussion to include arbitrary @xmath234 , we will simplify the analysis by setting @xmath241 in what follows . in the limit of @xmath241",

    "( [ eq : mt_2 ] , [ eq : mt_3 ] ) , only the zeroth order terms in an expansion in @xmath162 are shown for @xmath243 .",
    "in general , for an optimal efficiency , it is crucial to avoid contributions to @xmath108 of order @xmath244 or @xmath239 . in the flavour - independent approximation , achieving an optimal washout ( given by the sum @xmath245 ) necessarily required that both @xmath246 and @xmath247 were small @xcite . as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mt_01_e]-[eq : mt_01_t ] ) , when flavour effects are included , washout considerations still favour parameter regions with small @xmath246 and @xmath247",
    ". nevertheless , in the flavour - dependent treatment , the individual washout parameters @xmath108 are typically smaller than their sum , @xmath117 , and can significantly differ from each other .",
    "it is therefore pertinent to re - investigate whether other regions of parameter space may also allow for optimal washout .",

    "@xcite ) . parameterising the solutions to the seesaw equation by means of a complex orthogonal matrix @xmath7  @xcite , we have analysed which regions of the seesaw parameter space generically enable optimal efficiency and/or optimal decay asymmetries for leptogenesis .",
    "we have discussed several differences between the flavour - independent approximation and the correct flavour - dependent treatment of thermal leptogenesis .",
    "these are extensive , and , together with the bounds from the reheat temperature , lead to interesting new constraints on the susy seesaw parameter space .",
    "considerations on @xmath10 give rise to the first constraints , in the sense that a dramatic drop in the efficiency takes place for @xmath349 ( as much as three orders of magnitude for @xmath350 ) . since we have assumed that only the decays of the lightest right - handed neutrino were relevant for the lepton asymmetry , no bounds on the masses @xmath169 and @xmath170 were derived .",
    "assuming an optimal regime for the decay asymmetry and for the efficiency , as well as that the inflaton only decays into mssm particles ( and not directly into right - handed ( s)neutrinos ) , the requirement of a successful bau leads to lower bounds on @xmath76 as well as on the reheat temperature .",
    "in particular , we have found @xmath351 gev and @xmath352 gev , similar to the results obtained in the flavour - independent approximation  @xcite . on the other hand , in the presence of upper bounds on the reheat temperature ( from dark matter relic abundance considerations ) , an upper bound on @xmath76",
    "can also be inferred . in order to illustrate the impact of reheating , we have considered two examples for @xmath10 , corresponding to mildly and strongly constrained scenarios : @xmath353 gev , and @xmath191 gev . regarding the upper bound on @xmath76 , the latter bounds respectively yield @xmath190 gev , and @xmath192 gev .",
    "this leads to viability windows for the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino .",
    "regarding the light neutrino masses , namely @xmath64 , in general there is no upper bound from flavour - dependent thermal leptogenesis . nevertheless , increasing @xmath64 within the present allowed experimental upper bounds ( of roughly @xmath204 ev ) , generically results in a reduced bau .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of strong @xmath10 bounds , quasi - degenerate light neutrino masses ( via the type - i seesaw mechanism ) become disfavoured .    as in the flavour - independent approximation , considerations on the washout parameters generically favour the region of small @xmath354 and @xmath355 .",
    "however , and in clear contrast to the flavour - independent approximation , new regions with optimal flavour - dependent washout parameters have emerged , in association with large values of @xmath354 and @xmath355 . in any case , in order to produce sufficient bau in the presence of mild ( or even strong ) constraints on the reheat temperature , the decay asymmetries must also be close to their optimal values . regarding the flavour - dependent decay asymmetries , in the general case of complex @xmath7 matrix ( but considering the limit of a real @xmath1 ) , we generically recovered the main results of the one - flavour computation ( in the sense that the favoured regions still corresponded to small @xmath354 and @xmath355 , albeit slightly enlarged ) .",
    "another important result of our analysis concerns the effects of the reheat temperature , which were clearly manifest .",
    "in fact , taking stronger bounds on @xmath10 leads to a significant reduction in the bau allowed regions of the @xmath356-@xmath357 and @xmath358-@xmath359 parameter spaces ( even to the disappearance of the wmap compatible regions ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath191 gev , we have seen that @xmath233 can not exclusively account for the observed wmap results .    in flavour - dependent leptogenesis , a potentially important role",
    "can also be played by the @xmath1 phases . in principle , viable bau scenarios could be obtained in the presence of a cp - conserving @xmath7-matrix , with the required amount of cp violation stemming either from the dirac phase @xmath45 , or from the majorana phases @xmath165 and @xmath166 . in the sm , this situation has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , the constraints on the seesaw parameters in the mssm are expected to differ from the sm case , since for the temperatures ( and values of @xmath114 ) under consideration , all flavours are separately treated in the mssm boltzmann equations , whereas only the @xmath71-flavour is separately considered in the sm case .    exclusively relying on the phase @xmath45 and on @xmath162 ( under the standard parameterisation of the @xmath1 matrix ) is a phenomenologically challenging choice , since these are the most likely ( yet ) unknown @xmath1 parameters to be experimentally measured .",
    "however , we have verified that even with @xmath360 , for values of @xmath361 ( the present experimental limit ) the obtained values of the baryon asymmetry are only marginally compatible with observation ( when large theoretical uncertainties are allowed for ) . by themselves , and even in the limit @xmath362 , both majorana phases , @xmath165 and @xmath166 , could in principle account for bau .",
    "however , and similar to @xmath45 , only marginal consistency with observations can be reached . in both cases",
    "the impact of the reheating temperature becomes manifest , since lower values of @xmath10 can render these scenarios inviable .",
    "we also note that in the presence of small @xmath363 , the bau generated from cp violation in the right - handed sector dominates over the contributions from low - energy phases .",
    "thus , the sensitivity to the @xmath1 cp violating phases is lost . in the limit of very strict bounds on the reheat temperature , one",
    "is thus compelled to take into account complex @xmath7 as an additional source of cp violation .    in summary ,",
    "we have investigated which regions of the susy seesaw parameter space are favoured by flavour - dependent thermal leptogenesis , when bounds on the reheat temperature are taken into account . for mildly constrained @xmath10 ( e.g.  @xmath364 gev ) , compatibility with the bau observed by wmap can be obtained for extensive new regions of the @xmath232-@xmath233 parameter space , which were previously disfavoured in the flavour - independent approximation . on the other hand , focusing on ( normal ) hierarchical light and heavy neutrinos , the scenario where only cp violation from the @xmath1 is considered ( real @xmath7 ) , turns out to be only marginally consistent , even for @xmath365 , and under mild bounds on @xmath185 .",
    "stricter @xmath10 bounds ( e.g.  @xmath366 gev ) strongly motivate that cp is ( also ) violated in the right - handed neutrino sector . while extensive regions of the @xmath232-@xmath233 parameter space can produce bau close to the wmap range in this case , the favoured seesaw parameter space , clearly consistent with observations , is that of small values of @xmath354 and @xmath355 .",
    "given the attractiveness of the mechanism of thermal leptogenesis , and the interesting constraints it can provide , it would be desirable to further refine the computation of the baryon asymmetry .",
