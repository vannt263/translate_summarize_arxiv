    "the log - normal distribution is important because it has been observed very often at least as a good approximation in the natural and the social sciences @xcite . in physics , examples include fragment size @xcite , crystal size @xcite , wave transmittance in random media @xcite , turbulence energy @xcite , dissipation rate of turbulence energy @xcite , durations of transient events @xcite , stellar mass @xcite , and cosmological density fluctuations @xcite . also for temporal fluctuations of some nonlinear systems",
    "@xcite , a fundamental parameter is considered to vary slowly in a log - normal distribution .",

    "since this log - normal distribution tends to a gaussian distribution as @xmath10 , our observation is yet in accordance with the central limit theorem .",

    "indeed , the standard process for the log - normal distribution , i.e. , multiplication of random variables , leads instead to a power - law distribution if a minimum value is set for the variables @xcite or if random noise is added at each step of the multiplication @xcite .",

    "the observed skewness is often small so that the distribution is confusingly similar to a gaussian distribution @xcite",
    ". such a case might turn out to be an example for a log - normal distribution from a sum , which tends to a gaussian distribution with a further increase in the total number of the summands .",
    "the promising approach is to study the distribution beyond the range of the central limit theorem , i.e. , large deviations from the average , or to study the process itself , e.g. , whether it is for a linear or for a nonlinear system .",
