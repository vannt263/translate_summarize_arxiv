    "superstring theories@xcite , which may be the most attractive candidates to unify all known interactions including gravity , have a number of flat directions , called moduli fields , in a large class of classical ground states@xcite .",
    "these moduli fields @xmath4 continuously connect infinitely degenerate supersymmetric vacua and they are generally expected to acquire their masses @xmath5 of the order of the gravitino mass @xmath6 once supersymmetry breaking effects are included@xcite .",
    "these moduli fields cause different kinds of cosmological problems @xcite depending on values of their masses . at present",
    "the thermal inflation proposed by lyth and stewart @xcite seems to be the most plausible solution to the problems . in recent articles@xcite ,",
    "we have shown by postulating the thermal inflation that only two regions of the moduli masses , @xmath7 500 kev and @xmath8(100 ) gev , are cosmologically viable .",
    "in particular , the lighter mass region is more interesting since the original affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite does work here as shown first by de gauva , moroi and murayama@xcite . on the contrary , for @xmath8(100 ) gev we must invoke a variant type of affleck - dine baryogenesis@xcite which has not been , however , well investigated yet .    if the moduli masses lie indeed in the region @xmath9",
    "kev200 kev there is an intriguing possibility@xcite that the moduli fields are the dark matter in our universe .",
    "since the thermal inflation produces a tremendous amount of entropy at the late epoch of the universe s evolution to dilute the moduli density substantially , there seems to be no candidate left for the dark matter beside the moduli themselves.@xmath10 gev could be another candidate for the dark matter@xcite . ]",
    "this would encourage us to consider the hypothesis of moduli being the dark matter in the universe .    in this paper",
    "we calculate spectrum of background x - rays emitted from the moduli dark matter and find that the spectrum is constituted of two distinct parts : one comes from the cosmic moduli filling homogeneously the whole universe and the other from the moduli condensed on the dark halo in our galaxy .",
    "the former has a relatively broad spectrum due to the redshift effect and the latter has a peak in the energy spectrum .",
    "we show that the peak in the x - ray spectrum can be detectable in future experiments if the moduli masses @xmath5 are around 100 kev .",
    "we also briefly comment on @xmath3-ray spectrum emitted from more massive moduli of @xmath11 1  10gev , since this multi - gev mass region is marginally allowed @xcite if one assumes somewhat smaller values of the initial amplitudes of moduli fields , @xmath12 ( 0.01  0.1)@xmath13 , where @xmath13 is the gravitational scale @xmath14 gev .",
    "we find that the @xmath3-rays emitted from such moduli make a large bump in multi - mev region and the shape of the spectrum depends heavily on the masses of moduli .",
    "in this section we briefly review the previous works @xcite and show that only two mass regions such as @xmath15 500 kev and @xmath8(100 ) gev survive various cosmological constraints .",
    "we assume @xmath16 throughout this paper .",
    "let us start with the cosmological moduli problems . as mentioned in the introduction the moduli fields of masses in the range of kev - tev cause different kinds of cosmological problems @xcite depending on their masses . on one hand , the moduli with masses @xmath17(100 ) gev",
    "@xmath18(1 ) tev decay soon after nucleosynthesis and in consequence spoil the success of big - bang nucleosynthesis . on the other hand ,",
    "the moduli with masses @xmath19 1 gev are entangled with the problem that the abundance of moduli themselves overcloses the present universe , or the radiation expected from their decay may exceed the observed cosmic x(@xmath3)-ray backgrounds . in any case , one finds it difficult to solve these problems as far as one is concerned with the standard cosmology .",
    "we give now a brief account of the thermal inflation which is thought to be the only mechanism to overcome the above problems . in their original paper , lyth and stewart@xcite",
    "proposed a solution for the case of moduli masses @xmath17(100 ) gev @xmath20(1 ) tev , that corresponds to hidden sector supersymmetry breaking models  @xcite .",
    "thus , let us restrict ourselves in the following discussion to the mass region @xmath21 kev @xmath22 10 gev , that is relevant to gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models  @xcite .",
    "when we discuss the abundance of moduli energy density @xmath23 , it is convenient to introduce a ratio @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the entropy density , since this quantity is invariant under the universe s evolution as long as no entropy is produced",
    ". then the problems stated above are reexpressed as that the present value of the ratio @xmath24 is predicted to be greater than the ratio @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the critical density of the present universe , by typical factors of @xmath28  @xmath10 .",
    "if the thermal inflation takes place , however , a significant increase in the entropy density leads to an extreme reduction of the quantity @xmath24 .",
    "the existence of flaton fields is required to provide vacuum energy , which is responsible for the thermal inflation to occur , and to produce entropy by their decay into radiation .",
    "the potential of the flaton @xmath0 is given by @xcite can be interpreted as a massless ng boson originating from the u(1 ) symmetry possessed by the potential ( [ flaton - pot ] ) .",
    "the ng bosons produced by the flaton decay diminish drastically the dilution effect of the thermal inflation .",
    "we have given in @xcite such a modification of the original thermal inflation model that this unfavorable decay mode is suppressed .",
    "it has been found , however , that the modification did not affect the original dynamics in ref.@xcite ] @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a negative mass squared induced by susy breaking effect and @xmath31 a cut - off scale of this effective theory . the vacuum energy density @xmath32",
    "is determined so that the cosmological constant vanishes at the true vacuum .",
    "if the flaton @xmath0 couples to some fields which are in thermal bath , the flaton potential ( [ flaton - pot ] ) with finite temperature effects taken into account reads @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the cosmic temperature and @xmath35 a constant of @xmath17(1 ) . as be easily seen from the form of the effective potential ( [ flaton - eff - pot ] ) , the flaton sits near the origin at the temperature @xmath36 , and gives rise to the vacuum energy density @xmath32 . this vacuum energy becomes greater than the radiation energy at the temperature @xmath37 , since the radiation energy density is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the effective number of degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , for the temperature @xmath40 the flaton vacuum energy density dominates the cosmic energy density , and the thermal inflation takes place .",
    "when the cosmic temperature becomes lower than the critical temperature , i.e. @xmath41 , the flaton begins rolling down towards the true minimum of the potential ( [ flaton - pot ] ) , and oscillates around it .",
    "the flaton coherent oscillation energy is eventually transferred to the radiation energy through the flaton decay and reheats the universe , increasing the entropy density by a factor of @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the reheating temperature .",
    "we are now at the point to evaluate the moduli energy density , with the notable effects of the thermal inflation considered .",
    "we assume only one modulus @xmath4 to exist for simplicity .",
    "the generalization to the case of many moduli is straightforward , however .",
    "when the hubble parameter @xmath44 becomes comparable to the modulus mass @xmath5 , the coherent oscillation of the modulus , which we refer to as ` big - bang modulus ' , starts with the initial amplitude @xmath45 which is likely to be of the order @xmath13 .",
    "then , the abundance of ` big - bang modulus ' after the thermal inflation is calculated as @xmath46 we should not forget ` thermal inflation modulus ' that is a secondary oscillation , which begins after the thermal inflation , stimulated by the shift @xmath47 from the true minimum of the modulus potential .",
    "the abundance of this ` thermal inflation modulus ' is @xmath48 the total energy density of the modulus @xmath4 is then given by @xmath49 .",
    "\\label{moduli - density}\\ ] ]    in ref.@xcite , we regarded @xmath50 and @xmath51 as free parameters and obtained the theoretically predicted lower bound of ( [ moduli - density ] ) , under the condition @xmath52 10 mev that is required in order for the radiation created by the flaton decay not to upset the nucleosynthesis . as a result , we have shown that for all the region @xmath21 kev @xmath22 10 gev the lower bound of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is the present hubble parameter @xmath55 in units of 100km / sec / mpc ) could be taken below the critical density @xmath56 .    a constraint from the observed x(@xmath3)-ray backgrounds , however , can be more stringent@xcite than that from the critical density in a certain modulus mass region .",
    "the modulus decays into two photons dominantly .",
    "thus , we can derive another constraint on @xmath57 by requiring that the maximum value of the predicted photon flux should be less than the observed x(@xmath3)-ray backgrounds .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this constraint excludes an interesting mass region 500 kev @xmath22 10 gev .",
    "let us summarize the conclusions that were obtained in @xcite .",
    "first , we have found that only the theories with modulus mass @xmath21 kev @xmath22 500 kev could survive the cosmological constraints . in eq.([flaton - pot ] ) as @xmath58 , which is a natural choice , only the modulus with @xmath59 100 kev is cosmologically allowed for @xmath15 500 kev and becomes the dark matter of our universe @xcite . ]",
    "second , we have pointed out that the modulus with mass @xmath11 1  10 gev also had a chance to be allowed cosmologically if we could take @xmath12 ( 0.01  0.1)@xmath13 .",
    "the final one , which has motivated us to work on this paper , is that in the modulus mass region @xmath21 kev @xmath60 200 kev the equality @xmath61(1 ) could be fulfilled @xcite because in this region the constraint from x(@xmath3)-ray backgrounds is weaker than that from the critical density .",
    "this observation is none other than the reason why we have stressed in the introduction that the moduli could be the dark matter in our universe .",
    "as shown in previous section , the modulus field with mass @xmath62 @xmath21kev  200 kev is a candidate for the dark matter of our universe .",
    "this upper limit of the modulus mass originates from the constraint of the observed cosmic photon backgrounds .",
    "the modulus field decays most likely to two photons through non - renormalizable interaction suppressed by the gravity scale .",
    "the lifetime of the modulus is estimated as@xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes a parameter of order one which depends on the models of the superstring . in the following we take @xmath64 = 1 . from eq.([tau - phi ] ) the modulus with mass @xmath15 100 mev has a lifetime longer than the age of the present universe .",
    "however , such modulus is continuously decaying at the rate of @xmath65 and produce photons which contribute to the diffuse photon backgrounds .",
    "this excludes the region 500 kev @xmath22 1 gev .",
    "furthermore , when we assume the cosmic modulus field as the dark matter of our universe ( @xmath66(1 ) ) , a region @xmath21kev @xmath22 200 kev survives from the cosmological constraints .",
    "if the modulus field is indeed the dark matter , it would be the other contribution to the photon backgrounds .",
    "some of the dark - matter moduli should be trapped in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "since the doppler spread due to the velocities of the moduli is negligible in this case , the narrow line spectrum is expected by the decay of the dark - matter moduli in our halo .    in this section",
    "we consider the dark - matter moduli with mass @xmath67 100 kev and investigate the @xmath0-ray spectrum of the produced photons in the decay , since such @xmath0-ray may be observable in the future experiments as we will describe below .",
    "first we discuss the @xmath0-ray spectrum by the decay of the cosmic moduli distributed uniformly over the whole universe . through the modulus decay two monochromatic photons with energy @xmath68",
    "are produced .",
    "when we integrate such line spectrum from the past to the present , the continuum spectrum below the energy @xmath69 is observed today . in refs.@xcite the photon flux from the decay of the moduli in the whole universe is estimated as @xmath70 with @xmath71^{-1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the density parameter of the cosmological constant , @xmath73 the redshift and @xmath74 the cosmic time at @xmath73 .",
    "this flux takes its maximal value at the photon energy @xmath75 in particular , when the modulus field is the dark matter , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 it should be notice that this equation is independent of @xmath79 and @xmath72 .    in fig.1",
    "we show the spectrum of the photon flux ( [ f_u ] ) for various moduli masses . then the @xmath0-ray intensity from the whole universe is given by @xmath80 as shown in fig.1 ,",
    "the flux from the moduli decay is comparable to the observed @xmath0-ray backgrounds if the mass of the modulus is @xmath81kev .",
    "next we consider the @xmath0-ray spectrum coming from the dark - matter moduli trapped in the our galactic halo .",
    "since the cosmological redshift is negligible in this case , the photons produced by the decay have a monochromatic energy @xmath82 . here",
    "we estimate the intensity of this line spectrum .",
    "the mass density of the halo of our galaxy at the distance @xmath83 from the center of the galaxy is expressed as@xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 kpc and the halo density in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath86 8.5 kpc ) is @xmath87 0.38 gev/@xmath88 .",
    "then the density of the modulus component in the halo is given by @xmath89 .",
    "using the halo density ( [ rho_halo ] ) the line flux is estimated as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the distance to the modulus particle from the sun and @xmath92 ( @xmath64 ) is the galactic longitude ( latitude ) .",
    "after the @xmath91 integration , we obtain the following expression @xmath93 ,   \\end{aligned}\\]]with @xmath94 .",
    "then the diffuse line intensity from the galactic halo is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the energy resolution at @xmath97 of the experiment .",
    "here it should be noted that the line flux depends on the direction of the incoming photon , i.e. @xmath64- and @xmath92-dependence , and that the intensity of the line @xmath0-ray spectrum from the galactic halo becomes more significant in the experiments with higher energy resolution , which contrasts to the continuous spectrum produced by the decay of the moduli in the whole universe .",
    "then we compare the line intensity from the moduli in our galactic halo to the maximum value of the @xmath0-ray intensity from the moduli that spread over the whole universe . for this end",
    "it is convenient to introduce the ratio @xmath98 defined as @xmath99 for the dark - matter moduli this ratio @xmath98 is almost independent on the modulus mass @xmath5 since we can neglect the exponential factor in eq.([f_u ] ) .",
    "if we see the direction of the north or south galactic poles , this ratio becomes @xmath100    in fig.2 we show the contour of the ratio @xmath98 in the @xmath64-@xmath92 plane for the case @xmath11 200 kev ( i.e. @xmath101 = 100 kev ) and @xmath102 = 10 % .-ray backgrounds at energy @xmath103 kev were measured by @xmath104-i experiment@xcite whose energy resolution @xmath102 is about 10 % .",
    "] we find that the line intensity is about two times stronger than the peak of the continuum spectrum in the wide region of the sky . in fig.3",
    "we also show the intensity of the line photons in the direction @xmath105 together with the continuous spectrum ( [ continuos ] ) for the energy resolution @xmath106% and 5% and for the modulus mass 100kev and 200kev .",
    "it is seen that the photon intensity from the moduli in the whole universe is below or marginal to the observed one for @xmath107kev or 200kev , but the line intensity from the halo moduli is above the observed one .",
    "thus , future experiments with energy resolution @xmath108% at energy around @xmath109 can detect the line intensity from the dark - matter moduli in our halo for @xmath110kev .",
    "furthermore , by observing the @xmath64- or @xmath92-dependence of the @xmath0-ray intensity of the peak , we may confirm the origin of the peak , i.e. it originates from the line spectrum produced by the decay of the dark - matter moduli in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "the cosmic modulus field with multi - gev mass decays into two photons until the present .",
    "since the produced photons are redshifted by the cosmic expansion , they form the continuum spectrum which takes it maximal value at mev region .",
    "thus the decay of the multi - gev modulus field may be observed as a mev - bump in the spectrum of the background @xmath3-rays if the produced photons reach us directly .",
    "however , such high energy photons may be scattered off the background photons and its spectrum may be deformed . for the case of the multi - gev modulus",
    ", we can neglect the double photon pair creation process : @xmath111 because the energy of the produced photons is below the effective threshold @xmath112(@xmath113 : electron mass , @xmath34 : background temperature )  @xcite .",
    "thus we take into account only the photon photon scattering process : @xmath114 by which the emitted photons from the moduli lose their energy .",
    "since the total cross section of the photon photon scattering is proportional to @xmath115 , ( @xmath101 denotes an energy of the emitted photon . ) , this process becomes significant only for modulus with mass larger than @xmath116gev . in this section",
    "we estimate the photon spectrum emitted from the multi - gev moduli including the effect of the scattering with the background s photons .    in order to obtain the photon spectrum",
    "we solve the following boltzmann equation for the distribution function @xmath117  @xcite : @xmath118 ^ 2      \\int_0^{\\infty } d \\overline{\\epsilon } ~      \\overline{\\epsilon}^3 ~\\overline{f}(\\overline{\\epsilon } ) \\nonumber \\\\      & - &       \\frac{1946}{50625 \\pi } \\frac{\\alpha^4}{m_e^8 }      e_\\gamma^3 f_\\gamma(e_\\gamma )      \\int_0^\\infty d \\overline{\\epsilon } ~      \\overline{\\epsilon}^3 ~\\overline{f}(\\overline{\\epsilon } ) \\nonumber \\\\      & - &      2 h f_\\gamma(e_\\gamma ) \\nonumber \\\\      & + &      \\frac{1}{4 \\pi } \\frac { 2 \\rho_{\\phi } } { \\tau_\\phi m_\\phi }      \\mbox{e}^ { - \\frac{t}{\\tau_\\phi } }      \\delta \\left ( e_\\gamma - \\frac{m_\\phi}{2 } \\right ) ,      \\label{bz - eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 denotes the distribution function of the background photon at temperature @xmath34 : @xmath120 we solve the boltzmann equation ( [ bz - eq ] ) numerically including the evolution of the universe .",
    "the continuum @xmath3-ray spectrum of the modulus decay is obtained using the present distribution function as @xmath121 = @xmath122 .",
    "we show the spectra for @xmath123 and @xmath124 and @xmath125gev in fig.4 .",
    "the effect of the photon photon scattering off the background photons is negligible for @xmath126gev . on the other hand , for the modulus with mass @xmath127 gev",
    ", we find that photons at the peak of the spectrum significantly lose their energy by the scattering and the peak of the spectrum moves to a lower energy region .",
    "therefore , comparing with the observed background photon spectrum , it is found that the constraint becomes slightly weaker for the modulus with mass @xmath128 gev than that obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper we have examined the photon spectra from the decay of the cosmic modulus field .",
    "first we have considered the modulus mass region @xmath129 @xmath21kev200 kev .",
    "this region is interesting because the modulus field can be the dark matter in our universe .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath0-ray continuum spectrum from the decay of the dark - matter moduli that spread homogeneously in the whole universe and the line spectrum from the dark - matter moduli trapped in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "it is found that with the energy resolution of the current experiments ( @xmath130% ) the line intensity is about twice stronger than that of the continuum spectrum in the wide region of the sky . if the modulus mass is around 100 kev , both intensities are comparable with the present observed photon backgrounds .",
    "therefore , in the future experiments with higher energy resolutions it may be possible to detect the line photons produced by the decay of dark - matter moduli in our halo .",
    "moreover , by measuring the dependence of the line intensity on the galactic longitude and latitude , we will be able to confirm the origin , i.e. it comes from the halo of our galaxy rather than from the whole universe .",
    "we have also investigated the @xmath3-ray spectrum emitted from the decay of the multi - gev modulus field . in this modulus mass region ,",
    "the emitted photons are redshifted and have a peak in the mev region of the spectrum .",
    "thus we may observed those photons as a mev - bump in the @xmath3-ray backgrounds .",
    "the produced high energy photon may be scattered off the background photons and lose their energy .",
    "it is found that the effect of the scattering is negligible for modulus with mass less than @xmath131gev .",
    "however , if the modulus mass is of the order of 10 gev , the emitted photons at the peak of the continuum spectrum loses their energy by the scattering and the shape of the spectrum is significantly changed .",
    "this makes the constraint from the present observed @xmath3-ray backgrounds weaker than the result in ref.@xcite .",
