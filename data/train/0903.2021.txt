    "the internal structure of a realistic ( astronomical ) rotating black hole has remained an unsolved problem for decades ( e.g.   20.5 of @xcite ,  5.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of a rotating black hole in the process of collapsing is undoubtedly thoroughly complicated @xcite .",
    "however , thanks to the no - hair theorem @xcite , it is expected that a newly collapsed rotating black hole will quickly relax to the kerr geometry . aside from the initial collapse event , and rare occasions of high accretion such as a black hole merger , a real astronomical black hole spends the great majority of its life accurately described by the kerr geometry down to near its inner horizon .",
    "the reason that the kerr geometry fails inside a black hole is that at ( or rather just above ) the inner horizon , the kerr geometry is subject to the relativistic counter - streaming instability discovered by @xcite , and called by them mass inflation .",
    "the inflationary instability is the nonlinear realization of the infinite blueshift at the inner horizon first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "mass inflation inside spherical charged black holes has been investigated extensively ( see e.g.  the lists of references in @xcite ) , but there have been few studies of inflation inside rotating black holes @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) .    the present paper addresses , and solves , the problem of the internal structure of a slowly rotating , charged black hole that is undergoing inflation at its inner horizon .",
    "inflation requires the simultaneous presence of ingoing and outgoing streams near the inner horizon ; but even the tiniest incident streams suffice to induce inflation .",
    "the paper follows earlier papers in this series @xcite in assuming that ingoing and outgoing streams are being generated continuously and steadily by accretion .",
    "this assumption differs from most of the literature on inflation , which has focused on the situation where a black hole collapses and then remains isolated @xcite , in which case the outgoing stream is dominated by a decaying price tail @xcite of gravitational radiation .",
    "real astronomical black holes are however never isolated , and it seems likely that any decaying price tail produced by the initial collapse event will soon be overwhelmed by streams generated by accretion .",
    "matter that falls from outside the horizon is necessarily initially ingoing , but it may become outgoing inside the horizon if it has enough charge ( if the black hole is charged ) or enough angular momentum ( if the black hole is rotating ) .",
    "the approach followed in the present paper is to introduce a small rotational perturbation to a spherically symmetric black hole that is undergoing inflation .",
    "it is necessary to assume that the black hole is charged so that the unperturbed geometry has an inner horizon where inflation is taking place . in this sense",
    "the solution is not realistic , since a real black hole probably has tiny charge .",
    "however , one may hope that the solution for the internal structure of a slowly rotating , charged black hole may shed light on the real problem of a fully rotating , uncharged black hole .    as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the radial length scale over which the interior mass and other gauge - invariant quantities ( such as the weyl curvature , and the center - of - mass density and pressure ) exponentiate during inflation is proportional to the accretion rate of the incident ingoing and outgoing streams .",
    "thus , counter - intuitively , the smaller the accretion rate , the more rapidly inflation exponentiates as a function of radius . in the limit of a tiny accretion rate ,",
    "the structure resembles a step function at the inner horizon , above which the kerr - newman geometry applies to an excellent approximation , and at which the interior mass and other quantities inflate to absurdly huge values while the radius scarcely changes .",
    "astronomically realistic black holes have small accretion rates over the great majority of their lifetimes , the accretion timescale being much longer than the black hole crossing time .",
    "for small accretion rates it might seem justifiable to assume the stationary approximation @xmath0 ( which @xcite terms the homogeneous approximation , since the killing vector associated with time translation symmetry is spacelike inside the horizon ) .",
    "it is true that the spacetime is almost stationary , temporal partial derivatives being much smaller than radial partial derivatives , @xmath1 , but it is strictly stationary only in the unrealistic case of symmetrically equal ingoing and outgoing streams @xcite .",
    "the reason that stationarity breaks down is that quantities such as the interior mass @xmath2 inflate so rapidly that @xmath3 is never small in the inflationary zone even in the limit of infinitesimal accretion rates .",
    "although the slowly - rotating black hole spacetimes considered in this paper are not time - translation invariant , the equations do admit solutions with conformal time - translation symmetry , or self - similarity .",
    "self - similar solutions are considered herein .",
    "this paper follows  @xcite in adopting the following line - element for a general spherically symmetric background spacetime , in polar coordinates @xmath4 : @xmath5 through the identity @xmath6 the line - element  ( [ lineelement ] ) encodes not only a metric @xmath7 , but a complete inverse vierbein @xmath8 , corresponding vierbein @xmath9 , and orthonormal tetrad @xmath10 , satisfying @xmath11 with @xmath12 the minkowski metric .",
    "the coefficients @xmath13 in the line - element  ( [ lineelement ] ) constitute the components of a covariant tetrad - frame 4-vector , the radial 4-gradient @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the directed derivative along the @xmath16 tetrad axis ( not to be confused with the coordinate derivative @xmath17 ) . physically , the directed derivatives @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the proper time and radial derivatives measured by a person at rest in the tetrad frame .",
    "the scalar product of @xmath13 with itself defines the interior , or misner - sharp @xcite , mass @xmath2 , a gauge - invariant scalar @xmath20 details of the vierbein , tetrad - frame connections , and tetrad - frame riemann , einstein , and weyl tensors that follow from the unperturbed line - element  ( [ lineelement ] ) are summarized in appendix  a of @xcite .",
    "perturbations to the spherically symmetric spacetime can be characterized by the dimensionless covariant tetrad - frame vierbein perturbation @xmath21 defined by @xmath22 where the overscript @xmath23 signifies an unperturbed quantity . because the perturbation @xmath21 is of linear order , it is legitimate to raise and lower its indices with the unperturbed tetrad - frame metric ( the minkowski metric ) , and to transform between coordinate and tetrad frames with the unperturbed vierbein @xmath24 and its inverse @xmath25 .",
    "thus the vierbein perturbation @xmath21 can be regarded as a tensor field defined on the unperturbed spherically symmetric background .",
    "spherically symmetric spacetimes are invariant under the 3-dimensional group @xmath26 of orthogonal transformations .",
    "it is natural to expand perturbations in eigenmodes of that group .",
    "a perturbation eigenmode is characterized not only by its harmonic numbers @xmath27 , but also by its spin @xmath28 , which expresses how the perturbation transforms under rotations about the radial direction .",
    "perturbations @xmath21 admit scalar ( spin-@xmath29 ) , vector ( spin-@xmath30 ) , and tensor ( spin-@xmath31 ) modes .",
    "the spin of a perturbation @xmath21 is most easily identified not in an orthonormal tetrad , as here , but rather in a spinor tetrad , where the angular tetrad axes @xmath32 and @xmath33 are replaced by spinor axes @xmath34 the general rule is that the spin of a tensor equals the sum of the @xmath35 s and @xmath36 s of its covariant indices in the spinor tetrad .",
    "a slowly rotating spacetime is obtained from a spherically symmetric spacetime by a perturbation that is ( a ) cylindrically symmetric , ( b ) axial , meaning that the perturbation changes sign under a flip @xmath37 of the azimuthal tetrad axis , and ( c ) dipole , the lowest order non - spherical harmonic .",
    "the slowly rotating conditions imply that the vierbein perturbation @xmath21 is a spin-@xmath38 dipole harmonic , @xmath39 of the 16 components of the @xmath40 tensor of perturbations @xmath21 , there are 4 that satisfy the conditions of being spin-@xmath38 and axial , namely @xmath41 the spin-@xmath38 axial character of these perturbations is manifest in a spinor tetrad , where the possible spin-@xmath38 perturbations are the 4 complex quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , and the axial condition implies that each of these 4 perturbations is purely imaginary .    of the 4 possible degrees of freedom represented by the perturbations  ( [ varphi ] ) , only one degree of freedom is coordinate and tetrad gauge - invariant , and therefore represents a real physical perturbation .",
    "the remaining 3 degrees of freedom represent gauge freedoms , comprising an infinitesimal coordinate transformation of the azimuthal coordinate @xmath46 , and infinitesimal tetrad ( lorentz ) transformations in the @xmath47-@xmath46 and @xmath48-@xmath46 planes .    under an infinitesimal coordinate gauge transformation of the azimuthal",

    "the spacetime is not time translation - invariant , conformal or otherwise , but as commented in the introduction it is legitimate to think of the spacetime as being almost stationary , and therefore the combination  ( [ coordinateinvariantperturbation ] ) is almost coordinate gauge - invariant .    the antisymmetric combinations @xmath55 and @xmath56 are not tetrad gauge - invariant , the former transforming under an infinitesimal lorentz boost in the @xmath47-@xmath46 plane , the latter transforming under an infinitesimal spatial rotation in the @xmath48-@xmath46 plane . the symmetric combinations @xmath57 and @xmath58 are tetrad gauge - invariant .",
    "if the spacetime were time translation - invariant or conformally time translation - invariant then the combination @xmath59 would be gauge - invariant with respect to both infinitesimal coordinate and tetrad gauge transformations . again , in general the spacetime is not time translation - invariant , but it is legitimate to think of the combination  ( [ gaugeinvariantperturbation ] ) as being almost coordinate and tetrad gauge - invariant . in terms of the almost - gauge - invariant perturbation @xmath60 defined below , the combination  ( [ gaugeinvariantperturbation ] ) equals @xmath61 . in the general case , there is no linear combination of vierbein perturbations @xmath21 that is fully gauge - invariant , but the axial spin-@xmath29 component of the weyl tensor provides a differential combination @xmath62 of vierbein perturbations , equation  ( [ w ] ) , that is fully gauge - invariant .    in view of the behavior under gauge transformations",
    "just discussed , it is convenient to introduce 4 quantities @xmath60 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 representing the different types of perturbation as follows : [ perturbationvariables ] @xmath66 in terms of which the vierbein perturbation @xmath21 is @xmath67 the perturbations @xmath68 are tetrad - frame components of the killing vector associated with cylindrical symmetry , equation  ( [ zetam ] ) .",

    "the interior charge @xmath99 can be treated as effectively constant as a function of radius , @xmath252 initially , before inflation , the charge is constant simply because the small accretion rate implies a small charge density . during inflation ,",
    "as first pointed out by @xcite , lagrangian volume elements remain little distorted even though the tidal force ( weyl curvature ) exponentiates hugely .",
    "the physical reason for the mild distortion is that a volume element experiences only a tiny proper time during inflation , so that the tidal force , though huge , has too little time to do damage . because volume elements change little during inflation , and",
    "because charge density is conserved and the initial charge density is small , therefore the charge density remains always small , and the interior charge @xmath99 is effectively constant .    for constant interior charge @xmath99 , the einstein equation  ( [ einsteintogetherr ] ) integrates along the worldline of any tetrad frame to @xmath253 here the integral with respect to proper time @xmath190 along the worldline of the tetrad has been converted to an integral with respect to radius @xmath48 using @xmath254 .",

    "the proper density and pressure @xmath119 and @xmath120 of a stream change only mildly ( because lagrangian volume elements distort mildly ) , and , thanks to conservation of angular momentum , the angular momentum parameter @xmath126 of the stream likewise changes little .",
    "the only factor that could potentially become large in the integrand of the integral  ( [ streamintegral ] ) is the ratio @xmath257 .",
    "the integrals in equation  ( [ einsteintogetherrintegrated ] ) can be evaluated in any tetrad frame ( the same frame for both streams ) ; one option is to choose the no - going frame , defined to be the frame where @xmath258 .",
    "relative to the no - going frame , the streaming velocity @xmath133 and @xmath154 both increase exponentially , but they increase approximately in proportion to each other @xcite .",
    "the result is that the integral  ( [ streamintegral ] ) remains small because @xmath259 is small , and the other factors in the integrand do not spoil that conclusion .",
    "the integral over either stream in equation  ( [ einsteintogetherrintegrated ] ) involves the product @xmath260 of the angular momentum parameter and the proper density plus pressure .",
    "the integrals are small compared to the other terms in equation  ( [ einsteintogetherrintegrated ] ) provided that @xmath261 in geometric units ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "if the streams are slowly rotating , @xmath262 , then the integrals are small provided that @xmath263 .",
    "but if the accretion rate is sufficiently small that it satisfies the stronger condition that @xmath264 then the integrals remain small even if the angular momentum parameter @xmath126 is large , of order unity in geometric units . the fact that the integrals remain small , equation  ( [ streamintegral ] ) , even for large angular momenta means that the instantaneous angular motion of the accreting streams has effectively negligble effect on the spacetime structure of the slowly - rotating black hole , even in the case that the accreting streams have large angular momentum and any angular motion , not just cylindrically symmetric rotation about the rotation axis . of course , ultimately the angular momentum of the black hole is equal to the cumulative angular momentum of the accreted streams ; but the instantaneous angular motion is essentially irrelevant .    in the approximations  ( [ qconstant ] ) and ( [ streamintegral ] ) , valid for small enough accretion rates , equation  ( [ einsteintogetherrintegrated ] ) simplifies to @xmath265 which relates the axial weyl scalar @xmath62 to the axial magnetic field scalar @xmath100 without any dependence on the baryon or dark matter streams .    to complete the equations governing the spacetime structure for small accretion rates , equation  ( [ wsmallaccretion ] ) must be supplemented by an equation for the magnetic field @xmath100 , specifically equation  ( [ jphi ] ) with , since the accretion rate is small , vanishing right hand side .",
    "self - similar solutions provide a guide to what happens .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ brstar ] , @xmath100 is well - approximated by the slowly - rotating kerr - newman solution  ( [ knb ] ) before inflation sets in , and by approximation  ( [ binflationapproximation ] ) in the inflationary regime , the approximation  ( [ binflationapproximation ] ) depends on the regge - wheeler coordinate @xmath243 , which has the property that , as illustrated in figure  [ brstar ] , the derivative @xmath266 goes through a maximum near the onset of inflation , and then becomes progressively smaller during and after inflation .",
    "the net effect is that @xmath100 flattens out and becomes constant during and after inflation , which is true even though the constant @xmath250 in the approximation  ( [ binflationapproximation ] ) , which is effectively determined by matching to the kerr - newman approximation  ( [ knb ] ) at the onset of inflation , is non - zero . for small accretion rates ,",
    "the transition from the kerr - newman regime to the regime where @xmath100 is constant becomes increasingly abrupt , and @xmath100 simplifies to @xmath267 where @xmath268 is the radius of the erstwhile inner horizon , which is destroyed by inflation . the approximation  ( [ bsmallaccretion ] ) has been derived on the assumption of self - similarity , which is premised on the assumption of constant accretion rate @xmath167 .",
    "however , since the approximation  ( [ bsmallaccretion ] ) is independent of the value of the accretion rate , it may be guessed that the approximation  ( [ bsmallaccretion ] ) remains valid even for a variable accretion rate , just so long as the accretion rate remains small .",
    "the axial spin-@xmath29 weyl scalar @xmath62 is in a fundamental sense the ( coordinate and tetrad ) gauge - invariant quantity that describes the angular part of the gravitational field .",
    "the weyl scalar @xmath62 is related to the angular vierbein coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath63 by equation  ( [ w ] ) , which in the self - similar case becomes equation  ( [ selfsimilaromega ] ) , which depends only on @xmath60 . converted to a derivative with respect to @xmath269 instead of @xmath188 , the self - similar equation  ( [ selfsimilaromega ] ) for @xmath60",

    "the result is that , for small accretion rates , the vierbein coefficient @xmath60 is approximately equal to the kerr - newman form  ( [ knomega ] ) prior to inflation , and to a constant during and after inflation : @xmath273 as with equation  ( [ bsmallaccretion ] ) , equation  ( [ omegasmallaccretion ] ) has been derived on the assumption of self - similarity , but in fact the equation is independent of the value of the accretion rate , so it may be guessed that the approximation  ( [ omegasmallaccretion ] ) remains valid even for an accretion rate that varies with time , just so long as the accretion rate remains small .",
    "equations  ( [ wsmallaccretion])([omegasmallaccretion ] ) look enticingly simple , but one should be wary of interpreting them too literally , especially equation  ( [ omegasmallaccretion ] ) .",
    "for example , if the approximation @xmath274 in the inflationary regime were taken literally , then it would imply , from equation  ( [ selfsimilaromega ] ) , that @xmath275 , which is false .",
    "thus it would be incorrect to insert the approximation  ( [ omegasmallaccretion ] ) into the line - element  ( [ perturbedlineelement ] ) and imagine that the consequent riemann tensor would be valid .",
    "the problem is that inflation generates exponentially huge numbers , and something that by itself appears sensibly equal to zero may become significant when multiplied by a huge number .",
    "the slowly - rotating models considered in this paper have the limitation that the rates of accretion of ingoing and outgoing streams are assumed to be constant as a function of angular position about the black hole .",
    "this limitation is inherited from the assumption that the slow rotation is a small perturbation of a background spacetime that is spherically symmetric .",
    "the previous section showed that the angular motion of the accreting streams has negligible effect , for small accretion rates .",
