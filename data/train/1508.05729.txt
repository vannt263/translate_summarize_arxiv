    "these two scenarios are well supported by experiments for most of the temperature range between 10k and ambient temperature .",
    "only the splitting of the excited state measured with inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , while consistent with anti - ferro orbital ordering @xcite , is inconsistent with octupolar order@xcite .",
    "however , neither of these two models captures the two - stage ordering implied by the two peaks in the specific heat at 98 k and 127k .",
    "two possible configurations account for the observed double structural transition at @xmath12 and @xmath10 : ( i ) the coexistence of the low ( lt ) and the high temperature ( ht ) tetragonal phases , ( ii ) the onset of an intermediate orthorhombic distortion of the lattice associated to the transition from the ht to lt phase .",

    "examples of lattice mediated orbital ordering are well known in kcuf@xmath16 @xcite or in lamno@xmath16 @xcite . however , in those compounds @xmath17 electrons are involved , therefore the spin - orbit coupling does not play an essential role , contrary to the situation in sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 .",

    "the adiabatic potential in reduced dimensionless units describing these couplings is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the electron - lattice coupling constant normalized by the spin - orbit coupling constant , which varies as a function of temperature as well as the anti - ferromagnetic order parameter @xmath35 ( see appendix ) .",
    "in particular @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 above and below this temperature range . on the level of the individual @xmath47-ions ,",
    "the displacements of the surrounding oxygen ions are subject to zero - point motion . however , these motions are mechanically coupled between neighboring sites .",
    "the coordinate @xmath41 describing the collective vibration of all ions then represents a macroscopic observable , subject to the occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking with two energetically equivalent minima for positive and negative @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "the symmetry breaking disappears for high enough temperatures where thermal motion of the lattice overcomes the symmetry - broken state .",
    "the scenario is therefor as follows : for @xmath48 the electrons occupy orbital momentum eigenstates @xmath49 , without long - range intersite magnetic order .",
    "below @xmath10 a collective jahn - teller effect breaks the electronic symmetry by shifting the orbital character towards @xmath50 or @xmath51 while at the same time moving @xmath41 away from the origin .",
    "a similar dynamical regime is present in lamno@xmath16 but at much higher temperature ( @xmath52 k ) due to strong electron - lattice coupling @xcite .",
    "the static local jahn - teller effect usually leads to an anti - ferro distorted order , which globally preserves the tetragonal ( c4 ) symmetry ( see fig .",
    "[ orbital]c ) , but would induce a doubling of the unit cell in @xmath0-plane .",
    "this is not compatible with our experimental observations where a long range distortion is observed ( fig .",
    "[ xrd ] and fig .",

    "we therefor conjecture that the dynamical jahn - teller local distortions enable a ferro - nematic long range order induced by interaction via the phonon field .",
    "the magnetic transition in sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 occurs near 100 k. until now the experimental data have been interpreted as a first order transition , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath53 jumps to a finite value at @xmath12 ( see fig . 1 in ref . ) .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling causes the orbitals to polarize as @xmath49 , and the jahn - teller instability is suppressed due to the fact that the parameter @xmath54 jumps to a value smaller than 1 ( see appendix ) .",
    "indeed the tetragonal symmetry is recovered below @xmath12 as observed in the crystallographic data in fig .",
    "however , the evolution of the @xmath23-axis and @xmath11-axis parameters below @xmath12 suggests another scenario where there is a second order anti - ferromagnetic transition at @xmath29 .",
    "the magnetic order parameter @xmath53 than increases continuously ( fig .",
    "[ order]c ) . at @xmath12",
    "the condition @xmath55 is reached , below which the jahn - teller distortion disappears . in this scenario",
    "there are three critical temperatures : @xmath6 k , @xmath21 k and @xmath56 k. the steps @xmath12 k ( point 1 in fig .",
    "[ xrd]d ) and @xmath10 ( point 2 in fig .",
    "[ xrd]d ) in the entropy are associated with the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transitions that are visible in the crystallographic data around @xmath12 k and @xmath10 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the jahn - teller distortion and the anti - ferromagnetic order are described by combining the jahn - teller adiabatic potential and a ginzburg - landau expression for the free energy of the anti - ferromagnetic order parameter , as detailed in the appendix .",
    "the model calculation of the jahn - teller order parameter @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ order ] b ) and the experimental @xmath57 axis ratio ( fig .",
    "[ order ] a ) show qualitatively the same features : a gradual rise of @xmath34 below @xmath10 , sudden break at @xmath29 and disappearance at @xmath12 .",
    "these similarities suggest that the observed temperature dependence of the @xmath57 splitting is described by the combined effect of a jahn - teller distortion between @xmath12 and @xmath10 and the anti - ferromagnetic order of the spin - orbital mute moments below @xmath29 .",
    "it is worth noting that a very similar scenario of interplay between nematic order and a small distortion of the crystal lattice was recently discussed in iron - based superconducting pnictides .",
    "the instability in pnictides is not related to jt dynamical effect but to fermi surface nesting @xcite .",
    "the resulting nematic phase induces a very similar long range orthorhombic distortion with a re - entrant tetragonal structure at low temperature @xcite . a recent study on lasrvo@xmath2 reports that local jahn - teller distortions are responsible for a liquid orbital state @xcite .",
    "this is indeed one of the signposts of the nematic order suggested by the present work .",
    "the splitting in the crystal field optical excitation spectrum at @xmath10 ( fig . 5 in ref .",
    ") , originally attributed to the coexistence of two tetragonal phases , probably arises from the lifting of the degeneracy of the lowest kramers doublet by the lowering of the symmetry below the jt transition .",
    "in conclusion our high resolution powder diffraction measurements on tetragonal sr@xmath1vo@xmath2have revealed a second order transition to a weak orthorhombic distorted structure below @xmath4 k. in the temperature window from @xmath10 down to @xmath6 k , superexchange and spin - orbit coupling , which tend to favor an anti - ferro - orbital ground state , compete with a nematic orbital ordering supported by the dynamical jahn - teller effect .",
    "below the spin - orbital ordering temperature ( @xmath21 k ) , super - exchange and spin - orbit interaction screen the jahn - teller effect and at @xmath58 the tetragonal symmetry is recovered .",

    "<S> using high resolution x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) on high purity powders , we resolved the structure and @xmath0 symmetry of the intriguing compound sr@xmath1vo@xmath2@xmath3 from room temperature down to 20 k to an unprecedented level of accuracy . upon cooling , </S>",
    "<S> this new set of data unambiguously reveals a second order phase transition lowering the symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic at a temperature @xmath4 k. the observation of an orthorhombic distortion of the @xmath0-plane is attributed to nematic phase formation supported by local jahn - teller ( jt ) dynamical instability . at @xmath5 k , spins order and at @xmath6 k the tetragonal structure is recovered with an elongated c - axis . </S>"
