    "the mechanical exfoliation of graphene @xcite from graphite has resulted in an enormous interest in this two - dimensional monolayer of hexagonal ordered carbon atoms which is due to its unique electronic , optical and mechanical properties @xcite that is expected to lead to potential applications in different areas of electronics , opto - electronics , etc .",
    "a material of even more current technological importance is silicon .",
    "it has been a longstanding debate , dating back to the pioneering work of yin and cohen,@xcite whether or not graphitic",
    "si is stable . using pseudopotential local - density - functional theory they doubted that the formation of graphitic si is possible because its energy is 0.71 ev / atom higher than the diamond phase and that a large negative pressure of -69 kbar is needed to stabilize it .",
    "even before the exfoliation of graphene in 2004 several theoretical works @xcite have predicted that free - standing single - layer silicon , called silicene,@xcite is stable .",
    "sp@xmath0 hybridization leads to a flat layer , which in silicene is unfavorable with respect to a buckled si(111 ) honeycomb structure with sp@xmath1 hybridization .",
    "the electronic structure has been shown to be similar to graphene that is characterized by a zero gap and a dirac cone low energy spectrum .",
    "a unique feature of silicene is its large spin - orbit interaction @xcite that is predicted to result in quantum spin hall effect,@xcite electrically tunable band gap @xcite and the emergence of a valley - polarized metal phase.@xcite    recently there has been very active experimental research on the synthesis of silicene .",
    "a versatility of different silicene - like crystallographic structures were obtained on different substrates , e.g. ag,@xcite zrb@xmath2,@xcite ir,@xcite)depending on the growth conditions and the particular arrangement of the substrate atoms .",
    "these phases were found to be different from the theoretical predicted buckled configuration of freestanding silicene which are a consequence of the interaction with the substrate and the induced epitaxial strain .",
    "furthermore , there is yet no definite proof that these silicene like structures exhibit a zero gap with a dirac cone electronic spectrum.@xcite up to now no freestanding silicene has been fabricated and there is serious doubt that such a structure is even stable in nature . here",
    "we propose that alternatively , one can insert silicene between two substrates that interact very weakly with the si atoms , in order to stabilize it .",
    "we show that once intercalated into the bilayer graphene ( either through domain boundaries or vacancy defects in graphene layers @xcite ) , the silicon atoms can be stabilized to planar ( with small buckling ) silicon clusters during thermal annealing , which can serve as building blocks for a silicene sheet .",
    "it has been shown in recent density functional theory ( dft ) calculations that silicene layer strengthens the interlayer binding between the graphene sheets as compared to that in graphite without altering the other properties of graphene like the dirac fermion - like electronic structure.@xcite    in this work we conduct a systematic study of the structural properties and the thermal stability of si atoms intercalating bilayer graphene using reactive molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , which are supported by density functional tight - binding theory ( dftb).@xcite we found that energetically unfavorable planar silicon clusters in free space can be stabilized to slightly buckled honeycomb structures by the weak confinement due to the induced straining in the graphene layers .",
    "these quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) si clusters are found to be different from those of silicene over an ag substrate @xcite and are stable beyond room temperature . at higher temperature they transit to three - dimensional ( 3d ) diamond - like structures with predominant sp@xmath1 hybridization .",
    "since such structures can naturally arise during epitaxial growth of few - layer graphene on bulk silicon carbide ( sic ) by thermal decomposition  @xcite , our findings can be useful in the understanding of the mechanisms for synthesis of multilayer graphene on sic.@xcite the results may also initiate further research on graphene - silicene superlattice structures with promising structural and electronic properties .",
    "recently , it has been proposed @xcite that analogous to graphene @xcite hydrogenation of silicene clusters maybe a promising route for hydrogen storage .",
    "to study the structural ( thermal ) properties of silicene , md simulations were performed using the reactive force - field reaxff , which , in contrast to classical force - fields , is a general bond - order dependent potential that accounts for bond breaking and bond formation during chemical reactions.@xcite the system connectivity is recalculated at every iteration step and non - bounded interactions ( van der waals and coulomb ) are calculated between all atom pairs , irrespective of their connectivity.@xcite since reaxff parameters are derived from quantum chemical calculations , it gives energies , transition states , reaction pathways and reactivity trends in agreement with quantum mechanical calculations and experiments.@xcite numerical simulations are carried out using the lammps code  @xcite which includes the reaxff method.@xcite in order to have an independent test of our used model we performed extra calculations using dftb / md  @xcite .",

    "we present now a systematic study of the structural properties of si atoms inserted between the graphene layers .",
    "such intercalation can occur e.g. through domain boundaries or defect areas in the graphene layer.@xcite here we report only the energetically most favorable configurations out of the many possible metastable configurations ( including 3d si clusters ) which we investigated . as a representative example",
    ", we consider ab stacked bilayer graphene ( with 960 carbon atoms in each layer , corresponding to a computational unit cell of 5.31@xmath45.01 nm@xmath0 in the @xmath5-plane ) with periodic boundary conditions along the graphene basal planes in order to avoid edge effects . the formation energies of si clusters are calculated as:@xcite @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the total energy of the system , @xmath8 is the number of atoms in the cluster , @xmath9 ev is the cohesive energy of si , and @xmath10 is the energy of bilayer graphene .",
    "we start by considering a single silicon atom adsorbed on top of bilayer graphene , the equilibrium structure of which is shown in fig .",

    "the si atom is adsorbed at bridge site forming a covalent bond ( above the middle of the carbon - carbon bonds ) with bond distance @xmath11 and formation energy of 1.1 ev .",
    "such bridge site attachment was recently predicted using first principles calculations with binding energy of 1.17 ev and si - c distance in the range @xmath12.@xcite si attachment induces a small local change in the underlaying planar graphene [ see right panel of fig . [ fig1](a ) ] where the carbon - carbon distance increases to @xmath13 , which is very close to the dft prediction ( @xmath14).@xcite this result is also very different from the assumed hollow side positioning of the si atoms between graphene layers proposed in ref .",

    "figure [ fig1](b ) shows the ground state configuration of the system when the si atom is inserted between the layers .",
    "this si atom is located at equal distance from both layers and results in considerable local expansion and buckling of the layers .",
    "the interlayer distance of bilayer graphene without intercalating bilayer graphene is 3.29@xmath15 .",
    "the local deformation of the graphene layers ( in this particular case about 50% ) explains the considerable enhancement of the formation energy as compared to the case when the si atom is adsorbed on top of bilayer graphene .",
    "@xmath16 decreases more than twice by the formation of a silicon dimer [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ] , which is also located in the middle of the interplanar spacing and weakly van der waals bonded with the graphene layers .",
    "a triangular cluster is found in the ground state for @xmath8=3 as in the case of si@xmath17 on a metallic surface.@xcite .",
    "all three si atoms are located at the center of the hexagonal ring of the lower graphene layer and right below the carbon atom of the upper layer , i.e. , so called the `` h - t '' site [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](d)].@xcite such energy - minimum locations between the layers are observed for larger si clusters [ see figs .",

    "notice that line structures observed for free standing carbon clusters c@xmath3 with @xmath18 ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) are found to be metastable in case of si clusters .",
    "figure [ fig1](g ) shows the equilibrium state of si@xmath19 , which is the building block for silicene . adding one si atom to it results in the si@xmath20 cluster which shows ( fig . [ fig1](h ) ) a planar ring structure with different si interatomic distances .",
    "the reason is that the si atoms try to accommodate the graphene matrix .",
    "the single ring structure becomes energetically less stable with further increasing @xmath8 , and a double ring structure is found for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as shown in figs .",

    "note that the formation energy decreases almost monotonically by increasing the number @xmath8 of si atoms in the cluster .",

    "however , the buckling is not constant across the cluster : it is larger in the middle of the cluster and decreases towards the edges . as in the case of metal supported si clusters @xcite , the formation energy of si@xmath3 clusters decreases as the cluster size increases .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) , we have a predetermined hexagonal arrangement of si atoms .",
    "however , in a real experiments si atoms may intercalate between the graphene layers only at high temperatures ( above 1000 k),@xcite where silicene is predicted to be unstable.@xcite thus the interesting question in this case is what happens to the si cluster when temperature is rapidly quenched .",
    "to model this situation , we conducted the following simulations : first , we initialized the si atoms randomly far from each other , then increased temperature gradually ( 20 k / ps ) from 0 to 2000 k. during this process si atoms start migrating ( due to their small migration barrier  @xcite ) and forms a 3d - like cluster at high temperatures , as shown in fig .",

    "<S> the confinement between the flat graphene layers results in a planar clustering of si atoms with small buckling , which is energetically unfavorable in vacuum . buckled hexagonal arrangement of si atoms similar to free - standing silicene is observed for large clusters , which , in contrast to si atoms on metallic surfaces , is only very weakly van der waals coupled to the graphene layers . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters are found to be stable well above room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our findings , which are supported by density functional tight - binding calculations , show that intercalating bilayer graphene with si is a favorable route to realize silicene . </S>"
