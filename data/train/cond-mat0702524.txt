    "is a broad class of macroscopic ordering phenomena that have been called ",
    "purely - noise - induced \" because order is exhibited only in the presence of noise .",
    "these include order - disorder transitions  @xcite , the emergence of periodic spatial structures and pattern formation in increasingly noisy systems  @xcite , and , more recently , purely noise - induced collective oscillatory behavior  @xcite .",
    "purely noise - induced phase transitions to oscillatory behavior may be dynamically induced and dependent on the stratonovich drift , i.e. , on the interpretation of the noise  @xcite , or it may occur in systems with field dependent relaxational dynamics where the interpretation of the noise at most shifts the transition points  @xcite .",
    "the particular novelty of the latter transition lies in the fact that it arises entirely from an energy functional - like relaxational dynamics , and not from short - time dynamic instabilities which become strengthened and sustained by spatial coupling . as such",
    ", these models represent systems that , while decidedly nonequilibrium and potentially time - dependent in nature , nevertheless maintain certain parallels with equilibrium statistical models , namely the evolution towards the minimum of a ( possibly time - dependent ) effective potential .",
    "our focus in this paper is on phase transitions in systems with field dependent relaxational dynamics .",
    "analytic work on these models has been fairly limited , with most of the information coming from numerical simulations .",
    "we are not aware of solvable analytic theories for locally coupled ( e.g. nearest neighbor ) noisy extended systems in which any sort of ordering transition is observed as the system or noise parameters are varied .",
    "globally coupled arrays have been more amenable to mean field theories based on the analytic solution of a fokker - planck equation in the stationary state .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to systems that achieve a time - independent steady state .",
    "such mean field theories provide information about the nature of the steady state and the conditions that lead to disordered vs ordered states .",
    "thus , while quite useful for ascertaining asymptotic properties , these static theories provide no insight into the dynamical evolution toward a steady state .",
    "such insight is particularly important in multistable systems .",
    "most strikingly , these theories fail to provide even a reasonable asymptotic description of phase transitions to collective time - dependent behavior , when the complexity of the corresponding fokker - planck equation prohibits a self - consistent analytical treatment  @xcite even in globally coupled arrays .",
    "the complicated behavior seen , for example , in the transition to noise - induced limit cycles thus requires different methods for analytic study  @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to provide an approximate analytical method supplementary to the mean field approach for studying the dynamics of noise - induced phase transitions in relaxational systems inspired by a related quantum field method @xcite . by introducing a gaussian ansatz and a series expansion about the ( time - dependent ) mean field values",
    ", we develop a time - dependent theory which captures the dynamics of these systems in the limit of strong spatial coupling . as well as providing new analytical insight into the evolution to the steady state in one - field systems , this treatment yields a set of simple approximate ordinary differential equations detailing the oscillatory dynamics and the approach to these dynamics in two - field systems .",
    "we note that an alternative approach to the one adopted in this paper is to generalize the procedure developed in @xcite that gives a set of differential equations for the central moments .",
    "it can be shown that this alternative approach gives the same results at leading order for large coupling as the gaussian ansatz , we are preparing a manuscript where we show the details of the comparison .",
