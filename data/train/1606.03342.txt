    "it is interesting to study the isoperimetric problem : among all sets of a given measure find a set with the smallest boundary measure .",
    "in other words , we want to find a set which measure grows the slowest among all sets of a given measure .",
    "such a set is said to be _",
    "extremal_.    this problem seems to be difficult in general and the solution to it is known only in a few cases . if @xmath9 is the lebesgue measure in the @xmath10-dimensional euclidean space , then balls are extremal sets .",
    "this follows for example by the brunn - minkowski inequality and can be proven in many other ways ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ) .",
    "lvy @xcite and schmidt @xcite proved that the extremal sets with respect to the haar measure on the @xmath10-dimensional sphere equipped with the geodesic metric are balls in the geodesic metric , i.e. the intersections of half - spaces in @xmath11 with the sphere .",
    "another example of the full solution to the isoperimetric problem is the gaussian measure in the euclidean space @xmath12 , i.e. the product measure with the density @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the euclidean norm in @xmath12 .",
    "borell @xcite and sudakov with tsirelson @xcite proved that in this case half - spaces @xmath15 are extremal .",
    "as bobkov and houdr proved in @xcite , on the real line this result can be generalized into the case of an arbitrary symmetric log - concave measure .",
    "bobkov @xcite also studied the isoperimetric problem in the product metric space @xmath16 equipped with a product probability measure , where @xmath17 . in this case , if the extremal sets in @xmath18 are of the form @xmath19 and @xmath4 are extremal in @xmath20 , then @xmath21 are extremal in @xmath22 .    the discrete version of the isoperimetric problem on the cube @xmath23 ( with the uniform measure and the hamming distance ) was considered by harper in @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , he showed that balls in the hamming distance are extremal .",
    "this was generalized to sets @xmath24 ( instead of @xmath23 ) by wang and wang in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , that once we know the solution to the isoperimetric problem , we can obtain concentration properties for the measure @xmath2 ( see for example chapter 2.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is probably the most difficult way to derive concentration inequalities , since it relies on finding the exact value of the isoperimetric function ( and the sets which achieve the smallest boundary measure ) , not only a reasonable estimate on it .    in this note",
    "we will find the extremal sets in the case of the exponential measure on the plane with @xmath0-metric .",
