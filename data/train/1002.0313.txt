    "the nuclear matter symmetry energy , which is defined as the difference in energy per nucleon between the pure neutron matter and the symmetric nuclear matter , is an important quantity that determines the properties of objects such as the atomic nucleus and the neutron star @xcite .",
    "the study of symmetry energy and its dependence on nuclear density and temperature is currently a subject of great interest @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the symmetry energy can be determined from microscopic calculations such as the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) and the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) calculations , or the phenomenological calculations such as the skyrme hartree - fock ( shf ) and the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) calculations @xcite .",
    "these calculations currently predict wide range of symmetry energies for densities below and above normal nuclear density , @xmath0 = 0.16 @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . experimentally , the symmetry energy is not a directly measurable quantity and has to be extracted indirectly from observables that are related to the symmetry energy .",
    "the experimental determination of the symmetry energy is therefore dependent on how reliable the model that describes the experimental observable is .",
    "so far there has been very few experimental determination of the symmetry energy .",
    "these experimental studies are of two types :    1 .   where , a certain form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy is assumed in the theoretical calculation and the experimental observable reproduced using the dependence that best explains the data .",
    "such studies @xcite often make use of dynamical models such as , the isospin boltzmann uehling uhlenbech ( ibuu04 ) @xcite , the improved quantum molecular dynamics ( imqmd ) @xcite , the boltzmann nordheim vlasov ( bnv ) transport calculation @xcite and the anti symmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite , to relate the symmetry energy to the experimental observable .",
    "the disadvantage in such studies is that they assume a single form of the symmetry energy for all densities , which may not be true .",
    "such studies provide only a gross dependence of the symmetry energy without much insight into its evolution with the density . also , these studies are highly model dependent as will be discussed in a later section .",
    "where , the form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy is not known a priori and the symmetry energy is studied by mapping its value at each density .",
    "such studies @xcite require a detailed understanding of the relation between the symmetry energy , excitation energy , density and temperature .",
    "they make use of the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite to relate the symmetry energy to the experimental observable .",
    "the advantage in such studies is that they provide a  direct \" means of studying the symmetry energy with density and temperature that can then be compared with any theoretical predictions .",
    "the difficulty in such studies is often the theoretical interpretation of the symmetry energy .",
    ".,width=5,height=2 ]    in this article , we review recent experimental studies on the symmetry energy and its density dependence obtained using the above two approaches .",
    "the symmetry energy below saturation density has been studied in heavy ion multifragmentation reactions using fragments with a @xmath6 4 .",
    "observables such as the fragment yield , isoscaling parameter , isospin diffusion transport ratio , double neutron - proton ratio , pre - equilibrium emission , and @xmath7n@xmath8/z has been used to extract the symmetry energy .",

    "the functional dependence of the symmetry energy obtained from all these comparisons are very similar to each other .",
    "it must be mentioned that while both the ibuu04 and imqmd comparisons lead to similar form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy for the isospin diffusion observable , the ibuu04 fails to adaquately explain the neutron to proton ratio @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these comparisons lead to very different results for densities above saturation density @xcite ( as discussed in section 5 ) .",
    "the determination of the symmetry energy from the dynamical model comparison is therefore highly model dependent , and the assumption of a single form of the symmetry energy at different densities questionable .",
    "the symmetry energy has also been studied by comparing the experimental observables with the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) calculation @xcite in this density region . in multifragmentation a nucleus expands with increasing excitation energy and its equilibrium density is reduced from the ground state density .",
    "such a decrease should essentially map the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "a detailed understanding of the relationship between excitation energy , density , and temperature is however required . an attempt has recently been made by shetty _",

    "they observed that a reduced value of the symmetry energy from 25 mev to 14 mev is essential for explaining the data .",
    "they further showed that fragments with z @xmath6 6 are even more sensitive to the variation in symmetry energy and can be an important probe for studying symmetry energy .",
    "a decrease in the symmetry energy was also implied by wuenschel _",
    "@xcite , in the study of @xmath24kr + @xmath25ni reactions at 35 mev / a .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the decrease in the symmetry energy to reproduce the experimental observables in these studies may not be necessary if the surface corrections to the symmetry energy are included in the mass parameterization used in the smm model calculation .",
    "the possibility of modification of the symmetry energy and the surface energy coefficient of nuclear matter was studied recently by ogul _",
    "they found that the isoscaling parameters are affected very little by the surface energy variation and are very sensitive to the symmetry energy .",

    "they observed that the experimental symmetry energy is somewhat higher than those expected from the mean field calculations . at such low densities cluster formation",

    "this parameterization is in good agreement with the mean field calculation . in the density region , @xmath5 @xmath29 @xmath2 @xmath3 , the experimental symmetry energy is observed to deviate from the mean field calculation due to the importance of cluster formation , and is in good agreement with the quantum statistic calculation @xcite .",

    "at densities higher than the normal nuclear matter density the theoretically determined symmetry energy as a function of density is largely unconstrained",
    ". experimental determination of the symmetry energy at such densities have been very few and they are all from dynamical model comparison .",
    "the results are highly model dependent and contradicting .",
    "one observable that has recently been studied is the @xmath35@xmath36@xmath37 ratio in @xmath14ca + @xmath14ca , @xmath38ru + @xmath38ru , @xmath38zr + @xmath38zr and @xmath16au + @xmath16au reactions at gsi by the fopi collaboration @xcite .",
    "a comparison @xcite of this data with the transport model ibuu04 calculation shows that it can be reproduced with a  soft \" ( x = 1 ) form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "this is in contrast to those obtained from the low density studies of the symmetry energy where a  stiff \" ( x = 0 ) form of the symmetry energy reproduced the data well .",
    "more recently , the @xmath35@xmath36@xmath37 gsi data was also compared with the imqmd calculation by feng _ et al . _ @xcite .",
    "the comparison favored a much stiffer form of the symmetry energy than those obtained from the low density studies , and in direct contradiction to those obtained from the ibuu04 model comparison .",
    "the symmetry energy results at such high densities is therefore currently controversial .",
    "another observable that has been suggested for probing the high density behavior of the symmetry energy is the relative and differential collective flow between triton and @xmath39he particles @xcite .",
    "preliminary calculation by yong _",
    "@xcite , suggests that a  stiff \" ( x = 0 ) dependence of the symmetry energy would lead to a linear behavior for the relative flow , whereas thesoft \" ( x = 1 ) dependence would give a non linear behavior with appreciable difference between the two .",
    "so it is expected that a measurement of this observable should provide important information on the high density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "the theoretical determination of the symmetry energy at high density is a challenge .",
    "it is not known how reliable the dynamical model calculations can be at such high densities as it is not known how the quantum many body effects can be treated in these calculations , or how the effects of spin@xmath31isospin for three body force can be included . also , the nuclear matter at such densities is not in a pure nucleonic state at thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "the above comparison with the experimental data is therefore only a `` circumstantial '' evidence @xcite and much theoretical work needs to be done before a definitive conclusion can be reached .",
    "the symmetry energy of finite nuclei at saturation density is often extracted by fitting ground state masses with various versions of the liquid drop mass formula . for a finite nuclei",
    "it is important to decompose the symmetry term of liquid into bulk ( volume ) and surface contributions , and identify the volume symmetry energy coefficient as the symmetry energy derived from the nuclear matter at saturation density . using the constraint obtained from the above studies on nuclear matter symmetry energy , the symmetry energy of a finite nucleus of mass @xmath40 , @xmath41 ,",
    "can be written as @xcite ,    @xmath42}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath19 = 31 - 33 mev , @xmath13 = 0.5 - 0.7 and @xmath43 = 2.6 - 3.0 .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the volume and the surface symmetry energy at normal nuclear density . presently , the values of @xmath19 , @xmath13 and @xmath43 remain unconstrained .",
    "the ratio of the volume symmetry energy to the surface symmetry energy ( @xmath43 ) , is closely related to the neutron skin thickness @xcite . depending upon how the nuclear surface and the coulomb contribution is treated , two different correlations between the volume and the surface symmetry energy have been predicted @xcite from fits to nuclear masses .",
    "experimental masses and neutron skin thickness measurements for nuclei with @xmath44 @xmath6 1 should provide tighter constraint on the above parameters .    the above relation for the symmetry energy of finite nuclei has been compared @xcite with the thomas - fermi calculation of samaddar _ et al .",
    "it was observed that this empirical relation compares very well with the thomas - fermi calculation for wide range of nuclei .",
    "future measurements of symmetry energy as a function of excitation energy for very light and heavy nuclei should provide further insight into the validity of this relation .",
    "currently , studies on the density dependence of the symmetry energy are being carried out using beams of stable nuclei . in order to study large isospin dependency beams of neutron - rich nuclei",
    "are needed . a number of observables sensitive to the symmetry energy that can be experimentally tested has been sugggested by di toro _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that future facilities for rare isotope beams such as frib , fair and spiral ii should provide increased precision in the measurement of symmetry energy using these observables over a wide range of density .",
    "these facilities will allow studies to be carried out at 2 - 3 times the normal nuclear density .",
    "new detectors such as the time projection chamber ( tpc ) at nscl@xmath36msu and the time projection chamber , samurai at riken@xmath36japan are therefore being planned to study the symmetry energy and the nuclear equation of state .",
    "these detectors will significantly enhance our understanding of the nuclear symmetry energy and their relation to atomic nuclei and neutron stars .",
    "in summary , the experimental determination of the nuclear symmetry energy is reviewed .",
    "it is observed that despite the model dependent ways in which the symmetry energy is extracted significant progress has been made .",
    "these studies are the first step in an effort to constrain the symmetry energy that is important for studying the structure of neutrons stars and exotic nuclei . in the future",
    ", it is hoped that more measurements will be carried out where the symmetry energy is extracted for each densities and compared with theoretical calculations .",
    "these measurements using beams of neutron rich nuclei and robust theoretical interpretation of the symmetry energy will help refine some of these results .",
    "furthermore , they will help constrain the symmetry energy at densities above normal nuclear density where experimental results are scarce .",
