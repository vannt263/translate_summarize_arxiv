    "tunneling of electrons in nanostructures is strongly affected by coulomb repulsion . in systems containing metallic tunnel junctions",
    "the interaction can be described by the charging energy @xcite @xmath1 expressed in terms of a geometrical capacitance @xmath2 . for weak tunneling and temperatures well below @xmath3 ,",
    "tunneling is suppressed by the coulomb blockade effect .",
    "this regime is well explored experimentally @xcite , and the phenomena observed can be explained theoretically @xcite by means of perturbation theory in the tunneling strength which is characterized by the classical high temperature tunneling conductance @xmath4 .",
    "this approach breaks down for conductances comparable to or even larger than the conductance quantum @xmath5 .",
    "when using these devices , e.g.  as highly sensitive electrometers @xcite , in detectors @xcite , or for thermometry @xcite , a large current signal is desirable meaning large tunneling conductance .",
    "however , higher order processes such as cotunneling @xcite lead to a smearing of coulomb blockade phenomena and a compromise must be found in practice .",
    "while the strong tunneling regime has been explored extensively by recent experiments @xcite , theoretical predictions remain limited .",
    "the theoretical work roughly splits into two groups . on the one hand , higher order perturbative results @xcite were successful in explaining some of the recent experimental data , yet , the analysis typically is restricted to conductances at most of order @xmath6 .",
    "based on the diagrammatic expansion , partial resummation techniques were used to obtain nonperturbative results @xcite , however , for a restricted set of charge states .",
    "the arbitrary cutoff necessary in these latter theories limits their use for direct comparison with experimental findings .",
    "further progress can be made by using perturbative renormalization group techniques @xcite .",
    "apart from these approaches based on diagrams generated by treating tunneling as a perturbation , a formally exact path integral expression @xcite including all orders in the tunneling conductance may serve as a starting point for analytical predictions @xcite and numerical calculations @xcite . while perturbation theory in the tunneling term usually starts from states with definite electric charge , this latter approach employs the canonically conjugate phase variable and thus is well adapted to situations where the charge is smeared by thermal or quantum fluctuations . in this work we use the path integral approach to determine the linear conductance of single electron devices in the semiclassical limit .",
    "some limiting cases of the results presented here were published in short form previously @xcite . here",
    "we give a fuller account of the approach and apply it to a larger variety of systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the hamiltonians of a tunnel junction and of the electromagnetic environment , respectively .",
    "we then explain the general method of calculating the linear conductance from the kubo formula with the help of a generating functional . in sec .",
    "iii the case of a single tunnel junction embedded in an electromagnetic environment of arbitrary impedance is considered .",
    "we use this example to derive the effective action characterizing the generating functional which is employed also in subsequent sections with adequate generalizations .",
    "we evaluate the conductance in the semiclassical limit appropriate for high temperatures and/or large tunneling conductance and compare the results with experimental findings by joyez _",
