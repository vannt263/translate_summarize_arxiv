    "in hard condensed matter systems , the structure of the crystalline states that are formed is largely determined by the strength of the bonds between the atoms or molecules in the system , the dependence of the bonds on the orientation of the particles and the packing of the particles . in general , thermal fluctuations and entropy",
    "are less important , unless one considers a system near the melting transition .",
    "in contrast , entropy and temperature can be all - important in determining the structure of soft matter systems .",
    "for polymers in solution , the interactions between pairs of chains depend on a delicate balance between energy and entropy @xcite . when the solvent is good , the polymer chains form an open structure and interactions between pairs of polymers are largely repulsive and entropic in origin . on the other hand ,",
    "when the solvent is less good , the polymer exhibits a tendency to collapse . in a good solvent ,",
    "the strength of the repulsion depends on how branched the polymer is . as a result",
    "the form of the effective interaction between polymers can be tailored and controlled via the polymer architecture . in star - polymers , for example",
    ", the effective interaction potential is determined by the number of arms on each star @xcite .",
    "the effective interaction between soft polymeric macromolecules is also soft .",
    "since the centres of mass need not coincide with any particular monomer , the effective interaction potential between the centres of mass can actually be finite for all values of the separation distance @xmath0 between the centres . in this paper",
    "we discuss the structure , phase behavior and dynamics of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) model system of such soft core particles .",
    "the model that we study consists of soft particles which have a ` core ' plus ` corona ' ( or shoulder ) architecture .",
    "the particles interact via the following pair potential : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the diameter of the cores of the particles , and @xmath3 is the diameter of the corona ( or shoulder ) of the particles .",
    "in addition to the two length scales present in the potential , there are two energy scales : the energy penalty for a pair of particle cores to overlap is @xmath4 and the energy penalty for just the coronas to overlap is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a dimensionless parameter that determines the shoulder repulsion strength .",
    "the particular form of the pair potential in eq .   arises from considering the effective interaction between the centres of mass of certain dendrimers or star - polymers . for dendrimers",
    ", this potential applies if the inner generations of monomers are of one kind ( hydrophobic , say ) , while the outer generations are of another kind ( hydrophilic , say ) .",
    "similarly , if a star polymer is made of diblock copolymers , then with a suitable choice of the block length ratio , the effective interaction potential between the centres of mass is expected to be of the form in eq .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] we display the phase diagram for a system with temperature @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the figure shows the @xmath9 plane , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the average number of particles in area @xmath12 .",
    "this phase diagram is determined using density functional theory ( dft ) , which is described below . ref .",
    "@xcite provides a brief account of some of the work elaborated here . at low densities @xmath13 the particles",
    "form a liquid state . however , as the density increases , the particles overlap and then freeze to form one of two different crystalline states .",
    "the crystals are unusual : they are of the so - called ` cluster - crystal ' variety  @xcite , related to the fact that the particles have a soft core . in the cluster - crystal multiple particles",
    "occupy each lattice site .",
    "when the parameter @xmath14 , the system reduces to particles interacting via a simple soft potential with one length scale and one energy scale .",
    "this is the generalized exponential model with exponent @xmath15 , or gem-8 model fluid  @xcite . in 2d , at the temperatures relevant here , this model exhibits just one hexagonal crystal phase , with lattice spacing @xmath16 that is approximately constant with increasing density ( note that at very low temperatures , a series of isostructural phase transitions is expected @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , when @xmath17 the contribution from the core of the potential becomes negligible and the fluid is again approximately a gem-8 system , but now the particles have the larger diameter @xmath18 and a stronger repulsion energy .",
    "thus , for large @xmath6 , the system forms a hexagonal crystal with lattice spacing @xmath19 .",
    "we henceforth refer to this larger lattice spacing crystal as the ` crystal a ' phase , and the smaller lattice spacing crystal as the ` crystal b ' phase .",
    "plane , where @xmath13 is the average density .",
    "the system exhibits three phases : a liquid and two crystalline phases .",
    "the ` crystal a ' is hexagonal , with a large lattice spacing , while ` crystal b ' , which is also hexagonal , has a smaller lattice spacing .",
    "the small - dashed blue line is the linear instability threshold ( spinodal ) for the uniform liquid .",
    "the large - dashed green horizontal line is where the two principal peaks in the static structure factor @xmath20 have the same height , while the pink dotted line terminating in a circle is the locus where the two peaks in the dispersion relation @xmath21 have equal height .",
    "the circle marks the point where the smaller @xmath22 peak disappears . ]    when the difference @xmath23 is small , one can pass smoothly from one crystal phase to the other as @xmath6 is varied ( i.e. , there is only one crystalline phase ) .",
    "however , when the difference is larger , as in the case displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] , crystal a and crystal b are two distinct phases separated by a phase transition at @xmath24 . , since the ratio @xmath25 needs to be greater than this value for there to be a point on the linear instability threshold line where there are two modes that are unstable ( i.e.  the point in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] where the dotted and dashed lines meet ) . ] indeed , many of the interesting novel properties of the present model described below all occur in the regime when @xmath24 , because they stem from the competition between the two different length scales , @xmath2 and @xmath18 , and the two different energy scales , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "two of the most striking properties of this system are : ( i ) when quenched to certain regions of the phase diagram , where @xmath24 , the system can sometimes freeze to form states with quasicrystalline order .",
    "( ii ) on examining in detail the crystal a phase , again when @xmath24 , we find that there is a high proportion of mobile particles in the system , which is why we refer to this phase as a ` crystal - liquid ' .",
    "it is crystalline , because the majority of the particles in the system are frozen onto a regular hexagonal lattice .",
    "however , a minority are ` liquid ' , in the sense that they move throughout the system .",
    "we find that the proportion of mobile particles in the system can be as high as  7% .",
    "the quasicrystals ( qcs ) formed by the present system are a local equilibrium state of the system , i.e. , they are not the global minimum free energy state .",
    "they are found at state points in the portion of the phase diagram where the thermodynamic equilibrium phase is the crystal - liquid a state .",
    "the qcs are formed by a particular dynamic mechanism when the system is quenched to certain regions of the phase diagram .    in order to find parameter values at",
    "which qcs might be favored , we have invoked understanding developed from analyzing mode interactions in the faraday wave experiment , in which a tray of liquid is subjected to vertical vibrations of sufficient amplitude that standing waves form on the surface .",
    "this system exhibits quasipatterns ( the fluid dynamical analogue of quasicrystals ) , as discovered in the early 1990 s  @xcite , and two different mechanisms for their formation have been identified ( see  @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "briefly , patterns with @xmath28-fold symmetry are expressed as sums of modes with @xmath28  wavevectors spaced at equal angles , and weakly nonlinear theory is used to compute how waves with different orientations affect each other .",
    "one mechanism relies on strong self - coupling to downplay the effect of waves with different orientations  @xcite , so permitting 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20-fold or higher quasipatterns @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism invokes nonlinear coupling between the primary waves with secondary weakly damped ( or weakly excited ) waves , such that primary waves with wavevectors separated by a certain angle determined by the ratio of the primary to secondary wavenumber , are favored  @xcite .",
    "we invoke here this second mechanism , as done in  @xcite , and select the length scale ratio for our investigation to be @xmath8 ( sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] ) in order that the ratio of the primary to secondary wavenumbers is @xmath29 , so favoring dodecagonal quasicrystals .",
    "in fact the mechanism for qc formation that we actually observe differs from either of the two mechanisms described above .",
    "the qcs form when the uniform liquid is linearly unstable against density fluctuations with a small wavelength that is close to that of the lattice spacing of the crystal b phase but stable with respect to wavelengths comparable to that of crystal a. thus , in the initial stages after a quench the system appears to be forming the crystal b phase . however , the minimum free energy structure is actually the larger lattice spacing crystal a phase . in the subsequent _ nonlinear _ evolution ,",
    "the system seeks to form this larger lattice - spacing phase .",
    "however , being already patterned with the shorter length scale from the early stage linear dynamics , the system can not always form a perfect crystal a and often forms a state with a mixture of both the short and long length scales that sometimes turns out to have quasicrystalline ordering , i.e. , the fourier transform of the density distribution reveals the presence of 12-fold ordering .",
    "as one might expect from such a mechanism , the structure that is formed contains defects .",
    "however , by carefully controlling the wave numbers of the density modulations prior to the quench , the system can be induced to form a ` perfect ' quasicrystal .",
    "understanding the mechanisms by which soft matter qcs can form is becoming increasingly important .",
    "the possibility of designing soft - matter quasicrystals that self - assemble has generated considerable interest at a fundamental level , leading to a burst of experimental and theoretical activity  @xcite .",
    "self - assembled soft - matter quasicrystals are of interest for a number of reasons , not least because they promise to provide a route to manufacturing materials and coatings with novel optical or electronic properties arising as a consequence of their high degree of rotation symmetry  @xcite .",
    "although our focus is on polymeric soft matter qcs , we should also mention that there are other ( colloidal ) soft matter systems that form qcs @xcite .",
    "these also have pair potentials involving more than one length scale , but owing to the particles having a hard core , the local structure of these materials differs from that described below , as does the resulting phase behavior .",

    "in this paper we have elaborated on the results of ref .",

    "the subtle balance of these leads to rich structuring and phase behavior .",
    "pair potentials with these qualities arise as the effective interaction potentials between polymeric macromolecules . in particular , we believe that tailoring dendrimers with a ` core ' plus ` shell ' architecture should yield particles with effective interaction potentials akin to those considered here .",
    "of course , the model system considered here is two - dimensional , so to observe the particular behavior reported here in an experimental system , the particles must be confined to an interface in order to create an effectively two - dimensional system . the natural next step to take after the work described here is to consider systems in three dimensions , where the phase behavior and the structures observed will be even richer .",
    "we are now embarking on work in this direction .",
    "the two most striking aspects of the present model are : ( i ) the formation of the crystal - liquid phase , having two dynamically distinct populations of particles , some that are confined to the crystal lattice sites and others that are mobile , residing in a honeycomb - like network around the main density peaks .",
    "( ii ) the formation of qcs .",
    "this aspect is particularly interesting , because the qc structures form via a mechanism that is distinct from any of the mechanisms that have been proposed previously .",
    "namely , qc formation occurs following a deep quench of the uniform liquid to state points where it is unstable . at these state points",
    ", the global minimum of free energy corresponds to the large length scale crystal a phase .",
    "however , in the initial linear growth regime after the quench , a smaller length scale ( corresponding to the small - length crystal b phase ) grows the fastest , leading to the system becoming patterned with the `` wrong '' small - wavelength density modulations .",
    "when the system subsequently seeks to lower its free energy and hence to introduce the longer length scale , it remains `` stuck '' with some ordering on the small length scale .",
    "the final equilibrium structure generally consists of a mixture of the two length scales and may exhibit qc ordering , i.e. , the fourier transform may consist of a ring of 12 peaks .",
    "the resulting structure is in fact a local minimum of the free energy , but not the global minimum .",
    "the qcs formed via such a mechanism are , unsurprisingly , generally disordered , containing a mixture of domains with 12-fold ordering and domains of hexagonal ordering , corresponding to one or other of the two hexagonal crystal structures .    the results presented here are for just one temperature . however , the important quantities for determining the phase behavior of the model are the dimensionless quantities @xmath175 , @xmath6 and @xmath25 .",
    "varying these determines the location in the phase diagram of the linear instability threshold , the point where both length scales are marginally unstable and the ratio @xmath176 . in the limit @xmath14 ,",
    "increasing @xmath175 shifts the linear instability threshold to higher density @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "varying the temperature by a modest amount should leave the behavior of the present system qualitatively unchanged , merely shifting the regions where the crystalline phases occur to higher densities .",
    "it is worth connecting the present work with related work @xcite on the freezing of binary mixtures of particles .",
    "the mixtures considered in refs .",
    "@xcite also possess two length scales , owing to the fact that they are a binary mixture of soft particles of different sizes , and form multiple structures when a solidification front advances into an unstable uniform liquid . for a deep enough quench ,",
    "such a front deposits behind it density modulations that are also of the `` wrong '' wavelength , thereby frustrating the formation of a well - ordered `` correct '' wavelength equilibrium crystal . in particular , the final equilibrium structures also contain a high degree of disorder . in this case , the selection of the `` wrong '' wavelength is due to the dynamical nature of the length scale selection problem via an advancing front : the selected wavelength depends only on the linearization , whereas the global minimum free energy crystal structure is determined by the full dft , which is highly nonlinear .",
    "this situation differs from the qc formation observed in the present work , yet there are similarities : both systems undergo a linear process that generates modulations with a length scale that does not correspond to the length scale of the equilibrium structure , which is determined by nonlinear processes .",
    "this naturally leads to an unanswered question : what happens when a solidification front advances in the present system ?",
    "the front motion will generate a particular length scale , the linear growth of any local density modulations will produce a slightly different length scale while nonlinear interactions will seek to generate a third length scale .",
    "we anticipate that the interplay of such processes will inevitably lead to disordered structures .",

    "<S> systems of soft - core particles interacting via a two - scale potential are studied . </S>",
    "<S> the potential is responsible for peaks in the structure factor of the liquid state at two different but comparable length scales , and a similar bimodal structure is evident in the dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical density functional theory in two dimensions is used to identify two novel states of this system , the crystal - liquid state , in which the majority of the particles are located on lattice sites but a minority remains free and so behaves like a liquid , and a 12-fold quasicrystalline state . </S>",
    "<S> both are present even for deeply quenched liquids and are found in a regime in which the liquid is unstable with respect to modulations on the smaller scale only . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the system initially evolves towards a small scale crystal state ; this state is not a minimum of the free energy , however , and so the system subsequently attempts to reorganize to generate the lower energy larger scale crystals . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamical process generates a disordered state with quasicrystalline domains , and takes place even when this large scale is linearly stable , i.e. , it is a nonlinear process . with controlled initial conditions a perfect quasicrystal can form . </S>",
    "<S> the results are corroborated using brownian dynamics simulations . </S>"
