    "the construction of inflationary models in string theory is an active research field , see @xcite for reviews .",
    "early proposals often involved few dynamical degrees of freedom , i.e.  a single field driving inflation , while all others are meticulously stabilized as in the kklmmt @xcite brane inflation @xcite setup .",
    "these models offer computational control and predictability , but they appear simplistic in the absence of any _ a priory _ reason or need for such frugality ; for instance , if inflation is driven by a brane / anti - brane pair , why should nt more pairs be included ? as a consequence ,",
    "multi - field models have become increasingly popular @xcite , especially since observable non - gaussianities , for which there is emerging experimental evidence @xcite , are possible @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if inflation is driven by more than one degree of freedom , the end of inflation can differ significantly : instead of a sudden end caused by the simultaneous decay of all fields , a stretched out decay phase is possible @xcite , and in some cases unavoidable @xcite , and the feasibility of ( p)reheating can change drastically @xcite .",
    "staggered inflation @xcite is not a new type of inflation , but a collective term coined for models that contain such decaying fields during inflation .",
    "if all fields decay in a few e - folds , as in @xcite , the preheating phase is merely extended , without strong observational consequences , but if they decay throughout the last sixty e - folds , additional signatures in the correlation functions of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are possible @xcite ( see also @xcite for additional signatures caused by particle production during inflation , as present in trapped inflation @xcite ) .",
    "we use the term `` decay '' loosely to indicate the partial or full transfer of an inflaton s energy ( potential and/or kinetic ) to an additional component of the energy momentum tensor , such as radiation .",
    "a concrete example is the annihilation of a brane / antibrane pair in the extension of the kklmmt proposal in @xcite ; whenever a brane comes in close contact to an anti - brane , they annihilate and produce closed string modes that redshift like radiation .",
    "other examples include inflation driven by tachyons @xcite , by multiple m5-branes @xcite or inflation on the landscape @xcite , among others .",
    "if many fields decay in any given hubble time , an analytic formalism , based on coarse graining , was developed in @xcite ; the aim of this study was to retain some of the effects caused by the decaying fields , such as contributions to the power - spectrum generated by the additional decrease of the energy that drives inflation , due to the fields decay as opposed to slow roll .",
    "as a consequence , contributions proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the decay rate and @xmath2 the hubble parameter , appear alongside the common slow roll parameters in observables such as the scalar spectral index or the tensor to scalar ratio ; furthermore , the new contributions may even be the dominant ones @xcite .",
    "however , any effect due to the sudden decay of an individual field is not retained . to ameliorate this shortcoming ,",
    "a single decay was discussed in detail in a concrete setup ( an extension of the kklmmt proposal ) in @xcite and in a related dbi - inflation setup @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that a jump in the equation of state parameter results after the decay .",
    "this discontinuity in turn causes mode mixing at the perturbed level . in @xcite",
    "the matching conditions for perturbations were derived in the sudden decay approximation , neglecting perturbations in radiation .",
    "a ringing pattern on top of the nearly scale invariant power - spectrum was found for sub - horizon modes @xcite ( see also @xcite for the same effect induced not by decays , but by a varying speed of sound ) and super - horizon modes showed small corrections . extending the model of @xcite further , to allow for many decays , should yield a power - spectrum that converges to the one of @xcite even for sub - horizon modes , as a superposition washes out any signals of the individual decays .    to this end ,",
    "we develop the numerical tools needed for such a comparison in this paper .",
    "we apply them to a much simpler setup motivated by inflation on the landscape @xcite , that served as a case study for the formalism in @xcite and enables us to compare results .",
    "we plan to use the code developed for this study in the more complicated , yet more realistic model of @xcite in the near future .",
    "besides developing and testing the numerical code , we show how the analytic treatment of staggered inflation in @xcite is recovered in the large @xmath3-limit , and argue that this formalism serves as an excellent approximation if more than @xmath4 fields decay in any given hubble time .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : bgrmodel ] we specify the model before reviewing the analytic results of @xcite in sec .  [ sec : largenlimit ] .",
    "the matching conditions derived in @xcite , which are needed for the numerical treatment , are provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : match ] .",
    "we then show in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] how the relatively simple results of @xcite are recovered numerically in the large @xmath3-limit , while we recover signatures of individual decays if only a few fields are present .",
    "details about the numerical code can be found in the appendix .",
    "if not stated otherwise we set the reduced planck mass equal to one , @xmath5 and use `` @xmath6 '' to denote equality to leading order in small parameters .",
    "consider @xmath3 uncoupled , scalar fields @xmath7 , @xmath8 with canonical kinetic terms and linear potentials @xmath9 such a potential is motivated by expanding a general potential on the string - landscape for fields that reside on flat stretches @xcite ; fields located on steep slopes evolve faster and become dynamically irrelevant for the evolution of the universe .",
    "hence , we are interested in a narrow distribution of the @xmath10 and fields with comparable potential energies . to keep the model as simple as possible , we consider @xmath11 and @xmath12 for all @xmath13 ( see @xcite for more general setups ) .",
    "such an expansion is expected to be valid for small ranges of field values only , so we use ( [ potential1 ] ) only up until some maximal field value @xmath14 ; if a field encounters @xmath15 , we assume that its potential energy is converted into an additional component of the energy momentum tensor , i.e.  radiation @xmath16 .",
    "thereafter , the field may be stabilized or continue to roll freely . in either case",
    "the field quickly becomes irrelevant for the evolution of the universe .",
    "we choose to set the potential to zero for @xmath17 and let fields roll freely for larger field values , always keeping @xmath7 and @xmath18 continuous through time .",
    "since we would like the previous stretches to be flat , we demand @xmath19 depending on initial conditions , some fields encounter @xmath15 earlier than others , causing `` decaying '' or `` dropping '' fields to enter the freely rolling phase in a staggered fashion . as we have no knowledge about the concrete initial conditions , we distribute the initial field values randomly over the interval @xmath20 , from which they evolve according to their klein - gordon equations @xmath21 with @xmath22 from ( [ potential1 ] ) for @xmath23 and @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "radiation is produced whenever a field encounters @xmath15 , taking over the remaining potential energy and redshifting as @xmath25 thereafter .",
    "if many fields drop out during any given hubble time , one can describe the system analytically @xcite by promoting the number of fields to a continuous function that decreases in time according to the decay rate @xmath26 this rate is not a new free function but set by the initial values and subsequent evolution of the fields .",
    "once @xmath27 , inflation ends because all remaining fields decay in a single hubble time .",
    "hence , inflation driven by many fields can take place as long as @xmath28 , that is as long as @xcite @xmath29 where we included a @xmath30 in the definition of @xmath31 to simplify expressions below .",
    "if inflation is of the slow roll type , that is if the slow roll parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 as well as @xmath34 and @xmath35 are small ( see @xcite for details on the hubble slow roll expansion for multi - field inflation ) , one can show @xcite that the combined energy of the fields and the one of radiation obey @xmath36 to first order in small parameters . here",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 in the limit of many decays during any given hubble time , radiation approaches a scaling solution where the energy loss due to redshifting is compensated by the infusion of energy from the inflaton sector , @xmath39 .",
    "further , the hubble slow evolution parameter becomes @xcite @xmath40    the analysis of adiabatic perturbations is straightforward , albeit tedious , and one can show that in certain cases ( for example in the model we investigate in this paper ) the effects of isocurvature perturbations are negligible @xcite .",
    "the scalar power - spectrum of the curvature perturbation on uniform density surfaces @xmath41 becomes @xcite @xmath42 where we reinstated the reduced planck mass and @xmath43 is a parameter of order one set by the background evolution @xcite ; since we are primarily interested in situations where the staggered inflation effects dominates over slow roll effects , @xmath44 , we do not need to compute @xmath43 and the scalar spectral index in @xcite simplifies to @xmath45 where @xmath46 similarly , the tensor power - spectrum can be computed to @xmath47 with the tensor spectral index @xmath48 and the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath49    for the linear potential in ( [ potential1 ] ) , we get @xmath50 so that @xmath51 and @xmath52 the number of e - folds @xmath53 becomes @xmath54 which allows us to express @xmath55 in terms of @xmath56 , @xmath57 the resulting scalar spectral index ( [ scalarspectralindex ] ) , tensor spectral index ( [ tensorspectralindex ] ) and tensor to scalar ratio ( [ tensortoscalarratio ] ) are @xmath58 these expressions are valid if the slow roll contributions are subdominant and many fields drop out in any given hubble time so that the coarse grained analytic treatment is justified .",
    "all signatures due to the sudden changes in the equation of state parameter whenever a field drops out are not retained .      in the next section",
    "we aim to test these analytic predictions numerically , without performing a coarse graining . to this end",
    ", we need to specify the model parameters . to avoid confusion ,",
    "we restore the reduced planck mass @xmath59 in this section .",
    "first , we want to compute observables around sixty e - folds before the end of inflation when modes that are observable in the cmb crossed the hubble horizon , @xmath60 we will vary the number of fields @xmath3 , but are particularly interested in the limit @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , we would like to impose @xmath62 ; to be concrete we set @xmath63 so that @xmath64 the inflationary scale follows from ( [ powerzeta ] ) with the cobe normalization @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 where we used @xmath67 .",
    "the critical field value follows from ( [ efoldslinear ] ) as @xmath68 one may check that @xmath69 , as desired .",

    "it is also useful to introduce gauge invariant field perturbations , for instance the sasaki - mukhanov variables , @xmath76 where the spatially flat gauge is defined by the condition @xmath77 .",
    "the equations of motion for the @xmath78 are @xcite @xmath79 in the absence of perturbations in additional degrees of freedom .",
    "even though we keep track of radiation at the background level , we ignore perturbations in @xmath16 .",
    "the sasaki - mukhanov variables have the advantage that their evolution is decoupled from the metric degrees of freedom .",
    "we assume that the @xmath80 are in the bunch davies vacuum at the onset of inflation , for @xmath81 , that is @xmath82 where the @xmath83 are independent unit gaussian random fields with < * e*_i > = 0 , = _",

    "since our ultimate goal is to numerically solve the equations of motion ( [ q - eq ] ) , we want to use analytic solutions up until the wavelength of a mode approaches the horizon size .",
    "however , whenever a field drops out , the analytic solutions do not conform to the vacuum solution any more , but carry an admixture of the second independent solution of ( [ q - eq ] ) , @xmath84 where we expand the hankel functions for large arguments and used @xmath85 during inflation . the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 need to be computed according to the matching conditions of the next section whenever a field drops .      when fields encounter the sharp drop in the potential , the equation of state parameter makes a jump due to the creation of radiation .",
