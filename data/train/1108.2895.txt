    "the recent discovery of superconductivity around 30 k in alkaline iron selenides @xmath7fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( @xmath8 k , rb , cs , tl ) @xcite has generated considerable excitement in the condensed matter physics community because the parent compounds of these materials are antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulators @xcite instead of being afm metals as the iron arsenide superconductors @xcite .",
    "because of their metallic nature , band structure calculations for iron arsenides have predicted the presence of the hole - like fermi surfaces at the @xmath9 point and electron - like fermi surfaces at the @xmath10 points in the brioullion zone using an orthorhombic full lattice unit cell @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", fermi surface nesting and quasiparticle excitations between the hole and electron pockets can give rise to static afm spin - density - wave order at the in - plane wave vector @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "indeed , neutron diffraction experiments have confirmed the @xmath12 afm order in the parent compounds of iron arsenide superconductors , and doping to induce superconductivity suppresses the static afm order @xcite .",
    "in addition , angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) measurements @xcite have identified the expected hole and electron pockets in superconducting iron arsenides , thus providing evidence for superconductivity arising from the sign reversed electron - hole inter - pocket excitations @xcite .",
    "if fermi surface nesting and electron - hole pocket excitations are essential ingredients for magnetism and superconductivity in fe - based superconductors @xcite , alkaline iron selenide superconductors should behave differently from iron arsenides since arpes measurements on these materials reveal only electron fermi surfaces at @xmath10 points and no hole fermi surface at @xmath9 point @xcite .",

    "in stark contrast to other fe - based superconductors , where optimal superconductivity generally occurs in the absence of a static afm order @xcite , the large moment afm order is believed to co - exist with superconductivity microscopically @xcite and the superconducting phase develops without much affecting the afm order @xcite . if magnetic moments up to 3.3 @xmath14 per fe indeed coexist with optimal superconductivity microscopically in @xmath7fe@xmath1se@xmath2 as suggested in powder neutron diffraction @xcite and muon rotation experiments @xcite , the electronic phase diagram in this class of materials will be much different than the other fe - based superconductors @xcite .",

    "however , such an fe - vacancy model with @xmath119 space group will not be able to explain the quasi two - dimensional rod scattering we observe in the triple - axis measurements .",
    "therefore , it remains unclear what crystalline lattice distortion gives rise to the observed superlattice reflections , although we know such scattering enlarges the nuclear unit cell by @xmath6 .",
    "we note that a recent x - ray study on superconducting rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 samples also found a @xmath6 superlattice structure @xcite .",
    "using single crystal neutron diffraction and neutron polarization analysis , we have confirmed that the block afm structure in fig . 1 is the only possible magnetic structure for insulating afm rb@xmath16fe@xmath17se@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "although we have also found a similar afm structure for the superconducting rb@xmath20fe@xmath21se@xmath2 , careful analysis of the diffraction spectra reveals another structural phase transition associated with enlarged unit cell for superconducting rb@xmath20fe@xmath21se@xmath2 . in previous arpes measurements on superconducting @xmath7fe@xmath1se@xmath2 @xcite",
    ", different groups have reached the same conclusion concerning the electron - like fermi surfaces at @xmath10 points .",
    "however , there have been debates concerning the origin of the observed weak electron pockets near the @xmath123 point @xcite . in principle",
    ", the electron pockets near the @xmath124 point can arise from band folding if there exists a @xmath98 structural or magnetic phase transition @xcite .",
    "our observation of the quasi two - dimensional @xmath114 superlattice reflections suggests that the observed electron fermi surfaces near the @xmath123 point may indeed be due to band folding instead of a surface state .",
    "since the block afm structure in insulating rb@xmath16fe@xmath17se@xmath2 can not arise from fermi surface nesting , we speculate that the @xmath6 lattice distortions in superconducting rb@xmath20fe@xmath21se@xmath2 may be associated with the metallic portion of the sample . in this picture , the superconducting phase in @xmath7fe@xmath1se@xmath2 may be mesoscopically phase separated from the nonsuperconducting phase , where superconductivity and afm order are intertwined in a very short length scale and live in separate regions . theoretically , it has been suggested that the @xmath125fe@xmath126se@xmath2 phase is a semiconductor with a low energy band gap @xcite .",
    "so with electron or hole doping , such a phase would become nonmagnetic and superconducting .",
    "although we have no direct proof that the superconducting portion of the sample is associated with the @xmath114 superlattice distortion , systematic neutron scattering measurements are currently underway to investigate the relationship of such phase to the block afm order and superconductivity .",
