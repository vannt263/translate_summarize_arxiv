    "the comparison of the luminosity profiles and rotation curves of disk galaxies provided the first evidence for dark matter in outer parts of galaxies ( e.g. , van albada & sancisi @xcite ) .",
    "the luminous material , either in the form of stars or neutral gas , is not able to reproduce the approximate flatness of the rotation curves at large radii , implying that the newtonian theory of gravitation needs to be modified or that the mass in the outer regions of most spirals is dominated by a dark component .",
    "the physical extent of such a `` dark halo '' can not be inferred from the rotation curves , since these last are flat even where the luminous material ceases to be detected .",
    "hence , the total mass in spiral galaxies is not yet well known .",
    "the properties of dark matter ( dm ) and the structure of dark halos as derived from rotation curves have profound implications on cosmological issues such as galaxy formation .",
    "recent n - body simulations of cold dark matter halos together with adiabatic infall models have shown that matching observed rotation curves requires a systematic increase of disk mass - to - light ratios with luminosity ( navarro et al .",
    "such a trend is observed in large bodies of rotation curve data ( broeils @xcite ; persic et al .",
    "@xcite  hereafter pss ) , and further comparisons between theoretical predictions and observations may help clarify the nature of dark matter in galaxies .",
    "the presence of a dark halo makes global mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios derived from rotation curves much higher than those expected from stellar populations , and produces radial gradients in the total m / l .",
    "the contribution of dm tends to be larger for low - luminosity systems , as the fraction of dm to luminous matter within the optical radius appears to decrease with increasing galaxy luminosity ( kormendy @xcite ; salucci et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in luminous systems , therefore , the mass distribution in the inner few disk scale lengths can be largely ascribed to the bulge and disk stars .",
    "consequently , when stellar galaxy components can be accurately isolated with surface photometry , estimates of their m / l from rotation curves provide useful constraints for the age , abundance , and star formation history of their stellar populations .",
    "recent population synthesis models predict trends of m / l with metallicity and with wavelength ( worthey 1994 ; bruzual & charlot 1993 ) , and can be used to infer and compare properties of the stellar populations in bulges and disks .",
    "we have reported in a previous paper ( moriondo et al .",
    "hereafter paper i ) the results of two - dimensional near - infrared ( nir ) surface brightness decompositions for a sample of early - type spirals .",
    "nir wavelengths , especially when combined with those in the optical , are a powerful diagnostic tool since they trace more accurately the stellar mass content and minimize the complications of extinction . in this paper",
    ", we apply the bulge@xmath4disk decomposition results to the analysis of the rotation curves for our sample . in sect .  2 we derive the radial mass distributions and evaluate the contribution of the bulge , disk , and dark halo to the observed rotation curves ;",
    "as an alternative to dark matter halos , we also derive a value of the modified newtonian dynamics critical acceleration parameter .",
    "the resulting nir m / l ratios of the luminous components are analyzed in sect .  3 , and compared with those at optical wavelengths and with population synthesis models .",
    "finally , we assess the importance of dark halos , and explore trends of m / l with luminosity in the context of the properties of the fundamental plane for gravitationally bound objects ( e.g. , burstein et al .",
    "the techniques used to reduce and analyze the photometric data are detailed in paper i. briefly , we decomposed the surface brightness distributions of each sample galaxy into the two components of bulge and disk .",
    "two independent methods were used : a ) a parametric fit assuming a generalized exponential bulge plus an exponential thin disk ; and b ) an iterative non - parametric ( np ) decomposition algorithm .",
    "we emphasize that both procedures decompose the entire two - dimensional brightness distribution , rather than the brightness profiles , and take into account the effects of seeing .",
    "the bulge is assumed to be an oblate rotation ellipsoid coaxial with the disk .",
    "in addition to the nir images , @xmath5 band brightness profiles and m / l ratios ( kent @xcite ) are available for ten galaxies of our sample .",
    "rotation curves ( rc s ) exist for all the galaxies in our sample ; the references for them are shown in table [ table : sample ] , together with general information regarding the sample . more information about the sample objects ( coordinates , etc .",
    ") can be found in paper i. hi data are available for six objects ; for the remainder , rc s were obtained from optical emission lines .",
    "we discarded absorption data since they are likely to yield a lower limit rather than a true estimate of the rotational velocity , due to the effect of velocity dispersion and projection along the line of sight .",
    "all distances were scaled to match our values , and circular speeds were corrected when estimated from inclinations differing from ours , with the exception of extended hi rc s derived from interferometric maps .      to determine the shape of the rc for our galaxies we assumed : a )  optical transparency ( which was also assumed for the surface brightness decompositions ) ; and b )  the m / l ratio of bulge and disk to be constant within each component .",
    "the circular velocity in the equatorial plane of an axisymmetric mass distribution is given by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the gravitational energy at radius @xmath5 .",
    "in this case @xmath8 is the sum of the contributions of bulge and disk and , when necessary , also of a dark halo .",
    "the circular speed of an axisimmetric ellipsoidal distribution of matter is given by ( binney & tremaine @xcite ) :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the bulge m / l ratio , @xmath11 the luminosity density at distance @xmath12 from the center in the equatorial plane , and @xmath13 the constant intrinsic eccentricity .",
    "to determine @xmath14 from the brightness distribution , when @xmath15 we can not invert the abel equation ( e.g. , binney & tremaine @xcite ) appropriate for spherical distributions .",
    "an alternative approach ( see appendix ) considers the `` strip brightness '' , @xmath16 , defined as the integral of the bulge brightness distribution along a path orthogonal to the line of nodes , at distance @xmath12 from the center . under the hypothesis of transparency ,",
    "this quantity is independent of the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "since    @xmath17    it is straightforward to determine @xmath14 ( and hence the rotation speed from eq . [ vcse ] ) once @xmath16 has been evaluated from the brightness distribution .",
    "equation [ derstr ] , in turn , can be expressed either in terms of a parametric or np profile respectively , depending on the kind of decomposition considered .      in the case of an infinitely thin exponential disk ,",

    "we have adopted the following expression for the circular speed ( toomre @xcite ; kent @xcite ) :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is again the disk surface density , and    @xmath26 ,                  \\ \\",

    "we have considered two different spherical distributions of matter to model the dark component .",
    "the first is a pseudo - isothermal sphere ( kent @xcite ) with density profile : @xmath30 and circular speed : @xmath31\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , the asymptotic circular speed , and @xmath33 , the scale length , are parameters of the distribution .",
    "the second is a sphere of constant density @xmath34 , with @xmath35 where @xmath34 is the only parameter of the distribution .",
    "this distribution , with @xmath36 linearly increasing with @xmath5 , is suited in some cases to represent the inner part of the halo rc ; it is in fact the limit of eq .",
    "[ vhalo ] for @xmath37 .",
    "we have adopted it whenever measurements of circular speed did not extend beyond the optical radius . in most cases",
    "the two models are mutually exclusive , since the latter can not fit a flat rc , whereas @xmath32 is not constrained if the data are restricted to the rising part of the rc .",
    "[ analysis : mond ]    to test the predictions of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond : milgrom @xcite ; sanders @xcite ; begeman et al .",
    " hereafter bbs ) , we have altered our model rc s according to the prescriptions given by bbs .",
    "in particular , the relation between newtonian ( @xmath38 ) and modified ( @xmath39 ) acceleration @xmath40 with @xmath41 can be used to derive the modified expression for the circular velocity .",
    "although in most cases the available rc s are not very extended , in six cases ( namely ngc  1024 , ngc  2841 , ngc  3593 , ngc  4698 , ngc  5879 , and ic  724 ) , the critical acceleration ( @xmath42cms@xmath3 ) is achieved within the radius sampled by the rc .",
    "these objects therefore can provide a test for mond .",
    "[ analysis : fits ]    with the exception of ngc  2841 and perhaps ngc  4698 , our rotation curves do not extend far enough to constrain effectively both the stellar m / l s and the halo parameters of eq . [ vhalo ] , and result in high uncertainties on the parameters ( of order 50% ) when all of them are fit simultaneously .",
    "moreover , a global fit of the three components , at least in the case of the isothermal halos , tends to attribute most of the mass to the halo at all radii .",
    "these difficulties were also noted by kent ( @xcite ) , who considered further assumptions and simplifications to better constrain the parameter space . in particular he suggested three possible kinds of fits .",
    "\\a ) maximum bulge@xmath4disk solutions ( mbd hereafter ) , in which the maximum amount of mass compatible with the rotation observed is ascribed to the visible matter .",
    "this can be achieved by fitting the rc with only the two stellar components for radii within two disk scale lengths , or up to the disk velocity peak for the np case . when the observed rc is constant or rising beyond this limit the dark halo contribution is added . in our case the mbd approach can be justified by noting that these are all relatively high - luminosity objects with @xmath43 , so that dm should not be important in the inner regions ( kormendy @xcite ; salucci et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; in general the rising part of the rc is well reproduced , confirming that this hypothesis is probably correct . moreover , in the case of ngc  2841 the simultaneous fit of the three components does not differ appreciably from the mbd one .",
    "for ngc  4698 it yields m / l ratios for disk and bulge lower by about a factor of two , although with higher uncertainties which make the result again consistent with the mbd results .",
    "\\b ) fits with fixed asympotic halo velocity , @xmath32 . if we assume that this parameter can be determined from the flat portion of the rc , the number of free parameters is reduced to three .",
    "only a few of our galaxies have extended rc s , so that an independent estimate of @xmath32 is possible only for ngc  2841 and ngc  4698 . in these two cases , however , the fitting routine is able to estimate @xmath32 with reasonable accuracy ( @xmath44 ) , so that we did not consider this kind of solutions .",
    "\\c ) fits with constant - density halos . adopting the halo distribution described by eq .",
    "[ vhalo_cd ] , again we have only three free parameters .",
    "we find that in general such a halo does not affect appreciably the contribution of bulge and disk to the rising part of the rc , thus yielding m / l s consistent with the mbd values .    on the basis of the above statements , and to define a homogeneous set of parameters , we decided to consider only the mbd solutions , assuming that the associated errors are realistic estimates of the true parameter uncertainties .",
    "the dark halo contribution was added for six galaxies out of 14 ; five of these have rc s measured at 21 cm , while for the sixth , ngc  2639 , the optical rc was sufficient to constrain the halo contribution . in the case of ngc  3593 , the radio measurements , extending to about 1.5 @xmath45 , could be fit reasonably well without any dark component . for each galaxy we chose the model halo ( the constant density or the pseudo - isothermal sphere ) which yielded the best - quality rc fit ;",
    "the constant - density halo was adopted for ngc  2639 , ngc  4450 , and ngc  5879 .",
    "comparing quantities which can be derived in both cases , such as the central density or the mass within the optical radius , we find no systematic difference between the two models .",
    "the resulting m / l s and halo parameters are given in table [ table : parameters ] , and table [ table : masses ] reports the masses of the various components .",
    "the values presented in the tables are the mean of the parametric and np results ; the error is the largest of the values for the semi - difference ( parametric and np ) and the formal error on the fitted parameter .",
    "figure [ figure : fits ] illustrates the fits to the observed rotation curves for both the parametric and np surface brightness decompositions .",
    "we note that the best results in most cases are obtained with the np fits , which in general match more closely the features of the observed curves .",
    "quantitatively , comparing the @xmath46 obtained in the two cases , we find a median ratio of the parametric to the np value of 1.3 .",
    "[ results : m_l ] disks have a mean m / l ratio of @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( solar units ) in @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with a dispersion of 0.6 and 0.4 , respectively ; the mean bulge",
    "m / l is @xmath51 in @xmath49 and @xmath52 in @xmath50 .",
    "we note that five galaxies ( namely ngc  2639 , ngc  3593 , ngc  3898 , ngc  4419 and ngc  5879 ) yield low values of bulge",

    ", this happens only in the np case .",
    "note that ngc  3593 and ngc  4419 are actively forming stars ( paper i ) , so a low m / l might be expected .",
    "kent ( @xcite ) also found low m / l ratios for these five galaxies , and interpreted this as an inconsistency between photometric and kinematical data , possibly due to non - circular motions of the ionized gas in the inner part of the galaxies .",
    "the same conclusion was attained by fillmore et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who have modeled both rotation and velocity dispersions from emission and absorption - line data for six galaxies , three of which are also in our sample ( see table [ table : sample ] ) .",
    "their models suggest that in most cases even the observed emission - line velocity underestimates the actual rc of the galaxy in the inner regions ( @xmath53  kpc ) . in the case of ngc  3898 and ngc  4450 , for instance ,",
    "a rough estimate of the bulge",
    "m / l from their model rc turns out to be respectively six and two times higher than ours . even these ` corrected ' values , however , remain lower by at least 15% than the disk m / l s estimated from the observed rotation .",
    "the dark halo parameters we obtain are similar to the ones derived for other samples , in particular for later type spirals using photometry in the optical passbands ( e.g. , kent @xcite ; kent @xcite ) .",
    "scale lengths @xmath33 are comparable to the optical size of the galaxies and range from 18 to 30 kpc ; the average halo mass is about @xmath54m@xmath1 within @xmath45 .",
    "the central halo densities show a rather narrow distribution , peaked at @xmath55 g @xmath56 , with a dispersion of about 20% .",
    "the average ratio of luminous to dark matter within the optical radius is around 2 , a typical value for bright spirals ( pss ) .",
    "for the six objects selected in sect .",
    "[ analysis : mond ] , we first performed a fit of the rc with @xmath57 and the bulge and disk m / l as free parameters .",
    "this yielded for @xmath57 a weighted mean of 1.3 in units of @xmath58 cms@xmath3 .",
    "we then performed two sets of fits keeping @xmath57 fixed to our value of 1.3 and to the value of 0.8 , corresponding to the @xmath59 obtained by bbs rescaled to @xmath60 kms@xmath61 .",
    "a visual inspection of the observed rc s and the models does not clearly favor one paradigm over the other .",
    "this qualitatitve statement is confirmed by the similar values of @xmath46 .",
    "two representative cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : n5879 ] : ngc  2841 , for which mond yields a particularly good fit , and ngc  5879 for which a dark halo seems to produce a significantly better result .",
    "the choice of @xmath57 turns out to be crucial only for ngc  2841 where only @xmath62 yields a good fit .",
    "bbs also found that this galaxy required a higher critical acceleration , probably because of an error in the estimated distance , and did not include it in their average . after removing ngc  2841 from the sample ,",
    "the remaining five galaxies yield @xmath63 , fully consistent with the bbs value .",
    "we have compared colors and m / l s for our sample with models of stellar population synthesis ( sps ) to place constraints on age and metallicity of the average stellar content of bulges and disks .",
    "in particular we have considered worthey s model ( @xcite , w94 hereafter ) for single stellar populations with ages from 1.5 to 17 gyr and different metallicities , and the 1995 release of the model by bruzual and charlot ( @xcite , bc95 ) for populations with solar metallicity and different star formation histories .",
    "the mean colors and m / l s of bulges and disks are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure : models ] together with the two sps models .",
    "the average m / l for the bulges are computed excluding values below 0.2 in all bands .",
    "w94 colors and m / l s agree rather well with the observed values , whereas bc95 have both bluer colors and lower m / l s .",
    "the discrepancies between the two models have been discussed by charlot et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "inspection of the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : models ] shows that bulges are notably redder than disks , both in @xmath64 and in @xmath65 ( see also paper i ) .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancies between different sps models , the degeneracy age / metallicity , and the possible effect of extinction make the color - color plot in fig .",
    "[ figure : models ] ambiguous as a diagnostic for distinguishing different stellar populations .",
    "fortunately , m / l ratios disentangle , at least partly , the ambiguity of age and metallicity .",
    "we find that bulges , on average , have lower m / l s than disks in all bands is not shown in the fig .",
    "[ figure : models ] , but @xmath49-band m / l s behave in the same way as those in @xmath5 and @xmath50 . ] .",
    "moreover , the values of m / l seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : models ] , according to the sps predictions , suggest that bulges are _ younger _ and _ more metal rich _ than disks . we note that both w94 and bc95 models of a given abundance follow approximately the same trend with age .",
    "hence , the displacement of the bulge and disk values relative to that trend implies that bulges are characterized by a younger age than that of the disks , independently of discrepancies between models .",
    "except for extreme inclinations , @xmath66 , dust in the central regions affects the bulge more than the disk ( bianchi et al .",
    "@xcite ) . consequently , the noted difference between bulge and disk",
    "m / l can not be attributed to internal extinction , since the correction would only increase the difference between the two .",
    "the possibility that the disk m / l s have been overestimated seems rather unlikely , even under the mbd hypothesis ( although see bottema @xcite ; courteau & rix @xcite ) since an average error greater than 30% on the estimated disk rc contribution would be required to make the disks average age comparable to bulges. finally , the bulge m / l s could have been systematically underestimated",
    ". this would be the case only if all the rc s ( and not just the few already noted and excluded from the mean ) rose too slowly in the inner regions with respect to the true circular velocity of the galaxy .",
    "we discussed briefly this point in sect .",
    "[ results : m_l ] , concluding that most likely such underestimates , if present , are not sufficient to eliminate the observed difference in m / l between the components .",
    "that bulges may be more metal rich than disks is not a new result ( bica & alloin @xcite ; delisle & hardy @xcite ; giovanardi & hunt @xcite ; paper i ) , and abundance variations are thought to be driven by variations with mass ( e.g. , zaritsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) . that bulges appear to be _ younger _ than disks is somewhat surprising ; the comparison with sps models shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : models ] implies an age difference of around 50% , or 5  gyr .",
    "nevertheless , such a result may be interpreted in light of recent observational and theoretical work on bulge dynamics .",
    "many bulges show kinematic and photometric signatures usually associated with disks , including flattened distributions , exponential fall - off , dominance of the rotation velocity component , and spiral structure in the bulge - dominated region ( kormendy @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , some bulges have blue colors , the result of extremely young populations ( schweizer @xcite ) , and as noted in paper i , at least three of the galaxies in our sample appear to be actively forming stars . as suggested by kormendy and others , `` bulges ''",
    "may be built up over time from disk material transported to the central regions by gravitational perturbations ; such bulges would appear younger than the disks from which they derive .",
    "[ ml ] since , as for the photometric properties discussed in paper  i , disk characteristics are more reliably determined than those of bulges , we will concentrate on the m / l s obtained for the disks .    several authors ( see for instance djorgovski & santiago @xcite , and references therein ) have demonstrated that elliptical galaxies follow a relation which can be expressed in terms of a power law : m / l  @xmath67 with @xmath68 depending on the sample and the photometric band .",
    "kent ( @xcite ) also found that the disks of spirals follow a similar relation in the @xmath5 band at fixed morphological type with an exponent @xmath69 .",

    "burstein et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have suggested that a relation of this kind between m / l and luminosity is common to all the self - gravitating structures in the universe , ranging from globular clusters to clusters of galaxies .",
    "finally , models of cold dark matter halos , based on n - body simulations and adiabatic infall for disk formation , require a variation of disk",
    "m / l with @xmath70 luminosity in order to accommodate observed rotation curves ( navarro et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we have investigated the compatibility of the values of @xmath72 found in the optical with our @xmath50-band data , assuming the trend of m / l with @xmath73 is due to disk stars and not to dm .",

    "@xcite ) . based on recent data , gavazzi ( @xcite ) finds : @xmath75 for early - type spirals .",
    "if we assume that @xmath76 is independent of luminosity ( which is likely since @xmath76 is typically small , @xmath77  0.2  mag ) , then we have a similar relation for @xmath78 with @xmath79 we take @xmath800.35 ( pss ) together with the slope of the color  luminosity relation defined above , we infer a value of @xmath81 .",

    "we have fitted a similar relation between disk scale lengths , central brightnesses , and peak rotation velocities of our disks , and find : @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this implies that the disks of early - type spirals also define a plane similar to that for ellipticals ; the elliptical fp has @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",

    "when we derive the m / l vs @xmath73 relation from eq .",
    "[ eqn : fp ] and the virial theorem we obtain : @xmath92 which contains a residual dependence on the central brightness @xmath93 .",
    "however our values for @xmath12 and @xmath94 yield @xmath95 where , as for ellipticals , the dominant dependence is on luminosity .    as discussed by djorgovski & santiago ( @xcite ) , a relation between m / l and luminosity ( or mass ) can come about in several ways .",
    "one possibility is that the disk m / l s are contaminated by a dm contribution which has a density profile similar to that of the stellar disk .",
    "the sense of the",
    "m / l vs @xmath73 relation would require this dm fraction to increase with luminosity , contrary to the trend observed for the global dm fraction which increases with _ decreasing _ luminosity ( e.g. , pss ) .",
    "alternatively , the mbd hypothesis could be incorrect , and the stellar disk m / l constant . in this case , though , the trend in fig .",
    "[ figure : ml_l ] would require the mbd hypothesis to be more valid in lower luminosity systems , contrary to common beliefs .",
    "another possibility is that disks of different luminosities harbor different stellar populations , which is also suggested by the color - luminosity relation mentioned above .",
    "w94 predicts that at fixed age , initial mass function ( imf ) , and star formation rate ( sfr ) , m / l is an increasing function of metallicity in the optical , but a _ decreasing _ one in the nir .",
    "this suggests that the m / l vs @xmath73 correlation can not be understood in terms of a metallicity variation .",
    "alternatively , such a correlation could be driven by a change of average age or star formation history with luminosity .",
    "again , the observed difference in the slope of the correlation at different wavelengths can be compared to the predictions of sps models . to test this possibility we made use of the bc95 models , at fixed ( solar ) metallicity and imf ( salpeter @xcite ) , considering single burst populations at different age @xmath96 , and populations with different e - folding time @xmath97 ( exponential sfr ) at fixed age ( 10 gyr ) .",
    "we have approximated the model dependence of m / l on @xmath96 and @xmath97 with power laws , whose index in @xmath70 and @xmath50 has been determined with a best fit . assuming m / l@xmath98 , in the first case the model predicts a difference in the slope of this relation of 0.17 passing to the @xmath50 band , consistent with the predicted difference of @xmath77  0.2 . considering the variation with @xmath97",
    "the prediction is @xmath77 0.2 , in similarly good agreement .",
    "it , therefore , seems plausible that the variation of m / l with luminosity is driven by different star formation histories , and the consequent different stellar mixes .",
    "[ dh ] we claim to recognize the presence of a dark halo in six of our galaxies : three of them are pseudo - isothermal and three constant - density spheres .",
    "we do not find any systematic difference between the two models , at least in terms of central densities or masses within @xmath45 .",
