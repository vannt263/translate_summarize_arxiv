    "there are hints that gc01 may be experiencing significant evolution at the present day , making it a potentially important laboratory for studies of cluster evolution , while also providing additional clues into its age .",
    "mirabel ( 2010 ) discusses an x - ray source that is located along the mir emission feature that slices through the cluster , and suggests that it is either the result of a pulsar wind nebula  possibly associated with a cluster member  or emission from a bow shock that forms as interstellar gas associated with gc01 is stripped from the cluster .",

    "2009 ) . given the likelihood that gc01 has lost mass due to tidal effects and internal evolution , and so was more massive in the past , the existing age estimates suggest that it could be one of the most massive clusters to have formed in the galaxy during the past few gyr .",
    "gc01 is thus of potential importance for studies of the evolution of the galactic disk .",

    "will be difficult  and it is noted later in this paper that measuring the brightness of the msto in gc01 without spectroscopic information may prove to be problematic due to differential reddening  it is still possible to gain additional information about their ages based on the properties of evolved cluster members , such as those that are undergoing core helium burning .",
    "the fractional contamination from non - cluster stars is lowest in the central regions of gc01 and gc02 , although the high stellar density introduces complications due to crowding .",
    "efforts to isolate stars in the crowded central regions of clusters require good angular resolution , and in the present paper we discuss observations that cover the @xmath24 m wavelength interval with angular resolutions between 0.1 and 0.25 arcsec fwhm of fields near the centers of both clusters .",

    "the paper closes with a summary and discussion of the results in section 5 .",
    "the data were recorded at the subaru telescope during parts of three nights in june and july 2015 .",
    "distortions in the wavefront were corrected using the raven moao science demonstrator ( andersen et al .",
    "2012 ; lardire et al .",
    "2014 ) , with the corrected signal directed to the imaging arm of the ircs ( tokunaga et al .",
    "1998 ) . the ircs @xmath26 alladin iii detector can be sampled with pixel scales of either 0.02 arcsec / pixel or 0.052 arcsec / pixel , and both modes were employed here .",
    "core observational elements of raven include ( 1 ) three natural guide star ( ngs ) wavefront sensors ( wfss ) that can be deployed over a 3.5 arcmin diameter field , and ( 2 ) two science pick - offs , each of which contains an @xmath27 element deformable mirror ( dm ) that corrects the wavefront at that location using information gleaned from the wfss .",
    "there is also a wfs designed for use with a laser beacon , but this was not used for these observations .",
    "the light from the science pick - offs can feed the imaging and spectroscopic modes of the ircs .",
    "each pick - off samples a 5.5 arcsec radius field , although vignetting and a slight overlap of the science fields when projected onto the ircs detector limits the useable field to @xmath28 arcsec .",
    "raven was built as a pathway science demonstrator with a limited budget .",
    "future moao systems will likely include more ngss and science pick - offs to increase the field of view and the order of correction , thereby better exploiting the multiplex advantage that can be realised with moao .",
    "raven has three operating modes : moao , ground - layer ao ( glao ) , and classical single conjugate ao ( scao ) .",
    "wavefront corrections for the moao and glao modes are applied with the system operating open loop ",
    "i.e. the control of the dms is based solely on the signal obtained from the wfss at that moment with no feedback from previous corrections .",
    "the scao system runs closed - loop , in which information from past corrections is used to control the dms .",
    "the observations discussed here were recorded in glao mode .    an observing log that lists filters , central wavelengths , total exposure times , pixel sampling , fwhm , and the dates of observation",
    "is shown in table 1 .",
    "the total exposure time entries in this table are the number of detector co - adds ( i.e. the number of detector reads @xmath29 the number of co - adds per read ) @xmath29 the integration time per co - add .",

    "[ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     sample completeness was estimated by running artificial star experiments .",
    "artificial stars were assigned colors that fall along the sequences in the cluster cmds , and an artificial star was only considered to be recovered if it was detected in at least two filters with a maximum matching radius of one half the fwhm .",
    "the dispersions in the recovered magnitudes and completeness fractions were computed after applying an iterative @xmath30 rejection filter to the mean difference between input and measured brightnesses in 0.5 magnitude intervals . with the exception of the @xmath31 observations of gc02 , the magnitude at which incompleteness sets in is defined by crowding in the nir data , rather than photon statistics .",
    "the photometric faint limits are thus much brighter than what would otherwise be expected from images recorded with an 8 meter telescope .      the @xmath32 and @xmath33 cmds of gc01 are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the stars plotted in these cmds were matched in filter pairs ( i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath6 or @xmath34 and @xmath6 , depending on the cmd ) , rather than requiring a match in all three filters .",
    "a maximum matching radius of one - half of the fwhm of the wider of the two psfs was adopted ",
    "sources in one filter that did not have a match within this radius are not included in the cmds .",
    "the 50% completeness levels determined from the artificial star experiments are indicated .",
    "the error bars in figure 2 show the @xmath35 uncertainties calculated from the artificial star experiments .",
    "the scatter near the faint end of the cmds more - or - less matches the error bars .",
    "however , the scatter near @xmath36 in the @xmath32 cmd of gc01 exceeds that expected from random photometric uncertainties , and we attribute this to differential reddening .",
    "a reddening vector , with an amplitude corresponding to @xmath37a@xmath38 magnitudes , is shown in each panel of figure 2 , and it can be seen that @xmath37a@xmath5 of a few tenths of a magnitude can explain the scatter in the @xmath32 cmd near @xmath39 .",
    "this scatter prevents us from measuring the slope of the giant branch , which might otherwise be used to estimate metallicity .    the fiducial giant branch sequence from the middle panel of figure 4 of ivanov et al .",

    "( 2009 ) reddening law ",
    "the typical a@xmath5 towards the center of gc01 is @xmath42 magnitudes higher than at larger radii .",
    "this higher reddening is perhaps not surprising given the broad range in a@xmath5 that is found throughout gc01 , coupled with the warm dust lane that cuts through the cluster center ( kobulnicky et al . 2005 ) .",

    "( 2005 ) identify a concentration of stars near @xmath36 in their cmd of objects within 20 arcsec of the cluster center that they suggest is the red clump ( rc ) .",
    "the rc in the left hand panel of their figure 4 forms a tilted sequence  likely due to differential reddening  and the locus of this sequence is shown in figure 2 .",
    "there is not an obvious corresponding sequence in the ircs@xmath41raven @xmath32 cmd .",
    "nevertheless , a concentration of stars due to the rc appears in the cmd after correcting for differential reddening ( see below ) .",
    "the nir sed of stars near the center of gc01 is examined in figure 3 , where the @xmath11 two - color diagram ( tcd ) is shown .",
    "the dotted line is the locus of points in figure 5 of ivanov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and there is good agreement with the raven measurements .",
    "fiducial sequences for red giants and iab supergiants from bessell & brett ( 1988 ) are also shown in figure 3 , as is a reddening vector that tracks the nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reddening law .",
    "differences between various reddening laws become significant for highly obscured objects like gc01 . extrapolating the gc01 observations along the nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2009 ) relation comes closer to intersecting the area of the tcd that contains the unreddened colors of giants than extrapolating along vectors defined by the rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) and the r@xmath43 cardelli et al .",

    "the nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reddening law is thus adopted for the remainder of the paper .    under ideal circumstances , reddenings for individual stars",
    "could be estimated by projecting each point on the tcd back to the unreddened giant sequence .",
    "however , there are large ( when compared with color differences between stars with different spectral - types ) random uncertainties in the photometric measurements .",
    "photometric variability contributes further to the smearing , although adelman ( 2001 ) finds that variability is likely not a factor among rc stars , at least over time scales of a few years .",
    "as scatter in the observations impedes efforts to identify an intrinsic color for individual stars , reddenings are estimated here by assuming that the stars in the gc01 cmds have a common intrinsic color .",
    "this assumption is reasonable as our cmds sample giants with m@xmath5 between 0 and -3 , and solar metallicity isochrones generated from the marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) models indicate that a narrow range of spectral - types ( k2iii to k5iii ) is expected in this m@xmath5 interval in old systems .",
    "if the stars in the cmds are assumed to have the intrinsic @xmath44 and @xmath45 colors of a k3 iii star then the mean reddening towards the center of gc01 is a@xmath46 based on the nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reddening law .",
    "the uncertainty is the standard error of the mean .",
    "the reddening depends on the adopted intrinsic colors , and if it is assumed that the intrinsic nir colors of each star match those of ",
    "say  an m1 iii giant , which falls near the middle of the giant sequence in figure 3 , then the mean extinction would be a@xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath3 dispersion in a@xmath5 computed from the tcd is @xmath48 magnitudes .",
    "given the scatter due to photometric errors and the assumption that all stars have the same intrinsic color then this is likely an upper limit to the smearing caused by differential reddening .",
    "sources with a@xmath5 between 1 and 1.5 are well - mixed throughout the raven@xmath41ircs field , suggesting that significant variations in line - of - sight reddening towards stars in gc01 occur over sub - arcsec angular scales .",
    "an arcsec corresponds to a spatial scale of @xmath49 parsecs at the distance of gc01 .",
    "given that the obscuring material is either at the distance of gc01 or is in the foreground then the ism towards the center of gc01 contains structure over spatial scales of no more than @xmath50 au .",
    "the cmds constructed from the unreddened photometric measurements are shown in the top panels of figure 4 .",
    "the vertical sequences in these cmds are the direct result of adopting a single intrinsic color when computing reddenings .",
    "the number of sources in the cmds in figures 2 and 4 are not the same , as only stars that were detected in all three nir filters have been de - reddened .",
    "hence , the cmds in figure 4 contain fewer stars than those in figure 2 .",
    "while the assumption of a common nir sed for all stars suppresses color - related information in the reddening - corrected photometry , the reddening - corrected cmds still contain useful information .",
    "there is a local peak in the number of stars near k@xmath51 in figure 4 , which we identify as the rc .",
    "these stars have @xmath52 if @xmath53 , which agrees with the rc magnitude found by ivanov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) at larger radii .",
    "there is also a drop in the number of stars in the @xmath54 magnitude interval fainter than the rc .",
    "the artificial star experiments indicate that the data are complete to k@xmath55 , and so the drop in number counts immediately below the rc in the cmd is not due to sample incompleteness .",
    "the change in number counts near k@xmath56 is examined in the lower panel of figure 4 , where cumulative number counts in 0.2 magnitude intervals are shown .",
    "the green dashed line is a least squares fit to the cumulative counts with @xmath57 .",
    "the rate of growth in",
    "number counts changes significantly near k@xmath56 . models of stellar evolution predict such a change to occur at magnitudes below the rc ( see below ) .",
    "van helshoecht & groenewegen ( 2007 ) examine the brightness of the rc in clusters that span a range of metallicities and ages .",
    "they conclude that m@xmath5(rc)@xmath58 in systems that have metallicities within a few tenths of a dex of solar and ages between 0.3 and 8 gyr . assuming that gc01 falls within this age range and has a near - solar metallicity ,",
    "then it has a distance modulus @xmath59 , corresponding to a distance of 5.2 kpc .",
    "the @xmath6 lf of gc01 , constructed from the de - reddened @xmath33 cmd , is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the range of magnitudes has been restricted to those where artificial star experiments predict that the data are complete .",
    "a 0.5 magnitude bin width was adopted as it is the smallest that would produce meaningful numbers of stars per bin in this magnitude range .",
    "the discussion that follows will not change significantly if a different starting point for binning is adopted .",
    "the models that are compared with the gc01 lf ( see below ) were constructed using the same binning parameters as the observations in an effort to further mitigate against binning errors .",
    "the shape of the lf in figure 5 provides clues to the age of gc01 , although features in lfs can be affected by stellar variability and uncertainties in the line - of - sight extinction , both of which cause smearing along the magnitude axis .",
    "davidge ( 2000 ) discusses the @xmath6 lf of the metal - rich globular cluster ngc 6528 , and those data provide an empirical point of comparison for gc01 .",
    "the lf of ngc 6528 shown in figure 3 of davidge ( 2000 ) climbs towards fainter magnitudes with the rc forming a pronounced peak .",
    "a smaller peak due to the rgb - bump ( iben 1968 ) is seen @xmath60 magnitude fainter than the rc .",
    "finally , there is a marked jump in the ngc 6528 lf @xmath61 magnitudes fainter than the rc that is due to the onset of the sub - giant branch ( sgb ) .",
    "there are similarities and differences between the gc01 and ngc 6528 lfs .",
    "the amplitude of the rc with respect to fainter stars in gc01 is comparable to that in ngc 6528 .",
    "however , when considered over a wide range of magnitudes the lf of gc01 is more - or - less flat , and the ratio of stars that are brighter than the rc to those that are fainter is higher in gc01 than in ngc 6528 .",

    "( 2008 ) isochrones are compared with the gc01 lf in figure 5 .",

    "the models have been scaled along the vertical axis to match the observations between k@xmath62 and 12 .",
    "this magnitude interval contains the majority of detected stars and is where the sample is statistically complete .",
    "the amplitude of the rc in the lf contains information about age .",
    "the models in figure 5 demonstrate that the amplitude of the drop to the faintward side of the rc is age - sensitive .",
    "similar behaviour can be seen in the compilation of open cluster cmds examined by van helshoecht & groenewegen ( 2007 ) that were used to establish their m@xmath5 calibration of the rc .",
    "the 9 clusters in their figure 8 that show few if any stars faintward of the rc ( ic4651 , ngc 2090 , ngc 2380 , ngc 2477 , ngc 2527 , ngc 3680 , ngc 3960 , ngc 5822 , and ngc 7789 ) have a mean age log(t@xmath63 ) @xmath64 , where the uncertainty is the formal error of the mean and the ages are taken from table 3 of van helshoecht & groenewegen ( 2007 ) . in contrast , the mean age of the clusters that have a well - defined sequence faintward of the rc ( be 39 , mell 66 , ngc 188 , ngc 1817 , ngc 2243 , ngc 2506 , ngc 2582 , ngc 6633 , ngc 6791 , ngc 6819 ) is log(t@xmath63 ) @xmath65 .",

    "the log(t@xmath63 ) = 9 model also predicts a steep rise in the number counts at magnitudes brighter than the rc and a large increase in number counts at k@xmath70 due to the onset of the main sequence .",
    "corresponding features are not seen in the observations .",

    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 cmds of gc02 are shown in figure 6 .",

    "this agreement also suggests that  unlike gc01  there is probably not substantial differential reddening near the center of gc02 .",
    "the @xmath33 cmd of gc02 is more richly populated than the @xmath32 cmd , owing to the lower line - of - sight extinction in @xmath34 when compared with @xmath31 . if a@xmath73 mag ( see below ) then the total extinction in @xmath31 as @xmath74 magnitudes higher than in @xmath34 , and this accounts for the difference in 50% completeness levels between the two cmds in figure 6 .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath33 cmd is comparable to that in the gc01 cmd in figure 2 , although the gc02 @xmath33 cmd goes 2 - 3 magnitudes deeper .",

    "( 2008 ) consider gc02 to be an old , metal - rich globular cluster .",
    "however , the the @xmath6 lf constructed from the raven@xmath41ircs observations does not show the onset of the sgb that is expected if the cluster is old .",
    "tighter constraints on the age of gc02 could be obtained using deeper , diffraction - limited nir images .",
    "for example , if gc02 is old but is more distant than assumed here then the sgb should show up with deeper images . if gc02 has an intermediate age and",
    "there is no large - scale differential reddening then it should be possible to detect the msto in the @xmath32 cmd of gc02 .",
    "given the distance and mean reddening of gc02 then the msto should occur near @xmath136 and @xmath137 if stars as young as 1 gyr are present .",
    "while the @xmath33 cmd of gc02 in figure 6 does reach the required depth in @xmath6 , the expected separation in color between the giant branch and 1 gyr main sequence stars on the @xmath33 cmd at this brightness is only @xmath121 magnitudes , which is comparable to the uncertainties in the photometry at this magnitude .",

    "2005 ; davies et al . 2011 ) and gc02 ( kurtev et al .",
    "2008 ) are based on star counts and/or isophotal measurements .",
    "these are restricted to the central few tens of arcsec in each cluster , as this is where the number density of cluster members exceeds that of field stars .",
    "the light profiles of gc01 and gc02 can be extracted out to much larger radii if the brightest resolved field stars are suppressed and the cluster light profiles are azimuthally smoothed to boost the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we demonstrate this using glimpse [ 3.6 ] images .",
    "the [ 3.6 ] image of each cluster was rotated about the cluster center in 15@xmath139 increments and the rotated images were then combined by taking the median flux at each rotated pixel location .",
    "this process multiplexes the faint signal from the cluster light profiles at large radii and suppresses signal from individual objects , the majority of which will be field stars at large radii .",
    "some artifacts of individual stars survive the median combination procedure , and these were suppressed by applying a @xmath140 arcsec ( i.e. @xmath141 the fwhm of the [ 3.6 ] psf ) running top - hat filter .",
    "this procedure tacitly assumes circular isophotes , and obliterates information over the angular scale of the smoothing filter , with the result that the light distribution near the cluster center can not be tracked .",
    "the [ 3.6 ] surface brightness profile of each cluster is shown in figure a1 , and light can be traced out to distances of at least 100 arcsec from the cluster centers .",
    "gc01 is much more centrally concentrated than gc02 , and the light profile of the former may be truncated at radii @xmath142 arcsec .",
    "signal from gc02 can be traced out to at least 200 arcsec ."
