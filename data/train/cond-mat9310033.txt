    "the thermodynamic behaviour of vacancies in solid @xmath0he is an interesting experimental and theoretical problem @xcite .",
    "vacancies in helium are more mobile than in any other solid . at the temperatures where solid helium exists",
    "the motion of vacancies requires a quantum mechanical description .",
    "they hop from site to site with a certain rate @xmath1 , leading to a band of states @xmath2 , much like the electron motion in the tight binding approximation . for @xmath0he",
    "the vacancies are obviously bosons , since the creation operator for a vacancy is the annihilation operator for a @xmath0he particle , which is a boson @xcite .",
    "the fact that two vacancies can not occupy the same lattice site has to be incorporated as a hard - core potential for the hopping bosons .",
    "so the simplest model for vacancies in @xmath0he is that of a gas of hard - core bosons on a lattice . in reality",
    "the strain fields around the vacancies produce a more complicated interaction between them than the simple on - site exclusion .",
    "however , we consider the hard - core boson approximation as a sufficiently realistic description of the vacancy motion to leave out these further refinements , in order not to complicate the model too much . the hard - core bosons on a lattice are known to be equivalent to a spin-@xmath3 quantum system with an interaction of the xy type @xcite .",
    "it is however not this analogy that is exploited in this paper .",
    "the reason is that the vacancy system is in practical circumstances always extremely dilute , which corresponds in the spin analogy to a system in an extremely large external magnetic field . in this limit",
    "the spin analogy is of little use and in our opinion less transparent than the particle language .",
    "experiments show that the percentage of vacancies in a crystal is at most of the order of 1% @xcite , at least at temperatures of the order of 1k , where the experiments take place . as a first approximation",
    "the vacancies thus behave as an ideal gas . however , present day experiments are sufficiently accurate that effects of bose statistics can be detected .",
    "it is one of our points that then also effects of the hard - core interaction become detectable .    in this paper",
    "we present a systematic analysis of the vacancies using @xmath4 as a small parameter , @xmath5 being the excitation energy , or band gap , required to create a vacancy .",
    "this is equivalent to a virial expansion @xcite for the quantum lattice gas , and we work out the properties in detail up to the second virial coefficient . a general formula for the second virial coefficient of the hard - core bose lattice gas is derived and evaluated for hypercubic lattices in one , two , and three dimensions .",
    "the case of the hcp lattice , which applies to real solid @xmath0he , will be treated elsewhere .",
    "the vacancies are represented by bose creation and annihilation operators @xmath6 obeying the usual bose commutation relations .",
    "the hamiltonian for the vacancies is given by @xmath7 here the transfer integral @xmath8 is equal to @xmath9 , and the hops take place between all pairs of nearest neighbours @xmath10 on the lattice .",
    "the coordination number of the lattice is @xmath11 , and @xmath5 is the energy required to create a vacancy .",
    "it functions as minus the chemical potential for the vacancies .",
    "the last term represents the vacancy - vacancy repulsion .",
    "it could be omitted in favour of a change to on - site fermi commutation relations for the @xmath12 , but we prefer to work with standard commutation relations and a potential @xmath13 which penalizes the simultaneous occurrence of two or more vacancies at the same site .",
    "we will let @xmath14 , or @xmath13 is much larger than any other energy in the problem .    without the potential term we have an ideal bose lattice gas",
    ", the hamiltonian of which can be diagonalized by the canonical transformation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of sites in the system .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions , and the wave vectors @xmath17 are restricted to the first brillouin zone of the lattice .    inserting ( [ trafo ] ) into the first two terms of ( [ ham ] ) we obtain the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath18 b^{\\dagger } ( \\vec{k } )",
    "b(\\vec{k } ) , \\label{h0}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the set of the @xmath11 nearest neighbour positions with respect to a centrally chosen site .",
    "@xmath5 is the gap of the energy band , since we have @xmath22 as lowest energy in the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "one sees that @xmath8 is a measure for the bandwidth , which for a @xmath23-dimensional hypercubic lattice is @xmath24 .",
    "the interaction is written in terms of @xmath25 as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a vector of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "the matrix elements of the interaction have no other structure than the conservation of the total incoming and outgoing momentum ( up to a reciprocal lattice vector ) , a feature which is of great advantage in solving the two - particle problem .",
    "the grand partition function of the vacancy system is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 given by ( [ ham ] ) , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 stands for the trace over all symmetrized states .",
    "as @xmath29 conserves the number of vacancies , @xmath32 can be expanded as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the canonical partition sum for @xmath35 vacancies excluding the contribution from the gap @xmath5 . of course ,",
    "@xmath36 , and @xmath37 because for one vacancy no hard - core effects enter .",
    "@xmath38 is the trace over @xmath35-vacancy states .    for @xmath39 we may deduce from ( [ expa ] ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the volume of the unit cell",
    ", @xmath42 is the pressure of the vacancies , and the @xmath43 are the fugacity expansion coefficients .",
    "the first of these , @xmath44 , reads @xmath45 where we have replaced the sum over @xmath17 by an integral over the brillouin zone .",
    "in contrast to the continuum ideal gas , @xmath44 is not simply related to a thermal wavelength @xmath46 as @xmath47 a formula of this type only results when the temperature is so low that @xmath2 may be replaced by its low - momentum behaviour @xmath48 defining an effective mass @xmath49 for the vacancies . for @xmath23-dimensional hypercubic lattices",
    "we find @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the lattice constant .",
    "using ( [ lowk ] ) in ( [ b1 ] ) and extending the @xmath17-integral beyond the brillouin zone to infinity ( as is allowed for large @xmath52 or small @xmath53 ) one finds ( [ b1l ] ) with @xmath54    the second term @xmath55 in ( [ vircs ] ) is our main concern in this paper .",
    "we find from ( [ expa ] ) and ( [ vircs ] ) @xmath56 we rewrite this expression by adding and subtracting the contribution of the non - interacting two - vacancy system .",
    "so we define @xmath57 \\label{b2int}\\ ] ] as the contribution of the hard - core interaction , and @xmath58 \\label{b20}\\ ] ] as the effect of the bose statistics of the vacancies .",
    "the combination @xmath59 yields the total effect .",
    "the statistical effects are trivial to calculate , as the unperturbed grand partition function is given by @xmath60 such that @xmath61 with @xmath62 given by ( [ b1 ] ) .",
    "thus it suffices to focus our attention on the calculation of @xmath63 . as a general observation",
    "we note that the two contributions in ( [ b2tot ] ) will have opposite signs . to see this more clearly",
    ", we go over to a series in the density @xmath35 of the vacancies , @xmath64 eliminating @xmath65 from ( [ vircs ] ) and ( [ dens ] ) we obtain a virial expansion for the pressure @xmath66 so at fixed density @xmath35 the statistical effects lower the pressure as @xmath67 is positive according to ( [ bl0 ] ) . the hard - core repulsion can only increase the pressure , so @xmath63 must be negative .",
    "the second virial coefficient ( [ b2int ] ) is evaluated as @xmath68 e^{-\\beta(e-2\\delta ) } , \\label{b2e}\\ ] ] where the level densities @xmath69 are given by @xmath70 the level densities are obtained from the formula @xmath71 which transfers the problem to the determination of the green s function , for which the general equation holds @xmath72 with @xmath73 a complex number . the density @xmath74 is obtained from @xmath75 as @xmath76    the states of the unperturbed 2-vacancy hamiltonian are denoted by two wavenumbers @xmath77 and @xmath78 with the property @xmath79 the matrix elements of @xmath80 are obtained from ( [ vk ] ) @xmath81 which shows that a representation in center of mass and relative coordinates will be advantageous . thus we introduce @xmath82 the sum over @xmath27 is eliminated by choosing the brillouin zone in such a way that no two points in it have values of @xmath83 differing by a reciprocal lattice vector , so that only the term with @xmath84 contributes .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath80 is then diagonal in @xmath83 . from now on we will assume that the brillouin zone has been chosen in such a way , and drop the reference to @xmath27 . since the total momentum @xmath83 is conserved by @xmath85 and @xmath80 , @xmath75 becomes diagonal in it .",
    "so , writing ( [ geq ] ) in the @xmath86 representation , we have @xmath87 the simplifying feature of ( [ gdiag ] ) is that the general matrix element of @xmath75 couples only to the total sum over the first entry of the matrix elements . for the latter we obtain an expression by summing ( [ gdiag ] ) over @xmath17 @xmath88 with @xmath89 given by @xmath90 now ( [ sumk ] )",
    "is an algebraic equation for the quantity in the left hand side . using the solution of this equation in ( [ gdiag ] )",
    "one finds @xmath91 note that the off - diagonal elements are of order @xmath92 while the diagonal elements are of order 1 . with ( [ gsol ] ) we can calculate the level density from @xmath93 leading to the compact expression @xmath94 , \\label{trdz}\\ ] ] which in turn yields for the difference @xmath95 @xmath96_{z = e+i\\epsilon}.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{rhodiff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this expression holds generally for any on - site repulsion @xmath13 .",
    "we may let @xmath97 , by which it will disappear from the formula as the @xmath13 term under the logarithm starts to dominate the argument for any @xmath73 and @xmath83 . omitting the 1 in the argument of the logarithm , the term @xmath98 drops out after differentiation with respect to @xmath73 .",
    "so for ( [ rhodiff ] ) we have in the limit @xmath97 the equivalent expression @xmath99_{z = e+i\\epsilon}. \\label{rhodiff2}\\ ] ] hereby the problem is essentially reduced to the evaluation of @xmath100 given by ( [ rdef ] ) .",
    "a few comments are in order about this expression . for bosons",
    "the state @xmath101 is the same as @xmath102 .",
    "so the relative momenta @xmath17 and @xmath103 should be identified with each other .",
    "both @xmath77 and @xmath78 run through a brillouin zone appropriate for the structure of the lattice , and this in principle defines the ranges of @xmath83 and @xmath17 . but as was mentioned before , we have chosen the brillouin zone such that there are no points whose values of @xmath83 differ by a reciprocal lattice vector .    from the definition ( [ rdef ] ) of @xmath104 and the expression ( [ states ] ) for @xmath105 one sees that @xmath106 occurs as a shift in the energy variable and the @xmath107 are functions of @xmath108 .",
    "taking @xmath108 as an integration variable in ( [ b2e ] ) one finds @xmath109 e^{-\\beta e ' } , \\label{b2e2}\\ ] ] with @xmath110_{z = e'+i\\epsilon } , \\label{rhoe2}\\ ] ] and @xmath111 given by @xmath112 in this formula @xmath5 is eliminated , as it should be . using the fact that @xmath113 , we can further rewrite ( [ rhoe2 ] ) @xmath114 with @xmath115    from ( [ rhoe2 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) one sees that only @xmath116 values occur in ( [ b2e2 ] ) which lead to complex values of @xmath111 .",
    "these occur when @xmath117 is a pole in the @xmath17-integration in ( [ r2 ] ) .",
    "thus the combined bandwidth of @xmath118 determines the range of @xmath116 values .",
    "this is twice the bandwidth of @xmath2 just as in the ideal bose contribution ( [ bl0 ] ) .",
    "we interrupt the general discussion for the treatment of the one - dimensional case of ( [ b2e2])-([fdef ] ) , as this case is interesting , completely analyzable , and elucidating for the structure of the functions occurring in ( [ b2e2])-([fdef ] ) .",
    "the @xmath119 band structure is given by ( for a lattice constant @xmath120 ) @xmath121 which gives for @xmath62 the expression @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "for the evaluation of @xmath124 we rearrange the brillouin zone in such a way that its boundaries in @xmath125 space are convenient , and also such that no reciprocal lattice vector @xmath126 enters into the problem . in figure [ bzfig ]",
    "we have divided the original brillouin zone @xmath127 into four domains , i , ii , iii , and iv .",
    "domains i and iv , as well as ii and iii , refer to the same states , as they are obtained from each other through interchanging @xmath128 .",
    "so it suffices to take one of each , say i and iii .",
    "now iii is equivalent to iii@xmath129 , which follows from iii by shifting @xmath130 over @xmath131 . the combined domain",
    "i and iii@xmath129 is given in @xmath132 space by @xmath133 .",
    "using this parameter space one can write ( [ r2 ] ) explicitly as ( dropping the primes ) @xmath134 for convenience we put @xmath135 , and have @xmath136 according to equations ( [ rhof ] ) and ( [ fdef ] ) we are interested in real values of @xmath137 .",
    "so , letting @xmath138 , the integral has a real part given by a principal value integral , and an imaginary part given by an integral over a delta function @xmath139 two cases must be distinguished : for @xmath140 , the imaginary part of @xmath141 is zero , and for @xmath142 the important quantity in equations ( [ rhof ] ) and ( [ fdef ] ) is @xmath143 . from ( [ rintsecond ] )",

    "@xmath141 is pure imaginary with a negative imaginary part .",
    "so we find that @xmath147 these values of @xmath148 are plotted in figure [ fifig ] in the @xmath149 plane .",
    "integrating in the @xmath150-direction , we find for @xmath151 @xmath152 using @xmath137 instead of @xmath153 in ( [ b2e2 ] ) as integration variable we have @xmath154 e^{-4\\beta t(\\zeta + 1 ) } . \\label{rhozeta}\\ ] ] due to the differentiation with respect to @xmath73 in ( [ rhof ] ) only values of @xmath137 between @xmath155 and 1 contribute to the integral . from ( [ 1df ] )",

    "this is exactly what has to be expected from the well known fact that a hard - core bose gas in one dimension is equivalent to an ideal fermi gas ( for all virial coefficients ) .",
    "the picture shown in figure [ fifig ] for the phase @xmath148 has some general validity , in the sense that for sufficiently negative @xmath137 one has @xmath161 while for @xmath137 sufficiently positive @xmath162 . in the zone in between one",

    "the second virial coefficient @xmath197 thus approaches @xmath198 for high temperatures .",
    "this is indicative of fermionic behaviour , which is indeed what one would expect : at high temperatures , the only important contribution to the free energy of the system is the entropy involved in distributing a certain number of hard core particles over the lattice .",
    "this is the same as for fermions .",
    "for @xmath199 the behaviour of ( [ ratio ] ) depends on the behaviour of @xmath151 for @xmath200 . in two dimensions , @xmath201 , which leads to @xmath193 going to zero like @xmath202 as @xmath199 .",
    "the same low - temperature behaviour is found for quantum hard disks @xcite . in three dimensions , @xmath203 , which gives @xmath204 for @xmath205 , just as for quantum hard spheres @xcite .",
    "so in both cases , @xmath55 approaches the value for the ideal bose gas at low temperatures .",
    "this shows that when the thermal wavelength ( [ lambda ] ) exceeds the lattice constant @xmath206 , the effects of the bose statistics starts to dominate .",

    "it turns out that the effect of the hard - core interaction on @xmath55 depends strongly on temperature and on the transfer integral @xmath8 . for small @xmath191",
    "it is fermionic in character , as far as @xmath55 is concerned . for large @xmath191 the effect of the hard - core disappears , and only the bose character remains .",
    "the system of vacancies that exists in solid @xmath0he should behave to a good approximation like this simple model : the vacancies move through the crystal lattice by a tunneling process , they are bosons , and they have a hard - core repulsion . the gas of vacancies has been experimentally studied by probing the attenuation and the velocity shift of sound in a @xmath0he crystal @xcite .",
    "very pure hcp helium was used , so that the effects of both the phonons and the delocalized , bosonic vacancies could be observed . treating the vacancies as a gas of free particles",
    ", it was seen that they obey bose statistics . for the expressions ( [ pee ] ) and",
    "( [ en ] ) this means that not only the first term , but at least also the second is experimentally observable .",

    "it is difficult to extract this information from the attenuation experiment , since there it is not clear what exactly the relation between the measured quantities and the vacancy density is",
    ". it would be necessary to directly measure , say , the pressure due to the vacancies @xcite , and then compare this with ( [ pee ] ) .",
    "in such an experiment it would be crucial to take the hard - core effects into account .",
