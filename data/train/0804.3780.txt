    "studies of hyperon energies in nuclear matter are a useful starting point for calculations of bulk properties of hypernuclei .",
    "furthermore , inclusion of strangeness in the equation of state is important towards a better understanding of the properties of matter inside neutron stars .",
    "this work is another step in our systematic exploring of nuclear and neutron matter under diverse conditions",
    ".    previously @xcite we reported predictions of the @xmath0 binding energy in nuclear matter using the most recent meson - exchange nucleon - hyperon ( ny ) potential from the jlich group @xcite ( hereafter referred to as  ny05 \" ) and including relativistic ",
    "dirac \" effects on the @xmath1 potential . in this paper",
    ", we will explore the behaviour of the self - consistently calculated single-@xmath0 and single - nucleon potentials with changing @xmath0 fraction .    in our previous paper on the subject @xcite",
    ", we discussed how some major quantitative differences between ny05 and the earlier version of the jlich ny meson - exchange potential @xcite impact predictions in dense matter .",
    "accordingly , we expect large quantitative differences ( beyond relativistic effects ) when comparing with earlier microscopic calculations conducted within the brueckner - hartree - fock framework ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which used the nijmegen @xcite and/or the jlich @xcite ny meson - exchange potentials .",
    "for matter with non - vanishing hyperonic densities , the nucleon , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 single - particle potentials are the solution of a coupled self - consistency problem : @xmath3 in the above equations , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , ( @xmath7 ) , are the nucleon - nucleon , nucleon - hyperon , and hyperon - hyperon @xmath8-matrices at some nucleon and hyperon densities defined by the fermi momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    in the present calculation",
    "we consider a non - vanishing density of @xmath0 s but ignore the presence of real @xmath2 s in the medium ( although both @xmath0 and @xmath2 are included in the coupled - channel calculation of the ny @xmath8-matrix , with free - space energies used for the latter ) .",
    "this scenario can be justified noticing that the ( strong ) reaction @xmath11 is energetically always allowed , although it could be prevented by the pauli principle at large hyperon concentrations .",
    "thus , over a time scale which is long relative to strong processes , and for small hyperon concentrations , equilibrated matter can be reasonably assumed to contain mostly nucleons and @xmath0 s @xcite . also , we neglect the @xmath12 interaction , as very little information is available about it . for these reasons ,",
    "we keep the @xmath0 concentration relatively low .",
    "we start with symmetric nuclear matter at some fermi momentum @xmath9 in the presence of a  @xmath0 impurity \" , i.e. @xmath13 and then increase the @xmath0 concentration .",
    "the parameters of both the nucleon and the @xmath0 potentials are calculated self - consistently with the @xmath5 and the @xmath4 interactions , which are the solution of the bethe - goldstone equation with @xmath14 and @xmath15 potentials , respectively .",
    "we solve the coupled self - consistency problem above using the same techniques as described previously for isospin - asymmetric matter @xcite . in the brueckner calculation ,",
    "density - dependent effects come in through angle - averaged pauli blocking and dispersion .",
    "most of the details for the nucleon - nucleon sector are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for two particles with masses",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 , ( @xmath18 ) , and fermi momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 , pauli blocking requires @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angle between the total ( @xmath21 ) and the relative ( @xmath22 ) momenta of the two particles , and @xmath23 .",
    "angle - averaging is then applied in the usual way .",
    "dirac effects are applied in the @xmath15 as well as the @xmath1 potentials .",
    "this entails involving the @xmath0 single - particle dirac wave function in the self - consistent calculation through the @xmath0 effective mass @xcite . for the nucleon - nucleon sector , we use the bonn b potential @xcite , which is a relativistic one - boson exchange potential developed within the context of the thompson equation and uses the pseudovector coupling for pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the problem associated with the dbhf approach and the use of the pseudoscalar coupling for the interactions of pions and kaons with nucleons and hyperons , ( which occurs for the jlich ny potential ) , was discussed in ref .",
    "we show in fig .  1 the single - nucleon and the single-@xmath0 potentials as a function of the momentum",
    ". the first panel corresponds to a nucleon fermi momentum of 1.35@xmath24 and zero density of @xmath0 particles , that is , the situation of a @xmath0 impurity in nuclear matter .",
    "notice that this implies @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the average fermi momentum and @xmath28 .",
    "the other three cases correspond to @xmath29=0.8 , 0.7 , and 0.6 , keeping the average fermi momentum constant . in terms of @xmath0 fraction , @xmath30",
    ", the above @xmath29 values correspond to @xmath30=@xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively . in all panels ,",
    "the two lower curves ( solid and dash ) are the results of a conventional brueckner calculation ( solid ) and of a dbhf calculation ( dash ) for the nucleon potential , whereas the higher curves have the same meaning for the @xmath0 single - particle potentials , with the dotted lines being the dirac predictions . in the first panel of fig.1 ,",
    "the value of @xmath35 at @xmath36=0 is of course the @xmath0 binding energy we calculated in ref .",
    "the dirac effect is small at low momentum but increases considerably with increasing momentum , and even more so for the nucleon .",
    "with increasing @xmath0 concentration , the total density remaining constant , both potentials become less attractive , the effect being more pronounced for the @xmath0 .",
    "consistent with fig .  1 , the @xmath0 effective",
    "mass becomes larger with increasing @xmath30 ( although very slowly ) , while the nucleon effective mass is considerably less sensitive to these ( small ) variations , see fig .",
    "the results shown in fig .  1 can be understood observing that , as the @xmath0 fraction increases , @xmath35 will receive contribution from a smaller number of nucleons ( the @xmath37 interaction is neglected , see second line of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) , whereas @xmath38 will have a slightly reduced contribution from @xmath4 and a slightly enhanced contribution from @xmath39 , see first line of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . also , the dirac effect becomes smaller with increasing @xmath0 concentration , which is also plausible since this effect is larger for nucleons .",
    "comparing with the microscopic predictions from ref .",
    "@xcite , we see that the qualitative features are similar , but there are very large quantitative differences due to the use of different @xmath14 potentials , the depth of @xmath35 at zero @xmath0 density being about -30 mev in ref .  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "3 we compare the single - nucleon and the single-@xmath0 potentials ( dbhf predictions only ) at two different densities , corresponding to a nucleon fermi momentum equal to 1.25@xmath24 and 1.4@xmath24 , respectively , with the @xmath0 fraction kept fixed at @xmath40 .",
    "both potentials start deeper at the larger density . as already clear from fig .  1",
    ", @xmath38 grows repulsive ( as a function of the momentum ) at a much faster rate than @xmath35 .",
    "figure 3 shows that this is more so the larger the density , most likely due to the ( very density - dependent ) dirac effect , which impacts nucleons more strongly .",
    "we have reported non - relativistic and dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock predictions of the @xmath0 and nucleon single - particle potentials in nuclear matter at moderately high densities .",
    "we examined the significance of dirac effects as a function of momentum and @xmath0 concentration .",
    "dirac effects on hyperons may be important at the higher densities , where high momenta are probed .",
    "we have neglected the @xmath37 interaction , which is not a serious problem at low @xmath0 concentrations .",
    "the hyperon fraction in @xmath41-equilibrated matter is of course density dependent , but we expect that it will remain relatively small , especially if the @xmath14 interaction is fully taken into account ( as compared to a model of non - interacting hyperons ) .",
    "this is because the ( repulsive ) short - range @xmath14 interaction will become effective at high density and , to a certain degree , may prevent the growth of the hyperon fraction ( at the expenses of the lepton population ) which has been observed in models of non - interacting hyperons @xcite .",
    "hypernuclei can be produced in large number using relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "calculations such as the present one can be useful as a foundation for studies of hypernuclei based on generalized mass formulas @xcite and thus predictions of stability of systems where one or more nucleons are replaced with @xmath0 s . since the energy of a single @xmath0 impurity in symmetric matter ( at normal nuclear matter density ) is about -50 mev ( or about -30 mev , depending on the @xmath14 potential being used ) , whereas the average energy of a nucleon in nuclear matter is approximately -16 mev , one may conclude that it is energetically favorable to replace a single nucleon with a single @xmath0 .",
    "of course this may no longer be true with increasing @xmath0 fraction , as the @xmath0 particles will have to acquire kinetic energy to obey the pauli principle .",
    "this and other issues will be explored further in forthcoming work .",
