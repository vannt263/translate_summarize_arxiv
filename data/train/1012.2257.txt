    "nonlinear differential equations play a relevant role in the study of evolution in terms of an evolution parameter , what has motivated physicists interest during the last forty years .",
    "the lack of a general procedure for determining their general solutions justifies the analysis of particular instances where solutions can be investigated via algebraic or geometric methods .",
    "an important example are lie systems , which admit a superposition rule giving the general solution in terms of a finite set of particular solutions .",
    "these systems describe the integral curves of @xmath0-dependent vector fields which are @xmath0-dependent linear combinations of vector fields closing on a finite - dimensional real lie algebra ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for a modern presentation of the theory of lie systems @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting instance of lie system is the riccati equation , a generalisation of the inhomogeneous linear equation .",
    "one of its main characteristics is the existence of an action of the group of curves in @xmath1 on the set of riccati equations , what can be used for reduction of a given riccati equation into a simpler one .",
    "this is for instance the case when a particular solution of a given equation is known @xcite .",
    "moreover , this property can be shown to be common to all lie systems @xcite .",
    "a generalisation of lie systems has recently been proposed allowing us to use some of the techniques applicable to lie systems to this more general class of systems .",
    "this paper deals with a specific example , the abel equation , with applications in many different branches of physics .",
    "there are several differential equations called abel equation .",
    "the first - order abel equation of the first kind @xmath2 is a generalisation of the riccati equation ( the particular case @xmath3 ) introduced by abel within the theory of elliptic functions , while the first - order abel equation of the second kind is of the form : @xmath4 which reduces into one of the first kind by means of the transformation @xmath5 with coefficients @xmath6 therefore , we can restrict ourselves to study the abel equations of the first kind .",
    "we can also consider the generalised first - order abel equation @xcite @xmath7 or the second - order abel equation @xcite : @xmath8 the @xmath9-order abel equation is a linear combination of the different members of a hierarchy of @xmath10-order abel equations with functions @xmath11 as coefficients @xcite : @xmath12 here , @xmath13 denotes the differential operator @xmath14 , and the action of @xmath13 leads to a family of differential equations whose first members are given by a sequence @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "abel equations appear in the reduction of order of many second- and higher - order equations , and hence are frequently found in the modeling of real problems in many areas , for instance , emden equation , @xmath17 , emden ",
    "fowler equation , @xmath18 , the van der pol equation @xmath19 , the duffing equation , @xmath20 , and many other equations .",
    "they also play a relevant role in the study of quadratic systems in the plane @xcite and the center - focus problem @xcite .",
    "the linard equation @xmath21 was studied in @xcite .",
    "defining @xmath22 , it may be written @xmath23 , which is an abel equation of the second kind , related by @xmath24 ( see ( [ firsttosecond ] ) ) to the abel equation of the first kind : @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , the one studied by bougoffa @xcite , @xmath26 reduces to @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , the autonomous dissipative milne ",
    "pinney equation can be transformed into a second kind abel equation : @xmath28 which is related to the first kind abel equation @xmath29 .",
    "the abel equation was used by majorana in the study of thomas  fermi equation : @xmath30 which is a particular case of emden  fowler equation , and it is also used in the study of cosmological models @xcite .",
    "the general solution of the cosmological einstein - friedmann equations for the universe filled with a scalar field for a given potential can be expressed via the general solution of the abel equation of the first kind @xcite .",
    "another more recent application can be found in @xcite .",
    "there are ( systems of @xmath9 ) first - order differential equations ( to be called lie systems ) that admit a superposition rule , i.e. a function @xmath31 such that the general solution can be written as @xmath32 , the simplest example being the inhomogeneous linear equation @xmath33 for which there is a superposition rule involving two generic particular solutions : @xmath34 moreover , it admits a solution in terms of two quadratures : @xmath35\\ ] ] another well known example is the riccati equation , i.e. the following nonlinear differential equation : @xmath36 this type of equations does not admit integration by quadratures in the general case .",
    "their solutions are the integral curves of the @xmath0-dependent vector field @xmath37 which is a linear combination with @xmath0-dependent coefficients of the vector fields @xmath38 that close on a three - dimensional real lie algebra , with defining relations @xmath39 = x_{0 } \\ , ,       \\quad   [ x_{0},x_{2 } ] = 2x_{1}\\ , ,",
    "\\quad [ x_{1},x_{2 } ] = x_{2 } \\,,\\ ] ] isomorphic to the @xmath40 lie algebra .",
    "therefore it is a lie system admitting a superposition rule which turns out to be @xcite @xmath41 the vector fields @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are a basis of the fundamental vector fields relative to the action of the group @xmath1 on @xmath45 : @xmath46 a riccati equation can be seen as a curve in @xmath47 and each element @xmath48 of the group @xmath49 of smooth @xmath50-valued curves , @xmath51 , transforms every curve @xmath52 in @xmath53 into a new one @xmath54 satisfying a new riccati equation with coefficients @xmath55 : @xmath56 these expressions define an affine action of the group @xmath49 on the set of riccati equations .",
    "an appropriate choice for the curve , @xmath48 , transforms the original riccati equation into a simpler one , for instance an integrable by quadratures one .",
    "the conditions for the existence of such a transformation provide us with integrability conditions @xcite .",
    "moreover , similar properties hold for any other lie system .",
    "each @xmath0-dependent vector field whose integral curves are the solutions of an abel equation is a linear combination with @xmath0-dependent coefficients of the vector fields in the linear space @xmath57 defined by @xmath58 such a @xmath0-dependent vector field is not , in general , a lie system . indeed , consider a @xmath0-dependent vector field @xmath59 , with a non - constant function @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath61 determines a lie system , there must exist a finite - dimensional lie algebra @xmath62 including the vector fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 such that @xmath65 .",
    "nevertheless , this is impossible as such a lie algebra should contain the successive lie brackets of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which span an infinite family of linearly independent vector fields ( note that @xmath66=(n-2)x^{n+1}\\partial_x$ ] ) .",
    "as pointed out in a recent paper @xcite , we can however look for a linear subspace @xmath67 such that @xmath68 is a lie algebra satisfying that @xmath69\\subset v_{{\\rm abel}}(\\mathbb{r})$ ] .",
    "in such a case the flows of time - dependent vector fields with values in @xmath68 leave invariant the linear space @xmath70 and starting with a given abel equation we obtain a new abel equation from each flow .",
    "maybe , by an appropriate flow , the transformed abel equation becomes a lie system . in this case the initial abel equations is called a quasi - lie system .    our aim is , given @xmath71 , to determine @xmath72 such that @xmath73\\subset v_{abel}(\\mathbb{r})$ ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath74=-f'(x)\\partial_x\\in v_{{\\rm abel}}(\\mathbb{r}).\\ ] ] hence , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "using now the condition @xmath77=(f(x)-xf'(x))\\partial_x\\in",
    "v_{{\\rm abel}}(\\mathbb{r}),$ ] we obtain that @xmath78 , and @xmath79=(2xf(x)-x^2f'(x))\\partial_{x}\\in v_{{\\rm abel}}(\\mathbb{r})$ ] yields that @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath81 must satisfy that @xmath82=(3x^2f(x)-x^3f'(x))\\partial_{x}\\in v_{{\\rm abel}}(\\mathbb{r}),$ ] we also see that @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , every symmetry group of @xmath70 admits a lie algebra of fundamental vector fields @xmath84 contained in the lie algebra @xmath85 we find in this way the so - called structure invariance group @xcite , which turns out to be the affine group in one dimension .    correspondingly , the set of first - order abel equations of the first kind is invariant under all the following transformations @xcite @xmath86 under such a transformation the given abel equation ( [ firstkind ] ) becomes a new abel equation @xmath87 , with @xmath88 this is a very useful property : the action of the group of curves in the affine group produces orbits , i.e. equivalence classes of abel equations , with the same properties of integrability or existence of superposition rules . for instance",
    ", abel equations of an orbit containing an integrable by quadratures riccati equation are also integrable by quadratures .",
    "the orbits are characterized by different values of invariant functions .",
    "one must determine the lie algebras contained in @xmath89 reachable by the set of transformations ( the coefficient of @xmath90 can not be transformed to be zero , see first equation in ( [ abeleqtrans ] ) ) .",
    "it is possible to check that the only subalgebra of dimension three is the one of riccati equation which is not reachable by the considered set of transformations . on the other hand",
    ", there is a one - parameter family of two - dimensional subalgebras of @xmath89 reachable from a proper abel equation , those generated by @xmath91 these are integrable by two quadratures .",
    "for instance the case @xmath92 corresponds to bernoulli equation .",
    "finally , the algebras generated by vector fields @xmath93 lead to separable differential equations , therefore integrable by one quadrature .",
    "starting from an abel equation of the first kind with @xmath94 , we can define a transformation @xmath95 which reduces the original equation to a new one @xmath96 where @xmath97 in fact , a translation @xmath98 transforms the given equation into : @xmath99 and then @xmath100 choosing @xmath101 we find that @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 and @xmath105 are given by the above given expressions .",
    "when @xmath106 , we obtain a first possibility for the canonical form @xmath107 which is a bernoulli equation for @xmath108 , and therefore solvable by the change of variable @xmath109 , which leads to the inhomogeneous linear equation @xmath110    on the contrary , if @xmath111 , under the transformation @xmath112 the equation becomes @xmath113 , and we obtain as a canonical form @xmath114 an important instance is the case @xmath115 : the canonical forms are such that @xmath116    liouville proved that if @xmath117 and @xmath118 are given by @xmath119 then the quotient @xmath120 is an invariant under the structure invariance group .",
    "the first canonical form corresponds to @xmath121 .",
    "any two equations with @xmath121 are in the same orbit , i.e. are related by the structure invariance group .    for equations with the second canonical form",
    "there is a new invariant , and they are in the same orbit if and only if the value of the invariant is the same for both equations .",
    "there exist a two - parameter structure invariance group for this type of equations in the case of first canonical form and a one - parameter one in the cases of the second form provided that an invariant has a constant value different from zero .",
    "lie s recipe for order reduction of second - order linear differential equations leads to some riccati equations .",
    "for instance @xmath122 under the change of variable @xmath123 becomes @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
    "similarly @xmath126 becomes under the same change of variable @xmath127 . on the other hand ,",
    "when comparing abel equation with riccati equation one sees that a possible generalization to second - order equation of abel equation is @xmath128 , where @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "the second - order abel equation ( [ abeleq2 ] ) can be presented as a system of two first - order equations @xmath130 corresponding to the following vector field on the velocity phase space @xmath131 @xmath132 such a nonlinear abel equation of second - order can be derived from the lagrangian @xmath133 the corresponding conserved energy function is given by @xmath134 to be remarked that there exists an alternative lagrangian given by : @xmath135 such lagrangians can be obtained by means of the jacobi last multiplier theory and darboux polynomials for polynomial vector fields .",
    "more specifically , darboux polynomials for a polynomial vector field @xmath136 are polynomials @xmath137 such that @xmath138 .",
    "the function @xmath72 is said to be the cofactor corresponding to such a darboux polynomial and the pair @xmath139 is called a darboux pair .    on the other side , given a vector field @xmath136 in an oriented manifold @xmath140 , a function @xmath141 such that @xmath142 is closed",
    "is said to be a jacobi multiplier ( jm ) for @xmath136 @xcite . recall that the divergence of the vector field @xmath136 ( with respect to the volume form @xmath143 ) is defined by the relation @xmath144 then , @xmath141 is a jacobi multiplier if and only if @xmath145 is a divergenceless vector field and therefore using @xmath146\\,\\omega=0\\,,\\ ] ] we see that @xmath141 is a last multiplier for @xmath136 if and only if @xmath147 because , for any function @xmath72 , @xmath148    the remarkable point is that if @xmath149 are darboux polynomials with corresponding cofactors @xmath150 , with @xmath151 , one can look for multiplier factors of the form @xmath152 and then @xmath153 consequently , if the coefficients @xmath154 can be chosen such that @xmath155 we arrive to @xmath156 what implies that @xmath141 is a jacobi last multiplier for @xmath136 .    finally , one can prove ( see e.g. @xcite ) that if @xmath141 is a jacobi multiplier for a vector field which corresponds to a second - order differential equation , there is an essentially unique lagrangian @xmath157 ( up to addition of a gauge term ) such that @xmath158 .    actually , helmholtz analysed the set of conditions that a multiplier matrix @xmath159 must satisfy in order for a given system of second - order equations @xmath160 or the corresponding system @xmath161 which provides us the integral curves for the vector field @xmath162 when written of the form @xmath163 to be the set of euler  lagrange equations for a certain lagrangian @xmath157 .",
    "the two first conditions just impose regularity and symmetry of the matrix @xmath164 ; the two other equations introduce relations between the derivatives of @xmath164 and the derivatives of the functions @xmath166 .",
    "the fourth set of conditions for @xmath164 is @xmath167 when the system is one - dimensional we have @xmath168 and then the three first set of conditions become trivial and the fourth one reduces to one single p.d.e .",
    "@xmath169 which is the equation defining the jacobi multipliers , because @xmath170 .",
    "then , the inverse problem reduces to find the function @xmath171 which is a jacobi multiplier and @xmath157 is obtained by integrating the function @xmath171 two times with respect to velocities .",
    "the function @xmath157 so obtained is unique up to addition of a gauge term .",
    "coming back to the second - order abel equation case , one can easily check that @xmath172 is a darboux polynomial for @xmath173 with cofactor @xmath174 since @xmath175 the divergence of the vector field @xmath173 is @xmath176 , and then we see that there is a jacobi multiplier of the form @xmath177 .",
    "consequently , the abel equation admits a lagrangian description by means of a function @xmath157 such that @xmath178 from where we obtain the lagrangian @xmath179 given by ( [ lagabel1 ] ) .",
    "but @xmath180 is also a darboux polynomial for @xmath173 with cofactor @xmath181 , @xmath182 and then we can find another jacobi multiplier of the form @xmath183 with @xmath184 .",
    "the abel equation admits a lagrangian description by means of a function @xmath157 such that @xmath185 from where we obtain the lagrangian @xmath186 given by ( [ lagabel2 ] ) .",
