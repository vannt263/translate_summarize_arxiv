    "although flamm s work on the wormhole physics dates back to 1916 , in connection with the newly found schwarzschild solution @xcite , wormhole solutions were firstly considered from physics standpoint by einstein and rosen ( er ) in 1935 , which is known today as einstein - rosen bridge connecting two identical space - times @xcite . then in 1955",
    "wheeler used `` geons '' ( self - gravitating bundles of electromagnetic fields ) by giving the first diagram of a doubly - connected - space @xcite .",
    "wheeler added the term `` wormhole '' to the physics literature , however he defined it at the quantum scale .",
    "after that , first traversable wormhole was proposed by morris - thorne in 1988 @xcite .",
    "then morris , thorne , and yurtsever investigated the requirements of the energy condition for wormholes morrisb .",
    "after while , visser constructed a technical way to make thin - shell wormholes which thoroughly surveyed the research landscape as of 1988 @xcite .",
    "after this , there are many papers written to support this idea @xcite .    in 1933",
    "f. zwicky , was the first astronomer to propose the existence of the dark matter ( dm ) after that he observed the motions of the galaxies in the coma cluster , a galaxy cluster roughly 320 million light - years away and nearly 2 light - years across , and found that it moved too rapidly @xcite .",
    "he noted that its speed of revolution , which depends on the weight and position of the objects inside , implied the cluster had much more mass than he could see .",
    "he decided there must be a hidden ingredient , known as dark matter , that caused the motions of these galaxies to be so large . in 1978 , american astronomer vera rubin looked at individual galaxies and she realized thet the outer stars were spinning as quickly as the interior stars , and sometimes faster @xcite .",
    "it is concluded that the galaxies must be surrounded by a halo of matter which is not seen .",
    "theorists have postulated many candidates for what dm might be .",
    "but the most widely accepted hypothesis is the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , a particle that interacts with gravity but not light , hence its invisibility to us @xcite .",
    "neither wimps nor any other particle that could successfully explain dm exist in the standard model of particle physics , the theoretical framework that has successfully predicted nearly all the phenomena in the universe .",
    "thus , the identity of the dm particle remains one of the outstanding mysteries in particle physics and cosmology . according to the latest results from the planck satellite @xcite , a mere 26.8% dm percent of the universe which plays a central role in modeling of cosmic structure , galaxy formation and evolution and on explanations of the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , 4.9% is made of ordinary matter which is matter composed of atoms or their constituents and 68.3% is dark energy ( de ) that tends to accelerate the expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "certain types of dm can actually help the formation of wormholes .",
    "for example , dissipative dm in which dm particles forming galactic halos are presumed to have dissipative self - interactions can aid the formation of black holes by dissipative collapse , and subsequent to wormholes .",
    "now , in this types of models one can consider either dm collapsed to a disk , or a quasi - isothermal profile fan1,fan2,foot , myr , kril .",
    "recently , rahaman et al . have used both the nfw navarro , raham22,raham23 @xmath0and urc dm density profiles @xcite @xmath1where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are all constants , to show the potentiality of the presence of traversable wormholes in the outer and the inner part , respectively , of the halo .    in this paper , following similar line of thought , we study the einasto model @xcite which is the special function that arranges the finest total fit to the halo density profiles .",

    "the difference between the einasto and nfw profiles appears at small and large radial distances .",
    "after all , on scales of concern for gas or stellar dynamics and strong gravitational lensing the einasto profile with @xmath20 is very akin to the nfw profile , and on scales of concern for weak gravitational lensing the einasto profile with @xmath21 is quite similar to the nfw profile .",

    "it is used to show the dm profiles of simulated halos as well as the nfw profile @xcite .",
    "the einasto profile has a finite ( zero ) central slope , in contrast to the nfw profile which has a divergent ( infinite ) central density . due to the restricted resolution of n - body simulations ,",
    "it is unclear yet which model description fit well to the central densities of simulated dm halo .",
    "the observations of both the milky way and some galaxies may be compatible with the nfw profile for the dm halo @xcite .",
    "there are also self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) simulations and baryon feedback simulations @xcite .",
    "the sidm is attractive because it offers a means to lower the central densities of galaxies without destroying the successes of cdm on large scales .",
    "cosmological simulations that contain only cdm indicate that dm haloes should be cuspy and with ( high ) concentrations that correlate with the collapse time of the halo .",
    "one possible answer is feedback in which the expulsion of gas from galaxies can result in lower dm densities compared to dissipationless simulations , and thus bring cdm models in line with observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore baryon feedback has most significant effects on the inner density profiles which are typically shallower than isothermal and the halo concentrations tend to be lower than in the absence of baryons .",
    "for instance the strong feedback models reduce the baryon fraction in galaxies by a factor of 3 relative to the case with no feedback @xcite .",
    "the dm profile of smaller galaxies tend to have flatter distributions of dm in the central region , known as the cuspy halo problem @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to search for possible traversable wormholes in a spiral galaxy specified by the einasto density profile .",
    "wormholes are solutions to einstein s equations that connect different universes or tunnels through different parts of the same universe .",
    "our primary aim is to consider the milky way galaxy as a test bed for this venture . to this end",
    "we choose the parameter @xmath4 of milky way to coincide with the throat of the traversable wormhole whereas the second parameter @xmath10 is in a restricted range . from the einstein equations we derive the equations for the density and pressures in terms of the metric functions and their derivatives .",
    "although our analytical functions are expressed in terms of the whittaker functions @xcite the detailed analysis are not imperative .",
    "it suffices for us to check the null - energy condition and satisfaction of the flare - out conditions @xcite .",
    "the same technical handicap prevents us to investigate the stability of the resulting traversable wormhole that may exist in the milky way galaxy .",
    "it is observed that at the central region einasto profile does not give a traversable wormhole  solution because violation of null energy condition is not satisfied there .",
    "but in the outward region we obtain possible traversable wormholes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the einstein equations for wormhole space - time and we find their solutions under the einasto dm profile . in section iii we discuss our results and conclude the paper .",
    "the spherically symmetric and static wormhole geometry which was proposed by morris - thorne is given by the line element @xcite @xmath23    where the function @xmath24 defines the spatial shape function , and @xmath25 stands for the redshift function .",
    "the radial coordinate r ranges from + @xmath26 to @xmath27(minimum radius condition that any wormhole must satisfy ) .",
    "the minimum value of the r is r@xmath28 called the throat of the wormhole .",

    "namely , we adapt the einasto density profile @xcite which differs much from the navarro- frenk- white ( nfw ) profile employed in @xcite .",
    "our analysis suggests accordingly that at the central region since the nec is not violated , we do not get any traversable wormholes .",
    "this explains also the choice of the throat outside of the central region .",
    "yet at the outer regions , the nec is violated so that the flare - out condition for traversable wormhole is satisfied and we expect formation of traversable wormholes .",
    "this result is not specific to milky way alone but is valid for any spiral galaxy once it obeys a mass distribution given by einosto profile .",
    "it is worthwhile therefore to check other mass distributions and see the resulting consequences . in conclusion",
    "we wish to comment that the dm lurking in the innermost part of the milky way @xcite , may support the existence of traversable wormholes that contains our solar system as well .",
