    "the experimental search for mass and nature of neutrinos through terrestrial as well as extra - terrestrial approaches has finally confirmed the neutrino oscillation in atmospheric @xcite , solar @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino sources and it has been established that neutrinos have mass .",
    "further , it is generally agreed that oscillations among three neutrino species are sufficient to explain the atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator neutrino puzzle .",
    "the neutrino oscillation experiments provide us with neutrino mass square differences @xmath18m@xmath19 , mixing angles and possible hierarchy in the neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "the global analysis of atmospheric , solar , reactor ( kam - land and chooz ) and accelarator ( k2k and minos ) neutrino oscillation data with 2@xmath20 ( 3@xmath20 ) error provides @xmath18m@xmath21 @xmath227.6@xmath2310@xmath24 ( 7.6@xmath2510@xmath24 ) ev@xmath19 , sin@xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) for solar neutrinos , @xmath18m@xmath28 @xmath222.4@xmath2910@xmath30 ( 2.4@xmath3110@xmath30 ) ev@xmath19 , sin@xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) for atmospheric neutrinos and @xmath34 @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the oscillation data also suggest that the neutrinos may belong to either normal hierarchy ( @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 ) or inverted hierarchy ( @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 ) .",
    "the data do not exclude the possibility that the mass of the light neutrino is much larger than @xmath42 and this implies the possible existence of quasi - degenerate neutrino mass spectrum i.e. @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath38 .",
    "however , the actual mass of neutrinos can not be extracted from these data . on the other hand",
    ", the study of tritium single @xmath45-decay and nuclear double-@xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) decay together can provide sharpest limits on the mass and nature of neutrinos .",
    "the nuclear @xmath47 decay is a rare second order semi - leptonic transition between two even @xmath48-even @xmath49 isobars @xmath50x and @xmath51y involving strangeness conserving charged weak currents .",
    "the implications of present studies about nuclear @xmath47 decay , which is expected to proceed through four experimentally distinguishable modes , namely the two neutrino double beta @xmath52 decay , neutrinoless double beta @xmath53 decay , single majoron accompanied @xmath54decay and double majoron accompanied @xmath55 decay are far reaching in nature .",
    "the half - life of @xmath56 decay is a product of accurately known phase space factor and appropriate nuclear transition matrix element ( ntme ) @xmath57 .",
    "it has been already measured in the case of @xmath58 decay for about ten nuclei out of 35 possible candidates @xcite .",
    "hence , the values of ntmes @xmath57 can be extracted directly .",
    "consequently , the validity of different models employed for nuclear structure calculations can be tested by calculating the @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath59 decay , which violates the conservation of lepton number , can occur in a number of gauge theoretical models , namely guts -left - right symmetric models and e(6)- , r@xmath60-conserving as well as violating susy models , in the scenarios of leptoquark exchange , existence of heavy sterile neutrino , compositeness and majoron models .",
    "hence , it is a convenient tool to test the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in particular for the question whether the neutrino is a majorana or dirac particle ,",
    "the @xmath61 decay is considered to be the most sensitive way of distinguishing between these two possibilities .",
    "the experimental as well as theoretical developments in the study of nuclear @xmath47 decay have been excellently reviewed over the past years @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 decay has not been observed so far and the best observed limit on half - life @xmath62 yr for @xmath63ge has been achieved in the heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite .",
    "klapdor and his group have recently reported that @xmath0 decay has been observed in @xmath63ge and @xmath64 yr @xcite .",
    "however , it is felt that the latter result needs independent verification @xcite .",
    "the aim of all the present experimental activities is to observe the @xmath65 decay .",
    "hence , the models predict half - lives assuming certain value for the neutrino mass or conversely extract various parameters from the observed limits of the half - lives of @xmath66 decay .",
    "the reliability of predictions can be judged a priori only from the success of a nuclear model in explaining various observed physical properties of nuclei .",
    "the common practice is to calculate the @xmath57 to start with and compare them with the experimentally observed value as the two decay modes involve the same set of initial and final nuclear wave functions although the structure of nuclear transition operators are quite different . over the past few years , the @xmath61 decay has been studied mainly in three types of models , namely shell model and its variants , the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and its extensions and alternative models . in the recent past ,",

    "the nuclei are soft vibrators for neutron number @xmath71 and quasi - rotors for @xmath72 .",

    "nuclei range from spherical to well deformed , with large static quadrupole moments . in the mass region @xmath67 of our interest ,",
    "the experimental deformation parameter @xmath76 varies from @xmath77 to @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the lowest and highest @xmath76 values correspond to @xmath79zr and @xmath6nd respectively .",
    "it is well known that the pairing part of the interaction ( _ p _ ) accounts for the sphericity of nucleus , whereas the quadrupole - quadrupole ( _ qq _ ) interaction increases the collectivity in the nuclear intrinsic wave functions and makes the nucleus deformed .",
    "hence , it is expected that subtle interplay of pairing and deformation degrees of freedom will play a crucial role in reproducing the properties of nuclei in this mass region .",
    "all the nuclei undergoing @xmath47 decay are even - even type , in which the pairing degrees of freedom play an important role .",
    "moreover , it has been already conjectured that the deformation can play a crucial role in case of @xmath80 decay of @xmath81mo and @xmath6nd isotopes @xcite .",
    "hence , it is desirable to have a model which incorporates the pairing and deformation degrees of freedom on equal footing in its formalism .    in the light of above discussions ,",
    "the phfb model is one of the most natural choices .",
    "however , it is not possible to study the structure of odd - odd nuclei in the present version of the phfb model . hence , the single @xmath45-decay rates and the distribution of gamow - teller strength can not be calculated . on the other hand",
    ", the study of these processes has implications in the understanding of the role of the isoscalar part of the proton - neutron interaction .",
    "this is a serious draw back in the present formalism of the phfb model .",
    "notwithstanding , the phfb model in conjunction with the summation method has been successfully applied to the @xmath82 decay of @xmath1zr , @xmath83mo , @xmath84ru and @xmath4pd @xcite , @xmath5te and @xmath6nd @xcite isotopes for the @xmath85 transition not in isolation but together with other observed nuclear spectroscopic properties , namely yrast spectra , reduced @xmath86 transition probabilities , static quadrupole moments and @xmath87-factors .",
    "the success of the phfb model in conjunction with the _ ppqq _ interaction in explaining @xmath58 decay as well as the above mentioned nuclear properties in the mass range @xmath67 has prompted us to apply the same to study the @xmath0 decay of the same nuclei for the 0@xmath880@xmath89 transition .",
    "further , the phfb model using the _ ppqq _ interaction is a convenient choice to examine the explicit role of deformation on ntmes @xmath90 in the case of @xmath17 decay , we have observed that the deformation plays an important role in the quenching of @xmath57 by a factor of approximately 2 to 6 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we also study the variation of ntmes of @xmath0 decay vis - a - vis the change in deformation through the changing strength of the _ qq _ interaction .",
    "our aim is to extract limits on the effective mass of light as well as heavy neutrinos from the study of the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1zr , @xmath83mo , @xmath3ru , @xmath4pd , @xmath5te and @xmath6nd isotopes for the 0@xmath880@xmath89 transition .",
