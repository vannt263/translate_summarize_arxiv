    "asteroseismology allows us to probe below the photosphere and into the interiors of stars .",
    "there are many pulsational instability strips on the hertzsprung - russell diagram , including the dav ( or zz ceti ) instability strip , driven by a hydrogen partial ionization zone in the hydrogen atmosphere ( da ) wds .",
    "seismology using the non - radial @xmath7-mode pulsations of davs enables us to constrain the mass , core and envelope composition , rotation rate , and the behavior of convection in these objects ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the mass distribution of da wds in the sdss shows a strong peak at 0.6 @xmath5with tails toward higher and lower masses @xcite ; masses of individual wds range from about 0.2 @xmath5  to 1.3 @xmath5 .",
    "the roughly 150 davs known to date have masses @xmath8 @xmath5 , implying they all likely contain c / o - cores .",
    "lower mass wds are likely to pulsate as well .",
    "however , previous searches have failed to detect such pulsations @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is not old enough to produce low mass ( @xmath9 @xmath5 ) wds through single - star evolution ; these wds are believed to be the product of binary evolution .",
    "indeed , radial velocity surveys of low - mass wds indicate that most form in binary systems @xcite .",
    "many short - period binaries go through one or two common - envelope phases , which may effectively remove enough mass to prevent ignition of he to c / o . however , there is little direct evidence that low - mass wds have he - cores .",
    "but if they pulsate , as do their c / o - core brethren , we may differentiate their interior structure .",
    "we have been engaged in an ongoing search for low - mass davs for many years at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the benefits of a search for a low - mass ( and putatively he - core ) dav were recently emphasized by @xcite .",
    "should they pulsate in @xmath7-modes like the c / o - core davs , the eigenfunctions of elm wds would globally sample the interior , making the pulsations sensitive to core composition .",
    "seismology may also allow us to constrain the hydrogen layer mass ; this is vitally important since hydrogen burning is expected to be a major or even dominant component of the luminosity of these stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite outlined the null results of a search for pulsations in 12 low - mass wds .",
    "we have extended a similar , systematic search for variable he - core wds , armed with the many dozens of new extremely low - mass ( elm , @xmath10 @xmath5 ) wds catalogued by the elm survey @xcite .",
    "that search has yielded its first success .    in this letter , we report the discovery of pulsations in the elm wd sdss j184037.78 + 642312.3 , and show that the photometric variations are likely multi - periodic .",
    "we have also included our null results for another eight low - mass wds that were observed not to vary , to various detection limits .",
    "@xcite present the spectroscopic discovery data for j1840 from the blue channel spectrograph on the 6.5 m mmt .",
    "they use 37 separate spectra over more than a year to determine the system parameters .",
    "@xcite find that j1840 is in a @xmath11 hr ( @xmath12 s ) orbital period binary with a @xmath13 km s@xmath14  radial velocity semi - amplitude .",
    "however , a significant alias exists at 3.85 hr .",
    "model fits to the co - added spectra for j1840 yield @xmath0  @xmath15 k and @xmath2  @xmath16 , which correspond to a mass of roughly 0.17 @xmath5 . given the mass function of the system , @xmath17 @xmath5 , the minimum mass of the unseen companion is 0.64 @xmath5 ; if the orbital inclination is random , there is a 70% probability that the companion is a wd with @xmath18 @xmath5 .",
    "we note , however , that the nature of the unseen companion has no bearing on the impact of this letter .",
    "we obtained high speed photometric observations of j1840 at the mcdonald observatory over three consecutive nights in 2011 october , for a total of more than 5.5 hr of coverage .",
    "we used the argos instrument , a frame - transfer ccd mounted at the prime focus of the 2.1 m otto struve telescope @xcite , to obtain many 15 s exposures on this @xmath19 mag wd .",
    "the seeing averaged 1.5  and transparency variations were low , although our second and third nights were cut short by clouds .",
    "observations were obtained through a 1 mm bg40 filter to reduce sky noise .",
    "we performed weighted aperture photometry on the calibrated frames using the external iraf package @xmath20 written by antonio kanaan ( the reduction method is outlined in @xcite ) .",
    "we divided the sky - subtracted light curves by five brighter comparison stars in the field to allow for fluctuations in seeing and cloud cover , and applied a timing correction to each observation to account for the motion of the earth around the barycenter of the solar system @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : j1840lc ] shows all @xmath21 argos light curve points obtained for j1840 from 25 oct 2011 to 27 oct 2011 .",
    "we also include the light curve of the brightest comparison star in the field , sdss j184043.21 + 642351.8 , for reference .",
    "our photometric data set is relatively short , as we caught j1840 just before it went behind the sun .",
    "this limits the significance of the detected periods , and we eagerly anticipate further observations . still , we have sufficient data to show convincingly that this low - mass wd is a multi - periodic variable star .",

    "the highest peak in a fourier transform ( ft ) of the brightest companion star in the field yields only a small signal ( 0.24% amplitude ) at @xmath23  s , consistent with low - frequency noise from atmospheric variability .",
    "our apertures and sky annuli have been chosen to ensure there is no significant contamination from the nearby star sdss j184038.73 + 642315.6 , which is 7.0  away from our target .",
    "thus the signal we are observing is intrinsic to the wd . without evidence for a companion star or accretion from the spectra , the light curves , or existing broadband photometry , we are confident that the photometric variability results from pulsations on the surface of the elm wd .",
    "the pulse shape appears non - sinusoidal , with a steep rise and decline .",
    "we first test whether a single mode ( @xmath24 ) and its harmonics ( @xmath25 ) could reproduce the observed light curve .",
    "a nonlinear least squares fit with the highest peak in the ft and its fixed harmonics converges on 225.03 @xmath26hz  ( 4444 s ) as the best parent mode ( see the bottom of table  [ tab : freq ] for a full solution ) .    however , our data from multiple nights rule out this scenario .",
    "the single - mode harmonic solution fits the two peaks during the first night well , but it fails to match the peak in our second night of data , predicting a maximum in the light curve more than 500 s too soon .",
    "a multi - mode solution ( see the top panels of table  [ tab : freq ] ) where the frequencies are determined from the highest amplitudes in an ft of the entire dataset ( see figure  [ fig : j1840 ft ] ) improves the residuals by more than 20% . for more realistic estimates , the cited errors are not formal least - squares errors to the data but rather the product of @xmath27 monte carlo simulations of perturbed data using the software package period04 @xcite .",
    "the signal - to - noise calculation is based on the average amplitude of a 1000 @xmath26hz  box after pre - whitening by the three significant , highest - amplitude frequencies .",
    "a small but possibly significant amount of power remains around 254 and 859 @xmath26hz  after prewhitening by the three significant periodicities ( with s / n @xmath28 ) , so we have included a frequency solution with these additional periods in table  [ tab : freq ] .",
    "this set of period solutions is by no means exhaustive , but it establishes that this elm wd is variable and multi - periodic .",
    "we announce the discovery of the first pulsating extremely low mass white dwarf , j1840 , which is both the coolest and lowest - mass wd known to pulsate .",
    "the object offers , for the first time , an opportunity to explore the interior of a putative he - core wd using asteroseismology .",
    "asteroseismology of elm wds will help constrain the thickness of the surface hydrogen layers in these low - mass wds .",
    "there are several millisecond pulsars with elm wd companions , and the cooling ages of such companions can be used to calibrate the spin - down ages of these pulsars",
    ". however , current evolutionary models for elm wds are relatively unconstrained . for masses @xmath29 ,",
    "diffusion - induced hydrogen - shell flashes take place , which yield small hydrogen envelopes @xcite .",
    "the models with @xmath30 do not experience thermonuclear flashes . as a result",
    ", they have massive hydrogen envelopes , larger radii , lower surface gravities , and they are predicted to evolve much more slowly compared to more massive wds .",
    "if enough modes are excited to observability , we hope to directly constrain the hydrogen layer mass .",
    "a plethora of excited modes would also allow for measuring the mean period spacing , which is a sensitive function of the mass of the star , and is also slightly dependent on the core mass fraction .",
    "the models of @xcite found a mean period spacing of @xmath31 s for @xmath32 @xmath7-modes of a 0.17 @xmath5  elm wd , about a factor of two larger than the observed @xmath33 s period spacing for @xmath32 @xmath7-modes in the cool c / o - core counterpart g29 - 38 @xcite .",
    "we do expect this non - radial pulsator to be multi - periodic even if just one pulsation mode and its non - linear harmonics are amplified to observability : j1840 is in a relatively close binary with an unseen compact object .",
    "this companion will influence the light curve in many ways .",
    "although we lack the sensitivity and full phase coverage needed for a detection , we expect a @xmath34% amplitude doppler beaming signal at the orbital period given the effective temperature of j1840 and the radial - velocity amplitude @xcite .",
    "the companion will also induce tidal distortions on the primary , as seen in many other elm wds @xcite .",
    "however , assuming that j1840 has a radius of roughly 0.054 @xmath35  @xcite , ellipsoidal variations should be smaller than 0.1% for even the highest possible inclinations @xcite .",
    "the companion s effect on the rotation period is perhaps more significant .",
    "the @xmath36 gyr cooling age of this elm wd @xcite may be longer than the synchronization timescale for such a short - period binary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if so , and the elm wd is rotating at the orbital period of 4.6 hr , then non - radial pulsations will be subsequently subject to rotational splittings determined by their modal degree .",
    "for example , if the 225 @xmath26hz  mode is an @xmath37 mode , a 4.6 hr rotation rate would cause it to be split by about 30 @xmath26hz , assuming solid - body rotation @xcite . however , synchronization is not a guarantee : recent _ kepler _ observations of a close sdb+dm binary found the primary rotating much slower than the @xmath38 hr orbital period @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the rotational splittings in the pulsations of j1840 will test tidal synchronization in this system , thereby probing the rigidness of this elm wd .",
    "we also hope to use the nonlinearities in this non - sinusoidal light curve to constrain the size of the convection zone of this wd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since elm wds exist in a completely new regime of parameter space than do typical c / o core wds , this analysis will provide important independent constraints on the structure of their outer layers , as well as providing a measure of the convective efficiency in this new regime .",
    "we discovered the pulsations in j1840 as part of a systematic search for pulsations in low - mass wds , recently energized by the work of @xcite .",
    "we have explored a vast area of the @xmath2   @xmath0  parameter space for variability ( see figure  [ fig : search ] ) , and compiled a list of our first eight null results in table  [ tab : null ] .",
    "these null observations were reduced and analyzed in an identical manner to those outlined in section  [ sec : obs ] , and the atmospheric parameters and their formal errors were determined by the references cited .",

    "we note , however , that the driving mechanism for pulsation is largely unknown for this star .",
    "it is natural to assume that the same mechanism of convective driving that operates in the c / o - core davs @xcite is also responsible for the pulsations of low - mass wds .",
    "this mechanism is based on the assumption that the convective turnover timescale for a fluid element , @xmath58 , is much smaller than the oscillation periods , @xmath59 . for the @xmath60 davs , @xmath611  sec and @xmath621000  sec , so @xmath63 is satisfied .",
