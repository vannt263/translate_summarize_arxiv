    "metamagnetism is usually understood as a rapid increase of the magnetization of a given system in a narrow range of magnetic fields . in a spin localized picture",
    ", it would correspond to the field - induced suppression of , for instance , antiferromagnetic order via a spin - flop or the subsequent spin - flip transition @xcite . in itinerant systems ,",
    "metamagnetism is explained either in terms of the field - induced spin - polarization of the fermi surface and concomitant field - tuned proximity of the fermi level to a van - hove singularity @xcite or in terms of the suppression of antiferromagnetic correlations @xcite .",
    "so far , both itinerant metamagnetic scenarios have been discussed within a single band picture @xcite .",
    "the ruthenates , sr@xmath1ru@xmath3o@xmath4 in particular , were reported to display complex metamagnetic behavior , including the possibility of quantum - criticality by tuning to zero temperature the end point of a first - order metamagnetic transition @xcite . at low temperatures and in high purity samples , this first - order line bifurcates into two first - order transitions that define the boundary of a new phase @xcite emerging at the quantum - critical end point which is claimed to result from the coupling of lattice fluctuations to a fermi surface instability @xcite .",
    "complex and highly anisotropic metamagnetic behavior has also been recently reported in the tri - layered sr@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath2 compound @xcite which is a structurally distorted ferromagnet : the ruo@xmath7 octahedra in the outer two layers of each triple layer are rotated by an average of @xmath8 around the c - axis , while the octahedra of the inner layers are rotated in the opposite sense by an average of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it displays a curie temperature @xmath10 k ( see upper panel of fig . 1 which shows the temperature dependence of both the heat capacity @xmath11 normalized respect to the temperature @xmath12 as well as the low field magnetization @xmath13 ) and a saturated moment @xmath14 per ru@xmath15 ion , which raman spectroscopy suggests to be _ localized _ in the ru site @xcite and directed essentially along the c - axis @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition is followed by an additional broad peak in the magnetic susceptibility at @xmath16 k in flux grown samples @xcite ( @xmath17 k in floating zone grown crystals ) which is claimed to result from the  locking \" of the moments into a canted antiferromagnetic configuration @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , neutron scattering experiments indeed find the moments lying in the ab - plane but coupled ferromagnetically @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath18 , shown in fig .",
    "1 , displaying a ferromagnetic transition followed by a broad maximum as the temperature is lowered , is consistent with the reentrance of the paramagnetic state at lower temperatures , a conventional behavior of itinerant metamagnetic systems close to a van hove singularity @xcite .",
    "here we show that sr@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath2 displays clear evidence for metamagnetic behavior involving simultaneously several of the bands associated with the @xmath19 orbitals .",
    "figure 2 ( a ) displays the magnetization @xmath13 of a sr@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath2 single - crystal measured with a commercial squid magnetometer as a function of the field @xmath20 at @xmath21 k and for several values of the angle @xmath22 between @xmath20 and the c - axis .",
    "when @xmath20 is applied along an in - plane direction , ( @xmath23 ) it exhibits a sharp and hysteretic metamagnetic transition at a critical field @xmath24",
    "t @xcite . in high quality single crystals",
    "the observed hysteresis exhibits ultra - sharp steps in the resistivity resulting from domain formation @xcite .",
    "but as @xmath22 decreases , as indicated by the vertical arrows , the transition clearly occurs via an anisotropic two - step process . a first step in @xmath13",
    "is observed at @xmath25 t and moves to lower fields as @xmath22 decreases leading at high angles and above a field of just @xmath26 t , to a saturation value @xmath27 @xmath28 per ru .",
    "notice that according to hund s rule , the placement of the four ru@xmath29 carriers on the three @xmath30 @xmath19 orbitals leads to an effective moment @xmath31 or @xmath32 @xmath28 per ru . if the lattice distortions in sr@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath2 do not lift the degeneracy among the three @xmath19 orbitals , one would expect each orbital to contribute 2/3 of a @xmath28 per ru to the total moment",
    ". thus a saturation value of @xmath33 @xmath28 per ru , suggests the polarization of the moments in _ two _ of the @xmath19 orbital networks . while a second step is observed in the magnetization when @xmath34 and moves to much higher fields as @xmath22 decreases producing considerable hysteresis .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by measurements of the magnetic torque @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is the total number of ru atoms ) measured by using a thin film cube cantilever ( 5/1000 of an inch in thickness ) at @xmath37 k shown in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) . notice how sharp and hysteretic this second metamagnetic transition is .",
    "its sharpness is a very strong indication of the high quality of our samples .",
    "remarkably , at low angles this second metamagnetic transition occurs under a sizeable component of @xmath20 applied along the inter - plane direction , or with the moments basically aligned along the c - axis by the first transition .    in order to understand this complex metamagnetic behavior , particularly the high field metamagnetic transition",
    ", we performed electrical transport measurements at very high magnetic fields and low temperatures in two batches of single crystals , one having a residual resistivity @xmath38 cm , where we performed inter - plane transport measurements , and a second one displaying a @xmath39 between 1.5 and 2 @xmath40 cm used mainly for in - plane transport studies .",
    "our goal is two - fold : i ) to measure the evolution of the geometry of the fermi surface and of the quasiparticles effective mass across the high field metamagnetic transition via the shubnikov - de - haas effect , to explore the possibility of itinerant metamagnetism , ii ) to determine the geometry of the fermi surface in order to stimulate band structure calculations which could clarify the possible existence of localized bands .",
    "our crystals were grown by a floating - zone ( fz ) technique @xcite .",
    "crystals selected for the measurements were characterized by x - ray diffraction , heat capacity , and magnetization measurements and were found to be pure sr@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath2 .",
    "for instance , in fig . 1 ,",
    "only one weak anomaly is seen in @xmath41 at @xmath42 k indicating the onset of ferromagnetism .",
    "no clear anomaly is seen that one could associate with the proposed spin canting transition @xcite or with the existence of inclusions of other phases .",
    "the absence of inclusions , as seen for example in self - flux grown samples @xcite , is confirmed by measurements of the magnetization @xmath13 as a function of @xmath12 for a field of @xmath43 gauss applied along an in - plane direction , also shown in fig . 1 .",
    "one sees only a couple of anomalies , one at @xmath44 and a second one at 140 k which does not leave any clear signature in @xmath41 .",
    "inclusions of srruo@xmath1 would produce an anomaly at @xmath45 k and would lead to a rapid increase in @xmath13 when low fields are applied along the ab - plane , contrary to what is seen respectively in figs . 1 and 2(a ) .",
    "electrical transport measurements were performed by using conventional four - probe techniques in conjunction with a single axis - rotator inserted in a @xmath46he cryostat .",
    "high magnetic fields up to 45 t were provided by the nhmfl .",
    "figure 3 ( a ) shows the inter - plane resistivity @xmath47 for two sr@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath2 single crystals ( typical dimensions @xmath48 mm@xmath49 ) at @xmath50 k as a function of @xmath20 and for several angles @xmath22 between @xmath20 and the inter - plane c - axis .",
    "notice both , the oscillations in @xmath47 or the shubnikov de haas ( sdh ) effect , and the marked negative magnetoresistivity _ emerging from the second metamagnetic transition _ seen at higher fields .",
    "for @xmath51 , for example , the metamagnetic transition field is @xmath52 34 t ( blue trace ) , and is displaced to fields beyond 45 t as the field is aligned along the c - axis .",
    "figure 3 ( b ) displays the oscillatory component or the sdh signal ( defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the inverse of the background resistivity ) of the trace shown in ( a ) ( @xmath51 ) as a function of the inverse field @xmath56 . both the amplitude and the frequency of the oscillatory component changes drastically at @xmath57 t as quantified by the fast fourier transform of the sdh signal taken in two limited field ranges , i.e. , from 11.5 to 32 t ( or below @xmath58 ) in blue and from 34 to 45 t ( or above @xmath58 ) in magenta , both shown in fig .",
    "the peak seen at @xmath59 t @xcite is completely suppressed by the transition implying the reconstruction of the fermi surface .",
    "a more thorough investigation of the effect of the transition on the fermi surface is given by measurements of the in - plane magnetoresistivity @xmath60 in the highest quality single crystals of sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 ( dimensions @xmath61 mm@xmath49 ) currently available .",
    "as an example of typical raw data we show in fig .",
    "4 the in - plane resistivity as a function of the external field in a limited range , i.e. , between 30 and 45 t at @xmath62 k , and for an angle @xmath63 .",
    "the sdh oscillations are clearly visible although the metamagnetic transition is barely perceptible .",
    "notice how sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 is extremely anisotropic , @xmath64 , consequently one should expect to observe nearly two - dimensional fermi surface sheets . figure 5 ( a ) shows the sdh signal obtained from the trace of @xmath60 in fig .",
    "4 . according to fig .",
    "2 ( a ) , at this angle under a field of 7 t the net moment is nearly saturated to a value of @xmath65 @xmath66 . while from our previous angular study in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) , at this angle one expects the metamagnetic transition to happen in the neighborhood of 35 t. one can clearly see that the oscillatory pattern changes in the neighborhood of 36 t. in fig . 5 ( b ) we display the fft spectrum of the sdh signal for two ranges of magnetic field , i.e. , from 25 to 30 t or clearly below the metamagnetic transition ( in magenta ) , and from 40 to 45 t where the geometry of the fermi surface is closer to being stable ( in blue ) .",
    "larger frequencies such as the one at @xmath67 kt and those around 4 kt , remain unaffected by the transition .",
    "however the entire spectral weight below 2 kt is shifted towards higher frequencies .",
    "this situation is somewhat similar to that reported in the bi - layered compound sr@xmath1ru@xmath3o@xmath4 where the fft spectrum reveals additional structure and small shifts in the frequency of the main peaks across its metamagnetic transition which are claimed to result from the spin - splitting of the fermi surface @xcite . in figure 5 ( c )",
    "we plot the effective mass @xmath68 in units of free electron mass @xmath69 , associated with the peak observed at @xmath70 kt and as a function of @xmath20 . here",
    "we measured @xmath71 at different temperatures and extracted the corresponding fft spectrum within a narrow window in @xmath72 .",
    "the evolution of the amplitude of a given peak in frequency as a function of temperature was fitted to the usual lifshitz - kosevich expression @xmath73 to extract @xmath68 .",
    "notice how the value of @xmath68 spikes at @xmath74 t , a behavior similar to that of sr@xmath1ru@xmath3o@xmath4 and which is claimed to result from the fluctuations emerging from a metamagnetic quantum - critical end point @xcite . a metamagnetic quantum - critical end point in the context of itinerant metamagnetism has also been predicted for sr@xmath5ru@xmath6o@xmath2 @xcite but more work is needed to clarify its existence . in any case , the enhancement of effective mass is also consistent with the scenario of a zeeman - split fermi surface that crosses a nearby van - hove singularity as the field increases , i.e. , conventional itinerant metamagnetic scenario .    in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 the amplitude of the oscillations",
    "is quickly damped as @xmath22 increases .",
    "however , we were able to fit ( not shown here ) the angular dependence of the main peaks corresponding respectively to 1.9 , 3.95 , and 9.96 kt , and which are associated with largest cross - sectional areas of the fermi surface , to the expression @xmath75 , indicating their two - dimensional character . instead , lower frequencies such as the @xmath25 kt display a linear dependence .",
    "although one could naively expect sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 to display a nearly three - dimensional fermi surface due to its structural proximity to the infinite layered compound srruo@xmath1 , the two - dimensional character of its main fs sheets agrees well with its highly anisotropic electrical transport properties .",
    "finally , the effective masses associated with these orbits averaged over our entire field range are @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the 1.02 , 1.9 . 3.95 and 9.96 kt frequencies , respectively .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the metamagnetic behavior observed in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 _ bifurcates into two transitions _ as the external field rotates away from the conducting planes .",
    "a first step observed in the magnetization , which results from the alignment of moments in ferromagnetic bands , moves to fields well below 1 t and leads to a large polarized moment of 1.3 @xmath28 per ru when an external field is applied nearly along the c - axis .",
    "while a second magnetization step shows a pronounced angular dependence and moves to fields beyond 45 t when it is applied nearly along the inter - plane axis .",
    "the enhancement of the quasiparticles effective mass and the change in the geometry of the fermi surface at the transition , are indications of its itinerant metamagnetic character .",
    "we conclude that metamagnetism in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 is an orbital - dependent process involving both the alignment of moments / domains in ferromagnetic bands that are either itinerant or localized , and the polarization of an itinerant band that is in close proximity to a van - hove singularity .",
    "one possible scenario is that the external field applied along the ab - plane aligns the fm moments / domains producing a large internal field that couples to the lattice via magneto - elastic coupling .",
    "the concomitant changes in lattice constants could lead to the itinerant metamagnetic response .",
    "but as the field is rotated away from an in - plane direction , the metamagnetic transition would occur whenever the sum of the in - plane components of the internal field ( which progressively tilts towards the c - axis ) and the external field is equal to the sum of both fields when @xmath80 ab - plane . in any case",
    ", the complex and simultaneous involvement of several bands in the magnetic response has yet to be considered by theoretical treatments of metamagnetism @xcite .",
    "we owe this complex physical behavior to the multi - band nature of this compound .",
    "orbital - dependent superconductivity in sr@xmath3ruo@xmath0 @xcite and the proposed orbital - selective mott transition in the ca@xmath81sr@xmath82ruo@xmath0 system @xcite are other examples of possible multi - band behavior in the ruthenates .",
    "band structure calculations for sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 would be highly desirable since a comparison with our experimental fermi surface determination could clarify the proposed existence of localized bands @xcite .",
