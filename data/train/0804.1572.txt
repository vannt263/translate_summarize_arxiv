    "the radiative decays of the @xmath0 meson are a valuable tool to study the nature of light scalar states below 1 gev @xcite .",
    "it is still debated if the latter are quarkonia @xcite , tetraquark @xcite , molecular states @xcite or a mixing of these configurations @xcite .",
    "a dominant quarkonium assignment is problematic @xcite , thus leading to identify the @xmath5-states with resonances above 1 gev where mixing with the scalar glueball takes place @xcite .    in this article",
    "we do not employ a particular interpretation for the resonances @xmath6 and @xmath7 . independently on their nature , spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry implies that derivative couplings to the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 arise .",
    "in fact , the latter states are the emerging goldstone bosons , which can be rewritten as angular excitations .",
    "then , lagrangian interactions of derivative type with schematic form @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are obtained @xcite .",
    "our aim is to study in detail the effects of such derivative interactions on the line shapes of the reactions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , occurring via virtual @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons respectively .    in order to discuss properly the issue",
    "we concentrate on the reaction @xmath18 via a virtual @xmath16 state .",
    "we first write down explicitly the general interaction lagrangian of the @xmath16 meson with pions and kaons as emerging upon chiral symmetry breaking within the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry as obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite:@xmath19 where dots refer to the analogous terms with the neutral kaon states . in the chiral limit",
    "the pion and the kaon masses @xmath20 and @xmath21 vanish leaving only interactions with derivatives parametrized by the coupling constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 parametrize the interaction without derivatives .",
    "now , the radiative decay @xmath18 via @xmath16 can occur essentially in two ways :    \\(a ) an interaction lagrangian for the decay @xmath26 is introduced as @xmath27where @xmath28 is the electromagnetic field strength and @xmath29 is the field strength related to the vector field @xmath30 the interaction lagrangian @xmath31 parameterized by @xmath32 corresponds to a point - like coupling which effectively takes into account loops of quarks ( whose precise form depends on the microscopic interpretation of the @xmath16 meson ) .",
    "after the transition @xmath26 the scalar meson @xmath16 decays into pions ( as depicted in fig .",
    "1.c ) via derivative couplings ( mechanism a.1 , whose amplitude is proportional to @xmath33 or via non - derivative couplings ( mechanism a.2 , proportional to @xmath24 ) . a first study of derivative interactions ( thus setting @xmath34 ) has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown by using breit - wigner propagators for the scalars that derivative couplings describe the data better than non - derivative ones . a detailed study involving non - derivative interactions only ( setting @xmath35 has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "\\(b ) the vector meson @xmath0 couples strongly to kaons .",
    "then , via a kaon - loop a photon is generated at one vertex and a @xmath16 meson at the other vertex .",
    "the latter coupling can again occur in two ways : via derivative coupling ( mechanism b.1 , proportional to @xmath36 see ref .",
    "@xcite ) or via non derivative coupling ( mechanism b.2 , proportional to @xmath37 see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    note that all these considerations apply also for the @xmath17 meson as a virtual state of the reaction @xmath15 : the derivative ( non - derivative ) interactions with @xmath38 and @xmath39 are parameterized by @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) in a lagrangian which is analogous to eq .",
    "( [ f01 ] ) .",
    "clearly , the possible decay mechanisms are also separated into a.1 and a.2 ( direct , non - structure coupling ) and via kaon loops ( b.1 and b.2 ) .",
    "it is evident that the description of the radiative decay @xmath44 ( and @xmath45 is difficult because four decay mechanisms ( a.1 , a.2 and b.1 , b.2 ) can potentially contribute and it is not clear @xmath46 @xmath47 which one is dominant . as a consequence , considering that the inclusion of all contributions at the same time has not yet been performed , the extraction of the parameters of eq .",
    "( [ f01 ] ) from experiments depends also on theoretical assumptions .",
    "mechanism ( b ) is a mesonic 1-loop contribution to the decay mechanism , which is regarded as dominant by many authors in view of the large coupling to kaons of the vector meson @xmath0 meson and of the scalars @xmath2 and @xmath48 however , notice that the mechanism ( a ) is dominant according to large - n@xmath49 counting rule both in the tetraquark and quarkonium assignments for the @xmath1 meson and in the tetraquark assignment for the @xmath2 @xcite ( see also the note to this reference ) . while it is not yet clear to which extent large - n@xmath49 is reliable in this context -see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this point- , we consider this fact as a motivation to study in detail the effects of the mechanism ( a ) on radiative decays and thus to test an alternative scenario for the description of radiative @xmath0 decays . moreover , in this work we restrict to the chiral limit dominant mechanism a.1 where only derivatives are involved ( corresponding to setting @xmath50 ) .",
    "we thus intend to continue the analysis initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite about derivative interactions by studying the decay mechanism a.1 in both the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 channels in relation to radiative @xmath0 decays .",
    "we aim to do it by properly taking into account loops and finite - width effects using the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite extended to the case of derivative couplings .",
    "that is , both real and imaginary parts of self - energy contributions ( which show a rather different behavior than their non - derivative counterparts , see fig .",
    "2 ) are taken into account .",
    "we regularize the model by using an effective cutoff of the order of @xmath51 gev which is introduced by using a nonlocal extension of eq .",
    "( [ f01 ] ) .",
    "we conclude this discussion by noting that the neglect of the non - derivative coupling is surely justified in virtue of the small pion mass in the @xmath52 channel of @xmath16 but is less justified in @xmath38 channel of @xmath17 and in the kaon - kaon channel of both resonances because of the larger masses of the @xmath10 and @xmath9 mesons",
    ". the next step shall be the inclusions of mechanism a.2 .",
    "but at the present stage a fit with non - zero @xmath53 s and @xmath54 s at the same time would not be constrained enough .",
    "quite remarkably , our analysis shows that derivative interactions alone work well in the description of both @xmath18 and @xmath15 line shapes as experimentally measured in the snd and kloe collaborations in refs .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath16 meson and in refs .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath17 meson .",
    "the peaked line shapes can be reproduced in virtue of the derivative coupling which enhance the theoretical curves close to threshold .",
    "we also compare our results with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath16 meson has been studied studied in @xmath55 decays at bes , and with ref .",
    "@xcite , in which an experimental analysis of the crystal barrel data for the @xmath17 meson has been performed , see also refs .",
    "however , we shall also point out that care is needed when extracting the coupling constants of scalar - to - pseudoscalar from radiative @xmath0 decays alone because of strong correlations of the parameters entering in the fit .",
    "in particular , the difficulty is due to the the fact that , if the decay mechanism ( a ) is dominant , an extraction of @xmath23 ( and eventually @xmath56 from the line shapes of @xmath18 reaction is hard because @xmath23 and @xmath25 appear only in the denominator of the propagator of @xmath16 and are not directly proportional to decay amplitude(s ) .",
    "( this is not the case for mechanism b , where the kaon - loop amplitudes are directly proportional to @xmath23 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "a similar discussion holds in the @xmath17 case . for this reason we did not include the coupling to kaons as free parameter of the fit but we repeated the analysis for different values of the latter checking how the fit is affected .    as a comparison",
    "we also perform the fit using non - derivative couplings only ( that is we set @xmath57 and we leave @xmath24 and @xmath25 free ) and we show that a bad description of data for the @xmath16 meson is obtained . in the @xmath17 case ( @xmath58 and @xmath41 and @xmath43 free ) , while a fit without derivatives is still acceptable , the resulting parameters are not compatible with the experimental results of ref .",
    "thus , the need of including derivative - like couplings is favoured by our study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we extend the formalism of @xcite to the derivative interaction and we derive the theoretical expressions for the lines shapes of @xmath0-decays . in the third section we present the fits to the experimental results and we study the correlation of the parameters . in the fourth section",
