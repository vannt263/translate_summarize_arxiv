    "the properties of outflows driven by sn explosions and stellar winds are fundamental to the understanding of feedback processes of galaxies . in previous studies , the energy and metals of outflows",
    "are generally inferred from fitting observed spectra with thermal models .",
    "the x - ray line emission , however , can arise not only from hot plasma , but also from its interaction with neutral cool gas .",
    "for example , highly ionised ions in the solar wind can readily pick up electrons from neutral species of a comet .",
    "these electrons , captured in excited states of the ions , will cascade down , leading to x - ray line emission .",
    "this process is called charge exchange x - ray emission ( cxe , also called charge transfer ) and explains the bright cometary x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the process can be represented by : @xmath1 where a highly ionised ion @xmath2 ( like ) picks up an electron from a neutral species",
    "@xmath3 ( like h ) and produces an excited ion @xmath4 . for historical studies and recent developments of the cxe , we refer the readers to @xcite and references therein .",
    "the charge - exchange cross - sections are quite large compared to the cross - sections of electron collisional excitation . for example , at collision velocities of a few hundred km / s , the charge - exchange cross - sections of  and  are @xmath5 @xmath6 , compared to those of electron collisional excitation ( @xmath7@xmath6 ) .",
    "this makes the cxe important even though it takes place in a very thin region compared to the tenuous hot gas .",
    "different from the thermal emission , the cxe contributes only emission lines .",
    "if the x - ray line emission , or part of it , is due to the cxe , the measurement of the thermal and chemical properties of the hot outflow based on thermal - only models will be misleading .",
    "to correctly understand the hot outflow , it is crucial to determine the origin of the x - ray line emission and to separate the contributions from the cxe and the thermal emission .    with the unprecedented spatial resolution of , the extra - planar diffuse x - ray emission of a number of edge - on disk galaxies has been found to be correlated with h@xmath0 emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in less - inclined galaxies , x - ray emission is also found to be correlated morphologically with h@xmath0 emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite speculated on the importance of the cxe between the hot outflow and cool halo gas for starburst galaxies . in the scenario of the cxe , h@xmath0 emission represents entrained cool gas clouds / filaments , while the x - ray emission arises from their interfaces with the surrounding hot plasma .",
    "the spatial correlation between the h@xmath0 and x - ray emissions is thus naturally explained .",
    "a marginal detection of an emission line at 0.459 kev is reported for the x - ray cap above the disk of the starburst galaxy of m82 , which may be due to the cxe of  ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "the direct evidence for the cxe occurring in m82 is from the line ratios of the  k@xmath0 triplet @xcite .",
    "the k@xmath0 triplet of he - like ions is a powerful diagnostic that can be used to reveal the origin of the x - ray line emission ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "it consists of a resonance line , two inter - combination lines , and a forbidden line . for a thermal plasma in ionization equilibrium ,",
    "the electron collisional excitation is efficient and favours the resonance line , while for the cxe , the electron downward cascade favours the triplet states and thus the forbidden line .",
    "therefore , the line ratios of the triplet can be used to determine the origin of the x - ray line emission .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we analysed the k@xmath0 triplets of he - like ions of , , and  of m82 observed by the  reflection grating spectrometers ( rgss ) .",
    "the  triplet is found to be dominated by the forbidden line , and the intensity ratio of the  triplet is consistent with an origin of the cxe .",
    "the flux contributions of the cxe are 90% , 50% , and 30% to the , , and  triplets , respectively .",
    "the  triplet was also used to show the possible presence of charge exchanges between the hot gas and the cool gas spiral in the inner bulge of m31 @xcite .    in this paper , we study the  triplet for a sample of additional eight star - forming galaxies , in comparison with m82 . in all these galaxies ,",
    "the forbidden lines are comparable to or stronger than the resonance lines , which is in contrast to the thermal prediction .",
    "we discuss the other possible mechanisms that can produce a relatively strong forbidden line , such as a collisional non - equilibrium - ionization recombining / ionizing plasma and resonance scattering , which are found to be not favoured for our sample galaxies .",

    "the errors are estimated using the bootstrap method .",
    "the wavelength dispersions are largely determined by the spatial extent , while the wavelength shifts are mainly determined by the spatial offset between the peak x - ray line emission region and the adopted nominal center .",
    "as the  rgs is slit - less , we can not remove point sources from the rgs spectra .",
    "therefore , the continua of the rgs spectra are dominated by point sources and instrument background . as a result",
    ", we choose to fit the triplets with a local continuum within a fitting region extending beyond the triplets .",
    "the fitted continua are generally close to the fluxes at the wings of the  triplets .",
    "the fitting results are plotted in fig . 3 and listed in table 2 .",
    "the often - used line ratio @xmath24 which is a diagnostic of temperature of thermal plasmas , is calculated and listed in table 2 . because the inter - combination lines are poorly constrained due to blending",

    "3 shows a feature around 21.4  , which can not be fitted with the model of three gaussians . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , for m82 , the rgs cross - dispersion direction is not parallel to the outflow direction , and the  triplet will have a different wavelength shift for different cross - dispersion position .",
    "therefore , in the top panel of fig .",
    "4 , we plot the cross - dispersion distributions of m82 for photons between 21.25 and 21.55   and between 22.1 and 22.4  . the photons between 22.1 and 22.4 ",
    "are peaked around the center , while the photons between 21.25 and 21.55   have a plateau from -30@xmath30 to 90@xmath30 .",
    "thus , we divide the cross - dispersion direction into three regions : b ( -90@xmath30  -30@xmath30 ) , a ( -30@xmath30  30@xmath30 ) , and c ( 30@xmath30  90@xmath30 ) , which are denoted in fig .",
    "the  triplets of the three regions are plotted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "the  triplets of the three regions , however , are not simply shifted according to the spatial offsets , but have different line intensity ratios .",
    "the peak around 21.5   of the c region can not be identified as the forbidden line of the  triplets , otherwise , it will have a shift of 0.6  , which is larger than the shift provided by the spatial offset .",
    "instead , it is identified as the resonance line , as evidenced by the relative shift from the  line at 18.8  . for the b region , the forbidden line is dominant ; for the c region , however , the resonance line is dominant .",
    "the three lines peak at 21.4 , 21.9 , and 22.2   of the a region can not be fitted with a single triplet lines , but are a mixture of features of b and c regions . as a result , we have neglected the two data points between 21.3 and 21.5   when fitting the triplet of m82 a. the different ratios of the  triplets of different regions indicate complicated processes and multiple origins of the x - ray emission of m82 .",
    "while the origin of  triplets can be tested through their line ratios , we can not directly tell the origin of other lines such as the  @xmath31line .",
    "however , we can still get some hints by comparing the spatial distribution of such lines with that of the  triplet in the cross - dispersion direction .    in fig . 5 , we plot the cross - dispersion distributions of the  triplet ( 21.422.4  ) , the  @xmath31line ( 18.519.5  ) , and the emission between 14 and 18   for six relatively bright galaxies",
    "we see that the profiles of the  @xmath31line are similar to those of the  triplet , except for m94 , the  @xmath31line of which is more centered .",
    "the similarity between the distributions of the  @xmath31line and the  triplet indicates that they may have a similar origin .",
    "the distributions of the emission between 14 and 18   of the bright galaxies ( m82 , ngc 253 , m51 , and m94 ) are more centered compared to the corresponding profiles of the  triplet .",
    "it may be due to the concentration of the point sources of power - law continuum , as suggested by the increasing continua at 14  18   in the spectra of fig .",
    "2 . nevertheless , for ngc 253 and m51 , the profiles of the emission between 14 and 18   and the  triplet appear to be similar outside the center .",
    "if most of the  @xmath31line emission is indeed primarily from the cxe , it is then interesting to calculate the observed flux ratios of the  @xmath31line to the  triplet ( @xmath32 ) , which are listed in table 2 .",
    "the charge exchange cross sections are similar for  and ions , and the efficiencies of producing a @xmath33 photon are also similar for the resulting excited  and  ions @xcite .",
    "if only a single charge exchange collision occurs ( collisionally thin case ) , the flux ratio @xmath32 reflects the composition ratio of /  of the interacting hot gas . the observed flux ratios of @xmath32 are @xmath34 , which means the ratios of /  are also @xmath34 for the interacting hot gas .",
    "these ratios correspond to a temperature of @xmath35 k in a thermal equilibrium plasma .",
    "we have analysed the  triplets of a sample of nine nearby star - forming galaxies .",
    "all the observed @xmath26 ratios ( eq.3 ) of the galaxies are larger than 1.2 , which is the upper limit for a thermal plasma with temperatures higher than 0.1 kev . for ngc 253 , m51 , m83 , m61 , ngc 4631 , and the antennae , the observed @xmath26 ratios are consistent with the laboratory measured ratio of the cxe , while for m94 and ngc 2903 , the observed @xmath26 ratios indicate multiple origins . for m82 ,",
    "the  triplets of different regions show different line ratios .",
    "the cross - dispersion profiles of the  @xmath31line are similar to those of the  triplet , indicating that the  @xmath31lines may have a similar origin .",
    "below we discuss the cxe and other possible mechanisms for the  triplet emission of a high @xmath26 ratio .      in our sample , three galaxies ( m51 , m61 , and m94 )",
    "show low level agn activities , which can complicate the interpretation of the  triplets .",
    "a high @xmath26 ratio is also expected from the recombining ions due to the photoionization by an agn . however , at least for m61 and m94 , the analysis of the  images indicates that the agn is weak and unlikely to be important .",
    "the  image of the nucleus of m61 reveals that the soft x - ray emission traces an ultraviolet star - forming spiral down to an unresolved core ( 1.5@xmath30 ) , and the soft x - ray emission of the core accounts for only 15% of the total soft x - ray emission in the central 8@xmath30 region @xcite . for m94",
    ", the x - ray emission is resolved into a diffuse component and a cluster of stellar x - ray sources , which appear to follow a recent episode of starburst , and shows no evidence of an agn @xcite .      a collisionl non - equilibrium - ionization ( nei ) recombining / ionizing plasma can also produce a relatively strong forbidden line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in a nei recombining plasma , the recombination lags the cooling ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and the delayed recombination can produce a strong forbidden line . for the star - forming galaxies studied here , however ,",
    "the x - ray emission is spatially correlated with the filamentary h@xmath0 emission .",
    "this fact is consistent with the scenario that x - ray emission arises from the interfaces between the hot outflow and the entrained cold gas , but would be difficult to explain for the nei model in which the emission should come from the bulk of the outflow , where the low density regions will be the most over - ionized .    furthermore , most of the  triplet emission arises from the central region of the galaxies . according to @xcite , @xmath36 in an adiabatic free - flow .",
    "the initial temperature is generally estimated to be around @xmath37 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if we adopt a star - forming region of 100 pc ( as in the case of m82 ) , when it extends to 0.5 kpc , the temperature decreases a factor of 10 , still far above the fully stripping temperature of  ion ( @xmath38 k ) .",
    "a mass - loading factor of 10 will help the plasma to cool to about @xmath39 k , the peak  ion temperature .",
    "but the mass - loading leads to a high density , hence an equilibrium condition .",
    "thus , especially in the central regions where most of the  triplet emission arises from , a nei recombining plasma seems unlikely to be important .",
    "it is also possible to produce a high @xmath26 ratio in an ionizing nei plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as supernovae remnants ( snr ) , in which the heating generally precedes the ionization .",
    "the inner - shell collisional ionization of  ions can lead to excited  ions and to the enhanced forbidden line emission .",
    "however , this happens only in a short transition region when the  fraction is large .",
    "in fact , the observed  triplets of snr generally show a thermal - like ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . for the observed ( accumulated plasma ) spectra of the sample galaxies , the  @xmath31emission is stronger than the  triplet , which means that the  ion fraction is negligible .",
    "another process that may have effect on the line ratios is resonance scattering .",
    "the resonance line has a larger optical depth due to its large oscillator strength compared to the forbidden line .",
    "if the optical depth is large enough , the resonance line intensity can then be re - distributed from the central optical thick region to the outer optical thin region @xcite , and the ratio @xmath26 is increased in the central region and reduced outside . for the off - disk  triplets of m82 b and ngc 253 b , the @xmath26 ratios are higher than the ratio of thermal models , which can not be due to resonance scattering .",
    "furthermore if resonance scattering is important for the   resonance line , so is for the  @xmath31line . for thermal models ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath32 of @xmath40 corresponds to an ion ratio of /@xmath41 , which means the scattering optical depth of the  @xmath31line is @xmath42 times larger than that of the  resonance line .",
    "thus , if resonance scattering is important , the profiles of the  @xmath31line should be flatter than those of the  triplet , which is not observed in fig .",
    "5 .      for the cxe , we can estimate the required property of the hot gas assuming that all the oxygen ions are in  state and can participate in the exchange .",
    "then , the  triplet flux is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the emission radius and assumed to be 0.5 kpc , @xmath45 the velocity ( 1000 km s@xmath46 ) , @xmath47 the distance ( 4 mpc for m82 ) , and @xmath48 the  ion density .",
    "taking the solar oxygen abundance ( @xmath49 ) , we find that an electron density of @xmath50 @xmath51 is enough to produce the observed central  triplet flux of m82 ( @xmath52 photons @xmath53s@xmath46 )",
    ". the effective interacting surface area can , in principle , be substantially greater than @xmath54 , depending on the topology of the cool gas and the dynamics of the turbulent mixing of the hot and cool gases .",
    "the lack of spatial information limits further estimates , but the details of the cxe process can be better constrained with future spatially - resolved high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "since the majority of the  triplets are consistent with the cxe and the emission between 14 and 20   is likely to have a similar origin , one can not measure the temperature and metal abundances of the hot gas assuming thermal models alone .",
    "instead , one needs to incorporate the cxe in the spectral modelling .",
    "the relative abundances of different ions can be obtained by comparing the observed spectra with the cxe models , as has been done for the solar wind based on x - ray spectra of comets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for m82 , the relative abundances of o , ne , and mg were found to be similar to the solar values based on the cxe fluxes of their k@xmath0 triplets @xcite . in some galaxies , one may need to consider the cxe and the thermal emission simultaneously , as shown by the @xmath26 ratios of m94 and ngc 2903 and the  triplets of m82 .",
    "for such a task , a detailed modelling of the cxe is needed .",
    "the cxe cross sections of heavy elements of ne , mg , and fe need to be calculated and/or experimentally measured .",
