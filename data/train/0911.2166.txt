    "it is widely believed that the heavy quarkonium production and annihilation decay can be described by an effective theory , non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd)@xcite . in the nrqcd factorization approach , the production of a heavy quarkonium is described by a series of heavy quark pair states , which are produced at short - distances , and then evolve into the heavy quarkonium at long - distances by emitting or absorbing soft gluons .",
    "the long - distance nrqcd matrix elements are scaled by the relative velocity @xmath6 between quark and antiquark in the quarkonium rest frame . and",
    "the heavy quark pair states at short - distances should not only have the same quantum numbers as those of the quarkonium , but also have other different quantum numbers .",
    "in particular , such heavy quark pairs can be in a color - octet state .",
    "this is the so called color - octet mechanism .",
    "the color - octet scenario seems to acquire some significant successes in describing heavy quarkonium decay and production .",
    "but recently , several next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections for the inclusive and exclusive heavy quarkonium production in the color - singlet piece are found to be large and significantly relieve the conflicts between the color - singlet model predictions and experiments .",
    "it may imply , though inconclusively , that the color - octet contributions in the production processes are not as big as previously expected , and the color - octet mechanism should be studied more carefully .",
    "lots of work have been done to investigate the color - octet mechanism in nrqcd for heavy quarkonium production .",
    "the current experimental results on @xmath0 photoproduction cross sections at hera seem to prefer the nlo color - octet predication @xcite , rather than the description of the nlo color - singlet piece  @xcite .",
    "the delphi data favor the nrqcd color - octet mechanism for @xmath0 production in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath0 and @xmath8 production at the tevatron and lhc were calculated including the color - singlet piece  @xcite and color octet piece  @xcite .",
    "the nlo color - singlet contributions are found to significantly enhance the cross sections especially in the large @xmath9 region .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections to polarizations of @xmath0 and @xmath8 at the tevatron and lhc were also calculated  @xcite .",
    "the qed contributions to the production of @xmath0 there and nlo qcd corrections were also calculated  @xcite .",
    "the nlo relativistic corrections to @xmath0 production at the tevatron and lhc were considered too  @xcite .",
    "the experimental data of polarizations favor the nlo qcd corrections of the color singlet piece rather than the color octet piece .",
    "recent developments and related topics in quarkonium production can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the charmonium production in @xmath10 annihilation at b factories has also provided an important test ground for nrqcd and color - octet mechanism .",
    "the large discrepancies of @xmath0 production via double @xmath11 ( including a hidden or an open charm pair ) in @xmath10 annihilation at b factories between lo theoretical predictions@xcite,@xcite and experimental results  @xcite once were challenging issues but now are largely resolved by higher order corrections : nlo qcd@xcite and relativistic @xcite corrections , and the results show that the color - singlet nlo corrections ( both in @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) may increase the cross section of double charmonium production e.g. @xmath12 by an order of magnitude , and indicate that the color - singlet contributions are overwhelmingly dominant in most cases and there seems no much room for the color - octet contributions in charmonium production in @xmath10 annihilation at b factories ( discussions on the light - cone and other approaches can be seen in @xcite ) .    in the @xmath0 inclusive production @xmath13 at b factories ,",
    "there are two color - octet processes .",
    "one is @xmath14 studied in ref.@xcite , where the light quark @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) emits a hard gluon which turns into a color - octet @xmath17 @xmath11 pair fragmenting into a @xmath0 with soft hadrons .",
    "but the short - distance coefficient of this color - octet process was found to be negligible at @xmath18  gev and can only be important at much higher energies than @xmath18  gev@xcite .",
    "therefore , this process can be ignored at b factories .",
    "the other color - octet process @xmath19 was studied by braaten and chen@xcite .",
    "based on the lo nrqcd calculation , they predicted that the @xmath0 production is dominated by the region near the upper endpoint in the @xmath0 energy distribution , and the width of the peak near the endpoint is of the order of 150 mev .",
    "but the measured @xmath0 spectra in @xmath10 annihilation by babar @xcite and belle@xcite do not exhibit any enhancement near the endpoint .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the total prompt @xmath0 cross sections in @xmath10 annihilation were measured to be @xmath20  pb by babar @xcite , whereas belle gave a much smaller value @xmath21  pb @xcite . obviously , the large discrepancy between the two measurements should be further clarified . on the theoretical side , for the @xmath0 inclusive production cross section",
    ", the color - singlet contributions including @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 at lo in @xmath5 were estimated to be only about @xmath25  pb @xcite , which might imply that the color - octet contribution should play an important role in the inclusive @xmath0 production@xcite .",
    "however , the ratio of @xmath0 production rate through double @xmath11 to that of @xmath0 inclusive production measured by belle@xcite @xmath26 } { \\sigma[e^+e^- \\to j/\\psi + x ] } & = & 0.59 ^{+0.15}_{-0.13}\\pm 0.12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are much larger than lo nrqcd predictions . if only including the color - singlet contribution at lo in @xmath5 , the ratio is about @xmath27@xcite . and a large color - octet contribution to the @xmath0 inclusive production would enhance the denominator and then further decrease this ratio .",
    "so , this became a very puzzling issue .",
    "some theoretical studies have been suggested in resolving this problem .",
    "fleming , leibovich and mehen use the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) to resum the color - octet contribution@xcite .",
    "lin and zhu use scet to analyze the color - singlet contribution to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "leibovich and liu sum the leading and next - to - leading logarithms in the color - singlet contribution to the @xmath0 production cross section@xcite . as a new step ,",
    "zhang and chao find the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath29@xcite to be large , and increase the cross sections by a factor of about 2 ( using the same matrix elements as lo ) , making the ratio @xmath30 larger than the lo results .",
    "very recently , belle reported new measurements@xcite @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 the @xmath0 inclusive production cross section given in eq.([x ] ) is significantly smaller than that given previously by babar@xcite and belle@xcite . the double charm production cross section given in eq.([ccbar ] ) also becomes smaller accordingly .",
    "the cross section of @xmath34 includes the color - singlet contribution of @xmath35 and the color - octet one of @xmath36 .",
    "the color - singlet piece has been investigated by including the nlo @xmath37 correction@xcite and @xmath38 relativistic correction@xcite , of which each contributes an enhancement factor of @xmath39 to the cross section of @xmath40 . as a result",
    ", the color - singlet contribution has saturated the observed value given in eq.([eq : nonccbar ] ) , leaving little room for the color - octet contribution .    in order to further clarify this problem ,",
    "it is certainly useful to study the color - octet process @xmath19 itself and to examine the color - octet effect of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd correction on the @xmath0 production at b factories . in this paper",

    "<S> moreover , the peak at the endpoint in the @xmath0 energy distribution predicted at lo can be smeared by the nlo corrections , but the major color - octet contribution still comes from the large energy region of @xmath0 . by fitting the latest data of @xmath2 observed by belle , we find that the values of color - octet matrix elements are much smaller than expected earlier by using the naive velocity scaling rules or extracted from fitting experimental data with lo calculations . as the most stringent constraint by setting the color - singlet contribution to be zero in @xmath3 , we get an upper limit of the color - octet matrix element , @xmath4|0\\rangle + 4.0\\,\\langle0| { \\cal o}^{j/\\psi } [ { } ^3p_0^{(8)}]|0\\rangle / m_c^2 </S>",
