    "<S> we develop a green light source with low spatial coherence via intracavity frequency doubling of a solid - state degenerate laser . </S>",
    "<S> the second harmonic emission supports many more transverse modes than the fundamental emission , and exhibit lower spatial coherence . </S>",
    "<S> a strong suppression of speckle formation is demonstrated for both fundamental and second harmonic beams . using the green emission for fluorescence excitation </S>",
    "<S> , we show the coherent artifacts are removed from the full - field fluorescence images . </S>",
    "<S> the high power , low spatial coherence and good directionality makes the green degenerate laser an attractive illumination source for parallel imaging and projection display .    </S>",
    "<S> visible lasers have found a wide range of applications in imaging , spectroscopy and display . </S>",
    "<S> their brightness , power efficiency and emission directionality make them more suitable than light emitting diodes ( leds ) for micro - projector applications in mobile devices . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the high coherence of a conventional laser produces speckle noise due to interference of the scattered light from a projection screen . for fluorescence microscopy , </S>",
    "<S> visible lasers are often used as excitation sources , because the common fluorescent dyes have absorption bands in the visible spectrum . even though the fluorescence is spatially incoherent and does not produce speckle , coherent artifacts produced by the pump laser result in spatially non - uniform illumination which then corrupts the fluorescence image . </S>",
    "<S> coherent artifacts can be introduced by aberration of the imaging optics , and interface reflection or edge diffraction . to remove the coherent artifacts , various compounding techniques </S>",
    "<S> have been developed , e.g. , using diffractive elements @xcite , or rotating / vibrating components @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since these methods involve mechanically moving parts , they are relatively slow and require long acquisition times , which limit the application for high - speed imaging or projection .    a different approach to prevent speckle formation is developing lasers with low spatial coherence . </S>",
    "<S> a careful design of the laser cavity can facilitate lasing in many spatial modes with distinct emission pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the total emission from those mutually incoherent lasing modes has low spatial coherence , thus enabling speckle - free full - field imaging . </S>",
    "<S> to date , several types of such lasers have been developed , including dye - based random lasers @xcite , powder - based random raman lasers @xcite , solid - state degenerate lasers @xcite , semiconductor - based chaotic microcavity lasers @xcite , broad - area vertical cavity surface emitting lasers ( vcsels ) @xcite , vcsel arrays @xcite , and degenerate vertical external cavity surface emitting lasers ( vecsels ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of these lasers except the dye - based random lasers @xcite and the powder - based random raman lasers@xcite have emission beyond the visible spectrum , making them unsuitable for imaging or display applications that require visible light . the dye - based random lasers and the powder - based random raman lasers , </S>",
    "<S> though emitting in the visible spectrum , have high lasing threshold and poor collection efficiency . an alternative way of making visible sources , especially of green color , is frequency doubling of infrared ( ir ) lasers . </S>",
    "<S> multi - wavelength , broadband green light sources have been developed for speckle noise reduction by spectral compounding @xcite , but there is a trade - off between the spectral bandwidth and the conversion efficiency , limiting the overall conversion efficiency .    here , </S>",
    "<S> we propose frequency - doubling of a highly multimode ir laser to generate green emission with low spatial coherence . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is challenging to achieve an efficient conversion . </S>",
    "<S> compared to a single - mode ir laser , the multimode laser emission has power distributed over many spatial modes , thus the power per mode is relatively low . because of low spatial coherence , the laser beam can not be focused tightly into a nonlinear crystal . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the second harmonic generation ( shg ) outside the laser cavity is expected to be inefficient , especially for the continuous - wave ( cw ) laser .    to overcome these issues , we place a nonlinear crystal inside a degenerate laser cavity for frequency doubling . </S>",
    "<S> the high power density inside the laser cavity greatly enhances the shg efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> previously , frequency doubling within a degenerate cavity was used to enhance the efficiency of second harmonic generation of weak images @xcite . in this paper , we experiment with a cw solid - state disk laser that support more than 1000 transverse modes lasing simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> since lasing in different modes is not phase - locked , each mode is expected to produce its own second harmonic , thus the number of transverse modes in the second harmonic emission ( at 532 nm ) should be limited by the number of modes in the fundamental emission ( at 1064 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally we find the second harmonic beam has many more transverse modes ( @xmath0 3300 ) than the fundamental beam ( @xmath0 1500 ) . after transmitting through a static diffuser , </S>",
    "<S> the speckle contrast for the green light is notably lower than that of the ir . </S>",
    "<S> a physical explanation is provided for this surprising result . </S>",
    "<S> as an initial demonstration , we use the degenerate green laser as excitation source for fluorescence imaging . </S>",
    "<S> the low spatial coherence results in a significant improvement of the image quality as compared to that taken with a single - mode green laser .     </S>",
    "<S> thin disk as the gain medium , two identical bi - convex lenses arranged in 4-f configuration , a ktp crystal for second harmonic generation , and an output coupler . </S>",
    "<S> the pump beam from a fiber coupled diode laser is focused to the nd : yvo@xmath1 crystal by a lens . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) output power of fundamental emission at 1064 nm ( red dashed line ) and of the second harmonic emission at 532 nm ( green solid line ) vs. the absorbed pump power . </S>",
    "<S> the lasing threshold is 1.5 w. above the threshold , the fundamental emission increases linearly with the pump and the second harmonic grows quadratically . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1](a ) is a schematic of our nd - vanadate degenerate laser with intracavity frequency doubling . </S>",
    "<S> the gain medium is a thin disk of @xmath2 nd : yvo@xmath1 crystal ( 0.6 mm thick and 20 mm in diameter ) . </S>",
    "<S> one surface of the disk has high reflectivity ( hr ) coating to serve as an end mirror of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the other end mirror acts as an output coupler . in between them , </S>",
    "<S> two identical fused - silica plano - convex lenses with focal length @xmath3 = 100 mm are arranged in a 4@xmath3 telescope configuration . </S>",
    "<S> each point on the disk surface will be imaged to the output coupler . in this self - imaging cavity </S>",
    "<S> , any transverse field distribution will be imaged onto itself after a single round trip . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , the eigenmodes of the cavity can have arbitrary transverse field distribution and degenerate frequency . </S>",
    "<S> since all the modes have the same quality factors , lasing can occur simultaneously in many transverse modes without phase correlation between them .    </S>",
    "<S> a fiber coupled diode laser at 808 nm ( coherent , fap800 - 40w ) is used to pump the nd - vanadate crystal to the highly absorbing @xmath4 level . </S>",
    "<S> the pump beam is focused by a lens of @xmath3 = 30 mm to a circular spot of diameter @xmath5 mm on the front surface of the nd - vanadate disk . </S>",
    "<S> the back surface of the disk has hr coating not only at the emission wavelength ( 1064 nm ) but also at the pumping wavelength ( 808 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the incident pump beam is reflected from the back side and passes the disk twice , resulting in @xmath6 absorption of the incident pump light .    </S>",
    "<S> the nd - vanadate disk is in contact with a heat sink through its hr coated surface . </S>",
    "<S> the heat sink is cooled with water at @xmath7 c. the thin disk geometry of the laser crystal greatly reduces the thermal lensing , because the heat flow direction is parallel to the laser cavity axis . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature in the radial direction of the disk is nearly uniform within the pump volume , only in the axial direction is a temperature gradient present @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the efficient cooling enables high - power cw lasing . using an output coupler of @xmath8 reflectivity at 1064 nm , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an output power of 7 w at 1064 nm when the ( absorbed ) pump power is 21 w.    for intracavity frequency doubling , we choose the ktp crystal ( ktipo@xmath1 ) , which has a large angular bandwidth for type ii phase matching @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the ktp crystal has high thermal conductivity and low thermally induced aberration loss @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal is placed in close proximity to the output coupler . to enhance the intracavity power density at the fundamental frequency , we switch to an output coupler with @xmath9 reflectivity at 1064 nm . for an efficient coupling of the second harmonic light out of the cavity , </S>",
    "<S> the output coupler has high transmissivity @xmath10 at 532 nm .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1](b ) plots the output powers at fundamental and second harmonic frequencies as a function of the ( absorbed ) pump power . </S>",
    "<S> the ktp crystal used for this experiment is 5 mm thick and has a lateral dimension of @xmath11 mm . </S>",
    "<S> both sides of the crystal have anti - reflection ( ar ) coating at 1064 nm and 532 nm . to mitigate heating effect in the laser cavity , </S>",
    "<S> the cw pump beam is chopped to @xmath12 duty cycle with 60 hz repetition rate . above the lasing threshold of 1.5 w </S>",
    "<S> , the output power at the fundamental frequency grows linearly with the pump power , while the second harmonic displays a quadratic increase . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates the linear loss of the degenerate laser cavity is dominant over the nonlinear loss due to shg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second harmonic emission is linearly polarized with an extinction ratio of 50:1 .        to determine the number of lasing modes , we measure the output beam quality at 1064 nm and 532 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the beam quality factor @xmath13 is given by the product of the near - field beam width and the far - field divergence , normalized to that of a single ( transverse ) mode beam @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we image the laser emission profile at the output coupler to compute the near - field beam width . to measure the beam divergence </S>",
    "<S> , we put a lens at one focal length away from the output coupler , and record the far - field pattern ( angular spectrum ) at the back focal plane . </S>",
    "<S> the angular spectrum for the fundamental beam has maximum intensity at the center and a slowly decaying tail , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) , and the divergence angle is about 1@xmath14 . the angular spectrum for the second harmonic beam , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) , has a more pronounced peak at the center compared to the fundamental . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be understood from the relation between the far field of second harmonic @xmath15 and that of fundamental @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the convolution relationship creates a sharper peak in the far field of the second harmonic . by inserting a pinhole ( of diameter 100 @xmath18 m ) to the degenerate cavity and placing it at the focal plane in between the two lenses , we increase the loss for high - order transverse modes and achieve lasing only in the fundamental mode @xcite . to compute its space - beamwidth product , both near - field and far - field patterns of the single - mode laser </S>",
    "<S> are measured . by normalizing the space - beamwidth product of the multimode laser ( without a pinhole in the cavity ) to that of the single - mode laser , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the beam quality factor , which gives the number of transverse modes at 1064 nm @xmath19 and 532 nm @xmath20 . at the pump power of 21 w , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a large number of transverse modes in the laser emission reduces the spatial coherence , and prevent the speckle formation . to confirm the speckle suppression , we direct the laser beam to a polarization maintaining ground - glass diffuser and record the speckle patterns of the transmitted light at 1064 nm and 532 nm separately , as shown in fig . [ fig2](c , d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the speckle contrast is calculated , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the standard deviation and @xmath25 is the mean of all pixel intensities in the image . </S>",
    "<S> the speckle pattern at 1064 nm has low contrast @xmath26 = 0.025 , but that at 532 nm has even lower contrast @xmath26 = 0.017 . from the speckle contrast @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the number of spatial modes @xmath27 to be 1600 in the fundamental beam and 3460 modes in the second harmonic beam . </S>",
    "<S> these values are close to those obtained from the beam quality factor measurement described above . </S>",
    "<S> the minor discrepancy is attributed to the error in the measurement of low speckle contrast due to the measurement noise , e.g. , the camera noise .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the finite polarization extinction ratio of 50:1 also reduces the speckle contrast slightly and gives higher estimation for the number of transverse modes than for perfectly polarized light .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) and ( c ) are taken of the same sample location , ( b ) and ( d ) of another location . </S>",
    "<S> the parallel fringes in ( a ) ( marked by arrow ) and rings in ( b ) result from the spatial modulations of pump intensity , which are removed in ( c , d ) when the spatial coherence of the pump laser is greatly reduced . ]    since individual transverse modes in the degenerate cavity lase independently , they produce their own second harmonic . </S>",
    "<S> shg is a coherent process , and second harmonic photons should not be generated from fundamental photons in mutually incoherent modes . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , one would expect the number of second harmonic modes is equal to or lower than that of the fundamental , but both beam quality factor and speckle contrast measurements show that the second harmonic has many more modes than the fundamental . in the degenerate cavity , </S>",
    "<S> the number of transverse modes at the second harmonic frequency is four times of that at the fundamental frequency , because the mode area of the second harmonic is four times smaller . </S>",
    "<S> the laser emission has a finite coherence time , which exceeds the round - trip time of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> different transverse modes are coherent within the coherence time , which is much longer than the passage time through the nonlinear crystal . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the fundamental fields in different transverse modes are phase coherent while propagating through the ktp crystal , and they can generate the second harmonic fields . due to large acceptance angle of the ktp crystal , two fundamental modes with slightly different transverse spatial frequencies @xmath28 still satisfy the phase matching condition for shg , and they generate the second harmonic field with the transverse spatial frequency of @xmath29 , in addition to their own second harmonic fields of @xmath30 and @xmath31 . thus the second harmonic contains more transverse modes than the fundamental , but the ratio of their mode number is less than four because the higher - order transverse modes have lower nonlinear conversion efficiency than the lower order ones due to the angular dependent phase matching condition .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the green emission from the degenerate laser to remove coherent artifact in fluorescence imaging . for an initial demonstration </S>",
    "<S> , we make a fluorescence screen from 5 mmol rhodamine 640 in diethylene glycol ( deg ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dye solution is injected to a 50-@xmath32-thick chamber sandwiched between a cover slip and a glass slide . </S>",
    "<S> the four sides of the chamber are sealed with vacuum gel to prevent evaporation .    </S>",
    "<S> the second harmonic output of the degenerate laser was focused to a spot of 10 mm on the screen to excite the dye molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the fluorescence image is recorded by a color camera ( moticam 2300 ) . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also use a commercial dpss ( diode - pumped solid - state ) laser with single transverse mode as the excitation source . </S>",
    "<S> figures [ fig3](a ) and ( b ) are fluorescence images taken with the single - mode laser illumination . </S>",
    "<S> interference fringes and rings are clearly seen in the images . </S>",
    "<S> they originate from the spatial variations of the pump intensity . </S>",
    "<S> such variations are caused by interference of multiple reflections from the imaging optics and the sample substrate of the coherent laser beam.these coherent artifacts , however , vanish when the sample is illuminated by the second harmonic emission of the degenerate laser , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c , d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the low spatial coherence eliminates the interference - induced modulation of the excitation intensity .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a green light source with low spatial coherence through intracavity frequency doubling of a thin - disk solid - state degenerate laser . </S>",
    "<S> the second harmonic emission contains @xmath0 3300 transverse modes , and exhibits lower spatial coherence than the fundamental emission . </S>",
    "<S> such low coherence reduces the speckle contrast to below @xmath33 , and removes coherent artifacts in the fluorescence imaging . </S>",
    "<S> the laser output power can be further increased by better matching the nonlinear loss to the linear loss of the degenerate cavity @xcite . in the current system , </S>",
    "<S> half of the second harmonic emission , produced by the fundamental beam that is reflected from the output coupler , is lost . </S>",
    "<S> an hr coating on the distal surface of the nonlinear crystal at the second harmonic frequency will reflect such second harmonic emission to the output coupler and double the output power . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the thermal load can be reduced by shifting the pump wavelength to 880 nm to pump directly to the @xmath34 emitting level . </S>",
    "<S> although absorption of pump in a single pass is reduced , recirculating the pump beam in the laser crystal in a multipass pumping scheme will enhance the absorption efficiency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the high power , low spatial coherence and good directionality will make the green degenerate laser an attractive illumination source for full - field imaging and projection display . </S>"
