    "recent conclusive results from the sudbury neutrino observatory  ( sno ) have established the existence of non - electron active neutrino components in the @xmath1 solar neutrino flux @xcite and hence have given a strong evidence for neutrino oscillation .",
    "these results are based on the three reactions measured by sno to detect the @xmath1 solar flux @xmath2  the charged current reaction ( cc ) is sensitive exclusively to electron - type neutrinos , while the neutral current reaction ( nc ) is equally sensitive to all active neutrino flavors ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the elastic scattering reaction ( es ) is sensitive to all active flavors as well , but with reduced sensitivity to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "detection of these three reactions allows sno to determine the electron and non - electron active neutrino components of the solar flux , and it is then obvious that the cross sections for these three reactions are important inputs for sno .",
    "the cross sections for all three reactions are determined from theory , but the cc and nc cross sections involve nuclear - physics complexities not present in the es interaction description .",
    "thus the cc and nc cross sections have become the main source of theoretical uncertainties for sno .",
    "the complexities in the cc and nc processes are due to two - body currents which are interactions involving two nucleons and external leptonic currents . in the potential model approach ,",
    "the two - body currents are associated with the meson exchange currents and can be calculated in terms of unknown weak couplings . in effective field theory ( eft ) , the two - body currents are parameterized . in both cases ,",
    "experimental data from some other processes are required in order to calibrate the unknowns in the problem . in eft",
    ", this calibration procedure can be described in an economic and systematic way .",
    "the reason is that , up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in eft , all low - energy weak interaction deuteron breakup processes depend on a common isovector axial two - body current , parameterized by @xmath6 @xcite ( see more explanations in the next section ) .",
    "this implies that a measurement of any one of the breakup processes could be used to fix @xmath6 .",
    "a summary of the previous efforts in the determination of @xmath6 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "after briefly reviewing the eft approach , we will present the constraint on @xmath6 using a combined analysis of the cc , nc and es data from sno  and super - kamiokande ( sk ) .",
    "we then compare this new result with other determinations of @xmath6 and comment on the interpretation of sno s measurements with the assumption about the size of @xmath6 eliminated .",
    "for the deuteron breakup processes used to detect solar neutrinos , where the neutrino energies @xmath7  mev , the typical momentum scales in the problem are much smaller than the pion mass @xmath8 mev@xmath9 in these systems pions do not need to be treated as dynamical particles since they only propagate over distances @xmath10 , much shorter than the scale set by the typical momentum of the problem .",
    "thus the pionless nuclear effective field theory , @xmath11 @xcite , is applicable .    in @xmath11 ,",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom are nucleons and non - hadronic external currents .",
    "massive hadronic excitations such as pions and the delta resonance are not dynamical .",
    "their contributions are encoded in the contact interactions between nucleons .",
    "nucleon - nucleon interactions are calculated perturbatively with the small expansion parameter @xmath12 which is the ratio of the light to heavy scales .",
    "the light scales include the inverse s - wave nucleon - nucleon scattering length @xmath13 mev@xmath14 in the @xmath15 channel , the deuteron binding momentum @xmath16 mev ) in the @xmath17 channel , and the typical nucleon momentum @xmath18 in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the heavy scale @xmath19 is set by the pion mass @xmath20 .",
    "this formalism has been applied successfully to many processes involving the deuteron  @xcite , including compton scattering @xcite , @xmath21 for big - bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , @xmath22 reactions for sno physics @xcite , the solar @xmath23 fusion process @xcite , and parity violating observables @xcite .",
    "in addition , this formalism has been applied successfully to three - nucleon systems @xcite .",
    "it has revealed highly non - trivial renormalizations associated with three body forces in the @xmath24 channel ( e.g. , @xmath25he and the triton ) .",
    "for other channels , precision calculations were carried out to higher orders @xcite .    for low energy deuteron breakup processes",
    ", it is well known that the dominant contributions to the hadronic matrix elements are the @xmath26 @xmath15 transitions through the isovector axial couplings .",
    "the @xmath17 state ( such as a deuteron ) has spin @xmath27 and isospin @xmath28 , while the @xmath15 state has @xmath29 and @xmath30 . amongst the spin - isospin operators * 1 * , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , only the isovector axial coupling @xmath34 can connect @xmath17 to @xmath15 states .",
    "the @xmath35 transitions are suppressed at low energies because i ) the isovector operators do not contribute ( the transition is isoscalar ) and ii ) the matrix elements of the one - body isoscalar operators vanish in the zero recoil limit ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 states are orthogonal in this limit ) .",
    "this leads to large suppression of the isoscalar two - body contributions through the interference terms .",
    "also , at low energies , the non - derivative operators are more important than the derivative operators .",
    "thus the leading two - body current contributions for low energy weak interaction deuteron breakup processes only depend on a non - derivative , isovector axial two - body current , @xmath6 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath11 is applied to compute the cross - sections for four channels ( cc , nc , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) to nnlo , up to 20 mev ( anti)neutrino energies . as already mentioned , these processes have been shown to depend on only one parameter , @xmath6 .",
    "this dependence is subject to an intrinsic uncertainty in our eft calculation at nnlo of less than 3% . through varying @xmath6 , the potential model results of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite are reproduced to high accuracy for all four channels .",
    "this confirms that the @xmath40 difference between refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite is due largely to different assumptions made about short distance physics .",
    "the same two - body current @xmath6 also contributes to the proton - proton fusion process @xmath41 .",
    "this is the primary reaction in the @xmath42 chain of nuclear reactions that power the sun , reactions which in turn generate the neutrino flux to be observed by sno .",
    "the calculations in @xmath11 were carried out initially to second order @xcite , and then to fifth order @xcite .",
    "thus a calibration to sno s cc and nc reactions can also be used to calibrate the proton - proton fusion process .",
    "in this section we present the constraint on @xmath43obtained from a combined analysis of the solar neutrino fluxes measured by cc , nc , and es reactions . in sno",
    "s analysis , a specific @xmath43was chosen in cc and nc reactions .",
    "the extracted solar neutrino fluxes from cc and nc were then compared to each other and to es to extract a consistent set of neutrino flavor - conversion probabilities and to map allowed regions in a 2-mass mixing description . here",
    "we take @xmath43as a free parameter and use the available experimental data from sno and sk to fix not only the flavor - conversion probabilities but also @xmath6 .",
    "the only assumption we will make is that the _ total _ flux for the active solar neutrinos has the standard @xmath44b shape .    in the two - flavor oscillation analysis",
    "there are three parameters extracted , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , which are the differences between the squares of the neutrino masses , the mixing angle , and the total active neutrino flux .",
    "there are three separate experimental inputs , the es , cc , and nc rates .",
    "it might at first be thought impossible to extract a fourth parameter , @xmath6 , without additional inputs or assumptions , such as fixing the shape of the electron - neutrino spectrum . the shape is experimentally determined , but not yet with high accuracy .",
    "our strategy is to note that , in active - only oscillations , there is no shape distortion in the total flux , and that the integrated spectral response in the cc reaction over a certain range of final electron energies is the same as that in the es reaction over a different range of energies , independent of distortions of the neutrino spectrum @xcite .",
    "the cc and nc are measured at sno and the es is both measured at sno and sk .",
    "the measured event rates are the integrals of the effective cross sections weighted by the solar neutrino fluxes that reached the target .",
    "@xmath48 \\ ,   \\label{m1c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 is the event rate , @xmath50 is the @xmath51 flux and @xmath52 is the neutrino energy .",
    "@xmath53 is the effective cross section , defined in appendix a , with @xmath54 for @xmath55 es interaction .",
    "these effective cross sections are the true cross sections convoluted with the detector resolution functions which describe how the energy is transferred to electrons and detected by their cherenkov radiations .",
    "the effective cross sections depend on the electron detection threshold @xmath56 . for cc and nc reactions , they also depend on @xmath57 .",
    "the total flux for the active solar neutrinos is assumed to have the standard @xmath44b shape , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the normalized @xmath1 shape function ( @xmath60 ) @xcite and @xmath61 is the magnitude of the @xmath62 flux .",
    "this assumption is valid if there are no oscillations to sterile neutrinos , or , even if such mixing _ is _ present , the survival probability to active neutrinos is energy independent .",
    "similarly , the @xmath63 flux is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the probability distribution of finding a @xmath63 out of a @xmath62 .",
    "obviously , @xmath66 is bounded between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we follow villante et al . in ref.@xcite to define the averaged effective cross sections @xmath69 and the normalized response functions @xmath70 for the @xmath1 spectrum @xmath71 then we rewrite eqs .",

    "\\label{m2c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an important observation made in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the terms with the normalized response function @xmath73 dependence can be related by choosing suitable detection thresholds .",
    "this allows us to reduce the numbers of unknowns such that eqs.([m2a]-[m2c ] ) become solvable .",
    "these approximate relations and their corrections are systematically explored in appendix a. as shown in fig.1(b ) , @xmath74 is very insensitive to @xmath6 .",
    "thus we can set @xmath75 also , as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , to a very good approximation , @xmath76 the corrections of the above relations change @xmath6 by up to a negligible amount of 0.25 fm@xmath25 .",
    "a more significant correction comes from @xmath78 we will use a parameter @xmath79 in eq.([m3c ] ) to parametrize the correction .",
    "because of eq.([s ] ) , the @xmath6 dependence only shows up in @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the scaling can be written as @xmath82 where the @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the values used by sno @xcite which are based on the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite with the electromagnetic radiative corrections of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an earlier attempt ) and a 5 mev electron detection threshold .",
    "these cross sections are corresponding to the nnlo eft results with @xmath85 fm@xmath25 , where the renormalization scale @xmath86 is set to the pion mass . in the following expressions",
    ", we will suppress the @xmath86 dependence of @xmath6 for simplicity .",
    "the scaling functions can be  parametrized as @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "it is interesting to note that if @xmath90 were averaged true cross sections instead of the averaged _ effective _ cross sections , then @xmath91 and @xmath92 would be almost identical @xcite .",
    "the larger difference here is due to the difference in the detection methods . as shown in eqs.([2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) , the cc event detection requires the final state electron energy to be above a certain detection threshold , thus leptons transferring too much energy to the hadrons will not be detected . for nc detection , however , there is no such discrimination  all the neutrons generated in nc have the same probability to be detected in the thermalization and capture process . thus in general , the scaling factor of nc is associated with that of more energetic scattering ( with larger energy transfer to the hadrons ) than that of cc .",
    "we find the qualitative difference between @xmath91 and @xmath92 is consistent with the neutrino energy dependence of the scaling factors calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    substituting eqs.([s]-[n2 ] ) into the eqs .",

    "as shown in appendix a , there is a model independent bound @xmath96 this correction introduces changes @xmath6 by up to @xmath97fm@xmath25 but changes the other quantities by negligible amounts .",
    "now it is clear that eqs.([m3a]-[m3c ] ) are solvable .",
    "the three equations determine three quantities : @xmath47 , @xmath6 and @xmath98 , which are the magnitude of the total active neutrino flux , the axial two - body current , and the measured @xmath99 ratio , respectively . if there is no neutrino oscillation , then @xmath100 .    for the experimental inputs",
    ", sno has measured the es rates , but the sk determination is more precise while in agreement with sno .",
    "therefore we use the sk measurements not only to provide a value for the integral above 6.8 mev as shown above , but also to fix ( and remove ) the es contribution to the total sno rates above 5 mev . with 1496 days of data ,",
    "sk reports @xcite the equivalent electron neutrino fluxes ( @xmath101 ) for analysis thresholds of 6.5 and 5.0 mev , @xmath102 respectively , where the statistical and systematic errors have been added in quadrature . here and in the subsequent analysis in this paper , where asymmetric errors occur",
    ", we simply use the larger .",
    "we take the uncertainties in the two sk fluxes to be fully correlated . in view of the lack of significant threshold - energy dependence in the sk flux , we assume @xmath103    sno provides a model - independent value for the nc rate , obtained by separating the cc and nc parts of the signal by their different radial and sun - angle dependences in the detector .",
    "this result is independent of the energy spectrum of the cc events .",

    "the uncertainties ( except for the backgrounds ) are statistical . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a few comments can be made about the result we obtain in eq.([results ] ) .",
    "first , the only assumption we have made is that the active neutrino flux has the standard @xmath1 shape .",
    "the rest of the treatment is model independent in the sense that we have not assumed the size of @xmath6 or assumed any neutrino oscillation scenarios .",
    "second , our result on @xmath105 can be used to constrain neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "third , the size of the active neutrino flux is consistent with the @xmath63 flux of the standard solar model @xmath106@xmath107s@xmath108 .",
    "this sets a constraint on the oscillations between the active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "fourth , the range of  @xmath6 we have obtained is consistent with the estimated value @xmath109",
    "@xmath110 fm@xmath25 ( at @xmath111 ) from dimensional analysis @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the constraints from reactor - antineutrino deuteron breakup processes @xcite , tritium beta decay @xcite , helioseismology @xcite , and the latest improved potential model results @xcite ( corresponding to @xmath6 @xmath112 fm@xmath25 ) .",
    "the comparison of their corresponding nnlo @xmath6 s is listed in table [ l1a ] .",
    "here we have assumed that most of the higher order effects in eft can be absorbed by @xmath6 , and the higher order theoretical systematics are therefore not included in the assigned error bars .",
    "we expect a @xmath113 to @xmath114 fm@xmath25 contribution to the effective value of @xmath6 from higher orders .",
    "the sign is fixed by an explicit fifth - order calculation of the proton - proton fusion at threshold @xcite which shows that @xmath6 shifts by + 2 to + 3 fm@xmath25 from the third order ( nnlo ) to the fifth order .",
    "even though the tritium beta decay analysis assumes that the three - body current is negligible and the helioseismology analysis does not include the uncertainties from the solar model , it is still very encouraging that all the constraints agree with each other very well , given how different the physical systems are .",
    "it is likely in the future the error bar of @xmath115 could be reduced by a factor of 2 . in that case , the error on @xmath43 would be reduced to 5 fm@xmath25 .",
    "it is also interesting to reinvestigate the null hypothesis ( specifically that all observed fluxes can be described consistently within the standard model of particles and fields ) when @xmath43 is allowed to float .",
    "@xmath116 in the standard model , and thus the set of three equations ( [ m3a]-[m3b ] ) contain only two parameters .",
    "one finds that the set is inconsistent at 4.3 @xmath117 .",
    "alternatively , if one uses the experimental determination of @xmath43from reactor data ( table [ l1a ] ) , the null hypothesis fails at 5.1 @xmath118 ( sno only ) or 5.3 @xmath118 ( sno and sk ) .",
    "thus , even if sno were to place no reliance at all on the theoretical calculations of short - distance physics @xcite , it would still be true that the no - flavor - conversion hypothesis is ruled out with high confidence .",
    "one might suspect that if the value of @xmath6 is taken from some other constraints , perhaps the @xmath1 shape assumption for the active neutrino flux can be removed .",
    "this question can be easily answered by inspecting the new set of equations @xmath119 \\ ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 are the un - oscillated @xmath1 @xmath63 flux and @xmath121 is the probability distribution between the @xmath122 transition . if @xmath123 and @xmath124 satisfy the relation @xmath125 then one can determine @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath120 provided @xmath6 is given . unfortunately , the above relation , which implies @xmath128 ,",

    "we have confirmed that sno s conclusions about the inconsistency of the no - flavor - conversion hypothesis and the magnitude of the active solar neutrino flux do not have significant theoretical model dependence .",
    "our method has shown that sno can be self - calibrated or be calibrated by sk with respect to theoretical uncertainties , and that the resulting calibration produces results in close accord with theoretical expectations .",
    "alternatively , the purely experimental determination of @xmath43from reactor antineutrino data can be used to remove the dependence on theory , and sno s conclusions are unaffected .    1 in    * acknowledgments *    we would like to thank petr vogel for useful discussions .",
