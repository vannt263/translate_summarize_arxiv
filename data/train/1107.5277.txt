    "conservation of charge conjugation and angular momentum including parity constrain the dynamics of the decay products .",
    "the photon and the @xmath1 meson are eigenstates of the charge symmetry transformation with the eigenvalues c = 1 and c = + 1 , respectively .",
    "therefore , due to c invariance the @xmath4 system must have c = 1 . to ensure c invariance",
    ", the orbital angular momentum @xmath6 between the two pions must be odd .",
    "all involved particles have negative parity .",
    "consequently , parity invariance demands that the orbital angular momentum @xmath7 between the photon and the two - pion system must also be odd .",
    "finally , total angular momentum conservation incorporating the fact that the intrinsic spin of the photon is unity leads to the requirement @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the lowest partial waves which contribute are _ p_-waves",
    ". presumably , higher partial waves with @xmath9 are not very important .",
    "radiative decays of the @xmath1 meson are driven by the chiral anomaly of qcd .",
    "the effects of the anomaly have been summarized by wess and zumino in an effective lagrangian  @xcite . as shown by witten ,",
    "this lagrangian is an essential part of effective field theories , because it is necessary in order to correctly incorporate the parity transformation of qcd  @xcite . at the chiral limit of zero momentum and massless",
    "quarks the decay @xmath0 is determined by the box anomaly term of the wess - zumino - witten lagrangian , which describes the direct coupling of three pseudoscalar mesons and a photon .",
    "the dynamic range of the decay is limited by two pion rest masses and the @xmath1 mass , @xmath10 , and is , thus , far from the chiral limit . as a consequence ,",
    "the decay rate calculated from the box anomaly term at the tree level is smaller by a factor of two compared to the measured value .",
    "higher order terms of the chiral lagrangian have to be taken into account to achieve a correct description of the decay @xmath0 .",
    "calculations at the one - loop level show an improved agreement between experiment and theory  @xcite . but there remains , however , a significant difference .",
    "several efforts have been made to include final state interactions by unitarized extensions to the box - anomaly term , e.g. a momentum dependent vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model  @xcite , the hidden local symmetry model  @xcite , an omnes - function which accounts for the _ p_-wave pion scattering phase shift  @xcite , and a chiral unitary approach  @xcite .    to test the validity of the different models , not only the decay rate but also differential distributions of the dalitz plot variables need to be compared with experimental data .",
    "for this purpose it is useful to parameterize the dalitz plot in terms of the photon energy @xmath11 in the rest frame of the @xmath1 meson and the angle  @xmath12 of the @xmath13 relative to the photon in the pion - pion rest frame .",
    "e@xmath14 is related to the squared invariant mass of the pion pair @xmath15 according to @xmath16    the photon energy distribution has been subject of only a few measurements forty years ago  @xcite .",
    "the results of the two statistically most significant publications  @xcite are presented without acceptance corrections . instead",
    ", the models which have been used for the interpretation of the data were folded with the acceptance and the results seem to be inconsistent  @xcite .    due to the limitations of the currently available experimental data the potential of the decay @xmath0 to provide insight to the anomalous sector of qcd can not be fully exploited . in order to perform compelling tests of the box anomaly and its higher order terms in chiral perturbation theory as well as of the non - perturbative extensions of the box - anomaly terms a new measurement with higher precision",

    "the interaction region is surrounded by a central detector covering scattering angles from 20 to 169 degrees .",
    "it consists of a straw tube drift chamber , which is operated in the magnetic field of 0.85  t provided by a superconducting solenoid for the momentum reconstruction of charged particles , an electromagnetic calorimeter to measure energies of charged as well as neutral particles and thin plastic scintillators to discriminate charged and neutral particles already at the trigger level .",

    "[ fig : hemm ] illustrates that the direct reactions contribute to the background for @xmath1 decays only in a range of a few mev / c@xmath22 around the @xmath1 meson mass .",

    "therefore , this background contributes predominantly to the low end of the reconstructed @xmath11 spectrum . in order to increase the signal to background ratio in this region a correlated condition",
