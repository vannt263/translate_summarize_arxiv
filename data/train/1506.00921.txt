    "* ) are two of the nearest star - forming regions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "they have both been instrumental in the emergence of our current understanding of low - mass star - formation @xcite , and have been studied extensively at virtually all wavelengths . for instance , there are extensive surveys of taurus in x - rays by @xcite , optical by briceo et al .",
    "( 1993 ; 1999 ) , near - infrared by @xcite , submillimeter by @xcite , and radio by @xcite .",
    "similarly , in ophiuchus , large - scale observations were obtained in x - rays @xcite , near - infrared @xcite , submillimeter @xcite , and radio @xcite .",
    "more recently , both regions have been targeted by the spitzer space telescope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the herschel space observatory ( http://www.herschel.fr/cea/gouldbelt/en/ ) .",
    "the distance to both regions is known very accurately thanks to recent trigonometric parallax measurements obtained from radio very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations @xcite . in the case of taurus ,",
    "the accuracy of these vlbi measurements is sufficient to characterize the depth of the complex , and crudely reconstruct its 3-dimensional structure @xcite .",
    "the proximity of these two regions enables the detection of intrinsically faint sources ( e.g.  substellar objects ) and ensures high linear spatial resolution .",
    "it also facilitates the accurate determination of proper motions , since for a given space velocity , the amplitude of the angular displacement diminishes linearly with distance .",
    "we will exploit this latter property here to derive the three - dimensional velocity vector for a sample of young stellar objects distributed across each of the regions .",
    "this will be achieved by combining radial velocity measurements from optical and near infrared spectroscopy , with proper motions derived from multi - epoch radio interferometric observations supplemented , of course , by the accurate distances mentioned earlier to perform the conversion from angular to space velocity .",
    "both conventional interferometers such as nrao s very large array ( vla ) and long baseline interferometers ( e.g.  nrao s very long baseline array ; vlba ) can be used to obtain accurate proper motions .",
    "examples of vla measurements are shown in @xcite and @xcite , while examples of vlba results can be found in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we will collect existing radial velocity and radio proper motion measurements available in the literature for young stars in taurus and ophiuchus , and combine them to construct the 3-dimensional velocity vectors for roughly a dozen young stellar systems in taurus and ophiuchus .",
    "these results will be used to analyze the internal and relative kinematics of the taurus and ophiuchus star - forming regions .",
    "two important technical points must be made at the outset .",
    "the first one is that the proper motions measured using radio interferometers are , by construction , measured in a reference frame associated with the solar system barycenter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the second is relative to the conversion of radial velocities from the lsr to heliocentric system .",
    "while the results of optical spectroscopy are usually reported in the heliocentric system , millimeter spectroscopic observations ( that we will use for some of the sources ) are often reported in the lsr system .",
    "for consistency with the proper motion measurements , we will express all radial velocities in the heliocentric system .",
    "the conversion from lsr to heliocentric involves the projection of the sun motion along the line of sight . as we will see below",
    ", there is some on - going discussion about the true value of the solar motion .",
    "however , as far as we know , all observatories use the same ( fairly old ) solar motion determination , corresponding to + 20 km s@xmath0 toward b1900 equatorial coordinates @xmath1 for the conversion from heliocentric to lsr velocities .",
    "this is the value that we will use to perform the conversion when radial velocities in the literature are expressed in the lsr frame .      in the case of the taurus complex ,",
    "accurate proper motion measurements are available for 7 young stellar systems : hubble 4 , hde 283571 , hp tau g2 , v773 tau , t tau , l 1551 irs5 , and dg tau .",
    "we now briefly present and discuss each source invidually , emphasizing the distance , proper motion , and radial velocity measurements .",
    "a summary of these parameters is provided in table 1 .",

    "it is clear that the radial velocities are typically accurate to about 1 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the proper motions , on the other hand , typically have a 1-dimensional uncertainty of 1 mas yr@xmath0 . at the distance of ophiuchus and taurus",
    ", this also corresponds to about 1 km s@xmath0 errors on the tangential velocity .",
    "since our goal here is to analyze the internal and relative motions of taurus and ophiuchus , we first convert the measured proper motions and radial velocities to 3-dimensional velocity vectors .",
    "we will express these vectors in the rectangular @xmath19 coordinate system commonly used for galactic studies .",
    "the origin of the system is at the sun ; the @xmath20 axis runs along the sun  galactic center direction , the positive direction being toward the galactic center ; @xmath21 is in the galactic plane , orthogonal to @xmath20 , with the positive direction in the direction of galactic rotation ; @xmath22 is perpendicular to the galactic plane , oriented toward the galactic north pole , thereby making @xmath23 a right - handed coordinate system . from the data in table 1 ,",
    "both the positions @xmath24 and the heliocentric velocities @xmath25 of each of our stars in the @xmath19 frame can easily be computed .",
    "they are listed in table 2 .",
    "expressing velocities in the heliocentric system is practical from an observational point of view , because the dynamics of the solar system are so well known that heliocentric velocities only contain extremely small systematic uncertainty ( i.e.  the transformation from topocentric to heliocentric velocities is very accurate ) . for the point of view of galactic dynamics , however , a sun - based system is not ideal .",
    "in particular , for objects in the solar neighborhood , the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is preferable .",
    "the transformation from heliocentric to lsr velocities is effected by subtracting the motion of the sun relative to the lsr from the heliocentric velocities .",
    "this is straightforward in principle , but introduces significant errors in practice , because the solar motion relative to the lsr is somewhat uncertain . as we mentioned earlier",
    ", velocities reported in the lsr system normally assume a solar motion of + 20 km s@xmath0 toward b1900 equatorial coordinates @xmath1 .",
    "more recent determinations , however , suggest significantly different values . until recently , the hipparcos - based determination of @xcite was widely used . for this determination , the components of the solar motion in the rectangular @xmath19 coordinate system introduced",
    "earlier are @xmath26 = 10.00 @xmath3 0.36 km s@xmath0 , @xmath27 = 5.25 @xmath3 0.62 km s@xmath0 , and @xmath28 = 7.17 @xmath3 0.38 km s@xmath0 . on the basis of a global analysis of high accuracy trigonometric parallaxes to high - mass star - forming regions distributed across the galactic plane , @xcite argued in favor of a significantly larger value of @xmath27 .",
    "this is supported by a recent re - analysis of stellar kinematics in the solar neighborhood by @xcite who obtained @xmath26 = 11.1 @xmath3 0.7 km s@xmath0 , @xmath27 = 12.2 @xmath3 0.47 km s@xmath0 , and @xmath28 = 7.25 @xmath3 0.37 km s@xmath0 . here",
    ", we will adopt this latter value to transform the @xmath25 heliocentric velocities of the young stars in taurus and ophiuchus into @xmath29 lsr velocities for those stars .",
    "the results are given in table 2 .",
    "let us now analyze the 3d velocity vectors in the taurus complex . in the top row of figure 1 , we show their projections onto the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 planes .",
    "when we consider the heliocentric velocities ( shown as green arrows in the top row of figure 1 ) , the motions appear highly organized as a result of the dominant reflex motion induced by the sun . when the solar motion is removed ( magenta arrows in the top row of figure 1 ) , the motions appear less clearly organized , although there is still a clear remaining bulk motion , particularly in the negative @xmath20 direction .",
    "this bulk motion is shown as a blue arrow in the top row of figure 1 , and will be discussed further below .",
    "the smaller value and more disorganized aspect of the lsr velocities compared with the heliocentric ones evidently reflects the fact that the heliocentric velocities are dominated by ( minus ) the solar motion itself .",
    "while the sun has a 1520 km s@xmath0 non - circular ( i.e.  peculiar ) velocity component in its orbit around the galactic center , the taurus complex is on a much more circular orbit , as expected for a region of star - formation .",
    "to characterize the internal kinematics of the stars in the taurus complex , we now compute the difference @xmath33 between the velocity @xmath29 of each star in taurus and their mean @xmath34 . for reference ,",
    "the latter is @xmath35 = @xmath36 km s@xmath0 , and corresponds to @xmath37 = @xmath38 km s@xmath0 when expressed in heliocentric velocities .",
    "this is very similar to the value obtained independently by @xcite from a larger sample of young stars in taurus with lower accuracy proper motion and distance measurements : @xmath37 = @xmath39 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the projections of @xmath33 are shown in the bottom row of figure 1 .",
    "they have a fairly random appearance , with one - dimensional dispersion @xmath40 = 1.3 km s@xmath0 , @xmath41 = 2.1 km s@xmath0 , @xmath42 = 3.2 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the three - dimensional velocity dispersion is @xmath43 = @xmath44 = 4.1 km s@xmath0 .    to assess quantitatively the relative importance of",
    "random and organized motions within taurus , we proceed as follows .",
    "each star is located at a position relative to the center of the complex given by the vector @xmath45 and moves relative to the complex at a velocity @xmath46 . to each position vector @xmath45 ,",
    "we associate the unit vector @xmath47 = @xmath48 which simply points from the center to each given star in the complex .",
    "we will consider two types of organized motions : expansion ( or contraction ) and rotation .",
    "the velocity @xmath46 of each star in the complex ( measured relative to the complex itself ) should be parallel to @xmath47 for expansion , and anti - parallel for contraction .",
    "thus , the dot product @xmath49 should be large and positive for expansion , and large but negative for contraction . by the same token",
    ", the cross product @xmath50 should be small for expansion and contraction .",
    "conversely , for large - scale rotation , we expect the cross product @xmath50 to be large and the dot product @xmath49 to be small .",
    "for instance , for circular rotation in a disk - like structure , @xmath46 and @xmath47 would be orthogonal , so the dot product would be zero and the cross product would be maximum . for a 3-dimensional structure such as taurus , the situation would be slightly more complex , but one would certainly expect the cross product to be large and the dot product to be small .",
    "an alternative way of looking at this issue is that the quantity @xmath50 is a proxy for the specific angular momentum of the complex , which is expected to be large for rotation , but small for contraction and expansion .",
    "we calculated the cross and dot products described above for each star in taurus , and took their mean .",
    "notice that both quantities have dimensions of velocity ( this was , indeed , the reason for using the unit vector @xmath47 rather than @xmath45 itself , in the dot and cross products ) . because the dot product is a measure of expansion ,",
    "while the cross product is a measure of rotation , we will introduce the following definitions :    @xmath51    @xmath52    of course , these quantities are not strictly expansion and rotation velocities , but in view of our previous discussion , they can be used as proxies for them .    for taurus ,",
    "we obtain @xmath53 = 0.15 km s@xmath0 and @xmath54 = @xmath55 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the individual values of the dot and cross products are shown in table 3 , and the projections of the individual cross product vectors are shown in the bottom row of figure 1 .",
    "the expansion velocity appears very small compared with the velocity dispersion of @xmath16 4 km s@xmath0 measured earlier .",
    "this results from the fact that the individual dot products are alternatively positive and negative ( see table 3 ) , resulting in a small net mean .",
    "thus , in the radial direction , the stellar motions appear to be dominated by a random component rather than by an organized expansion or contraction pattern .",
    "this is correctly reflected by the small absolute value of @xmath53 .",
    "the situation for rotation is clearly different .",
    "we obtain @xmath56 of about 2 km s@xmath0 comparable with the velocity dispersion",
    ". moreover , the individual cross product vectors are clearly not randomly oriented . instead , their components along the @xmath20 axis are systematically negative , their components along the @xmath21 axis are systematically positive , while their component along the @xmath22 axis are around zero ( see table 3 , figure 1 ) .",
    "this suggests that the entire taurus complex is tumbling with a rotation velocity @xmath57 in the @xmath30 plane .",
    "since taurus is a few tens of pc across and the rotation velocity is a few km s@xmath0 , the rotation of taurus induces velocity gradients of order 0.1 km s@xmath0 pc@xmath0 across the complex .",
    "the relevance of rotation to the equilibrium of the taurus complex can be estimated by assuming a homogeneous spherical cloud with @xmath56 = 2 km s@xmath0 at its edge and comparing the gravitational energy with the rotational energy .",
    "we assume that taurus has a total mass of @xmath58 @xcite and a radius of @xmath59 15 pc @xcite .",
    "the gravitational energy is given by    @xmath60    while the rotational energy is    @xmath61    we then conclude that rotation plays a minor role in the virial equilibrium of taurus .",
    "our analysis of the internal kinematics of taurus is based on high accuracy radial velocity , proper motion , and distance measurements of a limited sample of young stellar objects . the comparison ( mentioned in section 3.2 ) of the mean bulk motion of taurus measured here with the determination by @xcite based on a much larger sample ( but with much less accurate astrometric information ) shows that our conclusions are trustworthy .",
    "it will be very interesting to repeat our analysis with larger samples of young stellar objects when they become available .",
    "for instance , the gould s belt distances survey @xcite will provide parallaxes and proper motion measurements similar to those used here for tens of young stars in taurus and other regions .",
    "the gaia mission @xcite will provide data with similar accuracy at least for ysos that are not too deeply embedded into their parental dusty cocoons .",
    "the previous analysis could be repeated for ophiuchus , but the results for internal kinematics would be quite uncertain , because there are only four stars with accurate proper motions , the stars are highly concentrated ( within a few pc of each other ) , and the necessary ( but poorly justified for 2 of the 4 stars ) assumption that all are at a common distance .",
    "we will defer this analysis to a forthcoming paper where additional astrometric results from the gould s belt distances survey @xcite will be incorporated @xcite . here , we will merely use the ophiuchus results to estimate the mean bulk motion of the region .",
    "we obtain @xmath35 = @xmath62 km s@xmath0 , which corresponds to @xmath37 = @xmath63 km s@xmath0 when expressed in heliocentric velocities .",
    "taurus and ophiuchus are fortuitously located almost symmetrically with respect to the sun : taurus lies at @xmath16 145 pc in the direction of the galactic anti - center , at a galactic latitude @xmath16 15@xmath64 .",
    "ophiuchus , on the other hand , lies at about 120 pc in the direction of the galactic center , at a galactic latitude @xmath16 15@xmath64 . in the rectangular system that we use throughout this paper , the mean position of the stars that we observed in taurus",
    "is @xmath65 pc , while the mean position of the stars in ophiuchus is @xmath66 pc .",
    "these two positions are almost exactly opposite to one another in the rectangular frame where the sun is at the origin . remarkably , the mean velocity of the stars in taurus that we calculated earlier ( @xmath67 = @xmath36 km s@xmath0 ) and of those in ophiuchus ( @xmath68 = @xmath62 km s@xmath0 ) are also almost exactly opposite to one another ( figure 2 ) . both the angle between @xmath67 and the line joining ophiuchus to taurus , and the angle between @xmath68 and the line joining taurus to ophiuchus are of the order of 13@xmath64 and consistent within the errors with 0@xmath64 .",
    "this strongly suggest a common origin for taurus and ophiuchus ( figure 2 ) .",
    "indeed , running the time backwards , we find that taurus and ophiuchus must have been very near each other about 23.7 myr ago ( this is assuming a constant velocity ) .",
    "most young stars and molecular cloud complexes in the solar neighborhood are distributed within an expanding structure inclined by about 1520@xmath64 from the galactic plane , and known as gould s belt ( see @xcite for an extensive review ) .",
    "the putative center of this structure is located in the galactic mid - plane , about 100 pc from the sun in the direction of the galactic anti - center @xcite . with this assumed center ,",
    "all nearby substantial star - forming regions in the solar neighborhood except taurus can be accommodated on an elliptical ring inclined by 17.2@xmath64 from the galactic plane , with semi - major and minor axes of 373 and 233 pc , respectively , and a line of node at @xmath69 = 296@xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding dynamical age of the structure is 26.4 myr , remarkably similar to the dynamical age that we derived above for the taurus - ophiuchus system .",
    "yet , the relation between taurus and gould s belt is somewhat unclear .",
    "taurus appears to be _ projected _ in the direction of gould s belt ( and is indeed often included in gould s belt surveys ) , at a location intermediate between perseus and orion .",
    "however , it is not contained in the ring that defines gould s belt .",
    "instead , it is located near the center of the belt ( see e.g.  figure 5 in * ? ? ?",
    "a possible explanation for the peculiar location of taurus with respect to gould s belt was proposed by @xcite ; see also the review by @xcite . in that scheme",
    ", the taurus material would have been ejected from a region located somewhere along the ring containing the star - forming regions in gould s belt .",
    "they argue in favor of a region at @xmath69 @xmath16 245@xmath64 and @xmath70 @xmath16 -14@xmath64 .",
    "our analysis of the relative kinematics between ophiuchus and taurus would be inconsistent with this original position ( which would instead have to lie fairly close to the current position of the sun ) , but the mechanism proposed by @xcite could still provide the correct theoretical framework for the observations . in this scheme , taurus and ophiuchus would originate as the result of an energetic event which would have occurred roughly simultaneously with ( or only a few myr after ) the creation of gould s belt and which would have launched interstellar material on opposite ballistic trajectories .",
    "it is interesting in this respect to consider the energetics . in combination , taurus and",
    "ophiuchus contain about 5 @xmath71 10@xmath72 @xmath73 in material , and they are both moving at about 5 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this corresponds to a total kinetic energy of 2 @xmath71 10@xmath74 ergs , which is only a fraction of the kinetic energy output of a typical core - collapse supernova explosion .",
    "in this paper , we have combined radial velocity measurements with high accuracy proper motion and parallax determinations for a sample of young stars in taurus and ophiuchus to characterize both their internal kinematics and their relative motion .",
    "we find no evidence for contraction or expansion of the taurus complex but fairly conclusive indications for global rotation in taurus .",
    "these conclusions will be strengthened once additional high quality parallaxes and proper motions become available for young stars in taurus and ophiuchus first as part of the gould s belt distances survey @xcite and then from the gaia mission .    in addition",
    ", we measure the relative velocity of taurus and ophiuchus and show that they are moving away from each other at a velocity of order 5 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this points to a common origin , some 23.7 myr ago , possibly related to the phenomena that gave birth to gould s belt .",
