    "the quantum bit ( qubit ) is a new concept for the basic unit of information .",
    "it is an extension of the classical bit and it enables us to develop much more powerful methods for achieving secure communication and information processing . to implement a qubit ,",
    "the information of a qubit ( quantum information ) is encoded in the quantum state of a microscopic physical system that is surrounded by a macroscopic system ( the environment ) .",
    "since the quantum state of the microscopic system is sensitive to the environment in general , it is not easy to maintain quantum coherence of the system during the time taken to perform operations on qubits .",
    "thus , quantum information media has to be appropriately chosen in order to maintain quantum coherence during operations on qubits .",
    "photons and atoms are promising candidates for quantum information media , since their internal states have a high resistance to decoherence due to interaction with the environment .",
    "photons are suited to the transmission and processing of quantum information , and atoms are suited to the storing of that information .",
    "photons and atoms should thus assume complementary roles in quantum information technology .",
    "in addition , an efficient interface for transferring quantum information between photons and atoms is required .",
    "if quantum information is encoded in the polarization of a photon and in the ground and excited states of an atom , it will be important to generate an atom - photon entangled state .",
    "this is because the quantum information encoded in the polarization of a signal photon can be transferred to the internal state of the atom by performing a bell measurement between a signal photon and a photon entangled with an atom .",
    "this information transfer corresponds to one - qubit quantum teleportation by a two - qubit entangled state @xcite .",
    "a controlled - not ( c - not ) operation between two qubits is required to implement atom - photon entanglement .",
    "this operation changes the bit value of the target qubit to its opposite value only when the bit value of the control qubit is 1 .",
    "recently , the implementation and application of the c - not operation for photons and atoms have been studied extensively in the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite , since strong coherent interactions between a single atom and a few photons can be investigated using a small - volume optical cavity @xcite .    in order to efficiently generate atom - photon entangled states , the c - not operation needs to be implemented such that the input photon state must be a single - photon state and the input photon must interact with an atom within a time limited by the decoherence time of the internal state of the atom . for this purpose",
    ", it will be useful to confirm the arrival times and the number of the input photons at the input port of the c - not gate before commencing the c - not operation .",
    "since current single - photon sources @xcite are not perfect on - demand sources ( i.e. , the light that they emit is described as a mixed state of zero- and single - photon ) the above - mentioned confirmation will be especially important for efficiently generating atom - photon entangled states .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a photon - arrival detector ( pad ) , which detects the arrival of signal photon and simultaneously projects the signal input state to a single photon state , with an atom - cavity system .",
    "the performance of the proposed pad is quantitatively evaluated by calculating the detection probability of a signal photon .",
    "the proposed pad enables us to repeatedly detect the arrival of the input photons .",
    "the detection probability of the proposed pad will exceed the quantum efficiency of conventional photodetectors for a small number ( i.e. , less than ten ) attempts , when the linear transmittance per attempt exceeds the quantum efficiency .",
    "the key element of the proposed pad is the implementation of a controlled - phase - flip ( cpf ) operation by an atom - cavity system .",
    "this operation changes the phase of the target qubit by @xmath0 only when the bit values of the control and the target qubits are 1 with each other .",
    "duan and kimble have proposed a scheme for carrying out cpf @xcite . a schematic setup to implement cpf between an atom and a photon is shown in fig .  [ fig : cpf ] .",
    "a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) transmits the x - polarized component of the signal photon coming from the signal input port @xmath1 and reflects the y - polarized component of that photon , where x and y represent any two mutually orthogonal axes .",
    "the cavity is a one - sided cavity and the intracavity atomic system consists of one excited state @xmath2 and two ground states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , making it a @xmath5-type system .",
    "the transition between the ground state @xmath4 and the excited state @xmath2 is resonant with the x - polarized cavity mode .",
    "the x - polarized component of the signal photon excites that cavity mode .",
    "we evaluated the fidelity of the proposed scheme using the cpf operation described by the unitary operation @xmath6 by numerically calculating the shape mismatch between the input and the output photon pulses .",
    "the resultant gate fidelity was more than 99.9 % in the strong - coupling regime described by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the coupling strength between the cavity mode and the intracavity atomic system and @xmath9 is the cavity decay rate .",
    "schematic of the setup to implement cpf between an atom and a photon . with a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) , the x - polarized component of the single - photon signal pulse is reflected by the cavity , while the y - polarized component is reflected by the mirror m. the optical paths from the pbs to the cavity and to the mirror m are assumed to be equal .",
    "x and y are any two mutually orthogonal axes.,width=170 ]    when processing many photonic or atomic qubits on an individual basis in a laboratory , it is important to miniaturize and integrate devices used to process qubits , and not just to increase the repetition rate of individual devices . in order to miniaturize and integrate cpf implementation in an atom - cavity system and to obtain stable optical responses of an atom - cavity system to single photons , it is important to realize solid - state atom - cavity systems .",
    "solid - state three - level systems have been extensively studied in experiments involving v - type systems , which consist of a single ground state and two excited states @xcite .",

    "the probability amplitudes of the signal photon form a wavepacket that is directed to the one - sided cavity and then interacts with the atom - cavity system .",
    "it is assumed that there are only two allowed modes in the cavity : one is a x - polarized mode and the other is a y - polarized mode .",

    "the laser generates pulses to rotate the quantum state of the atomic system between the ground state @xmath12 and the excited state @xmath14 . in this procedure",
    ", the initial atomic state is the ground state @xmath12 . the unitary operation @xmath20 converts the initial state @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) to the final state @xmath23 ( @xmath22 ) , where state @xmath24 means that there is no photon in the signal input port .",
    "the atomic system is changed into the excited state @xmath14 only when there is a signal photon in the signal input port , and it then emits a single y - polarized photon .",
    "the arrival of a signal photon can thus be determined when a y - polarized photon is detected at the detector @xmath25 and a signal photon is simultaneously detected at the input port @xmath1 . since this procedure does not affect the polarization state of the signal photon , it can be repeated until a photon is detected at detector @xmath25 .",
    "this ability to perform repeated attempts will be useful when detector @xmath25 has a low quantum efficiency . in our calculations , the quantum efficiency ( @xmath26 )",
    "was assumed to be @xmath27 , which is a typical quantum efficiency for detectors at optical communication wavelengths ( e.  g. ,  ingaas avalanche photodiode detectors ) .",
    "it should be noted that when @xmath28 rotation is applied by the laser pulse , the corresponding cavity mode is populated and subsequently emits light having the same polarization as the y - polarized photon detected by detector @xmath25 .",
    "we therefore have to wait for the start of the detection of that photon at @xmath25 until the emission from the populated cavity mode is completed .",
    "the desired responses of the atom - cavity system to a signal photon wavepacket for cpf are as follows .",
    "when the atomic system is initially in the ground state @xmath12 , the phase of the wavepacket is shifted by @xmath0 and the atomic state is unchanged . on the other hand , when the atomic state is initially in one of the two excited states @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the phases of both the wavepacket and the atomic state are unchanged .",
    "this response is described by the unitary operation @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 is a operator on the polarization state of the signal photon .",
    "the performance of the proposed pad is quantitatively evaluated by calculating the probability that a photon is detected by detector @xmath31 in sufficient time after the y - polarized photon arrives at the detector , and the probability that the output signal state is a single - photon state after detection .",
    "we term this latter probability credibility. note that the proposed pad includes an atomic system so that its accuracy may be affected by spontaneous emission .",
    "it is thus necessary to analyze the effects of spontaneous emission on the scheme before evaluating the performance of the pad .    in our scheme , there are two spontaneous emissions via non - cavity modes .",

    "the other is the transition from the excited state @xmath33 .",
    "the effects of spontaneous emission of the excited state @xmath32 on the atom - photon cpf have been quantitatively discussed by duan and kimble @xcite .",
    "if the spontaneous emission rate @xmath34 via non - cavity modes is less than the cavity decay rate @xmath9 , the effects on cpf are negligible in a strong - coupling regime for an input photon with an appropriate duration . in the present model",
    ", the effects of spontaneous emission will be negligible since we assume that @xmath35 and that the pulse duration is much longer than @xmath36 in the regime @xmath37 .",
    "on the other hand , spontaneous emission from the excited state @xmath33 is a new error source introduced by our scheme .",

    "this problem is discussed in sec .",
    "to analyze the responses of the atom in a one - sided cavity to a single - photon pulse input , and the temporal evolution of the atomic state for a laser - pulse input , it is necessary to develop a model of spatiotemporal propagation to and from the atom in a one - sided cavity .",

    "for a `` dream '' mirror with a radius of curvature of the order of the transition wavelength @xmath363 , it might be possible to achieve a c - not that is 6.5 times faster than the duan - kimble scheme . for circuits including more cpfs than rotational operations",
    ", the difference in the repetition rates will be significant .",
    "detection of photon arrival based on a cpf using a v - type system was discussed .",
    "the gate fidelity for the cpf was calculated by analyzing the responses of the atom - cavity system to single photon input .",
    "a maximum gate fidelity of more than 0.99 in the strong coupling regime @xmath373 was achieved .",
    "the efficiency of the proposed pad was estimated by analyzing the responses of an atom in a one - sided cavity for laser pulse input and calculating the accuracy and the average total number of counts .",
    "an efficiency of up to @xmath374 was found to be possible by increasing the transmittance per round trip of a signal photon .",
    "there are two drawbacks in the present scheme of the pad .",
    "one is that it takes a long time ( @xmath375 ) to initialize the intracavity atomic system to the ground state @xmath12 before starting the pad procedure .",
    "a long initialization time decreases the repetition rate of the pad procedure .",
    "the other drawback is that the accuracy @xmath329 is smaller than 0.989 due to the linear transmittance @xmath321 being smaller than 1 .",
    "these problems may be solved by direct detection of the excited state @xmath14 in a quantum dot molecule with a quantum point contact .",
    "nevertheless , the proposed pad procedure enables us to apply the pad procedure many times to detect the arrival of input photons and the average number of counts @xmath376 exceeds the quantum efficiency of photodetectors in a small number ( less than ten ) of applications , when the linear transmittance is larger than the quantum efficiency .",
    "furthermore , by minimizing the cavity size our scheme for atom - photon cpf may be capable of achieving a higher repetition rate than the duan - kimble scheme @xcite .",
