    "kondo insulators form a group of compounds that at high temperatures behave as dirty metals but at very low temperatures have their thermodynamic and transport properties determined by the existence of a small gap ( 10 - 100k ) that arises from the hybridization of local electrons and the conduction band  @xcite .",
    "this family of compounds can be characterized as strongly correlated semiconductors due to the @xmath0 or @xmath1 character of the relevant electrons and includes @xmath2  @xcite , @xmath3  @xcite , @xmath4  @xcite , @xmath5  @xcite and @xmath6   @xcite .",
    "many theoretical models have been used to describe kondo insulators .",
    "some of them considered a two - band system , a large uncorrelated band of @xmath7 electrons and another narrow correlated band which describes the @xmath0 or @xmath1 electrons  @xcite .",
    "others considered an anderson lattice , a conduction band and localized @xmath0 states , with the correlation in these states generally treated within the slave - boson method  @xcite .",
    "although kondo insulators do not present long range magnetic order , the occurrence of short range antiferromagnetic correlations in these materials has been observed by inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , suggesting that a good model to describe kondo insulators must include antiferromagnetic correlations between neighbors @xmath0-moments .",
    "we also point out that the magnetic susceptibility of kondo insulators in the curie - weiss regime has a negative curie temperature , as shown in table 1 for some compounds .",
    "this is a clear indication of the presence of antiferromagnetic correlations in these materials .",
    ".table of curie temperature for some compounds [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this letter we study some physical properties of the kondo lattice taking into account short - range antiferromagnetic correlations between the localized @xmath0-electrons ( only first neighbors ) as first proposed by coqblin _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "these authors have used this approach to describe metallic heavy - fermions while here we shall use it to investigate kondo insulators .",
    "we calculate the density of states and study its behavior with increasing temperature and increasing magnetic correlations .",
    "we evaluate some physical properties such as optical conductivity , magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity .",
    "the format of the present letter is as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we present the hamiltonian and describe the approach used . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we calculate the density of states and some physical quantities in order to analyze the influence of magnetic correlations in the system .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian to describe the system @xcite :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 are the spin operators associated to localized @xmath0-moments and @xmath12 to conduction electrons at site @xmath13 .",
    "the first term represents the conduction band . the operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , create and annihilate electrons in the conduction band state labeled by the wave vector @xmath16 and spin @xmath17 .",
    "the second term , proportional to @xmath18 , represents the binding energy of the @xmath0-electrons .",
    "the third term is the @xmath19 exchange interaction @xmath20 which gives rise to the kondo coupling . in this model , following coqblin _",
    "@xcite , we add a heisenberg - like interaction @xmath21 between nearest neighboring @xmath0-moments .",
    "we examine the model above , specifically in the situation where the ground state of the system is an insulating state .",
    "first we construct an effective hamiltonian , rewriting the original one , eq.([hini ] ) , in terms of new operators , as performed by ruppenthal _ et .",
    "al _  @xcite .",
    "since we intend to describe the kondo effect , we choose an operator @xmath22 that couples @xmath23 and @xmath0 electrons . in order to describe short - range magnetic correlations",
    "we introduce another operator @xmath24 that couples @xmath0 electrons in neighboring sites .",
    "these hermitian operators are given by : @xmath25 and @xmath26    the spin components can be written in terms of the new operators . using an additional constraint , that excludes the double @xmath0-occupancy",
    ", we get : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "since we are describing an insulating state at low temperatures , we use the constraints @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore applying the decoupling , @xmath30 we find that the terms containing the number operators cancel out .",
    "note that we are interested in non - magnetic solutions such that @xmath31 .",
    "finally we can write the kondo and heisenberg parts of the hamiltonian as : @xmath32 @xmath33    consistently with the decoupling used above , eq.(5 ) , we deal with the product of operators in equations ( [ lam ] ) and ( [ gam ] ) introducing the mean fields @xmath34 and @xmath35 . furthermore due to translational invariance , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . performing a fourier transform , using @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of neighbors and @xmath40 is the band width , we obtain the effective hamiltonian : @xmath41 where    @xmath42    we have then arrived at a new picture where the magnetic correlations @xmath21 give rise to a narrow band of @xmath0-electrons of effective width @xmath43 ( b is temperature dependent ) .",
    "the interaction @xmath20 ( using @xmath44 , since we are describing the kondo effect ) introduces an effective hybridization between the conduction and the renormalized @xmath0 bands .",
    "the new quasi - particles associated with the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonfinal ] ) can now be obtained .",
    "this is done by calculating the one - electron green s functions which are found from their equations of motion .",
    "these green s functions are given by ,    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    where @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51 we have expressed the green s functions in terms of simple poles corresponding to two hybridized quasi - particle bands with dispersion relations given by @xmath52\\pm   \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{[(1-b)\\varepsilon _ { k}-e_{0}]^{2}+4j_{k}^{2}\\lambda ^{2}}. \\label{polos}\\ ] ]    = 2.7 truein    as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] the two bands are separated by an indirect gap between the lower band at @xmath53 and the upper band at @xmath54 . for increasing values of the magnetic correlation @xmath55 , the indirect gap gets larger while the direct gap remains constant .",
    "the direct gap @xmath56 is governed only by @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath58 and it occurs at @xmath59 .    an insulating ground state , as observed in @xmath60@xcite or @xmath5@xcite , is obtained when the lower band is completely filled .",
    "this corresponds to the half - filled band case where the occupation numbers assume the values @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , we take @xmath61 and symmetric bands with respect to the chemical potential @xmath62 . since the @xmath0-moments are correlated antiferromagnetically , which corresponds to @xmath63 , for @xmath64 we always have an insulating ground state with the chemical potential fixed in the middle of the gap of the density of states .",
    "the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 are obtained from the two coupled equations that have to be solved self - consistently for each temperature : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the fermi distribution and @xmath69 is given by eq.([polos ] )    the present method has many similarities with the slave - boson mean field approach and like it , presents a critical temperature @xmath70 where the conduction and the @xmath0 electrons become decoupled  @xcite . in our model , this arises for @xmath71 which implies the vanishing of the effective hybridization term @xmath65 .",
    "so , these mean - field methods are useful to study the properties of kondo insulators only in the low temperature regime , below the critical temperature @xmath70 of the spurious phase transition .",
    "we shall present results here for @xmath72 such that the present approach is valid .",
    "as discussed previously , the magnetic correlations modify the band structure of the system , increasing the indirect gap . in this section",
    "we analyze the influence of these correlations in some physical properties , calculating @xmath73 and @xmath66 self - consistently for each value of temperature . for simplicity",
    "we consider a uniform density of states of width @xmath40 for the conduction electrons .      using that @xmath74 $ ] we obtain the @xmath23 and @xmath0 contributions to the density of states . in figures",
    "[ denst ] and [ densjh ] , we show the density of states which consists of two hybridized bands separated by a gap .",

    "the density of states become more peaked near the band edges .",
    "the density of states also depends on the magnetic correlations represented here by the parameter @xmath75 . the last term in eq.([hamiltonfinal ] ) produces an effective @xmath0-band and its weight renormalizes with @xmath75 . in a system where the fermi level is inside the gap , the main effects of short range antiferromagnetic correlations are to increase the gap and enhance the density of states near the band edges , as we can see in figure [ densjh ] .",
    "the optical conductivity can be written as  @xcite : @xmath76}{\\nu}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the one particle spectral density of the conduction electrons .",
    "= 3.0truein    in the optical conductivity , shown in figure [ ocond ] , the behavior of the gap involves two characteristic temperature scales as observed experimentally for @xmath78  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "firstly the high temperature regime , compared to the width of the conductivity gap @xmath79 , where the gap @xmath80 itself is strongly renormalized with @xmath81 , as we can see in figure [ ocond ] .",
    "the optical conductivity also presents a drude - like feature at low frequencies , as observed recently by gorshunov _",
    "@xcite in dynamical conductivity measurements in @xmath4 .",
    "this peak indicates that the low - energy transport is determined by free charge carriers .",
    "then the second temperature scale is set by the width of this drude peak . only at small temperatures",
    "the gap is completely opened . at these low temperatures the variation in the intensity of this peak ,",
    "whose weight is transferred to the high frequency region of the spectrum , is the main effect of temperature .",
    "the gap itself remaining unchanged as the low - energy behavior changes from being dominated by free carriers to more localized carriers .",
    "we point out that the interaction @xmath82 has no effect in the gap size of the optical conductivity .      in this subsection",
    "we calculate the electrical resistivity and the magnetic susceptibility for different values of @xmath21 to analyze the influence of antiferromagnetic correlations in these properties .",
    "the electric conductivity is obtained from the limit @xmath83 of the optical conductivity .",

    "the resistivity is given by @xmath86 .",
    "notice that this expression must be used with care . in the problem considered here ,",
    "there is translational invariance and consequently**k * * is a good quantum number .",
    "however in real systems impurity scattering is always present and this limits the electron mean free path . in the calculations presented below , this is taken into account by including a finite lifetime for the conduction electrons .",
    "formally this is done by replacing , @xmath87 , in the green s functions , where @xmath88 is temperature independent .",
    "we point out that here we are interested in the temperature dependence of the conductivity which is not affected by the magnitude of @xmath88 .",
    "if an external magnetic field @xmath89 with its direction along the z - axis is applied , the quasi - particle energies become @xmath90 the free energy in the presence of the field , using the new quasi - particles energies ( [ eh ] ) , is written as @xmath91 and the magnetic susceptibility is given by @xmath92    = 2.3truein    \\a ) b ) = 2.3truein    the magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity can be obtained from the expressions above for different values of @xmath82 and @xmath57 fixed . the calculated low temperature resistivity and susceptibility curves",

    "the fittings of the theoretical results yield values for the transport ( @xmath95 ) and magnetic ( @xmath96 ) gaps @xcite . in figure [ gaps ] we show these gaps for different values of @xmath82 . @xmath97 and",
    "@xmath98 increase for increasing values of @xmath99 but their ratio remains the same ( @xmath100 ) suggesting that magnetic correlations do not influence the relation between them .",
    "= 3.0truein      experimental results yield different values for the gaps of kondo insulators .",
    "the gap measured in optical conductivity @xmath80 has larger values than the gaps measured in neutron scattering and susceptibility measurements,@xmath101 or in transport measurements @xmath102@xcite . on the other hand , comparing the spin and transport gaps ,",
    "experimental results show that @xmath103  @xcite .",
    "the present theory accounts for these observations and introduces a new discussion about the roll of short - range magnetic correlations in the properties of these gaps .",
    "we have discussed in section 2 the influence of antiferromagnetic correlations in the indirect and direct gaps in the density of states .",
    "although in the calculations of section 3 we used a square band , without a defined dispersion relation , we point out that , since our results show that the frequency gap @xmath104 in the optical conductivity does not renormalize as @xmath82 varies , we may conclude that this quantity is determined by the direct gap .",
    "this is expected , since due to the negligeable momentum of the photon , optical excitations involve essentially an energy transfer .",
    "on the other hand the results in figure ( [ gaps ] ) show that the transport and susceptibility gaps are strongly renormalized by magnetic correlations indicating the indirect nature of the gap that determines these physical properties .",
    "in this work we have discussed a model for kondo insulators which takes into account the influence of short - range magnetic correlations in these systems .",
    "we used a kondo lattice with an additional heisenberg term and we treated the problem within a mean - field approach in order to obtain an effective hamiltonian where the additional term gives rise to an effective band width for the @xmath0 electrons .",
    "although the kondo interaction leads to an indirect coupling between the local electrons , we have added explicitly to the hamiltonian an interaction between them . in this way we can make a straightforward analysis of the influence of these magnetic correlations on the properties of the system .",
    "we have obtained the density of states of the new quasi - particles and observed that their energy bands are renormalized by temperature and antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "we have calculated the magnetic susceptibility and electric resistivity to get the magnetic and transport gaps which turn out to be strongly renormalized by magnetic correlations .",
    "calculating the optical conductivity we find a drude - like peak at very low frequencies , as observed recently in dynamical conductivity measurements of @xmath105@xcite .",
    "however , the gap in the optical conductivity remains the same for different values of the strength of magnetic correlations .",
    "this gap is determined by the direct gap in the band structure , while the magnetic and transport gaps arise mostly from the indirect gap .",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlations change substantially the physical properties related to the indirect gap but do not change the quantities related to the direct one .",
    "these observations can produce an insight for future experimental analysis .",
    "this letter discusses explicitly the short - range magnetic correlations which have not been explored previously in the theoretical study of kondo insulators .",
    "the model is able to reproduce their physical properties , including their temperature dependence , and is in good qualitative agreement with experimental results .",
