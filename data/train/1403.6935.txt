    "among a variety of physical systems investigated for quantum information processing , superconducting qubits are one of the promising candidates as quantum processors because of their fast operation capabilities and their potential for scalability.@xcite however , because of their relatively fast decoherence rate which might be insufficient for maintaining quantum information throughout the course of computation , development of quantum memories that could support the operation of the superconducting processors are desired .",
    "such memory qubits have to be addressable at low magnetic field ( @xmath2 mt for aluminum@xcite ) , since superconducting qubits become unoperable at magnetic fields higher than their critical fields .    within this context , a bismuth ( bi ) donor in silicon ( si )",
    "has attracted much attention recently .",
    "its large hyperfine interaction @xmath3 ghz ( ref . ) and the @xmath4bi nuclear spin @xmath5 give rise to a large zero - field splitting of 7.4 ghz that is comparable to the typical energy splitting between @xmath6 and @xmath7 states of superconducting flux qubits.@xcite thus , coherent coupling between a bi spin qubit in si and a superconducting flux qubit on si is in principle possible via a microwave photon traveling through a waveguide placed between the two qubits .",
    "@xcite the proposal to couple bi in si with a superconducting qubit@xcite have triggered extensive fundamental studies of the bi donor in si very recently .",
    "starting from the spectroscopic analysis of the electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr),@xcite the electron spin relaxation time @xmath8,@xcite decoherence time @xmath9,@xcite and superhyperfine interaction with nearby @xmath10si nuclear spins @xcite were investigated .",
    "moreover , the coherent coupling between the bi electrons and @xmath4bi nuclear spins@xcite and dynamic nuclear polarization of @xmath4bi were achieved.@xcite hybrid nuclear - electronic qubits consisting of superpositions of electronic and nuclear spin states have been used to demonstrate five orders of magnitude longer coherence times than the manipulation times.@xcite in order to extend the coherence time of bi donor electrons , magnetic field - insensitive clock transitions can be used.@xcite also , at low temperatures , the presence of @xmath11 @xmath10si ( @xmath12=1/2 ) in naturally available silicon ( @xmath13si ) limits the coherence time of donors@xcite so that the use of isotopically purified @xmath0si is helpful.@xcite the fact that most of aforementioned si : bi studies were performed in the past three years shows how rapidly developing this field is .",
    "however , one aspect that has been scarcely studied is the investigation of si : bi at low - fields to enable the coupling to superconducting qubits . in order to fill in this gap ,",
    "we have shown recently @xcite that magnetic resonance spectroscopy with detection based on spin dependent recombination@xcite ( sdr ) allows to manipulate and detect spins at low magnetic fields .    in the present study , using such a capable sdr technique , we perform spectroscopy of bismuth implanted in both @xmath1si and isotopically enriched @xmath0si samples and observe a significant line narrowing at the hyperfine clock transition ( hct ) , where the transition frequency @xmath14 is insensitive to the change in @xmath15 induced by variations in charge distribution ( @xmath16 ) . while existence of optimal working points ( e. g. , gate voltages ) at which superconducting qubits are immune to the electric charge noise has been demonstrated,@xcite observation of hct in solid state systems has never been reported to our knowledge .",
    "the hct is different from the conventional clock transition , which is insensitive to magnetic noise ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the conventional clock transitions are routinely employed in the operation of atomic clocks@xcite utilizing @xmath18cs and trapped ions.@xcite a similar clock transition of bismuth donors in silicon has been adopted to achieve extremely long donor electron spin coherence time.@xcite hct investigated in this study is more involved in the sense that the hyperfine interaction of a donor can be affected by both strain and electric field fluctuations . away from the hct point , the interaction of a donor ( d ) electron with a nearby implantation defect , which is used in sdr spectroscopy as a readout center ( r ) , causes an asymmetric broadening of the spectral line shapes .",
    "this interaction is equivalent to an effective electric perturbation .",
    "thus we propose a theoretical model that describes the change of the donor wave function due to the presence of this readout center .",
    "this model makes it possible to simulate the sdr spectra and estimate the associated change in the hyperfine interaction .",
    "finally , we compare the line position and the line shape measured by sdr spectroscopy with our calculation and extend the theoretical model for other donors in silicon .",
    "two types of samples were employed ; a silicon crystal enriched to 99.983% @xmath0si ( @xmath19=90 $ ] ppm and @xmath20=80 $ ] ppm ) with a resistivity @xmath21 @xmath22 cm and a highly resistive ( @xmath23 k@xmath22 cm ) float - zone @xmath13si .",
    "these two substrates were ion - implanted with bi and are labeled @xmath0si : bi and @xmath1si : bi , respectively .",
    "the ion implantations were performed at room temperature with the total fluence of @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "the implantation energies were 300 and 550 kev with the doses of @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "these conditions yielded a maximum bismuth concentration of @xmath28 @xmath29 ( above the solubility limit@xcite ) in the depth of 90 to 150 nm from the surface .",
    "the post - implantation annealing , performed at 650 @xmath30 for 30 min in an evacuated quartz tube , led to an activation efficiency@xcite below @xmath31 , resulting in the bi donor concentration less than @xmath32 @xmath29 ( below the metal - insulator transition@xcite ) .",
    "this process was designed to maximize the number of d - r pairs , instead of fully activating all the implanted bi atoms.@xcite      the continuous illumination provided by a 100-w halogen lamp ( above band - gap power of 100 mw/@xmath33 outside the epr cavity ) generated photoexcited electrons in the sample .",
    "the capture of photocarriers by the ionized donors of d - r pairs takes place on a time scale @xmath34 of the order of 10 to 100 @xmath35s for an illumination at 635 nm of 20 mw/@xmath33 at 5 k.@xcite for the phosphorus donor coupled to a dangling bond readout center , the expected recombination time for the antiparallel electron spin pair was typically @xmath36 @xmath35s whereas for the parallel spin pair , the recombination time @xmath37 ms was much longer.@xcite preliminary time - resolved electrically detected magnetic resonance ( edmr ) measurements of bi - r pairs in @xmath1si : bi showed a dynamics similar to the donor coupled to a dangling bond defect situating at the si / sio@xmath38 interface even though the readout centers r created by the implantation were situated around 90 nm deep bi donors . as a consequence , only the parallel spin pairs remained in the steady state under illumination without external induction of the magnetic resonance .",
    "therefore , flipping the donor electron spins by the external magnetic resonance irradiation broke this steady - state constant current situation and decreased the photocurrent by the enhancement of the spin - dependent recombinations.@xcite such a change of the sample photoconductivity led to a decrease in the absorption of the microwave electric field by the sample ( photocarriers ) leading to an enhancement in the @xmath39 factor of the epr cavity . the defect utilized as a readout center in this study had a @xmath40 factor of @xmath41 measured by the cross - relaxation r(@xmath42)-bi(@xmath43 ) ( ref . ) but its microstructure was unknown . in our measurement ,",
    "the sample was placed in the jeol jes - re3x x band epr spectrometer .",
    "a small coil placed near the sample within the epr cavity was used to excite the magnetic resonance . on the other hand , the x - band ( @xmath44 ghz ) irradiation and reflection",
    "were used for probing the change in the sample conductivity . since the additional coil near the sample could apply an arbitrary microwave frequency , it was possible to reduce the frequency along with the static magnetic field.@xcite the second derivative of the reflected x - band intensity with respect to the field modulation was recorded as an sdr signal to reduce the broad cyclotron resonance lines and the background change of the sample conductivity during the magnetic field scan .",
    "all the sdr measurements were performed at 16 k.      the bi donor can be modeled by the spin hamiltonian @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the donor electron and nuclear @xmath40-factors , respectively , and @xmath15 the value of the isotropic hyperfine interaction in units of frequency .",

    "we can exclude the distribution in the donor @xmath40-factor as a cause of this asymmetric broadening , because the sensitivity @xmath65 is negative for both transitions so that the broadening for both @xmath63 and @xmath64 transitions would be in the same direction .",
    "the spin exchange interaction @xmath66 ( ref . ) between the two electrons of the sdr pair can also be ruled out as it would yield a symmetric line broadening for low enough couplings , estimated by lu _ _ et al.__@xcite to be below 5 mhz for phosphorus donor coupled to a surface dangling bond ( @xmath67p@xmath68p@xmath69 ) and below 10 khz for separations larger than one donor bohr radius @xmath70.@xcite the values of @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath65 corresponding to each spectrum in fig .",

    "the simulated line shapes for the pinpointed parameters in ( c ) of @xmath1si : bi and @xmath0si : bi are shown in ( d ) and ( e ) ( red lines ) , and compared to the experimental data ( blue lines).,width=325 ]    for these numerical simulations , we used the experimental linewidth of @xmath0si : bi ( 1.3 g ) measured at hct@xmath157 .",
    "this rather large linewidth can be explained by the dipole - dipole interaction of the donor and the readout center electron spins for a concentration @xmath205 @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , one can expect a spectral line broadening due to the distribution in the donor electron @xmath40-factor .",
    "assuming that this distribution covers a range of @xmath206 ppm around @xmath207 for @xmath1si : bi ( see table [ table1 ] ) , the broadening in the line fwhm , induced by the finite sensitivity @xmath208 ( see table ii ) at the hct , should be @xmath209 g. as a consequence , the distribution in the donor electron @xmath40-factor is negligible for @xmath1si : bi and the fwhm linewidth of the gaussian for the transition @xmath64 is 5.7 g. for @xmath0si : bi however , even a smaller distribution of @xmath165 ppm in @xmath40-factor is responsible for 0.1 g linewidth broadening ( more than 10% of the linewidth measured at the hct@xmath157 ) .",
    "the 0.1 g contribution of the @xmath40-factor distribution to the linewidth is multiplied by the sensitivity ratio @xmath210 .",
    "thus , the gaussian linewidth to be used in the simulations for @xmath0si : bi is 1.35 g. it can be noted that for close pairs ( @xmath211 ) , the strong exchange interaction@xcite can be neglected since the corresponding sdr intensity for @xmath212 @xmath29 is below 0.1 % of the total sdr intensity . the above mentioned linewidths together with the @xmath154 and @xmath156 parameters calculated for @xmath0si : bi lead to the simulated spectra shown in fig .",

    "the experimental spectra are also shown below the simulations .",
    "the line shapes of the transition @xmath64 for both @xmath0si : bi and @xmath1si : bi samples are well reproduced .",
    "this demonstrates the validity of the presented molecular model for the sdr detection of donors for a wide range of host isotope composition .    before concluding this section",
    ", we would like to point out the work of morishita _ _ et al.__@xcite in which the spectroscopy of @xmath0si : p was performed using low - field electrically detected magnetic resonance ( lfedmr ) , a technique similar to sdr . in this work ,",
    "the authors compared the linewidth of @xmath0si : p probed by lfedmr at 160 mhz and by epr at 9 ghz . no difference in the linewidth ( @xmath213 g ) for the @xmath214 transition",
    "was observed and the authors concluded that the interaction of the phosphorus donor with the readout center is strong enough to allow the recombination process , but weak enough not to alter the transition linewidth . yet , the hyperfine structure of the phosphorus donor is only 117 mhz so that its maximum change due to the interaction with the readout center is @xmath215 times smaller for phosphorus than for bismuth .",
    "moreover , the small phosphorus nuclear spin @xmath216 makes the sensitivity @xmath72 relatively small : @xmath217 g / mhz at 160 mhz for the @xmath214 .",
    "thus , the effect of the phosphorus donor interaction with its readout center on the magnetic resonance is below the detection limit and the conclusions of morishita do not contradict the present analysis .",

    "the line thickness is proportional to the absolute @xmath221 value .",
    "the color represents the expected sdr intensity for a conventional continuous wave measurement .",
    "our model shows that the sdr intensity of the hct@xmath157 line for si : bi is much weaker than the intensities for the x - band @xmath63 and @xmath64 lines .",

    "the frequency scale for @xmath4bi is ten times larger than the others.,width=325 ]    there is no hct in the epr transitions of phosphorus donors in silicon .",
    "other group - v donors have @xmath222 hct . at such points ,",
    "as discussed in section [ discussions - position ] , the contribution of the @xmath40-factor distribution to the linewidth can be evaluated knowing the intrinsic epr linewidth and extrapolated for an arbitrary transition .",
    "in fact , since the broadening due to the distribution in hyperfine ( electron density at the donor nucleus ) scales with @xmath223 , the contribution to the linewidth calculated in this paper can be extrapolated for any points .",
    "the values of @xmath224 for epr - allowed transitions of group - v donors in silicon ( @xmath67p , @xmath218as , @xmath219sb , @xmath220sb and @xmath4bi ) are plotted as the line thickness in fig .",
    "one can notice that for a given epr transition , the high - field limit of @xmath225 is exactly @xmath226 and , as a consequence , the field sensitivity to the hyperfine interaction is simply written as @xmath227 also no polarization of the donor spins is required for sdr spectroscopy ; only parallel spin pairs remain in the steady state under illumination .",
    "however , at low magnetic field , the donor eigenstates are not pure spin states .",
    "thus , for one transition , the fraction of parallel and antiparallel electron spins of an sdr pair modified by magnetic resonance depends on the magnetic field.@xcite with such considerations taken into account , the simulated sdr signal intensity for cw - sdr spectroscopy is plotted by the color scale in fig .",
    "in summary , we have performed the cw sdr spectroscopy of @xmath0si : bi and @xmath1si : bi at 9 and 7 ghz and observed a significant sdr line narrowing at the hct .",
    "the theoretical model proposed in this study for the sdr pair electron distribution reproduces the experimentally obtained line shapes very well . by analyzing the line shape at the hct",
    ", we have shown that the main broadening process in @xmath0si : bi is the dipole - dipole interaction between the bismuth donor and the surrounding readout centers .",
