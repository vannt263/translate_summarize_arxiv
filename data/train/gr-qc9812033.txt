    "when a massive spherical shell is accelerated a free body inside it experiences a parallel gravity field , i.e. , the inertial axes inside accelerate .",
    "when the massive shell rotates the inertial axes inside also rotate .",
    "weak versions of these inertia induction effects were discovered by einstein ( 1912 ) in prague@xcite in the early variable - velocity - of - light version of his gravitational theories .",
    "he described them clearly in his 1913 letter to mach@xcite . in weak - field general relativity",
    "he derives them in his book@xcite but the non - newtonian phenomena involved stretch the linearised theory to a doubtful level of approximation .",
    "indeed the mass induction effect also discussed by einstein was demonstrated to be a coordinate dependent effect by brans ( 1962)@xcite .    whereas a series of papers has been directed at the rotation of inertial frames within spheres , etc . ,",

( 1995)@xcite , katz _ et al_. ( 1998)@xcite , less attention has been given to linear acceleration of the inertial frames within strongly relativistic spherical shells .",
    "this is perhaps because of the difficulty of producing strong accelerations in general relativity without severe distortion of the problem to be solved .",
    "near accelerating point masses the effects are complicated by the infall of the inertial frames and the gravomagnetic fields due to motion , but a few have been undeterred by these complications , e.g. , farhoosh & zimmerman ( 1980)@xcite .    in continuation of our studies of mach",
    "s principle & machian effects within general relativity@xcite , we demonstrate here the strong acceleration of the inertial frame _ within _ a massive charged spherical shell of mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 , which is itself accelerated by a strong electric field . to do this we bring the system to rest by applying the equivalence principle and putting the system in an external gravity field @xmath9 .",
    "such a field can be provided by a distant massive body @xmath10 which can also be so charged that it supplies the electric field ( figure 1 ) . to ensure that the principle of equivalence applies , the external tidal field of such a body across our spherical shell must be negligible .",
    "this can be achieved at constant internal potential by shrinking both the shell and its mass @xmath7 in proportion .",
    "we are interested in effects of order @xmath11 in acceleration .",
    "we fix @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",
    "the tidal accelerations are of order @xmath13 which can be made as small as we like by decreasing @xmath8 ( and @xmath7 ) at constant ratio keeping @xmath9 and @xmath10 fixed .",
    "the ratio of the accelerations we are interested in to those we wish to neglect is then @xmath14 which we make as large as we like by taking @xmath15 with @xmath12 fixed .",
    "notice we can do this with @xmath16 held fixed at any value we like so we may study _ large _ accelerations and _ strong _ gravity @xmath17 .",
    "we thus reduce the problem to statics and use the beautiful conformastatic solutions of einstein s equations for charged dust with balancing gravitational and electrostatic forces ( see appendix c ) .",
    "we show that the gravity field inside the massive charged spherical shell that sits balanced in such applied fields is smaller than the applied gravity field by the ratios of the @xmath1 which are themselves proportional to @xmath18^{-2}$ ] .",
    "the problem may seem somewhat contrived in that it is not met in nature .",
    "we argue that it provides an ideal test - bed for study of strong linear dragging by large accelerations with strong relativistic effects and it is most unlikely that a simpler thought experiment can be devised .",
    "however before entering the complications of general relativity it is wise to study the analogous problems in the electrodynamics of flat - space . for them",
    "we can determine truly time - dependent phenomena with the sphere initially at rest and only later given a uniform acceleration @xmath19 .",
    "for the transient behaviour see appendix b. we encounter the oft discussed question whether a uniformly accelerated charge radiates and whether the equivalence principle applies to a radiating charge .",
    "this was well discussed by fulton and rohrlich ( 1960)@xcite but even their excellent paper did not settle the question for some ( rosen 1962@xcite ) .",
    "we have found it particularly interesting to draw the electric field lines of the born ( 1909 ) solution @xcite for a uniformly accelerated charge ( see also schott@xcite ) in several lorentz frames including those in which the charged particle is momentarily at rest ; see figures 2a , b , c , d , e. the field lines are circles that intersect at the particle ( bondi & gold 1955@xcite ) .",
    "we join them far away to the initial coulomb field of the fast moving particle before the steady deceleration brought it to near rest . in that field",
    "there is also a magnetic field with circular magnetic field lines around the direction the particle was moving .",
    "such figures help us to envision how the born solution describes the radiating field of an accelerated particle in the one case but can also describe the non - radiative static field of a particle held stationary in a uniform gravity field ! as boulware ( 1980)@xcite showed , the principle of equivalence still holds in the region accessible to both the static and the coaccelerated observer , but does not hold beyond the event horizon of the coaccelerated observer who can see neither the radiation of the charge that is accelerated with him nor its effects .",
    "for comparison to our sympathetic dragging calculations in gravity , we need the electromagnetic field inside a uniformly charged accelerated shell .",
    "whereas the born field of a _ point _ charge is well discussed , we give here the corresponding field inside and outside an accelerated charged _",
    "shell_. inside the field rapidly @xmath20 settles down to a uniform one but outside the propagation takes longer .",
    "initially we calculate the field for short times only but the near field outside soon becomes that of a charge with a forward pointing electric dipole and no higher multipoles .",
    "these fit respectively the exact born field and the exact field of uniformly accelerated dipole , both of which are known@xcite",
    ". thus our short - time calculation of the dipole moment tells us the coefficient of the dipole solution which should be added to the born field to give the complete solution for the uniformly accelerated shell at all times .",
    "we shall consider times close to the moment when the shell is stationary in our frame .",
    "both charges and currents lie close to the shell @xmath21 .",
    "the surface charge density is @xmath22 so we have a charge density @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the small displacement of the sphere at time @xmath25 . likewise the current on the sphere is @xmath26 hats denote unit vectors .    to find the potentials we wish to solve @xmath27 @xmath28 we first solve for the green s function @xmath29 such that @xmath30 then @xmath31 and @xmath32 now @xmath33    the green s function @xmath29 which solves ( 2.5 ) and has only a retarded solution in @xmath34 is readily shown to be    @xmath35 where @xmath36 is 1 for a positive argument and zero otherwise .",
    "a detailed derivation of ( 2.9 ) is given in katz _",
    "et al_. ( 1998)@xcite .    returning to ( 2.6 ) and using @xmath37",

    "this means @xmath8 much smaller than a light year @xmath43 cm ! evaluating @xmath44 for a general @xmath45 we find @xmath46 or for @xmath47 @xmath48 the fields are readily derived from @xmath49 . inside the uniformly accelerated sphere",

    "\\hfill { ( 2.15 ) } \\cr}\\ ] ]    we have performed our calculation under the assumption that the movement of the sphere during the time considered is much less than the radius of the sphere .",
    "thus the result is only valid provided the times involved obey @xmath53 during this time the signal will propagate to @xmath54 so the solution is only valid where @xmath55 . to get the field at greater distances",
    "we may refer to born s solution for the field of a point charge which is uniformly accelerated in its own frame so its position is given by @xmath56 this is given in appendix a.    we initially expected the _ external _ field of our accelerated sphere on which the charge density was frozen , to match exactly the `` small acceleration '' ( large @xmath57 ) limit of the born solution . however the presence of @xmath58 terms in ( 2.15 ) shows that this can not be the case since in born s solution there is no @xmath8 .",
    "indeed those terms show that our accelerated sphere has a dipole of moment @xmath59 .",
    "bik and muschall ( 1991)@xcite showed how to get the exact solutions for uniformly accelerated multipoles by differentiating born s solution with respect to @xmath57 . putting their dipole equal to the above @xmath60 and adding the result to born s solution gives the exact external solution for our uniformly accelerated sphere , see ( 2.17 ) , etc .",
    "of course if we set @xmath61 our external fields fit the born solution including terms of order @xmath62 but not when @xmath63 .",
    "the physical origin of our forward pointing dipole is interesting .",
    "our @xmath64 field arises as it should from a spherically symmetrical distribution of surface charge . in the born solution the field - lines droop under their acceleration - induced weight ( see fig .",
    "by demanding that our sphere be of uniform surface density we have demanded no droop out to @xmath65 .",
    "the droop of the born field lines is therefore offset by the forward pointing dipolar field we have found .",
    "if we cut born s solution at @xmath65 we may replace the inside with a charged shell but , its internal @xmath64 field is not our @xmath66 but another uniform field whose coefficient is @xmath67 in place of @xmath68 .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the surface charge density on a sphere that gives the born field outside is _ not _ uniform but rather @xmath69 .",
    "it is the internal field of this non - uniform charge density with excess charge at the bottom that reduces the internal field strength from @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "thus our ` exact ' solution for a uniformly charged uniformly accelerated sphere is not born s field outside , but is given by @xmath72 \\phi^b ( r , { \\overline z } , t , a^z ) \\atop \\ \\ { \\bf a } = { \\hat { \\bf z } } \\left [ 1 + { 1 \\over 3 } b^2 \\left ( { \\partial \\over \\partial a^2 } \\right)_{{\\overline z } } \\right ] a^b ( r , { \\overline z } , t , a^2 ) \\right\\ } } \\ , \\eqno ( 2.17)\\ ] ] where , to allow steady uniform acceleration , we have to take @xmath73 , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are given in appendix a.    inside the sphere , which becomes lorentz contracted into an oblate spheroid away from @xmath76 , the electric field is always given by ( 2.14 ) with no magnetic field there .",
    "these properties follow from lorentz transformation of our @xmath77 field .",
    "we discuss the transients when the shell starts from rest in appendix b.    born s field is static in uniformly accelerated axes .",
    "in weak field theory , einstein considered a spherical shell of mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 that was weakly accelerated by some unspecified forces and looked at the metric inside the shell .",
    "we wish to accelerate a massive shell quite rapidly and we need to specify some way of doing it because the stresses involved will produce their own gravity .",
    "we therefore consider a uniformly charged insulating massive spherical shell in an electric field so that every element will accelerate uniformly without any acceleration - induced stresses .",
    "einstein using his 1912 theory@xcite found a uniform gravity field of strength @xmath78 within his accelerating shell , where @xmath79 was @xmath80 using coordinate time .",
    "however in his 1955 book@xcite he gives the weak field relativistic formulae in the de donder gauge .",
    "evaluating these , including retardation in the potential , gives an @xmath81 term ",
    "@xmath82 the analogous electrical one and a @xmath83 term equal and opposite to the electrical one .",
    "so we get from einstein s weak field formulae @xmath84 .",
    "so we should expect a free test body inside our shell to accelerate in sympathy but less rapidly than the shell itself .",
    "however time - dependent problems in general relativity are difficult , so rather than solving a difficult problem we shall use the principle of equivalence to reduce it to an easy one .",
    "the acceleration of the whole shell is equivalent to a uniform gravity field imposed from outside .",
    "if @xmath64 is the accelerating electric field and @xmath85 and @xmath7 are the charge and mass of the shell , then the upward acceleration is @xmath86 as shown in bik 1980@xcite . the extra ` fictitious ' downward gravity field that appears to a coaccelerated observer is @xmath87 , and the principle of equivalence is that the metric felt by such an observer will be the same as that static metric felt when the extra gravity field , @xmath88 , is really present .",
    "to generate such a real gravity field we place a very large mass @xmath10 at a large distance @xmath89 down the z axis such that the gravity field due to it is just @xmath88 that is @xmath90 .",
    "we may also use this mass to generate the electric field @xmath64 by giving it a charge @xmath91 .",
    "then the gravitational attraction of @xmath7 by @xmath10 exactly cancels their electrical repulsion so the whole system is static and at least classically @xmath92 .",
    "because it makes even the general relativity easy we shall take both the sphere and the large @xmath10 to have equal charge to mass ratio so @xmath93 . that is each has the charge / mass ratio of the extreme reisner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "to attain bodies with @xmath94 we put together @xmath95 hydrogen atoms and @xmath96 protons to give @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "then @xmath99 , so we must choose @xmath100 to get balanced electrical and gravitational forces .",
    "this gives about @xmath101 neutral hydrogens per proton , implying a charge of 1 coulomb on @xmath102gm or about @xmath103 coulombs on a solar mass which would give it a potential of @xmath104 volts , far more than realistic values .    with such @xmath105 values",
    "we see that each element of the original spherical shell and the large mass @xmath10 is in balance with the electric and gravitational forces neutralising one another .",
    "but that is just the condition required for the metric to be one of what synge@xcite calls conformastatic spaces , whose metrics take the delightfully simple form @xmath106 where @xmath107 .    take any function @xmath108 that @xmath109 at infinity and satisfies @xmath110 . then defining a proper energy density @xmath111 by @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 we find that the metric solves the einstein - maxwell equations with electric field @xmath115 . here",
    "since these solutions are more commonly described for arbitrary point masses with the appropriate charges we give a brief outline of them in appendix c. now @xmath117 is an operator in @xmath118 space while @xmath111 is a proper energy density of charged dust . to find the corresponding coordinate density of dust we set @xmath119 so @xmath120 , hence @xmath121    for our problem we need the conformastatic metric of a spherical shell with a distant charged mass ,",
    "1 . taking relativistic units @xmath122 , @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the @xmath126 coordinate distances from @xmath10 and @xmath7 . far away from both shells , @xmath127 .",
    "any test mass with charge to mass ratio @xmath128 will be in static equilibrium with balancing gravitational and electric forces if placed at any point in such a metric .",
    "however we shall be concerned with the motion of an _ uncharged _ test mass . placed well away from the spherical shell @xmath7",
    "and at the same distance @xmath89 from @xmath10 , figure 1 , a test mass will accelerate towards @xmath10 with initial acceleration @xmath129 but will the acceleration of a test mass placed _ inside _ the spherical shell be greater or less than @xmath130 ?",
    "relative to freely falling axes the shell is accelerated upwards by the electric field so we expect a test mass inside to have an acceleration in sympathy .",
    "thus relative to static axes we expect the acceleration of the test mass within the sphere to be smaller than @xmath131 .",
    "however in strong field general relativity there are other effects that work in the same direction .",
    "what should we compare , coordinate accelerations , @xmath132 , proper accelerations , @xmath133 , or proper length accelerations using universal coordinate @xmath25-time , @xmath134 ? here",
    "@xmath135 stands for @xmath136 .",
    "one could argue that because time runs slowly at greater gravitational potentials we expect a slower apparent acceleration in @xmath25-time irrespective of any sympathetic acceleration effect .",
    "the equations of geodesic motion in proper time @xmath137 are @xmath138 and the conserved specific energy is @xmath139 , where a dot means @xmath140 . since @xmath141 is @xmath142 along the particle s motion , @xmath143    from the above we find expressions for @xmath144 and @xmath145 . for a body released from rest @xmath146",
    "the initial accelerations are @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149 each of these measures of acceleration is affected by the value of @xmath108 as well as its gradient .",
    "so , if the potential , @xmath12 , due to the shell is large , the acceleration of the body inside the shell will be much reduced compared with that of another body far from @xmath7 but at the same distance from @xmath10 .",
    "whereas in ( 3.7 ) and ( 3.9 ) much of this difference can be attributed to slowed time that does not account for the result ( 3.8 ) where such effects are eliminated by using time as measured on the particle . in these conformastatic models there _",
    "is _ an invariant definition of the gravity field .",
    "all are agreed that the systems are in balance and that any test particle of charge to mass ratio @xmath128 can be placed anywhere in such a metric and will be in equilibrium .",
    "thus the electric field in the static frame ( which is invariantly defined ) must be equal and opposite to the gravitational field @xmath88 .",
    "since the electric field is @xmath150 , the gravitational field is @xmath151 .",
    "so this invariant definition of the gravity field leads us back to @xmath152 . comparing those accelerations inside the shell to those far from it",
    "we have @xmath153 so if @xmath12 is larger than @xmath154 the reduction can be very large .",
    "it is important to notice here that @xmath8 can be as small as we like ; @xmath155 corresponds to an extreme reinsner nordstrm black hole .",
    "indeed as shown by hartle & hawking 1972@xcite our coordinate radius @xmath125 is related to schwarzschild s coordinate @xmath156 by @xmath157 .",
    "we have argued above that this reduction of the test mass s acceleration is due to its sympathetic dragging produced by the acceleration of the surrounding shell ( relative to freely falling axes ) .",
    "however , let us now take the view of the static observer at infinity ; the shell is not accelerating at all .",
    "it then appears strange that this zero acceleration can have any effect .",
    "indeed einstein attributed such effects that did not involve his ` vector potential ' @xmath44 not to any sympathetic dragging but to mass induction  an increase of inertia due to the presence of the surrounding sphere .",
    "the calculation above shows that the reduced gravity field , as seen in the _ static _ frame , is parallelled by the reduction of the electric field .",
    "we do not attribute the latter to any change of charge , so the former should not be attributed to einstein s mass induction but is better viewed as a `` diagravitational '' effect of the potential , similar to a dielectric effect , but reducing _ both _ the electric and the gravitational fields inside the medium .",
    "evidently the sympathetic dragging interpretation in the _ freely falling _ frame is equivalent to this diagravitational effect in the static frame .",
    "the method of the last section can be used to give a finite region of almost uniform gravity field within a single spherical shell of total mass @xmath10 with all charges equal to @xmath128 times all masses .",
    "take @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a constant .",
    "inside , @xmath161 is constant but the gravity field @xmath9 varies at order @xmath162 as it is @xmath163 .",
    "the coordinate surface density of mass on the shell , @xmath164 , is given by integrating ( 3.3 ) across the shell @xmath165 where we have written @xmath166 for the proper surface density per unit proper area ; the metric is @xmath167 = v^{-2 } dt^2 - v^2 \\left ( dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \\right ) \\ . \\eqno",

    "writing it in terms of the physicists gradient per unit distance @xmath179 so @xmath180 and ln@xmath108 is the physicists potential ( in volts say ) .",
    "now this is invariant for purely spatial coordinate changes like that above .",
    "hence the potential due to adding a small charge @xmath85 at the origin ( with the mass appropriate for the conformastat ) is @xmath181 . rewriting @xmath125 and @xmath108 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 we have the potential to order @xmath184 , @xmath185 which agrees with born s field in accelerated axes to this order .",
    "the field @xmath64 is still given in conformastatic coordinates by @xmath186 outside the field is still static and given by ( 4.6 ) but of course the external form of @xmath108 must be used there .",
    "in the last section we had a static charge in the gravitational field of a shell .",
    "it produces the born field locally but no radiation . in section 2",
    "we had an accelerated charged sphere in flat space which produced a ` born ' field with radiation at large distances .",
    "here we analyse the electromagnetic field of a particle which after moving uniformly at high speed has decelerated to rest and will continue its constant acceleration until it disappears whence it came .",
    "we draw the field lines and show that it radiates in a region inaccessible to the coaccelerating observer which does not exist for the static charge in the shell .",
    "then we consider the corresponding problem for accelerated masses producing gravitational radiation .",
    "figure 2a is a space - time diagram with time plotted to the left and @xmath187 upwards .",
    "the reason for @xmath187 up will soon appear .",
    "@xmath25 is plotted leftwards so that creatures of habit can recover their familiar space - time diagram by rotating the page by 90@xmath188 .",
    "the charged particle is confined to the line @xmath189 and at @xmath190 it is moving downwards at a little less than the light velocity .",
    "however it is uniformly accelerated upwards , for @xmath191 , so that the acceleration felt in the momentary rest frames is constant thereafter .",
    "this acceleration slows it to momentary rest at @xmath192 before it continues to accelerate upwards to @xmath193 and beyond .",
    "the space - time diagram is drawn using coordinates and time appropriate for its rest moment at @xmath192 . prior to arrival at @xmath190",
    "the particle was moving downwards at constant velocity so the acceleration only started at @xmath190 .",
    "it is clear from fig . 2a",
    "that a coaccelerated observer who moves with the particle can never see anything in the lower left of the diagram below the shaded line , @xmath194 .",
    "light from such points can never reach any point of the hyperbola @xmath195 .",
    "thus the region @xmath196 is beyond his horizon which is at @xmath197 .",
    "likewise nothing done by such an observer can influence the region below @xmath198 unless it was already done before the particle started to accelerate ( and before the particle crossed out of that region at @xmath199 ) .",
    "figure 2b shows a perpendicular slice of minkowski space containing the @xmath200 plane through @xmath192 .",
    "the lines of force of the born electric field are a set of circles through @xmath192 whose centres lie on @xmath201 , ( i.e. , @xmath202 ) .",
    "@xmath203 is the same point of space as @xmath190 but at the later time ( as reckoned in this minkowski frame ) . beyond the circle of radius @xmath204 around @xmath203",
    "there has not been time for the field to feel the acceleration that started at @xmath204 so the field is the old field that there would have been had the particle continued its prior uniform motion to @xmath205 .",
    "now the field of a fast moving particle is a radial electric field flattened by lorentz contraction along its direction of motion ( see fig .",
    "2d ) and accompanied by circles of magnetic field around the direction of motion ; so this is the field centred on @xmath205 beyond @xmath204 from @xmath203 .",
    "the field lines of the born field in figure 2b droop because in the accelerated frame that travels with the particle there is an apparent gravity field downwards and gravity acts on the field s energy and stresses .",
    "there is no magnetic field in the born region of this diagram because we have taken the time symmetric moment , @xmath76 , when the particle is momentarily at rest .",
    "then the born fields in both the minkowski and the accelerated frames coincide .",
    "there is no transient between the born field and the fast particle s field , merely the circular front ( see appendix b ) .",
    "it is of interest to see how the field in figure 2b evolves at later times .",
    "we draw it in two instructively different ways when the particle has moved on to @xmath193 .",
    "it seems natural to take moving axes and draw the field in the frame in which the particle at @xmath193 is at rest .",
    "we then get figure 2c in which the born part of the field extends farther , the front is now closer to @xmath206 and the original fast particle s field beyond it is more lorentz contracted since in these axes the particle at @xmath190 was moving faster .",
    "it is instructive to see what cut in space - time corresponds to this diagram .",
    "it is @xmath207 in figure 2a .",
    "thus the set of such pictures in which the born field is static are a set of cuts through @xmath206 .",
    "these diagrams only cover the upper and lower of the four sectors through @xmath206 , the others are unrepresented so far .    on the cut @xmath208",
    "the born region has shrunk to zero and @xmath190 is reduced to rest so the field is just that of a static charge .",
    "we have not drawn that figure .",
    "however we have drawn in figure 2d the field lines of the rapidly moving unaccelerated charge corresponding to the slice @xmath209 through figure 2a at time @xmath204 .",
    "this shows the lorentz contracted coulomb field and the associated magnetic field in circles about the motion .",
    "the corresponding slice at time @xmath210 is of course figure 2b . in figure 2e we draw the vertical slice through @xmath193 .",
    "we now reach into the radiation zone invisible to coaccelerating observers and indeed @xmath205 has now moved into that zone at @xmath211 .",
    "the electric field lines are again circles through @xmath193 centred on @xmath202 but now they are accompanied by magnetic fields in circles and start to converge again before joining the old field of the fast moving particle outside the circular front .",
    "some may feel surprised that the fields change discontinuously on this front although the potentials are of course continuous .",
    "one might have expected that discontinuous changes in field would always be accompanied by surface densities of charge or current but in fact such changes can happen on null surfaces as is the case here .",

    "the radiation in the born field one sets @xmath212 which brings one clearly into the `` radiative zone '' of figure 2a and takes the asymptotic form at large @xmath125 with @xmath213 fixed .",
    "this gives @xmath214 @xmath215 thus @xmath64 and @xmath216 are perpendicular and perpendicular to @xmath217 , and fall only as @xmath218 which demonstrates the radiative field in this region .",
    "the only explicit solutions of einstein s equations available today that represent radiative gravitational fields of finite sources have much in common with the born solution in electrodynamics . these `` boost - rotation symmetric '' space - times have two symmetries exhibited by the axial killing vector , and the boost killing vector which , in appropriate coordinates , has the flat - space form , @xmath219 .",
    "the born solution has the same symmetries .",
    "the boost - rotation symmetric space - times represent the fields of `` uniformly accelerated particles '' which may be black holes as is the case for the c - metric .",
    "the `` sources '' of the accelerations are strings along the z - axis .",
    "analogously to the born solution , gravitational waves are found in the region @xmath220 where the boost killing vector is space - like . in the region @xmath221 ,",
    "the metrics can be transformed into static forms  the sources are at rest in uniformly accelerated reference frames , again in full analogy with the born case .",
    "the radiative character of the solutions is best seen on asymptotic forms of the riemann tensor at null infinity .",
    "the riemann tensor falls - off as @xmath218 , in the analogy with the `` radiative fall - off '' of electric and magnetic fields at @xmath222 with @xmath213 fixed , given in ( 5.1 ) , ( 5.2 ) .",
    "in addition , the analogous features of fields due to some specific exact boost - rotation symmetric space - times and uniformly accelerated charges appear even in the radiation patterns and total rates of radiation , as first demonstrated many years ago@xcite .",
    "the structure of general boost - rotation symmetric space - times was analysed much later by bik & schmidt ( 1989)@xcite . in the review `` radiative space - times : exact approaches''@xcite , the main properties and applications of the boost - symmetric space - times are summarised .",
    "born s solution is written in terms of @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",

    "we need @xmath235 @xmath236 @xmath237    since dipoles are generated by small shifts we have following bik & muschall ( 1980)@xcite @xmath238 with an analogous formula for @xmath44 .",

    "however these transients travel outwards with the velocity of light and are seen later at greater distances as we would expect .",
    "transients for other starting times can be found by the lorentz transformation which reduces the starting velocity to rest .",
    "we may apply similar considerations to the case @xmath247 , a point charge started from rest .",
    "the field of a static or uniformly moving charge changes to born s field with a transient that lasts for zero time at each point and travels outward with the velocity of light .",
    "these static space - times , so named by synge@xcite , have conformally flat spatial metrics .",
    "the schwarzschild solution is a conformastat but the best known examples are electrovacuum solutions due to majumdar@xcite and papapetrou@xcite representing extreme reissner - nordstrm black holes in arbitrary positions in static equilibrium .",
    "less known ( not explicitly included in@xcite ) are the conformastatic space - times with charged dust , in which the ratio of the charge to mass densities @xmath248 , is everywhere @xmath249 .",
    "( in section 3 , we took @xmath250 . ) as in newtonian physics the material is in equilibrium because the mutual gravitational attractions are balanced by the electrical repulsions .",
    "this class of exact solutions was studied , for example , by das@xcite , bonnor and wikramasuriya@xcite , and bonnor@xcite .",
    "we did not , however , find a clear simple derivation of the general solutions of this type .",
    "following synge@xcite , consider the particular conformastat form of the metric , @xmath251 where @xmath107 . as a source ,",
    "take a static electric field described by potential @xmath252 and a charged dust with static proper matter and charge densities @xmath253 and @xmath254 ( not initially assumed to be equal ) , in the coordinates of the metric ( c1 ) .    therefore , the energy - momentum tensor of the dust is @xmath255 , and its current density is @xmath256 , where @xmath257 .",
    "the electromagnetic field is described by @xmath258 , with @xmath259 , and the standard energy - momentum tensor @xmath260    the ricci tensor components for the metric ( c1 ) read @xmath261 @xmath262 @xmath263 the scalar curvature is @xmath264 here the standard flat - space notation is used : @xmath265 ( our ricci tensor components are defined so that they have opposite signs to those of synge@xcite in his equations ( 181 ) and his @xmath266 is our @xmath108 . ) now the non - diagonal space components of the einstein equations , @xmath267 imply @xmath268 where we have chosen the sign that corresponds to positive charges and we have set to zero an additive constant in the electric potential .",
    "[ the solution with @xmath269 may be obtained by altering the signs of @xmath270 and @xmath271 . ] using @xmath272 for @xmath273 and @xmath274 for @xmath275 and substituting for @xmath276 from ( c7 ) , we see that the diagonal spatial components of the einstein equations are automatically satisfied . now the last einstein equation to be solved , @xmath277 implies the non - linear poisson - type equation @xmath278 while the sole non - trivial maxwell equation to be satisfied , is @xmath279 with @xmath276 given by ( c7 ) and @xmath108 fulfilling ( c8 ) . by comparison",
    "we conclude that the charge density must necessarily be equal to the mass density or , in non - relativistic units , @xmath280    for _ any _ function @xmath281 which satisfies @xmath282 , eq .",
    "( c8 ) guarantees that the mass density is non - negative .",
    "thus , a solution describing space - time with an arbitrary mass density @xmath283 , which is kept in equilibrium by the charged density @xmath284 , is constructed .",
    "the additional condition , @xmath285 at infinity , makes the space - time asymptotically flat .",
    "the physical ( frame ) components of the electric field are given by @xmath286 these conformastats are useful because one can construct bodies of arbitrary shape and mass density@xcite , or study the model problems as here in sections 3 and 4 .",
