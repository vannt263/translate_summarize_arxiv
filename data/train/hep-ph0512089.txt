    "the gauge / gravity duality @xcite provides new tools to investigate non - perturbative qcd .",
    "holographic dual models which allow the study of confinement and @xmath3sb have been developed in essentially two different approaches : models based on string theory / supergravity in 10d @xcite , or phenomenologically inspired holographic dual models in 5d @xcite . in the past year , a study of meson masses and decay constants in the 5d models have shown quite good agreement with data , at least for the leading meson excitations .",
    "these encouraging results are based on two - point current - current correlators , and in the 5d description the leading contributions to such correlators are obtained from bare 5d propagators .",
    "one can also compute @xmath7-point correlators at tree level ; however , the fact that 5d interactions must be taken into account makes an important difference that we shall investigate here .",
    "the holographic calculation of four - point correlators is a non - trivial test for 5d dual models of non - perturbative qcd , with , perhaps , the most interesting aspect being the holographic computation of observables which are important in qcd , particularly the celebrated @xmath8 rule for kaon decays .",
    "since our calculation is the first within this framework , we focus upon the simplest ads / qcd model .",
    "we start with a review of the relevant facts . neglecting cp - violation",
    "there are two independent @xmath9 decays : @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these two decays are combinations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 isospin amplitudes ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively ) .",
    "experimentally @xmath16 , and the unexpected largeness of this ratio is the @xmath0 rule . in the chiral limit , and at @xmath17 in the chiral expansion ,",
    "these two amplitudes are expressed in terms of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 parameters ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we will also discuss the related but simpler observable , @xmath18 , parameterizing @xmath19 mixing . performing an ope , its calculation reduces to that of the hadronic matrix element @xmath20 of the four - quark left handed current operator @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , @xmath23 involve the @xmath24 matrix elements of two @xmath25 operators four - quark left handed current operators ( above the charm threshold ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    the factorized contribution for these matrix elements",
    "is well known ; the unfactorized contribution is more controversial . in the chiral limit the leading @xmath28 unfactorized contributions reduce to the calculation of integrals in @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 the euclidean momentum flowing between the left handed currents ) of two distinct four - point current correlators @xcite . for @xmath31 , @xmath32 while @xmath4 and @xmath5 are given by @xmath33 in the above , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the wilson coefficients of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39",
    "to compute the four - point correlators through the gauge / gravity correspondence , we consider the @xmath40 and @xmath41 4d quark currents . by virtue of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , these operators couple to the boundary values of 5d gauge fields @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and the 5d gauge fields are massless .",
    "the 5d action is a @xmath44 yang - mills theory @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an undetermined mass scale , and @xmath47 .",
    "the fifth coordinate @xmath48 runs from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , which are the positions of the uv and ir branes respectively .",
    "it is possible to set @xmath51 as in refs.@xcite as our results are smooth as @xmath52 .",
    "we use the ads@xmath53 metric @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 .",
    "the field strengths are @xmath58 $ ] , where @xmath59 , and similarly for @xmath60 .",
    "we normalise @xmath61 , and define the vector and axial gauge bosons as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the holographic dual of this 5d theory is a 4d theory with three quark flavours and a global @xmath64 chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "we work in the chiral limit and include the effect of the spontaneous @xmath3sb via the ir boundary condition on the axial vector fields @xcite .",
    "this is clearly a rather severe limit , yet the calculational simplification it affords makes it worthwhile .",
    "( the effects of spontaneous and explicit @xmath3sb could be treated more precisely by the inclusion of a bulk scalar in the bi - fundamental representation of the gauge group @xcite . )      by the holographic correspondence , the uv boundary values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 act as classical sources coupled to the 4d vector and axial global symmetry currents . moreover",
    ", the 5d action evaluated on the solutions of the equations of motion ( eom ) of the bulk fields defines the generating functional for current - current correlators in the 4d theory .",
    "we therefore need to solve the eom with given uv boundary values of the fields , and substitute back into the action .",
    "the eom are non - linear , so we must solve them iteratively .",
    "this is the origin of witten diagram construction for calculating the @xmath7-point greens functions of operators in the dual theory @xcite .",
    "the iterative solution of the eom requires the bulk - to - bulk and bulk - to - boundary propagators for the gauge fields in the 5d theory .",
    "we work in the unitary gauge in both the @xmath67 and @xmath68 sectors .",
    "@xmath69 is eliminated completely in this gauge if we impose null dirichlet boundary conditions for it on both branes .",
    "we impose warped neumann boundary conditions on the @xmath70 field ( i.e. @xmath71 on both branes ) . in this gauge @xmath70",
    "is a physical field because it has a zero mode which can not be gauged away .",
    "the @xmath65 and @xmath66 propagators have both transverse and longitudinal parts in this gauge .",
    "following ref.@xcite we have @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath66 propagator has a similar form , and both solve @xmath75 the boundary conditions on @xmath76 are dirichlet on the uv brane , @xmath77 , and neumann on the ir brane , @xmath78 .",
    "we impose dirichlet boundary conditions on both branes in the axial sector @xmath79 , to encode @xmath3sb .",
    "the bulk - to - boundary propagator is defined as : @xmath80 ( with a similar equation for @xmath66 ) , where @xmath81 @xmath82 and similarly for @xmath83 .",
    "the solutions are given by : @xmath84 [ c\\mathcal{j}_1(pz')+d\\mathcal{y}_1(pz')]}{2m_5l(ad - bc ) } , % g^{v , a}_p(z , z')_{z > z'}=\\frac{\\pi zz'}{2m_5l(ad - bc)}[a\\mathcal{j}_1(pz')+b\\mathcal{y}_1(pz ' ) ] % [ c\\mathcal{j}_1(pz)+d\\mathcal{y}_1(pz ) ] \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath85 implies the exchange @xmath86 . for the vector sector",
    "the coefficients are @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ; for @xmath66 we obtain @xmath87 , @xmath91 @xmath89 and @xmath92 . in the zero momentum limit : @xmath93 ( @xmath85 again swaps @xmath48 with @xmath94 ) . for the axial sector @xmath95 and swapping @xmath48 and @xmath94 for @xmath85 .",
    "the bulk - to - boundary propagators are then @xmath96 while @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the physical condition of 4d current conservation eliminates the longitudinal piece of the bulk - to - boundary propagators .",
    "the positions of the poles of @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the masses of the vector and axial - vector mesons , respectively .",
    "this is the usual association of the masses of the kaluza - klein modes in 5d with the masses of the bound states of the dual theory @xcite .",
    "note that this tree - level treatment of the 5d model incorrectly predicts that the mass of the @xmath7th excited resonance scales like @xmath7 ( for @xmath101 ) as opposed to the @xmath102 regge behaviour .",
    "this failing is to be expected , as the simple 5d theory here presented is invalid in the far uv @xcite .",
    "we also note that the current - current correlator in the axial sector as @xmath103 is @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath70 propagator in this gauge is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the limit as @xmath107 of the solution of @xmath108 with the boundary conditions @xmath109 , giving @xmath110 the interactions are the three - gauge boson and four - gauge boson vertices derived from the 5d action eq.([action ] ) .      in order to calculate the four - point current - current correlators we have to solve tree level four - point witten diagrams which contain either one four - gauge field vertex or two three - gauge field vertices .",
    "note that certain 5d witten diagrams do not contribute to the four - point functions ( [ wlrlr ] ) and ( [ llrrint ] ) because they do not preserve the flavor structure of the 4d theory .",
    "the three basic structures of the 36 individual witten diagrams : x - diagrams involving the 4-boson vertex , y - diagrams involving two 3-boson vertices , and y diagrams where @xmath70 propagates .",
    "the exterior circle represents the ( uv ) boundary of the ads@xmath53 space , the solid lines are boundary - to - bulk or bulk - to - bulk ( axial or vector ) gauge propagators , and the dotted line is a bulk - to - bulk @xmath70 propagator.,width=264 ]",
    "the three input parameters of our model are @xmath123 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . from the expressions in section",
    "ii.a one can easily compute the boundary  to  boundary propagator in the vector sector , and match its large euclidean momentum behaviour to that known from perturbative qcd deriving the relation@xcite @xmath124 one is then left with the two dimensionful parameters , @xmath125 giving the uv cutoff scale , and @xmath126 setting the ir scale . as mentioned before",
    ", one problem of the simple 5d holographic model presented is that it does not correctly reproduce the spectrum of meson resonances in the regime above approximately 1500 mev .",
    "in addition , in computing the physically relevant observables @xmath4 and @xmath5 one must in practice choose a scale @xmath127 at which to evaluate the wilson coefficients @xmath128 and @xmath129 . one simple choice we make in the following is to take @xmath130  mev , imposing this as an upper hard cutoff when we evaluate the @xmath29 integrals in eqs.([bkint])-([llrrint ] ) , and identifying this hard cut - off with the short distance renormalisation scale @xmath127 .",
    "although this matching procedure is quite crude , refs .",
    "@xcite have shown that such a procedure captures the dominant contributions . in a later longer publication",
    "we investigate in some detail other more sophisticated matching procedures . with respect to the @xmath3pt and perturbative qcd calculations of @xcite and @xcite of the @xmath1 and @xmath8 rule observables , our model ,",
    "if valid , presents the interesting possibility of calculating the intermediate @xmath29 contribution around 0.1 - 2gev@xmath131 directly , rather than fitting it from an interpolation between the @xmath3pt low @xmath29 regime @xcite and of the ope high @xmath29 regime @xcite .",
    "one immediate check on our calculation follows from the fact that the most general form for the greens function @xmath132 in the large @xmath28 limit can be written in terms of the masses , @xmath133 , and residues of the meson resonances @xcite @xmath134 and similarly for @xmath135 with residues @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we have explicitly checked that our results for @xmath132 and @xmath139 agree with this general form .",
    "we now turn to the comparison of our results with the experimental data .",
    "given eq.([ncreln ] ) and our choice of @xmath140 mev@xmath141 , the one remaining free parameter of our model is @xmath50 .",
    "the data to which this must be fitted are , most importantly , the pion decay constant , @xmath142 , the @xmath143 vector - meson mass , @xmath144 , the @xmath145 axial - vector meson mass @xmath146 , and the @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( or @xmath1 ) parameters . in the low-@xmath29 regime chiral perturbation theory calculations",
    "@xcite give the behaviour of the correlation functions @xmath147 with @xmath148 the standard chiral - lagrangian coefficients . in our fit procedure we use the @xmath3pt results , eq.([chptresults ] ) , in the integrals over @xmath29 below @xmath126 , and the results of the holographic calculation , eqs.([wresult ] ) and ( [ siresult ] ) in the regime @xmath126 to @xmath125 .    in terms of @xmath123 , @xmath50 and @xmath49",
    "the predictions of the 5d holographic model for @xmath142 and @xmath144 and @xmath146 are @xcite @xmath149 and in a good approximation in the range of interest @xmath150 ( we use a precise interpolation to the exact result for our fits . ) a non - trivial success of the 5d holographic qcd model is that in the @xmath51 limit ( to which @xmath151 mev is a good approximation ) the ratio @xmath152 is very well reproduced independently of the values of @xmath123 and @xmath50 , as already noted in @xcite .    numerically performing the @xmath29 integrations in eqs.([bkint ] ) , ( [ int2 ] ) , and ( [ llrrint ] ) , as a function of @xmath126 and utilizing , as appropriate , the leading order values of the wilson coefficients @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( taken from @xcite with @xmath155  mev , and @xmath156  mev ) we can fit the final parameter @xmath50 to the full set of observables .",
    "the @xmath157 data requires @xmath158 and @xmath159 , although the values to be explained are modified to @xmath160 and @xmath161 when one takes into account the enhancement already provided by the calculated @xmath162 chiral corrections @xcite .",
    "fitting to @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the values of @xmath142 , @xmath144 and @xmath146 leads to the result @xmath163 which implies ( in all cases normalized to the data for ease of understanding ) @xmath164 and a value of @xmath165 ( @xmath166 using the wilson coefficient value @xmath167 mev ) @xmath168 , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . considering the relative crudity of the model and the use of the large-@xmath28 expansion of qcd",
    "this is a reasonable fit to the data and we find this result very encouraging .",
    "we emphasise that @xmath50 and @xmath49 are the only free parameters in this fit to the five observables of equation eq.([fitresults ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the expected domain of validity of the model ( i.e. in the @xmath29 intermediate region ) , the 5d interactions induce a large increase of @xmath4 and a suppression for @xmath5 .    on the other hand",
    "the holographic model predicts the low-@xmath29 behaviour of @xmath169 and @xmath135 to be identical in form to @xmath3pt but with disagreeing numerical values @xmath170 it is possible that this failing is due to the simplistic truncation of the ads space in the ir .",
    "alternatively , the fault might be with our approximations , particularly the treatment in the 5d model of @xmath3sb",
    ".    it would be interesting to include a bi - fundamental bulk scalar field of mass - squared @xmath171 associated with the @xmath172 operator , as in the models @xcite , and a massless singlet scalar associated with the glueball states generated by the gluon field operator @xmath173 , to see whether their inclusion leads to an even better fit to the full set of observables .",
