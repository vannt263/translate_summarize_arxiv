    "the cs modification of gr was introduced in the framework of the einstein - hilbert formulation of gr in ref .  .",
    "the model , referred to as cs - eh , has been the subject of numerous investigations in the literature@xcite and further understood as providing a way to describe gravitational parity violation .",
    "it can also be viewed as the gr analogue of the carroll - field - jackiw version of extended electrodynamics by a lorentz - symmetry breaking term of the chern - simons kind,@xcite which is one of the many terms of the msme . on the other hand",
    "it could be a means to implement a general relativistic version of cohen and glashow s very special relativity@xcite after it was pointed out that the symmetries of cs extended electrodynamics are those of one of the vsr models.@xcite despite the many successes of this model and the fact that some slowly rotating black hole solutions have been found,@xcite there remains an important unsolved question as to whether or not the kerr black hole is a solution of a cs modified gravity .",
    "to this end we adhere to the viewpoint of treating the cs extension of gr in the einstein - cartan ( ec ) formulation as done by botta cantcheff,@xcite which we will refer to as cs - ec .",
    "namely , the cs coupling is implemented in terms of the so(1,3 ) gauge connection of gr , providing a source of torsion even in the absence of matter,@xcite thus putting torsion at the ` forefront.'@xcite    the action reads : @xmath2=\\frac{\\kappa } { 2}\\!\\int \\!\\!\\left ( \\mathbf{r}_{ab}\\wedge ^{\\ast } \\!(\\mathbf{e}^{a}\\wedge \\mathbf{e}^{b})+\\beta \\vartheta \\;\\mathbf{r}^{a}{}_b \\wedge \\mathbf{r}^{b}{}_a \\right ) \\ ! , \\label{action}\\]]where the riemann @xmath3 and torsion @xmath4 two - forms are defined as : @xmath5    in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) the variable @xmath6 , taken as nondynamical , is the so called embedding parameter and @xmath7 is a dimensionless parameter , which serves as a bookkeeping device that will be clarified below .    the equations of motion for eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) are : @xmath8",
    "equation ( [ torsioneq ] ) reveals the role of the cs term as a source of torsion and it can be solved for the tensor components of the torsion tensor in terms of the complete torsionful riemann tensor to yield : @xmath9 .",
    "\\label{texact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is the levi - civit symbol .",
    "the lhs is in turn defined in terms of the spin connection s components which also enter the definition of the riemann tensor ; therefore the latter is a highly non - linear equation for the spin connection , which we do not aim to solve exactly for the moment .",
    "indeed , the severe observational constraints on the presence of torsion in nature,@xcite which in our case is driven by the cs term , leads us to pose the following ansatz for the dynamical variables : @xmath11 and similarly for the embedding parameter .",
    "all quantities such as the riemann , torsion tensor , etc  are expanded accordingly and zeroth order is to be understood as torsion free .",
    "say we start from a zeroth - order approximation which might be taken as any vacuum solution of einstein equation with zero torsion , thus providing @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath14 according to eq .",
    "( [ texact ] ) and from @xmath14 we solve for @xmath15 , arising from eq .",
    "( [ def r and t ] ) , in terms of @xmath16 plus zeroth - order quantities including the zeroth - order covariant derivative .",
    "next we construct the first - order riemann tensor , according to eq .",
    "( [ def r and t ] ) .",
    "this will introduce an additional derivative to @xmath16 , such that the final equation @xmath17 will be of second order in the unknown @xmath18 , providing the first correction to the metric @xmath19 , thus determining all first - order variables .",
    "second- and higher - order corrections can be obtained iterating the procedure above .",
    "field equations and bianchi identities together result in consistency conditions that must be met by the dynamical variables . for lack of space",
    "these can only be briefly discussed here .",
    "for example , the field equations together impose @xmath20 . applying the exterior covariant derivative @xmath21 acting on lorentz tensor valued @xmath22-forms@xcite on the field equations together with the bianchi identities also written in terms of @xmath21 ( e.g. , @xmath23 )",
    "demands the resulting ( torsionful ) ricci tensor to be symmetric in its components , @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding einstein equation in tensorial components reads @xmath25 , where the einstein tensor is defined in terms of the torsionful riemann tensor and therefore @xmath26 .",
    "finally from the first bianchi identity commented above , we can form @xmath27 , leading to : @xmath28which due to the vanishing of @xmath29 implies : @xmath30we can only mention that , for the cases discussed below , all the necessary consistency conditions of the kind described above are indeed satisfied at least to the desired @xmath1 level .",
    "solving the field equations to first order in @xmath0 as outlined above leads to : @xmath31where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the semicolon denotes zeroth - order covariant derivative .",
    "it is verified that for the canonical embedding @xmath35 and for @xmath36 given by the schwarzschild geometry , the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ finaleinstein ] ) vanishes and @xmath37 solves the remaining rhs . also , the consistency conditions of sec .",
    "[ sec : consistence ] are satisfied too at least to @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the schwarzschild geometry is an @xmath1 solution of the theory . however , though it is not a trivial solution , it can also be verified that @xmath38 solves the equation and satisfies the consistency conditions too .",
    "thus we have found an @xmath1 consistent solution which to first order reads @xmath39 .",
    "identifying @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an spherical body s mass and @xmath42 its angular momentum we can interpret the above solution as describing a slowly rotating kerr black hole if @xmath43 , @xmath44",
    "in the language of the sme , the cs term @xmath45 can be viewed as an externally prescribed explicit symmetry breaking quantity . although this may lead to inconsistencies pointed out in ref .",
    ", here our first concern is to explore the consequences of taking torsion into account in cs extended gravity .",
    "the case of a dynamical @xmath45 that undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking is clearly more interesting but will be dealt with elsewhere .",
    "one of the important consequences that our investigation shows is the possibility to accommodate the kerr solution into the theory .",
    "this may be considered as one of the flaws of the theory in its original formulation , or at least a missing ingredient .",
    "thus our result can be considered as an important contribution in this field , pointing towards the benefits of not limiting attention to spaces of solution with a symmetric connection .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above solution is still valid for @xmath46 , which we call an ` axial ' embedding , producing a symmetry breaking direction parallel to the rotation axis of the kerr metric , i.e. , suggesting that the slowly rotating kerr black hole could be interpreted as arising from the breaking of spherical to axial symmetry .",
    "it is also true that the perturbative expansion here presented may be valid only up to a given order , which needs to be understood further .",
    "nevertheless , this problem is not new in this context , for example , in a previous formulation of cs - ec even the schwarzschild solution was valid up to a given order only.@xcite",
