    "while not yet detected , we can be sure that the earth is bathed in a stochastic gravitational wave background .",
    "contributions to that background arise from the confusion limit of large numbers of distant , conventional gravitational wave sources ( e.g. , binary systems ) , early universe physics ( e.g. , parametric amplification of fluctuations during an inflationary phase ) , and possibly other `` exotic '' physics ( e.g. , cosmic strings ) @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of the ground - based gravitational wave detectors now operating or under construction @xcite is to detect or place limits on the amplitude and spectrum of this stochastic gravitational wave background .    a single",
    ", isolated gravitational wave detector can not distinguish between instrumental noise and a weak , stationary cosmic gravitational wave background radiation .",
    "at least two detectors are needed , in which case the stochastic signal will be apparent in their cross - correlation . more particularly , the two detectors must _ i ) _ have an overlapping frequency response , _ ii ) _ have a separation shorter than the wavelength of their overlapping response , and",
    "_ iii ) _ both sample the same polarization state of the incident radiation .",
    "the ligo livingston observatory ( llo ) interferometric detector @xcite and the louisiana state university allegro cryogenic acoustic detector @xcite , separated by 42.3  km , constitute such a detector pair , capable of providing an experimental bound on the stochastic gravitational wave background at approximately 900  hz .",
    "unfortunately , a weak , stationary stochastic signal can not be distinguished from a similarly weak , stationary noise background that is correlated between the two detectors .",
    "instrumental noise arising from the environment may lead to such a correlated detector noise ; consequently , a convincing case must be made that no terrestrial noise source is responsible for any observed correlation .",
    "this is a daunting experimental challenge .",
    "any technique that can improve our ability to discriminate between a stochastic gravitational wave signal and a weak correlation of terrestrial origin should be pursued .",
    "since the signal contribution to the cross - correlation depends on the relative orientation of the detectors ( which determines their sensitivity to the two different polarization states ) , changing the orientation of one of the detectors will modulate the signal contribution to the cross - correlation in a predictable way , allowing us to distinguish the signal from the correlated noise and leading to a significantly improved estimate or bound on the in - band amplitude of a stochastic gravitational wave background .",
    "the technique of introducing a controlled signal modulation in order to identify and eliminate systematic environmental effects was conceived by dicke @xcite as the switching radiometer during the development of radar .",
    "the allegro group has used a planned relocation of their cryogenic detector to a new laboratory in order to implement the capability to re - orient the detector between data - taking periods@xcite .",
    "this capability now allows for a modulation of the gravitational wave contribution to the detector noise cross - correlation in exactly the manner described .",
    "here we discuss the details of the modulation and how it can be used to improve the reliability of the estimate or limit that we can place on the amplitude of a stochastic gravitational wave background near 900 hz .    the basic scheme for detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background using two or more gravitational wave detectors was described in @xcite and further elucidated in @xcite . in section",
    "[ section : aa ] we review that work and extend it to the case where the two detectors share a cross - correlated noise component . in section",
    "[ section : bb ] we apply these results to the specific case of the allegro / llo detector pair , providing the relevant geodetic and physical parameters that are needed to quantify the magnitude of the correlation and describing how to extract the correlation from observations . in section [ section : cc ]",
    "we present results of numerical calculations based on the initial ligo instrumentation and its proposed upgrade .",
    "the output of each detector  allegro or llo  is a single time series , which is the sum of instrumental noise and a projection of the incident gravitational wave strain .",
    "denote the output of llo as @xmath0 and the output of allegro as @xmath1 and define the correlation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 over an integration time @xmath2 by @xcite    @xmath3    where @xmath4    we discuss the choice of integration kernel @xmath5 below .    to evaluate the expectation value of @xmath6 in the presence of signal and noise , write @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the noise and @xmath9 is the signal in detector @xmath10 .",
    "the signal is , of course , statistically independent of the noise ; consequently ,    @xmath11    where the overbar represents an ensemble average . introducing also the variance of @xmath6 , @xmath12    we define the dimensionless signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath13",
    "as described above , the integration kernel in equation [ eqn : c - defn ] is at our disposal .",
    "if the detector and signal noise spectral densities are known , then @xmath14 can be chosen to maximize the signal to noise ratio .",
    "previous work @xcite has always assumed that the contribution of the noise cross - correlation ( e.g. , @xmath15 ) to the mean @xmath16 vanishes . in appendix",
    "[ app : q ] we consider the more general case where the noise contribution to the ensemble mean cross - correlation is non - zero . in this case",
    "the kernel @xmath14 that maximizes the snr can be conveniently expressed in the frequency domain as    @xmath17    where @xmath18    and @xmath19 is the _ overlap reduction function , _ which describes the amplitude of the correlation of the gravitational wave signal between the two detectors as a function of their relative orientation @xcite .",
    "the overlap reduction function reflects frequency - dependent correlation of the gravitational wave signal in the two detectors and is expressed in terms of their relative orientation and separation . to express @xmath20 for the allegro and llo detectors , focus first on the two arms of the llo detector , which define a plane",
    "( see figure [ figure : coords ] ) .",
    "let @xmath21 be the unit vector along the projection onto this plane of the unit vector pointing from the llo vertex toward the allegro bar s midpoint .",

    "the arms of the llo detector also lie in this plane and , by convention , they are referred to as the @xmath24 and @xmath25 arms . denoting the unit vector in the direction from llo vertex along the @xmath24 arm as @xmath26 and the unit vector in the direction from the vertex along the @xmath25 arm as @xmath27 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 form a right - handed coordinate system with @xmath22 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the bisector of the pair @xmath28 , in the direction of increasing @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and define the angle @xmath29 to be the angle between the bisector and @xmath30 .",

    "the solid line corresponds to the _ ligo i / allegro _ detector pair while the dashed line , labeled ( ii ) , corresponds to the _ advanced ligo / upgraded allegro _ detector pair .",
    "since , with fixed detectors , the upper limit on the stochastic signal strength is always above the amplitude of the correlated noise , figure [ figure : perf]b shows that , after 1  y of observation with _",
    "ligo i + allegro _ , an unaccounted for correlation in the background at the level of @xmath94 compromises the measurement .",
    "similarly , after 1  y of observation with _",
    "advanced ligo + upgraded allegro _ , a correlated background with a strain spectral density of @xmath95 will compromise a simple correlation measurement that does not account properly for environmental correlations .",
    "weber - bar gravitational wave detectors , like allegro , have placed progressively lower upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave background amplitude near 900  hz @xcite .",
    "the present best upper limit on @xmath62 , set by astone _",
    "et al . _ at 900 hz @xcite , used two cryogenic bar detectors operating over a fairly long ( 600 km ) baseline . during a relatively short measurement time they saw no excess correlation between the two bar signals",
    "the planned ligo - allegro observations will be made over a much shorter baseline ( 40  km ) ; consequently , it correlated environmental noises may be more significant and greater attention will need to be paid to identifying and dismissing them .    in the presence of an undetected correlated background , the best upper limit that can be set",
    "will eventually become limited by the bias introduced by the presence of unaccounted correlated detector noise .",
    "for the allegro - llo pair , correlated noise at a level of @xmath96 the geometric mean noise spectral density of the two detectors will compromise the observation after less than 1 year of integration time .",
    "the possibility that geophysical or other terrestrial correlations could compromise the observation in a single orientation of the detector pair are discussed in@xcite ; however , those discussions focus on estimating the maximum allowable correlated background for determining a given value for an upper limit .",
    "we show here how rotating the allegro detector allows us to distinguish between a correlated background and a weak , stationary stochastic gravitational wave signal , removing this limit on the sensitivity of a measurement .",
    "the allegro detector has recently been moved to new quarters and mounted on an air - bearing @xcite , allowing its orientation with respect to llo be modulated in manner described here . in a real observation campaign , the frequency with which the detector can be re - oriented is limited from above by the loss of observing time that is introduced through the disturbance of rotating of the detector and the need for the detector to settle down after rotation .",
    "similarly , it is limited from below by the desire to make measurements in multiple orientations .",
    "a reasonable compromise would be to re - orient allegro every @xmath97 months , while making sure that that exact period is _ not _ commensurate with any obvious seasonal or annual cycles .",
    "the degree of improvement possible with this technique will depend on ( i ) whether the terrestrial background has any component with a characteristic quadrupolar signature that aliases into the stochastic gravitational wave background signature and ( ii ) the degree to which the background is stationary over the separate periods of measurement in different orientations .",
    "nonetheless , an experiment that modulates the stochastic gravitational wave background signature will improve the quality of any long term observation of @xmath62 .",
    "the authors thank both benoit mours and andrea vicere for helpful suggestions and comments during writing of this paper .",
    "we are also indebted to rai weiss for pointing out to us that the idea of signal modulation originated with dicke in the eponymous radiometer that was invented at the mit radiation laboratory at the end of world war ii .",
    "we also acknowledge the assistance of evan mauceli , warren johnson and william hamilton in providing us with the details of the allegro resonant bar performance .",

    "<S> detecting a stationary , stochastic gravitational wave signal is complicated by impossibility of observing the detector noise independently of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> one consequence is that we require at least two detectors to observe the signal , which will be apparent in the cross - correlation of the detector outputs . </S>",
    "<S> a corollary is that there remains a systematic error , associated with the possible presence of correlated instrumental noise , in any observation aimed at estimating or limiting a stochastic gravitational wave signal . </S>",
    "<S> here we describe a method of identifying this systematic error by varying the orientation of one of the detectors , leading to separate and independent modulations of the signal and noise contribution to the cross - correlation . </S>",
    "<S> our method can be applied to measurements of a stochastic gravitational wave background by the allegro / ligo livingston observatory detector pair . </S>",
    "<S> we explore  in the context of this detector pair  how this new measurement technique is insensitive to a cross - correlated detector noise component that can confound a conventional measurement . </S>"
