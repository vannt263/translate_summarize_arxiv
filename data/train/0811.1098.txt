    "vanadium sesquioxide , v@xmath0o@xmath1 , has been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental studies for now more than three decades .",
    "it is considered as _ the _ prototype compound , that undergoes a mott - hubbard transition  @xcite in its purest form .",
    "indeed , the high - temperature ( t@xmath2t@xmath3 ) metal - insulator transition upon chemical substitution , @xmath4v@xmath5cr@xmath6o@xmath1 , is isostructural and no magnetic order is acquired .",
    "early theoretical approaches resorted to the hubbard model to explain the electronic properties of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "however , over the years , experiments indicated that the physics of this material is more involved and a realistic multi - orbital setup is needed for the complexity of the correlation effects taking place . for reviews see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the field of correlated materials gained major momentum from the development of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite . in combination with standard density",
    "functional based methods like the local density approximation ( lda ) the calculation of spectral properties of materials with strong electronic coulomb interactions became possible . over the past years ,",
    "lda+dmft enlightened our understanding of materials such as transition metals , their oxides or sulphides , as well as f - electron compounds  @xcite .",
    "several works highlighted the applicability of the technique to v@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we find that the metal - insulator transition is not due to the brinkman - rice mechanism  @xcite in its single - band form , but results from the impact of coulomb correlations on the crystal - field splitting .",
    "owing to its octahedral oxygen surrounding , the vanadium 3d - orbitals split into two  and three lower lying 2 g  orbitals .",
    "the two manifolds of bands are isolated in energy both from each other and from other orbitals .",
    "the trigonal part of the crystal field further splits the 2 g  into an 1 g   and two lower lying degenerate  orbitals .",
    "the local coloumb correlations result in an increased 1gsplitting with respect to the lda , causing a charge transfer that pushes 1 g  spectral weight above the fermi level . by computing momentum - resolved spectral functions  @xcite ,",
    "we made explicit predictions for angle - resolved photoemission experiments .",
    "recent measurements on ( v@xmath5cr@xmath7)@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 )  @xcite nicely agree with the theoretical spectra , further validating our current understanding of this compound .",
    "an experimental probe complementary to photoemission is optical spectroscopy , which is commonly analyzed in terms of the optical conductivity  @xcite    @xmath11    that is given by a convolution of spectral functions @xmath12 .",
    "the transitions are weighted by dipole matrix elements , called fermi velocities , @xmath13 , and the fermi functions @xmath14 select the range of occupied and empty states , respectively .",
    "@xmath15 is the unit - cell volume , @xmath16,@xmath17 denote cartesian coordinates , and @xmath18 is the response in @xmath19direction for a light polarization along @xmath17 .",
    "both spectral functions and velocities are matrices in the basis of localized orbitals , which we index by @xmath20 , with the usual quantum numbers @xmath21 , while @xmath22 labels the individual atoms in the unit cell .",
    "while the computation of the fermi velocities is straight - forward e.g.  in a plane - wave basis , their evaluation becomes tedious when using localized orbitals as required by many - body approaches such as lda+dmft . to this end , we employ the recently generalized peierls approach  @xcite , which we briefly summarize in [ app1 ] .    in their pioneering work , rozenberg  @xcite analyzed the optical conductivity of v@xmath0o@xmath1 from the model perspective .",
    "it was concluded that the phenomenology of the temperature dependence in the conductivity can be understood by appealing to the physics of the one - band hubbard model . in the current work , we will substantiate and extend these observations , based on a realistic multi - band setup .",
    "our calculation of the optical conductivity is based on the previous lda+dmft electronic structure computation of ref .",
    "@xcite , which used a one - particle hamiltonian that was downfolded  @xcite to the vanadium 2 g  orbitals .",
    "since optical experiments normally probe a much wider frequency range , we employ an upfolding scheme that includes higher energy states on the lda level .",

    "scaledwidth=50.0% ]    shows our theoretical optical conductivity for v@xmath0o@xmath1 at @xmath28=390  k for the indicated light polarization . while in the kohn - sham spectrum ,",
    "the 2 g  and  bands are well separated , the correlations  accounted for by lda+dmft for the 2 g   orbitals only  @xcite  result in an intra-2 g  conductivity that has weight up to energies well beyond the onset of transitions into the  at about 2  ev .",
    "contributions stemming from transitions from the occupied oxygen 2p orbitals into the 2 g  occur from around 3.5  ev onwards .    before turning to a more detailed analysis of the different orbital contributions we compare our results to experimental data ( see ) .",
    "first , we notice the discrepancies _ between the experiments _  : recent measurements on single crystals  @xcite agree well with previous single crystal experiments  @xcite , but they are at variance with measurements using a polycrystalline film  @xcite . while the use of polycrystalline samples especially in a metal might be an issue",
    ", so is the fact that both single crystal experiments were performed up to energies of only a few evs although the extraction of the conductivity involves a kramers - kronig transform .",
    "the low energy shape of the theoretical conductivity resembles the polycrystalline conductivity , but the absolute values differ . as to the single crystal one",
    ", we note that the order of magnitude compares favourably , while the shape tends to be comparable with the high temperature curves only .    at high energies",
    ", we see that both the onset and the shape of oxygen 2p derived contributions agree with experiment .",
    "the upfolding scheme that uses the 2p bands from lda is thus a good approximation .",
    "this seems not to be true for transitions into  orbitals  : compared with experiment  @xcite , we realize that spectral weight is too sharply defined and no identification of particular structures is possible .",
    "this calls for an lda+dmft calculation that includes all vanadium 3d orbitals .",
    "we now turn to a detailed analysis of orbital effects in the optical conductivity .",
    "this is a topic that has not at all been dealt with so far , since previous work neglected inter - band transitions altogether  @xcite .    at low energy",
    "only a small drude - like tail appears .",
    "this can be understood from the underlying electronic structure .",
    "indeed , the metallic character of v@xmath0o@xmath1 is mainly a result from 1 g  charge carriers that have spectral weight at the fermi level only in a very limited region of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , as can be seen in figure 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as can also be inferred from that work , the local spectral functions of 1 g  and  character display a pseudo - gap - like behaviour , and peak at finite energies rather than at the fermi level , accounting for the feature seen at 0.5  ev in the conductivity .",
    "the latter originates from two types of transitions  : at energies lower than 0.6  ev the spectral weight is mainly due to transitions from the 1 g   into low lying  orbitals , that are restricted to a small region in the bz , whereas at slightly higher energies , 0.6  ev and above , contributions are in majority deriving from  to  transitions , which are possible in a wide region of the bz , yet are less prominent at the @xmath29-point .",
    "at this point we again use our knowledge about the electronic structure of the compound : reference @xcite established an important orbital dependence of the quasi - particle coherence scale . indeed , down to 390  k ,  excitations are far from being coherent  : the imaginary part of the  self - energy reaches @xmath30  ev at the fermi level , while 1 g  excitations have reached their coherence regime in our calculation  @xcite .",
    "therewith ( @xmath31 ) 1 g  carriers are ( not ) particularly sensitive to changes in temperature . as discussed above , the low - energy ( @xmath32  ev ) optical response is determined by 1g  transitions , while above 0.6  ev transitions become dominant .",
    "given these two facts , one can  even without explicit calculations  make some predictions about the behaviour of the optical response when the temperature is raised : upon heating , the purely derived contributions will not change as much as will those that involve the 1 g  orbitals , so that the low - energy response will be more sensitive than the weight beyond 0.6  ev .",
    "in particular , a broadening ( and thus reduction in height ) is expected for the very low energy part .",
    "this gives a natural explanation for the dip behaviour that is observed in the experiments when the temperature is raised above @xmath33 450  k ( see figure 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite or our )  ) . ] .",
    "explicit calculations as a function of temperature ( including inter - band transitions ) would be desirable to confirm the picture emerging from our results . this challenging project is left for future work .",

    "as discussed previously  @xcite , we have low but finite spectral weight at the fermi level , which results in some optical weight at low frequency .",
    "unfortunately , no experimental data is available for this composition . compared with pure v@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", we note the suppression of low energy spectral weight and the clear distinction of transitions into the 2 g  upper hubbard bands at @xmath334  ev .",
    "in conclusion , we presented calculations of the optical conductivity of v@xmath0o@xmath1 in its paramagnetic phases using the generalized peierls approach .",
    "we obtain good agreement with experiment and propose an explanation for the experimentally witnessed temperature dependence of the response as a signature of the orbital selective coherence of the system .",
    "our upfolding scheme to include higher energy orbitals captures well the transitions involving oxygen states , but reveal the necessity to include all 3d orbitals in an lda+dmft electronic structure calculation for this compound .",

    "is easily calculated , while using a localized wannier - like basis @xmath41=@xmath42=@xmath43 renders the evaluation tedious .",
    "inspired by the peierls substitution approach  @xcite of lattice models , we can separate the above into  @xcite  : @xmath44\\ ] ] the terms in brackets are the fermi velocity in the peierls approximation , which is here generalized to multi - atomic unit - cell  : @xmath45 is the @xmath16component of the position of atom @xmath22 within the unit - cell .",
    "this velocity is easy to evaluate since it involves only elements of the hamiltonian .",
    "crucial is that @xmath46 $ ] reduces to intra - atomic contributions in the limit of strongly localized orbitals @xmath47  @xcite , which makes the generalized peierls velocity a good approximation for e.g.  3d and 4f systems .",
    "finally , we ask if the computation of the fermi velocities is really necessary in practice , or if one could also resort to a simpler approximation consisting in simply omitting the fermi velocities . due to its simplicity ,",
    "this approximation is in fact relatively popular to obtain qualitative trends of optical properties in correlated systems  @xcite .",
    "since then the conductivity is then a simple convolution of spectral functions , inter - band transitions ( @xmath39@xmath48@xmath49 ) are neglected and intra - band transitions not properly weighted . as an illustration , we show in a comparison of the optical conductivity calculated within the generalized peierls formalism compared to the one computed from the simple convolution of spectral functions , with the bohr - radius @xmath50 . ] : besides the obvious discrepancy in absolute value , omitting the fermi velocities results in a noticeable change in shape , too .",
    "this is owing to the momentum dependence of the matrix elements that favours certain regions in the brioullin zone , while attenuating others .",
    "although the treatment of many - body correlations can often be cast into an effective low energy , downfolded system , the range of its validity is usually far exceeded by optical measurements .",
    "thus it is desirable to allow for optical transitions into higher energy orbitals .",
    "also , the computation of the fermi velocities and the downfolding procedure do not commute  @xcite , and hence it makes a difference to which hamiltonian the generalized peierls approach is applied . as a matter of fact , the wannier functions of a full hamiltonian are more localized than for the downfolded one , whereby the peierls approximation becomes more accurate .",
    "the key quantity for the conductivity is the orbital trace in . for any unitary transformation @xmath51 holds @xmath52 where we defined @xmath53 . in the case of a pure band - structure calculation ( no self - energy )",
    ", we can choose the transformation such that it performs the downfolding , i.e.   the spectral functions @xmath54 acquire a block - diagonal form .",
    "we shall distinguish between the low energy ( @xmath55 ) and the high energy block ( @xmath56 )  : an lda+dmft calculation will add local coulomb interactions only to the former _ after _ the block - diagonalization , which results in a self - energy that lives in this sub - block , while high energy bands remain unchanged and the block - diagonality is retained .",
    "clearly the downfolding procedure is not exact in the many - body framework . indeed",
    "the matrices that block - diagonalize the true interacting system also depend on frequency due to the dynamical nature of the self - energy . yet , when granting the approximative validity of the downfolding , and using the @xmath51 of the band - structure calculation , we can specify @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "the many - body spectra @xmath39 , @xmath59 are substituted into the @xmath55sector , while @xmath60 , @xmath61 of the @xmath56sector stem from the initial band - structure , and reads @xmath62 for transitions within the @xmath55block , the velocity @xmath63 appears , which is the @xmath55block of the _ transformed _ velocity .",
    "it is different from the element computed _",
    "after _ the downfolding . with the above ,",
    "we moreover include transitions from , to and within the high energy block  block . while one can suppress selected transitions by setting to zero fermi - velocity matrix elements , contributions are in that case not additive . ] . comparing to experiments then allows to assess whether correlation effects substantially modify also the spectrum of downfolded orbitals , or whether for them the initial band - structure is satisfying ( see above for the v@xmath0o@xmath1 case ) .",
