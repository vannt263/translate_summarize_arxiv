    "after the discovery of neutrino oscillations , there has been tremendous progress in determining neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "recently , the last unknown mixing angle @xmath1 has been measured rather precisely@xcite and its relatively large value has , also , provided an opportunity for the measurement of cp violating phase @xmath2 in the lepton mixing matrix .",
    "the rather large value of @xmath3 has also forced modifications of models like tribimaximal(tbm ) mixing@xcite which predict @xmath4 , by considering deviations from tbm mixing . on the other hand , schemes like zero textures@xcite , vanishing minors@xcite and hybrid textures@xcite which do not predict definite values of mixing angles but",
    "do induce relations between neutrino masses and mixing angles , readily accommodate a non - zero and relatively large value of @xmath3 .",
    "however , the currently available data on neutrino masses and mixings is insufficient for an unambiguous reconstruction of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the existing data can not , without some additional assumptions , determine all the elements of the yukawa coupling matrices for the neutrinos .",
    "thus , theoretical ideas such as zero textures@xcite , vanishing minors@xcite and hybrid textures@xcite which restrict the structure of the neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath5 ) are important for guiding future searches .",
    "+ in this work , we systematically study the implications of the existence of two equalities between elements ( tee ) of the neutrino mass matrix or two equalities between cofactors ( tec ) of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "there are sixty five such possibilities in each case which have been listed in table 1 .",
    "we find that two equalities between the elements of @xmath5 can be obtained through type - ii seesaw mechanism@xcite whereas two equalities between cofactors of @xmath5 arise from type - i seesaw mechanism@xcite .",
    "+ in the framework of type - i seesaw mechanism , the effective majorana neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix and @xmath8 is the right - handed majorana mass matrix . in the diagonal basis for @xmath7 ,",
    "the zero textures of @xmath8 show as zero minors in @xmath5@xcite . here",
    ", we consider the possibility that @xmath8 has two equal elements and @xmath7 is proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "such @xmath7 and @xmath8 will give rise to the neutrino mass matrix @xmath5 which has two equalities between the cofactors of @xmath5 and the two equalities of cofactors in @xmath5 are corresponding to the equal elements in @xmath8 .",
    "two equalities between cofactors in other words can be seen as two equalities between elements of the inverse of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , effectively we are studying all the possible cases of two equalities between the elements of @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "the condition of two equalities between the elements or cofactors of @xmath5 imply constraints on the parameters of the neutrino sector which leads to a restricted parameter space for these observables . to demonstrate how such forms of @xmath5 can be realized",

    "in addition , there are three unphysical phases @xmath45 which enter in the mass ratios as two phase differences and , in some cases , as a single phase difference .",
    "the masses @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be calculated from the mass - squared differences @xmath46 and @xmath47 using the relations @xmath48 where @xmath49 for an inverted spectrum ( is ) and @xmath50 for the normal spectrum ( ns ) .",
