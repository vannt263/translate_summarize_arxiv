    "clusters present a rich source of cosmological data . if all massive clusters of galaxies are indeed fair samples of the universe , observations even of individual clusters can yield estimates of the baryon to dark matter ratio and mass to light ratio of the universe ( e.g.  carlberg , yee , & ellingson 1997 ; allen , schmidt & fabian 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , rate of formation of the largest gravitationally - bound structures in the universe , which can be estimated from the evolution of the cluster mass function , is sensitive to the mean density of the universe , or @xmath5 ( e.g.  eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ) .",

    "2003 ) , other methods of estimating cosmological parameters provide independent tests of microwave background results .",
    "indeed , even wmap uses external constraints as priors to achieve its most precise results ( spergel et  al .",
    "constraints from clusters of galaxies are orthogonal to those from supernovae studies and from the microwave background ; the constraint from the evolution of the mass function is independent of the hubble constant . furthermore , cosmological studies of clusters test the physics that underlie the assumptions : the physics of gravitational formation of structure and its effects on baryonic matter .",
    "wmap gave us an unprecedented picture of the universe at the time of recombination ; studies of clusters can tell us how well we understand the laws of physics that we assume to predict the current universe , based on what we have seen at recombination .",
    "x - ray cluster samples , such as that drawn from the extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss , see gioia et  al .",
    "1992ab ) , have been used to place statistical constraints on the baryon fraction of the universe ( e.g.  lewis et  al .",
    "1999 ) and on the evolution of the cluster temperature function ( eke et  al .  1998 ; donahue & voit 1999 ; henry 2000 ) . in their normalization and behavior as a function of redshift ,",
    "the distributions of cluster luminosity , x - ray temperature , and in particular , mass are very sensitive to cosmological parameters such as @xmath5 and @xmath7 ( white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ; eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ) .",
    "since the evolution of the cluster temperature function is greater for the hotter and more massive clusters , the estimate of @xmath5 is most sensitive to the evolution of the rarest and most massive systems .",
    "however , the power of all such observations depends on how robustly one can infer the cluster mass based on observations of cluster x - ray temperature and temperature gradients . the intracluster medium of a cluster is usually assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium , nearly spherical , and quite smooth . until the advent of the chandra x - ray observatory mission , x - ray observations did not have the combined spatial and spectral resolution required to prove otherwise .",

    ", we observed one of the most luminous , hot , and distant clusters in the emss , ms0451.6 - 0305 .",
    "our goals were to revisit previous x - ray spectral estimates of the temperature , gas mass , metallicity , and , if possible , to detect the presence of temperature and metallicity gradients and to infer the intrinsic geometry of the cluster .",
    "in combination with @xmath8 constraints from other experiments , we also jointly fit the chandra observations with previous sunyaev - zeldovich observations to estimate the intrinsic geometry and obtain consistent estimates of the gas mass and total mass .",

    "previous chandra analyses of distant clusters ( e.g.  jeltema et  al .",

    "they are both very soft sources with no detected counts @xmath33 kev , and only @xmath34 counts and @xmath35 counts between 0.52.0 kev , respectively .",
    "neither of these sources has sufficient counts to affect the spectral or imaging analyses in this paper .",

    "we masked 3 possible point sources , the two mentioned above and a third even fainter source , but their contamination represented a very small contribution of counts to a spectrum of @xmath38 counts .",
    "we binned the spectrum to a minimum of 20 counts per energy bin in the combined source and background spectrum .",
    "we extracted the events from an identically filtered version of the deep background field provided by the chandra x - ray center . within 0.77.0 kev , 91.7% of the 13,383 x - ray events were source counts . a weighted photon redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) and",
    "weighted area response file ( arf ) were created using the prescription of the chandra science center for ciao2.2.1 .",
    "we first discuss the spectral analysis of the data uncorrected for a time - dependent absorption feature on the acis - s detector .",
    "the extracted spectrum ( figure  [ figure : spec ] ) was fit using xspec ( v11.2 ) .",
    "we used mekal and raymond - smith models with galactic absorption .",

    "the solar iron abundance was assumed to be meteoritic , or @xmath39 solar ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "we found an excellent fit to either model , with very little difference in the best fit or uncertainty ranges for each ( table  [ global ] ) .",
    "the best fit temperature changes somewhat if we fix the galactic @xmath40 value at @xmath41 @xmath28 ( table  [ global ] . )",
    "galactic @xmath42 is @xmath43 @xmath28 in the direction of the cluster ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; stark et al 1992 . ) table  [ global ] lists the reduced @xmath44 and the probability ( `` prob '' ) of finding a larger @xmath44 value given the data uncertainties if the model is correct .    the best - fit results and goodness - of - fit assessments are sensitive to the chosen bandpass ( table  [ bin ] ) .",
    "fits including the energy range @xmath45 kev have significantly higher @xmath46 than fits restricted to higher energy ranges .",
    "no improvements to the fit at this lower energy range are made by including temperature or absorption components in the model . to avoid sensitivity to the soft energy calibration and possible background problems , we restricted our fits to @xmath47 kev for all of our final spectral analyses .",
    "the errors we quote for each measurement are the formal , statistical 90% confidence range for a single interesting parameter ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainties based on these fitting choices are arguably about the same size as the statistical uncertainties for such a hot cluster if no restriction on the fitted bandpass is included .",
    "the chandra global temperature estimates for ms0451.6 - 0305 are consistent with the asca temperature of @xmath49 kev ( donahue , 1996 ; donahue et  al .",
    "1999 ) even though the chandra extraction aperture size of radius @xmath50 pixels ( @xmath51 ) is significantly smaller than that used for the asca observations ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the cluster iron abundance estimate is relatively independent of the technique used to fit the data , @xmath53 solar . as we will discuss in  3.1.2 , the statistics are not sufficient to determine whether a metallicity gradient exists for this cluster .",
    "we investigated the impact of the time - dependent soft energy correction released by the cxc on july 29 , 2002 , which is applied to the `` arf '' file in advance of fitting the data . at the epoch of our observation ,",
    "the correction is mainly limited to the soft bandpass ( @xmath54 kev ) .",
    "the amplitude of the recommended correction is about twice the dispersion of the measurement of the on - board calibration source @xmath55fe l - complex / mn - k ratio , so the magnitude of the correction is very nearly the same magnitude of the uncertainty of the correction .    including this correction in our analysis gave interesting results .",
    "the fit to the global spectrum , with the correction , required a second component which could be either a second , cooler , thermal component or a steep , power - law component ( table  [ tab : soft ] ) .",
    "the second component is a minority of the 0.7 - 7.0 kev spectrum ( contributing between @xmath56 of the flux in the 0.7 - 7.0 observed bandpass ) .",
    "the main effects of the soft energy correction are the following ( see also table  [ tab : soft ] ) :    1 .",
    "models for a single temperature plasma , with an absorbing column that was allowed to vary , settled on a best - fit temperature of @xmath57 kev depending on bandpass , as before .",
    "this temperature is consistent with our estimates from uncorrected spectra .",
    "however , the best - fit absorption column for this model is consistent with zero , and inconsistent with @xmath40 expected from 21-cm data ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; stark et  al .  1992 ) .",
    "since we know we are looking through our own galaxy , this model is probably unphysical .",
    "2 .   fixing the galactic column density towards ms0451.6 - 0305 to @xmath58 @xmath28 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; stark et  al .  1992 )",
    "resulted in unacceptable single temperature fits , ruled out at the @xmath59 confidence level , depending on the bandpass fit .",
    "the best - fit temperature was @xmath60 kev in these models .",
    "3 .   allowing a two - temperature plasma resulted in an acceptable fit with or without fixing the galactic column .",
    "the hot plasma dominates the emission , with a best - fit temperature of @xmath61 .",
    "the best - fit cool temperature is @xmath62 kev when the energy range of 0.7 - 7.0 kev is fit .",
    "that best - fit temperature of the cooler component is sensitive to the fitted energy range , increasing to @xmath63 kev when 0.5 - 7.0 kev is fit .",
    "the hotter component is consistently fit to a temperature between @xmath64 kev .",
    "4 .   instead of a cool component , allowing a soft component with a steep power - law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath65 plus hot component with a @xmath11 kev thermal spectrum fit the data equally well . the data do not constrain the spectral shape of the soft component well enough to distinguish between a power law and a thermal spectrum .",
    "this analysis may also explain the discrepancy between our best - fit temperature for this cluster and that obtained by vikhlinin et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) of @xmath66 kev for the same chandra data .",
    "we obtain best - fit values of the global temperature for the absorption corrected spectrum near @xmath67 kev if we fix galactic @xmath40 and restrict the fit to @xmath68 kev . but",
    "as we discussed above , if we allow galactic @xmath40 to be free , we are required to include a second , soft component , otherwise the implied galactic @xmath40 is unphysically tiny .",
    "most interestingly , this result implies that if the time - dependent , soft - energy correction is correct , there is a hint of a soft excess in our data that could be coming from a `` cool '' component of @xmath69 kev or a power - law component .",
    "we could not place any useful temperature constraints on this cool component except that it is hot enough to be detected in the x - rays .",
    "if it is real , it is contributing very little ( @xmath70 of the emission at @xmath47 kev , and therefore does not affect the analysis elsewhere in this paper , which is limited to @xmath47 kev .",
    "but any soft excess is intriguing , since it could indicate the presence of infalling material or non - thermal physical processes ( table  [ tab : soft ] ) .",
    "the energy dependence of the global temperature fit was presaged in a theoretical paper by mathiesen & evrard ( 2001 ) .",
    "they find that the spectral fit temperature is usually lower than the mass - weighted average temperature in their models , because of the influence of cooler gas accreted in the expected hierarchical cluster process .",
    "we unintentionally followed their prescription for improving the spectral estimate of the mass - weighted temperature by restricting the bandpass to higher energies .",
    "some other theoretical work has been done to predict the contribution of a warm component of substructure to the hotter cluster halo ( e.g.  cheng 2002 ) ; it would be interesting to confirm and characterize this component with higher quality soft x - ray data .      in order to quantify the presence of any temperature gradients",
    ", we divided the photons into an inner circular aperture of @xmath71 and an outer annulus of @xmath72 .",
    "the inner aperture had 6,055 net counts ; the outer 6,268 net counts .",
    "the extracted spectra were binned to a minimum count per energy bin of 20 counts , before background subtraction .",
    "the inner bin contained 97.6% source counts ; the outer , 86.3% source counts . weighted rmf and arf files were constructed as before .    when the same models and fitting constraints were placed on both fits ,",
    "the results were very similar statistically , because the 1-@xmath73 boundaries for one interesting parameter ( @xmath48 ) were large ( see table  [ inner_outer ] . ) for all these fits , the column density was allowed to vary and usually found a best fit value of @xmath74 @xmath28 .",
    "this value is consistent with the nominal galactic column density towards ms0451.6 - 0305 of about @xmath41 @xmath28 ( stark et  al .",
    "1992 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the spectral residuals are not concentrated at low or high energies . adding an intrinsic @xmath40 component does not improve the fit ; a best - fit intrinsic hydrogen absorption column density at the redshift of the cluster is statistically consistent with zero .",
    "we also fit the annuli s spectra with the recently computed correction at the soft - x - ray band included in the arf file .",
    "the poorer statistics of the divided data made constraining the nature of the soft component even more difficult , so we do not report the results in detail , since the bottom line is the same : the model which fits the spectrum of the inner annulus is statistically consistent , aside from overall normalization , with that which fits the spectrum of the outer annulus .",
    "a corollary of that result is that the need for some soft component persisted in both the inner and outer spectrum .",
    "the persistence in both spectra suggests that if the soft component is real and not an artifact of calibration or background subtraction , it is extended , and it is not confined to the core of the cluster .",
    "there were no statistical differences in the temperature and the metallicity between the inner and outer apertures .",
    "however , the strength of this conclusion is limited by the counting statistics of the data .",
    "the difference would have had to be @xmath63 kev to be discernable in these data for a cluster this hot .",
    "the data are consistent with the cluster being nearly isothermal ( at the 20% level ) out to @xmath75 .",
    "we extracted a spectrum from an ellipse centered on the medium - energy surface brightness peak that may be associated with the cluster s brightest galaxy .",
    "( see next section . )",
    "however , the temperature is not well constrained by the 1867 counts extracted from the region .",
    "the best fit temperature obtained from the spectrum was @xmath76 kev ( @xmath77 statistical uncertainties ) , and therefore was not statistically different from the rest of the gas .",
    "an adaptively smoothed image of the diffuse emission of this cluster was created by using ciao s _ dmfilth _ to replace point sources detected by _ wavdetect _ with a poisson distribution based on the sky background local to the sources .",
    "the resulting diffuse image was smoothed to a minimum significance level of @xmath78 ; the @xmath79 binned exposure map described above was smoothed using the same scales as derived for the emission image , then it was divided from the smoothed image ( figure  [ ms0451_adapt ] ) .",
    "we compared the locations of x - ray features to those in the optical by constructing a hubble space telescope ( hst ) i - band image of the cluster ( figure  [ ms0451_hst ] ) .",
    "we drizzled together hst wfpc2 i - band ( f702w ) observations consisting of 4 independent exposures with a total exposure time of 10,400 seconds .",
    "the hst image required a correction to the world coordinate system keywords in the header based on the location of gsc2.2 objects in the field .",
    "the shift was -0.23 seconds in ra and + 1.5 arcseconds in declination .",
    "we note that the nominal center of the x - ray isophotal contours is not located on the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) , identified by a diamond on figure  [ ms0451_adapt ] . the large galaxy to the south of the bcg is a foreground galaxy ( john stocke , private communication ) .",
    "the isophotes near the bcg seem to be distorted , perhaps suggesting that the bcg or a system centered on the bcg may be contributing to the surface brightness there .",

    "we did not detect any evidence for statistical temperature variations in our spectral data .",
    "however , a qualitative assessment of possible temperature or absorption variations across the cluster can be made from the inspection of color maps .",
    "we divided the events data into three energy bands : 0.21.5 kev , 1.54.5 kev , and 4.57.0 kev .",
    "we created monoenergetic exposure maps for the mode of the photons energies in each band , corresponding to 0.9 , 1.6 , and 4.6 kev respectively .",
    "we then adaptively smoothed each image , omitting the brightest point source [ # 6 from molnar et  al .",

    "setting pixel values with exposure time less than 1.5% the total time to 0.0 ) , we then created contour maps ( figure  [ soft_med_hard ] ) .    the main conclusion from figure  [ soft_med_hard ] is that the emission peaks shift with bandpass ; in addition , the centroid of the emission shifts with bandpass .",
    "the positions of the peaks were identified on the maps .",

    "the mid - energy peak has a position angle of @xmath87 e of n that is significantly different from the globally - fit ( see the next section ) position angle of @xmath88 e of n. the global position angle of the 0.77.0 kev data is closer to the position angle of the hardest emission , which is smooth , and the position angle of the @xmath89 contours of the softest emission . in summary",
    ", there seems to be two peaks to the emission , with a soft peak that lies on the bcg and a harder peak that is offset from the bcg .",

    "those members dilute the shear signal by an estimated 10 - 20% , increasing the mass estimate by the same amount .",
    "also , if the dwarfs are concentrated in the core like the giant ellipticals , this effect lowers the measured concentration @xmath298 as well .",

    "we present here a joint analysis of the sunyaev zeldovich effect observations , the chandra surface brightness map , and the chandra spectral fits for ms0451.6 - 0302 .",
    "the sze observations ( figure  [ figure : sze_contours ] ) for ms0451.6 - 0302 were taken at the owens valley radio observatory , ovro , in 1996 for a total of 30 hours using two 1 ghz channels centered at 28.5 ghz and 30.0 ghz as reported by reese et  al .",
    "one point source was found in the cluster field and is located at 04h 54 m 22s , @xmath304 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the spatial parameters of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) were constrained by jointly fitting the chandra x - ray spatial data , and the interferometric ovro sze data to a composite spherical @xmath96model using the jointfit analysis package developed by reese et  al .",
    "the fitting algorithm simultaneously fits the source and background x - ray models and the sze interferometric models using a downhill simplex method that maximizes the likelihood function ( cash 1979 ; kendall & stuart 1979 ; hughes & birkinshaw 1998 ) .",
    "we used jointfit rather than sherpa here to include the sze data .",
    "we are encouraged that the results from both fitting packages , using different statistical assumptions , result in similar x - ray surface brightness parameters and uncertainties .",
    "the parameters s@xmath305 , @xmath90 , r@xmath306 , @xmath307t@xmath308 , and the radio point source fluxes ( in both the 28.5ghz and 30.0 ghz channels ) were allowed to vary , while the cluster central position , point source position , and x - ray background were fixed .",
    "both @xmath90 and r@xmath306 were linked between all of the data sets , the sze decrement was linked between the two sze data sets ; however , the superior resolution of the chandra data means that that data dominated the fits to @xmath90 and @xmath201 .",
    "uncertainties were found by fixing the centroid and the point - source positions and fluxes at their best - fit values and then calculating the @xmath309 statistic over a large range of s@xmath305 , @xmath90 , @xmath310 , and @xmath307t@xmath308 values .",
    "the best - fit values and their respective uncertainties , for a 68.3@xmath311 confidence interval ( i.e. @xmath307@xmath309=1 ) , are reported in table  [ tab : sze_results ] .",

    "however , @xmath8 determined from the sze and x - ray properties of a single cluster is not particularly interesting , since systematic uncertainties , particularly those about the cluster s geometry or shape , are so large . to reduce these uncertainties , it is necessary to obtain accurate spatial and spectral x - ray data and sze measurements for a sample of clusters , or to precisely constrain the geometry and the physical conditions of an individual cluster .",
    "results from a sample of 18 clusters observed with rosat x - ray and sze imaging telescopes indicate that h@xmath308 = 60@xmath325 @xmath326 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ( reese et  al . 2002 ) .    therefore , we take a different approach , and use the constraints on the hubble constant from other projects ( riess et  al .",
    "1998 ; freedman et  al .  2001 ) to determine ( a ) whether our assumption of ellipsoidal gas distribution is consistent with both the x - ray and the sze data and ( b ) whether we can constrain the intrinsic axis ratio of that distribution .",
    "the hubble constant as derived from the sze joint fit from spherical symmetry assumptions ( @xmath327 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ) is somewhat higher than that obtained from type ia supernovae ( riess et  al .",
    "1998 ) , but consistent with that of the hubble key project ( freedman et  al .  2001 ) .",
    "we plot the inferred hubble constant for a range of intrinsic axis ratios , or equivalently , incidence angle @xmath207 in figure  [ figure : geo ] .",
    "if we assume the hubble key project value of @xmath328 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , the implied range of intrinsic axis ratios for the oblate case is 1.40  1.74 and for the prolate case is 1.47  1.82 ( these boundaries are blurred somewhat by the uncertainty in the observed ellipticity ) .",
    "if we assume the wmap value ( derived via an a priori assumption of a flat universe and a power - law fluctuation spectrum ) @xmath329 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , the implied range of intrinsic axis ratios for the oblate case is 1.46  1.67 and for the prolate case is 1.54  1.76 . with either a prolate or an oblate geometry ,",
    "there is room for significant ellipticity in the intrinsic distribution of x - ray gas .",
    "however , we are not required by our data to assume extreme axis ratios . a simple test of consistency between the x - ray data , the sze data , and the assumption of an ellipsoidal gas distribution show that a triaxial cluster model can describe the data .",
    "thus an extreme axis ratio , while not ruled out , is not necessary to explain the x - ray and sze data .",
    "we make this test by deriving the core radius along the line of sight .",
    "we set the hubble constant @xmath330 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ( freedman et  al .",

    "2003 ) and combine the central x - ray surface brightness , the sze temperature decrement , and the x - ray temperature values . the core radius along the line of sight derived by this procedure , assuming @xmath189 is @xmath331 .",
    "that quantity is the geometric mean of the best - fit spherical core radius ( @xmath332 ) and the best - fit elliptical core radius ( @xmath333 ) in the plane of the sky , as might be expected for a triaxial distribution of gas ( i.e. , intermediate between a prolate and an oblate distribution . )",

    "a table of the results for @xmath208 is provided ( table  [ masses ] ) .",
    "we computed the inferred gravitational mass distribution for the ellipsoidal geometries .",
    "the total mass inside a sphere was not very sensitive to the assumed geometry . at @xmath335 mpc , the differences between the enclosed masses were less than 1% for models consistent with observed cluster parameters .",
    "we plot the gas mass , total mass , and gas fraction as a function of radius for three geometric assumptions in figure  [ figure:3mass ] . on this plot",
    ", a vertical line marks the radius ( @xmath336 kpc ) out to which we fit the x - ray surface brightness data .",
    "we note that the gas fraction is relatively constant at this radius and beyond .",
    "recall that the ellipsoidal @xmath96model should only be used perturbatively ( that is , for axis ratios not too much larger than 1.0 ) , because it assumes that the gas is distributed on ellipsoids which are concentric and which do not change in eccentricity or position angle as a function of radius . for extreme axis ratios ,",
    "this assumption breaks down .",
    "ideally , one might want to look at cluster models generated by hydrodynamic numerical studies , which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we also computed the ratio of the projected gravitational mass to the mass inside a sphere for a symmetry axis angle of 90 degrees ( figure  [ cyl_ratio ] ) .",
    "a range of ratios up to @xmath337 at @xmath228 mpc is possible between the projected lensing mass and the x - ray mass between the projected mass and the mass inside a sphere .",
    "the differences in the factor for correcting the projected mass to a spherical mass could be of order 40% , depending on whether one assumes a prolate or an oblate model .",
    "using chandra x - ray data for the cluster of galaxies ms0451.6 - 0321 , we have confirmed that the x - ray temperature is @xmath338 kev ( 90% confidence range ) .",
    "the best - fit temperature with the current calibration still has an additional 0.5 - 1.0 kev systematic uncertainty because of the sensitivity to the energy bounds of the spectral fit and the possible presence of a soft component .",
    "we also detected iron , at @xmath339 solar abundances .",
    "the unambiguous presence of iron at the level of present - day cluster gas metallicities confirms the lack of metallicity evolution in cluster gas since @xmath340 .",
    "the cluster is decidedly elliptical in appearance .",
    "the peak and centroid of the x - ray surface brightness shifts from the bcg in the soft x - ray map several arcseconds to the east in the hard x - ray map .",
    "we fit the surface brightness of the cluster to spherical and elliptical @xmath96models .",
    "the parameters of these fits were used to derive the central electron density , the gas mass , the total mass , and the gas fraction in the cluster as a function of radius and of assumed geometry .",
    "we explore the the effects of the assumptions of spherically symmetric and ellipsoidal gas distributions .",
    "the underlying gravitational potential was inferred from the distribution of the hot gas assuming the gas is approximately hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the 0.77.0 kev emission is dominated at the 9599% level by the hot component .",
    "the gas mass is somewhat sensitive to the geometry , but the total mass inside a sphere is not .",
    "the gas fractions of @xmath341 imply @xmath5 of @xmath342 , if @xmath343 . using wmap results for @xmath5 and @xmath344 , the hot gas fraction for this cluster ( and other clusters )",
    "imply that over 2/3 of the baryons in the universe are in between the galaxies , in an icm or an igm .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich data allows us to test the ellipsoidal assumption for consistency , if @xmath8 constraints are adopted from other experiments such as the hst key project results , and if the effect of gas clumpiness is minimal .",
    "we find that the data ( x - ray , sze , and weak - lensing ) are completely consistent with a triaxial distribution of gas , intermediate between the prolate and oblate cases .",
    "extreme axis ratios are not necessary to explain all three datasets",
    ". a full - fledged reconstruction of the cluster may be possible with improved sze , x - ray , and weak lensing data , as has been suggested by fox & pen ( 2002 ) .",
    "the overall distribution of x - ray emitting plasma in ms0451.6 - 0305 is ellipsoidal , and appears to be nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we do not see obvious signs of shocks in the hot gas .",
    "shocks may have been seen in the form of linear features , or surface brightness enhancements , or hard ( 2.07.0 kev ) features that depart from the overall shape of the cluster .",
    "elliptical surface brightness distributions themselves are consistent with relatively relaxed gravitational systems .",
    "we note our assumptions here of constant ellipticity with radius and of concentricity get increasingly poor at larger radii .",
    "an elongated distribution of gas could result from filamentary , rather than spherically symmetric , infall .",
    "infall along filaments is predicted from numerical simulations of cluster formation .",
    "violent relaxation can result in a triaxial system , such as in an elliptical galaxy .",
    "the systems may continue to interact via two - body interaction processes , but these processes only very slowly modify the gravitating structure of a cluster of galaxies .",
    "however , though the surface brightness data show an ellipsoidal distribution of gas , there is evidence for small departures from smoothness at the core . in particular , multi - bandpass x - ray data as revealed by maps of adaptively smoothed soft , mid- , and hard energy band data suggest that the cluster core profile may consist of an x - ray luminous gas system surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) , which perhaps is not yet settled into the center of the cluster .",
    "the centroid of the hardest x - ray emission is not centered on the bcg .",
    "the residuals from the fit of an elliptical beta - model to the surface brightness data reveal excesses to the south and to the east , corresponding to the structures revealed in the color images .",
    "we also note that the extrapolated mass at @xmath196 and especially at @xmath297 is sensitive to the polytropic index assumed . the ratio between an isothermal ( @xmath345 ) mass and a @xmath192 polytropic mass at @xmath346 ( for this cluster ) was 1.8 .",
    "such a difference is of order the difference between the theoretical mass - temperature relation ( e.g.  evrard et  al .",
    "1996 ) and the observed mass - temperature relation ( e.g.  finoguenov , reiprich , & bhringer 2001 ; horner , mushotzky , & scharf 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , reliable temperature gradients are essential towards solving that discrepancy .    in conclusion , we believe we have evidence that ms0451.6 - 0305 is not in perfect gravitational equilibrium since there is a hint that the bcg may be just now settling into the cluster core .",
    "however , this interaction does not seem to be creating a violent merger shock , since the hard x - ray image appears to be relatively symmetric , smooth , and single peaked , without any elongated or filametary features .",
    "the global , hot temperature of this system , therefore , is likely to be representative of the cluster potential .",
    "we have , to the extent the chandra data allows , confirmed that this cluster is indeed as hot and massive as previous asca observations ( donahue 1996 ; donahue et  al .  1999 ) .",
    "additional evidence for the high mass of this cluster is found in the velocity dispersion ( carlberg et  al .",
    "1996 ) , and weak lensing data ( clowe et  al .",
    "2000 ) , which present mass measurements consistent with the x - ray data .",
    "we find some evidence for departures from equilibrium in the core of the cluster .",
    "these structures , resolved by chandra but blurred by rosat , mean that the surface brightness fit for this cluster based on rosat had somewhat larger , flatter core .    we find a suggestion of a soft component contributing to the emission at @xmath347 kev .",
    "this component , if real and not an artifact of calibration and background subtraction , is not confined to the core .",
    "our data are not sufficient to distinguish a thermal from a non - thermal spectrum for this component , as a power - law , a zero - metallicity thermal spectrum and a 40% solar metallicity thermal spectrum all adequately fit the soft data .",
    "deep xmm observations of the same cluster would be useful to confirm the soft emission and to test for the presence of fe lines from @xmath348 kev thermal gas .",
    "the 210 kev rest luminosity of this component is consistent with that of luminous member ellipticals or a group , similar to what has been seen in coma in both the ellipticals ( vikhlinin et  al .  2001 ) and the groups and filamentary substructures ( neumann et  al .  2003 ) .",
    "this component does not significantly affect the analysis of the hot phase , but it is intriguing and worth further study .",
    "the consistency between the x - ray and sunyaev - zeldovich estimates of the central electron density and the consistency between the x - ray , weak lensing , and optical estimates of the virial mass of the cluster suggest that despite the ellipsoidal appearance of ms0451.6 - 0302 , the global properties of this clusters are useful for cosmological studies , independent constraints on @xmath5 , and for an assessment of the hot baryon fraction in massive halos .    most fundamentally , this chandra study , along with a similar chandra study for another emss cluster , ms1054 - 0302 ( jeltema et  al .",
    "2001 ) , confirms the presence of high - redshift , massive clusters inside the emss survey volume .",
    "the existence of these massive clusters in a small volume is the key observational ingredient in studies of cluster evolution leading to the conclusion of a low value of @xmath5 ( e.g.  eke et  al .",
    "1998 , donahue et  al .",
    "1998 , donahue & voit 1999 , henry 2000 . ) such studies compare the temperature function of clusters now with the temperature function of clusters in the past . since structure formation is very sensitive to the ambient matter density , the evolution of the mass function of clusters is very sensitive to @xmath5 .",
    "since we have confirmed that ms0451.6 - 0321 is indeed very massive , whether weighed using x - ray temperatures , optical velocities , or weak lensing signals , we have confirmed the high mass of this cluster , and therefore the conclusion of a low - density universe .",
