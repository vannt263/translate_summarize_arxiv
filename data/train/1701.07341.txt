    "the study presented in this paper was developed in the context of the advanced lbt turbulence and atmosphere ( alta center ) project , which aims to implement an automated forecast system for the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) using non - hydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric models .",
    "the purpose of alta is to perform forecasts of classical atmospheric parameters ( wind speed and direction , temperature , relative humidity ) which are relevant for ground - based astronomy and astroclimatic parameters ( @xmath3 profiles , seeing @xmath4 , isoplanatic angle @xmath5 , wavefront coherence time @xmath6 ) to support ground - based observations of lbt .",
    "the forecasts of all these parameters are crucial for the telescope operations and are relevant for adaptive optics applications ( ao ) . + in the context of this extended project ,",
    "the goal of this paper is to validate the forecasts of atmospheric parameters ( temperature , relative humidity , wind speed and direction ) close to the ground above mount graham ( arizona ) , site of the lbt , by comparing outputs of the model ( i.e. the forecast system ) with measurements of the same parameters ( stored in the telescope telemetry ) taken by instruments placed on the telescope .",
    "more precisely this paper quantifies the confidence level of the model predictions of the parameters just cited .",
    "+ the knowledge in advance of the value of these parameters close to the ground is crucial to maximize the efficiency of the telescope operations and the scheduling of the planned observations .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite - section 2 in which it is extensively explained how the atmospheric parameters close to the ground play a fundamental role in optimizing the ground - based observations of telescope facilities , particularly if they are supported by ao systems . here",
    "we summarize the main arguments .",
    "the dome seeing , one of the main contributions to total seeing , is proportional to the temperature gradients between primary mirror , dome temperature and external temperature , thus knowing in advance the temperature close to the ground is fundamental to minimize the thermal gradients and , as a consequence , the dome seeing .",
    "the wind speed close to the ground is the main cause of vibrations of the telescope mirrors .",
    "the noise produced by the wind bursts is one of the main causes of error introduced in the ao systems .",
    "this effect is mostly visible when the wind hits frontally the mirrors , while it is minimal when hitting laterally .",
    "precise knowledge in advance of the wind direction helps in selecting the suitable part of the sky used for observations , in order to minimize the impact of strong winds on ao systems .",
    "also wind direction is known to be well correlated to seeing conditions .",
    "the relative humidity forecast is very useful to be able to close the dome when the rh reaches values larger than the fixed threshold . of course all these elements , joint with the forecast of the optical turbulence ( not analyzed in this paper ) , will contribute to optimize the scheduling of telescope observations and the telescope scientific outputs .",
    "+ the alta center is integral part of the new strategy conceived by the lbt observatory ( lbto ) to optimize the science operations of the lbt telescope in the near future @xcite .",
    "the alta project commissioning is articulated in different phases .",
    "we intend here with the term ` commissioning ' the validation of model forecasts or , equivalently , the estimate of the model performances in predicting specific parameters .",
    "results contained in this paper are basically a certification of how good or bad are the model performances with respect to the atmospheric parameters close to the ground .",
    "users and staff responsible for the lbt scheduling can now take advantage of the forecasts of the atmospheric parameters knowing the model performances .",
    "the numerical models used in the alta project to forecast the atmospheric paramaters are the meso - nh @xcite model developed by the centre national des recherches mtorologiques ( cnrm ) and laboratoire darologie ( la ) and the astro - meso - nh module @xcite which is used to provide forecasts of ot parameters .",
    "we limit in the context of this paper to the first one .    among the first studies in using of non - hydrostatic mesoscale models in forecasting atmospheric parameters close to the surface for astronomical applications we highlight ( @xcite ) . at that epoch",
    "it was particularly relevant the employment of sub - kilometric horizontal resolutions in the simulations ( in the context of the astronomical applications ) .",
    "more recently further attempts followed with the same mesoscale model meso - nh @xcite above the antarctic plateau of dome c and with the wrf model @xcite above roque de los muchchos .",
    "more recently , forecasts of atmospheric parameters was part of a large validation campaign conducted within the mose project , commissioned by the european souther observatory ( eso ) and applied to cerro paranal and armazones in chile using the meso - nh model @xcite . in that context",
    "a detailed study has been carried out on the performances of the meso - nh model in forecasting the most important atmospheric parameters close to the ground ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the first time an exhaustive statistical analysis including statistical operators such as the percent of correct detection and the probability of detection in specific ranges of values has been presented putting in evidence excellent model performances ( at our knowledge the best ever achieved in this field ) for basically all the parameters .    in this work",
    "we aim to perform a model validation study of the surface atmospheric parameters calculated on a sample of 144 nights uniformly distributed between 2014 and 2015 .",
    "we intend to use the same strategy used for @xcite but on a different site .",
    "this is the first study on the performances of a non - hydrostatic mesoscale model applied to an astronomical site in which the model is already running in an operational system . besides",
    ", we present a characterization of the surface layer atmospheric parameters above the site of lbt . at our knowledge there are no published results in the literature and this is a fundamental first step for our analysis .",
    "+ in section [ overview ] we give an overview of the lbt site , measurements characteristics , sample selection criteria and model setup .",
    "in section [ char_atm ] we present a synthesis of the climatological analysis of the surface atmospheric parameters : temperature , relative humidity , wind speed and direction . in section [ numana ]",
    "we describe the strategy of the statistical analysis performed in this study . in section [ validation ]",
    "we show the results of the model validation study , in terms of statistical operators and contingency tables . in section [ concl ]",
    "we draw the conclusions and perspectives . +",
    "measurements used as a reference are obtained from the weather stations positioned on two masts placed above the telescope dome and afterwards stored in the telemetry of lbt .",
    "[ fig : example_figure ] shows telescope and the associated weather station instruments .",
    "the lbt dome has a flat roof that is 53  m high above the ground .",
    "the mast labeled `` front '' is positioned on the front side of the dome , facing the telescope line of sight direction .",
    "this mast has only one anemometer measuring wind speed and wind direction , placed at a height of 3  m above the roof ( i.e. 56  m above the ground ) . the second mast labeled `` rear ''",
    "is placed on the rear side of the dome and is equipped with an anemometer , at 5  m height above the roof ( i.e. 58  m above the ground ) , and a set of sensors measuring temperature , relative humidity and pressure , placed at 2.5  m above the roof ( i.e. 55.5  m above the ground ) .",
    "the weather station send data to the telemetry streams approximately each second , which are stored in the lbt archive .",
    "we checked that rear and front anemometer provide the same measure for the wind direction , thus for this specific parameter we used measurements coming from the rear anemometer for the analysis presented in this paper . in the case of the wind speed we detected discrepancies between the two sensors , depending on the direction of the incoming wind .",
    "we could conclude that this was due to the position of the anemometers relative to the lbt roof and we found a method to disentangle the biased measurements and to discard them .",
    "we have been forced therefore to use both front and rear sensors to reconstruct a reliable measure of this parameter . in section [ winddata ]",
    "we discuss the actual procedure for the wind speed measurements selection . +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : wdconsum ]",
    "in this paper we presented the results of the validation study on the operational forecast system being developed for lbt , as part of the alta project , performed on a large 144 nights test sample uniformly distributed over the 2014 - 2015 solar years .",
    "the test was performed on the atmospheric parameters ( temperature , relative humidity , wind speed and direction ) near the ground level using , as a reference term , the telemetry data feed by the weather stations installed on the telescope dome .",
    "we used the meso - nh model with grid - nesting technique and an horizontal resolution of the innermost domain of 500  m and 100  m , the latter being essential in well reconstructing the wind speed in the case of strong winds .",
    "the results obtained in this validation study are extremely good and satisfactory and absolutely comparable to those obtained above paranal and armazones .",
    "different statistical operators have been used ( bias , rmse and @xmath0 ) and more sophisticated operators derived from the computation of the contingency tables i.e. the percent of correct detection ( pc ) , the probability to detect the value of a parameter inside a specific range of values ( pod ) and the probability to have an extremely bad detection .",
    "the validation of the forecasting system refers to the operational configuration of the model used in the alta project .",
    "we summarize here the most relevant results :    1 .",
    "the model has an excellent degree of reliability in reconstructing the temperature , with bias , rmse and @xmath0 below one degree celsius .",
    "we obtained an excellent pc=91.7@xmath7 and all pod@xmath8 are between 84@xmath7 and 99@xmath7 .",
    "the model shows good performances in reconstructing the relative humidity .",
    "we find a very satisfactory bias ( bias=-2.36@xmath7 ) , rmse@xmath914@xmath7 and a @xmath0 = 13.8@xmath7 . besides the pc=71.8@xmath7 is good too .",
    "the most critical pod@xmath8 for the rh is pod@xmath10 that is the probability to detect a rh larger than the second tertile .",
    "we obtained a pod@xmath10 = 61% .",
    "the model correctly discriminate the weak and the strong values of rh .",
    "we would like in the future to improve the dispersion in the every high values of rh but the present result is already more than satisfactory .",
    "the model shows good performances in reconstructing the wind speed with an rmse ranging from 2.4  ms@xmath2 to 2.7  ms@xmath2 , depending on the horizontal resolution ( 500  m or 100  m ) .",
    "we observed that the resolution of 100  m is necessary only when the wind speed is large ( @xmath11 8.5 ms@xmath2 ) otherwise 500  m can provide even better results .",
    "we conceived therefore a hybrid treatment of the model outputs that consider the model outputs from the run having the highest resolution of 500  m when the average of the wind speed of the night is below 8.5 ms@xmath2 and a resolution of 100  m when it is larger than 8.5 ms@xmath2 .",
    "with such a hybrid configuration we obtained a very satisfactory pc@xmath965@xmath7 , pod@xmath12 = 65.7% , pod@xmath13 = 45@xmath7 and pod@xmath10 = 84.8@xmath7 .",
    "we highlight that pod@xmath10 is the most important result for observational applications , being the strong wind case the critical one for telescope operations .",
    "we conclude that model performance is excellent in this respect .",
    "also the results obtained for the wind direction are very satisfactory , with an rmse@xmath14=16.9@xmath7 if we consider all data with wind speeds greater than 3  ms@xmath2 . besides we observed that rmse@xmath14 can arrive to 8.8@xmath7 if we consider all data with wind speed larger than 10  ms@xmath2 .",
    "this means that the higher is the wind speed , the better is the reconstruction of the wind direction by the model .",
    "values of pc and pod@xmath8 improve also passing from a filtering of 3  ms@xmath2 to 10  ms@xmath2 with the best pc=80.5@xmath7 .",
    "pod@xmath8 in all the four quadrants are excellent with values always larger than 72@xmath7 and , when we filter out wind speed lower than 10  ms@xmath2 , model performances achieve percents larger than 90@xmath7 ( see table [ tab : wdconsum ] ) .",
    "in particular , the pod@xmath15 related to the most interesting quadrant from which the wind comes more frequently ( south - west ) is an excellent 85.5@xmath7 .",
    "next step of our investigation for the alta center project will be to use the astro - meso - nh model in its most recent version @xcite to forecast the optical turbulence at lbt .",
    "we will take advantage of measurements related to an extended site testing campaign @xcite providing a vertical stratification of the optical turbulence on the whole 20 km above the ground in which a new technique for high - vertical resolution close to the ground @xcite was employed .",
    "a study @xcite done with a previous version of the astro - meso - nh model , has already shown promising perspectives in that context .",
    "the astro - meso - nh as well as the strategy evolved since there .",
    "the model requires therefore to re - clibrated and re - validated in this perspective .",
    "alta center project is funded by the large binocular telescope corporation .",
    "measurements of surface parameters are provided by the lbt telemetry and annexed instrumentation .",
    "the authors thanks christian veillet , director of the large binocular telescope , for his continued and valuable support given to this research activity .",
    "authors also thanks the lbto staff for their technical support and collaboration .",
    "part of the numerical simulations have been run on the hpcf cluster of the european center for medium range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) using resources from the project spitfot .",
