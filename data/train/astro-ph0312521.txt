    "luminous quasars are rare phenomena in the universe . when the density of luminous quasars reaches a maximum at @xmath6 , its comoving density is about @xmath7 times the density of galaxies ( e.g. , schmidt , schneider & gunn 1995 ) .",
    "high - redshift quasars are often used as signposts to search for accompanying galaxies , as one expects a rich environment around quasars ( e.g. , hall & green 1998 ; djorgovski 1998 ; 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "pairs of quasars may be taken as particularly promising markers of high - density regions , since the probability that two quasars exist in a small volume is very small , unless they are embedded in a special environment such as rich clusters or protoclusters of galaxies .",
    "therefore , the search for physical pairs of quasars , especially at high redshifts , is particularly interesting from the point of view that they may permit exploration of an unusually rich environment in the early universe . taking advantage of wide - field multicolour ccd imaging of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , schneider et al .",
    "( 2000 ) discovered a pair of luminous quasars at @xmath1 separated by @xmath8 in their follow - up spectroscopy at the hobby - eberly telescope . in this paper",
    "the two quasars will be designated as sdss j1439@xmath20034 a , b , with a being the brighter component .",
    "spectroscopic features indicated that this pair is most likely to be a physical association , not a gravitational lens , although the spectra were of limited s / n . the projected distance is @xmath9 mpc with a non - zero lambda ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) cosmology .",
    "this system s separation is among the smallest known at high redshifts .",
    "no comparable high - redshift quasar pairs have been found among the 16,713 quasars in the 1360 deg@xmath12 given in the sdss first data release ( schneider et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the widely - accepted model of galaxy formation based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominance suggests that luminous quasars may be embedded in rich environment ( martini & weinberg 2001 ; haiman & hui 2001 ) . in cdm models ,",
    "quasars are usually ascribed to a phenomenon associated with very rare , high peaks of gaussian fluctuations ( efstathiou & rees 1988 ) .",
    "such fluctuations preferentially reside in the region where one expects rich clusters as the universe evolve .",
    "this is particularly true if the lifetime of individual quasars is long , and only very rare peaks are associated with luminous quasars .    with the anticipation that the environment of two luminous quasars would be particularly rich ,",
    "we investigate the distribution of galaxies around the sdss quasar pair to determine whether this system is embedded in a rich protocluster of galaxies .",
    "we have carried out deep @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 imaging and semi - narrow band imaging with the @xmath16642 filter , which was available at the observatory , for the @xmath17 field around the sdss quasar pair using the subaru telescope at mauna kea .",
    "our prime purpose is to study the spatial distribution of galaxies that show lyman break features ( steidel , pettini & hamilton 1995 ) in the @xmath13 passband ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ) , which indicate @xmath18 , and those that show lyman @xmath5 emission around the same redshift .",
    "additional high - quality spectroscopic observation was made to study whether the two quasars are lensed images or are two distinct objects that have the same redshift .",
    "an important issue to decide is whether the quasars are two gravitationally lensed images of the same source or two physical distinct objects .",
    "schneider et al .",
    "( 2000 ) concluded that the large separation ( 33@xmath3 ) and the apparent differences in the spectra strongly suggested that this is a pair of quasars and not a gravitational lens .",
    "given the limited s /",
    "n of the spectra , however , this conclusion can only be regarded as tentative .    to improve upon the spectra obtained by schneider et al .",
    "( 2000 ) spectroscopic observations of the quasar pair were made on 20 june 2001 using focas at the subaru telescope ( kashikawa et al .",
    "the instrument configuration was a @xmath19 long - slit , a 300 line mm@xmath20 grism blazed at 5500  ( b300 grism ) , and an sy 47 blocking filter .",
    "the 3600 sec exposure was made with the slit rotated to include the two quasars .",
    "focas ccd detectors produce an image scale of @xmath21 pixel@xmath20 and a dispersion of 1.40   pixel@xmath20 .",
    "the pixels are binned 3@xmath222 ( spatial@xmath22spectral ) during readout .",
    "the spectrum covered 4700    to 9400    at a resolution of approximately @xmath23 .",
    "observing conditions were reasonable , although some cirrus was recognized ; the seeing was @xmath24 fwhm .",
    "the spectrophotometric calibration was made with bd+28@xmath254211 .",
    "absolute spectrophotometry was obtained by adjusting the scale to the broad band @xmath14 magnitude for each quasar .    the subaru spectra of sdss j1439 - 0034 a",
    ", b are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "both spectra show the standard features of high - redshift quasars : a significant ly @xmath5 forest , a strong , highly absorbed ly @xmath5 emission line , prominent c iv emission line , and other weaker features .",
    "the redshifts of the quasars , as measured from a weighted value of the emission lines other than lyman @xmath5 , are 4.228 @xmath26 0.005 ( a ) and 4.243 @xmath26 0.009 ( b ) .",
    "the redshifts are marginally consistent with a single value .",
    "the velocity difference is 860 km s@xmath20 , with an uncertainty of comparable size .",
    "the spectra show a number of striking differences , in particular in the strength of the c iv line ( the equivalent width in b is nearly twice that in a ) , and the presence of a strong",
    "n v / o i / si ii / c iv associated absorption system in the spectrum of b. the redshift of the absorption system , 4.249 @xmath26 0.002 , is slightly larger ( 340 km s@xmath20 ) than the emission line redshift of b ; this is consistent with the appearance of the c iv line profile .",
    "we conclude that all of the available data support the interpretation of sdss j1439 - 0034 a , b as a physical pair separated by several hundred kpc .",
    "the imaging observation was made on 19 and 20 june , 2001 also using focas at the subaru telescope .",
    "the circular field of view has a radius of @xmath27 , and the image scale is @xmath28 pixel@xmath20 on two 2k@xmath224k ccd .",
    "a small fraction of the field is obscured by the autoguider .",
    "the conditions were photometric , when the vri photometry was acquired on the first night , but light cirrus was present on the second night when the narrow band imaging was obtained .",
    "the image quality was approximately @xmath29 fwhm for both nights . the total exposure times were 6000s , 3600s , 2340s for @xmath13(5500 ) , @xmath14(6600 ) and @xmath15(8050 ) , and 3600s for @xmath16642 , whose pass band extends from 6364 to 6492  .",
    "data were processed using a standard iraf photometry package , and objects were identified with sextractor version 2.2.1 .",
    "the objects are catalogued if they meet a 2@xmath30 threshold after gaussian smoothing with the width of @xmath31 pixels in the @xmath14 band frame .",
    "this detection threshold corresponds to @xmath32 , or roughly @xmath33 .",
    "( all magnitudes reported in this paper are on the ab magnitude scale , and throughout the rest of this paper we will drop the ab subscript . ) the characteristic magnitude of @xmath18 lyman break galaxies is @xmath34 derived by steidel et al .",
    "our depth with focas is shallower by about 1 mag than that of ouchi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who studied @xmath18 galaxies using the prime focus imager of the subaru telescope ; our observations , however , are sufficiently deep to detect significant numbers of bright galaxies at @xmath18 , as our simulation ( described later ) indicates .",
    "the photometric zero points determined from standard stars agree with those of sdss photometry to within 0.1 mag after the colour transformation .",
    "the focas field that contains quasars will be referred to as field q. the basic properties of the quasars are listed in table 1 .",
    "extra @xmath35 imaging observations were made with slightly shorter exposure times for a ` blank ' field centred at @xmath3624@xmath3736@xmath38 and @xmath3904@xmath4030@xmath3 ; field b ) ; this will be designated as field b. note that the focas field is sufficiently wide that the majority of field q can also be used as a background field .",
    "the blank field increases statistics of background galaxies .",
    "the catalogue contains 1181 objects fainter than @xmath41 in field q ( effective area after excising the masked area for bright stars and a satellite track is 21.6 sq .",
    "arcmin ) , and 954 objects in field b ( 21.6 sq .",
    "we apply the @xmath13 dropout technique to select candidates of @xmath42 galaxies .",
    "we use the population synthesis model of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) to calculate the evolution tracks in colour space , but we have checked that the tracks of gissel95 ( see , bruzual & charlot 1993 ) differ little for the redshift of interest here .",
    "the effects of ly @xmath5 absorbers are incorporated according to madau ( 1995 ) ( see also steidel et al .",
    "a variety of star formation histories is adopted to calculate the location for @xmath18 galaxies with internal reddening varying from @xmath43 to 0.3 , and the region in @xmath44 vs @xmath45 space is optimised using a monte carlo simulation which we describe in what follows .",
    "the condition we adopt to select galaxies centred at @xmath46 galaxies is @xmath47 this colour - colour region ( delineated with the dashed line ) and typical evolution tracks are shown in figure 2 , together with the galaxies we detected on one of the 2k@xmath224k ccd exposed for field q ( we omitted data points which have large photometric errors , @xmath48 mag in the i band : largely scattered data points in the @xmath49 region are mostly ascribed to poor photometry in the @xmath15 band ) .",
    "the tracks cover the range from a short , single burst ( @xmath50 gyr ) to continuous star formation to explore wide star formation histories and a range of @xmath51 specified above .",
    "the formation redshift is assumed to be @xmath52 , but tracks with lower formation redshift pass through the same region in colour space .    with condition ( [ eq : colcond ] )",
    "we obtain 26 galaxies in field q and 18 in field b. those galaxies that satisfy ( [ eq : colcond ] ) in field q are plotted by large circles , together with all others with @xmath53 which are denoted by dots , in figure 3 .    a monte carlo simulation is carried out using the colour , magnitude and redshift distribution of galaxies in hdf - n ( fernndez - soto , lanzetta & yahil 1999 ) to find the selection criterion , and to estimate the contamination and completeness of the sample , as was done in ouchi et al .",
    "figure 4 presents an example of monte carlo simulation , showing the redshift distribution of the galaxies selected with ( [ eq : colcond ] ) . taking our window to be in the range @xmath54 , the contamination from low redshift objects and those just below or above the window is 60% for @xmath55 .",
    "almost all objects with @xmath56 are of low redshifts .",
    "the completeness is about 75 % for @xmath57 , but drops to 60% for @xmath58 .",
    "it is already clear in figure 3 that there is no recognizable clustering of galaxies around the quasar pair . to make this statement more precise , we show in figure 5 number counts of galaxies in the @xmath15 band for those in a circular region ( indicated in figure 4 ) of the radius @xmath59 ( physical distance : 0.61 mpc for @xmath60 ) from the centre of the quasar pair , and those in other parts of field q plus field b. the choice of a @xmath59 radius , which was rather arbitrary , was made to maximize the number of galaxies encircled to derive a conservative limit on the surface density of galaxies around the quasars .",
    "the area for the quasar field is 5.8 sq .",
    "arcmin , and that of the background totals 37.3 sq .",
    "we applied the above - mentioned corrections for incompleteness and contamination .",
    "the dotted triangles are number counts for @xmath61 galaxies obtained by ouchi et al .",
    "( which agree with those of steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) from their survey of a much wider field .",
    "the number counts in both regions agree for all magnitudes brighter than @xmath62 , and with ouchi et al .",
    "counts for @xmath63 .",
    "the latter disagreement beyond @xmath64 indicates incompleteness of our catalogue , but this completeness is not important for our purpose .",
    "this figure confirms that there is no enhancement of galaxies with the luminosity @xmath65 in the vicinity of the quasar pair . from poisson statistics we derive an upper limit of the density enhancement around the quasars to be @xmath66 at the 90% confidence level for the 90@xmath3 circular region .",
    "note that this calculation includes two quasars as bright galaxies .",
    "our final discussion concerns @xmath16642 semi - narrow band imaging .",
    "the passband of the filter covers ly @xmath5 emission for @xmath67 , but the band width is not narrow enough for sensitive search for ly emission .",
    "so , we adopt a rather weak criterion that @xmath68 to select ` @xmath16 bright ' galaxies . among the high @xmath69 galaxy candidates that meet ( [ eq : colcond ] )",
    "those that satisfy this criterion are shown by solid circles in figure 3 above .",
    "the distribution of these ` @xmath16 bright ' galaxies are scattered , no clustering is seen around quasars .",
    "incidentally , we have confirmed by removing the @xmath70 mag condition that there is no quasars in field q which fall in this redshift range other than the two that are already known .",
    "we have shown that the field in the vicinity of the quasar pair sdss j1439@xmath20034 at @xmath71 hardly differs from the general filed regarding the surface density of bright galaxies at around @xmath18 .",
    "a density enhancement , if present , is no more than three times the field density at a 90% confidence .",
    "we consider that this is rather unexpected .",
    "although this is but one example ( though the pair of quasars make it a particularly attractive one ) , our null results suggest that luminous quasars are not always signposts for high - density regions . this is perhaps an example of a case where two normal galaxies happened by chance to simultaneously display the quasar phenomenon .",
    "the scarcity of luminous , high redshift quasars is not solely ( or even primarily ) due to the requirement that they reside in the rare , high density perturbations ; a relatively short lifetime of the quasar phenomenon at high redshift could play an important role .",
    "we would like to thank youichi ohyama for his very efficient help for our observation at the subaru telescope .",
