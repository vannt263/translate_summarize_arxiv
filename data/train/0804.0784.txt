    "despite the fact that graphite oxide ( go ) was first derived more than a century ago@xmath0 its structure and chemical composition remains not quite clear yet .",
    "go can be used for production of graphite nanoparticles and an insulating material for nanodevices@xmath1 . recently , after discovery of extraordinary electronic properties of single - layer carbon , graphene@xmath2 , and successful exfoliation of layers in go@xmath3 it is considered as a perspective source of a `` cheap graphene''@xmath4 .",
    "direct structural information about go can be hardly obtained ( for the most of structural methods the use of bulk crystals are desirable whereas the go exists mainly in solutions ) which makes especially important theoretical modeling of its structure and properties .",
    "original methods of preparation of go have been modified afterwards@xmath5 which allows to vary a bit its chemical composition . in nakajima and matsuo",
    "paper@xmath6 the chemical compositions of go derived by the methods developed by brodie@xmath7 and staudenmaier@xmath8 were determined as c@xmath9h@xmath10o@xmath11 and c@xmath9h@xmath12o@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "this means that both hydroxyl groups connected with single carbon atoms and oxygen atoms connected with two carbon atoms present in go ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . according to szab and co - workers@xmath14",
    ", the chemical composition of different samples of go varies from c@xmath9h@xmath15o@xmath16 to c@xmath9h@xmath17o@xmath18 , according to hontora - lucas et al .",
    "paper@xmath19 - from c@xmath9(oh)@xmath20o@xmath21 to c@xmath9(oh)@xmath22o@xmath23 , and , according to cassagneau and co - workers@xmath24 - from c@xmath25ho@xmath26 to c@xmath27h@xmath28o@xmath29 . in general",
    ", one can conclude that the chemical composition of go , not considering groups coupled with graphene edges , varies in a range from c@xmath9h@xmath26o@xmath28 to c@xmath9h@xmath29o@xmath30 .",
    "it is a common opinion ( see the papers cited above ) that oxygen in go mainly presents in hydroxyl groups or in bridges connecting two carbon atoms in graphene layers whereas the amount of carboxyl , as well as carbonyl , groups is relatively small .",
    "thus , the two limiting compositions of go can be presented as c@xmath9(oh)@xmath26 and c@xmath9(oh)@xmath29o .",
    "all chemical formulas of go obtained experimentally manifest the coverage of graphene between 25% and 75% , which means that , at least , quarter of carbon - carbon bonds in graphene layer are double bonds whereas the rest is single bonds like in diamond .",
    "indeed , both xps@xmath31 and infrared@xmath32 spectroscopy data confirm coexistence of @xmath33 and @xmath34 electron configurations of carbon .    based on experimental data@xmath6 and additional measurement results , a model of go",
    "has been suggested by nakajima and co - workers@xmath35 . according to this model , the go structure is intermediate between two ideal structures , c@xmath9o@xmath36 and c@xmath9(oh)@xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c and h respectively ) .",
    "later models@xmath38 differ mainly by assumptions concerning edge groups . as a result",
    ", the go structure is described as a combination of completely covered and completely uncovered stripes of graphene which is confirmed also by recent theoretical results@xmath39 .",
    "recently , mechanical properties of go have been simulated , based on modeling of nanoobjects functionalized by oxygen from one side@xmath40 or on experimental data on chemical composition of go@xmath41 .",
    "however , due to the stripes of uncovered graphene , go should be conducting , according to these models .",
    "at the same time , experimentally go becomes conducting only after a very strong reduction@xmath42 whereas typically go is insulating .",
    "here , based on density functional calculations , we formulate a model of insulating go .",
    "we investigate also a transition to conducting state at the reduction and explain why it is so difficult to clean go completely and to derive pure graphene from go .",
    "some general factors determining chemical functionalization of graphene have been investigated in our previous work@xmath43 using hydrogenization as an example .",
    "first , graphene is a very flexible material , and a chemisorption of even single hydrogen atom leads to essential distortions of the graphene sheet with a radius approximately 5  , and these lattice distortions are of crucial importance for energetics of the process .",
    "second , for the chemisorption of two hydrogen atoms the configuration where they are bonded with two neighboring carbon atoms from opposite sides of the sheet turns out to be the most energetically favorable .",
    "third , complete coverage by hydrogen provides the global minimum of energy .",
    "these features are relevant , as we will show here , also for the case of go .",
    "we used the pseudopotential density functional siesta package for electronic structure calculations@xmath44 with the generalized gradient approximation for the density functional@xmath45 , with energy mesh cutoff 400 ry , and @xmath46-point 11@xmath4711@xmath471 mesh in monkhorst - park scheme@xmath48 . during the optimization",
    ", the electronic ground states was found self - consistently by using norm - conserving pseudopotentials to cores and a double-@xmath49 plus polarization basis of localized orbitals for carbon and oxygen , and double-@xmath49 one for hydrogen .",
    "optimization of the bond lengths and total energies was performed with an accuracy 0.04 ev /  and 1 mev , respectively .",
    "this method is frequently used for computations of electronic structure of graphene@xmath50 .    to compute the properties of layered",
    "go we have carried out calculations of the corresponding structures for the case of 25% coverage by hydroxyl groups . instead of gga ,",
    "we use here the lda approximation which is known to be more accurate to describe interlayer coupling in graphite and other van der waals systems@xmath51 . the basis for carbon atoms",
    "was optimized as proposed earlier for pure graphite@xmath52 .",
    "chemisorption energies were calculated by standard formulas used , e.g. , earlier for the case of chemisorption of hydrogen on graphene@xmath43 and solution of carbon in @xmath53-iron@xmath54 .",
    "thus , energy of chemisorption of single oxygen atom at eight carbon atoms ( fig .",
    "2a ) is calculated as e@xmath55=e@xmath56-e@xmath57-e@xmath58/2 where e@xmath56 is the total energy of the supercell found by self - consistent calculations after optimization of geometric structure , e@xmath57 is the total energy of graphene supercell , and e@xmath58 is the energy of oxygen molecule . for the case of hydroxyl group , instead of oxygen",
    ", its energy was calculated with respect to water in gaseous phase : e@xmath59=e@xmath60-e@xmath61/2 .",
    "alternatively , the chemisorption energy can be calculated as e@xmath59=e@xmath62/2+e@xmath58/4 .",
    "these two expressions estimate the chemisorption energy from above and from below ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3]b where the results corresponding to the first and to the second expression are shown by dashed green and dotted blue , respectively ) . to be specific , in further discussions",
    "we will use the first estimation ( the dashed green line ) . actually , the chemisorption energy for go containing both oxygen and hydroxyl groups depend on its chemical composition .",
    "for example , the chemisorption energy of oxygen and oh group in the system c@xmath9(oh)@xmath37o are e@xmath63 = e@xmath64 + e@xmath58/2 - e@xmath65 and e@xmath63 = ( e@xmath66 + 2e@xmath59 - e@xmath65)/2 , respectively .    to check an accuracy of the method used we have calculated formation energy of the water from molecular oxygen and hydrogen in gaseous phase .",
    "we have found the value 213.4 kj / mol which is rather close to the experimental value 241.8 kj / mol .",
    "underestimation of the energy by approximately 10% is typical for gga calculations@xmath54 .",
    "also , we have calculated equilibrium interatomic distances for graphene , molecular oxygen , hydrogen , and water , as well as interlayer distances in graphene . when drawing the pictures of density of states , a smearing by 0.3 ev was used .",
    "we start our simulations with the case of oxygen chemisorption , then consider the chemisorption of hydroxyl groups and , at last , investigate their various combinations .",
    "let us consider first a supercell of graphene containing 8 carbon atoms , the chemisorption of two of them corresponding 25% coverage .",
    "in contrast with hydrogen , oxygen forms a bridge between two carbon atoms , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a . as well as for the case of hydrogen , the chemisorption leads to distortions of graphene sheets when the atoms coupled to oxygen are shifted up and their neighbors are moved in the opposite direction .",
    "this makes chemisorption of the next oxygen atom from the opposite side of graphene sheet the most energetically profitable ( fig . [",
    "various oxygen configurations for various coverage are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a - e and the computational results for carbon - carbon distances , chemisorption energies , and electron energy gaps are presented in fig .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig3]a that the length of bonds between functionalized carbon atoms grows from the standard value for graphene , 1.42  , to the standard value for diamond , 1.54  , at the coverage increase which corresponds to the transition from @xmath34 to @xmath33 hybridization of carbon atoms .",
    "the chemisorption energy increases in absolute value with the coverage increase and the most stable is the configuration displayed in fig .",
    "the gap in electron energy spectrum opens starting form 75% coverage where its value is 1.8 ev ; with the coverage increase , it grows up to 2.9 ev .",
    "hydroxyl groups are bonded with graphene similar to hydrogen@xmath43 , that is , they sit at neighboring carbon atoms from opposite sides of the graphene sheet ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "distortions of the sheet is stronger in this case than in the case of hydrogen , partially , due to interaction between the hydroxyl groups leading to ordering of distortion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , c ) .",
    "various calculated configurations are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig2]f - g .",
    "the chemisorption energy was calculated with respect to water which is probably the most informative to consider reduction of go . with the coverage increase , the carbon - carbon distance growth , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a . for the case of complete coverage",
    "it turns out to be larger than a standard one for a single bond ( @xmath33 hybridization ) which means a situation close to break of the graphene sheet .",
    "in contrast with the cases of hydrogen and oxygen , the chemisorption energy is not monotonous as a function of coverage reaching the minimum at 75% which should correspond , therefore , to the most optimal configuration ( fig . [",
    "fig1]b ) .",
    "let us consider now a general case of functionalization of graphene by both hydroxyl groups and oxygen atoms .",
    "typical combinations are shown in fig .",
    "total energy calculations demonstrate that for all the combinations under consideration the chemisorption energy per hydroxyl group is 60 mev lower , and per oxygen atom 30 mev lower than for the pure cases with the same degrees of coverage .",
    "thus , mixed coverage is energetically favorable in these cases ( coverage between 25% and 75% ) diminishing the energy of both o and oh groups . for coverage less than 25%",
    "the chemisorption energy for hydroxyl groups turns out to be lower than for oxygen , therefore one can conclude that go with 25% coverage contains only oh groups whereas some oxygen atoms can appear only as edge groups .",
    "optimal configurations for 25% , 50% , and 100% coverage are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4]a , e and c , and h , respectively .",
    "one should stress that a structure with staggered stripes of @xmath34 and @xmath33 carbon atoms is formed at 50% , in agreement with the previous works@xmath39 . for the maximal coverage , as well as for the case of oh groups only",
    ", carbon - carbon distances exceed 1.54   which makes , again , 100% coverage less favorable than 75% one .",
    "the most stable configuration of go is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c .    as a result",
    ", one can suggest the following chemical formulas for go with various coverage : 25% - c@xmath9(oh)@xmath36 , 50% - c@xmath9(oh)@xmath36o , and 75% - c@xmath9(oh)@xmath37o .",
    "they are rather close to the formulas suggested by experimentalists and discussed in the introduction .",
    "minor discrepancies can be related with the presence of some small amount of carboxyl and carbonyl groups , as well as atomic oxygen adsorbed at the edges of go , as was discussed in detail within the model proposed by lerf et al@xmath38 .",
    "electron densities of states for go are presented in fig .",
    "one can see that the energy gap varies between 2.8 ev and 1.8 ev at the decrease of coverage from 75% to 50% . at further reduction of",
    "go it becomes conducting , according to our calculations .",
    "it seems to be in agreement with the available experimental data@xmath67 .",
    "the chemisorption energy difference per group for 25% and 75% coverage is less than 1 ev ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) which explains a possibility of partial reduction of go , both thermally and chemically . actually , the carbon to oxygen ratio 4:1 considered above is a bit larger than experimental values for strongly reduced go@xmath68 and almost twice larger than the maximal ratio 10:1@xmath69 . to study dependence of the chemisorption energy on the c : o ratio we have performed calculations for the cases of two hydroxyl groups ( see fig . [ fig2]f ) per supercells containing 8 , 18 , 32 , 50 , and 72 carbon atoms , the latter case corresponding to the c : o ratio 32:1 . the computational results are presented in fig .",
    "one can see that the chemisorption energy is weakly concentration - dependent between the ratio values 4:1 and 16:1 whereas for smaller concentrations of hydroxyl groups it decreases roughly twice , between 16:1 and 25:1 .",
    "a weakening of chemical bonding between oh groups and graphene at small concentrations ( c : o ratio from 25:1 in comparison with 16:1 ) is connected with essential changes of the electronic structure . at very small concentrations ,",
    "the latter is more similar to that of pure graphene ( see fig . [ fig6]b ) .",
    "it can be caused by the changes of distances between oh groups which is 17   for the carbon - to - oxygen ratio 16:1 .",
    "it was shown at the simulation of hydrogenization of graphene@xmath43 that typical radius of interaction between the hydrogen atoms is about 8  , and the defects can be considered as independent ones for larger distances . for the case of oh groups ,",
    "the distortions of graphene sheet is larger than for the case of hydrogen and therefore interaction between them is still essential for the ration 16:1 whereas for smaller concentrations the hydroxyl groups can be considered as almost non - interacting . in real experimental situation where the ratio 10:1 has been reached@xmath69 finite - size effects of the go flakes can be important .",
    "indeed , the size of these flakes is smaller than for the case of graphene@xmath70 and various groups can be chemisorbed at the edges .",
    "also , the flakes can contain various topological defects@xmath71 which can also change local chemisorption energy .    at last ,",
    "let us discuss the cases of bilayer and periodic ( graphite - like ) go . to this aim",
    "we have carried out calculations for corresponding structures with 25% coverage by hydroxyl groups .",
    "we consider the bernal ( ab ) stacking , similar to pure graphite , which was observed also in go@xmath72 . the optimized structure is shown in fig . [ fig7 ] .",
    "the width of the layer was found to be , in both cases , about 7  , as well as interlayer distances , which seems to be in a good agreement with experimental data@xmath73 .",
    "to calculate interlayer coupling energy per carbon atom we have computed the energy differences between single layer and periodic structure . for the case of pure graphite",
    ", it equals 32 mev , in a good agreement with the experimental value 35 mev@xmath74 . for the periodic go structure and for go bilayer , the corresponding values turn out to be 17 mev and 6 mev , respectively .",
    "this decrease of the energy explains possibility of easy exfoliation in go@xmath3 .",
    "due to weakness of interlayer coupling , the electronic structure of go is almost identical for single layer , bilayer , and periodic structure , in contrast with the cases of pure graphene@xmath75 .",
    "to summarize , we have proposed a model structure of go which seems to be consistent with all known experimental data .",
    "we have demonstrated , in particular , that ( i ) 100% coverage of go is less energetically favorable than 75% ( ii ) functionalization by both oxygen and hydroxyl groups is more favorable for coverage than 25% than by hydroxyl groups only ( iii ) a reduction of go from 75% to 6.25% ( c : o ratio 16:1 ) coverage is relatively easy but further reduction seems to be rather difficult , and ( iv ) go becomes conducting at the coverage 25% , being an insulator for larger coverage .      *",
