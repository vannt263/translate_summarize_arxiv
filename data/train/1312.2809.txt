    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for comprehensive monographs on such random variables . from their definition ,",
    "ggc random variables are self - decomposable ( sd ) hence infinitely divisible ( i d ) , absolutely continuous and unimodal  see , for example , @xcite for the proofs of the latter properties .",
    "we also see from ( [ grege ] ) that ggc random variables are characterized up to translation by the positive radon measure on @xmath7 uniquely associated to the cm function @xmath5 by bernstein s theorem , which is called the thorin measure of @xmath2 and whose total mass , @xmath8 might be infinite . as an illustration of this characterization , theorem 4.1.4 in @xcite shows that the density of @xmath2 vanishes in @xmath9 if @xmath10 whereas it is infinite in @xmath9 if @xmath11 we refer to @xcite for a recent survey on ggc variables having a finite thorin measure , dealing in particular with their wiener  gamma representations and their relations with dirichlet processes .",

    "hcm densities turn out to be characterized as pointwise limits of densities of the form @xmath20 where all above parameters are positive  see sections 5.2 and 5.3 in @xcite .",
    "this characterization yields many explicit examples of ggc random variables , since it is also true that hcm random variables are ggc ",
    "see theorem 5.2.1 in @xcite . actually , hcm variables appear as a kind of center for ggc in view of theorem 6.2.1 in @xcite which states that the independent product or quotient of a ggc by a hcm variable is still a ggc .",
    "the hcm class is also stable by independent multiplication and power transformations of absolute value greater than one .",

    "similarly as above , one can extend the hm property to all positive functions on @xmath6 obviously , hcm is a subclass of hm .",
    "it is easy to see ",
    "see @xcite , pages 101102  that @xmath2 is hm iff its density @xmath12 is such that @xmath21 is log - concave on @xmath22 .",
    "this shows that @xmath12 is a.e .",
    "differentiable with @xmath23 a nonincreasing function , so that @xmath24 has at most one change of sign and @xmath2 is unimodal .",
    "the main theorem in @xcite shows that hm variables are actually multiplicatively strong unimodal , viz .",
    "their independent product with any unimodal random variable is unimodal . from the log - concavity characterization ,",
    "the hm property is stable by power transformation of any value , and this entails that the inclusion hcm @xmath25 hm is strict : if @xmath26 then @xmath27 is hm but not i d , hence not hcm . from prkopa",
    "s theorem , the hm property is also stable by independent multiplication.=1    for a positive random variable with density , the standard way to derive the ggc property is to read it from the laplace transform .",
    "for example , it is straightforward to see that positive @xmath0-stable variables are all ggc  see example 3.2.1 in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is easier to study the hcm property from features on the density itself and laplace transforms are barely helpful . as an illustration of this , we show without much effort in section  [ s4 ] of the present paper that the quotient of two positive @xmath0-stable variables , whose density is explicit , is hcm iff @xmath1 problems become usually more intricate when one searches for ggc without explicit laplace transform or for hcm without closed expression for the density.=1    in 1981 , bondesson raised the conjecture that positive @xmath0-stable variables should be hcm iff @xmath28 and this very hard problem ( quoting his own recent words , see remark  3 in  @xcite ) is still unsolved except in the easy case when @xmath0 is the reciprocal of an integer  see example 5.6.2 in @xcite .",

    "this family is actually a bit larger than the one which would be obtained from the validity of bondesson s hypothesis .",
    "the more difficult case @xmath35 $ ] is also studied , with a partial result . in section  [ s3 ] ,",
    "we use kanter s and pestana  shanbhag ",
    "sreehari s factorizations to show that a large class of positive powers of @xmath0-stable variables is the product of an hcm variable and an i d variable .",
    "the latter turns out to be always a mixture of exponentials ( me ) , hence very close to a ggc .",
    "along the way , we also obtain an independent proof of pestana  shanbhag ",
    "sreehari s factorization . in section  [ s4 ]",
    ", we show the aforementioned hcm result for the quotient of two stable variables , and a similar characterization for mittag  leffler variables . not surprisingly , both yield the same boundary parameter @xmath36    the results presented in sections [ s2 ] and [ s3 ] are probably not optimal and at the end of section  [ s3 ] we state another conjecture , where the power exponent @xmath37 appears naturally .",
    "we also hope that the different tools and methods presented here will be helpful to tackle bondesson s conjecture more deeply , even though we have tried to exploit them to their full extent",
    ".      we will consider real random variables @xmath2 having a density always denoted by @xmath38 , unless explicitly stated . for the sake of brevity , we will use slightly incorrect expressions like `` ggc variable '' or `` hcm variable '' and sometimes even delete the word `` variable '' ( as was actually already done in the present introduction ) .",
