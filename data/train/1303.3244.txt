    "<S> diffusion has been widely used to describe a random walk of particles or waves , and it requires only one parameter  the diffusion constant . for waves , </S>",
    "<S> however , diffusion is an approximation that disregards the possibility of interference@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> anderson localization@xcite , which manifests itself through a vanishing diffusion coefficient in an infinite system@xcite , originates from constructive interference of waves traveling in loop trajectories  pairs of time - reversed paths returning to the same point@xcite . in an open system of finite size </S>",
    "<S> , the return probability through such paths is reduced , particularly near the boundary where waves may escape . based on this argument , the self - consistent theory of localization and the supersymmetric field theory predict@xcite that the diffusion coefficient varies spatially inside the system . </S>",
    "<S> a direct experimental observation of this effect is a challenge because it requires monitoring wave transport inside the system . here </S>",
    "<S> , we fabricate two - dimensional photonic random media and probe position - dependent diffusion inside the sample from the third dimension . by varying the geometry of the system or the dissipation which also limits the size of loop trajectories , we are able to control the renormalization of the diffusion coefficient . </S>",

    "<S> the concept of diffusion has since been used to describe transport phenomena in both physics and other sciences . </S>",
    "<S> the power of this approach is that it requires knowledge of a single parameter , the diffusion constant , regardless of the underlying microscopical mechanisms of transport . </S>",
    "<S> if the spatial gradient of particle density is not too large , the particle flux is linearly proportional to the gradient , and the coefficient is the diffusion constant . </S>",
    "<S> diffusion is also applicable to waves@xcite , but it ignores interference effects . </S>",
    "<S> when inelastic scattering is negligible , most of the elastically scattered waves have uncorrelated phases and their interference is averaged out . nevertheless , a wave may return to a position it has previously visited after a random walk , and there is always the time - reversed path which yields identical phase delay . </S>",
    "<S> constructive interference of the waves from the reversed loops increases wave ( energy ) density at the original position and decreases the flux , giving the so - called weak localization effect@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the basic mechanism for the suppression of wave diffusion , which eventually leads to anderson localization@xcite .    in the self - consistent theory of localization , </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 is renormalized , and the amount of renormalization is proportional to the return probability of waves via the looped paths@xcite . in an open system of finite size , the return probability is reduced because the longer loops may reach the boundary where waves escape . </S>",
    "<S> thus the renormalization of @xmath0 depends on the system size . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , near the boundary the chance of escape is higher , so the renormalization of @xmath0 is weaker . </S>",
    "<S> this means the value of @xmath0 is no longer constant but varies spatially@xcite . in the presence of dissipation </S>",
    "<S> the long loops are also cut , thus the renormalization of the diffusion coefficient depends on the amount of dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> this sets an effective system size beyond which the wave will not return@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although self - consistent theory has successfully interpreted several experiments@xcite , its key prediction of position - dependent diffusion has not been observed directly because it is difficult to probe wave transport inside the system experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> here we report direct experimental evidence of position - dependent diffusion by probing light transport inside a quasi - two - dimensional random system from the third dimension . the system size and shape </S>",
    "<S> are designed to make the return probability sufficiently high so that the diffusion coefficient is modified appreciably . </S>",
    "<S> we also use dissipation to control the effective system size , and tune the value of @xmath0 via the interplay of localization and dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> this work demonstrates the possibility of utilizing the geometry of a random system or the dissipation to manipulate wave diffusion .    </S>",
    "<S> we designed and fabricated two - dimensional ( 2d ) disordered waveguide structures in a 220  nm silicon layer on top of 3  @xmath1 m buried oxide . </S>",
    "<S> the patterns were written by electron beam lithography and etched in an inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etcher . as shown in the scanning electron microscope images in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sem ] , the waveguide has sidewalls made of periodic arrays of air holes . </S>",
    "<S> they possess a 2d photonic bandgap that covers the wavelength range of the probe light ( @xmath2 = 1500  nm  </S>",
    "<S> 1520  nm ) , thus providing optical confinement in the plane of the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> light enters the waveguide from an open end and is incident onto a 2d array of air holes inside the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the random pattern of air holes causes light to scatter while going through the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the transport mean free path @xmath3 is determined by the size and density of air holes . </S>",
    "<S> light localization will occur if the length of the random array @xmath4 exceeds the localization length @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of propagating modes in the waveguide , @xmath7 is the waveguide width , @xmath2 is the optical wavelength in vacuum , and @xmath8 is the effective index of refraction of the random medium . since @xmath9 scales linearly with @xmath7 , @xmath10 can be easily tuned by varying the waveguide width . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by changing the waveguide geometry ( @xmath4 , @xmath7 ) , we can reach both the diffusion regime ( @xmath11 ) and localization regime ( @xmath12)@xcite . although there is no mobility edge@xcite in such a system , it is not essential for our goal of observing position - dependent diffusion .    in order to apply the self - consistent theory of localization to the analysis of the experimental data below , we first validate it with numerical simulations under conditions close to those in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we computed the position - dependent diffusion coefficient without making any assumption about the nature or strength of wave interference ( see the methods section ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : simulations ] plots the calculated @xmath13 ( the lower dashed line ) for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the diffusion coefficient without renormalization .. the @xmath16 axis is parallel to the waveguide , and the random array extends from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalized @xmath19 drops to @xmath20 in the middle of the random waveguide ( @xmath21 ) . using the self - consistent theory of localization ( </S>",
    "<S> see the supplementary information ) we calculate @xmath13 ( the lower solid line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : simulations ] ) and it is in excellent agreement with the ab - initio simulation without any fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies show that further into the localization regime where resonant tunneling dominates wave transport , the self - consistent theory of localization underestimates the energy density inside the random system that is strongly affected by the presence of necklace states@xcite . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> we avoid such a regime and stay where the self - consistent theory of localization holds@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another factor we shall consider is the dissipation of light in the random waveguide . within the wavelength range of the probe , light absorption by silicon or silica is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> however , light is scattered out of the waveguide plane by the random array of air holes . </S>",
    "<S> such scattering allows us to monitor the intensity distribution inside the system from the vertical direction . </S>",
    "<S> the question is whether the out - of - plane scattering can be treated as incoherent dissipation . in a periodic array of scatterers , long - range correlation of light fields </S>",
    "<S> makes the waves scattered from different locations phase coherent and their interference in the far field zone determines the out - of - plane leakage . in contrast , in a random array of scatterers , the fields are correlated@xcite only within a distance of the order one transport mean free path @xmath3 , and waves from different coherent regions of size @xmath22 have uncorrelated phases . since there are a large number of such coherence regions @xmath22 in our waveguides @xmath23 , the overall leakage may be considered incoherent and treated effectively as absorption .    </S>",
    "<S> to illustrate the effect of dissipation on position - dependent diffusion , we perform numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusive absorption length in the random system is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the ballistic absorption time . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath26 becomes smaller than the localization length @xmath10 , the effect of dissipation is significant . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : simulations ] plots the calculated @xmath13 in the random waveguide with @xmath27 ( the upper dashed line ) in comparison to that with @xmath28 ( no absorption ) . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of diffusion is weakened by the absorption , and a plateau for the renormalized diffusion coefficient is developed inside the disordered system . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> dissipation suppresses feedback from long propagation paths , limiting the effective size of the system@xcite to the order of diffusive absorption length for any position that is more than one @xmath26 away from the open boundary ( @xmath29)@xcite . thus the renormalized @xmath0 reaches a constant value equal to that of an open system of dimension @xmath30 . in the remaining regions that are within one @xmath26 to the boundary ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , the diffusion coefficient is still position dependent due to leakage through the boundary and @xmath0 increases toward the value of @xmath15 without renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the extent of these regions @xmath26 is much greater than the transport mean free path @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter determines the boundary region where the diffusion approximation is not accurate even without wave interference@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : simulations ] also shows the prediction of self - consistent theory of localization in the presence of dissipation ( the upper solid line ) , and it agrees well with the numerical result .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally there are three advantages to using the planar waveguide geometry . </S>",
    "<S> first , it allows a precise fabrication of the desired system using lithography so that the parameters such as the transport mean free path can be accurately controlled . </S>",
    "<S> second , the localization length @xmath33 can be varied by changing the waveguide width , while the diffusive absorption length @xmath26 remains fixed . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to separate the effects of localization and dissipation by testing waveguides of different width . finally , unlike 2d random systems@xcite , the additional confinement of light by the waveguide sidewalls makes @xmath10 scale linearly with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> even if scattering is relatively weak ( @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the wavenumber ) , the waveguide length @xmath4 can easily exceed @xmath10 so that the localization effect is strong enough to modify diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> instead of designing the disorder to maximize scattering ( minimizing @xmath36 ) , we deliberately lower the density of air holes to mitigate the out - of - plane scattering loss and maximize the ratio @xmath37 .    in the optical measurement , </S>",
    "<S> output from a wavelength - tunable continuous - wave laser ( hp 8168f ) was coupled to the waveguide through a single - mode polarization - maintaining lensed fiber as shown schematically in fig .  </S>",
