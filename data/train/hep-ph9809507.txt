    "the higgs boson is the only not yet discovered particle of the standard model of elementary particle physics . up to now",
    "only lower bounds on its mass of @xmath4  gev  @xcite could be derived from the lack of observation at lep  1 and lep  2 . through the virtual presence of the higgs boson in loop diagrams",
    "it is also possible to set indirect limits on @xmath5 with the help of the precision data collected at lep , slc and tevatron .",
    "currently they read @xmath6  gev with an upper limit of @xmath7  gev at 95  % c.l .  @xcite .",
    "these numbers suggest that a higgs boson in the so - called intermediate - mass range , i.e. @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the @xmath10 boson , is an attractive candidate . in this paper",
    "we will therefore consider such a higgs boson and compute corrections to its gluonic decay rate .",
    "comprehensive reviews concerning the properties of the higgs boson are given in  @xcite .",
    "the dominant decay mode of an intermediate - mass higgs boson is the one into bottom quarks .",
    "the qcd corrections are known up to @xmath11  @xcite . concerning the electroweak theory ,",
    "the full one - loop corrections are available  @xcite . for the mixed electroweak / qcd corrections only the leading terms of order @xmath12  @xcite and @xmath3  @xcite",
    "are evaluated at the two- and three - loop level , respectively .",
    "an other important decay mode is the one into gluons .",
    "however , this process is suppressed as compared to the fermionic channel as at lowest order it is mediated via a quark loop .",
    "it turns out that the leading order qcd corrections are quite large and amount to roughly @xmath13  %  @xcite .",
    "recently also the next - to - leading terms were evaluated which give a further enhancement of roughly @xmath14  % and thus increase the confidence to use perturbative qcd  @xcite . in  @xcite the leading electroweak corrections of order @xmath0 were evaluated . in turned out that cancellations between different contributions take place and the final result is quite small .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to add an extra gluon and to evaluate the three - loop corrections of order @xmath12 , also in order to observe the behaviour of the perturbative series .",
    "thus the aim of this paper is to consider next to qcd corrections also those terms arising from the electroweak theory which are enhanced by the top quark mass and proportional to @xmath0 .    for a higgs boson in the intermediate mass range it makes sense to consider the limit @xmath15 and to construct in a first step an effective lagrangian where the top quark is integrated out .",
    "then the main task for the computation of the leading electroweak corrections is the evaluation of the effective coupling of the higgs boson to gluons usually called @xmath16 .",
    "the operators appearing in the effective lagrangian are only defined in the effective theory and therefore receive no corrections involving the top quark .",
    "note that @xmath16 enters not only into the decay rate but constitutes also a building block for the gluon fusion process which will be the dominant mechanism for the production of the standard model higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider .",
    "the effective coupling to quarks is usually denoted by @xmath17 and was computed up to three loops in  @xcite .    it is well - known that the appelquist - carazzone decoupling theorem  @xcite does not hold true in its naive sense if a renormalization scheme based on minimal subtraction is used .",
    "this means that the contribution from a heavy quark @xmath18 with mass @xmath19 to a green function of gluons and light quarks does in general not show the expected @xmath20 suppression .",
    "the standard solution to this problem is to do the decoupling `` by hand '' and to construct an effective theory where the heavy quark is integrated out .",
    "the quantities relating the parameters , respectively , fields of the full theory to the corresponding quantities in the effective one are called decoupling constants . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that there is a tight connection between the ( renormalized ) coefficient functions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and @xmath21 , respectively , @xmath22 which perform the decoupling for the strong coupling constant @xmath2 and the light quark masses @xmath23 . concerning pure qcd , @xmath21 and @xmath22",

    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in the next section the notation is fixed and the theoretical framework developed in previous papers is reviewed .",
    "section  [ secren ] is concerned with the computation of the renormalization constants for the qcd parameters and fields up to order @xmath3 .",
    "although only the ones for the coupling constant @xmath2 and the light quark masses are needed we provide all renormalization constants of the qcd lagrangian up to this order . in section  [ secdec ] @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "are computed up to order @xmath3 .",
    "afterwards , in section  [ sechad ] , they are used in order to compute the coefficient functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the result for @xmath16 is compared with the direct evaluation of the triangle diagrams .",
    "@xmath16 is then combined with the expectation values of the correlators formed by the corresponding operator in order to get a prediction for the gluonic decay rate of the higgs boson .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in section  [ seccon ] .",
    "let us in this section fix the notation and present the theoretical framework used for the calculation .",
    "the leading electroweak corrections are conveniently expressed in terms of the variable @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath26 definition of the top quark mass which will be used throughout the paper .",
    "corrections proportional to @xmath27 arise if in addition to the pure qcd lagrangian also the couplings of the higgs boson ( @xmath18 ) and the neutral ( @xmath28 ) and charged ( @xmath29 ) goldstone boson to the top quark are considered .    for the evaluation of the decoupling constants it is necessary to know also the corresponding renormalization constants for the coupling and the masses @xmath30 up to the considered order .",

    "however , it is necessary to distinguish between the renormalization mode of the right and the left handed quark field , @xmath42 as they are treated differently in the electroweak theory . for qcd",
    "we have , of course , @xmath43 .",
    "the gauge parameter , @xmath44 , is defined through the gluon propagator in lowest order , @xmath45 the index `` 0 '' marks the bare quantities . starting from the three - loop order , @xmath35 , the renormalization constant for the fermion wave function and mass , @xmath46 and @xmath33 , depend on the quark species which is indicated by the additional index @xmath47 .",
    "it represents one of the flavours @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "( [ eqren ] ) and  ( [ eqren2 ] ) also hold for @xmath50 .",
    "if we refer to the four lightest quarks only the index @xmath47 will be replaced by @xmath51 .    in analogy",
    "it is possible to write down the relations between the quantities in the effective ( marked by a prime ) and the full theory .",
    "thereby we restrict ourselves to the case of the coupling constant and quark masses : @xmath52 here , of course , @xmath47 represents only one of the quarks @xmath53 or @xmath49 .",
    "it is more convenient to consider in a first step bare quantities and to perform the renormalization afterwards arriving at : @xmath54 in the order considered in this paper the quantities in the effective theory are independent of the quark species .",
    "thus , for the primed quantities the additional `` q '' is absent .",
    "a detailed derivation of the formulae for the computation of @xmath55 and @xmath56 was presented in  @xcite .",
    "in turned out that only those diagrams where at least one top quark line is present have to be considered .",
    "they have to be evaluated for vanishing external momentum .",

    "note , however , that the axial - vector part @xmath61 does not enter explicitly into our analysis of @xmath62 as only leading order corrections in @xmath27 are considered  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath63 on `` q '' is suppressed . @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the gluon and ghost vacuum polarizations and @xmath66 is obtained from the one - particle irreducible diagrams contributing to the @xmath67 green function  @xcite .",
    "the superscript `` h '' indicates that only the hard part of the respective quantities needs to be computed , i.e. only the diagrams involving the heavy quark contribute .",
    "the remaining paper is concerned with corrections of @xmath68 .",
    "therefore in the following the full theory still contains the top quark , i.e. @xmath69 is the number of active flavours , and in the effective one the top quark is integrated out ( @xmath70 ) .",

    "is considered .",
    "this process is affected by the virtual presence of the heavy top quark .",
