    "phase transitions lie at the heart of the modern development of statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "they are changes in the state of order of a system and can be classified based on their properties in the immediate proximity of the critical point .",
    "phase transitions are _ continuous _ ( or second - order ) , if the order parameter changes continuously across the two phases , with an infinite correlation length and consequent power law decay of correlations and divergence of higher moments of the order parameter at the critical point .",
    "otherwise one speaks of _ discontinuous _ ( first - order ) phase transitions , which are typically characterized by a discontinuous jump of the order parameter at the critical point .",
    "the purely geometric process known as _ random percolation _  @xcite offers a paradigmatic example of a continuous phase transition .",
    "the starting point is a graph , e. g. a lattice .",
    "the sites or the links of the lattice are occupied independently with some probability @xmath0 .",
    "nearest - neighboring occupied sites / links form structures called _",
    "clusters_. for low values of the occupation probability @xmath0 just a few small clusters are formed , but if @xmath0 increases the number and size of the clusters will increase as well .",
    "when the occupation probability exceeds a critical value @xmath1 , a macroscopic cluster , occupying a finite fraction of the total number of sites / links , emerges . this macroscopic structure is called _ percolation cluster _ and its relative size @xmath2 , the _ percolation strength _ , is the order parameter of the transition : @xmath3 indicates the phase with only microscopic clusters , whereas @xmath4 indicates the phase with ( at least ) one macroscopic cluster .",
    "random percolation has been studied on lattices , random graphs  @xcite and scale - free networks  @xcite .",
    "analytical and numerical studies have proved that the percolation transition is continuous , without exceptions .",
    "this however holds for random percolation .",
    "it can not be excluded _ a priori _ that alternative processes of occupation of sites / links might lead to different types of geometric transitions .    in a recent paper  @xcite , achlioptas et al .",
    "have introduced a special set of rules , in which links are occupied as a result of a competitive process between pairs of links ( _ achlioptas processes _ ) .",
    "the idea is to slow down the process of cluster growth , by inserting links leading to the merge of small clusters .",
    "this can be done in several ways .",
    "achlioptas et al .",
    "focused on the so - called _ product rule _ ( pr ) : given a pair of links , randomly selected among those which are not yet occupied , one occupies the link merging the two clusters with smaller product size ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "one could consider variants of this rule , like taking the sum instead of the product , or just the minimum size of the clusters of each pair .",
    "also , the competition can be extended to more than two links . in any case , the result of such processes is a slow growth of the cluster sizes , which causes a delay in the onset of the percolation transition . on the other hand ,",
    "since the density of links and , consequently , of clusters at the onset is higher than for random percolation , it is natural to expect that the percolation cluster has a very rapid growth .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by numerical studies ; in fact , the growth of the percolation cluster is so quick that the percolation strength @xmath2 appears to vary discontinuously at the onset .",
    "the sudden jump in the order parameter has motivated the name `` explosive percolation '' . in the last two years , achlioptas processes have been extensively studied and meanwhile a lot is known about the explosive percolation transition  @xcite .",
    "the main issue concerned the order of the transition : is it continuous or discontinuous ?",
    "achlioptas et al . claimed that it is discontinuous , and this is what has mostly attracted the attention of scholars .",
    "as a matter of fact , it was soon shown that , despite the alleged jump of the order parameter at the threshold @xmath1 , the explosive percolation transition has peculiar features of continuous phase transitions , like power law distributions of cluster sizes  @xcite and power law scaling of the mean cluster size at @xmath1  @xcite . indeed , in recent works by nagler et al .",
    "@xcite and da costa et al .",
    "@xcite it was proven that the transition is actually continuous , and that the jump of the order parameter is only apparent , and due to the very small critical exponent of the order parameter @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we summarize the finite size scaling analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , and verify that the results are indeed consistent with the analytical findings of da costa et al .. in section  [ sec1 ] we introduce finite size scaling , in section  [ sec2 ] we discuss the results for different types of graphs .",

    "finite size scaling  @xcite is a well - known technique adopted in numerical studies of phase transitions . for continuous phase transitions ,",
    "the correlation length is infinite at the critical threshold @xmath1 , so every variable @xmath6 is scale - independent in the proximity of that point and has a power law form , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a critical exponent .",

    "[ fig6 ] we show the results of our finite size scaling analysis for sf networks with exponent @xmath106 . for random percolation on sf networks",

    "these values coincide with the exponents for the percolation transition of erds - rnyi random networks .",

    "the explosive percolation transition looks as on lattices and er random networks .",

    "we have found two different classes of phase transitions for explosive percolation , that we shall call class a and b. class a includes er random networks ( the original system studied by achlioptas et al .",
    "@xcite ) , lattices and sf networks with degree exponent @xmath94 . here",
    "we have observed an apparent saturation of the order parameter @xmath2 at @xmath1 with the size of the system @xmath9 , due to an exponent @xmath5 that is very small , compatible with zero .",
    "class b includes sf networks with @xmath89 , where there seems to be no room for a discontinuous transition , as the results of the finite size scaling analysis are fully compatible with a standard continuous transition .",
    "still , apart from the anomalous scaling behavior of the order parameter @xmath2 at @xmath1 observed in class a , we found that the other percolation variables display power law scaling in all cases , without exceptions , just as in second - order phase transitions .",
    "the most striking feature is the fact that the size distribution @xmath21 of the `` finite '' clusters at @xmath1 is a power law , not exponential or gaussian as one expects from first - order phase transitions .",
    "da costa et al .",
    "@xcite have recently proved that an aggregation process in the same spirit as achlioptas processes leads to a continuous phase transition , characterized by an exponent @xmath5 for the order parameter @xmath2 that is very small , @xmath113 .",
    "they also demonstrated that the fact that the transition is continuous for the special process they considered enforces the same type of transition for achlioptas processes too , with generally different but still small values for @xmath5 .",
    "this is fully consistent with what we have found for the systems of class a. da costa et al .",
    "have derived important relations for the critical exponents .",
    "for instance , @xmath114 and the fisher exponent @xmath115 .",
    "for @xmath113 the exponents ratio @xmath116 .",
    "this value is compatible , within errors , with the values of @xmath52 computed for the systems of class a ( see table 1 ) .",
    "so , the apparent saturation of the order parameter @xmath2 with the system size @xmath9 could be indeed due to the smallness of the exponent @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the fisher exponent @xmath28 for every transition we have investigated is very close to @xmath117 . from the relation @xmath118 , and",
    "the fact that @xmath5 is small , we see that @xmath28 will always be very close to @xmath117 , just as we found .",
    "the difference between @xmath28 and @xmath117 is hard to determine numerically .",
    "likewise , the values of @xmath28 derived from different achlioptas processes can be hardly distinguished from each other .",
    "we remark that this holds for lattices , erds - rnyi graphs and sf networks with degree exponent @xmath94 , while the explosive percolation transition on sf networks with @xmath89 appears as something very different ( @xmath5 is not small here ) , and deserves further investigations in the future .",
    "we have also found that there is a non - zero explosive percolation threshold for sf networks for @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ figthres ] ) , while the threshold for random percolation is zero as long as @xmath119 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested that this is due to the non - random addition of links during the achlioptas process , because of which the degree distribution of the system during the growth deviates from that imposed by construction , which will be eventually reached at the end of the process .",
    "this has been indeed verified numerically  @xcite .",
