    "the data accumulated by the atlas and cms experiments in run 1 at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , at 7 and 8 tev , have allowed the study of higgs boson production to move from the discovery phase to the beginning of the precision measurement phase . with the increased statistics of the data",
    "comes the need for a better understanding of the theoretical uncertainties on the prediction of the cross section for higgs boson production .",
    "the production cross section , @xmath6 , of the primary subprocess , gluon - gluon ( @xmath7 ) fusion , is known to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in perturbative qcd  @xcite in the infinite top mass limit and to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in electroweak corrections  @xcite .",
    "resummation predictions have improved the theoretical precision to next - to - next - to - leading order plus next - to - next - to - leading logs ( nnlo+nnll )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , approximations of the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnnlo ) qcd corrections are available @xcite , and corrections for finite @xmath8 have been calculated @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties from these calculations of the hard cross section , which are still sizable due to the truncation of the perturbative series , can be estimated by varying the renormalization and factorization scales  traditionally by a factor of two around a central scale of higgs boson mass @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "another sizable theoretical uncertainty for the @xmath7 channel is that due to the uncertainty on the gluon parton distribution function in the relevant kinematic region .",
    "the @xmath7 pdf luminosity has been well - studied : see , for example , the recent benchmark paper @xcite .",
    "there is reasonable , though not totally satisfying , agreement for the @xmath7 pdf luminosity predictions from the three global pdf fitting groups cteq - tea ( ct )  @xcite , mstw @xcite , and nnpdf  @xcite .    because of the importance of higgs boson production , particularly in the @xmath7 channel , it is important to re - examine the pdf uncertainties , as well as the related @xmath3 uncertainty , for the cross section @xmath11 . in this paper , we calculate the pdf error @xmath12 using two different methods : the well - known hessian method  @xcite and the lagrange multiplier method  @xcite .",
    "we then compare the uncertainty determinations from these two methods .",
    "this work follows the global analysis framework of the recently published ct10 nnlo pdfs  @xcite ( but with some lhc data added in the study ) to estimate the error on @xmath11 at center - of - mass energies 7 , 8 and 14 tev .",
    "we are partly motivated in this paper by the results of the benchmark calculations in ref .",
    "different pdfs give somewhat different predictions for the cross section @xmath11 , and also somewhat different uncertainties for the predictions ; cf .",
    "appendix b. most of the benchmark calculations relied on error pdfs obtained using the hessian method .",
    "the central predictions are fairly consistent within the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "but the result raises the question whether the hessian method is sufficient .",
    "we will therefore compare hessian and lagrange multiplier calculations to test whether the hessian method is trustworthy .",
    "our other goal is to examine how the pdf dependence in various higgs production channels is related through their shared degrees of freedom , and which experiments in the ct10 analysis constrain the gluon pdf in the kinematical region of standard model ( sm ) higgs production .",
    "the two analysis methods provide complementary quantitative information in this regard . using the hessian method",
    ", we observe the pull of various error pdfs on the higgs boson cross section measurement .",
    "we also compute the correlation cosines  @xcite between the gluon pdf and higgs boson production cross sections in @xmath7 and vector boson fusion ( vbf ) processes . within the context of the lagrange multiplier method",
    ", we identify the experimental data sets included in our global analysis that correlate most strongly with the value of @xmath6 via @xmath7 channel .",
    "this is done by introducing an equivalent gaussian variable @xmath13 @xcite for every fitted data set , which provides an alternative to the usual chi - square distribution and streamlines comparisons of constraints from heterogenous experiments .",
    "in this study the calculation of the @xmath14 cross section that we use is nnlo , with the corrections obtained in the infinite @xmath8 limit .",
    "we do not include finite @xmath8 corrections or approximations that go beyond nnlo .",
    "these corrections can be calculated using the central pdfs , while their effect on the pdf errors would be small , of order 5% of the corrections themselves .",
    "because our interest is in the pdf uncertainty for @xmath11 , we omit these corrections . by using a strictly nnlo calculation , we use the same order of approximation as the benchmark calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the theoretical background for the pdf global analysis and list the experimental inputs .",
    "we then review the two frameworks for calculating pdf uncertainties : the hessian method and the lagrange multiplier ( lm ) method .",
    "the lm method is safer and more powerful ; but it requires the full global pdf analysis machinery to make predictions . in section iii",
    ", we study the pdf uncertainties for higgs boson production using each of the two methods , and compare their results .",
    "we also investigate the combined uncertainties in higgs boson production coming from the pdfs and from @xmath2 in the two methods . in the lagrange multiplier method",
    "we examine the correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath2 by constructing contour plots of the global @xmath15 as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath2 .",
    "this result is then compared to that given by the hessian method . in section iv",
    ", we investigate in more detail the correlation between the higgs boson production cross section and the pdfs , and the origins of experimental constraints on the pdf dependence of the @xmath16 cross section .",
    "finally , we compare the best - fit gluon pdfs , which correspond to various predictions for @xmath6 , to the error band of the ct10 nnlo pdfs .",
    "section v contains our conclusions .",
    "the cteq - tea ( ct ) global analysis procedure has been extensively discussed in previous papers  @xcite . here",
    "we review some aspects that are especially important for the application to @xmath6 .",
    "the ct parton distributions are obtained from global analysis of short - distance processes using a `` best - fit '' paradigm in which the pdfs are constructed by minimizing a global @xmath17 function .",
    "the basic global chi - square function is defined by @xmath18^{2 } } { \\alpha_{\\nu}^{2 } } + \\sum_{k}r_{k}^{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 labels an experimental data set and @xmath20 labels a data point in that data set .",
    "@xmath21 is the central data value , @xmath22 is the uncorrelated error , and @xmath23 is the @xmath24-th correlated systematic error estimate .",
    "these numbers are provided by the experimental collaborations .",
    "@xmath25 is the theoretical prediction , which is a function of a set of @xmath26 pdf parameters , @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , @xmath28 is a set of gaussian random variables ; thus , @xmath29 is a ( correlated ) shift applied to @xmath21 to represent the @xmath24-th systematic error .",
    "we minimize the function @xmath30 with respect to both the pdf parameters @xmath31 and the systematic shift variables @xmath28 .",
    "the result yields both the standard pdf model with parameters @xmath32 , and the optimal shifts @xmath33 to bring theory and data into agreement .",
    "this minimum of @xmath34 represents the central fit to the data  @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : exp_bin_id ] shows the experimental data sets employed in the current study .",
    "most of these data are the same as those used to produce the ct10 nnlo pdfs  @xcite .",
    "one of the new data sets included in this study is the lhc data on @xmath35 and @xmath36 production at atlas , labelled i d number 268 , which is a combined data set with the measurements of lepton rapidity distributions from the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath36 boson productions and the charged lepton rapidity asymmetry  @xcite at the lhc with 7 tev center - of - mass energy .",
    "this combined data set is analyzed with the full set of correlated systematic errors , including the collider luminosity error , implemented .",
    "another new data set included in this study is the atlas single inclusive jet production  @xcite measured in anti-@xmath39 algorithm with jet size parameter @xmath40 , at the lhc with a 7 tev center - of - mass energy .",
    "the i d number of this data set is 535 .",
    "we include these data because they come from lhc energies and may therefore be particularly relevant to @xmath11 at the lhc .    in this study , we use a somewhat more flexible parametrization for the gluon distribution function than was used for the ct10 nnlo pdfs .",
    "our interest is the process @xmath14 , which obviously depends directly on the gluon pdf , so allowing a very flexible parametrization is important to reveal the full range of the @xmath11 uncertainty .",
    "we will refer to the pdfs obtained in the current study as ct10h nnlo pdf sets , to distinguish them from the standard ct10 nnlo pdfs .",
    "the two global fits may differ slightly because ( i ) the ct10h fit includes some lhc ( @xmath41 , @xmath36 and jet ) data not used for ct10 ; and ( ii ) the gluon distribution of ct10h has a more flexible form .",
    "however , the central fits for ct10h and ct10 differ little .",
    "for that reason , and because ct10 nnlo pdfs have already been used by lhc experiments , we do not advocate that ct10h pdfs be used for general purpose pdfs .",
    "ct10 nnlo will continue to be our standard general purpose pdfs , until they are superseded by a successor to ct10 that includes input from more extensive lhc data and the final results from hera .",
    "table [ tab : exp_bin_id ] indicates that the ct10h nnlo pdfs are in satisfactory agreement with all the data sets included in the current analysis , similar to the agreement seen in the ct10 nnlo analysis .",
    "the relationship between the goodness - of - fit for specific experiments and the pdfs , and in particular the correlations between some experimental data sets and the higgs boson cross section , will be discussed further in sections 3 and 4 .",
    ".experimental data sets employed in our analysis .",

    "the total number of data points is 2797 .",
