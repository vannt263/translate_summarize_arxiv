    "however , it is not yet completely settled whether , in all four cases , the quartic hamiltonian ( [ hh4:gen ] ) displays the same pattern as the cubic hamiltonian ( [ hh3:gen ] ) , i.  e.     * the equations of motion can be integrated with hyperelliptic functions of genus two , * there exists an equivalence with the stationary reduction of some partial differential equation ( pde ) belonging to the kp , bkp and ckp hierarchies .    in this paper",

    "by further putting some symmetry constraint on @xmath20 and @xmath21 , let us define as follows four ( 2 + 1)-dimensional pdes ( see line `` 2 + 1 '' in figure [ fign+1 ] ) .    1 .   with the system ( [ eq : ckpbilinear ] ) , one defines by @xmath23 @xcite the ( 2 + 1)-dim pde labeled `` kp-1 '' in figure [ fign+1 ] .",

    ". therefore the chain of reductions generated from the systems ( [ eq : kpbilinear ] ) and ( [ eq : mkpbilinear ] ) contains the full information for the integration of hh3 .",
    "let us now show that figure [ fign+1 ] also contains the full information for the integration of hh4 .",
    "this will involve two kinds of coupled kdv ( ) systems : some with a fourth order lax pair , some with a fifth order lax pair .",
    "in the variables @xmath54 , the bilinear system ( [ eq : bilinearbish ] ) is rewritten as the  system @xcite @xmath55 with the notation @xmath45 .",
    "this system possesses the fourth order lax pair @xcite @xmath56    under the miura transformation denoted @xmath57 in figure [ figlax4 ] @xmath58 the system ( [ eq : systemhsii ] ) is mapped to the following  system ( denoted @xmath59 in figure [ figlax4 ] ) given in @xcite @xmath60 with the lax pair @xmath61    the stationary reduction of this @xmath59 system happens to be the case 1:6:8 of hh4 for arbitrary values of @xmath62 .",
    "the field @xmath63 of ( [ eq : systemhsii ] ) satisfies the sixth order pde @xcite , @xmath64 which is of second order in time and which for this reason we call bidirectional satsuma - hirota ( ) equation .",
    "its stationary reduction is identical to the autonomous case of the f - vi nonlinear ode , integrated @xcite with genus - two hyperelliptic functions .",
    "therefore , since there exists a path from the ( not yet integrated in its full generality ) 1:6:8 hh4 case and the ( integrated ) autonomous f - vi ode , the general solution of the 1:6:8 can in principle be obtained , this will be addressed in future work .",
    "all the links between the system ( [ eq : systemhsii ] ) and other  systems considered by s.  baker and which reduce to the integrable cases 1:6:1 and 1:6:8 of hh4 are displayed in figure [ figlax4 ] .",
    "finally , let us explain the link between the 1:12:16 integrable case of hh4 and two  systems possessing a fifth order lax pair , systems respectively equivalent to the  equation ( [ eq : ramani ] ) and the  equation ( [ eq : pbikk ] ) .",
    "the following coupled system @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 are nonzero constants , arises from the compatibility condition of the fifth order lax pair @xmath67 the field @xmath63 of ( [ eq : cramani ] ) satisfies the sixth order pde @xmath68 identical to the  equation ( [ eq : ramani ] ) for @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , the coupled system @xcite @xmath70 arises from the compatibility condition of the other fifth order lax pair @xmath71    the field @xmath63 satisfies the sixth order pde @xmath72 identical to the potential  equation ( [ eq : pbikk ] ) for @xmath73 .",
    "the property of these two systems which is of interest to us is the existence of two mappings , respectively ( setting @xmath74 ) , for the system ( [ eq : cramani ] ) the miura transformation denoted @xmath75 @xmath76 and , for the system ( [ eq : cbikk ] ) , the transformation denoted @xmath77 @xmath78 to a common coupled kdv - type system @xcite ( denoted @xmath79 in figure [ figlax5 ] )    @xmath80    this system also possesses a fifth order lax pair , which can be written in two different ways , either @xmath81 or @xmath82    it happens that the stationary reduction of ( [ eq : ckdvunphysical ] ) , which is an unphysical hamiltonian system @xcite , is mapped by a canonical transformation to the 1:12:16 case of hh4 .    in figure",
    "[ figlax5 ] , we display the link between  systems possessing a fifth order lax pair and the 1:12:16 integrable hamiltonian .",
    "we have linked each of the three not yet integrated quartic hnon - heiles cases to fourth order odes recently integrated by cosgrove , _ via _ a path involving , on one hand canonical transformations between hamiltonian systems , and on the other hand bcklund transformations between coupled kdv systems .",
