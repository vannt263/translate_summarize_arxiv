    "<S> we notice that the result from dft and that from the tb models have similar tendencies , whereas they are different by a factor of two smaller or larger , depending on the series @xmath0 and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this difference between dft and the tb model can be partly attributed to the difference of the gap size . in the result of the 2b model in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sign ] ) , the polarization is inversely proportional to the gap size , because @xmath95 is much larger than @xmath96 for the given parameters . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the gap size obtained from dft is smaller ( larger ) than that of the tb model for @xmath0 ( @xmath27 ) even at @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to incorporate this difference of the gap size , we rescale the results of the polarization of the tb model by the ratio between the gaps from the dft and that of the tb model . </S>",
    "<S> this rescaling enhances ( suppresses ) the polarization for @xmath0 ( @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> after the rescaling , the results ( solid lines in fig .  [ dft_polarization ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) exhibits better agreement with the dft results . </S>",

    "<S> the results of the tb with ( without ) rescaling by the gap size are shown as a solid line ( dotted line ) ( see text ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) ( @xmath97 ) are for @xmath0 , and ( b ) ( @xmath98 ) are for @xmath27 . </S>",

    "<S> , width=328 ]    to experimentally measure this proposed effect , one needs a bilayer nanoribbon with well - defined edges and width . for single - layer graphene nanoribbons , </S>",
    "<S> well - defined edge orientations have been demonstrated @xcite , and it might be realized also for bilayer graphene . for the bilayer graphene , </S>",
    "<S> interlayer electric field up to 0.3v /   has been achieved@xcite , and therefore the proposed effect with polarization up to @xmath1020.12@xmath42 per spin for @xmath103 is expected to be realizable experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> we also have calculated the effect of periodic modulations of the width to check the edge disorder effect via supercell approach and confirmed that the polarization survives the weak modulations considered @xcite . nevertheless , </S>",
    "<S> since the effect is sensitive to the ribbon width , the proposed effect will disappear in the presence of strong disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that the in - plane polarization by an interlayer bias can be expected for a wide variety of atomic - layer compounds , as long as the symmetry criterion for its emergence is satisfied . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , a bilayer armchair ribbon of transition metal dichalcogenides in the 2h stacking satisfies this criteria . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our calculation show induced polarization in aa-stacked bilayer boron nitride nanoribbons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a wide choice of candidate materials provides us with many chances for experimental verifications of our theory .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we theoretically show that the ab - stacked graphene nanoribbon with armchair edges has a polarization along the ribbon direction , when interlayer bias voltage is applied . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown both by the simple tight - binding model and the _ ab initio _ calculations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the linear response to the interlayer voltage shows different signs for the cases @xmath0 and @xmath27 , and it is fully understood by means of a simple two - band model .    </S>",
