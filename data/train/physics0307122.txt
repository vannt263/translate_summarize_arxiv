    "acoustic waves guided by the surface of solid structures form waveguides used as delay lines and filters in telecommunications @xcite .",
    "waveguides support different modes with specific strain and stress fields @xcite .",
    "the acoustic velocity of each mode depends on different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters such as the mechanical properties of the materials , the temperature or the applied pressure .",
    "waveguides are used as sensors when the velocity change is linked to environmental changes . for gravimetric sensors , the outer surface of the waveguide",
    "is exposed to mass changes . due to the confinement of the acoustic wave energy close to the surface ,",
    "these sensors are well suited for ( bio)chemical sensors operating in gas or liquid environments . among a wide variety of waveguides used for that purpose ,",
    "love mode sensors have attracted an increasing interest during the last decade @xcite .",
    "a love mode is guided by a solid overlayer deposited on top of a substrate material .",
    "the usual substrates are piezoelectric materials like quartz , lithium tantalate and lithium niobate @xcite . associated to specific crystal cut of these substrates , the love mode presents a shear - horizontal polarization that makes it ideal for sensing in liquid media .",
    "current research in love mode sensors concerns the guiding materials in order to obtain a high gravimetric sensitivity .",
    "typical materials under investigations are dielectrics like silicon dioxide and polymers , and more recently semiconductors with piezoelectric properties like zinc oxide @xcite . although the dispersion relation for love mode is well set and the dependence of the gravimetric sensitivity of the liquid loaded sensor to the overlayer thickness has been thoroughly investigated @xcite , little has been devoted to study the role played by the structure of the sensor and the transducers .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the role played by the structure of the sensor and the interferences between the acoustic and the electromagnetic waves on the gravimetric sensitivity . in the first part , we present a model of the transfer function including the influence of electromagnetic interferences . in the second part",
    ", we show how these interferences modify the gravimetric sensitivity in open and closed loop configurations of the sensor .",
    "finally , these effects are illustrated experimentally on a love mode sensor .",
    "waveguide sensors consist of a transducing part and a sensing part .",
    "the transducing part includes the generation and the reception of acoustic signals and their interfacing to an electrical instrumentation .",
    "the most common transducers are the widespread interdigital transducers ( idts ) on piezoelectric substrates introduced by white and voltmer in 1965 @xcite . although the transducing part can be involved in the sensing part , practical sensing is confined to the spacing between the transducers .",
    "this confinement takes especially place when liquids are involved since these produce large and unwanted capacitive coupling between input and output electrical transducers .",
    "this coupling dramatically deteriorates the transfer function and is an important issue for the instrumentation of the sensors .",
    "the sensor is a delay line formed by the transducers and the distance separating them .",
    "each transducer is identified to its midpoint .",
    "the distance between the midpoints is @xmath0 .",
    "the sensing part is located between the transducers and covers a total length @xmath1 so that @xmath2 .",
    "the guided mode propagates with a phase velocity @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the angular frequency and @xmath5 is the wavenumber .",
    "the waveguide is dispersive when the group velocity @xmath6 differs from the phase velocity .",
    "the velocity is a function of the frequency and of the surface density @xmath7 for a rigidly bound mass @xmath8 per surface area @xmath9 . for an uniformly distributed mass ,",
    "the surface density is rewritten in terms of material density @xmath10 and thickness @xmath11 by @xmath12 .",
    "the phase velocity for an initial and constant mass @xmath13 is denoted @xmath14 , and the group velocity @xmath15 . in the sensing part ,",
    "the phase velocity is @xmath16 and the group velocity @xmath17 . according to this model",
    ", the transit time @xmath18 of this delay line is given by : @xmath19    electromagnetic interferences are due to the cross - talk between the idts .",
    "the electromagnetic wave ( em ) emitted by the input transducer travels much faster than the acoustic wave and therefore is detected at the output transducer without noticeable delay . at the output transducer , the two kinds of waves interact with an amplitude ratio , denoted by @xmath20 , that creates interference patterns in the transfer function @xmath21 of the delay line .",
    "the transfer function itself is given by the ratio of the output to the input voltages .",
    "the transfer function with electromagnetic interferences is modelled by the following equation : @xmath22 the transfer function @xmath23 is associated to the design of the transducers . the total transfer function can be rewritten as @xmath24 where expressions for the amplitude @xmath25 and the phase @xmath26 are obtained with help of complex algebra : @xmath27 the phase @xmath28 corresponds to the packaging of the sensor and is due to different aspects linked to the instrumentation .",
    "it will be assumed independent of the frequency and of the sensing event .",
    "the relations ( [ eq : h ] ) and ( [ eq : phi ] ) are the sources of ripples in the transfer function at the ripple frequency @xmath29 .",
    "the relative amplitude peak to peak of the perturbation on the amplitude has a maximum effect ( in db ) equals to @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the amplitude ( in db and normalized to have @xmath31 ) and the phase ( in radians ) as a function of the frequency are simulated in figures  [ fig : phasealpha0 ] to [ fig : phasealpha3 ] for different values of @xmath20 .    under the influence of the interferences ,",
    "the phase has different behaviors function of @xmath20 :    1 .",
    "when @xmath32 ( no interferences ) , the phase is linear with the frequency and has a periodicity equal to @xmath33 ( fig.[fig : phasealpha0 ] ) ; 2 .   when @xmath34 , the phase is deformed but has still a periodicity equal to @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasealpha1 ] ) ; 3 .",
    "when @xmath35 , the phase has a periodicity equal to @xmath36 ( fig .",

    "when @xmath38 , the phase is not periodic anymore and its value tends to @xmath28 .",
    "this specific behavior of the phase has to be considered for the evaluation of the gravimetric sensitivity .",
    "changes in the boundary condition of the waveguide due to the sensing event modify phase and group velocities . as consequence , the transit time of the delay line and the phase of the transfer function are modified . the sensing event",
    "is quantified by recording the phase shift at a fixed frequency ( open loop configuration ) or the frequency shift at a fixed phase ( closed loop configuration ) .",
    "this quantification gives rise to the concept of sensitivity .",
    "the sensitivity is the most important parameter in design , calibration and applications of acoustic waveguide sensors .",
    "its measurement must be carefully addressed in order to extract the intrinsic properties of the sensor .",

    "the expression is general because the initial velocity @xmath16 of the sensing part does not need to be equal to @xmath14 ; this situation occurs in practical situations where the sensing part has a selective coating with its own mechanical properties , leading to a difference between @xmath16 and @xmath14 .    to link the gravimetric sensitivity ( caused by the unknown velocity shift ) to the experimental values of phase and frequency shifts , we introduce two additional definitions related to the open and the close loop configurations , respectively .",

    "( [ ap : eq : b ] ) ; related phase variations caused by surface density variations are obtained by @xmath53    in the absence of interferences , phase variations obtained experimentally are directly linked to velocity changes by the product @xmath54 involving the geometry of the sensor as seen by replacing eq .",

    "in a first approximation @xmath57 is assumed equal to @xmath58 determined by the periodicity of the interdigitated electrodes in the transducer . this assumption is valid as long as the phase shift is evaluated close to the central frequency @xmath59 and for waveguides with low dispersion .",
    "the wavelength is only known when the sensing part extends to the transducers ( @xmath60 ) . in that case",
    ", the transfer function of the transducers is modified as well by the velocity changes . in practice the value of the sensitivity",
    "is slightly underestimated to its exact value since @xmath61 , the error being of the order of @xmath62 .    in the case where interferences occur ,",
    "the partial differential of @xmath26 with respect to the velocity is obtained by differentiation of eq .",

    "( [ eq : phaseomsigma2 ] ) : @xmath69    at the opposite of the open loop configuration , the frequency sensitivity is not influenced by the interferences .",
    "the perturbation caused by interferences on the aspect of the phase is cancelled by the closed loop configuration . however , as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : somegainterf ] ) , the frequency sensitivity is strongly dependent of the structure of the sensor and the velocities in the different parts of the sensor .",
    "a simple expression can not be deduced easily and the link between the frequency sensitivity and the gravimetric sensitivity is difficult to exploit directly unless some assumptions are considered as explained here after .",
    "if the waveguide is not dispersive and @xmath70 , frequency variations obtained experimentally are directly linked to the gravimetric sensitivity by the ratio @xmath71 as seen by replacing the transit time obtained via eq .",
    "( [ ap : eq : f ] ) in eq .",

    "if the sensing part extends to the entire delay line ( @xmath60 ) , we obtain an expression corresponding to a well - known result ( for instance @xcite ) : @xmath73",
    "for the practical consideration of the described behavior , we investigated a love mode sensor .",
    "it was fabricated and tested under liquid conditions to evaluate the influence of the electromagnetic interferences .",
    "the love mode was obtained by conversion of a surface skimming bulk wave ( ssbw ) launched in the direction perpendicular to the crystalline x axis of a @xmath74 thick st - cut ( @xmath75 y - cut ) quartz substrate .",
    "the conversion was achieved by a @xmath76 thick overlayer of silicon dioxide deposited on the top side of the substrate by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( plasmalab 100 from oxford plasma technology , england ) .",
    "vias were etched in the silicon dioxide layer using a standard @xmath77 plasma etch recipe .",
    "this process stopped automatically on the aluminium contact pads of the transducers .",
    "the transducers consist of split fingers electrodes etched in @xmath78 nm thick sputtered aluminium .",
    "the fingers are @xmath79 wide and equally spaced by @xmath80 .",
    "this defines a periodicity @xmath81 of @xmath82 .",
    "the acoustic aperture defined by the overlap of the fingers is equal to @xmath83 (= 3.2 mm ) , the total length of each idt is @xmath84 (= 4 mm ) and the distance center to center of the idts is @xmath85 ( @xmath0= 9 mm , @xmath1= 5 mm ) .",
    "the sensing area was defined by covering the space left between the edges of the idts by successive evaporation and lift - off of 10 nm of titanium and 50 nm of gold in a first experiment , and 200 nm of gold in a second experiment .",
    "the fingers were protected against liquid by patterning photosensitive epoxy su-8 2075 ( microchem corp .",
    ", ma ) defining @xmath86 thick and @xmath87 wide walls around the idts .",
    "quartz glasses of 5 by 5 @xmath88 were glued on top of the walls to finalize the protection of the idts .    the device was mounted and wire - bonded to an epoxy printed circuit board and its transfer function was recorded on a hp4396a network analyzer .",
    "this setup corresponds to the open loop configuration .",
    "epoxy around the device covered and protected it and defined a leak - free liquid cell .",
    "the sensing area was immersed in a solution of @xmath89 ( 4 g and 1 g respectively in 160 ml of water ) that etched the gold away of the surface @xcite .",
    "the transfer function of the device was recorded every 4 seconds ( limited by the gpib transfer speed ) during the etching of the gold with a resolution of 801 points over a span of 2 mhz centered around 123.5 mhz .",
    "the initial transfer function of the device is presented in figure  [ fig : w38d17init ] with and without gold . the transfer function during etching of the 200 nm is shown at two moments ( 44 seconds and 356 seconds after etching start ) in figure  [ fig : w38d17etch ] .",
    "the total time for this etching was approximately 620 seconds .",
    "the sensitivity was calculated by etching of 50 nm of gold and assuming a density @xmath90 .",
    "the result is plotted versus the frequency in figure  [ fig : sens50 nm ] .",
    "electromagnetic interferences have a clear effect on the transfer function because of the ripples they cause .",
    "the interaction modelled as a constant factor @xmath20 is specific to each device and must be identified via a careful inspection of the transfer function .",
    "the amplitude of the transfer function peak to peak is supposed to be the product between the transfer function of the transducers and the interference , and therefore an evaluation of @xmath20 is possible if the transfer function of the transducers only is known .",
    "however , the experiment shows that @xmath20 is a function of the frequency and the surface density , indicating that finding its exact value is not straightforward .",
    "only the phase indicates whether @xmath20 is higher or lower than one .    in term of sensitivity , when @xmath91 the phase has a periodicity @xmath92 in the range @xmath93 to @xmath36 .",
    "we suggest the following correction to the experimental phase sensitivity : @xmath94 this modification gives a better evaluation of the gravimetric sensitivity by stretching the phase of the transfer function to @xmath33 .",
    "only the extraction of @xmath92 is not immediate since it depends upon @xmath20 .",
    "finally , we must mention that the experimental part is not exactly providing a differential surface density @xmath95 .",
    "indeed , etching of @xmath96 of gold corresponds to a surface density change of @xmath97 .",
    "this is a relatively large shift compared to the targeted biochemical recognition application where protein films surface density are in the order of @xmath98 .",
    "the evaluation of the sensitivity is best recorded by adding or etching thin layers of materials and that under the operating conditions of the sensor , especially if liquids are involved @xcite .",
    "we have proposed a model for surface acoustic waveguides used as sensors .",
    "the model shows the influence of electromagnetic interferences caused by interdigital transducers on the gravimetric sensitivity in open and closed loop configurations . in both cases , the dimensions of the delay line and the sensing part influence the experimental value of phase or frequency shifts .    in an open loop configuration and with interferences ,",
    "the _ phase _ shift is disturbed and the sensitivity is over- or under - estimated to the value of the gravimetric sensitivity . for strong interferences ,",
    "the phase has a periodicity lower than @xmath33 that must be considered when normalizing the phase shift to obtain a correct figure of the sensitivity .    in a closed loop configuration and with interferences ,",
    "the _ frequency _ shift is not disturbed .",
    "the frequency shift is proportional to the sensitivity by the ratio between the length of the sensing area and the distance separating the transducers .",
    "in addition , the frequency shift is influenced by the dispersive properties of the waveguide .",
    "the influence of the electromagnetic interferences on the transfer function of a love mode sensor operating in liquid conditions was presented for a comparison . from the experiment it appears that the interferences are function of both the frequency and the surface density .    for future investigations , an analytical expression of the electromagnetic - acoustic interaction and the parameters acting on it",
