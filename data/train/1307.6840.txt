    "one of the most interesting challenges in hadronic physics is to study the internal structure of baryons and mesons .",
    "a microscopic understanding of the transition between the hadronic states is also very important .",
    "although it is generally accepted that the internal structure of hadrons and the dynamics of quarks and gluons , are described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , one has to rely on some effective degrees of freedom in the nonperturbative low @xmath5 region such as constituent quarks which form baryon cores with meson cloud excitations  @xcite .",
    "although there exist some works which attempted to treat the meson cloud explicitly as the @xmath6 excitations in the so - called _ unquenched quark models _",
    "@xcite , most of the phenomenological models treat the meson cloud using pointlike meson excitations .",
    "particular examples of very interesting studies may be the electromagnetic transitions between an octet baryon @xmath7 ( spin 1/2 ) and a decuplet baryon @xmath8 ( spin 3/2 ) , @xmath9 , and the @xmath8 electromagnetic decay reactions , @xmath10 .",
    "there are theoretical predictions for the @xmath9 transition magnetic moments based on quark models  @xcite , including quark models with meson cloud dressing  @xcite , skyrme and soliton models  @xcite , large @xmath11 limit  @xcite , qcd sum rules  @xcite , and chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "there are also some results from lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "one of the strong motivations to study the @xmath9 reactions is to clarify the role of the meson cloud dressing , which is of fundamental importance , as was demonstrated by the @xmath12 reaction  @xcite . the data , except for the @xmath12 reaction , namely the @xmath13 and @xmath14 decay widths , have become available only recently  @xcite .",
    "in general , most of the model predictions significantly underestimate the data , particularly those for the @xmath14 decay width ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we studied the @xmath9 reactions using a covariant constituent quark model , complemented by the pion cloud effects extrapolated by the @xmath12 reaction based on an su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the pion cloud effects were included in the leading order , namely , they included only the processes with the direct photon coupling to the pion .",
    "the electromagnetic transition form factors calculated were decomposed into the valence quark and pion cloud contributions .",
    "we concluded that the pion cloud effects could help to explain satisfactorily the @xmath12 data , but only partially help to explain the data for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 reactions .",
    "therefore , the other effects , such as the contributions from the heavier mesons like the kaon , and alternative higher order processes involving the meson cloud , may be relevant to explain the experimental decay widths .",
    "the next - order processes to be included in this study are the processes which one photon couples to the intermediate baryon states while one meson is in the air .",
    "in addition , the heavier mesons to be taken into account are the kaon and eta meson , the next lighter mesons to the pion .    in a model with pointlike quarks the photon coupling with the intermediate baryon states",
    "is not expected to be important for the meson cloud contributions , since the octet to the decuplet electromagnetic transitions are dominated by the magnetic interactions , and the quark anomalous magnetic moments vanish for the pointlike quarks . however , in a constituent quark model like the one we use in this study , the covariant spectator quark model , the octet - decuplet electromagnetic transitions are dominated by the mechanisms with a quark spin flip ( magnetic type interactions ) .",
    "therefore , the valence quark contributions may be very important when the quark anomalous magnetic moments are significant .",
    "furthermore , we can expect important meson cloud contributions from the intermediate octet - decuplet baryon electromagnetic transitions while one meson is in the air ( photon - vertex correction ) , since these mechanisms also depend on the quark anomalous magnetic moments .    in this work",
    "we improve the calculation of the meson cloud contributions for the @xmath9 transitions made in the previous work  @xcite , and predict the corresponding electromagnetic decay widths ( determined at @xmath0 ) .",
    "the improvements are the following : i ) inclusion of the photon coupling to the intermediate baryon states ; ii ) inclusion of the effects of the heavier meson clouds , kaon and eta meson , besides the pion .",
    "as in the previous work , the transition form factors can be decomposed into the valence quark and meson cloud contributions .",
    "the processes included as the meson cloud contributions in this work are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figmesoncloud ] , in terms of the meson and baryon degrees of freedom .",
    "we will conclude that the effects of the intermediate baryon states combined with the kaon cloud , improve the agreement of our model with the experimental data .",
    "the valence quark contributions are estimated based on the covariant spectator quark model  @xcite as in the previous work .",
    "thus , the baryons are described as three - quark systems .",
    "the valence quark contributions for the transition form factors are calculated using the octet and decuplet baryon wave functions and the quark electromagnetic current of the model , determined in the previous works .    to describe the meson cloud contributions for the octet - decuplet baryon electromagnetic transitions we need a microscopic model to describe the virtual meson - baryon states .",
    "contrary to the valence quark contributions that dominate in the large @xmath5 region , the meson cloud effects are long - range processes , and are known to be of crucial to explain the transition helicity amplitudes and form factors in the low @xmath5 region  @xcite .",
    "to incorporate the meson cloud effects , we use the cloudy bag model ( cbm )  @xcite which treats the mesons as pointlike particles to describe the meson cloud dressing in the static approximation for the baryons .",
    "all such approximations have been practiced well in the past within the cbm , and may be regarded as under control .    ) and final decuplet ( @xmath8 ) baryon states , there are several possible intermediate baryon states : ( a ) @xmath15 ; ( b ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 . depending on the meson @xmath17 , meson - baryon states ( @xmath17-@xmath15 and @xmath17-@xmath16 ) may arise , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the octet and decuplet baryon states in this study .",
    ", width=249 ]    although the cbm framework differs from the covariant spectator quark model for the treatment of the valence quarks , the cbm can be used as an effective description of the long - range physics of meson cloud dressing . the possible conflict between the two models",
    "e.g. , the lack of the explicit covariance and the limitation of the applicability for the large @xmath5 region in the cbm , can be overcome in a proper manner , since one can define a covariant extension of the model based on covariant parametrizations for the meson cloud contributions that are equivalent with the cbm result at @xmath0 .",
    "see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite , where meson cloud contributions were estimated in different reactions . in addition , the merit of using the cbm is that the model is based on su(3 ) ( su(6 ) flavor - spin ) symmetry and chiral symmetry .",
    "the explicit calculation of the meson cloud contributions considered in this study requires two kind of mechanisms .",
    "the first mechanism is the photon coupling with the meson , and for this , we use a formalism similar to that applied in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , in the present study we take into account the explicit dependence of the baryon and meson ( pion , kaon and eta ) masses . [",
    "previously , we used su(3 ) symmetry for the baryon masses , and only the pion cloud was included . ]",
    "the second mechanism is the photon coupling with the intermediate baryon states , which is more delicate and model dependent , since this requires an estimate of all the intermediate octet - octet , octet - decuplet decuplet - octet and decuplet - decuplet transition form factors at @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding expressions are derived in the cbm framework , but since we describe the valence quark cores with the covariant spectator quark model , it is necessary to reinterpret the cbm quark magnetic moments in terms of those calculated by the spectator quark model .",
    "this will be done using su(3 ) symmetry to be explained in detail later .",
    "finally , the results from the cbm are normalized by the pion cloud contribution obtained in the covariant spectator quark model for the @xmath12 transition  @xcite , under the assumption that the pion cloud is the dominant meson cloud contribution . with this procedure also used in the previous work  @xcite , we preserve the parametrization of the covariant spectator quark model for the core , and estimate the effects of the meson cloud for the other octet to decuplet transitions , as well as the kaon and eta clouds for the @xmath12 reaction .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ secformalism ] we explain the decomposition of the valence and meson cloud contributions for the transition form factors . in sec .",
    "[ secvalence ] we review the formalism associated with the valence quark contributions for the form factors , and express the results in terms of _ effective _ quark magnetic moments , which are also necessary for the calculation of the meson cloud effects . in sec .",

    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "[ secresults ] , while the final conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ secconclusions ] .",
    "next , we discuss briefly the formalism necessary to describe the valence quark contributions , as well as the mechanism of the meson cloud dressing .    in the covariant spectator quark model ,",
    "baryons are treated as three - quark systems  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic interactions with the baryons are described by the photon coupling with the constituent quarks in the relativistic impulse approximation , and the quark electromagnetic structure is represented in terms of the quark form factors parameterized by a vector meson dominance mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the parametrization of the quark current , calibrated previously in the studies of the nucleon form factors  @xcite and by the lattice qcd data for the decuplet baryons  @xcite , encodes effectively the gluon and quark - antiquark substructure of the constituent quarks .",
    "the baryon wave functions derived from the su(6)@xmath18o(3 ) structure , are written in terms of an off - shell quark , that is free to interact with the photon fields , and two on - shell quarks . integrating over the quark - pair degrees of freedom , we reduce the three - quark baryon state to a quark - diquark state , where the diquark can be represented as an on - shell spectator particle with an effective mass of @xmath19  @xcite .    under the assumption that each baryon system can be described by the wave function with an s - state configuration for the quark - diquark system in the first approximation , we calculated the valence quark contributions for the magnetic form factors @xmath20 in the previous work  @xcite , where the upper index @xmath7 labels the contributions from the quark core ( bare ) , using the wave functions from refs .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details . )",
    "contributions from the electric and coulomb quadrupole form factors appear only beyond the s - state approximation for the decuplet baryon wave functions .",
    "however , their contributions are expected to be small ( small orbital angular momentum admixtures )  @xcite , and thus they are neglected in this work .    as mentioned already ,",
    "the constituent quarks considered in this work , have internal structure , and the structure is encoded in a vector meson dominance parametrization  @xcite , that includes effectively , among other effects , the meson cloud dressing of the quarks .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that there are meson cloud effects that can not be included in the constituent quark structure , such as the process of meson exchange between the different quarks inside the baryon , which can not be reduced to a simple diagram of a quark dressing .",
    "processes of this kind , have to be represented at the hadronic level ( meson and baryon states ) as the diagrams shown in fig .  [ figmesoncloud ] .",
    "thus , the meson cloud in this study , is regarded as a process of one meson exchange between the different quarks inside the baryon  @xcite . since the meson cloud dressing",
    "can appear in two independent mechanisms ( self dressing of the quarks and the others ) there is no double counting . in summary , besides the contributions from the valence quark core calculated using the quark electromagnetic form factors , there are meson cloud effects that have to be taken into account in the electromagnetic transitions between the baryon states .",
    "those meson cloud effects are the main focus of the present work .",
    "from the discussions made previously , we conclude that the magnetic transition form factors ( @xmath21 ) can be represented as the sum of the valence quark ( @xmath20 ) and meson cloud ( @xmath22 ) contributions in the present approach : @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , for the study of the baryon decuplet decay widths , we need to consider only the case @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we can write g_m(0)= g_m^b(0 ) + g_m^mc(0 ) .",
    "as mentioned already , the meson cloud contribution for the octet to decuplet transition , can be decomposed in the two processes displayed in fig .",
    "[ figmesoncloud ] , for the first and second order , classified by the number of the baryon propagators .",
    "the diagram ( a ) represents the direct coupling of a photon with the intermediate state meson ( first order , one baryon propagator ) .",
    "the diagram ( b ) represents the direct coupling of a photon with the intermediate state baryons ( second order , two baryon propagators ) .",
    "one can then decompose @xmath24 into the contributions from the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) : g_m^mc(0)=g_m^mca(0 ) + g_m^mcb(0 ) .",
    "the meson cloud contributions corresponding to each diagram ( a ) and ( b ) , can be further decomposed into the pion , kaon , and eta cloud contributions .    as in the previous work  @xcite , in order to keep the parametrization of the covariant spectator quark model , we regularize the results for the pion cloud contribution by that from the covariant spectator quark model for the @xmath12 reaction , g_m^mc ( 0 ) = 3 _ , where @xmath25 defines the strength of the pion cloud effect  @xcite . in this procedure",
    "we assume that the pion cloud is the dominant meson cloud effect in the @xmath12 reaction .",
    "later we will see that this assumption is indeed justified .",
    "for the other octet to decuplet transition reactions , and also for all the meson clouds considered in the present work , we use the relation , g_m^mc ( 0 ) = f_bb ( 3 _ ) , [ eqfbbp ] where the factor @xmath26 contains the pion , kaon and eta meson cloud contributions from the both diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ figmesoncloud ] .",
    "the calculation of the coefficient @xmath26 will be explained in sec .",
    "[ secresults ] .",
    "the diagram ( b ) includes in the intermediate states , the octet - octet , octet - decuplet , decuplet - octet and decuplet - decuplet baryon electromagnetic transitions .",
    "therefore , to estimate the contributions from the possible intermediate baryon state transitions , we need to calculate all the corresponding transition magnetic form factors at @xmath27 .",
    "one can in principle calculate them in the covariant spectator quark models for this purpose , however , the explicit estimates corresponding to all the intermediate baryon state transitions would be complex and tedious .",
    "therefore , for the diagram ( b ) we use the estimate made in the cbm / su(6 ) framework , where all the intermediate state contributions can be related with the valence quark magnetic moments . in order to relate the cbm / su(6 ) quark magnetic moments with the anomalous magnetic moments in the covariant spectator quark model , we will start by reviewing the expressions used for the valence quark contributions for the octet to decuplet electromagnetic transition form factors .",
    "in the covariant spectator quark model the valence quark contributions for the form factors are calculated using the octet and decuplet baryon wave functions , and the constituent quark current .",
    "the quark current has the general form  @xcite , j_q^(q^2 ) = j_1(q^2 ) ^+ j_2(q^2 ) , where @xmath28 @xmath29 are the quark form factors that can be parametrized in terms of a vector dominance mechanism .",
    "the form factors @xmath28 can also be decomposed in the quark - isoscalar , quark - isovector and strange - quark components .",
    "the details can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , but are not important for the present discussion , since we are considering the @xmath0 case , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the last equation defines the quark anomalous moment ( @xmath32 ) in the covariant spectator quark model formalism .    to calculate the transition form factors , we project the operator @xmath28 on the mixed anti - symmetric ( @xmath33 ) and mixed symmetric ( @xmath34 ) components of the octet and ( fully symmetric ) decuplet @xmath35 flavor states : & & j_i^a= 3 , + & & j_i^s= 3 .",
    "more details can be found in refs .",
    "note that , for the octet to decuplet baryon transitions only the components @xmath36 ( isovector ) are relevant . finally , the magnetic form factor can be written  @xcite as , g_m^b = |f_v i , [ eqgm0 ] with |f_v = \\ { + } , [ eqfv ] where the coefficients @xmath37 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath38 is the overlap integral between the octet ( @xmath39 ) and decuplet ( @xmath40 ) radial wave functions ( see details also in ref .",
    "the radial wave functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are scalar functions of the baryon and diquark momenta  @xcite . in eqs .",
    "( [ eqgm0 ] ) and  ( [ eqfv ] ) @xmath20 , @xmath41 and @xmath38 are exclusive functions of @xmath5 .",
