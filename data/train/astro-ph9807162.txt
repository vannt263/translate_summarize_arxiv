    "determining the distances to the galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) is a difficult but important task .",
    "the in - depth study of the remnants has depended largely on observations in the radio regime . however , radio telescope surveys searching for snrs are biased by three selection effects : i ) overlooking snrs due to their low surface brightness , especially in a region of higher background , ii ) failure to detect snrs due to their small angular size and iii ) an absence of uniform coverage of the sky ( see also green 1991 ) .",
    "recent observations of snrs have been performed with radio telescopes with better sensitivities , higher angular resolutions and more complete sky coverage than the previous generations , as well as with space - based x - ray telescopes .",
    "the use of these new instruments has led to the discovery of new snrs with lower surface brightnesses and smaller angular sizes , resulting in a significant increase in the number of known snrs .",
    "it has also led to a better determination of the physical and observational properties of known remnants .",
    "however , most snrs still do not have well determined distances .",
    "conventionally , snrs are classified into three basic types : shell remnants , characterized by diffuse , shell - like emission with steep radio spectra ; plerionic or filled - center remnants , containing a central source with a flat radio spectrum but no shell structure ; and composite remnants , which show signs of both a central source and a diffuse shell structure .",
    "distances to the snrs can be inferred from positional coincidences with , , and molecular clouds , ob associations or pulsars or from measuring optical velocities and proper motions . where there is no direct distance determination , estimates can be made for shell remnants by utilizing the radio surface brightness to diameter relationship ( @xmath4 ) ( i.e. clark & caswell 1976 ; milne 1979 ;",
    "sakhibov & smirnov 1982 ) .",
    "the mean surface brightness at a specific radio frequency , @xmath7 , is a distance independent parameter and , to a first approximation , is an intrinsic property of the snr ( shklovsky 1960 ) .",
    "if this relationship is given by @xmath8 the distance @xmath9 will be proportional to @xmath10 , or , in terms of observable quantities , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the flux density at the observing frequency @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the angular diameter of the remnant .",
    "composite snrs may be characterized by a similar relation , but only a few have known distances , and hence a reasonable @xmath4 relation is difficult to calculate for them .",
    "there exists considerable skepticism about using the @xmath4 relation to obtain distance estimates ( e.g. green 1984 , 1991 ) .",
    "green ( 1984 ) pointed out two significant problems with the @xmath4 relation .",
    "first , many of the independently determined distances have a degree of uncertainty .",
    "absorption measurements can be difficult to interpret and often give reliably only lower distance limits .",
    "associations of snrs with other objects such as molecular clouds , emission regions and ob associations can not always be made with great confidence .",
    "second , studies of snrs in the large magellanic cloud , which are all at approximately the same known distance , have shown a spread in intrinsic properties ( see discussion in green 1984 ) .",
    "this suggests that for a given surface brightness , there may be a spread in linear diameters , making a unique distance estimate to individual remnants difficult and uncertain .",
    "this spread in intrinsic properties likely results from the variety of different environments into which the remnants are evolving .",
    "the density and structure of the ambient medium and the lingering effects of the snr progenitor star could all potentially effect the remnant s evolution ( allakhverdiyev et al .",
    "1983a , 1983b ) .",
    "however , in snr samples which are thought to be observationally complete , there is a clear trend for the surface brightness of snrs to decrease with increasing linear diameter . by using a large number of distance ` calibrators ' with distance measurements as reliable as possible ,",
    "a @xmath4 relation can be constructed and distance estimates can be made to shell remnants for which there is no other distance information available .",
    "however , investigators who use distances to individual snrs based upon the @xmath4 relation must be aware of the inherent uncertainties and assumptions of this method .",
    "the impetus for this work arose from a need to determine the radial galactic snr distribution .",
    "the @xmath4 relation was the only means by which distances could be obtained for most of the known shell snrs .",
    "however , it became apparent that the @xmath4 relations most often quoted for distance estimates ( e.g. clark & caswell 1976 ; milne 1979 ) needed to be updated in light of the new information available for snrs .",
    "we show that even with the uncertainties involved in estimating distances to _ individual _ snrs , it is possible to use the @xmath4 relation for examining _",
    "ensemble _ properties of the snrs , such as the total number and their radial distribution . in this paper , revised distances",
    "are given for all snrs in green s snr catalogue ( green 1996a ) for which previous information is out - dated or new information is available .",
    "these kinematic distances were recalculated when necessary using a more modern rotation curve ( with @xmath15 kpc and @xmath16 km / s ) .",
    "other distances were taken from new pulsar - snr or molecular cloud - snr associations . a new @xmath4 relation for shell type snrs",
    "is presented using a sample of 36 ` calibrators ' ( 37 including cas a ) and the assumptions and limitations for the use of the @xmath4 relation are discussed .",
    "the surface brightness distribution of the nearby remnants and a monte carlo simulation are used to calculate scale factors in an attempt to compensate for observational selection effects .",
    "these results are used to derive the radial snr surface density distribution in the galaxy .",
    "the positional coincidences of galactic snrs with , , and molecular clouds , ob associations or pulsars may provide distance estimates to the remnants .",
    "however , of the 215 snrs in green s present catalog ( august 1996 version ) , only 64 have independently determined distances ( 38 of 160 shell type , 5 of 9 filled center , 18 of 31 composite and 3 of 15 unknown type ) . in this analysis , any shell remnant which has an associated pulsar , regardless of whether or not any kind of radio plerion is observed , is considered a composite .",
    "therefore , the number of shell and composite type snrs given here differs from the numbers in green s catalogue .",
    "using a number of known diameters ( from the shell remnants with established distances ) one can derive a @xmath4 relationship for a given radio frequency . for those shell - type remnants which have no direct distance information , we can then estimate their distances using this relation .",
    "unless stated otherwise , the flux densities and surface brightnesses used in this analysis are referenced to 1 ghz .",
    "previous @xmath4 relations have indicated that the power law index @xmath17 in eq . 1 lies in the range @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "clark & caswell ( 1976 ) used 20 snrs ( 14 shell , 2 filled center , 2 composite , 1 of unknown type , 1 no longer regarded as an snr ) as distance calibrators and found @xmath20 in the surface brightness range @xmath21 w m@xmath22 hz@xmath23 ( they suggested @xmath24 for @xmath25 ) .",
    "this surface brightness limitation excluded the three brightest remnants including cas a. they also excluded rcw 103 , for which they had what they considered a reliable distance , but was far away from their fit in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "in addition , 9 of the 20 calibrators had only lower limits on the distance , and the lower limit was taken to be the actual distance .",
    "milne ( 1979 ) used the 11 snrs from clark & caswell with known distances , added back the four remnants that had been excluded and added 7 more with known distances for a total of 22 snrs ( 18 shell , 3 composite , and 1 filled center ) and obtained @xmath26 .",
    "lozinskaya ( 1981 ) used 21 of the 22 snrs ( excluding the crab ) in milne s list , with revised distances to three of them , and added 5 others who s distances she had determined from optical observations for a total of 26 ( 22 shell and 4 composite ) and found @xmath27 , roughly half way between the values given by clark & caswell and milne .",
    "sakhibov & smirnov ( 1982 ) used 38 snrs ( including those from lozinskaya ) that they classify as shell - type ( but actually includes at least 4 remnants that we classify as composite ) out of a larger sample of 57 calibrators of all types to derive @xmath28 , agreeing closely with lozinskaya and , within their error , with clark & caswell and milne as well . for their larger sample",
    "they obtain @xmath29 .",
    "li & wheeler ( 1984 ) have derived the flattest relation for shell snrs with @xmath30 .",
    "huang & thaddeus ( 1985 ) attempted to use a more homogeneous subsample consisting of 12 shell snrs located near large molecular clouds and found @xmath31 .",
    "however , all of these studies used old rotation curves .",

    "for distances estimated by associating the remnant with an object such as an ob association , co cloud or region , the distance to the object may be fairly well determined , but the association itself may be less certain , making an error estimate difficult . in these cases , we do not incorporate the snr into table  [ shell ] unless there is at least one other corroborating distance estimate .",

    "huang & thaddeus ( 1985 ) suggested using a subsample of snrs that are evolving into similar environments to reduce the scatter in the @xmath4 relation .",
    "they used 12 snrs ( including cas a and w44 , which we consider a composite ) situated near molecular cloud complexes and determined distances to the remnants by using the optical distances to regions or ob associations associated with the cloud or from co emission from the cloud itself . the @xmath4 relation",

    "huang and thaddeus excluded one remnant ( hb 9 ) simply because it lay too far off their @xmath4 fit . if we use a more recent distance estimate to hb 9 ( see table  [ distances ] ) and then include it in the fit , we obtain @xmath91 for the 13 snrs . excluding the composite remnant w44 , leaving 12 shell snrs , does not significantly change the fit parameters .",

    "the completeness factor is fairly constant at @xmath157 until @xmath158 kpc , after which the completeness factor begins to drop off , justifying our assumption of observational completeness out to 3 kpc ( see fig .",
    "[ sb_dist ] ) .",
    "completeness factors , @xmath159 , which are the inverse of the area - weighted average scale factors only for the zero bins , can also be estimated to reflect the level incompleteness due to zero bins .",
    "for the entire near half of the galaxy ( see fig .  [ distrib ] ) , @xmath160 for @xmath161 w m@xmath22 hz@xmath23 sr@xmath23 . for the region within 3 kpc of the sun , @xmath162 .    the bins , corrected for selection effects ,",
    "are combined into three broad regions in azimuth .",
    "these regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ distrib ] .",
    "the apparent absence of snrs in the outer portion of region 3 is probably real , due to the outer spiral arms ending before reaching this region .",
    "the bins in each region are combined further in azimuth to obtain a single radial profile for that region and converted to surface densities .",
    "when 1 kpc radial bins were used , peaks in the radial distribution show a rough correspondence to the positions of the spiral arms . in order to get an estimate of the errors in the shell snr surface densities due to the uncertainty in the @xmath4 relation ,",
    "a monte carlo simulation was used , taking the fractional errors of fig  [ frac_err ] into account , in order to obtain bootstrapped errors .",
    "the errors in the densities are typically @xmath163 in the mid - regions of the galaxy ( @xmath164 kpc ) and considerably higher ( up to 75% ) in the regions of low statistics ( @xmath165 kpc , @xmath166 kpc ) .",
    "the scale factors can not compensate for bins where no snrs are observed , and therefore observational incompleteness is still a problem for regions 1 and 3 , where the completeness factors are lower .",
    "the scaled total number of shell snrs in region 2 is @xmath167 , where the error on the number of snrs represents the uncertainty in the @xmath4 relation and @xmath159 represents the incompleteness due to the lack of selection effects compensation for the zero bins . for region 2 , @xmath168 . if region 2 is considered representative of the entire galaxy , then the total number of shell remnants for @xmath169 kpc and @xmath161",
    "w m@xmath22 hz@xmath23 sr@xmath23 is estimated to be @xmath170 .",
    "the monte carlo simulation shows that this estimate is not very sensitive to the uncertainty in the @xmath4 relation .",
    "= 6.5 in    a weighted fit of the shell snr surface density distribution in region 2 , normalized to the surface density at the solar circle , was performed using the functional form employed by stecker & jones ( 1977 ) , @xmath171 where @xmath172 kpc is the sun - galactic center distance .",
    "we find that @xmath173 and @xmath174 ; the radial scale length of the distribution is @xmath175 kpc .",
    "the shape of the distribution is similar to that obtained by kodiara ( 1974 ) .",
    "the two distributions are shown in figure  [ radial]a .",
    "equation 14 implies that the surface density is zero at @xmath176 .",
    "however , our data suggest that the surface density is not zero near the galactic center .",
    "therefore , we have used the following functional form to obtain a weighted fit to the unnormalized surface density distribution : @xmath177 where @xmath178 kpc@xmath22 , @xmath179 kpc , @xmath180 and @xmath181 kpc@xmath23 .",
    "this fit is valid for @xmath182 , i.e. 16.8 kpc ; @xmath183 beyond that .",
    "the data and fit are shown in figure  [ radial]b .",
    "the scale length of 7.0 kpc is consistent with that determined by previous studies .",
    "green ( 1996b ) used a simple model with snrs distributed as a gaussian in galactic radius and compared the resulting longitudinal distribution to the observed snr longitudinal distribution , obtaining a scale length of @xmath184 kpc .",
    "however , no attempt was made to compensate for selection effects other than to use a @xmath41-limited sample .",
    "li et al . (",
    "1991 ) used a more sophisticated model distributing snrs in an exponential disk as well as in spiral arms .",
    "they incorporated a 1/@xmath185 selection bias , assuming completeness out to @xmath186 kpc .",
    "they then compared the longitudinal distribution given by the model with the observed snr longitudinal distribution , obtaining a scale length of @xmath187 kpc , depending on the model parameters .",
    "as li et al . point out , the scale length of the galactic stellar disk is @xmath188 kpc , suggesting that the snr scale length , as derived in this work and by green ( 1996b ) and li et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , would indicate that the snr distribution is not associated with the stellar disk population .",
    "the catalogue of known snrs has continued to grow in size . the number of snrs with reasonably determined distances has also increased .",
    "however , most distances given in the literature were calculated using older rotation curves .",
    "we have recalculated the distances , where necessary , using a modern rotation curve , and used the updated distances to derive a new @xmath4 relation for shell snrs .",
    "this @xmath4 relation , using a sample of 36 shell snrs ( 37 including cas a ) , yields a slope of @xmath189 excluding cas a and @xmath190 with cas a. when the 41 shell snrs in the lmc and smc are added to the sample , the slope is @xmath191 with a smaller error . using the @xmath4 relation to estimate distances to individual remnants is viable only with the assumptions that all shell snrs have the same radio luminosity dependence on linear diameter , the same supernova explosion mechanism and energy , and are evolving into identical environments . we find that , on average , the error in the distance estimation to an individual snr to be @xmath192 when using our @xmath4 relation .",
    "however , the error in deriving ensemble characteristics of snrs such as the snr surface density can be lower ( @xmath193 for the mid - galactic region ) .",
    "we attempt to compensate for observational selection effects inherent in snr searches by employing a scaling method based on the sensitivity , angular resolution , and sky coverage of actual radio surveys . utilizing the updated distances ,",
    "the new @xmath4 relation and the scale factors , the shell snr surface density radial distribution was derived .",
    "the distribution peaks at @xmath188 kpc and has a scale length of @xmath194 kpc .",
