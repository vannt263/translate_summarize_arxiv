    "hl tau is a class i  ii protostellar source located in the northern part of the l1551 region in the taurus molecular cloud at a distance of @xmath1140 pc @xcite .",
    "it is still embedded in a protostellar envelope with a size of @xmath13000 au and surrounded by a circumstellar disk with a size of @xmath1100 au @xcite .",
    "previous interferometric observations have found infalling motion in the protostellar envelope @xcite .",
    "in addition , jets and bipolar outflows launched from this protostellar source have also been observed at optical and infrared wavelengths and in molecular lines @xcite .",
    "the presence of the infall and the outflow implies that hl tau is still in the active mass accretion phase .",
    "recent observations of the millimeter and submillimeter continuum emission with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) at high angular resolutions of @xmath1003007 , corresponding to a physical size of @xmath1510 au , discovered a series of ringlike gaps in the disk around hl tau @xcite .",
    "the presence of the gaps suggests the depletion of material or the variation of dust properties at these radii .",
    "it is considered as hints of forming planets in the disk .",
    "therefore , hl tau becomes a promising candidate of ongoing planet formation .",
    "subsequent theoretical studies to understand the origin of the ringlike structures predict the presence of multiple , sub - jovian mass ( @xmath2 ) planets in the disk @xcite .",
    "the other studies claim that gravitational instabilities @xcite , pebble growths @xcite , or dust aggregates @xcite can explain the observed features .",
    "a direct search for planetary bodies in the gaps in the disk around hl tau has been performed with imaging observations in @xmath3 band .",
    "no planet was found , and the observations put the upper limits on the planet mass to be 1015 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , the information on the gas component , the major mass content in the disk , in these gaps of the millimeter continuum emission remains unclear .",
    "even though the hco@xmath0 ( 10 ) emission , tracing the gas component in the disk around hl tau , is also detected at standard - of - rest velocities ( @xmath4 ) of 212 km s@xmath5 in the alma observations , its image was generated at a lower angular resolution of @xmath1025 , corresponding to 35 au , because of the limited signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio @xcite .",
    "this hco@xmath0 ( 10 ) image indeed clearly shows the keplerian rotation of the disk @xcite , but its resolution is too coarse to identify the counterparts of these continuum gaps in the image . in this letter",
    ", we report the radial intensity profiles and reconstructed intensity map of the hco@xmath0 ( 10 ) emission in the disk around hl tau at a high angular resolution of @xmath1007 , revealing the counterparts of the continuum gaps in the gas component .",
    "the hl tau data analyzed here were retrieved from the public data release of the alma science verification observations ( project code : 2011.0.00015.sv ) .",
    "the details of the observations have been described by @xcite .",
    "we retrieved the 3 mm continuum image directly from the alma data archive , while re - generated the hco@xmath0 ( 10 ; 89.188526 ghz ) and co ( 10 ; 115.271202 ghz ) image cubes at higher angular resolutions than those presented by @xcite .",
    "our hco@xmath0 and co image cubes were generated by fourier - transforming their calibrated visibility data at a velocity resolution of 0.4 km s@xmath5 with the briggs robustness parameter of @xmath6 and without tapering , using the tasks in common astronomy software applications ( casa ) .",
    "we did not perform self - calibration on their visibility data because self - calibration did not improve their s / n ratios , as demonstrated by @xcite . because the co image cube was used to derive the temperature profile",
    ", we did not perform the continuum subtraction on its visibility data , as explained below , while the hco@xmath0 data were continuum subtracted using the casa task _ uvcontsub_. because there is no clear detection above s / n ratios of 3 in the image cubes , no `` clean '' was performed .",
    "the angular resolutions of the hco@xmath0 and co images are @xmath101 @xmath7 005 and @xmath1007 @xmath7 004 , respectively , and their noise levels are @xmath12 and @xmath16 mjy beam@xmath5 per channel .",
    "because there is no clear detection at a s / n ratio @xmath8 3 in our high - resolution hco@xmath0 image cube , we performed azimuthal averaging on the image cube to enhance the s / n ratio and to measure its radial intensity profile .",
    "the disk around hl tau is inclined by 47@xmath9 from the plane of the sky , and its major axis has a position angle of 138@xmath9 from north to east @xcite .",
    "these angles were adopted to correct the projection of the disk on the plane of the sky , and the de - projected radius of each pixel was computed .",
    "the size of each radial bin for azimuthal averaging was adopted to be the half of the beam size ( @xmath10035 or @xmath15 au ) . to minimize the confusion from the foreground or background molecular clouds and the associated outflows @xcite , only the pixels within @xmath1045@xmath11 of the major axis",
    "were included in azimuthal averaging , where the velocities are blueshifted and redshifted away from the systemic velocity because of the rotation of the disk .",
    "then we obtained the azimuthally averaged hco@xmath0 spectrum at each radial bin .",
    "the averaged spectra at representative radii are presented in figure [ spec ] .",
    "the spectra at several radii show a negative dip centered at @xmath4 @xmath1 67 km s@xmath5 , which has also been seen in the spectrum at the low angular resolution @xcite .",
    "that can be due to absorption by foreground clouds or the outflow associated with hl tau .",
    "we integrated the spectrum over @xmath4 of 212 km s@xmath5 to measure the integrated intensity at each radial bin , and the velocity channels showing absorption ( red histograms in figure [ spec ] ) and those having values within the @xmath101@xmath12 noise level were excluded when we measured the integrated intensity .",
    "the 1@xmath12 noise level of each averaged spectrum was measured using the line - free channels in that spectrum .",
    "the measured radial profile of the integrated intensity of the hco@xmath0 emission is presented in figure [ ir]a .",
    "the uncertainty of the integrated intensity at each radial bin was estimated as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of channels integrated , @xmath12 is the noise level of the averaged spectrum , and @xmath15 is the velocity width of one channel .    for visualization , we reconstructed the integrated intensity map of the hco@xmath0 emission from its radial intensity profile , assuming the intensity distribution is axisymmetric .",
    "we first computed the de - projected radius of each pixel in the map , and the pixel value was assigned by linear interpolation between the two closest radial bins of the intensity profile .",
    "we note that in the low - resolution hco@xmath0 image @xcite , the distribution of the hco@xmath0 emission is not fully symmetric , and the emission on the northwestern side is brighter than that on the southeastern side . due to the limited s / n ratio in our high - resolution image cube",
    ", the asymmetry of the intensity distribution can not be further investigated .",
    "nevertheless , the hints of the gaps at @xmath130 au and @xmath170 au are seen on the both sides of the disk when we measured the hco@xmath0 intensity profile .",
    "the reconstructed integrated intensity map of the hco@xmath0 emission is presented in figure [ map ] in comparison with the 3 mm continuum image of the hl tau disk , which is obtained with the same alma observations and has a comparable angular resolution @xcite .",
    "our hco@xmath0 intensity map clearly shows two gaps and a cavity at the center .    in our hco@xmath0 results ,",
    "there is no counterpart of the innermost gap at a radius of @xmath113 au and the central emission peak seen in the 3 mm continuum image @xcite . instead , the hco@xmath0 intensity map displays a @xmath110 au wide cavity at the center .",
    "likely , this is at least partially related to the high optical depth of the 3 mm dust continuum emission toward the center .",
    "the continuum - subtracted spectral - line image is essentially biased by features which are anti - correlated with the intensity distribution of the continuum emission . because of the increasing continuum intensity toward the center , we are expecting to see the following effects on the continuum - subtracted hco@xmath0 data , ( 1 ) absorption features at the peak of the continuum emission , ( 2 ) a suppressed contrast between the rings and gaps in the hco@xmath0 intensity , and ( 3 ) a flattening in the hco@xmath0 intensity profile towards the continuum peak ( figure [ ir]a ) .",
    "indeed , the derived radial profile of the hco@xmath0 column density , as shown below , is steeper than its intensity profile ( figure [ ir ] ) , although the overall hco@xmath0 column density profile remains biased by the not as well constrained radial temperature profiles of the dust and the gas .      to estimate the column density of the hco@xmath0 gas",
    ", we assume that the dust grains and the gas are thermally well coupled and have the same temperature , and that the hco@xmath0 gas is thermalized for simplicity . the temperature profile ( @xmath16 )",
    "is adopted to be the radial profile of the brightness temperature of the co emission without continuum subtraction , on the assumption that the co + 3 mm continuum emission is optically thick and traces the temperature structure of the disk .",
    "the radial profiles of the co brightness temperature without continuum subtraction was measured with the same method as that for the hco@xmath0 intensity profile , and is shown in figure [ tr]b . because the bright continuum emission can bias the continuum - subtracted line intensity , we first estimated the radial profile of the optical depth of the 3 mm continuum emission ( @xmath17 ) from its radial intensity profile and the temperature profile using the radiative transfer equation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the brightness temperature of the 3 mm continuum emission and @xmath20 is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( @xmath12.73 k ) . the derived radial profile of the optical depth of the 3 mm continuum emission is shown in figure [ tr]a , and its 1@xmath12 uncertainty was estimated by propagating the uncertainties in @xmath16 and @xmath21 through equation [ tau ] .",
    "the continuum - subtracted brightness temperature of the hco@xmath0 emission ( @xmath22 ) can be described as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the brightness temperature at the frequency of the hco@xmath0 line before the continuum subtraction , and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total optical depth contributed by the 3 mm continuum and the hco@xmath0 line ( @xmath27 ) , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we corrected the effect of the continuum optical depth on the observed hco@xmath0 brightness temperature as @xmath29 and estimated @xmath27 at each radial bin . @xmath16 and @xmath22 were adopted to be the mean brightness temperature of the azimuthally - averaged co and hco@xmath0 spectra within @xmath4 of 212 km s@xmath5 .",
    "then , following the derivation in @xcite , we estimated the hco@xmath0 column density as @xmath30 the derived profile of the hco@xmath0 column density is presented in figure [ ir]c , and its 1@xmath12 uncertainty was estimated by propagating the uncertainties in @xmath22 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 through equation [ tauhcop ] and [ nhcop ] .",
    "the column density profile presented here has radial bins with a size of @xmath10035 ( @xmath15 au ) , which is the half of the beam size , and is azimuthally averaged over @xmath1045@xmath9 of the major axis .",
    "we note that the mm - sized dust grains , which are located closer to the mid - plane , can have a lower temperature than the gas located closer to the disk surface .",
    "if that is the case , the dust temperature is lower than the measured @xmath16 , and then @xmath17 is underestimated .",
    "the derived hco@xmath0 column density becomes higher .",
    "in addition , the absorption in the hco@xmath0 spectra ( figure [ spec ] ) is expected to be more significant at the radii of the continuum bright rings than the continuum gaps , and hence , the hco@xmath0 column density at the radii of the bright rings can be underestimated more than that at the gaps .",
    "these effects can lead to larger depths of the hco@xmath0 gaps than the values estimated in this work .",
    "the overall column density profile can not be well represented by a single power - law function ( fig .",
    "therefore , we treated the inner and outer hco@xmath0 gaps separately to derive their widths and depths . for each gap , we first fitted a power - law function to the column densities only at the radial bins near the gap ( red dashed and dotted lines in figure [ ir]c ) to interpolate the column densities within the gap .",
    "the fitted power - law function was subtracted from the column density profile at those radial bins including the gap .",
    "then we fitted each gap in the residual with a gaussian function , and derived the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of each gap and a column density at the center of each gap .",
    "the contrast in the column density inside and outside the gaps is estimated by comparing the column density at the center of the gaps and that of the fitted power - law function at the same radius ( figure [ ir]c ) .",
    "we repeated this fitting process for a 10,000 times , where each time the radii and densities of the data points are randomly changed within the radial bins and the 1@xmath12 uncertainties , respectively . with this",
    "we obtained the probability distributions of the fitting parameters , and the 10,000 iterations is sufficient to converge .",
    "then we fitted gaussian functions to these probability distributions , and the centers and standard deviations of the fitted gaussian functions were adopted as the best - fit values and the 1@xmath12 uncertainties . with these processes , the hco@xmath0 column density in the inner and outer gaps are estimated to be @xmath1(5@xmath101 ) @xmath7 10@xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath1(1.4@xmath100.4 ) @xmath7",
    "10@xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "both hco@xmath0 gaps have similar fwhm widths of @xmath114@xmath107 au .",
    "assuming the hco@xmath0 abundance does not vary across the gaps , the contrast between the gas density inside and outside the gaps is a factor of @xmath12.4@xmath100.5 and @xmath15.0@xmath101.2 .",
    "the detailed fitting results are listed in table [ gap ] .",
    "the locations of two hco@xmath0 gaps are compared with those of the gaps and bright rings in the milimmeter continuum images ( figure [ ir ] ) .",
    "the inner hco@xmath0 gap is coincident with the continuum gap at a radius of 32.3 au ( d2 gap ; @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer hco@xmath0 gap is located at the bright continuum ring at a radius of 68.8 au ( b5 ring ) , and overlaps with the two continuum gaps at 64.2 au and 73.7 au ( d5 and d6 gaps ; @xcite ) .",
    "our results indicate that the material , including both dust and gas , are depleted at the d2 , d5 , and d6 gaps . by comparing with the gap depths estimated from the continuum data @xcite , the gas gaps are comparable to or shallower than the dust gaps .    hydrodynamical simulations and analytical frameworks have suggested that these gaps can be opened due to tidal interactions with sub - jovian or saturn mass planets @xcite . if these gaps are indeed opened by planets , our estimated gas temperature and the derived depths of the hco@xmath0 gaps lead to planet masses of @xmath10.8 @xmath2 at @xmath128 au and @xmath12.1 @xmath2 at @xmath169 au , following the gap formula @xcite and assuming the viscosity @xmath33 of 0.001 .",
    "these values are larger than those published in the previous works based on the depths of the dust gaps and the dust temperature estimated from the continuum emission @xcite .",
    "gap opening by a planet is currently still unknown for a disk with a vertical temperature gradient ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the gap formula and all the simulations simply assume vertically isothermal disks , but observations suggest cold dust near the disk mid - plane and hot gas above it @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , sub - jovian planetary masses can be obtained when the lower temperatures from these works are adopted in our estimation .",
    "besides the gap depths , the noticeable offset between the d5 and d6 gaps and the outer hco@xmath0 gap may also evidence the presence of a planet .",
    "the b5 ring and the outer hco@xmath0 gap are almost located at the same radius , implying the presence of mm - sized dust at this radius .",
    "the coincidence of the hco@xmath0 gap and b5 ring is explained if the b5 ring corresponds to the horseshoe region of the putative planet @xcite .",
    "hence , the d5 and d6 gaps are offset from the horseshoe region , rather than aligning with the center of the outer hco@xmath0 gap .",
    "in addition , our estimated gas temperature and hco@xmath0 column density may hint at a pressure bump at the outer edge of the outer hco@xmath0 gap , which situates around the bright continuum ring at a radius of @xmath181.3 au ( b6 ring ; @xcite ) . such a pressure bump is normally associated with the outer edge of a planetary gap .",
    "in contrast , the relative position between the inner hco@xmath0 gaps and the d2 gap is less clear due to the limited s / n ratio and the uncertainties in deriving the hco@xmath0 column density .",
    "alternatively , the origin of the outer hco@xmath0 gap can be related to the co snow line without the presence of a planet .",
    "although at a radius of @xmath3460 au , the temperature estimated from our co image cube is @xmath160 k ( fig .  [ tr ] ) , much higher than the co sublimation temperature ( @xmath120 k ) , the co depletion may still occur at the mid - plane , where the temperature can be as low as 20 k , as estimated from the millimeter continuum emission @xcite .",
    "co is a parent molecule of hco@xmath0 , so its depletion can result in the depletion of hco@xmath0 . with the depletion considered , we are expecting to see that the hco@xmath0 column density decreases more rapidly beyond the co snow line without forming a gap . nevertheless , theoretical models suggest that gas can pile up around the snow line due to the transition in the strength of magneto - rotational instability , leading to a density bump @xcite . with alma observations ,",
    "changes in density and properties of dust around the co snow line have been seen in the protoplanetary disk around hd 163296 @xcite . with the combination of these two effects , the hco@xmath0 depletion and the density bump around the snow line",
    ", there is a possibility to form a gap in the hco@xmath0 column density profile .",
    "similar mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of the continuum gaps in the disk around hl tau ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , to examine this scenario , detailed theoretical calculations on the required degrees of the hco@xmath0 depletion and the density bump to reproduce the observed outer hco@xmath0 gap are needed . on the contrary ,",
    "the temperature at the radius of the inner hco@xmath0 gap is most likely much higher than 20 k even at the mid - plane , as estimated from the millimeter continuum emission @xcite .",
    "thus , this scenario is less possible to interpret the presence of the inner hco@xmath0 gap .",
    "there are also other possibilities to create both gas and dust gaps in the disk around hl tau in the absence of multiple planets , such as the variation of dust properties and dust sizes via dust - to - gas feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our observations suggest that the total width of the d5 and d6 gaps ( 23.2 au ; @xcite ) are approximately twice wider than that of the outer hco@xmath0 gap , while the d2 gap has a comparable width ( 11.0 au ; @xcite ) to the inner hco@xmath0 gap . these hint at different gas - dust coupling along the disk radius @xcite .",
    "therefore , more detailed predications of locations , widths , and depths of dust and gas gaps from these models taking account of radial variation of gas - dust coupling is needed to examine these possibilities .",
    "if planet - disk tidal interactions are indeed happening , the inferred epoch of formation of gas giant planets will occur much earlier than the predictions of the standard core accretion model @xcite , therefore calling for modified / alternative formation scenarios @xcite .",
