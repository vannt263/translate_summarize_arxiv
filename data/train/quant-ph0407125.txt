    "unbounded fanout is usually taken for granted in models of classical boolean circuits , even when the fanin of gates is bounded .",
    "they can not be taken for granted in quantum circuits , however , since copying the value of a quantum bit to @xmath8 other bits requires significant nonlocal interactions .",
    "unbounded fanout gates have been shown to be a surprisingly powerful primitive for quantum computation , allowing one to reduce the depth of a circuit computing , say , the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) to essentially constant depth @xcite .",
    "the quantum part of shor s factoring algorithm can thus be implemented in constant depth if unbounded fanout gates are available .",
    "this result about the power of fanout is especially important because in most of the significant proposals for implementing quantum circuits to date , long computations will surely be difficult to maintain due to decoherence , current quantum error correction techniques notwithstanding .",
    "shallow quantum circuits may prove to be , at least in the short term , the only realistic model of feasible quantum computation , and fanout gates would increase their power significantly .    without some quantum gate with unbounded width ( arity ) , it is not clear that any nontrivial decision problem can be computed by @xmath9-depth quantum circuits with bounded error .",
    "this is certainly true if we only allow a one - qubit output measurement ( then the output can only depend on @xmath10 input qubits ",
    "see @xcite for a discussion ) , but it also seems to be true even if we allow a computational - basis measurement of an arbitrary number of qubits at the end @xcite . even if we allow unbounded and gates ( generalized toffoli gates ) , it is not clear what we can do in sublogarithmic depth . we do know that we can not approximate fanout gates this way @xcite . to summarize , fanout gates are an extremely useful , and perhaps necessary , primitive for allowing small - depth quantum circuits to solve useful problems .",
    "furthermore , implementing fanout with a conventional quantum circuit requires logarithmic depth , even if unbounded and gates are allowed .",
    "therefore , implementing a fast fanout gate will require an unconventional approach .",
    "we provide such an approach here by showing that the fanout operator arises easily by evolving qubits via a simple and well - studied hamiltonian , the _ spin - exchange _ or _",
    "interaction , together with a modest amount of encoding and decoding of qubits ( which only requires constant - width gates and constant depth ) .",
    "our results answer positively a question by i. l. chuang , who asked how certain forms of the heisenberg interaction , which are implementable in the laboratory , may be useful for quantum computation @xcite . in particular , we show that the fanout gate on @xmath2 logical qubits can be achieved exactly by encoding them into @xmath1 physical qubits ( each a spin-@xmath11 particle ) , then applying the heisenberg interaction to the encoded qubits .",
    "the interaction need not be isotropic ; both isotropic and nonisotropic versions of the interaction work equally well .    in @xcite",
    ", we showed that a variant of the heisenberg interaction , where the hamiltonian is proportional to the square of the @xmath12-component of the total spin , can implement parity easily ( without encoding ) . when applied to three qubits , this interaction yields an `` inversion on equality gate '' @xmath13 , defined by @xmath14 @xmath13 and single - qubit gates together form a universal set of gates .",
    "recently , implementation of @xmath13 as well as the three - qubit parity and fanout gates in nmr using the above hamiltonian has been reported @xcite .",
    "our current paper affirmatively answers a question left open in @xcite as to whether parity / fanout can be implemented using more common forms of the heisenberg interaction , involving @xmath15- , @xmath16- , and @xmath12-components of the total spin .",
    "in section  [ sec : prelims ] we define the general heisenberg interaction between @xmath2 identical spins , as well as the special case of interest to us . in section  [ sec : heisenberg ] we give an implementation of the @xmath17-bit parity gate , depicted in figure  [ fig : parity - def ] ,    ( 0,0 )    # 1#2#3#4#5 @font    ( 2100,2082)(2251,-2923 ) ( 2701,-1636)(0,0)[b ] ( 3901,-1636)(0,0)[b ] ( 2251,-2236)(0,0)[rb ] ( 4351,-2236)(0,0)[lb ] ( 4351,-2836)(0,0)[lb ] ( 4351,-1036)(0,0)[lb ] ( 2251,-1036)(0,0)[rb ] ( 2251,-2836)(0,0)[rb ] ( 3301,-2836)(0,0)[b ]    where @xmath18 .",
    "the fanout gate arises by placing hadamard gates on each qubit on both sides of the parity gate ( @xmath19 hadamard gates in all ) , and thus implementing parity is equivalent to implementing fanout .",
    "we also show in section  [ sec : compressed ] how different qubit encoding schemes can reduce the ratio @xmath20 to be arbitrarily close to one . in section  [ sec : generalize ] , we generalize our results in two ways : ( 1 ) any hamiltonian whose eigenvalues depend quadratically on the hamming weight of the logical qubits can be used to implement parity , and hence fanout , and ( 2 ) any such hamiltonian can implement generalized @xmath3-gates directly for any @xmath4 .",
    "the heisenberg interaction describes the way particles in the same general location affect each other by the magnetic moments arising from their spin angular momenta . given a system of @xmath21 identical labeled spins described by vector operators @xmath22 , the hamiltonian @xmath23 of the system is a weighted sum of the energies of all the pairwise interactions , plus a term for any external magnetic field ( assumed to be in the @xmath12-direction ) : @xmath24 where the @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constants .",
    "are usually assumed to be positive , appropriate for ferromagnetic interactions which give the lowest energy when spins are aligned in parallel .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is the product of the magnetic field strength and the gyromagnetic ratio for the individual spins ( see @xcite for example ) . ] in this paper , we will show how this interaction can implement fanout in the special case where all the @xmath25 are equal . in this case",
    ", @xmath23 is related to the squared magnitude of the total spin of the system .",
    "we will assume here that physical qubits are implemented as spin-@xmath11 particles , with @xmath27 being the spin - up state ( in the positive @xmath12-direction ) and @xmath28 being the spin - down state ( in the negative @xmath12-direction ) .",
    "given a system of @xmath21 qubits labeled @xmath29 , we define @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the three pauli operators acting on the @xmath34th qubit .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 give the total spin in the @xmath15- , @xmath16- , and @xmath12-directions , respectively .",
    "the squared magnitude of the total spin angular momentum of the system is given by the observable @xmath38 note that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the vector observable giving the spin of the @xmath34th qubit .",
    "it is then clear that , in the absence of an external magnetic field , @xmath41 is linearly related to the energy @xmath23 above .",
    "this is an isotropic heisenberg interaction . to account for an external field in the @xmath12-direction , we define , for any real @xmath26 , @xmath42 this is the case of the heisenberg interaction where all the @xmath25 are unity .",
    "our methods can also accommodate an extra term in the hamiltonian proportional to @xmath43 with no additional effort ( see section  [ sec : heisenberg ] ) , so we consider the more general hamiltonian @xmath44 for any real @xmath26 and @xmath45 such that @xmath46 .",
    "we will evolve the system of @xmath21 qubits using @xmath47 as the hamiltonian .",
    "a related hamiltonian @xmath43 is used in @xcite to implement fanout ; this is an easy case , since each computational basis state is already an eigenstate of @xmath43 and thus the implementation requires no encoding of qubits .",
    "using the current hamiltonian @xmath47 is more complicated and requires encoding logical qubits into groups of physical qubits , so that the tensor product of all the physical qubits encoding a logical basis state will be an eigenstate of @xmath47 .    in the sequel , we choose units so that @xmath48 . if @xmath49 and @xmath50 are both vectors or both operators , we say , `` @xmath51 '' to mean that @xmath52 for some real @xmath53 , that is , @xmath54 up to an overall phase factor .",
    "we use the same notation with individual components of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , meaning that the phase factor is independent of which component we choose . if @xmath55 is a bit vector , we let @xmath56 denote the hamming weight of @xmath15 , that is , the number of @xmath57s in @xmath15 .",
    "the properties of the @xmath58-operators are well - known .",
    "see , for example , bhm @xcite .",
    "we will review the essential ones here .",
    "the commutation relations are @xmath59 = ij_z$ ] , and likewise for the two other cyclic shifts of the indices .",
    "@xmath41 commutes with @xmath37 , so one may choose an orthonormal basis of the @xmath2-qubit hilbert space @xmath5 that diagonalizes both simultaneously .",
    "eigenstates of @xmath41 and @xmath37 are traditionally labeled as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 both integers .",
    "we have @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the extra parameter @xmath67 is used to give distinct labels to different basis vectors in degenerate eigenspaces of @xmath41 and @xmath37 .",
    "these basis vectors can be chosen so that , for any value @xmath67 that appears as the third label of some basis vector , the basis vectors labeled by @xmath67 span an irreducible spin representation , that is , a minimal subspace of @xmath5 invariant under the action of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "this space will be spanned by the basis vectors @xmath68 , for some @xmath69 depending only on the label @xmath67 , and is called a spin-@xmath70 representation .",
    "letting @xmath71 and @xmath72 be the usual raising and lowering operators , respectively , we may adjust the phases of the basis vectors so that @xmath73 ( this sets the relative phases of states within the representation , but still allows the overall phase of the representation to be adjusted relative to other representations . )      an important fact that we will use later is that for each @xmath70 , there are exactly @xmath74 many spin-@xmath70 representations in the decomposition of @xmath5 . then @xmath75 .",
    "] one way to see this is as follows .",
    "for any @xmath76 such that @xmath77 is an integer , let @xmath78 be the eigenspace of @xmath37 with eigenvalue @xmath70 ( if @xmath79 , then @xmath78 has dimension zero ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath80 , since @xmath78 is spanned by all the computational basis vectors with hamming weight @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath81 operator maps @xmath78 into @xmath82 , and so its kernel on @xmath78 has dimension at least @xmath83 , given above . now",
    "the space @xmath84 is spanned by the set of all states of the form @xmath85 , so there are no less than @xmath86 distinct values for @xmath67 occuring in the set , and each one labels a distinct spin-@xmath70 representation .",
    "finally , since each spin-@xmath70 representation has dimension @xmath87 for all @xmath70 , and since @xmath5 has @xmath88 dimensions , a simple counting argument shows that there can be no more than @xmath86 many spin-@xmath70 representations , either .",
    "it follows that there are a total of @xmath89 many spin representations in the decomposition of @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath2 is even , then it is easy to show that the representations are evenly split between those where @xmath90 is even and those where @xmath90 is odd : @xmath91 representations for each .",
    "this fact will be used in section  [ sec : compressed ] .",
    "finally , we mention how some of the spin states relate to computational basis states .",
    "there is one spin-@xmath92 representation in the decomposition , namely , the completely symmetric representation , which is spanned by the states @xmath93 for integer @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "( this equation sets the overall phase of the spin-@xmath92 representation . ) a key point in this paper is to note that @xmath96 is a tensor product of single qubits .",
    "this means that some spin states involve little or no entanglement among qubits and thus can be prepared using only reasonably local interactions . more generally , suppose we group some of the @xmath2 qubits into disjoint pairs @xmath97 for some @xmath98 ( that is , @xmath99 and are all pairwise distinct ) , then we form a state @xmath100 by putting each pair @xmath101 of qubits into the singlet state @xmath102 and each of the rest of the ( unpaired ) qubits into the @xmath27 state , i.e. , @xmath103 where @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the set of all unpaired qubits .",
    "then it is easy to check that @xmath100 is an eigenstate of @xmath37 ( with eigenvalue @xmath106 ) and is in @xmath107 .",
    "it follows that @xmath100 is also an eigenstate of @xmath41 , because @xmath108 .",
    "many of the states @xmath85 where @xmath104 can be defined this way , but not all  different choices of the @xmath109 pairs do not always produce states that are orthogonal to each other , or even linearly independent .",
    "recall the hamiltonian @xmath47 of ( [ eqn : general - hamiltonian ] ) on the space @xmath5 of @xmath2 qubits labeled @xmath110 .",
    "@xmath47 commutes with @xmath41 , so it has eigenvectors @xmath60 with respective eigenvalues @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath112 be a vector of @xmath113 bits , where @xmath113 is some number no greater than @xmath2 .",
    "we wish to encode the @xmath113-qubit computational basis state @xmath114 into an @xmath2-qubit eigenstate @xmath60 of @xmath47 so that @xmath70 depends linearly on @xmath56 , and we want to do this by using gates that act on as few qubits as possible .",
    "the easiest way to accomplish this is to have @xmath115 and create encoded states of the form given by ( [ eqn : pairing ] ) .",
