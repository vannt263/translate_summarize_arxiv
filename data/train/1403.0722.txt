    "of all x - ray techniques , single crystal diffraction with a monochromatic beam offers by far the highest resolution , the strongest absolute signal , and the best signal to noise ratio .",
    "it is therefore the method of choice for the examination of small crystallographic changes ( such as magneto - elastic effects ) , and for weak signals ( such as magnetic scattering or scattering of orbital order ) .",
    "unlike x - ray diffraction techniques such as white beam laue diffraction or powder diffraction , however , this technique requires precise alignment of the sample and is therefore sensitive to vibrations that might be introduced by electromagnetic forces induced by the field pulse .",
    "it requires optical access over a wide angular range to enable measurements at high scattering angles .    in many cases",
    "the magnetic field induced effects are anisotropic and require the application of the field along a specific crystallographic axis .",
    "the challenge of combining x - ray single crystal diffraction and pulsed high magnetic fields was taken up by several groups over the world during the last ten years @xcite .    with this specific aim ,",
    "the simplest way to obtain a coil with large optical access in the mid plane perpendicular to the magnetic field is to use two coils , series connected and axially aligned , with a gap between them . in this arrangement , commonly called split - pair magnet , the vertical axial bore is used to insert the sample cryostat , and the horizontal mid plane gap is used for x - ray access . over the years , several pulsed magnets of split - pair type @xcite have been developed to meet the requirements for combining x - ray diffraction with high pulsed magnetic field .",
    "however , only very few publications @xcite have shown the difficulties to associate both techniques and the efforts required to reduce the pulse induced vibrations , and to make x - ray single crystal diffraction compatible with pulsed magnetic field .    here , a new pulsed field set - up , including a split - pair magnet and sample cryostat , both specifically designed and optimized for single crystal measurements on a synchrotron x - ray beamline , is presented .",
    "particular efforts have been carried out to quantify the vibrations .",
    "several technical changes have been made on the pulsed magnet and cryogenic assembly by the lncmi - toulouse ( lncmi - t ) and on the beamline at the esrf - grenoble , to minimize the vibrations and their propagation .",
    "this device offers the possibility to invert the magnetic field polarization and to change the sample temperature over a wide range while optimally cooling the coil . after a detailed description of the different parts of the system we present its main features as regards of field , temperature and angular resolution , illustrated by first results obtained on a fe@xmath4te single crystal .",
    "the split - coil magnet described here was designed and built at the lncmi - t .",
    "it is composed of two coils consisting of 36 layers of 13 turns .",
    "the wire choice was the result of a trade - off between low resistivity to reduce coil heating and high ultimate tensile stress ( uts ) to resist to magnetic pressure .",
    "a copper conductor , internally reinforced by niobium titanium filaments and insulated with kapton , was used .",

    "stainless steel spacers were inserted between both magnets to withstand the pressure ( @xmath11 200  mpa ) resulting from attraction induced by lorentz forces on the two coils .",
    "these spacers were designed with @xmath12 open sectors for x - ray beam access alternating with @xmath13 closed sectors ( see fig .",
    "[ split3dview ] ) . a thin layer of teflon and 2@xmath14 of glass fiber epoxy composite ( fr4/g10 ) were added between the coils and the spacers to increase electrical insulation and internal mechanical reinforcement .            with an inner diameter of 22@xmath14 , an outer diameter of 200@xmath14 , a height of 50@xmath14 per coil and a gap of 20@xmath14 ,",
    "the total height of the split - pair magnet is 120@xmath14 and the resulting inductance @xmath15 . at the center of the magnet ,",
    "the vertical length available for the sample is of @xmath16 and the vertical angular opening of each open sectors is of @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "[ splitcoil ] ) .",
    "this split - pair magnet was designed to generate a maximum field of 30@xmath0 at the sample position .",
    "this design goal was achieved as the final coil reached a field of 31@xmath0 in user operation .",
    "the cryogenic system consists of a liquid nitrogen ( ln2 ) bath cryostat that houses the coils , and a separate liquid @xmath18he cryostat for the sample .",
    "the split - pair magnet was integrated into a custom designed nitrogen cryostat equipped with twelve x - ray transparent , vacuum tight kapton windows ( foils of 120@xmath19 thickness ) .",
    "the latter are distributed around the dewar ( fig .",
    "[ splitmounting ] ) , matching the @xmath12 optical access sectors in the spacers between the magnets .",
    "the internal vessel of this cryostat is divided in two parts ( the lower and upper baths ) , each containing a coil ( fig .",

    "this configuration allows the use of a common vacuum for the nitrogen cryostat , the helium insert and the x - ray beam path .",
    "the coil / ln2 cryostat assembly hosts a top loading @xmath18he cryostat allowing measurements in the temperature range 1.5  250  k.        as shown on figures  [ cryo3d ] and [ hecryostat ] , the @xmath18he cryostat consists of five parts : the main bath ( tank 1 ) , a 2.5@xmath1 heat exchanger , the 1.5@xmath1 bath ( tank 2 ) with its extension , the sample loading tube system and the sample zone .",
    "the main bath ( tank 1 ) is a 3l liquid helium vessel .",
    "it is connected with the 1.5@xmath1 bath ( tank 2 , 0.4l ) via a tube of 2@xmath14 inner diameter equipped with a cold valve .",
    "when open , the valve allows refilling of tank 2 with liquid @xmath18he from the main bath while , when closed , tank 1 can be refilled with almost no effect on the temperature of tank 2 .",
    "the latter is extended by a vertical stainless steel tube of 15@xmath14 outer diameter ( the `` cryostat s tube extension '' ) equipped with a joule heater and a cernox calibrated thermometer .",
    "the cryostat includes also a 2.5@xmath1 heat exchanger pumped by an independent pumping line .",
    "this exchanger is continuously supplied with liquid helium coming from the tank 1 and includes in its lower part a joule thomson ( j - t ) impedance ( capillary of 10@xmath20 length and 0.15@xmath14 inner diameter ) allowing the expansion of the helium gas and , therefore , the cooling of the vapors in the inner part of the exchanger down to 2.5@xmath1 . in closed cycle mode , the he flow is injected through a long capillary ( stainless steel tube of 1.2@xmath21 length and 1@xmath14 inner diameter ) , wound inside the exhaust line of the tank 1 , traversing the tank 1 and the exchanger before entering in the upper part of the tank 2 .",
    "the flow is then distributed via two needle valves in two different lines .",
    "the first valve allows to regulate the temperature between 4 and 250 k , the line being wound around the joule heater s support located in the lower part of the cryostat s tube extension .",
    "the second valve allows to reach temperatures as low as 1.5@xmath1 , this line being extended by a long and thin capillary ( 1@xmath21 length and 0.5@xmath14 inner diameter ) twisted inside the cryostat s tube extension and ending with a final impedance ( capillary of 5@xmath20 length and 0.15@xmath14 inner diameter ) .",

    "the sample zone is located at the center of the magnetic field .",
    "it consists of a capsule of 800@xmath19 thick torlon , a polymer fairly transparent to x - ray , glued ( stycast 2850  ft ) to the bottom end of the sample loading tube .",
    "a brass foil tube , radially drilled and thermally anchored to the cryostat tube extension , surrounds the capsule and is covered with several layers of super insulation to screen against the thermal radiation from the kapton windows at room temperature .",
    "the sample zone and the loading tube were designed to be easily evacuated , then loaded with a few @xmath22 of @xmath18he exchange gas at room temperature and pressure . in operation the external surface of the loading tube is in direct contact with the liquid @xmath18he of the cryostat tube extension while its internal surface is in contact with the exchange gas .",
    "the sample is thus cooled down by exchange gas to the bath temperature .    to mechanically decouple the @xmath18he insert from the magnet and ln2 cryostat , and to allow fine adjustment of the @xmath18he cryostat s tube extension inside the vacuum enclosure , an additional external support system ( fig .  [ cryo3d ] )",

    "_ ]    finally , a sample handling system has been designed specifically to prevent sample motion ( rotation and/or translation of sample holder ) induced by field pulses .",
    "it consists of the sample holder coupled with the capsule located at the bottom of the @xmath18he insert .",
    "both parts are made in torlon , thus avoiding induced currents in the sample holder .",
    "the upper parts of both elements have a conical shape ( see fig .  [ sampleholder ] ) allowing to physically lock the sample holder inside the @xmath18he cryostat after alignment of the sample in bragg condition .",
    "the stability of the sample orientation is thus ensured over time .",
    "the sample handling system is complemented with a measurement stick which is equipped with a pick - up coil and a heating resistance .",
    "to improve thermal conductivity , a thin sapphire plate ( thickness  @xmath23 ) covers the part of the sample holder where the sample is glued with ge varnish .",
    "all the cryogenic environment has been custom designed and built at the lncmi - t .",
    "the split - pair magnet was used with a 24@xmath24 , 1.15@xmath2 transportable pulsed field generator developed by the lncmi - t .",
    "this generator consists of two identical storage units and one control unit .",
    "each storage unit contains eight high energy density capacitors of 250@xmath25 each , resulting in a total capacitance of 4@xmath26 , two crowbar resistors ( @xmath27 ) and two inductive current limiters ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the control unit houses the charger , thyristor stack , dump resistors , the current and voltage monitors .",
    "this unit is also equipped with high - voltage , high - current pneumatically driven commutators to give the possibility to work with two polarities .",
    "commutation and charging take only a few minutes and is controlled completely by a computer integrated in the central control unit .",
    "the energy of the capacitor bank is released into the coil through an optically triggered thyristor switch .",
    "the bank is protected from failure in case of a short in one capacitor .",
    "to avoid an electrical dump of all the other capacitors into the defective one , they are all equipped with industrial hv - fuses .",
    "the three subunits are mounted in individual steel frames so that they can be transported using a fork lift or an overhead crane .",
    "each storage module weighs approximately 2000@xmath29 and has dimensions ( @xmath30 ) @xmath31 .",
    "the control unit is slightly smaller ( @xmath32 ) and weighs only 800@xmath29 .",
    "the connections between the three subunits are made on external patch panels and do not require opening of the units enclosures .",
    "the generator can thus be safely installed by users with minimal training . for our synchrotron experiments , the generator , located outside the experimental hutch ,",
    "was linked to the personal safety system ( pss ) of the radiation hutch such that it could be charged only after the hutch had been searched and interlocked .",
    "the coil parameters as measured during coil testing were : a resistance value @xmath33 and 1650@xmath34 at 77 and 300@xmath1 , respectively , an inductance @xmath15 and a field factor of 169.2@xmath35 .",
    "maximum magnetic field of 31@xmath0 was achieved at the center of the split - pair magnet for a charging voltage of @xmath36 .",
    "the pulse duration was of 60@xmath3 with a rise time of 16.5@xmath3 , as shown on figure  [ btracesnew ] . with more than 4.5@xmath3 above 98% of the maximum field value , this pulse is relatively long compared to the other pulsed field devices developed for x - ray and neutron scattering experiments @xcite . in addition , the magnetic field produced at the center of the magnet is fully homogeneous over typical size of single crystals probed by x - ray ( i.e. , from hundreds of micrometers to one or two millimeters ) with less than 1% of variation over @xmath373@xmath14 along the bore of the magnet and less than 0.5% radially ( over a radius @xmath38 ) .",
    "the energy stored into the coil at maximum field value is relatively high ( @xmath39 ) and at the end of the pulse its electrical resistance shows an increase of about @xmath40 equivalent to a coil heating of 40@xmath1 .",
    "around half an hour is then required between two pulses at 31@xmath0 to return to the coil operating temperature of 90@xmath1 .",
    "the cryogenic performances have been tested successively in open cycle and closed cycle mode .",

    "incident x - ray energy was @xmath47 ( @xmath48 0.3995 ) . _ _ ]    the tests were first carried out on silicon single crystals to estimate the vibration amplitude of the complete device .",
    "the diffracted intensities were measured with a silicon photodiode mounted on the detector arm of the diffractometer and recorded ( along with generator voltage and current , and the voltage on a pick - up coil on the sample stick ) during the field pulses on a digital data recorder ( hioki memory hicorder model 8860 ) .",
    "motorized slits upstream of the photodiode detector at 70@xmath20 from the sample position were used to adjust the longitudinal ( @xmath49 ) resolution .",
    "due to the very narrow rocking curve width of the silicon crystal and the low divergence of the incident x - ray beam this configuration is extremely sensitive to rotations of the sample during the field pulse .",
    "one main source of vibrations identified on the beamline was eddy currents propagating in the aluminium parts of the diffractometer . to increase the distance from the field center to those parts and suppress the repulsive forces generated by induced currents ,",
    "several aluminium parts such as the goniometer top plate and rotation stages ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 stages ) of the diffractometer were removed and replaced by fiber glass spacers ( fr4/g10 ) .",
    "the remaining aluminium parts were thus located at more than 49@xmath20 from the center of the magnet . induced eddy currents and corresponding forces were sufficiently weak to not disturb the measurement anymore .    as an example , the evolution of the normalized intensity of a si ( 800 ) bragg reflection ( fwhm(@xmath52)@xmath53 ) is shown on figure  [ intandrotnewc ] ( left ) as a function of time for different amplitudes of field pulses : 14 , 21 and 31@xmath0 . the intensity begins to oscillate 9@xmath3 after the magnetic field pulse was triggered .",
    "however , the variation of intensity does not exceed 17% during the first half of the pulse ( i.e.  up to 28@xmath3 after the beginning of the pulse ) .",
    "then , between 28 and 60@xmath3 , the amplitude of the oscillation increases , with the intensity even going through zero for the 31@xmath0 pulse .",
    "the orientation of the sample is nevertheless maintained since the intensity is recovered with no more oscillation 1@xmath54 after the pulse ( not shown ) .    by measuring the change of intensity at",
    "slightly lower or higher sample angles ( @xmath52 ) than the bragg position , it was possible to ascribe the loss of intensity to sample rotation .",
    "the latter was easily calculated as a function of time based on the full width at half maximum of the reflection and pseudo - voigt like shape of bragg peaks .",
    "the result is displayed on figure  [ intandrotnewc ] ( right ) .",
    "these curves show that sample rotation is always lower than @xmath55 during the first half of the pulse and does not exceed @xmath56 at maximum field , well below the mosaicity of most single crystal samples of interest for high - field studies ( e.g.  @xmath57 for typical intermetallic compounds ) . in the second half of the pulse ,",
    "the rotation is as high as @xmath58 for the shot at maximum field value .",
    "this means that our experimental setup is not suitable for studying intensity changes over the entire field pulse for very high quality samples with mosaicity below @xmath59 .",
    "one should note , however , that the usable pulse length is at least five times higher than the one provided by the other pulsed field devices dedicated to x - ray single crystal diffraction experiments @xcite .",
    "this is of advantage for studying metallic samples and hysteresis effects .",
    "furthermore , the longer rise time induces less sample heating due to induced currents .",
    "other efforts have been carried out to further suppress or reduce vibrations , but they yielded no significant improvement , e.g. decoupling the coil cryostat from the diffractometer and sample cryostat by means of viscoelastic absorbers , and increasing the stiffness of the diffractometer by means of external reinforcements .    while simple , cheap and easy to use , a point detector such as a photodiode requires at least one magnetic field pulse per scattering angle , and is thus not exactly very efficient for studies of magnetic field induced crystallographic phase transitions . on the other hand , a fast 2d detector can follow the evolution of bragg peaks during magnetic field pulses @xcite , i.e. it allows the observations of intensity changes at several scattering angles simultaneously . in our first experiments a maxipix detector @xcite was used .",
    "this is a fast readout , active pixel detector based on the medipix2 @xcite and timepix @xcite readout chips developed by cern and the medipix2 collaboration .",
    "the system achieves up to 1.4@xmath60 frame rate with 290@xmath61 minimum readout dead time and has a pixel size of @xmath62 .",
    "we used the single chip ( @xmath63 pixels ) detection geometry . in this geometry , with the detector mounted on the detector arm ( @xmath64-arm ) of the diffractometer at a distance of 53@xmath20 from the sample , the accessible angular width in both the vertical and horizontal direction is around @xmath37@xmath65@xmath66 , and the angular resolution corresponding to the pixel size is approximately 0.006@xmath66 in 2@xmath52 .",
    "the resolution could be increased by increasing the distance to the sample , e.g. to 0.0037@xmath66 at 85@xmath20 from the sample .",

    "this behavior was observed for all temperatures in the range @xmath86  50@xmath1 , the critical field required to completely detwin the crystal increasing when temperature decreases .    figure  [ fete_h_t]-bottom shows the time dependence of the integrated intensities of the ( 400)/(040 ) pair of reflections measured at @xmath83  1.6@xmath1 when a 31@xmath0 magnetic field pulse was applied . only slight oscillations are visible , both peaks keeping their intensity during all the pulse .",

    "below t@xmath8758@xmath1 , the tetragonal ( 400 ) splits in the ( 400)/(040 ) pair of reflections because of the monoclinic distortion . during the magnetic field pulse ( between 0 and 60@xmath3 ) , there is nearly no evolution of the integrated intensity indicating a quite good sample stability with regard to the beam . _ _ ]    above the nel temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fete_h_t ] , middle ) no evolution of the integrated intensity of the different bragg peaks measured was detected as a function of time ( and therefore as a function of field ) , clearly indicating a quite good sample stability with regard to the beam during a pulse .",
    "this first experiment thus shows that applying high magnetic field results in magneto - crystalline domain selection in fe@xmath4te .",
    "this behavior can be directly followed during the entire magnetic field pulse thanks to the multi - frame acquisition mode allowed by the fast two - dimensional pixel detector associated with the pulsed field set - up developed for single crystal x - ray diffraction .",
    "this promising results open the door to the investigation of the @xmath88-@xmath89 phase diagram of this material in the limits offered by our experimental set - up .",
    "in summary , we have constructed a split - pair magnet implemented in a novel cryogenic environment to perform high field single crystal x - ray diffraction measurements at synchrotron sources .",
    "this new device offers a panoramic access to x - rays allowing measurements at any scattering angle .",
    "it provides magnetic fields up to 31@xmath0 with a long pulse duration ( rise time of 16.5@xmath3 ) , which is of great advantage for studying metallic samples and hysteretic effects .",
    "furthermore , a temperature as low as 1.5@xmath1 can be maintained on the sample for more than ten hours using the closed cycle mode of the @xmath18he cryostat inserted into the bore of the magnet .    during the commissioning of this apparatus ,",
    "particular attention was given to the problem of field - pulse induced vibrations of the sample .",
    "we succeeded to limit the sample rotation induced by magnetic field pulse to @xmath90 during the first half of the pulse .",
    "this rotation is well below the mosaicity of most single crystal samples of interest for high field studies .",
    "combined with a fast two - dimensional pixel detector adapted to the time structure of the field pulse , it offers the possibility to follow the intensity changes of several bragg peaks at different scattering angles simultaneously and throughout the whole duration of the pulse .",
    "improvements could be carried out on the duty cycle of the experiment by incorporating ln2 cooling channels in the design of the coil .",
    "this will decrease the cooling time of the coil but this will come at the expense of the maximal field or will require higher energy .    this device offers the opportunity to investigate small crystallographic changes , such as magneto - elastic effects , field induced symmetry breaking or charge order that could occur in strongly correlated electrons systems like , e.g. , high @xmath91 superconductors , quantum spin systems or heavy fermions materials .",
