    "stellar flares are defined as rapid brightenings of emission across the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite , typically followed by an exponential relaxation back to the quiescent state of a star .",
    "it is assumed that such brightenings are caused by the release of magnetic energy , which is stored near active regions in the stellar photosphere .",
    "our sun shows flares with typical energies of @xmath8erg @xcite .",
    "a study of the spectral content of solar flares @xcite indicates that the optical part of the spectrum can be well approximated by a black body radiation with @xmath9k .",
    "a variety of stars show flares with energies @xmath10 times that of the largest known solar event ( @xmath11erg ) , that are therefore called `` superflares '' @xcite .",
    "it is expected that superflares occur more frequently on magnetically active k- and m - type dwarfs , which are mostly fast rotators and partly full convective @xcite .",
    "nevertheless there is a small number of stars , presumably like the sun , that show superflares .",
    "these stars are on or near the main sequence , have spectral types f8-g8 with corresponding temperatures @xmath12k@xmath13k , and are not young .",
    "a study of all the suitable stars within the kepler input catalogue ( kic ) @xcite shows that the fraction of superflare stars among such `` solar like '' stars is about @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this value must be treated with care , since flares can also be caused by close binary interaction , wide late - type companions or other scenarios .",
    "if such superflare stars are really solar twins , one might conclude upon the frequency and energetics of superflares on the sun .",
    "solar superflares with energies above @xmath4erg could be harmful to the biosphere and also very relevant for space weather .",
    "it was discussed recently whether the ad 774/5 @xmath15c event was due to a solar superflare @xcite . since the activity of the sun as known from historic sunspot and aurora observations is known only for up to 2 - 3 millennia , the rate of solar superflares is also not well - known . in intcal @xmath16 data ,",
    "there were three large spikes within the last @xmath17yr @xcite , but their origin is not known .",
    "better constraints can be obtained from the rate of superflares of many sun - like stars .    in this work we reanalyzed the light curves of two interesting superflare stars , kic10524994 and kic07133671 , found by @xcite , that have the highest flare energies within the subsample of presumably sun - like stars with temperatures @xmath18k@xmath19k , and probably long rotational periods ( @xmath20d ) .",
    "we investigated the origin of the superflares directly from kepler photometry ( sec .",

    "2.5 ) and indirectly from the occurrence times of the detected flares ( sec .",
    "additionally we characterized all detected flares regarding their energies and luminosities ( sec .",
    "2.4 ) , determined a power law for the frequency of superflares @xmath21erg ( sec . 2.6 ) and we estimated the ages of the stars for a comparison with the sun ( sec .",
    "we used the multimission archive at space telescope science institute to retrieve the light curve and target pixel files ( tpf ) for each quarter .",
    "the light curve files contain exposure times , aperture photometry fluxes ( sap ) with photometric errors and fluxes corrected for pointing errors , focus changes and thermal effects ( pdc - sap ) @xcite . in the tpfs ,",
    "pixel data are presented as a time - series of photometrically calibrated images , while the pixels are assigned either to the optimal aperture or a halo around it @xcite .",

    "only 3 quarters could be gathered from the archive in the case of kic07133671 .",
    "if we are visually looking at the quarterly light curves of kic 10524994 ( fig .",
    "[ curves_1 ] ) , most of them show quasi - periodic brightness variations with an irregular modulation in amplitude of up to @xmath22mmag .",
    "a simple estimation shows that the averaged amplitude of these variations can be explained by stellar spots that have a slightly different temperature than the photosphere ( fig .",
    "[ spots ] ) .",
    "if one considers similar spot temperatures as those for the sun , which means @xmath23k for umbrae @xcite , a single spot would cover about 4@xmath24 of the visible hemisphere , * which is a realistic scenario*. in contrast to binary eclipses with an expected constant amplitude , stellar spots can be variable regarding their spot size and temperature , while new spots can be generated at other longitudes and latitudes , hence one can explain the observed phase jumps ( due to differential rotation ) and amplitude shifts .    although the hypothesis of binary - eclipses can not be ruled out for sure , we assume that the frequency of the most dominant light curve variation corresponds to the rotational period of the star .",
    "we used the lomb - scargle method ( lsp ) to calculate the spectral content of the signal .",
    "rotational periods were estimated from the mean of a gaussian shape , which was fitted to the highest peak of the power spectrum .",
    "we then compared the results of lsp with the results from computing the  string length \" @xcite .",
    "we normalized the magnitudes ( @xmath25 ) and transformed all times into phases ( @xmath26 ) that correspond to a particular period .",
    "we used the period for which the sum of the lengths of line segments between neighbouring points ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) is minimized as the true period .    from the lomb - scargle - periodogram we got a period of @xmath27d for kic10524994 ( fig .",

    "[ kurvenfaltung ] one can rule out some hypotheses : if the shape were be caused by eclipses of a binary , the disappearance of phases with constant flux would categorize the companion as a giant , hence it would dominate the spectral class of the system .",
    "an eclipsing binary in the background can be responsible for the amplitude , but it can not explain the brightness modulation in the different quarters and it is less realistic that such an amplitude is created by star spots of a single background star .",
    "the sinusoidal like light curve shape supports the hypothesis of large star spots on the stellar surface of kic10524994 but nevertheless , the possibility of an unresolved binary or a combination of both eclipses and stellar spots remains .    *",
