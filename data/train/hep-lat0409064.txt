    "since the pion is the goldstone boson of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , observables related to the pion give insight into the chiral dynamics of qcd .",
    "for example the pion scattering length is a parameter entering the effective chiral lagrangian of qcd and a precise determination of this observable in an ab - initio lattice calculation is desirable . on the lattice scattering data of stable particles can be calculated using lscher s formula @xcite which relates the scattering length to the energy @xmath2 of the scattering state .",
    "the crucial technical challenge is a very precise determination of @xmath2 and advanced strategies for error reduction have to be used . for chirally sensitive quantities , such as the pion scattering length ,",
    "it is important to be able to work with small pion masses . using fermions based on the ginsparg - wilson equation it is now possible to reach pion masses much lower than what was accessible with more traditional formulations .",
    "this implies that the chiral extrapolation of the results to the physical pion mass becomes more reliable .",
    "our calculation is based on the chirally improved ( ci ) dirac operator @xcite .",
    "ci fermions are a systematic approximation of a solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation and have been tested successfully @xcite in spectroscopy down to pion masses of @xmath3  mev .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 2 . our final results for @xmath4 compared to experimental data and to 2-loop chiral perturbation theory .",
