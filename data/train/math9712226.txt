    "it was known to euclid that two plane polygons of the same area are related by scissors congruence : one can always cut one of them up into polygonal pieces that can be re - assembled to give the other . in the 19th century",
    "the analogous result was proved with euclidean geometry replaced by 2dimensional hyperbolic geometry or 2dimensional spherical geometry .    the 3rd problem in hilbert s famous 1900 congress address @xcite posed the analogous question for 3dimensional euclidean geometry : are two euclidean polytopes of the same volume `` scissors congruent",
    ", '' that is , can one be cut into subpolytopes that can be re - assembled to give the other .",
    "hilbert made clear that he expected a negative answer .",
    "one reason for the nineteenth century interest in this question was the interest in a sound foundation for the concepts of area and volume . by `` equal area '' euclid _ meant _ scissors congruent , and the attempt in euclid s book xii to provide the same approach for 3dimensional euclidean volume involved what was called an `` exhaustion argument ''",
    " essentially a continuity assumption  that mathematicians of the nineteenth century were uncomfortable with ( by hilbert s time mostly for aesthetic reasons ) .",

    "dehn defined a new invariant of scissors congrence , now called the _ dehn invariant _ , which can be formulated as a map @xmath13 , where the tensor product is a tensor product of @xmath2modules ( in this case the same as tensor product as @xmath14vector spaces ) .",

    "we define the _ dehn invariant _ @xmath18 as @xmath19 we then extend this linearly to a homomorphism on @xmath3 .",
    "it is an easy but instructive exercise to verify that    * @xmath20 is well - defined on @xmath3 , that is , it is compatible with scissors congruence ; * @xmath20 and @xmath21 are independent on @xmath3 in the sense that their kernels generate @xmath3 ( whence @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) ; * the image of @xmath20 is uncountable .    in particular",

    "this answer to hilbert s problem is really just a start .",
    "it immediately raises other questions :    * are volume and dehn invariant sufficient to classify polytopes up to scissors congruence ? * what about other dimensions ? * what about other geometries ?",
    "the answer to the first question is `` yes . ''",
    "sydler proved in 1965 that @xmath25 is injective .",

    "fundamental questions remain open about @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "note that the definition of dehn invariant applies with no change to @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the dehn invariant should be thought of as an `` elementary '' invariant , since it is defined in terms of 1dimensional measure .",
    "for this reason ( and other reasons that will become clear later ) we are particularly interested in the kernel of dehn invariant , so we will abbreviate it : for @xmath30 @xmath31    in terms of this notation sydler s theorem that volume and dehn invariant classify scissors congruence for @xmath7 can be reformulated : @xmath32 it is believed that volume and dehn invariant classify scissors congruence also for hyperbolic and spherical geometry :    [ sufficiency ] @xmath33 is injective and @xmath34 is injective",
    ".    on the other hand @xmath35 is also surjective , but this results from the existence of similarity transformations in euclidean space , which do not exist in hyperbolic or spherical geometry .",
    "in fact , dupont @xcite proved :    @xmath33 and @xmath34 have countable image .",
    "thus the dehn invariant sufficiency conjecture would imply :    [ rigidity ] @xmath36 and @xmath37 are countable .",

    "[ image of volume ] the subgroups @xmath38 and @xmath39 of @xmath40 are @xmath14vector subspaces of countable dimension .      many generalizations of hilbert s problem have been considered , see eg @xcite for an overview .",
    "there are generalizations of dehn invariant to all dimensions and the analog of the dehn invariant sufficiency conjectures have often been made in greater generality , see eg @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the particular dehn invariant that we are discussing here is a codimension 2 dehn invariant .",
    "conjecture [ sufficiency ] appears in various other guises in the literature .",
    "for example , as we shall see , the @xmath41 case is equivalent to a conjecture about rational relations among special values of the dilogarithm function which includes as a very special case a conjecture of milnor @xcite about rational linear relations among values of the dilogarithm at roots of unity .",
    "conventional wisdom is that even this very special case is a very difficult conjecture which is unlikely to be resolved in the forseeable future .",
    "in fact , dehn invariant sufficiency would imply the ranks of the vector spaces of volumes in corollary [ image of volume ] are infinite , but at present these ranks are not even proved to be greater than 1 . even worse : although it is believed that the volumes in question are always irrational , it is not known if a single one of them is !    as we describe later , work of bloch , dupont , parry , sah , wagoner , and suslin connects the dehn invariant kernels with algebraic @xmath0theory of @xmath1 , and the above conjectures are then equivalent to standard conjectures in algebraic @xmath0theory .",
    "in particular , the scissors congruence rigidity conjectures for @xmath42 and @xmath43 are together equivalent to the rigidity conjecture for @xmath44 , which can be formulated that @xmath45 ( indecomposable part of quillen s @xmath46 ) is countable .",
    "this conjecture is probably much easier than the dehn invariant sufficiency conjecture .",
    "the conjecture about rational relations among special values of the dilogarithm has been broadly generalized to polylogarithms of all degrees by zagier ( section 10 of @xcite ) .",
    "the connections between scissors congruence and algebraic @xmath0theory have been generalised to higher dimensions , in part conjecturally , by goncharov @xcite .",
    "we will return to some of these issues later .",
    "we also refer the reader to the very attractive exposition in @xcite of these connnections in dimension 3 .",

    "thurston s geometrization conjecture , much of which is proven to be true , asserts that , up to a certain kind of canonical decomposition , 3manifolds have geometric structures .",
    "these geometric structures belong to eight different geometries , but seven of these lead to manifolds that are describable in terms of surface topology and are very easily classified .",
    "the eighth geometry is hyperbolic geometry @xmath41 .",
    "thus if one accepts the geometrization conjecture then the central issue in understanding 3manifolds is to understand hyperbolic 3manifolds .",
    "suppose therefore that @xmath47 is a hyperbolic 3manifold .",
    "we will always assume @xmath48 is oriented and for the moment we will also assume @xmath48 is compact , though we will be able to relax this assumption later .",
    "we can subdivide @xmath48 into small geodesic tetrahedra , and then the sum of these tetrahedra represents a class @xmath49 which is an invariant of @xmath48 .",
    "we call this the _ scissors congruence class of @xmath48_.    note that when we apply the dehn invariant to @xmath50 the contributions coming from each edge @xmath15 of the triangulation sum to @xmath51 which is zero in @xmath52 .",
    "thus    the scissors congruence class @xmath50 lies in @xmath36 .",
    "how useful is this invariant of @xmath48 ?",
    "we can immediately see that it is non - trivial , since at least it detects volume of @xmath48 : @xmath53 now it was suggested by thurston in @xcite that the volume of hyperbolic 3manifolds should have some close relationship with another geometric invariant , the chern ",
    "simons invariant @xmath54 .",
    "a precise analytic relationship was then conjectured in @xcite and proved in @xcite ( a new proof follows from the work discussed here , see @xcite ) .",
    "we will not discuss the definition of this invariant here ( it is an invariant of compact riemmanian manifolds , see @xcite , which was extended also to non - compact finite volume hyperbolic 3manifolds by meyerhoff @xcite ) .",
    "it suffices for the present discussion to know that for a finite volume hyperbolic 3manifold @xmath48 the chern ",
    "simons invariant lies in @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , the combination @xmath56 turns out to have good analytic properties and is therefore a natural `` complexification '' of volume for hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "given this intimate relationship between volume and chern  simons invariant , it becomes natural to ask if @xmath57 is also detected by @xmath50 .",
    "the answer , unfortunately , is an easy `` no . ''",
    "the point is that @xmath57 is an orientation sensitive invariant : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 means @xmath48 with reversed orientation .",
    "but , as gerling pointed out in a letter to gauss on 15 april 1844 : scissors congruence can not see orientation because any polytope is scissors congruent to its mirror image tetrahedra occur in @xmath60 mirror image pairs . ] . thus @xmath61 and",
    "there is no hope of @xmath57 being computable from @xmath50 .",
    "this raises the question :    [ question1 ] is there some way to repair the orientation insensitivity of scissors congruence and thus capture chern ",
    "simons invariant ?",
    "the answer to this question is `` yes '' and lies in the so called `` bloch group , '' which was invented for entirely different purposes by bloch ( it was put in final form by wigner and suslin ) . to explain this we start with a result of dupont and sah @xcite about ideal polytopes  hyperbolic polytopes whose vertices are at infinity ( such polytopes exist in hyperbolic geometry , and still have finite volume ) .",
    "[ ideal suffices ] ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra represent elements in @xmath28 and , moreover , @xmath28 is generated by ideal tetrahedra .    to help understand this proposition",
    "observe that if @xmath62 is a non - ideal tetrahedron and @xmath15 is the ideal point at which the extension of edge @xmath63 meets infinity then @xmath62 can be represented as the difference of the two tetrahedra @xmath64 and @xmath65 , each of which have one ideal vertex .",
    "we have thus , in effect , `` pushed '' one vertex off to infinity . in the same way one can push a second and third vertex off to infinity ,  and the fourth , but this is rather harder .",
    "anyway , we will accept this proposition and discuss its consequence for scissors congruence .",
    "the first consequence is a great gain in convenience : a non - ideal tetrahedron needs six real parameters satisfying complicated inequalities to characterise it up to congruence while an ideal tetrahedron can be neatly characterised by a single complex parameter in the upper half plane .",
    "we shall denote the standard compactification of @xmath41 by @xmath66 .",
    "an ideal simplex @xmath67 with vertices @xmath68 is determined up to congruence by the cross - ratio @xmath69=\\frac{(z_3-z_2)(z_4-z_1)}{(z_3-z_1)(z_4-z_2)}.\\ ] ] permuting the vertices by an even ( ie orientation preserving ) permutation replaces @xmath70 by one of @xmath71 the parameter @xmath70 lies in the upper half plane of @xmath1 if the orientation induced by the given ordering of the vertices agrees with the orientation of @xmath41 .",
    "there is another way of describing the cross - ratio parameter @xmath72 $ ] of a simplex .",
    "the group of orientation preserving isometries of @xmath41 fixing the points @xmath73 and @xmath74 is isomorphic to the multiplicative group @xmath75 of nonzero complex numbers .",
    "the element of this @xmath75 that takes @xmath76 to @xmath77 is @xmath70 .",
    "thus the cross - ratio parameter @xmath70 is associated with the edge @xmath78 of the simplex .",
    "the parameter associated in this way with the other two edges @xmath79 and @xmath80 out of @xmath73 are @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively , while the edges @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 have the same parameters @xmath70 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 as their opposite edges .",
    "see figure  1 .",
    "this description makes clear that the dihedral angles at the edges of the simplex are @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 respectively , with opposite edges having the same angle .    .35    figure 1",
    "now suppose we have five points @xmath89 .",
    "any four - tuple of these five points spans an ideal simplex , and the convex hull of these five points decomposes in two ways into such simplices , once into two of them and once into three of them .",
    "we thus get a scissors congruence relation equating the two simplices with the three simplices .",
    "it is often called the `` five - term relation . '' to express it in terms of the cross - ratio parameters it is convenient first to make an orientation convention .",
    "we allow simplices whose vertex ordering does not agree with the orientation of @xmath41 ( so the cross - ratio parameter is in the lower complex half - plane ) but make the convention that this represents the negative element in scissors congruence .",

    "thus we may take the parameter @xmath70 of an ideal simplex to lie in @xmath97 and every such @xmath70 corresponds to an ideal simplex .",
    "one can show that relations ( [ invsim ] ) follow from the five - term relation ( [ 5term ] ) , so we consider the quotient @xmath98 of the free @xmath2module on @xmath97 .",

    "this theorem answers question [ question1 ] .",
    "but there are still two aesthetic problems :    * the bloch regulator @xmath110 plays the rle for orientation sensitive scissors congruence that volume plays for ordinary scissors congruence .",
    "but @xmath21 is defined on the whole scissors congruence group @xmath28 while @xmath110 is only defined on the kernel @xmath107 of complex dehn invariant . *",

    "we describe the bloch regulator map @xmath110 later .",
    "it would be a little messy to describe at present , although its imaginary part ( volume ) has a very nice description in terms of ideal simplices .",
    "indeed , the volume of an ideal simplex with parameter @xmath70 is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the so called `` bloch  wigner dilogarithm function '' given by : @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the classical dilogarithm function .",

    "we need to describe these relations .",
    "using the map of lemma [ cover is flattenings ] , each summand in this relation ( [ 5-term ] ) represents a choice @xmath299 of combinatorial flattening for one of the five ideal simplices . for each edge",
    "@xmath15 connecting two of the points @xmath288 we get a corresponding linear combination @xmath300 of log - parameters ( definition [ flattening ] ) , where we put @xmath301 if the line @xmath15 is not an edge of @xmath289 .",
    "this linear combination has just three non - zero terms corresponding to the three simplices that meet at the edge @xmath15 .",
    "one easily checks that the real part is zero and the imaginary part can be interpreted ( with care about orientations ) as the sum of the `` adjusted angles '' of the three flattened simplices meeting at @xmath15 .",
    "[ geometric five term ] we say that the @xmath302 satisfy the _ flattening condition _ if each of the above linear combinations ( [ edge sums ] ) of log - parameters is equal to zero . that is , the adjusted angle sum of the three simplices meeting at each edge is zero . in this case relation ( [ 5-term ] ) is an instance of the _ lifted five - term relation_.    there are ten edges in question , so the flattening conditions are ten linear relations on the ten integers @xmath303 .",
    "but these equations turn out to be linearly dependant , and the space of solutions is @xmath304dimensional .",
    "for example , if the five parameters @xmath305 are all in the upper half - plane ( one can check that this means @xmath306 is in the upper half - plane and @xmath221 is inside the triangle with vertices @xmath307 ) then the conditions are equivalent to : @xmath308 which express @xmath309 , @xmath310 , @xmath311 , @xmath312 , @xmath313 in terms of @xmath314 , @xmath315 , @xmath316 , @xmath317 , @xmath318 .",

    "the relations we are using are remarkably natural . to explain this we need a beautiful version of the dilogarithm function called the _ rogers dilogarithm _ : @xmath326 the extra @xmath327 is not always included in the definition but it improves the functional equation .",
    "@xmath328 is singular at @xmath139 and @xmath164 and is not well defined on @xmath97 , but it lifts to an analytic function @xmath329 we also consider the map @xmath330 relation ( [ transfer ] ) is clearly a functional equation for both @xmath331 and @xmath332 .",
    "it turns out that the same is true for the lifted five - term relation .",

    "for instance , the triangulations constructed by epstein and penner @xcite in the non - compact case and by thurston @xcite in the compact case are of the appropriate type .",

    "the sum of the flattened ideal simplices then represents @xmath341 up to a @xmath342 correction .",
    "the main part of the flatness conditions on @xmath0 are the conditions that adjusted angles around each edge of @xmath0 sum to zero together with similar conditions on homology classes at the cusps of @xmath48 .",
