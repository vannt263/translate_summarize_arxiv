    ". at @xmath9 galaxy populations in rich clusters are dominated by ellipticals , s0s and at lower masses dwarf ellipticals ( des ) with few , if any , star - forming spirals @xcite .",
    "cluster galaxies have not always been as inactive as they are at the present epoch .",
    "@xcite showed that the fraction of blue ( star - forming ) galaxies among cluster members increases from almost zero in the local universe to @xmath020% by @xmath10 , while recent spitzer / herschel surveys have confirmed large numbers of starburst galaxies in clusters to @xmath11 and beyond ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while some of this rapid evolution of cluster galaxies can be explained by the cosmic @xmath12 decline in star formation among field galaxies since @xmath11 ( e.g. *",
    "* ) , cluster populations have shown an accelerated evolution in star formation ( sf ) over the last four billion years , resulting in an overall @xmath13 reduction in the total star formation rates ( sfrs ) per unit halo mass since @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "empirically , clusters accrete gas - rich , star - forming spirals at @xmath15.51.0 and then contribute to transforming them somehow into the passive s0s and des of local clusters .    several mechanisms affecting the galaxy properties and dependent upon the environment have been proposed and investigated in detail and",
    "all of them serve to kinematically disturb spiral galaxies and/or transform their structural properties and/or deplete their reservoirs of gas , and so quench star formation .",
    "these physical processes include gravitational and tidal interactions amongst galaxies @xcite , between galaxies and the cluster gravitational field @xcite , galaxy mergers @xcite , group - cluster collisions @xcite , ram - pressure @xcite and viscous stripping @xcite , evaporation @xcite and ` starvation ' @xcite .",
    "since these mechanisms are characterized by different time - scales and efficiencies which depend , in turn , on the properties of both the galaxies themselves ( e.g. their stellar masses , morphologies ) and their environment , they can affect the galaxy properties in different characteristic ways @xcite .",
    "examples of this are the different effects of tidal and hydrodynamical interactions . the ram pressure exerted by the hot and dense intracluster medium ( icm )",
    "can effectively remove the cold gas supply , truncating the gas disc and quenching star formation , in massive cluster galaxies passing through the centre of rich clusters in about one crossing time ( @xmath16yr ) , while the interstellar gas of a massive galaxy may never be completely stripped if the galaxy moves on a tangential orbit or is member of a poor cluster .",
    "repeated high - velocity encounters ( harassment ) of cluster galaxies can destroy the fragile disc of dwarf galaxies , but not significantly affect the structure of a giant galaxy .",
    "the development of large spectroscopic surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , plus the availability of panoramic far ultra - violet  far infra - red ( fuv  fir ) data from the _ galex _ and _ spitzer _ space telescopes have allowed the impact of environment on sf to be quantified in unprecedented detail . in these studies , however , the environment and its characteristics are usually treated as ` static parameters ' . while the galaxies move across the cluster , field and filament environments ( experiencing different ram pressures , encountering other galaxies and possibly being involved in merging ) , the cluster potential well , the galaxy density as well as the icm are usually not considered ` time - dependent ' .",
    "of course , at first pass this approach is an unavoidable reduction on complexity .",
    "on the other hand in a hierarchical universe with the assembly of the structures , the galaxies evolve and move , tending towards denser regions with time , while the environments change too , thus what we actually observe is _ galaxy evolution in an evolving environment_.    the most massive structures in the local universe are superclusters , which are still collapsing with galaxy clusters and groups frequently interacting and merging , and where a significant number of galaxies are encountering dense environments for the first time .",
    "the relative dynamical immaturity of superclusters and the presence of infalling dark  matter halos make them ideal laboratories to test the predictions of hierarchical mass assembly models , and in particular on galaxy evolution .",
    "superclusters are not so rare systems in the universe ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the observations of superclusters is often considered a challenge to the hierarchical structure formation paradigm since such extreme dense structures , but also voids , are not reproduced by the @xmath17-body simulations .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the reason of this discrepancy can be due to the method used to assess the probability of finding such events in the distribution of cold matter .",
    "they proposed a new technique to analyse an ensemble of @xmath17-body simulations in a volume equal to that of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ? * ) where the probability to find peculiar structures ( overdense and underdense ) was thus estimated to be @xmath02 per cent and not null .",
    "superclusters allow in principle both to study dynamical processes such as cluster - cluster collisions and group - cluster mergers and to sample different environments from cluster cores to filaments and fields .",
    "furthermore , within a dynamically active and locally dense structure the probability to observe evidence of environmental effects on galaxy evolution is dramatically enhanced making these systems a sort of _ magnifying glass _ to identify the different physical mechanisms which transform the properties of galaxies . in order to address all these aspects , a careful selection of the target",
    "is fundamental .",
    "the ideal structure should map different environments with evidence of cluster - cluster interactions .",
    "finally , in order to study in detail the galaxy properties a resolution @xmath18kpc is required in a wide range of galaxy mass down to the dwarf regime where such galaxies are not quenched by internal processes , but are more susceptible to environmental transformations . with all this in mind , we have undertaken a study of the shapley supercluster which is the largest conglomeration of abell clusters in the local universe .",
    "the shapley supercluster survey ( shass ) will map a 23deg@xmath2 region ( @xmath0 260mpc@xmath19 ) of the shapley supercluster at @xmath20 , containing filaments and embedded galaxy groups which form a dynamically - bound network connecting nine abell and two poor clusters , in order to identify the primary locations ( groups , filaments , clusters ) and mechanisms for the transformation of spirals into the s0s and des .    among the observational studies of superclusters , the stages project @xcite addressed in particular the study of galaxy evolution in the abell901(a ,",
    "b ) supercluster at redshift @xmath210.165 while the orelse survey ( lubin et al .",
    "@xcite , but see also mei et al .",
    "@xcite ) searched for structures on scales greater than 10mpc at higher redshifs ( 0.6@xmath221.3 ) with the aim to investigate the properties of member galaxies .",
    "the comparison between the stages , orelse and other similar studies and shass will be then unavoidable and useful to trace the evolution with redshift , although we notice that the area ( in mpc@xmath2 ) of shass is a factor 10 that of the stages survey and was chosen to map the filaments connecting the abell clusters .",

    "[ sum ] we present the summary and conclusions .    throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath23=0.3 , @xmath24= 0.7 , and h@xmath25=70kms@xmath26mpc@xmath26 . according to this cosmology",
    "1arcsec corresponds to 0.941kpc at @xmath27=0.048 and the distance modulus is 36.66 .",
    "the magnitudes are given in the ab photometric system .",
    "in @xmath28cdm cosmological models structure formation occurs hierarchically , such that the most massive halos corresponding to galaxy clusters form latest , doubling their masses on average since @xmath29 @xcite , and are also the most dynamically immature .",
    "preferentially located at the nodes of the complex filamentary web , clusters are continually accreting dark matter halos containing individual galaxies or galaxy groups . on average , 50% of galaxies in local clusters",
    "have been accreted since @xmath10 @xcite , of which 40% are within groups @xcite .",
    "the process of central galaxies becoming satellites , as their host halos are accreted into more massive halos , has been shown to strongly affect their evolution , with satellite galaxies more likely to be quenched than central galaxies of the same stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "star formation is suppressed within galaxy groups , with the fraction of star - forming galaxies declining steadily with increasing group mass ( at fixed stellar mass ) and proximity to the group centre @xcite .",
    "galaxies which are quenched within such groups and later accreted into clusters are described as having been ` pre - processed ' .",
    "numerical simulations and theoretical studies predict the effect of cluster - cluster mergers on galaxy properties .",
    "@xcite claimed that merging of galaxy clusters may induce sf due to the increase of the external pressure of the icm compressing the cold gas in the cluster galaxies .",
    "this results in a population of starburts or post - starburst galaxies having the same age and so dating the merging event .",
    "the spatial distribution of these star - forming galaxies is expected to differ from the overall distribution of the other cluster galaxies .",
    "similarly , for comparable group and cluster halo densities gravitational shocking as the group enters the cluster could temporarily increases its mass and pull the group members into a denser , more compact system inducing galaxy mergers @xcite",
    ". simulations also showed that starbursts induced by galaxy mergers can be amplified by a factor @xmath30 @xcite if they take place in the tidal field of cluster / group of galaxies .",
    "@xcite studied the excess population of radio galaxies in the cluster a2125 at @xmath27=0.25 , mostly located in groups outside the cluster core and with radio luminosities indicating the sf as the main mechanism responsible of the radio emission .",
    "the authors related this observational evidence with the ongoing major cluster - cluster merger and explained the increased sf as due to the variation of the tidal field experienced by the member galaxies during a cluster - cluster interaction , probably being close to the core passage . studying a system of merging clusters , @xcite observed an excess of star - forming galaxies aligned along the bridge of galaxies connecting a3158 to the a3125/a3128 complex , suggestive of merger - induced sf .",
    "in addition , they found that the fraction of radio - loud sources is lower with respect to a global cluster environment and similar to that measured by @xcite in the cluster a3558 which is considered as an example of a late merger stage .",
    "they suggested that in the cluster cores radio emission from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is suppressed in the late stages of cluster mergers .",
    "the suppressed radio emission observed in both bright and faint cluster galaxies has been also associated to cluster merger by @xcite .",
    "they explained their findings with the disruption of cool cores , i.e. the gas supply to the central agn for the bright galaxies , while the low radio loudness and fainter cluster galaxies have been affected by the enhanced ram pressure when crossing the shock front between the merging clusters .",
    "further observational support of the important role that cluster mergers play in triggering the evolution of cluster galaxies is provided by @xcite studying the merging cluster a2744 .",
    "they identified three rare ` jellyfish ' galaxies located in close proximity to the icm features associated with a merging subcluster and its shock front .",
    "their interpretation is that the sf knots detected in the tails of stripped gas are due to the rapid increase in pressure experienced by the galaxies interacting with the shock .",
    "hence , the observations seem to confirm that galaxy / group accretion and cluster - cluster merger affect the cluster galaxies and that the galaxy properties can be sensitive indicators of the merger stage .",
    "the colour - density relation is observed in galaxy clusters well beyond @xmath32 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the fraction of star - forming galaxies steadily increases with cluster - centric radius . nevertheless even at 3 - 5@xmath33 r@xmath31",
    ", the fraction of star - forming galaxies is below that seen in the field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting that the environment plays a role inducing transformations well outside @xmath32 .    by means of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations @xcite investigated the trend of cold and hot gas contents and sf as function of clustercentric distance in clusters and groups of galaxies .",
    "they found a large - scale trend with cold and hot gas contents and sf increasing with the clustercentric distance , but approaching the values of the field galaxy sample only at @xmath34 ( corresponding to 10mpc for a massive cluster ) .",
    "moreover , the sf in low - mass cluster galaxies ( m=10@xmath35m@xmath36 ) still shows a significant discrepancy even at this large radius with respect to that of the field galaxies . according to the authors , three main causes",
    "can explain the observed trends : i ) ` pre - processing ' of galaxies within infalling groups ; ii ) ` overshooting ' for those galaxies that are not falling in for the first time ( also called ` backsplash ' galaxies ) ; iii ) ram - pressure stripping .",
    "of course , the three mechanisms act differently depending on the galaxy and host halo mass and the clustercentric distance , but in any case the radial trend of the hot gas can not be explained solely by overshooting and pre - processing . a direct interaction with the host group / cluster is also required and their simulations suggest that ram - pressure stripping can strip the hot gas from low- and high - mass galaxies out to several times @xmath32 , although it can not affect the cold gas except for the low - mass galaxies .",
    "the authors also claimed that tidal interaction does not play an important role in the gas removal , but it should be an important factor in the morphological transformation of these galaxies .",
    "s0s differ from normal spirals by their higher bulge luminosities rather than fainter disks @xcite , disfavouring simple rps or starvation mechanisms ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "instead , mechanisms such as merging or harassment are capable of channelling material to a central bulge , sufficient to produce the higher central mass densities seen in cluster spirals and ultimately the stellar phase densities found in s0s @xcite .",
    "this channeling of material will also likely fuel rapid growth of the central supermassive black hole and trigger a period of nuclear activity .",
    "deep observations are needed to reveal tidal streams or ` fans ' , characteristic of recent merging activity @xcite .    in - situ transformation via merging in clusters is strongly suppressed due to the high encounter velocities .",
    "low - velocity encounters and mergers should be much more frequent in galaxy groups , leading to the suggestion that the bulge growth required to form s0s occurs primarily via pre - processing in galaxy groups , which are subsequently accreted into clusters @xcite .",
    "moreover , the s0 fractions of @xmath37 groups match those seen in clusters at the same redshifts , and are much higher than found in the field @xcite .",
    "strong nuclear activity which is linked to bulge growth is also found to be effectively suppressed in cluster galaxies , with the distribution of x - ray agn in rich clusters revealing them to be an infalling population with high relative velocities @xcite .",
    "this confirms that the transformation of galaxies often occurs ( or begins at least ) well outside the cluster cores , in groups or as infalling galaxies enter the virialized region for the first time @xcite .",
    "hints about the distribution of galaxy luminosity , colours and morphology in the filaments have been given by @xcite , who found that brighter galaxies have a less filamentary distribution than the fainter ones .",
    "with respect to the morphology , the early - type galaxies are concentrated in the vicinity of the nodes , while spiral galaxies are sparsely distributed across the filaments .",
    "@xcite observed that the fraction of starburst galaxies in the filaments around the cluster a1763 is twice that in other cluster regions as detected by _",
    "spitzer _ and suggested that filaments are a sort of _ galaxy reservoir _ for clusters .    by studying a sample of supercluster filaments in the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ,",
    "@xcite observed a sudden enhancement in sf in faint dwarf galaxies outside the cluster virial radius .",
    "they interpreted their findings with a close interaction and/or harassment with other infalling galaxies along the same filaments .",
    "another possible explanation is the very first interaction that these galaxies experienced with the icm inducing tidal shocks and then a burst of sf .",
    "actually , the dominant processes that quench sf in galaxies depend crucially on the galaxy mass .",
    "dwarf galaxies , given their shallow potential wells , should be more susceptible to environmental processes such as tidal / ram - pressure stripping ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed their sf histories are completely defined by their local environment , since passive des are only found as satellites within massive halos ( i.e. cluster , group or massive galaxy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the formation of many cluster des is often rather recent , manifest by young stellar ages ( @xmath38gyr ) and the significant populations of starburst and post  starburst dwarf galaxies in the outskirts of local clusters @xcite .",
    "ram - pressure stripping ( rps ) , as originally proposed by @xcite requires , in principle , the presence of a dense icm .",
    "thus , its effect would be limited to cluster cores where the gas discs of massive spirals are rapidly truncated .",
    "nevertheless , with a 3d hydrodynamical simulation , @xcite showed that rps may extend to poorer environments for low - mass galaxies which , thanks to their lower escape velocities , are easier to strip .",
    "@xcite , by means of high resolution 2d hydrodynamical simulations , demonstrated that ram pressure effects can be observed over a wide range of icm conditions .",
    "in particular , in high density environments rps severely truncates the gas disc of l@xmath5 galaxies , while in low density environments , where moderate ram pressure is foreseen , their gas disc is clearly disturbed and bent @xcite .",
    "the gas discs of these galaxies can be truncated to 15 - 20kpc in the first 20200myr of rps .",
    "@xcite identified a bright ( l@xmath39l@xmath5 ) barred spiral galaxy 1mpc from the centre of the rich cluster a3558 in the shapley supercluster core , which is strongly affected by rps .",
    "integral - field spectroscopic observations revealed ongoing gas stripping in the form of one - sided extraplanar ionized gas along the full extent of the disk , simultaneously with a starburst triggered by gas compression along the leading edge of the galaxy .",
    "the galaxy is estimated to be being subjected to weak - moderate ram pressure , as defined by @xcite .",
    "this adds a piece of evidence to the fact that rps is acting more efficiently on the galaxy interstellar medium ( ism ) than previously foreseen and also outside of the cluster cores as also observed in the virgo cluster by @xcite .",
    "this new understanding of the rps supports the view that this mechanism is the principal transformation process to quench sf in spirals although probably helped by other processes affecting the structure of the galaxies .",
    "@xcite drew a similar conclusion analysing a sample of 182 disk galaxies in the cluster system abell901/902 .",
    "the fraction of galaxies showing asymmetric gas rotation curves , and thus probably affected by rps @xcite , turned out to be 75 per cent higher in the clusters than in the field , the majority of them being morphologically undisturbed .",
    "although these galaxies seemed preferentially located at low clustercentric radii , they also observed a population of dusty and red spirals in the cluster outskirts , which could be also affected by ism - icm interactions .",
    "the relevance of rps for quenching sf in cluster galaxies is further complicated by the fact that a non - homogeneous icm is expected for non virialized merging and post - merging clusters , thus the clustercentric distance is not the only parameter describing the icm density , i.e. the ram - pressure strength .",
    "our study is based on characterizing a dynamically active environment in a multifaceted way and disentangling its effects on galaxy evolution .",
    "it has the following main objectives .",
    "- : :    to investigate the role of cluster - scale mass assembly on the    evolution of galaxies mapping the effects of the environment in the    cluster outskirts and along the filaments with the aim to identify the    very first interactions between galaxies and their environment .",
    "- : :    to identify and measure signs of ongoing transformation in galaxies    belonging to a complex structure with the goal of improving our    comprehension of what drives their star - formation quenching and    structural modification .",
    "- : :    to obtain detailed maps of the dark matter and baryonic matter    distributions ( galaxies , icm ) , combining weak lensing , x - ray and    dynamical analyses .",
    "- : :    to quantify the variation in the stellar mass fractions going from    cluster cores to groups , by comparing the near - infrared light    distribution with the dark matter maps and dynamical masses .",
    "- : :    to build up a multi - band homogeneous data - set on this area of the sky    made of sub - kiloparsec resolution imaging and magnitude - limited    spectroscopy , thus providing the community with a solid background for    studies of the shapley supercluster .    to address the above objectives we will explore the global and internal properties of galaxy populations extending outside the cluster / group virial radius and aim for an accurate characterization of the environment .",
    "this will be defined through galaxy density , dark matter distribution , dynamical substructure , and icm properties .",
    "the different quantifications of the environment will allow us to disentangle the effects of local and large - scale density , cluster and group merging , dynamical state and mass of the host system on the properties of galaxies in different ranges of mass .",
    "recent studies investigated the effects of the local and large - scale environment on galaxy evolution , mainly considering groups of galaxies .",
    "some of these works defined the environment through the luminosity - density only ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or associate galaxy groups to a large - scale environment identified by a smoothed luminosity field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or are limited to massive galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , although there is a general agreement that the group environment is important for the evolution of the group members , a study of global and internal properties of galaxy population in groups and , in general , in different structures dynamically bound in a supercluster is still lacking .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that both local ( distance from the centre ) and global ( mass ) group environments play a role in quenching star formation , while @xcite show that global group - scale mechanisms linked to the presence of a hot gas halo are dominant in quenching sf in group galaxies rather than purely density related processes .    in the following we briefly outline how we will derive the quantities necessary for our study",
    "( see also sect .",
    "[ survey ] ) .    as the main classification scheme of galaxies we will adopt the concentration , asymmetry and clumpiness parameters @xcite , complemented by the m20 and gini coefficients @xcite .",
    "this parameter set ( hereafter ` cas+mg ' ) has proven to robustly link the internal light distribution of galaxies to their formation and evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "besides being effective in separating the different morphological types and tracing star formation , the cas+mg scheme is particularly sensitive to their recent interaction or merging activities , making it the ideal tool to obtain a census of galaxies whose structure appears disturbed by the environment , which is crucial for our project . for a selected sample of ` normal ' galaxies ( as determined through the cas+mg parameters )",
    "it will be possible to quantify the relevance of ( pseudo-)bulges and bars as a function of the environment by surface photometry fitting .    in fig .",

    "we plan to perform classical ( visual ) morphological classification , that will be used to calibrate the cas+mg parameters against the hubble sequence for our data .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and spatial resolution of vst images will instead allow us to obtain reliable cas+mg parameters up to m*+6 ( @xmath41mag ) , i.e. well into the dwarf galaxy regime ( see sect .",
    "[ optical ] ) .",
    "finally , aaomega and literature spectra of more luminous galaxies will provide spectral classification through line indices .",
    "galaxy global properties such as colours , stellar masses and star - formation rates will be derived .",
    "the contribution of both unobscured and obscured sfr need to be considered since dust - obscured cluster galaxies are common in merging clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "wavelength data already available in the shapley supercluster core ( see sect .  [ cd ] ) , by obtaining correlations between luminosity , dust extinction , and metallicity .",
    "the available mid - infrared data will provide a robust and independent indicator of obscured star formation ( sect .  [ cd ] ) , and also allow us to identify agn via their unusually red w1-w2 colours ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "<S> we present an overview of a multi - wavelength survey of the shapley supercluster ( ssc ; z@xmath00.05 ) covering a contiguous area of 260@xmath1mpc@xmath2 including the supercluster core . </S>",
    "<S> the project main aim is to quantify the influence of cluster - scale mass assembly on galaxy evolution in one of the most massive structures in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> the shapley supercluster survey ( shass ) includes nine abell clusters ( a3552 , a3554 , a3556 , a3558 , a3559 , a3560 , a3562 , as0724 , as0726 ) and two poor clusters ( sc1327- 312 , sc1329 - 313 ) showing evidence of cluster - cluster interactions . optical ( @xmath3 ) and near - infrared ( @xmath4 ) imaging acquired with vst and vista allow us to study the galaxy population down to m@xmath5 + 6 at the supercluster redshift . </S>",
    "<S> a dedicated spectroscopic survey with aaomega on the anglo - australian telescope provides a magnitude - limited sample of supercluster members with 80% completeness at @xmath0m@xmath5 + 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> we derive the galaxy density across the whole area , demonstrating that all structures within this area are embedded in a single network of clusters , groups and filaments . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar mass density in the core of the ssc is always higher than @xmath6 , which is @xmath7 the cosmic stellar mass density for galaxies in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> we find a new filamentary structure ( @xmath07mpc long in projection ) connecting the ssc core to the cluster a3559 , as well as previously unidentified density peaks . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a weak - lensing analysis of the central 1deg@xmath2 field of the survey obtaining for the central cluster a3558 a mass of @xmath8 , in agreement with x - ray based estimates .    </S>",
