    "in @xcite , we proved that twelve copies of some spherical _ concave _ quadrangle organize two spherical tilings such that the two tilings have the same plain graph  ( the _ pseudo - double wheel _ of twelve faces  @xcite ) , but one spherical tiling  ( see the right bottom of figure  [ fig : chart_p_f ] ) is isohedral  ( i.e. the symmetry group acts transitively on the tiles ) while the other not  ( see figure  [ chart : a ] ) .",
    "the latter spherical non - isohedral tiling by congruent _ concave _ quadrangles over a pseudo - double wheel is a counterexample of the inverse of grnbaum - shephard s result  @xcite `` for every spherical _ normal _ tiling by congruent tiles , if it is isohedral , then the graph is a platonic solid , an archimedean dual  @xcite , an @xmath0-gonal bipyramid  ( @xmath1 ) , or an @xmath0-gonal trapezohedron  ( i.e. , the pseudo - double wheel of @xmath2 faces ) . '' so we ask an `` inverse problem '' of their result :      according to @xcite , when the tile is a kite , a dart , or a rhombi , every spherical tiling over a pseudo - double wheel is isohedral .",
    "moreover , by checking the number of tiles and the _ vertex types _ in the complete table of spherical monohedral triangular tilings  @xcite , we can prove that      to state our partial answer of this inverse problem , recall that we can not divide the tile of a spherical monohedral quadrangular tiling into two congruent triangles , if and only if the tile is either _ type  2 _ or _ type  4 _ of figure  [ fig : type24_map ]  ( figure  [ fig : type24_map ] ) , since the tile of a spherical monohedral quadrangular tiling has necessarily equilateral adjacent edges  ( * ? ?",

    "even if we can enumerate all graphs of spherical monohedral type-2/type-4 quadrangular tiling by computers , to show that spherical tilings by congruent _ concave _ quadrangles exist requires difficult trigonometric arguments because there is a spherical concave quadrangle @xmath11 such that there are continuously many spherical non - congruent quadrangles @xmath12 with the same cyclic list of inner angles of @xmath11 , according to @xcite .      1",
