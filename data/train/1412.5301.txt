    "the electronic structures of transition metals ( tm ) and their alloys and compounds show that several d - bands cross the fermi energy @xmath2 .",
    "their fermi surfaces are complex and occupy about all parts of the brillouin zone ( bz ) . calculations of electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the density - of - states ( dos ) at @xmath2 , @xmath7 an atomic mass and @xmath8 a weighted phonon frequency , became quite popular in the 70-ties when the matrix element @xmath9 could be determined quite easily from the band structure by the rigid muffin - tin approximation ( rmta ) @xcite .",
    "then , from bcs @xcite or the mcmillan formula @xcite the superconducting @xmath10 are estimated , and the results for pure elements , tm alloys , tm nitrides and carbides , c15 and a15 compounds are quite reasonable @xcite .",
    "the calculated @xmath4 are not precise , but good superconductors are clearly separated from less good or bad ones , with the observation that a high @xmath4 needs a high @xmath6 . the quantitative agreement with observed @xmath4 is improved when the pair - breaking effect from spin - fluctations are taken into account through the coupling constant @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "but , on the other hand , superconductivity in the very lightly doped semiconductors srtio@xmath11 ( sto ) , wo@xmath11 , diamond ( c ) and si @xcite is not easy to understand .",
    "their dos are very small and @xmath4 goes to zero already at modest dopings @xcite , despite the fact that the dos normally should go up with doping .",
    "the problems with the high-@xmath4 cuprates are well - known @xcite .",
    "the band gap in undoped cuprates is absent in density functional theory ( dft ) band calculations .",
    "moreover , epc alone is probably too weak to explain @xmath4 , since @xmath6 s are small with few bands at @xmath2 and simple fs s .",
    "spin - phonon coupling ( spc ) enforces @xmath12 s @xcite , and spin - fluctuations could be determining for @xmath4 @xcite , as also could be the case for low @xmath4 s in zrzn@xmath13 @xcite and fe under high pressure @xcite .    here",
    "we make an effort to understand the difficult cases by doing some corrections of how epc is to be evaluated for materials with simple fs .",
    "the band structure results presented here are made using the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method @xcite and the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) @xcite .",
    "electronic correlation beyond that contained within density - functional theory ( dft ) is disregarded .",
    "it is sometimes argued that correlation is too strong for having traditional bands in undoped cuprates when the d - band is half filled .",
    "but dft bands and fs s for doped cuprates agree well with arpes ( angular - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ) and acar ( angular correlation of positron annihilation radiation ) @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath9 in the rmta leads to dipole transitions that couple states @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "the d - bands in tm compounds are hybridized with p and f , and this fact makes @xmath16 large . from its name",
    "it is understood that the potential is displaced `` rigidly '' to get the dipolar matrix element as a first order change of the band energy as function of the displacement . however , in ionic systems there are also changes in the local madelung potential when an atom is displaced , which leads to a monopolar matrix element @xcite .",
    "this makes the coupling largest for unhybridized bands , as for the cu - d band in cuprates , the d - band in doped srtio@xmath11 ( sto ) and wo@xmath11 , and the p - band in hole doped c and si .",
    "since @xmath17 ( at k - points on the fs ) is the first order change of the band energy @xmath18 , it can also be obtained from the change in band energy when a phonon modifies the potential .",
    "the advantage with this method is that both the monopole and dipole contribution are included .",
    "the result also takes screening into account when the calculations are selfconsistent .",
    "this method has been used in the nearly - free electron ( nfe ) model @xcite , as well as in fully self - consistent lmto calculations @xcite , to show that the largest @xmath17 appears for phonon q - vectors that span the fs .",
    "only few q - vectors generate gaps at @xmath2 , and together with the dominant contribution from nested fs it leads to involvement of rather few q - modes for simple fs @xcite .",
    "the fs s in electron doped sto and hole doped c and si , consist of simple small pockets at the @xmath19-points , so that all of the electron - lattice interactions are concentrated to a small fraction of the bz near the zone center .",
    "the logarithm of the bcs equation for @xmath4 ; @xmath20 , permits a separation of the dominant energy cost from excitations of phonons with vector @xmath21 from the electronic energy gain from different pieces of the fs at @xmath22 .",
    "an average of @xmath23 over the entire phonon spectrum includes frequencies up to the debye frequency for q - vectors at the limit of the bz , but only up to a much smaller cutoff for weakly doped semiconductors , since no gain in total energy comes from larger @xmath24 , see fig .",
    "[ figphon ] .",
    "the cost of phonon energy is therefore much reduced , and it compensates for the low @xmath6 . a simple estimation of these energies for a debye phonon dos , @xmath25 , and free electron dos ( both in 3-dimensions ) at low doping show also that this energy balance becomes less favorable at higher doping , so that @xmath4 goes down @xcite",
    ". thus , the absence of large - q phonon excitations can explain superconductivity from acoustic small - q , low - energy phonons in weakly doped semiconductors despite their low dos , and the drop in @xmath4 for increased doping @xcite . according to this",
    ", only long wavelength phonons appear at @xmath26 together with lattice disorder from zero - point motion ( zpm ) .",
    "the fs in cuprates involves large - q vectors between nested sections of the 2-dimensional circular fs .",
    "the fs becomes almost diamond shaped at optimal doping , when the fs reaches the x - point of the bz and the dos has a van - hove singularity peak .",
    "this permits reduced number ( ideally only two ) of phonon / spin mode excitations between electron states on two parallel fs sheets in order to create a gap over the whole fs .",
    "this not exactly as the small - q situation in doped semiconductors , but the 2-dimensional structure with few flat sections of the fs is likewise favorable to superconductivity despite a low @xmath6 @xcite . in this context it can be noted that @xmath4 in ba@xmath13cuo@xmath11 is found to be much larger than in la@xmath13cuo@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the electronic interplane interaction is reduced in the former material because of less apical oxygens , and it makes the fs even more flat at optimal doping than in la@xmath13cuo@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "additional ordering of dopants into static stripes has been suggested to lead to a segmentation of the fs and enhanced @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if such enhancement can come from fewer phonon / spin excitations or from increased dos because of stripe order @xcite .",
    "it can also be noted that weak signs of ferromagnetism are present at high doping @xcite .",
    "however , the doping is very high and beyond the concentration where superconductivity can be found .",
    "anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) order is installed on cu at zero doping .",
    "the amplitude of afm moments and local exchange splittings decreases for increasing doping , which introduces a doping dependence of the coupling constant for spin fluctuations ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "calculations of the strength of @xmath1 are uncertain because of the problem with lda to describe the static afm order and the band gap for undoped cuprates @xcite , but as expected , there is a clear decrease of @xmath1 as function of doping @xmath28 ( holes / cu ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , phonons and spin waves are mutually enforcing each other through spc @xcite .    .",
    "it is argued that the largest epc in doped semiconductors is found for the acoustic low energy mode .",
    "optic modes in underdoped cuprates are not efficient for long - range superconductivity , but acoustic modes grow in importance at higher doping .",
    ", width=302,height=264 ]      the anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) spin arrangement on cu sites along @xmath29 in undoped cuprates can be described by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the exchange splitting and @xmath32 .",
    "doping makes the gap to appear at lower energy and the band ( @xmath18 ) is crossing @xmath2 for @xmath33 .",
    "the afm order is modulated by @xmath34 and the spin potential becomes @xmath35 optimal doping corresponds to @xmath36 , with `` stripes '' covering 4 sites , and the exchange splitting decreases for larger @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the vector @xmath24 is small at very low doping , and the spin arrangement is almost like an optic wave , see fig [ figop ] .",
    "the spin distribution of an optic wave ( or atomic displacements for phonons ) is regularly zero over a large region ( at times @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ figop ] ) , which in principle makes @xmath12 time dependent . an acoustic wave , however , has always the same shape ( fig .",
    "[ figac ] ) .",
    "if @xmath24 is very small ( almost optic ) , with very wide stripes covering several tens of atoms , then the wave is intact as for a short acoustic wave .",
    "but rather wide regions between the stripes have very small spin / distortion amplitudes ( for the short wave in fig .",
    "[ figac ] one of 4 sites has zero spin / distortion ) .",
    "the suggestion is that long - range superconductivity is not possible if the regions with small spin / distortion amplitudes are wider than the coherence length .",
    "alternatively , superconductivity could still be possible , but at a lower @xmath4 than what is expected from the large amplitudes within the stripes .",
    "possible short - range superconducting fluctuations within the stripes are sufficient for a high @xmath4 , and can be the cause of the pseudogap at @xmath38 .",
    "some numbers to give substance to this idea : the bcs coherence length , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the fermi velocity ( taken from the calculated bands in la@xmath13cuo@xmath27 @xcite to be between 10 and 35 @xmath41 from underdoping , ud , near @xmath28=0.05 to optimal doping , od , near h=0.15 ) and @xmath42 the superconducting gap ( here @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is supposed to be due to superconducting fluctuations .",
    "typical @xmath38 are in the range 60 - 30 @xmath45 from ud to od @xcite ) from which @xmath46 can be estimated to be between 1@xmath47 and 7@xmath47 at low t , respectively .",
    "this gives very approximately ; @xmath48 ( units of @xmath47 ) .",
    "the wave lengths , @xmath49 , of spin waves and phonons are related to doping , @xmath28 holes / cu . from lmto supercell calculations @xmath50 in units of @xmath47 ( @xmath49 is the length of a unit cell along [ 100 ] in which one spin wave or two phonon waves can fit ) , and the amplitudes @xmath51 are calculated to be of the order 25 - 17 mry between ud and od @xcite . in the wave drawn in fig [ figac ] the zero spin / displacement region covers 1/8th of the cell . by assuming that @xmath46 must be larger than the width @xmath52 in which @xmath53 is smaller than @xmath54 of the maximal @xmath51 we get the condition @xmath55 , which gives @xmath52 smaller than 1.6 to 0.5 @xmath47 from ud to od .",

    "note that the wave is identical at all times except for the phase .",
    "a cuprate spin wave would have afm spin orientation on near neighbors , as in fig . [ figop ] , but all modulated by the long - range envelope function .",
    ", width=302,height=226 ]    the value of @xmath46 increases when @xmath57 gets closer to @xmath4 , but at higher temperature there are thermal disorder of the lattice @xcite .",
    "the latter is known to induce band broadening ( @xmath58 ) and temperature dependent variations of non - superconducting properties in many materials @xcite .",
    "there will be irregular variations of the local potential as a function of time , more so at high temperature and for a soft lattice .",
    "well - defined waves along the lattice are required in order to generate a neat gap at @xmath2 , when the coulomb - part and/or the spin - part of the potential is close to cosine - like shape , as in eq .",
    "thermal disorder generates random potential fluctuations on the atomic sites , and if the fluctuation amplitudes , @xmath59 , are comparable to @xmath51 then they will interfere with the cosine wave and finally make it unrecognizable .",
    "cuprates are unique because of the afm order on cu , and the spin - polarized part of @xmath59 turns out to be more sensitive to disorder than the coulomb part .",
    "disorder makes large shifts of the local madelung potential , but the exchange splitting ( @xmath60 ) on different cu sites develops quite differently , and the calculation show that @xmath59 at rt for a disordred supercell of la@xmath61cu@xmath62o@xmath63 is larger than @xmath51 calculated for a cosine spc wave in a hg based cuprate @xcite .",
    "calculations of @xmath51 for simple afm in undoped la@xmath61cu@xmath62o@xmath63 show that the average of moments and @xmath51 goes down with disorder . at rt",
    "the averages are approximately 2/3 of those for the ordered structure , and the amplitude of individual moments varies by a factor of three ( or more for weak spin waves ) , which shows that afm waves are much perturbed by disorder , see fig [ figafm ] . the average valence electron charge on cu increases from 10.39 to 10.47 at this level of disorder , as if disorder reduced the level of hole doping .",
    "band broadening is proportional to the rms - average of @xmath59 , and long - range superconductivity could be suppressed by thermal disorder if @xmath59 exceeds the superconducting energy gap .",
    "the band broadening from thermal disorder is difficult to calculate , since it needs large supercells . in other materials",
    "the averaged broadening @xmath64 is calculated to be of the order 50 mev at room temperature ( rt ) when the average of the atomic displacements is about 0.1  @xcite . here , for undoped lco @xmath58 is about 28 mev in the coulomb part , and about 60 mev when the calculations are made for an afm configuration .",
    "potential shifts on cu caused by disorder are typically larger than @xmath64 on about 1/4 of all cu .",
    "cu@xmath62o@xmath63 , where an applied field of @xmath65 mry sets up an afm spin alignment along the 100 direction in the supercell .",
    "the disorder corresponds to that of room temperature .",
    ", width=302,height=226 ]    the coupling strength @xmath51 for spin fluctuations increases when @xmath66 , because the afm state is more and more developed at low doping and finally the cuprates become insulators with stable afm moments at zero doping . but",
    "@xmath4 is known to have a maximum for @xmath67 0.15 . in a very approximate drawing of a phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phdiagfig ] we suggest that superconducting fluctuations can survive at low doping up to large temperature proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "no fluctuations appear above @xmath4 at high doping , because @xmath51 is not large .",
    "thermal disorders supress superconductivity at all dopings .",
    "if disorder puts a limit to the long - range superconductivity , one may search for ways to recuperate a higher @xmath4 by some kind of stabilization of superconducting fluctuations . at low @xmath57",
    "it seems that longer @xmath46 can be obtained via higher @xmath40 , as probably is achieved naturally in many cuprates by a static pseudogap .",
    "this would permit an extended pairing at ud , but superconductivity will be weaker because a higher @xmath40 implies a lower @xmath68 and weaker coupling .",
    "anharmonicity could also be favorable , since the thickness of a zone with low @xmath51 will be narrower for a step - like wave than for a cosine wave . at higher",
    "@xmath57 it is difficult to get rid of thermal disorder .",
    "higher coupling constants , especially for spin fluctuations , should be efficient to enforce clean spin waves , but the problem is that also @xmath59 will profit from high exchange enhancement .",
    "therefore , bad influence from disorder could spoil the effect of enforced spin waves .",
    "structural disorder will be smaller in a stiffer lattice at a given @xmath57 , and since the spin disorder is largely an effect of the structural disorder , it suggests that lattice hardening would help .",
    "this can be achieved by applying pressure , but the strength of the spin wave ( @xmath51 ) must not decrease when the volume is reduced .",
    "the idea that a higher @xmath68 provides a larger gain in electronic energy from a superconducting gap , and hence stronger coupling constants and higher @xmath4 , is still valid at large disorder .",
    "how to modify the cuprate band structures in order to get higher dos without destroying other properties might be difficult , perhaps ordering of impurities into stripes is a promising way @xcite .    , but @xmath4 is zero to the left of the line for @xmath46 due to a short coherence length . thermal disorder will gradually destroy well - defined waves at a certain level indicated by the red horizontal lines .",
    "long - range superconductivity would be possible below the lines , but only fluctuations on the left side of the @xmath46-line.,width=302,height=226 ]",
    "electron - phonon interaction and coupling from spin fluctuations are largest when the q - vector of the lattice / spin wave is equal to the k - vector on the fs , at least for the cases of simple fs s of cuprates and some doped semiconductors .",
    "this is evident for nfe bands , but it is also seen in the ab - initio calculated band structures of cuprates @xcite . for a simple fs it is therefore possible that superconductivity relies only on a few phonon / spin excitations , which makes superconductivity possible even if @xmath68 is small .",
    "in contrast , for a complicated fs practically the entire phonon / spin spectrum is needed to open gaps over all parts of the fs .",
    "further , it can be noted that a pure optic mode should have a frequency dependent coupling .",
    "a long wavelength modulation of an optic mode , as for underdoped cuprates , behaves as a normal acoustic mode , but wide regions with small coupling could prevent long - range superconductivity .",
    "shorter wave lengths of acoustic modes at higher doping do not have this property , but thermal disorder at high temperature will cause potential fluctuations which compete with and prevent long - range superconductivity . based on such mechanisms we speculate that the disorder prevents long - range superconductivity , but that superconducting fluctuations are left behind and they will cause a pseudogap below @xmath38 . there are no obvious solutions for an easy transformation of superconducting fluctuation into long - range superconductivity with higher @xmath4 , but the sensitivity of @xmath4 due to varied conditions is expected to be different at low and high doping .",
