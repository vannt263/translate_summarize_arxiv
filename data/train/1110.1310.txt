    "212 . let us consider any point on the trajectory of a spinning particle corresponding to its proper time @xmath212 ( we recall that all curves in figs .",
    "212 begin at @xmath213 ) .",
    "then the geodesic curve can be calculated which starts just at this point with the velocity that is equal to the velocity of the spinning particle at the same point . also , it is not difficult to estimate the deviation of the pointed out nongeodesic curve from this geodesic . in principle , it means that in our comparison of the corresponding geodesic and nongeodesic curves we are not restricted to the trajectories of a spinning particle which start in the small neighborhood of the value @xmath1 only ( naturally , here we are restricted to the domain of validity of the linear spin approximation )",
    ". this conclusion may be useful for the generalization of the results obtained in this sec .",
    "on other motions of a spinning particle .",
    "in this paper , using the linear spin approximation of the mpd equations , we have studied the significantly nongeodesic highly relativistic motions of a spinning particles starting near @xmath1 in kerr s field .",
    "some of these motions , namely circular , are described by the analytical relationships following directly from mpd equations in the boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "others , noncircular and nonequatorial , are calculated numerically . for realization of these motions",
    "the spinning particle must possess the obital velocity corresponding to the relativistic lorentz @xmath90-factor of order @xmath86 .",
    "all considered cases of the spinning particle motion are within the framework of validity of the test - particle approximation when @xmath214 .",
    "the situation with a macroscopic test particle moving relative to a massive body with @xmath215 is not realistic .",
    "however , the highly relativistic values of the lorentz @xmath90-factor are usual in astrophysics for the elementary particles . for example , if @xmath216 is equal to three of the sun s mass ( as for a black hole ) , then @xmath135 for an electron is of order @xmath217 and from eq . ( 28 ) we have the @xmath90-factor of order @xmath218 .",
    "similarly , for a neutrino with the mass @xmath219 we have @xmath220 .    we can expect the effects of the significant space separation of some highly relativistic particles with different orientation of spin .",
    "indeed , the effects considered in this paper exhibit the strong repulsive action of the spin - gravity interaction . for another correlation of signs of the spin and the particle s orbital velocity",
    "this interactions acts as an attractive force . in general ,",
    "the last case is beyond the validity of the linear spin approximation .",
    "the nonlinear spin effects will be investigated in another paper . also , we plan to show that according to the mpd equations significantly nongeodesic orbits of a highly relativistic spinning particle , with the @xmath90-factor of order @xmath86 , exist for the much wider space region of the initial values of the particle s coordinates in a kerr spacetime than the orbits considered above . however , the corresponding calculations are very complicated because this result follows from the rigorous mpd equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) only , and is not common for the approximate equations ( 2 ) , ( 7 ) .",
