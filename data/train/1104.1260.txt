    "classical electrodynamics is well known to be a linear theory leading to the superposition principle . at the quantum level",
    "the basic qed lagrangian remains quadratic in the electromagnetic fields , so that the theory still appears to be linear .",
    "however , quantum fluctuations in the qed vacuum induce nonlinear effects that lead to a breakdown of the superposition principle @xcite . in particular",
    ", these qed fluctuations make the vacuum appear as an electrically and magnetically polarizable medium .",
    "the size of these corrections in nonlinear qed ( nlqed ) is very tiny , so that experiments with ultra - high intensity lasers have been proposed to search for these effects , e.g. @xmath11 pair production from the vacuum @xcite-@xcite , vacuum birefringence @xcite-@xcite , light diffraction by a strong standing electromagnetic wave @xcite , and nonlinear compton scattering @xcite .",
    "a different proposal , involving quasistatic external electromagnetic fields interacting with given electric or magnetic sources , has been made recently @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite",
    "general expressions were obtained for the induced electric and magnetic fields in such circumstances , and applied to the case of an electrically charged sphere in the presence of an external , quasistatic magnetic field . as a result of qed nonlinearity there appears an induced magnetic dipole moment , as well as corrections to the coulomb field of the sphere . in spite of this being a dramatic effect , experimental detection appears very challenging .",
    "the complementary case of a purely magnetic dipole moment placed in an external , quasistatic electric field @xmath12 was considered in @xcite .",
    "the result is an induced electric dipole moment @xmath13 , plus corrections to the magnetic field produced by the magnetic dipole .",
    "it was then suggested that the neutron could be used as a probe in the presence of large electric fields of order @xmath14 v / m , such as present in certain crystals . a distinctive feature of this induced electric dipole moment , which should help in its detection , is its peculiar dependence on the angle between @xmath13 and @xmath12 , or equivalently the angle between @xmath13 and the neutron spin .",
    "+ in this paper we follow up on the experimental observability of such an induced electric dipole moment of the neutron . on the theoretical side",
    "we complete the analysis of @xcite by computing the interaction hamiltonian of the neutron immersed in a large external quasistatic electric field @xmath12 , and an external , quasistatic , magnetic field @xmath15 of ordinary strength . given the nonlinearity of the problem one needs to check that ( a ) the magnetic interaction energy is of the usual form , ( nonlinear magnetic corrections due to @xmath15 are negligible ) , and ( b ) that the induced electric dipole does interact with the electric field @xmath12 that generates it .",
    "the latter interaction energy is expected to have the standard functional form @xmath16 , albeit with an a - priori unknown coefficient which we determine .",
    "next , we study the quantum behaviour of @xmath13 by means of the heisenberg equation of motion .",
    "this is important for experiments based on potential changes in the larmor frequency of the neutron spin around an external magnetic field due to the presence of @xmath17 .",
    "we find no effect here , thus ruling out experiments of this type to detect an induced electric dipole moment of the neutron .",
    "finally , we discuss in some detail a different approach based on neutron - nucleus scattering and conclude that this experiment offers an excellent opportunity to observe such an effect . this is due to the peculiar angular dependence of @xmath13 .",
    "we find that for sufficiently large momentum transfers , a scattering asymmetry is induced with such particular characteristics that it would be easy to distinguish from other standard effects .",
    "the experimental discovery of such an asymmetry would be the first ever signal of a nonlinear effect in electrodynamics due to quantum fluctuations in the qed vacuum .",
    "an appropriate framework to discuss nonlinear effects induced by quantum fluctuations in the qed vacuum is that of the euler - heisenberg lagrangian @xcite .",
    "this is obtained from the weak field asymptotic expansion of the qed effective action at one loop order leading to@xmath18where the omitted terms are of higher order in the expansion parameter @xmath19 . in si units",

    "this statement is underlined by the fact that at leading order in @xmath198 the @xmath168-dependent term in @xmath126 , eq.([f - final ] ) , does not depend on @xmath173 . for @xmath221 , one thus obtain a prediction for the asymmetry which should be robust against variations in the choice of @xmath173 , i.e. @xmath222for a neutron energy of @xmath223 in a backscattering geometry one expects @xmath224 from a practical point of view the polarization of epithermal neutrons with more than @xmath225 requires a spin filter of polarized protons .",
    "this is technically demanding if one wishes to polarize a beam with a diameter of several cm .",
    "the measured energy - dependent neutron polarization cross section of a polarized - proton spin filter for the energy range of interest may be found in ref . @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "neutrons with energies up to @xmath226 are available from a hot moderator in a reactor neutron source with much higher intensity than epithermal neutrons .",
    "they can be polarized using magnetic monochromator crystals , or by a spin filter of polarized @xmath227he gas @xcite which has a polarization cross section proportional to @xmath228 .",
    "for the fluxes available at the institut laue - langevin ( ill ) in grenoble an asymmetry as in eq.([a - hot ] ) appears experimentally accessible within a few days of beam time .",
    "+ to conclude this section we stress that the neutron scattering asymmetry due to nonlinear qed has two characteristic properties which should make it rather easy to detect and distinguish from other effects .",
    "first , the asymmetry attains its maximum value for perpendicular orientations of the neutron polarization and vanishes for opposite orientations .",
    "this is in contrast to most ordinary asymmetries which become maximal for opposite orientations .",
    "second , @xmath229 exhibits a characteristic @xmath219 dependence with a broad maximum around the value of @xmath219 given in eq.([qr ] ) .",
    "these features are discussed in more detail in the sequel .",
    "in this section we study the contributions to the asymmetry @xmath230 , eq.([def - a ] ) , from the various ordinary scattering amplitudes defined in eq.([scattering amp ] ) .",
    "the neutron spin - dependent amplitudes can be written as @xmath231   \\label{f - spin - dep}\\]]where @xmath232 is spin independent , and @xmath233 is a vector not correlated with the neutron spin . in the case of the weak amplitude @xmath234 the vector @xmath111",
    "must be replaced by @xmath113 .",
    "for instance , for the nuclear amplitude in eq.([a - spin ] ) , @xmath233 is independent of @xmath111 and given by the nuclear spin @xmath235 .",
    "it can be shown in general that the terms proportional to @xmath236 in the differential cross section , eq.([sigma - diff ] ) , are all independent of the neutron polarization and therefore can not generate an asymmetry . in principle",
    "these terms influence the size of @xmath230 through the total scattering cross section @xmath237 , eq.([a - new ] ) .",
    "for scattering angles @xmath238 the pure spin - orbit cross section , quadratic in the amplitude @xmath239 , might become large enough to have an impact on @xmath237 .",
    "however , for sufficiently large @xmath203 , and in the absence of nuclear and electronic polarization , corrections to @xmath237 due to squared - amplitude terms can be safely neglected .",
    "the interference terms between the nuclear and the other scattering amplitudes in eq.([sigma - diff ] ) may however affect the asymmetry @xmath199 through their dependence on the neutron polarization .",
    "this requires careful consideration , and we start with the amplitude @xmath239 for spin - orbit scattering .",
    "it originates in the interaction of the neutron magnetic moment with the magnetic field present in the neutron rest frame due to its motion through the atomic electric fields .",
    "its expression is ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath240 \\left ( \\mathbf{s}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\right ) ,   \\label{f - so}\\]]where @xmath241 $ ] is the fourier transform of the electric charge density of the atom .",
    "this term involves the nuclear charge @xmath242 and the atomic form factor @xmath243 normalized to @xmath244 .",
    "this form factor is measured e.g. in x - ray scattering off atoms , and is a real function of the momentum .",
    "the unit vector @xmath245 points along @xmath246 , so that the amplitude can contribute only if the neutron polarization has a component out of the scattering plane .",
    "the asymmetry due to the spin - orbit interaction is given by @xmath247 \\left ( \\mathbf{p}_{\\vert } \\cdot \\mathbf{n}-\\mathbf{p}_{\\perp } \\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{a - so}\\]]the imaginary part of @xmath144 above is due to nuclear absorption and can be calculated using the optical theorem .",
    "lead nuclei absorb neutrons only weakly so that @xmath248 for neutron energies of interest here . for a scattering angle",
    "@xmath249 a neutron kinetic energy of @xmath250 would be required to observe the maximum asymmetry according to eq.([a - epi ] ) . in this case",
    "the atomic form factor @xmath251 , and a maximum asymmetry @xmath252 should be observed for @xmath253 perpendicular to the scattering plane , i.e. @xmath254 ( while @xmath255 by definition ) . as a result , for @xmath256 one",
    "has @xmath257 , while for @xmath258 together with the conservative value @xmath259 , the asymmetry becomes @xmath260 .",
    "these values are already smaller than the corresponding values of @xmath261 , but with suitable experimental settings they can be reduced even further .",
    "notice that the condition @xmath262 required for @xmath263 can be realized for different orientations of @xmath253 , while also fulfilling @xmath264 .",
    "hence , choosing a backscattering geometry , for which @xmath265 together with @xmath266 , and using realistic assumptions about the experimental definition of the directions of @xmath267 and @xmath129 , one can easily suppress @xmath252 by a factor @xmath268 .",
    "hence , the impact of @xmath252 can be kept well under the @xmath269 level .",
    "+ next , the amplitude @xmath270 of the neutron - nuclear interaction in eq.([a - spin ] ) , when squared , gives rise to interference between its spin - dependent and spin - independent parts .",
    "after ensemble averaging this becomes proportional to @xmath210 and to the nuclear polarization @xmath271 . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "@xmath272 for nuclei with magnetic moment @xmath273 in a magnetic field @xmath274 ( @xmath275 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "if the target is at room temperature , and given that no magnetic field is needed at the position of the sample , the @xmath210-dependent cross section is orders of magnitude too small to have an impact on the asymmetry .",
    "+ we consider next the amplitude @xmath276 , which is due to the interaction of the neutron magnetic moment with the magnetic field produced by unpaired atomic electrons of paramagnetic contaminants in the sample .",
    "the operator structure of this amplitude is given by @xmath277 ,   \\label{f - mag}\\]]where @xmath278 is the fourier transform of the total ( spin and orbital ) magnetization of the atom , and @xmath279 .",
    "the interference term with @xmath144 thus involves the neutron polarization and the sample - averaged magnetization .",
    "it would only influence the asymmetry if ( 1 ) the ratio @xmath280 is sufficiently high to result in a sizable magnetization , ( 2 ) paramagnetic centers are sufficiently abundant , ( 3 ) the two neutron polarization states in the asymmetry have different projections perpendicular to the scattering plane ( which is a consequence of the term in brackets in eq.([f - mag ] ) ) , and ( 4 ) measurements are performed for sufficiently small @xmath219 , where the magnetic form factor still has a sizable value . regarding the latter , even for the smaller value of @xmath219 envisaged in eq.([a - hot ] ) , the magnetic form factor leads to a strong suppression of @xmath276 .",
    "hence , with the conditions 1 , 2 and 3 under experimental control one can safely disregard magnetism as a source of an asymmetry .",
    "+ finally , the parity - violating amplitude @xmath234 due to the hadronic weak interaction may lead to a different type of asymmetry which has indeed been observed in neutron transmission experiments .",
    "effects depend on the neutron helicity , hence @xmath281 in eq.(f - spin - dep ) , with a complex coefficient to describe both parity violating spin rotation and transmission asymmetry .",
    "the amplitude is normally so small that it requires special efforts to detect it .",
    "for thermal neutrons , transmission asymmetries for longitudinally polarized neutrons forte/1980 have typical sizes of a few times @xmath282 . however , for neutron energies in the vicinity of p - wave resonances of complex nuclei a strong enhancement due to the weak nuclear interactions may appear .",
    "a prominent example is the transmission asymmetry of @xmath283 found at the p - wave resonance of @xmath284 in @xmath285la @xcite .",
    "however , no effect sufficiently strong to affect the asymmetry @xmath261 is known for lead in the relevant energy range . in addition , an experimental test can easily be performed .",
    "in fact , taking the neutron polarization @xmath129 parallel and anti - parallel to @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath286 and @xmath287 , it follows from eqs.([f - final ] ) and ( [ a - new ] ) that @xmath288 for these two polarization orientations .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath234 one has @xmath289 , which could be measured separately and corrected for if the need arises .",
    "the electric amplitudes @xmath290 and @xmath291 do not generate any known scattering asymmetry .",
    "however , owing to their characteristic @xmath219-dependences a comparison with the nlqed amplitude @xmath126 is needed .",
    "like @xmath126 , the amplitude @xmath290 due to the electric polarizability of the neutron , @xmath292 , is induced by the nuclear electric field , eq.([field nucleus ] ) . in si units",
    "@xmath292 is defined by @xmath293 , so that its dimension is @xmath294 = \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ ] .",
    "the calculation of @xmath290 follows from eq.([f ] ) with the interaction energy given by eq.([h - el - pol ] ) .",
    "this leads to the integral eq.([i-1 ] ) with the result given in eq.(i-1-sol ) .",
    "however , the lower limit of the radial integration is now different from that for @xmath126 .",
    "in fact , this lower limit can now be extended down to the nuclear radius @xmath175 , since for @xmath295 the neutron probes only the long - range electric forces . for @xmath296",
    "the electric interaction is small in comparison with the nuclear force , so that in early calculations @xcite-@xcite it has simply been included in the nuclear amplitude . in si units and for the electric field given in eq.([field nucleus ] ) , the dependence of @xmath290 on @xmath219 is given by @xmath297the term linear in @xmath219 is characteristic of the @xmath298 dependence of the hamiltonian , and it also enters the interference term in the cross section .",
    "this feature has been exploited in the past to measure @xmath292 .",
    "conflicting results from experiments performed during more than three decades show that a proper assessment of all systematic errors has been difficult ( see e.g. the table in ref .",
    "the most recent result @xcite , derived from energy - dependent neutron transmission through a @xmath299pb target , and reporting the smallest uncertainty is @xmath300calculations using quark bag models @xcite agree with this result .",
    "an early estimate of breit and rustgi @xcite using data on pion photoproduction already indicated that @xmath301 .",
    "these authors also analyzed other effects which might mimic a signal from the neutron electric polarizability . from an estimate of vacuum polarization effects close to the nucleus , and using the uehling potential @xcite",
    ", they concluded that this contribution to neutron scattering can be safely neglected .",
    "turning now to the question of shielding of the nuclear charge by the atomic electrons , one notices that this might quench the amplitude @xmath302 .",
    "since @xmath290 and @xmath126 both depend quadratically on the electric field @xmath47 , one can draw parallels with the analysis of @xmath290 .",
    "we recall that in our calculation of @xmath126 one needs to exclude a spherical region of radius @xmath173 around the nucleus inside which the weak - field expansion of the euler - heisenberg lagrangian breaks down .",
    "this procedure was followed ( for different reasons ) in the early calculations of @xmath290 @xcite-@xcite , @xcite where the nuclear region with radius @xmath175 was excluded . a more recent analysis which does not rely on a simple model for the nuclear charge distribution",
    "gives @xcite @xmath303where @xmath304 is the root mean square charge radius of the nucleus .",
    "this shows that slow neutrons are indeed insensitive to details at this length scale .",
    "notice that this result is nearly identical to the leading term in eq.([f - qcd ] ) after replacing @xmath175 by @xmath304 . in the derivation of eq.([f - pol - q - to-0 ] ) the following intermediate result was obtained in @xcite @xmath305 ,   \\label{f with f}\\ ] ] where @xmath306 and @xmath307 are the charge form factors of the nucleus and of the electron distribution in the atom , respectively . with @xmath308 , shielding of the nuclear charge can be neglected in @xmath290 . even in the limit @xmath309",
    "the neutron feels the full unscreened nuclear charge as far as the electric polarizability is concerned . for the nlqed",
    "induced electric dipole moment it follows that , with @xmath178 for lead , the corresponding correction term of order @xmath310 is much larger than the one of order @xmath311 .",
    "however , @xmath312 is still small enough so that one can neglect shielding of the electric field in the region around the nucleus .",
    "we now compare the two amplitudes @xmath290 and @xmath126 in the limit @xmath309 , i.e. their respective contributions to the neutron scattering length .",
    "setting @xmath313 and using eq.([alpha - exp ] ) one can estimate the leading order term in eq.([f - qcd ] ) as @xmath314from eq.([f - final ] ) the corresponding leading term in @xmath126 is @xmath315 where @xmath316 \\right ) ^{3}}\\,.\\ ] ] with the value of @xmath39 from eq.([a - constraint ] ) one obtains @xmath317 which is larger than @xmath292 , eq.([alpha - exp ] ) .",
    "however , the impact of this polarizability on the amplitude @xmath126 for @xmath318 is suppressed with respect to @xmath290 due to @xmath319 . in fact",
    ", for lead one obtains @xmath320 this result , though , is not even an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath321 , eq.([f - pol - q0 ] ) .",
    "it would thus contribute about @xmath322 to the neutron optical potential of solid lead , which is quite substantial given the high precision of some neutron optical methods .",
    "the contribution of the nlqed electric dipole moment to the total cross section is @xmath323 , where @xmath324 in eq.([sigma - diff ] ) has been used .",
    "numerically this becomes @xmath325     for unpolarized neutrons , eq.([f_ind - av ] ) , as a function of the dimensionless variable @xmath198.[figure2 ] ]    we discuss next the amplitude @xmath291 which describes the interaction of the electric charges of the atom with the internal charge distribution of the neutron as characterized by its mean squared charge radius .",
    "the amplitude for a bound nucleus is given by @xmath326 $ ] , with the atomic form factor @xmath243 given in eqs.([f - so ] ) and ( [ f with f ] ) , and the neutron - electron scattering length is @xmath327 as determined from measurements of the total cross sections of lead and bismuth at different neutron energies @xcite-@xcite . for lead and sufficiently large @xmath219 , @xmath328 , which leads to a contribution to the total scattering cross section sears/1986 @xmath329 .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that since @xmath330 this amplitude does not contribute to the neutron scattering length .",
    "the atomic form factor changes significantly at small @xmath219 where interference of neutron waves from different atoms can not be neglected .",

    "@xmath335 provides a scale at which significant changes in @xmath291 take place . for lead , @xmath336 , and @xmath337 in contrast , the change of @xmath338 is much smaller due to its milder @xmath219-dependence and its smaller magnitude ( see fig .  [ figure2 ] ) , @xmath339since the precision of the best measurements of @xmath340 is at the level of a few percent , potential background due to @xmath338 is negligible .",
    "a similar argument leads to the same conclusion for the determination of @xmath292 from @xmath290 .",
    "many , if not most proposals to detect nonlinear effects due to quantum fluctuations in the qed vacuum rely on experiments involving lasers of ultra - high intensities @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these intensities , though , are at least two orders of magnitude below current values .",
    "an alternative approach has been discussed in this paper , based on the theoretical prediction of an induced electric dipole moment of the neutron , @xmath13 , in an external quasistatic electric field @xcite .",
    "the peculiar features of this dipole moment , particularly its dependence on the angle between @xmath13 and the neutron spin , suggests the definition of an asymmetry which could be detected in the scattering of polarized neutrons from heavy nuclei .",
    "we have introduced this asymmetry and discussed all possible sources of background asymmetries .",
    "we have also compared the new nlqed amplitude with ordinary electric scattering amplitudes , particularly the one due to the polarization of the neutron in an electric field due to its quark substructure .",
