    "the helium - strong star @xmath1  ori  e  ( hd  37479 ; b2vpe ; @xmath4 ) has long been known to harbor a circumstellar magnetosphere in which plasma is trapped and forced into co - rotation by the star s strong ( @xmath5 ) dipolar magnetic field ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this magnetosphere is largely responsible for the star s distinctive eclipse - like dimmings , which occur when plasma clouds transit across the stellar disk twice every 119 rotation cycle @xcite .",
    "some fraction of the star s photometric variations likely also arise from its photospheric abundance inhomogeneities , as in other chemically peculiar stars ( e.g , * ? ? ?",

    "when combined with historical measurements by @xcite , these new data allow a precise measurement of the star s rotation period , and its evolution , over the past three decades .",
    "a description of the observations , both archival and new , is provided in the following section . in  [ sec : analysis ] , we discuss a procedure for accurately measuring the times @xmath6  of primary light minimum , and then use these measurements to construct a standard observed - minus - corrected ( @xmath7 ) diagram for the star , allowing us to assess the evolution of the star s rotation period .",

    "( [ eqn : period ] ) over the 19761998 interval spanned by the helium data .      before discussing the significance of the measured period increase , we briefly review factors that may have a systematic effect on this result . as demonstrated by @xcite ,",
    "the timing of light minima is sensitive to the optical depth of the magnetospheric plasma clouds . in principle , the progressive shift in @xmath6  toward later times ( seen in the residuals plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : o - c ] ) could be explained by the secular accumulation of plasma in the magnetosphere ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , based on the examples given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* his section  2.4 ) , the observed shift of @xmath68 between the 2004 and 2009 seasons would require a _ factor - six _ increase in the optical depth of the magnetosphere .",
    "the minima in fig .",
    "[ fig : minima ] clearly do not exhibit this kind of dramatic change . indeed , although there _ are _ some season - to - season variations in the minima depths ( on the order of @xmath69 ) , no monotonic trend is seen ; we believe the variations are probably due to changes in the distribution of scattered light from @xmath1  ori  ab . accordingly , we rule out the possibility that the @xmath6  shift is due to plasma accumulation .    similar reasoning can be addressed to concerns over the change in filters , from strmgren @xmath10 in 1977 to johnson @xmath0 in the later observations . in passbands where the magnetosphere is more opaque , the time of primary light minimum will tend to occur later .",
    "this color-@xmath6  correlation can be clearly seen in the @xcite observations ; in the strmgren @xmath10 band ( falling blueward of the balmer jump ) , the time of primary light minimum is @xmath70 later than in the @xmath71 band ( falling redward of the balmer jump ) .",
    "because the @xmath0 band straddles the balmer jump , the expected time lag between @xmath10 and @xmath0 should be around half of this , @xmath72 .",
    "an adjustment of this order to the 1977 @xmath6  point , to correct for the color-@xmath6  correlation , has a negligible effect on our results .",
    "a final possible issue comes from the use of parabolae to measure the primary minimum times . as discussed by @xcite , quadratic fitting",
    "is often eschewed in light - curve analysis on the grounds that it is unable to adequately model asymmetric light minima . however ,",
    "if the shape of the light curve does not vary from cycle to cycle , then this bias is irrelevant : it matters not that @xmath6  occurs slightly before or after the precise time of minimum , as long as the lead or lag remains invariant .    nevertheless , to explore any bias introduced by the use of quadratic fitting",
    ", we have repeated our analysis using cubic fitting to measure the @xmath6  values .",
    "three salient points stand out from this re - analysis : ( i ) the @xmath73  values of the cubic fits are not significantly smaller than those of the quadratic fits ( cf .  tab .",
    "[ tab : minima ] ) ; ( ii ) there s no evidence for a systematic lag or lead between the quadratic and cubic minima ; ( iii ) there _ is _ an obvious difference between the widths of the pdfs , which are a factor @xmath74 broader in the cubic cases than in the quadratic ones .",
    "thus , we conclude that quadratic minimum fitting does not introduce any appreciable bias , and moreover is the more robust approach .",
    "the helium - strong star hd  37776 was found by @xcite to exhibit a progressive lengthening in its @xmath75 rotation period , with a characteristic spin - down time @xmath76 . for @xmath1",
    "ori  e  the absence of photometric data in the 1980s and 1990s means that we can not empirically differentiate between steady spin - down and a sequence of abrupt braking episodes .",
    "however , the steady scenario is lent strong support by magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations of angular momentum loss in magnetically channelled line - driven winds @xcite , which indicate that the lengthening of rotation periods should be a smooth process . therefore , the use of a quadratic ephemeris ( cf .",
    "[ eqn : ephem ] ) appears justified , and we derive a characteristic spin - down time @xmath77 .",
    "this value coincides very well with the @xmath78 predicted specifically for @xmath1  ori  e  by @xcite , from their mhd - calibrated scaling law for spin - down times .",
    "( such a close agreement is partly fortuitous , given the uncertainties in stellar and wind parameters ) . assuming that @xmath79has remained constant over the lifetime of the star implies that it can be no older than @xmath80 ( otherwise , it would at some stage have been rotating faster than the critical rate @xmath81 ) .",
    "this upper limit on the age fits within the lower portion of the @xmath82 age range estimated for the @xmath1 orionis cluster ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in summary ,",
    "then , we conclude that the observations are consistent with @xmath1  ori  e  undergoing rotational braking due to its magnetized line - driven wind .",
    "this result is significant : although magnetic rotational braking is inferred from population studies of low - mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , direct measurement of spin - down in an individual ( non - degenerate ) object is noteworthy , and has been achieved so far for only handful of magnetic b and a stars ( see * ? ? ?",
