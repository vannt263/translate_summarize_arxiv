    "given a group @xmath10 , the fibred isomorphism conjecture of f.  t.  farrell and l.  e.  jones asserts that the algebraic @xmath0-theory of its integral group ring @xmath11 $ ] may be computed from the knowledge of the algebraic @xmath0-theory groups of its virtually cyclic subgroups ( see  @xcite or the appendix at the end of this paper for the statement of this conjecture ) .",
    "this conjecture has been verified for a number of classes of groups , such as discrete cocompact subgroups of virtually connected lie groups  @xcite , finitely - generated fuchsian groups  @xcite , bianchi groups  @xcite , pure braid groups of aspherical surfaces  @xcite , braid groups of aspherical surfaces  @xcite and for some classes of mapping class groups  @xcite . in  @xcite , lafont and",
    "ortiz presented explicit computations of the lower algebraic @xmath0-theory of hyperbolic @xmath12-simplex reflection groups , and then together with magurn , for that of certain reflection groups  @xcite .",

    "the braid groups of the @xmath3-sphere @xmath17 were first studied by zariski , and then later by fadell and van buskirk during the 1960 s  @xcite . if @xmath14 either is the @xmath3-sphere @xmath17 or the projective plane @xmath18 , its braid groups are excluded from consideration by  @xcite , the principal reason being that they possess torsion  @xcite .",
    "the second two authors of this paper proved that the farrell - jones isomorphism conjecture holds also for the braid groups of these two surfaces , which using the method prescribed by the conjecture , enabled them to carry out complete computations of the whitehead groups and lower algebraic @xmath0-groups for @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "one necessary ingredient in this process is the knowledge of the virtually cyclic subgroups of @xmath16 . for @xmath21",
    ", @xmath19 has only one non - trivial finite subgroup , that is generated by the ` full twist ' braid , which is central and of order @xmath3 , and from this , it is straightforward to see that @xmath19 has very few isomorphism classes of virtually cyclic subgroups .",
    "the classification of the isomorphism classes of the virtually cyclic subgroups of @xmath20 , which was established in  @xcite and used subsequently in  @xcite to compute the @xmath0-theory groups of @xmath22 $ ] , is rather more involved .",

    "the torsion of @xmath1 was determined in  @xcite , and its finite order elements were classified in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown by d.  l.  gonalves in collaboration with the first author that up to isomorphism , the finite subgroups of @xmath1 are cyclic , dicyclic or binary polyhedral ( see  @xcite or section  [ sec : classvc ] ) .",
    "as for the corresponding pure braid groups , one must then determine the infinite virtually cyclic subgroups of @xmath1 with the aid of the characterisation due to epstein and wall of infinite virtually cyclic groups  @xcite .",

    ", we encountered a number of difficulties , among them :    a.   the family of virtually cyclic subgroups of @xmath1 is relatively large , and depends on @xmath2 , contrasting sharply with the case of the pure braid groups analysed in  @xcite .",
    "b.   the lower algebraic @xmath0-theory of even the finite subgroups of @xmath1 is poorly understood , and the investigation of the @xmath0-groups of dicyclic and binary polyhedral groups presents additional technical obstacles compared to that of the dihedral and polyhedral groups that appear in  @xcite for example .",
    "c.   [ it : univspace ] in order to apply the method of calculation suggested by the fibred isomorphism conjecture , one needs not only to compute the various nil groups , but also to discover a suitable universal space for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups of @xmath1 . in spite of the rich topological and geometric structures of the braid groups and their associated configuration spaces , this space has",
    "thus far proved to be elusive for @xmath24 .",
    "sections  [ sec : whitehead][sec : kminusone ] are devoted to the second point , that of the computation of the lower @xmath0-theory groups corresponding to the finite subgroups of @xmath1 . in sections  [ sec :",
    "whitehead ] and  [ sec : kminusone ] , we calculate the whitehead and the @xmath5-groups respectively of the integral group rings of many of the finite subgroups of @xmath1 . to our knowledge , these sections contain a number of original results , as well as some new phenomena , such as the existence of torsion for some @xmath5-groups , that did not appear in previous work  @xcite .",
    "this necessitates alternative techniques , notably the application of results of yamada to determine local schur indices  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the methods that we use to calculate these @xmath0-groups for dicyclic groups of certain orders may be extended to dicyclic groups of other orders . in section  [ sec : kzero ] , we recall briefly the work of swan pertaining to the calculation of the @xmath25-groups of the group rings of the binary polyhedral groups , and of the dicyclic groups of order @xmath26 for @xmath27  @xcite . for the dicyclic groups , the situation is complicated , and little seems to be known about the @xmath25-groups corresponding to dicyclic groups of higher order .    in section  [ sec : calcingred ] , we describe the ingredients for the corresponding computations in the case of _ infinite _ virtually cyclic subgroups . in section  [ sec : kthb4st ] , we use the results of the previous sections to develop a specific example , namely @xmath28 .",
    "this group has several striking properties , one being that it contains a finite normal subgroup isomorphic to the quaternion group of order @xmath8 , this being a consequence of  ( * ? ? ?",

    "these properties aid greatly , not just in the computation of the @xmath0-groups of the virtually cyclic subgroups of @xmath7 and of the corresponding nil groups , but also to exhibit an appropriate universal space referred to in  ( [ it : univspace ] ) above .",
    "we study the case of @xmath28 in detail and show how the algebraic and geometric features of this group interact , which allows us to construct its whitehead group and lower @xmath0-groups .",

    "in contrast , we shall see that @xmath32)\\cong{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb z}}\\oplus { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb",
    "z}}_2 $ ] .",
    "the existence of torsion here is once more a new development compared with the families of groups considered in  @xcite .",
    "we sum up these results as follows :    [ th : b4 ] the group @xmath28 has the following whitehead and lower algebraic @xmath0-groups : @xmath33)\\cong{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb z}}_2\\oplus   \\operatorname{nil}_0,\\quad\\text{and}\\\\ k_{-1}({\\ensuremath{\\mathbb z}}[b_4({\\ensuremath{\\mathbb s}^{2}})])\\cong{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb z}}_2\\oplus{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb z}},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where for @xmath34 , @xmath35,\\ ] ] @xmath36 denotes a direct sum of two copies of a countably - infinite number of copies of @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is an infinitely - generated abelian group of exponent @xmath3 or @xmath39 .    for @xmath24",
    ", we can not expect the group @xmath1 to enjoy properties similar to those of @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , we have not been able as yet to determine an appropriate model for the universal space for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups of @xmath1 .",
    "there are some candidates suggested by the theory of brunnian braids , but the corresponding subgroups are of large index , and do not seem to be terribly useful from a practical viewpoint . on the positive side , for small odd values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the family of virtually cyclic subgroups is relatively small , and our techniques enable us to determine the corresponding @xmath0-groups . in  @xcite , we shall give some partial computations for other values of @xmath2 , and outline the missing ingredients required to calculate the whitehead and lower algebraic @xmath0-groups of their integral group rings .",
    "if we are able to find an appropriate universal space , we hope to be able to determine the @xmath0-groups of @xmath1 for other values of @xmath2 .      we would like to thank the following colleagues for helpful and fruitful discussions : bruno angls , for help with the galois theory of section  [ sec : rankkminusone ] ; eric jespers , gerardo raggi and ngel del ro ( and the ` gap ` package  ` wedderga `  @xcite ) , for aiding us with the wedderburn decomposition of dicyclic and binary polyhedral groups ; and jean - franois lafont , ivonne ortiz and stratos prassidis , for conversations on @xmath0-theoretical aspects of our work during the early stages of the writing of this paper .",
