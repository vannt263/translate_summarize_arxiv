    "the idea of negative index materials ( nims ) , i.e. materials with both negative electrical permittivity , @xmath6 , and magnetic permeability , @xmath7 , was first introduced by veselago @xcite . however , it was only recently that such materials were investigated experimentally , @xcite . although it has been well known how to obtain @xmath8 material easily ( e.g. using lattice of metallic wires ) , the realization of @xmath9 ( especially at high frequencies ) response had been a challenge , due to the absence of naturally occurring magnetic materials with negative @xmath7 . in 1999 ,",
    "pendry et al .",
    "@xcite suggested a design made a two concentric metallic rings with gaps , called split ring resonators ( srrs ) , which exhibit a @xmath9 around the magnetic resonance frequency @xmath10 .",
    "immediately after smith et al .",
    "@xcite fabricated the first negative index material at ghz frequencies .",
    "recently different groups observed @xcite indirectly negative @xmath7 at thz frequencies . in most of the thz experiments ,",
    "only one layer of srrs were fabricated on a substrate and the transmission , @xmath11 , was measured only for propagation perpendicular to the plane of the srrs , exploiting the coupling of the electric field to the magnetic resonance of the srr via asymmetry @xcite .",
    "it was realized that one only need the single srr to see the magnetic resonance effects .",
    "this way is not possible to drive the magnetic permeability negative .",
    "one reason is that is very difficult to measure with the existing topology of srrs and continuous wires both the transmission , @xmath11 , and reflection , @xmath12 , along the direction parallel to the plane of the srrs .",
    "so there is a need for alternative , improved and simplified designs that can be easily fabricated and experimentally characterized .",
    "this new design was recently achieved in the ghz region @xcite and the thz region @xcite by the use of finite length of wires and the fishnet topology .",
    "very recent work has moved the negative refractive index into optical wavelength @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    "we systematically studied the electric and the magnetic resonance response of u - shaped srrs for different propagating directions .",
    "the effective electric permittivity , @xmath6 , as well as the magnetic permiability , @xmath7 will be extracted by the retrieval procedure @xcite .",
    "in addition , the current distribution along the sides of the u - shaped srr will be numerically calculated .",
    "we show that the magnetic resonance are the modes with odd - number of half - wavelength of the current density wave , while the electric resonance are modes with integer number of whole - wavelength the current density wave .",
    "in addition we studied the dependence of the electric and magnetic resonance as a function of the length of the side arms of the u - shaped srr .",
    "it is found that the magnetic moment of the u - shaped srr vanishes as the length of side arms of srr reduces to zero .",
    "so there is no magnetic moment or magnetic resonance for a metallic rod .",
    "one needs the side arms of the u - shaped srr in order to have a magnetic moment .",
    "a common constituent to provide magnetic response in metamaterials is the split - ring resonator ( srr ) .",
    "the srr in its simplest form consists of a highly conductive metallic ring which is broken in one ( or several ) location(s ) by a non - conductive gap of air or other dielectric materials .",
    "if this ring is placed in a temporally varying magnetic field an electric circular current is induced in the metallic ring which in turn leads to charge accumulating across the gaps . the electric field which builds due to the charge at the gap counteracts the circular current leading to energy stored ( predominantly ) in vicinity of the gaps and magnetic field energy concentrated in the region enclosed by the ring .",
    "the srr is thus a resonator which couples to a perpendicular magnetic field and can be characterized by the effective capacitance of the gaps and effective inductance of the loop define by the ring .",
    "it can be understood in terms of a resonant @xmath13 circuit with a resonance frequency @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the inductance and @xmath16 is the capacitance of the srr .",
    "the resonant response of the circular current in the srr to an external magnetic field leads to a resonant magnetic moment which may reach large negative values for array of srrs such that the size of the srr is much smaller than the wavelength of an incident electromagnetic wave around the resonance frequency behaves as a homogeneous effective medium with at negative ( resonant ) permittivity @xmath17 .",
    "in this letter we report numerical results of electric and magnetic responses of a periodic lattice of srrs for different orientations of the srrs with respect to the external electric field , @xmath18 , and the direction of propagation , @xmath19 .    , magnetic field , @xmath20 , and wave vector , @xmath19 .",

    "the schematic of the periodic u - shaped srrs arrays and the geometry of a single unit cell used in our numerical simulation were shown in fig . [ fig1_structure](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the srrs exhibit different responses to the incident electromagnetic ( em ) wave with respect to different configurations of incident electric field , @xmath18 , magnetic field , @xmath20 , and wave vector , @xmath21 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1_structure](c ) .",
    "first , it is well know that the incident em wave excites a magnetic resonance at @xmath10 @xcite if the external magnetic field , @xmath20 , is perpendicular to the srr plane and the wave vector , @xmath19 , is parallel to the srr plane ( fig . [ fig1_structure](c.i ) ) .",
    "second , farther study reveals that the incident em wave with @xmath19 perpendicular to the srr plane and @xmath18 parallel to the bottom part of srr ( fig . [ fig1_structure](c.ii ) ) also excites a magnetic resonance at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this magnetic resonance results from a circular current induced by the external electric field , @xmath18 , because of the asymmetry of the srr in the direction of @xmath18 , and therefore was called the electric excitation coupling to the magnetic resonance ( eemr ) .",
    "the eemr is very valuable for the experimental demonstration of the magnetic resonance at optic frequencies , because it is very difficult to measure the transmission and reflection with the incident em wave parallel to the srr plane at high frequencies @xcite .",
    "third , the srrs also exhibit a short - wire - like electric resonance @xcite at @xmath22 with the incident electric field , @xmath18 , parallel to the side part of srrs ( fig .",

    "the eemr gives a similar resonance at roughly the same frequency , shown as a resonance shape in @xmath6 ( blue dashed ) , which indicate the response is due to the electric coupling of the incident em wave to srr . at a higher frequency , @xmath34 thz ,",
    "the short - wire - like electric resonance of the srr occurs , given by the resonance behavior of @xmath6 ( green dotted ) . due to the periodicity effect ,",
    "whenever a magnetic resonance occurs in @xmath35 , an electric anti - resonance will be seen in @xmath36 simultaneously and vice versa @xcite .",
    "the periodicity effect becomes more noticeable as the wavelength of em wave is comparable with the lattice constant of the srr lattice . for the magnetic resonance ( red solid ) ,",
    "the lattice constant , @xmath37 m , in the propagating direction along the wave vector , @xmath19 , is comparable to the resonance wavelength , @xmath38 m , hence , a strong distortion in the negative part of resonance in @xmath35 and a significant anti - resonance in @xmath36 were observed . on the other hand , for the eemr , the lattice constant , @xmath39 m ,",
    "is much smaller than @xmath40 , so the periodicity effect is much weaker and therefore a sharp resonance in @xmath36 ( blue dashed ) with a weak anti - resonance in @xmath35 occurs .",

    "this rod supports plasmonic modes @xcite ( plasmonic means in this situation that the inductance is coming from the electron mass and the capacitance from the external electric field over the surface of the rod ) which occur at discrete frequencies whenever we have current nodes at the ends of the rod .",
    "this picture is of limited value for the following reasons : ( i ) the em response of the modes , especially the classification of electric vs. magnetic response , depends on the geometry and is entirely different for a u - shaped srr than for a straight rod although the qualitative current distribution over the arc length is equivalent ; ( ii ) the plasmonic dispersion depends on the geometric inductance , i.e. the energy stored in the external field outside the metal , which is much larger for the srr than for the rod and spatially non - uniform along the srr ring ; and ( iii ) the modes of coupling are different .",
