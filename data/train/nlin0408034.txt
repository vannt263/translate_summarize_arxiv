    ", we suggest a scheme of @xmath0-deformation of nonlinear maps .",
    "we then elucidate the general features of a @xmath0-deformed logistic map related to the tsallis @xmath0-exponential function , as a concrete illustration of the scheme of @xmath0-deformation of nonlinear maps .",
    "theory of quantum groups turned the attention of physicists to the rich mathematics of @xmath0-series , @xmath0-special functions , etc .",
    ", with a history going back to the nineteenth century  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-deformation of any function involves essentially a modification of it such that in the limit @xmath1 the original function is recovered . thus there",
    "exist several @xmath0-deformations of the same function introduced in different mathematical and physical contexts . here , we are concerned mainly with the @xmath0-deformation of real numbers and the exponential function .",
    "originally , in 1846 heine deformed a number to a basic number as @xmath2_q = \\frac{1-q^n}{1-q } , \\label{eq : heinen}\\ ] ] such that @xmath3_q \\longrightarrow n$ ] when @xmath1 . in 1904 jackson defined a @xmath0-exponential function given by @xmath4_q ! } , \\label{eq : qexp}\\ ] ] with @xmath2_q !",

    "the mathematics of quantum groups necessitated a new deformation of number as @xmath2_q = \\frac{q^n - q^{-n}}{q - q^{-1 } } , \\label{eq : qgn}\\ ] ] which also has the required property that in the limit @xmath1 , @xmath3_q \\longrightarrow n$ ] .",
    "the associated @xmath0-exponential function is given by the same equation  ( [ eq : qexp ] ) but with @xmath3_q$ ] defined according to  ( [ eq : qgn ] ) .",
    "in the nonextensive statistical mechanics of tsallis  @xcite , a new @xmath0-exponential function has been introduced as given by @xmath9 which satisfies the nonlinear equation @xmath10 and has the required limiting behaviour : @xmath11 when @xmath1 .",
    "this @xmath12 plays a central role in the nonextensive statistical mechanics by replacing @xmath13 in certain domains of application ; it should be noted that it is natural to define a generalized exponential function as in  ( [ eq : tqexp ] ) if we consider the relation @xmath14 and regard @xmath15 as a continuous parameter .",
    "the formalism of nonextensive statistical mechanics has found applications in a wide range of physical problems  @xcite , including the study of nonlinear maps at the edge of chaos .",
    "here we derive another deformation of numbers based on the tsallis @xmath0-exponential function defined by  ( [ eq : tqexp ] ) , and use it to study a @xmath0-deformed logistic map as an example of the general scheme of @xmath0-deformation of nonlinear maps .",
    "the series expansion of @xmath12 has been presented in  @xcite as @xmath16 with @xmath17 let us take @xmath18 and write @xmath19 from  ( [ eq : bseries ] ) the series expansion of @xmath20 follows as @xmath21 with @xmath22 comparison of  ( [ eq : qexp ] ) and  ( [ eq : tauseries ] ) suggests that we have here another deformation of numbers : @xmath2_\\epsilon = \\frac{n}{1+(1-n)\\epsilon } , \\label{eq : defn}\\ ] ] such that @xmath23_\\epsilon = n.\\ ] ] then , we have @xmath24_\\epsilon ! } , \\ ] ] exactly analogous to the expression for @xmath25 in  ( [ eq : qexp ] ) .",
    "it is usual to extend the deformation rule for integers , such as in  ( [ eq : heinen ] ) or  ( [ eq : qgn ] ) , to any @xmath26 by substituting @xmath26 for @xmath27 . for example , the commutation relations of the @xmath0-deformed @xmath28 algebra are given by @xmath29_q,\\ ] ] where @xmath30_q$ ] is obtained from the definition of @xmath3_q$ ] in  ( [ eq : qgn ] ) by replacing @xmath27 by @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath30_q = ( q^{2j_0}-q^{-2j_0})/(q - q^{-1})$ ] .",
    "thus , we take that for any real number @xmath32 @xmath33_\\epsilon = \\frac{x}{1+\\epsilon(1-x)}.    \\label{eq : xq}\\ ] ] note that @xmath34_\\epsilon \\longrightarrow x$ ] when @xmath35 .",

    "we present the interesting properties of the @xmath0-logistic map in detail .",
    "figure  1 displays the @xmath0-logistic map function in  ( [ eq : qlog ] ) , @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the usual logistic map corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "it is clear that as @xmath46 moves away from @xmath47 the map gets more skewed .",
    "the map is skewed to the right for positive @xmath46 and to the left for negative @xmath46 .",
    "the lower and upper bounds for @xmath46 are , respectively , @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 vanishes . taking the domain of the @xmath0-logistic map the same as for the logistic map , namely the interval @xmath51 $ ]",
    ", it is found that the range of the @xmath0-logistic map is the same as for the logistic map .",
    "this is so because over the interval @xmath51 $ ] the map function @xmath50 has no singularity for @xmath52 , and @xmath53\\leq 1 $ ] for @xmath54 and @xmath34\\leq x$ ] for @xmath55 .",
    "there is one important qualitative difference between the usual logistic map and its deformed version . _",
    "the deformed map is concave in parts of @xmath32-space , whereas the usual logistic map is always convex_. note that the form of the @xmath0-logistic map is similar to certain maps used to model population dynamics , such as the bellows map : @xmath56 , and the moran - ricker exponential map : @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the nonlinearity parameter leading from periodic behavior to chaos  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the fixed points of the map in  ( [ eq : qlog ] ) are given by @xmath59 this has one solution at @xmath60 . for @xmath61",
    "the above equation becomes @xmath62 substituting @xmath63 in this equation gives @xmath64 or @xmath65 so @xmath66 thus , the fixed points @xmath67 of the @xmath0-logistic map are : @xmath68 figure  2 displays the numerically obtained fixed points of the map for @xmath69 for different values of @xmath46 .",
    "these coincide exactly with the analytical expression for @xmath70 above .",
    "it should be noted that for a given value of @xmath71 only for some range of values of @xmath46 both @xmath70 and @xmath72 lie within the range of @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig2 ]    figure  3 gives the bifurcation diagram of the map for @xmath73 with resepct to different values of @xmath46 .",
    "it is clear that the fixed point @xmath70 loses stability for negative @xmath46",
    ". this can be straight - forwardly understood from the absolute magnitude of @xmath74 , which crosses the value @xmath75 at @xmath45 when @xmath73 .",
    "[ fig3 ]    figure  4 gives the bifurcation diagram of the map for @xmath76 with respect to different values of @xmath46 . in this case the usual logistic map ( @xmath45 ) yields a @xmath77-cycle .",
    "as @xmath46 increases there is a reverse bifurcation and the @xmath78-cycle gains stability , followed by the fixed point .",
    "however , note that the fixed point at @xmath60 also gains stability when @xmath46 is sufficiently high , and we have a _ co - existence _ of attractors , namely , the fixed point at @xmath47 co - exists , first with the @xmath78-cycle and then with the fixed point @xmath70 .",
    "[ fig4 ]    similar features , namely reverse bifurcations in @xmath46-space , and the co - existence of the fixed point @xmath60 with other dynamical behaviour at high @xmath46 , are observed for larger values of @xmath71 as well ( see figs .",
    "5 - 9 ) .",
    "[ fig5 ]    [ fig6 ]    [ fig7 ]    [ fig8 ]    [ fig9 ]",
    "it is clearly evident from the above that the @xmath0-logistic map offers a rare example of multiple attractors in a one - dimensional smooth unimodal system  @xcite .",
    "the fixed point at @xmath60 co - exists with other kinds of dynamical behaviour when @xmath46 is sufficiently high .",
    "the basin of attraction for @xmath60 , as reflected in the fraction of initial conditions which are attracted to @xmath47 , monotonically increases with @xmath46 .",
    "figures  10 - 12 show the basins of attraction for the fixed point @xmath60 for three different values of @xmath71 .",
    "it is clear that this fixed point is a global attractor at sufficiently high @xmath46 . in figure  12 for @xmath44",
    "clearly there is a sharp transition to a global attractor ( where all initial conditions lead to @xmath60 ) at around @xmath79 .",
    "so , the fully chaotic logistic map under deformation with positive @xmath46 can yield stable fixed points .",
    "[ fig10 ]    [ fig11 ]    [ fig12 ]    the co - existence of attractors is also evident from the bifurcation diagrams for the map with respect to @xmath71 for different values of @xmath46 displayed in figs .",
    "13 - 15 .",
    "[ fig13 ]    [ fig14 ]    [ fig15 ]    figures  16 - 18 display the lyapunov exponents , obtained from trajectories arising from different initial conditions .",
    "16 displays the exponents with respect to @xmath46 for @xmath80 , and it shows two branches of lyapunov exponents arising from different initial conditions , after @xmath81 .",
    "both these co - existing exponents are below @xmath47 , indicating the co - existence of two regular dynamical behaviours .",
    "this is bourne out in fig .",
    "5  from where it is clearly evident that after @xmath81 the fixed point @xmath82 co - exists with a @xmath78-cycle .    in fig .",
    "17 one observes , for certain @xmath46 , both positive and negative lyapunov exponents are obtained for different initial conditions .",
    "this signals a co - existence of chaos and regular dynamics , as is clearly bourne out by the bifurcation diagram in fig .",
    "6 .    from the lyapunov exponents shown in fig .  18 and the corresponding bifurcation sequence in fig",
    ".  9 , it is clear that for @xmath44 , we have a global chaotic attractor extending over the entire interval for the usual logistic map ( @xmath45 ) , but obtain a global attractor at @xmath60 for @xmath83 .",
    "so @xmath0-deformation of a chaotic map can lead to stable fixed points .",
    "[ fig16 ]    [ fig17 ]    [ fig18 ]    the co - existence of attractors for the @xmath0-logistic map can be understood as follows .",
    "consider , for example , the case of @xmath84and @xmath85 where a @xmath78-cycle co - exists with the fixed point @xmath60 .",
    "figure  19 shows the form of the dynamical evolution function @xmath50 with respect to @xmath32 for these values of @xmath71 and @xmath46 .",
    "the figure also displays the @xmath86 line and the @xmath87 line .",
    "the intersection of the former with the @xmath50 curve yields the fixed points @xmath60 , @xmath72 and @xmath70 .",
    "the intersection of the latter with the @xmath50 curve yields the two pre - images for the fixed point @xmath72 .",
    "one pre - image is simply @xmath72 ( i.e. , it is also on the @xmath88 line ) as it is a fixed point solution .",
    "the other pre - image is given by : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this marks the beginning of the interval @xmath92 $ ] which maps on to the interval @xmath93 $ ] in the consequent iteration .",
    "these two intervals are dynamically connected and all points in it are attracted to the fixed point @xmath60 .",
    "notice however that the interval @xmath94 $ ] is never mapped to the other two .",
    "in fact it always maps on to itself .",
    "basically the @xmath50 in the range @xmath94 $ ] will lie in the interval @xmath95 $ ] , where @xmath96 is the maximum of the map @xmath50 .",
    "whenever @xmath97 , the middle segment will map onto itself .",
    "when this happens the dynamics in this segment will be distinct from that in the other two , and we will have a co - existence of dynamical attractors .",
    "figure  19 also shows the numerically obtained basin of attraction for the fixed point @xmath60 as a black bar on the @xmath32-axis , and clearly it falls exactly in the intervals outlined above .",
    "to summarize , we have introduced a scheme of @xmath0-deformation of nonlinear maps , enthused over studies on several @xmath0-deformed physical systems related to quantum group structures and inspired by the mathematical basis of tsallis statistical mechanics .",
    "we characterized the scheme in detail with reference to the logistic map .",
    "the resulting family of @xmath0-logistic maps has been found to have an interestingly wide spectrum of behaviours , compared to the usual logistic map . in particular one observed co - existence of attractors  a phenomenon rare in one dimensional maps .",
    "one can also study the @xmath0-deformations of maps following other deformation schemes , like based on  ( [ eq : heinen ] ) or  ( [ eq : qgn ] ) .",
    "we feel that the study of such families of deformed maps should be profitable for analytical modeling of several phenomena , as one parameter , namely the deformation parameter , can be used to fit a large range of functional forms , as evident from fig .  1 .",
    "for instance , it is seen that the experimentally constructed one dimensional map for the belousov - zhabotinskii reaction in a stirred chemical reactor  @xcite has a striking similarity to the @xmath0-logistic map in fig .  1 for negative epsilon value .",
    "clearly there are many interesting areas of research for further exploration .",
    "one can study the @xmath0-deformations of the various other nonlinear maps ( one or higher dimensional ) and coupled map systems .",
    "further , in higher dimensional cases and coupled map systems one can experiment with different deformation parameters ( @xmath46 ) for different variables and for different maps coupled in the system . in conclusion , @xmath0-deformation allows us to generate interesting families of maps and has potential utility in constructing iterated functional schemes to model low dimensional dynamical phenomena .",
