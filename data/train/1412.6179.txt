    "parameter estimation is a process of assessing unknown parameters with respect to a given limited amount of information .",
    "it is a procedure that is widely used in modeling and control of dynamical systems , where the applications range from biology to chemistry , physics and many others fields of science and engineering @xcite .    in real world applications ,",
    "many systems do exhibit partially or completely unknown parameters .",
    "knowledge about the time evolution of these parameters becomes the prerequisite to analyze , control , and predict the underlying dynamical behaviors .",
    "thus , this topic has drawn great attention in various areas due to its theoretical and practical significance .",
    "for example , in the biological networks , it is important to estimate unknown protein - dna interactions in the regulation of various cellular processes or detection of failures / anomalies . in aircraft / spacecraft dynamics ,",
    "estimation of the unknown states determines the fine line between stability and instability .",
    "another significant area of interest for parameter estimation problems is chaotic systems . in many real - life problems , ranging from information sciences to life sciences , from systems biology to quantum physics @xcite , nonlinear systems exhibit the phenomenon of chaos",
    ". an important application of chaos control and synchronization is parameter estimation through adaptive control methodologies . in this case",
    ", the aim is to estimate the uncertainties as well as minimize the synchronization error @xcite .",
    "however , such adaptive control methodology is associated with the stability and the synchronization regime of systems .",
    "it is also a relatively conservative methodology that is constrained by several conditions such as persistent excitation or linearly independence , to guarantee the convergence .    on the other hand ,",
    "receding horizon control @xcite is a branch of model predictive control methodology that aims to obtain an optimal feedback control law by minimizing the given performance index .",
    "the performance index of a receding - horizon control problem has a moving initial time and a moving terminal time , where the time interval of the performance index is finite . since the time interval of the performance index is finite , the optimal feedback law can be determined even for a system that is not stabilizable .",
    "the receding horizon optimal control problem can deal with a broader class of control objectives than asymptotic stabilization @xcite .",
    "the receding horizon control was originally applied to linear systems and then was extended to nonlinear systems @xcite . through its functionality ,",
    "nonlinear receding horizon control ( nrhc)@xcite has made an important impact on industrial control applications and is being increasingly applied in process controls .",
    "various advantages are known for nrhc , including the ability to handle time - varying and nonlinear systems , input / output constraints , associated plant uncertainties , and so on .    in recent years , many methods have been proposed for parameter estimation in nonlinear systems . some of them focused on using adaptive feedback control algorithms to estimate unknown parameters of nonlinear systems .",
    "huang @xcite studied the adaptive synchronization with application to parameter estimation .",
    "yu et al @xcite proposed the linear independence conditions to ensure the parameter convergence based on the lasalle invariance principle .",
    "however , most of these literatures @xcite on adaptive estimation impose an assumption that the parameters to be estimated are constant or slowly time - varying .",
    "moreover , the parameter estimation problem could be formed as an optimization problem , which leads to many intelligent optimization schemes : li et al .",
    "( @xcite ) proposed the chaotic ant swarm algorithm and conducted parameter estimation tests by using the lorenz system as an example .",
    "@xcite employed the particle swarm optimization method in parameter estimation .",
    "lin et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an oppositional seeker optimization algorithm with application to parameter estimation of chaotic systems .",
    "different from the above methods , in this paper , a method of parameter estimation for nonlinear systems is proposed based on real - time nonlinear receding horizon control ( nrhc ) methodology . with this approach",
    ", we provide a configuration which is especially applicable to chaotic and time varying systems . here , the estimation procedure is reduced to a family of finite horizon optimization control problems . to avoid high computational complexity ,",
    "the stabilized continuation method @xcite is employed , which is a non - iterative optimization procedure with moderate data storage capacity . based on this method , the nrhc problem",
    "is then solved by the backward sweep algorithm @xcite , in real time .",
    "the algorithm itself is executable regardless of controllability or stabilizability of the system , which is one of the powerful aspects of the approach .",
    "experimental results show that the real - time nrhc is applicable to the chaotic systems with unknown constant parameters as well as time - varying parameters .",
    "furthermore , we explore the noise reduction of the proposed method by simulations .    in the light of these facts ,",
    "the paper is organized as following : in section-[sec : prob_form ] , the problem formulation , based on nrhc , is defined as an estimation routine . in section-[sec : sec : backwards_sweep ] , brief background on previous work of ohtsuka s @xcite is provided , and then stability analysis of this approach is discussed in section-[sec : sec : conv_stab_analysis ] .",
    "we demonstrate the power of nrhc as an estimation routine through specific applications on a chaotic system ( in this case lorenz oscillator @xcite ) with constant ( section-[sec : sec : app2chaotic_sys_const_params ] ) and time varying parameters ( section-[sec : sec : app2chaotic_sys_timevar_params ] )",
    ". we also test and demonstrate robustness properties of nrhc algorithm in presence of noise , in section-[sec : sec : app2chaotic_sys_noise ] . at the end , with the discussions and conclusions ( section-[sec : conclusion ] ) , we finalize the paper .",
    "to demonstrate the parameter estimation routine of nonlinear systems , suppose that we are given the dynamical system representation as follows : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the state vector , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the linear coefficient matrix and nonlinear part of system presented in eq .",

    "the performance index is minimized for each time @xmath20 starting from @xmath23 .",
