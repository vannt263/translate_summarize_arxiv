    "it is remarkable that both early and late time completions of the standard model of the universe include phases of accelerated expansion .",
    "inflation  @xcite not only successfully addresses early time inconsistencies of the hot big bang , such as the flatness and horizon problems , but it also provides the mechanism of primordial perturbations needed for structure formation in the universe . on the other hand , the age crisis  @xcite in the standard cosmological model again asks for a late - time cosmic acceleration for its resolution in the standard lore .",
    "this phenomenon was directly confirmed by supernovae observations in 1998  @xcite , and it was indirectly supported by other probes thereafter  @xcite .",
    "such a confirmation for inflation is still awaited .",
    "the late - time cosmic acceleration can be caused by the cosmological constant  @xcite , with an energy scale of @xmath0  ev , or by a slowly - rolling scalar field ( quintessence ) with the mass of the order of @xmath1  ev  @xcite .",
    "both options are plagued with deep theoretical problems .",
    "concerning the cosmological constant , it is an `` unnatural '' parameter  @xcite of einstein theory , and its small numerical value at the classical level gets destabilized by quantum correction@xmath2vacuum energy .",
    "concerning the fundamental scalar field , it faces the same problem of `` naturalness '' . in minkowski space time",
    ", vacuum energy can be safely ignored by choosing normal ordering in quantum field theory . in this case , it neither influences the dynamics nor there is a known way to measure it in local experiments . however , in curved space time , vacuum energy adds to the energy momentum of matter and it contributes to the dynamics of spacetime geometry . in the important case of freidmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology ,",
    "geometry is conformally equivalent to minkowski spacetime and thus one might naively think that it has solved the cosmological constant problem . in this case , however , one is left with a scalar field non - minimally coupled to matter in flat spacetime  @xcite . hence , the cosmological problem translates into an equivalent problem of naturalness of the scalar field .    leaving the aforementioned problem aside ,",
    "if we opt for quintessence then a specific behavior of the scalar - field dynamics is required , in order to keep the thermal history of the universe intact . moreover ,",
    "if quintessence has originated from inflation in the early universe in an attempt to attribute both accelerating phases in the same scalar field ( quintessential inflation )  @xcite , then the scaling behavior of the scalar field is required in order to comply with the nucleosynthesis constraint .",
    "the exit from the scaling regime to the late - time acceleration can be caused by invoking the non - minimal coupling with massive neutrino matter  @xcite .",
    "it is really mysterious that the neutrino mass is around the mass scale associated with dark energy .",
    "once the non - minimal coupling to neutrino matter is invoked , the mass of the neutrino gets connected to the minimum of the effective potential and thereby to dark energy  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino mass modifies the cosmological evolution at both background and perturbation levels  @xcite . amongst others , the neutrino mass shifts",
    "the time of matter - radiation equality , and the free - streaming massive neutrino suppresses the growth of matter density perturbation within the free - streaming length scale  @xcite . it is well known that particle - physics experiments give rise to constraints on neutrino masses . on the other hand , cosmology provides an independent probe , which is however sensitive to the new degree(s ) of freedom over and above the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the massive neutrino matter crucially affects the matter power spectrum , and thus it can give rise to constraints on neutrino masses .",
    "in particular , the matter - density power spectrum is damped on small scales by massive neutrinos .",
    "having in mind the above discussion , it is both interesting and necessary to investigate the observational constraints on varying neutrino - mass cosmology .",
    "although observational constraints analysis on varying - mass neutrino cosmology has been performed in the past ( see for instance  @xcite ) the crucial new feature of our investigation is the incorporation of the non - minimal coupling . in particular",
    ", we shall investigate quintessence models based upon the tracker field with massive neutrino matter minimally as well as non - minimally coupled to the field .",
    "moreover , another novel feature is the use of the recently released planck and sdss data .",
    "the plan of the manuscript is the following : in section  [ sec:2 ] , we consider dark energy scenarios based upon scalar field models , with inverse power law and double exponential potentials with minimally coupled neutrino matter .",
    "section  [ model ] is devoted to the dynamics of a scaling field coupled to massive neutrino matter . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we present our results on the observational constraints on the above models .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the quintessence scenario is one of the main paradigms for the description of the late - time acceleration  @xcite . in this set up , along with cold dark matter and baryonic component , we shall also be interested in considering massive neutrino matter . as mentioned above , this class of models can give rise to quintessential inflation , such that the dark energy scale emerges naturally in the scenario .    before proceeding to non - minimal coupling with neutrino matter , we first briefly consider standard quintessence with minimally coupled massive neutrino matter . in order to set the notations ,",
    "let us consider the following standard action @xmath3 + s_m+ s_r \\ , , \\label{action00}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes the action of ordinary matter including non - relativistic and relativistic one .",
    "additionally , in order to describe the background cosmological evolution , we consider the spatially flat frw geometry , in which case the action ( [ action00 ] ) leads to the following evolution equations @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the energy density and pressure of the quintessence field . in this case as usual , the dark energy sector is attributed to @xmath8 and the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter reads as @xmath9 .    as mentioned in the introduction , specific features of scalar field dynamics such as tracker solutions",
    "are of interest in cosmology . in this case , once the conditions at the present epoch are set properly , cosmic evolution is not sensitive to the initial conditions . in",
    "what follows , we shall try to alleviate the problem associated with the said choice , for model parameters attributed to tracker solutions .    to make the point",
    ", we shall consider tracker solutions in the models with inverse power - law and double - exponential type potentials , though the underlying features are common to any tracker model .",
    "let us begin with the inverse power - law type potential  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a mass dimension - four constant . in this case",
    ", the slope of the potential is given by @xmath12 , which is large at early times and diminishes at late times when @xmath8 acquires large values .",
    "consequently , the field might mimic the background ( _ scaling solution _ ) at early epochs and could exit to slow roll at late times , giving rise to de sitter attractor _ a la a tracker solution_. as explained in the appendix , it is difficult to achieve tracker in this case for generic values of model parameters .",
    "for instance , for @xmath13 , one requires much larger value of @xmath14 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "it turns out that it is much easier to realize tracker in a model with the double exponential potential .",
    "let us consider the potential of the form  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath11 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants .",
    "for @xmath18 at the initial time ( @xmath19 ) , the second term in ( [ eq : potcosh ] ) can give rise to scaling regime for generic values of @xmath20 consistent with nucleosynthesis constraints of @xmath21  @xcite , where @xmath22 is the equation - of - state of the background fluid , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 in radiation and matter dominated epochs , respectively . on the other hand , for late times , when @xmath8 approaches the origin , ( [ eq : potcosh ] ) exhibits a minimum with @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the latter can suit our requirement if we choose @xmath27 .    in order to present the aforementioned behavior in a more transparent way",
    ", we numerically evolve the evolution equations and we depict the corresponding evolution in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . indeed , in the upper graph of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we depict the corresponding evolutions for the energy densities of radiation ( @xmath28 ) , matter ( @xmath29 ) and quintessence field ( @xmath30 ) , normalized to the matter energy density @xmath31 at present , as functions of @xmath32 , for three choices of @xmath11 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the lower graph of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we depict the corresponding evolution for the quintessence equation - of - state parameter @xmath33 . because the cosmic evolution is insensitive to the initial conditions in the exponential potential , we can choose initial values in a broad parameter space .",
    "in the calculation , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are set at @xmath36 .     at present ( @xmath37 ) , as functions of @xmath32 , for the minimally coupled scenario with the double - exponential potential @xmath38 : @xmath28 is the gray - dashed curve , @xmath29 is the gray - solid curve , and @xmath30 is plotted for three parameter choices , namely ( @xmath39)= @xmath40 ( blue - solid ) , ( @xmath41)= @xmath42 ( green - dashed ) and ( @xmath41)= @xmath43 ( red - dotted ) .",
    "right : the corresponding evolution of the quintessence equation - of - state parameter @xmath33 . we have used @xmath44 as the boundary condition . _ ]    as we observe , the density ratio @xmath45 , depending on @xmath17 in the early universe , does not change in radiation and matter dominated eras .",
    "finally , the behavior of @xmath8-field at early times , can be estimated by combining ( [ eq : quinteom ] ) and ( [ eq : potcosh ] ) , leading to @xmath46 .",
    "hence , as the scale of @xmath30 is close to @xmath11 , the quintessence field evolves into the @xmath47cdm - like stage , where @xmath48 .",
    "note that because the late - time behavior of the double exponential potential is almost the same as that of the @xmath47cdm model , this scenario is hardly distinguished from @xmath47cdm .",
    "we perform the cosmomc package  @xcite to extract the observational constraints and present the results of these two scenarios with one massive neutrino along with the other two being massless in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and table .",

    "we have examined the tracker quintessence models with inverse power - law and double - exponential potentials . in the first case ,",
    "it is difficult to obtain a viable scenario for generic values of model parameters , whereas in the second case we are forced to make a natural choice for the scale of the potential which brings back the problem that cosmological constant is plagued with . with a hope to alleviate the problem , we have considered massive neutrino matter non - minimally coupled to gravity . during radiation and early matter era , massive neutrinos exhibit relativistic behavior which implies vanishing coupling to scalar field . only at late times ,",
    "when massive neutrinos turn non - relativistic , their direct coupling to field builds up , leading to appearance of a minimum in the effective potential of the field . in this picture",
    ", the minimum of the effective potential is insensitive to the scale of the potential @xmath11 and is rather given by the numerical value of @xmath49 around the present epoch . at late times , when the scalar field rolls around the minimum of the effective potential , the dynamical system enters into scaling regime , which is an attractor .",
    "thanks to non - minimal coupling , the scaling solution is accelerating .",
    "clearly , the model under consideration has an edge over standard quintessence with flat potential .",
    "we have found that the neutrino mass grows in time and its mass in the past is smaller than the current stage . in the early universe ,",
    "the free - streaming length of the neutrino around the horizon scale is the same as that of the massless one . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figwtot ] , the neutrinos become massive only at the very recent epoch . as a result , our scenario can relax the suppression of the matter power spectrum from the free - streaming massive neutrino in the early universe .",
    "the constraint on the neutrino masses is reduced in comparison to @xmath47cdm . in particular",
    ", in the scenario under consideration , we found that the best - fit value of the neutrino mass sum are around @xmath50  ev , along with the allowed window extended to @xmath51  ev , which is consistent with particle physics experiments .",
