    "we do not ascribe physical meaning to any of the fit components .",
    "we simply aim to reconstruct the best overall model of the intrinsic , unblended , unabsorbed profile .",
    "we added fit components iteratively , only adding additional components when residual emission line flux from any part of the line  usually the peak  remained above the average continuum noise level after subtracting each fit component .",
    "spectra were fit interactively , but with an automated pipeline to better reproduce typical literature practices ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the automated pipeline set the continuum regions at restframe wavelengths 1435@xmath31465  and 1690@xmath31710 , although adjustments were made for the lowest redshift objects where the blue region fell at the noisy edge of the spectrum , for the presence of significant absorption from inspection of the first - epoch se spectrum or the coadded spectrum , or for chip defects in any spectrum .",
    "next , the region over which iv civ  was fit was set to rest frame wavelengths 1466@xmath31650 .",

    "first , fitting was interrupted to change or identify additional masking needs  most often for absorption .",
    "the identification and details of contaminating features are more easily discerned in higher s / n spectra , so a more hands - on approach to the fitting was allowed when the additional signal provided this information . as such , modifications to the boundaries and masks",
    "were optimized on an object - to - object basis .",
    "this was often possible only for the coadded spectra , but when applied to the se spectra , any masking or boundary changes were set by only the first - epoch spectrum and then kept the same for all additional epochs .",
    "common modifications were to widen the red shelf mask further to the blue or the size and/or location of the niv ]  and continuum masks to more optimal spectral regions .",
    "more detailed absorption line masks were also often needed in higher s / n spectra because weak absorption features were not always cleanly removed by the sigma - clipping procedure .",
    "manual intervention was also used to confirm when multiple components were needed to fit the profile .",
    "this was done for both the coadded spectrum and for every se spectrum .",
    "finally , the interactive process also allowed us to flag and then remove previously unidentified  dropped \" spectra from our analysis .",
    "these interactive steps likely increase the robustness of our fits compared to fully automated analyses of large survey samples for which it is infeasible to visually inspect the fits to every spectrum .    to prevent any unconscious bias in the way the se spectra were fit or masked for contaminating features",
    ", we fit the se spectra before fitting the coadded spectra .",
    "to do otherwise might bias our analysis because using the information from the higher s / n coadded spectra to inform treatment of the lower s / n se spectra is a luxury not afforded in typical analyses of survey - quality data .",

    "the emission line property measurements for all objects based on the coadded spectra are made directly from the profile fit to the coadded spectrum for that source .",
    "the uncertainties in these measurements are estimated by performing monte carlo simulations using the fit to the coadded spectrum .",
    "we create 500 mock spectra by resampling the flux in the gh polynomial fit based on gaussian deviates derived from the coadded error spectrum for each source .",

    "inspection of individual cases suggests that this bias ( and therefore the population separation with shape ) occurs when the wings of the emission line become mischaracterized because of contamination from the noise of the continuum .",
    "the predominant effect is that the profile defined by the gh polynomial fits becomes truncated at artificially lower velocities than inferred from the higher - s / n coadded spectrum .",
    "it is also possible that the continuum level is more accurately characterized in higher s / n data , leading to lower overall accuracy of the profile fit in the se spectrum as compared to the coadded .",
    "this former effect can clearly be seen in the example spectra shown in the left panels of figure  [ f_exampspec ] .",
    "another possible contributor to artificially truncated profile fits is blending of the iv civ  wings with the red shelf of iv civ .",
    "the profiles most affected by premature truncation due to both noise and blending are those with small values of the shape parameters , which corresponds to the profiles that are very ` peaky ' with strong narrow velocity cores and very broad wings .",
    "this bias is likely the driver for the trends between @xmath34 and the other line properties shown in figure  [ f_linepropquality ] , as well .",
    "we have investigated data - quality related statistical uncertainties and systematic biases in spectroscopic properties measured for high - redshift quasars .",
    "we have been particularly interested in properties of the iv civ  emission line , as this line is of interest for high - redshift bh - mass estimates .",
    "this investigation was only possible because of the availability of spectroscopic monitoring data taken by the sdss - rm project .",
    "taken individually , these spectra are representative of typical survey - quality data ; however , coadding produces a higher s / n spectrum , which can be used to make direct comparisons of the measurements of spectral properties between low and high - s / n spectra .",
    "our analysis shows that the statistical measurement uncertainties of all the iv civ  velocity width characterizations we consider ( fwhm , @xmath6 , and mad ) increase significantly , by a factor of 2@xmath33 , when going from high to low quality data ( see table [ t_widths ] , columns 4 and 5 , and fig .  [ f_widtherrors ] ) .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the bh - mass estimates , which depend on the line width squared , are therefore a factor of two larger than this .",
    "we also find the following systematic trends for the line - width characterizations we consider :      at low s / n , a systematic overestimation of the iv civ  fwhm measurements is introduced , although it is not significantly larger than the measurement uncertainties , on average .",
    "the observed bias can be attributed to inaccuracies in characterizing the emission - line peak flux level in noisy data ( see fig .",
    "[ f_widthscomparesnscatt ] and table 2 ) .",
    "uncharacterized absorption can exacerbate the fwhm biases ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the systematic bias can be severe in some cases .",
    "interestingly , similar s /",
    "n investigations into potential biases in fwhm measurements described by @xcite for a different sample suggest that the fwhm in low s / n data may be systematically underestimated when the profiles are described by multi - gaussian fits , so details of the bias may depend on the specific functional form used to fit the data .",
    "biases in @xmath6 at low s / n are less than those in the fwhm and scale with the statistical uncertainty . when present , underestimation of @xmath6 is caused mainly by the inability to accurately fit the emission line wings in the presence of a noisy continuum . as a result iv civ  profiles with ` peaky ' cores and extended wings are likely to be biased more significantly than ` stumpy ' or ` boxy ' profiles without extended wings ( figs .",
    "[ f_linepropquality ] and [ f_coaddseshapecompare ] ) .",
    "the systematic bias in the mad measurements was relatively smaller than for the fwhm and @xmath6 .",
    "the bias was also always well within the statistical uncertainties , and the distribution of @xmath33mad measurements remains relatively symmetric and centrally peaked with decreasing s / n ( see fig .",
    "[ f_plotmaddistr ] ) .",
    "these trends of fwhm and line dispersion measurements with s / n are consistent with the results for h@xmath9  from similar analyses presented by @xcite , but that study did not investigate the mad .",
    "we conclude here that the mad is the most reliable measure of the velocity width for low - quality data .",
    "nonetheless , further analysis is needed to investigate how good of a proxy this characterization is for the virial blr velocity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and se bh mass scaling relationships have not yet been developed and calibrated for this characterization .",
    "we also stress to the reader that the present study has only been focused on biases due to data - quality considerations .",
    "we make no preference for which line - width characterization is a _ better _ proxy for the reverberating blr velocity dispersion that traces the gravitational potential of the bh . the fwhm is often preferred because it is more simple to measure and less susceptible to the subjectiveness of deblending procedures . on the other hand ,",
    "recent studies @xcite have demonstrated that @xmath6 is less biased than fwhm for estimating iv civ  bh masses , which is least partially attributable to the presence of non - variable flux contributions to the iv civ  emission line and/or a continuum color term that are yet unaccounted for in iv civ - based bh mass scaling relation calibrations ( see also , for similar mgii  trends , and @xcite , for additional discussions ) .",
