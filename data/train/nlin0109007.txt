    "the investigation of nonequilibrium transport processes in many - particle systems generally requires to model the interaction between a particle and a thermal reservoir .",
    "a common approach for such a modeling are deterministic and time - reversible thermostats @xcite .",
    "conventional types of them , such as the gaussian and the nos - hoover thermostat , are based on introducing a momentum dependent friction coefficient into the microscopic equations of motion @xcite .",
    "though the microscopic equations of motion of these systems are time - reversible the macroscopic dynamics is irreversible in nonequilibrium leading to momentum and energy fluxes with well - defined transport coefficients @xcite , which appears to be a paradox .",
    "however , investigations of the microscopic dynamics with methods from dynamical system theory could resolve this paradox by showing that the microscopic dynamics is nonlinear and highly unstable @xcite and leads to a phase space volume contraction onto a fractal attractor @xcite .",
    "from the analysis of conventional thermostats , further relations between quantities characterizing the microscopic dynamics and quantities characterizing macroscopic transport could be established . at the heart of such relations",
    "there is an identity between phase space volume contraction and thermodynamic entropy production .",
    "on the basis of this identity the lyapunov exponents could be related to the transport coefficients of a system , which has been formulated as the lyapunov sum rule @xcite .",
    "these characteristic features of thermostated many - particle systems have been recovered for specific one - particle systems , the gaussian thermostated periodic lorentz gas @xcite and the nos - hoover thermostated periodic lorentz gas @xcite .",
    "the periodic lorentz gas consists of a particle that moves through a triangular lattice of hard disks and is elastically reflected at each disk collision .",
    "it serves as a standard model in the field of chaos and transport @xcite .",
    "the advantage of a one - particle system is that it reflects more strongly and transparently the nonequilibrium properties induced by a thermostat .",
    "for this reason the lorentz gas appears as an appropriate tool to compare the properties of nonequilibrium steady states obtained from different deterministic and time - reversible thermostating mechanisms .",
    "the study of different models describing the interaction between particles and thermal reservoir and the identification of their common properties is crucial to obtain a general characterization of nonequilibrium steady states .    to investigate whether the nonequilibrium properties of conventional deterministic and time - reversible thermostats are of general validity , or just characterize these specific types of systems , an alternative deterministic and time - reversible thermostat called thermostating by deterministic scattering has been introduced for the periodic lorentz gas @xcite .",
    "this thermostat is based on specifically modeling the energy transfer related to a microscopic collision process between particle and disk , where the disk mimics a thermal reservoir with infinitely many degrees of freedom . in nonequilibrium under an external electric field this mechanism leads to an on average constant kinetic energy of the particle resulting in a nonequilibrium steady state . furthermore , the phase space volume contracts onto an attractor similar to the multifractal attractor found for the gaussian thermostated lorentz gas .",
    "however , differences appear in the bifurcation diagram and in the field dependence of the conductivity .",
    "this alternative thermostat has later been applied to a heat and shear flow @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on the microscopic properties of thermostating by deterministic scattering in the periodic lorentz gas by numerically calculating the lyapunov exponents . as quantities from dynamical systems",
    "theory , lyapunov exponents allow a detailed characterization of the microscopic stability . in particular , they will enable us to check the general validity of relations between quantities from dynamical systems theory and statistical mechanics as obtained for conventional deterministic and time - reversible thermostats .",
    "we first explain the algorithm to calculate the lyapunov exponents for the lorentz gas as thermostated by deterministic scattering .",
    "numerical computations will then show that the standard gram - schmidt orthonormalization has to be modified resulting in a variant of this method called constraint orthonormalization . beside the results for the lyapunov exponents we present results for the kaplan - yorke dimension and for the phase space volume contraction .",
    "we compare these results as obtained for our model with the results as known for the gaussian thermostated lorentz gas @xcite , and with results for a heat and shear flow thermostated by deterministic scattering @xcite .",
    "finally , we check whether the phase space volume contraction is equal to the thermodynamic entropy production and whether the lyapunov sum rule holds for our mechanism .",

    "these data appear to be at variance with the fact that in equilibrium two zero lyapunov exponents have to exist , one associated with the direction of the flow , and a second one resulting from the conjugate pairing rule in equilibrium @xcite .",

    "we have numerically calculated the lyapunov exponents by investigating the dynamics of a trajectory and four satellite trajectories , i.  e. , for finite but small distances .",

    "we have followed the temporal evolution of two points on the same trajectory for about 20 collisions without orthonormalization and by choosing as initial conditions a ) that the points are slightly displaced along the trajectory but have the same velocity , b ) that the points have the same configuration space coordinates but slightly different velocities .",

    "thus , there must be a numerical problem because of standard gram - schmidt orthonormalization which establishes an orthonormal system of the tangent vectors on the basis of the most unstable direction . to cure that problem",
    ", we propose an alternative method to perform the periodic orthonormalization .",
    "this method establishes an orthonormal system of the tangent vectors starting from the existing neutral direction of the flow . since we are introducing an additional constraint this way we call it constraint orthonormalization .",
    "it consists of the following steps :    1",
    ".   choose suitable initial conditions for the orthonormal system : the first tangent vector is situated in the direction of the flow , @xmath96 , and the other tangent vectors are orthonormal to it .",
    "2 .   at every orthonormalization the first tangent vector",
    "is forced to point in the direction of the flow , @xmath97 .",
    "this step corrects the very small deviations of the first tangent vector from the direction of the flow resulting from a collision with the disk , as will be explained in more detail below .",
    "3 .   the second",
    ", third and fourth tangent vector are orthonormalized again starting from the first one according to the method of gram - schmidt .",
    "the application of constraint orthonormalization leads to the following lyapunov spectrum in equilibrium : @xmath98 , see also fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . comparing these results to the previous ones obtained from the standard method shows that the gram - schmidt orthonormalization led to a wrong result only for the second and third lyapunov exponent .",
    "the explanation for this numerical problem is as follows : in equilibrium the average energy transfer to the reservoir is zero .",
    "still , at any collision energy is transfered either from the particle to the reservoir or in the opposite direction . according to eq .",
    "( [ pcon ] ) the phase space volume thus _ locally _ contracts or expands although the _ global _ phase space volume contraction is zero .",
    "however , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ pscl ] ) the phase space contraction is intimately related to the corresponding ( un)stable directions in phase space .",
    "consequently , the local contractions and expansions at a collision change the orientation and the norm of the tangent vectors in a nontrivial way .",
    "the gram - schmidt orthonormalization reacts to these changes by turning the corresponding tangent vectors out of the previously neutral directions .",
    "the problem why the gram - schmidt procedure does not converge to the existing two neutral directions at least in the long time limit could not be completely resolved even by very detailed numerical investigations of the dynamics .",
    "possibly some kind of resonance phenomenon between local phase space contraction and expansion at the collision and gram - schmidt orthonormalization after the collision leads to the corresponding tangent vectors adjusting themselves somewhat symmetrically around these two neutral directions @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "constraint orthonormalization correctly yields a second zero lyapunov exponent beside the zero lyapunov exponent corresponding to the constrained direction of the flow . in agreement with the on average zero energy transfer between particle and reservoir",
    "the sum of the lyapunov exponents and the global phase space volume contraction are zero .",
    "furthermore , the lyapunov exponents trivially fulfill the conjugate pairing rule related to the hamiltonian character of the dynamics in equilibrium .",
    "the probability density in the lorentz gas cell is uniform in equilibrium and , as a consequence , the kaplan - yorke dimension is equal to the dimension of the phase space , @xmath99 .",
    "in addition , the parametric temperature @xmath24 , the temperature in the bulk @xmath61 , and the reservoir temperature @xmath60 , are all equal , @xmath100 .",
    "we now turn to an even more detailed analysis of the dynamical instability of our model system by following ideas summarized in refs .  @xcite .",
    "if a dynamical system is ergodic , the lyapunov exponents do not depend on the initial conditions of the tangent vectors , and thus they only yield information about the global instability .",
    "this implies that eq .",
    "( [ ljap ] ) provides no direct way to assess the local instability of the system at specific values of phase space variables like the angle of incidence at a disk @xmath20 and the position of the colliding particle @xmath30 . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "two slightly different ways have been proposed how to access information on local instabilities depending on these parameters .",
    "here we use the approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite which characterizes the local deformation of a typical tangent vector @xmath101 at the moment of a collision by introducing the quantity @xmath102 where the brackets indicate an average over all collisions in a respective small interval around @xmath30 and/or @xmath20 .",
    "the physical motivation for defining this quantity is that any tangent vector quickly orients itself into the direction of fastest growth .",
    "accordingly , the full memory about the maximum instability of the system is contained in the orientation of the tangent vector thus representing a `` needle '' in phase space which very sensitively measures the local changes of the stability at a collision .",
    "therefore , this quantity is a very sensitive function of @xmath20 and @xmath30 . in ref .",

    "the distribution of peaks in @xmath124 and @xmath125 is very similar .",
    "this might be related to the fact that both quantities illustrate somewhat irregular behavior : @xmath103 characterizes the instability of the dynamics and @xmath60 is equal to the mean kinetic energy of the degrees of freedom of the reservoir .",
    "the analogous @xmath30-dependence of @xmath126 and @xmath60 points again to a close relation between dynamical system theory and statistical mechanics . at @xmath123",
    "both the distributions of @xmath103 and @xmath127 show a more complicated structure .",

    "more detailed information related to the deviations between reservoir temperature and parametric temperature are obtained by studying the map densities @xmath130 and @xmath131 at a collision as represented in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the deviations between ingoing and outgoing densities in both cases are reminiscent of an average transfer of kinetic energy from particle to reservoir , as it is necessary to compensate the influx of energy caused by the electric field to obtain a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "however , in case of the periodic lorentz gas taking the thermodynamic limit leaves the system precisely as it is .",
    "consequently , there is no thermodynamic way to get rid of the difference between ingoing and outgoing velocity distribution .",
    "but these differences are the dynamical reason why in nonequilibrium the reservoir temperature @xmath60 is typically not equal to the parametric temperature @xmath24 , because this would only be the case if both distributions would be converging to the ( local ) equilibrium distribution in the thermodynamic limit , as included in these figures .",
    "this aspect will become important for understanding our results on the relation between phase space contraction and entropy production below .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the kinetic energy of the particle in the bulk averaged over @xmath30 , @xmath132 , is presented as a function of the distance @xmath0 from the disk .",

    ", @xmath133 should approach the temperature of the reservoir defined via equipartitioning of energy thus providing an alternative definition of the reservoir temperature based on the bulk dynamics in the inner ring around the disk .",
    "however , it is not possible to safely extrapolate to this limiting value on the basis of the present data @xcite . comparing @xmath133 for @xmath135 with @xmath60 shows in particular that @xmath136 for @xmath137 excluding convergence via extrapolation , i.e. , the assumptions made in the derivation of eq .",

    ", work is transformed into heat and in turn removed by the thermostat leading to a positive thermodynamic entropy production .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ iep ] ) , the irreversible entropy production in the bulk @xmath58 is easily computed by defining the heat production @xmath140 as the change of the kinetic energy of the particle in the bulk , @xmath141 , and feeding in the bulk equations of motion eq .",
    "( [ eqm ] ) .",
    "this leads to the well - known expression of entropy production via joule heating @xmath142 the numerical result for the field dependence of the thermodynamic entropy production according to this equation is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed above the heat produced in the bulk must leave as an outward flux across the walls absorbed by the thermal reservoir .",
    "correspondingly , computing the average change of the kinetic energy during a free flight from the equations of motion yields @xmath143 where the right hand side is just the average transfer of kinetic energy at a collision . inserting this result into eq .",

    ", these two quantities just differ by the factor @xmath145 , @xmath146 to explicitly compare these two quantities the field dependence of @xmath147 is also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) . as we have discussed above",
    ", there is some ambiguity in defining the reservoir temperature @xmath60 , however , we emphasize that all our applied definitions and bounds lead to the result that @xmath147 and @xmath58 are inherently different in nonequilibrium .",
    "this is also clear from the fact how the thermostat works in our model , as explained above .    as has been done in conventional thermostats , starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) a relation between the electrical conductivity and the phase space volume contraction can now be established by using eq .",
    "( [ jou ] ) and replacing the average current according to the definition of the conductivity @xmath148 yielding @xmath149 this equation is formally identical to the lyapunov sum rule obtained for the conventional thermostats .",
    "the only difference is the constant factor @xmath24 which , for conventional thermostats , corresponds to the temperature of the reservoir .",
    "if the lyapunov sum rule applies , it shows that macroscopic transport can be directly understood in terms of the microscopic dynamics characterized by the sum of the lyapunov exponents .    however , we remark that the existence of a lyapunov sum rule in thermostated systems being of the simple type as one above rather seems to be the exception than the rule : for example , a difference between phase space volume contraction and thermodynamic entropy production has also been obtained for a shear flow as thermostated by deterministic scattering @xcite . for this system",
    "the expressions for @xmath44 and @xmath58 can be rather complicated .",
    "consequently , the lyapunov sum rule does not hold , and a similar relation has not been found in addition . furthermore , already a variation of the nos - hoover and of the gaussian thermostat did not lead to an identity between @xmath44 and @xmath58 implying the invalidity of the lyapunov sum rule as well , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in general , the relation between phase space volume contraction and thermodynamic entropy production , and the corresponding relation between transport coefficient and lyapunov exponents , will depend on the details of the microscopic energy transfer between particle and reservoir . based on our studies in refs .",
    "@xcite , we conclude that an identity between @xmath44 and @xmath58 appears only to be valid for what might be called `` ideal '' thermostats meaning that energy is exchanged between subsystem and reservoir by sufficiently simple coupling rules as they are provided , for example by conventional gaussian and nose - hoover thermostats .",
    "in this work we have numerically calculated the lyapunov exponents for the lorentz gas thermostated by deterministic scattering .",
    "the gram - schmidt orthonormalization , a fundamental ingredience of the standard method to calculate lyapunov exponents , led to a wrong result for the lyapunov spectrum by applying this thermostat .",
    "we modified this method by imposing an additional constraint , summarized as constraint orthonormalization , and found results which are in agreement with expectations from dynamical systems theory .",
    "we wish to remark that the phenomenon causing our numerical difficulties is reminiscent of an inelastic collision of a particle with a hard disk , as it is also modeled in granular materials by using restitution coefficients .",
    "thus , applying constraint orthonormalization might be helpful for exactly computing lyapunov spectra in low - dimensional systems of granular type as well .",
    "on the basis of the lyapunov exponents further quantities have been calculated to characterize the nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained for thermostating by deterministic scattering with the ones known for conventional thermostats leads to the following conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "the sum of the lyapunov exponents for thermostating by deterministic scattering is negative in nonequilibrium in agreement with the phase space volume contraction onto an attractor . for thermostating by deterministic scattering",
    "only one lyapunov exponent is zero in nonequilibrium related to the direction of the flow .",
    "similar results could be expected for the nos - hoover thermostated lorentz gas where the calculation of the lyapunov exponents have not yet been performed .",
    "in contrast , for the gaussian thermostated lorentz gas two lyapunov exponents are zero in nonequilibrium because the thermostat keeps the kinetic energy of the particle strictly constant .",
    "the kaplan - yorke dimension calculated on the basis of the lyapunov exponent is not an integer in nonequilibrium providing quantitative evidence that the attractor of thermostating by deterministic scattering in the periodic lorentz gas exhibits a fractal structure analogous to the conventional bulk thermostats .",
    "the identity between thermodynamic entropy production and phase space volume contraction does not hold for thermostating by deterministic scattering . instead , these two quantities differ by a field dependent factor .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the temperature of the reservoir of thermostating by deterministic scattering depends on the field strength , in contrast to gaussian and nos - hoover thermostats .",
    "this result is important , since this identity was accepted up to now as a general characterization of nonequilibrium steady states generated by deterministic and time - reversible thermostats .    \\4 .",
    "surprisingly , although there is no identity we could still establish a relation between conductivity and lyapunov exponents for thermostating by deterministic scattering .",
    "this equation is formally identical to the lyapunov sum rule for conventional thermostats . as far as we know",
    ", our model thus provides a first example of a system where there is no identity , but where nevertheless there is a simple relation between transport coefficients and dynamical instabilities similar to conventional thermostats .    in summary , we find that the existence of fractal attractors in nonequilibrium steady states are common features which thermostating by deterministic scattering shares with conventional thermostats . physically speaking , the fractal character reflects the extreme rarity of nonequilibrium states relative to equilibrium ones . to look for additional common properties of all deterministic and time - reversible thermostats remains an important question , which is intimately related to obtaining a general characterization of nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "such a characterization might result in a more general relation between quantities of thermodynamic interest and the indicators of dynamical chaos at the microscopic level , from which the relations obtained for the thermostating mechanisms considered above could appear as special cases .",
