    "the concern of this paper is the effect of a rough boundary on a viscous fluid . in most situations of physical relevance",
    ", such effect can not be described in detail : either the precise shape of the roughness is unknown , or its spatial variations are too small for computational grids .",
    "therefore , one may only hope to account for the averaged effect of the irregularities .",
    "this is the purpose of _ wall laws _ : the irregular boundary is replaced by an artificial smoothed one , and an artificial boundary condition ( a wall law ) is prescribed there , that should reflect the mean impact of the roughness .",
    "this paper is a mathematical study of wall laws , in the following simple setting : we consider a two - dimensional rough channel @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the _ smooth part _ , @xmath7 is the rough part , and @xmath8 their interface .",
    "we assume that the rough part has typical size @xmath9 , that is @xmath10 for a @xmath11lipschitz function @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "more will be assumed on the boundary function @xmath14 hereafter ( see figure for an example of such a rough domain ) .",
    "we assume that in this channel domain , the viscous fluid obeys to the stationary incompressible navier - stokes equations : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes any vertical cross - section of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the third equation in expresses that a flux @xmath19 is imposed across the channel .",
    "note that this flux does not depend on the cross - section , due to the incompressibility and no - slip condition at the boundary .",
    "we also stress that , up to minor changes , we could apply our analysis to many variants of this problem , notably to elliptic type systems or to unstationary navier - stokes .    in this simple",
    "setting , the search for wall laws resumes to the following problem : to find a boundary operator @xmath20 , regular in @xmath9 , acting at the _ artificial _ boundary @xmath21 , such that the solution of @xmath22 approximates well the solution @xmath23 of in @xmath24 .",
    "this type of homogenization problems has been considered in many mathematical works .",
    "on wall laws for scalar elliptic equations , we refer to @xcite . on wall laws for fluid flows , see @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite on porous boundaries .",
    "these works go along with more formal computations , grounded by empirical arguments ( _ cf _ for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we finally mention @xcite for the study of roughness - induced effects on geophysical systems .",
    "all these studies have been carried under two assumptions :    * compact domains , for instance bounded channels or periodic in the variable @xmath25 . * _ periodic irregularities _ , meaning that the boundary function @xmath14 is periodic .",
    "the first restriction is just a small mathematical convenience , that gives direct compactness properties through rellich type theorems .",
    "the second assumption is of course a big simplification , both from the point of view of mathematics and physics .",
    "these assumptions were considerably relaxed in the recent article @xcite by a. basson and the author . as the present note extends this article , we now describe shortly its main results and underlying difficulties .    in all papers on wall laws ,",
    "the starting point is a formal expansion of @xmath23 : @xmath26 formally , the leading term @xmath27 satisfies with the simple no - slip condition @xmath28 the solution of this approximate system is the famous poiseuille flow : @xmath29 note that @xmath27 is defined in all @xmath30 .",
    "this zeroth order asymptotics can be mathematically justified , at least for small fluxes @xmath19 : we prove in article @xcite    [ direstimates ] there exists @xmath31 , such that for all @xmath32 , system has a unique solution @xmath23 in @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , @xmath34    we stress that these estimates hold without further assumption on the boundary : we only assume that @xmath14 has values in @xmath35 and is @xmath11lip .",
    "a look at the proof shows that the constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 are only increasing functions of @xmath38 .    theorem [ direstimates ] expresses that the wall law provides a @xmath39 approximation of @xmath23 in @xmath40 .",
    "see also @xcite for a similar result in a bounded channel .",
    "however , this wall law does not account for the behaviour of @xmath23 near the boundary , and can therefore be refined . indeed ,",
    "as the poiseuille flow @xmath27 does not vanish at the lower part of @xmath41 , a boundary layer corrector @xmath42 must be added to the expansion .",
    "the ( normalized ) boundary layer @xmath43 is defined on the rescaled infinite domain @xmath44 and formally satisfies the following stokes problem @xmath45 note the inhomogeneous dirichlet condition , that cancels the trace of @xmath27 .    .",
    "first , the well - posedness is not clear .",
    "as the boundary function @xmath14 is not decreasing at infinity , one can expect only local integrability of the solution @xmath46 in variable @xmath47 .",
    "the derivation of local bounds is not obvious : the stokes operator being vectorial , one can not use scalar tools such as the maximum principle or harnack inequality .",
    "moreover , as @xmath48 is unbounded in all directions , the poincar inequality ( which allows to get @xmath49 estimates in the channel ) is not available .",
    "besides the well - posedness issue , the qualitative properties of @xmath46 seem also out of reach without further hypothesis .    under an assumption of periodic irregularities",
    ", the analysis of becomes straightforward . if @xmath14 is say @xmath50 periodic in @xmath47 , it is easy to show well - posedness in the space @xmath51 moreover , a simple fourier transform in @xmath47 shows that @xmath52 that is exponential convergence to a constant field @xmath53 at infinity .",
    "the constant @xmath54 at infinity is then responsible for a @xmath39 tangential slip .",
    "namely , chosing as a wall law the navier - slip condition @xmath55 it can be shown ( in this periodic framework ) that the solution of provides a @xmath4 approximation of @xmath23 in @xmath3 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for all necessary details .",
    "the error estimate @xmath56 comes from the fact that the boundary layer term satisfies @xmath57 .",
    "the periodicity hypothesis is a stringent one , and one may wonder if the use of navier slip condition can be justified in more general configurations .",
    "this issue has been adressed rigorously in the recent article @xcite .",
    "inspired by the probabilistic modeling of heterogeneous media ( see for instance @xcite ) , we considered irregularities that are not distributed periodically , but randomly , following a stationary stochastic process .",
    "namely , the rough boundary is seen as a realization of a stationary spatial process . following the well - known construction of kolmogorov ,",
    "this amounts to consider the space @xmath58 of all possible rough boundaries , together with the cylindrical @xmath59 field @xmath60 ( that is generated by the coordinates @xmath61 ) and with a stationary measure @xmath62 .",
    "stationary means that @xmath62 is invariant by the group of translation @xmath63 as a consequence of this modeling , the domains @xmath17 , @xmath48 , as well as the velocity fields @xmath23 or @xmath46 depend on the parameter @xmath14 . as discussed earlier , the existence result and estimates of theorem [ direstimates ] are uniform on @xmath64 . moreover ,",
    "it was shown in article @xcite that the function @xmath65 ( extended by @xmath66 outside @xmath67 ) is measurable as a function from @xmath64 to @xmath68 .    using this probabilistic structure ,",
    "we have been able to extend partially the results of the periodic case .",
    "key elements of our analysis are :    * the well - posedness of the boundary layer system , obtained in functional spaces encoding the relation @xmath69 * the convergence of @xmath70 to @xmath71 as @xmath72 , both in @xmath73 and almost surely , locally uniformly in @xmath47 .",
    "such convergence is deduced from the ergodic theorem .",
    "more on the boundary layer system will be provided in the next sections . as regards the navier wall law , the main result of @xcite resumes to    [ navestimates ] there exists @xmath74 such that the solution @xmath75 of , satisfies @xmath76    we remind that @xmath77    theorem [ navestimates ] shows that a slip condition of navier type improves the approximation of @xmath23 . as in the periodic case ,",
    "the random variable @xmath54 in comes from the convergence of the boundary layer @xmath46 .",
    "if the measure @xmath62 is ergodic , @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath14 , as pointed out in @xcite .    a natural concern about this result",
    "is the @xmath78 bound , which is only a slight improvement of the @xmath39 in theorem [ direstimates ] .",
    "a look at article @xcite shows that this poor bound is due to the lack of information on the way @xmath46 converges at infinity .",
    "contrary to the periodic case , where convergence at exponential rate is established , the simple use of the ergodic theorem does not yield any speed rate .",
    "the present paper aims at clarifying this point .",
    "losely , _ we will show that for a large class of boundaries , the navier wall law provides a latexmath:[$o({{\\varepsilon}}^{3/2 }    namely , we will make the two following assumptions on our random roughness : + _ ( h1 ) the measure @xmath62 is supported by @xmath80 for some @xmath81 and some @xmath82 . _",
    "+ _ ( h2 ) the randon boundary has no correlation at large distances , that is the @xmath83-fields @xmath84 are independent for @xmath85 , for some @xmath86 . _",
    "+ under these assumptions , the main theorem of the paper reads :    [ refinedestimate ] for small enough @xmath19 and under ( h1)-(h2 ) , the following refined estimate holds : @xmath87    before entering the proof of this theorem , let us give a few hints .",
    "theorem [ refinedestimate ] is deduced from a central limit theorem for the quantity @xmath88 .",
    "broadly , this theorem comes from good properties of the random variables @xmath89 due to the elliptic nature of the stokes operator , such random variables are not independent .",
    "however , under assumption ( h2 ) , we are able to prove that the correlation terms @xmath90 decay fast enough as @xmath91 . as a result , one can prove a central limit theorem on @xmath92 , and then a similar one on @xmath93 .",
    "we point out that such type of results for dependent variables with strong decay of correlations is quite classical and has been used in various fields .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a review paper related to dynamical systems , and to recent articles @xcite for applications in a pde context .    as a consequence of this central limit theorem",
    ", we show that the boundary layer converges to a constant as @xmath94 .",
    "note that this is in sharp contrast with the periodic case , where exponential convergence holds ( we stress that periodic boundaries are highly correlated , thus far from satisfying ( h2)).this speed of convergence is resposible for the @xmath95 in the navier wall law .",
    "the main difficulty is to obtain the decay of correlations of variables like @xmath92 .",
    "the proof relies on precise estimates of the green function for the stokes operator above a non flat boundary .",
    "such estimates follow from sharp elliptic regularity results , where one must pay attention to the oscillation of the boundary .",
    "this is achieved under the regularity assumption ( h1 ) , using ideas of avellaneda and lin for homogenization of elliptic systems @xcite .",
    "in this section , we explain how theorem [ navestimates ] follows from estimates on the solution @xmath46 of .",
    "such estimates will be established in the following sections . at first , we remind the main features of @xmath46 , as stated in article @xcite .      as emphasized in the introduction , to solve in a deterministic way , that is for each possible boundary @xmath14 , is still unclear .",
    "hence , one must take advantage of the probabilistic setting . first ,",
    "notice that a reasonable solution @xmath46 should satisfy : @xmath96 together with the stationarity assumption , this relation sort of substitutes to the identity @xmath97 used in the treatment of @xmath98periodic roughness .",
    "it allows to extend the well - posedness result , through an appropriate variational formulation .",
    "this formulation has been described in article @xcite .",
    "first , one introduces the new unknown @xmath99 and replace system by @xmath100\\vert_{y_2 = 0 } = 0 , \\quad [ { { \\partial}}_2 w - ( 0,q)]\\vert_{y_2 = 0 } =   ( -1,0 ) ,    \\end{aligned } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath101\\vert_{y_2 = 0}$ ] denotes the jump at @xmath102 .",
    "then , one multiplies formally the stokes equation by a test function @xmath103 that satisfies @xmath104 , @xmath105 . integrating by parts over @xmath106 yields @xmath107 finally , if @xmath108 , @xmath109 satisfy relation , one can integrate with respect to @xmath14 , and thanks to the stationarity of @xmath62 , get rid of the annoying boundary term at the r.h.s : @xmath110    afterwards , this formal variational formulation can be rigorously defined and solved : in short , one can apply the riesz theorem in a functional space of sobolev type , made of functions @xmath108 such that @xmath111 and satisfying almost surely , together with @xmath112 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for all details .",
    "note that stationarity implies : @xmath113    back to the original system , this variational solution @xmath108 provides almost surely a solution @xmath114 in the sense of distributions .",
    "moreover , the ergodic theorem yields ( see @xcite ) @xmath115    in order to understand the origin of the navier approximation , the next step is to describe the behavior of @xmath46 as @xmath116 . for periodic roughness , one can show exponential convergence of @xmath46 to a constant vector field @xmath117 .",
    "however , the rate of convergence goes to zero with the period @xmath50 .",
    "when dealing with stationary random boundaries , that broadly speaking contain all periods , the exponential decay does not hold _ a priori_. in other words , there is a problem associated to the fourier spectrum , that is discrete in the periodic case , and may accumulate to zero in the random case .",
    "again , this problem has been ( partially ) overcome in @xcite .",
    "the first step is to obtain a representation of @xmath46 in terms of a stokes double layer potential , _ cf _ proposition ? ? . almost surely , for any @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the poisson type kernel for the stokes operator over a half space .",
    "then , the ergodic theorem and a few calculations yield : @xmath120 where the convergence holds almost surely ( locally uniformly in @xmath47 ) , as well as in @xmath73 ( uniformly in @xmath47 ) . in the case where the stationary measure @xmath62 is ergodic ,",
    "the constant @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath14 . finally , back to the integral representation , and with similar treatment for derivatives of @xmath46 : @xmath121 { } \\ : 0.\\ ] ] we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 13 ) for all details .",
    "most of the analysis of the present paper will be devoted to a refined asymptotic estimate of the boundary layer :    [ theosharp ] under assumptions ( h1 ) , ( h2 ) , for all @xmath122 , @xmath123 { } \\sigma_\\beta \\ge 0.\\ ] ]    it is of course a much sharper convergence result than . before tackling its proof ,",
    "we explain how it implies theorem [ navestimates ] .",
    "arguments are direct adaptation from section 5 in @xcite .    on the basis of the boundary layer analysis",
    ", one can build an approximation of @xmath23 of boundary layer type .",
    "namely , we introduce @xmath124 in this approximation , @xmath27 is the poiseuille flow and @xmath125 is the boundary layer solution of . as @xmath46 does not converge to zero at infinity , we add a large scale corrector @xmath126 satisfying : @xmath127 it is just a combination of a couette and a poiseuille flow : @xmath128 .",
    "still , this approximation does not vanish at the boundary , which explains the addition of another term @xmath129 .",
    "it must satisfy @xmath130 this remainder can be taken small in the sense of    this problem possesses a ( non unique ) solution @xmath131 such that @xmath132    _ proof : _ the proof of this result mimics the one of proposition 14 in @xcite .",
    "the corrector @xmath131 can be chosen in the form @xmath133 the streamfunction @xmath134 is determined up to a constant and polynomial in @xmath135 .",
    "its coefficients have explicit dependence on @xmath136 .",
    "hence , the @xmath137 estimate on @xmath131 follows from the control of various terms involving @xmath136 . for instance",
    ", one must bound the @xmath138 norm of @xmath139 where the last equality comes from the stokes formula .",
    "using stationarity of @xmath62 , we get @xmath140 thanks to the refined estimate , we finally obtain @xmath141 all other terms involve similar computations .",
    "these are straightforwardly adapted from the proof of proposition 14 in @xcite , using instead of .",
    "once the approximate solution @xmath142 is built , one can obtain by energy estimates the following bounds , for @xmath19 small enough : @xmath143 which of course imply theorem [ navestimates ] . as the proof is very similar to what was done in paper @xcite",
    ", we do not expand more and refer to it for all details .",
    "up to the end of the paper , we will assume ( h1)-(h2 ) , and focus on theorem [ theosharp ] .",

    "the basic idea is that one can extend the central limit theorem to non independent sequences that feature a good decay of correlations as @xmath181 goes to infinity .",
