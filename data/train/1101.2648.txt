    "@xmath21 of @xmath1 are the fundamental groups of the ordered and the unordered configuration spaces of @xmath1 , that is , @xmath22 abrams showed in @xcite that discrete configuration spaces @xmath18 and @xmath19 are cubical complexes of non - positive curvature and so locally cat(0 ) spaces .",
    "in particular , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are eilenberg - maclane spaces , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are torsion - free . furthermore , @xmath23    conceiving applications to robotics , abrams and ghrist @xcite began to study configuration spaces over graphs and graph braid groups around 2000 in the topological point of view .",
    "research on graph braid groups has mainly been concentrated on characteristics of their presentations .",
    "an outstanding question was which graph braid group is a right - angled artin group .",
    "the precise characterization of such graphs was given in @xcite for @xmath24 by extending the result in @xcite for trees and @xmath25 .",
    "so it is natural to consider two other classes of groups defined by relaxing the requirement of right - angled artin groups that have a presentation whose relators are commutators of generators .",
    "simple - commutator - related group _ has a presentation whose relators are commutators , and a _ commutator - related group _ has a presentation whose relators are words of commutators .",
    "farley and sabalka proved in @xcite that @xmath26 is simple - commutator - related if every pair of cycles in @xmath1 are disjoint and they conjectured that @xmath26 is simple - commutator - related whose relators are related to two disjoints cycles if @xmath1 is planar .",
    "on the other hand , farley showed in @xcite that the homology groups of the unordered configuration space @xmath27 for a tree @xmath28 are torsion free and computed their ranks .",
    "kim , ko and park proved that if @xmath1 is non - planar , @xmath29 has a 2-torsion and the converse holds for @xmath30 and they conjectured that @xmath31 is torsion free iff @xmath1 is planar @xcite .",

    "furthermore , farber and hanbury showed in @xcite that for a non - planar graph @xmath1 satisfying a certain condition ( which also implies that @xmath1 is a simple and triconnected graph ) , @xmath34 . they also conjectured that @xmath35 is always torsion free and that @xmath34 iff @xmath1 is non - planar , simple and triconnected ( this is equivalent to their hypothesis ) .    in this article",
    ", we express @xmath29 and @xmath35 for an finite connected graph @xmath1 in terms of graph theoretic invariants ( see theorem  [ thm : h1bn ] and theorem  [ thm : h1pb2 ] ) .",
    "all the results and the conjectures , mentioned above , on the first homologies of configuration spaces over graphs are immediate consequences of these expressions .",
    "in addition , we prove that @xmath21 is commutator - related for a planar graph @xmath1 and @xmath36 is always commutator - related ( see theorem  [ thm : crg ] ) . by combining with a result of @xcite , we finally prove that for a planar graph @xmath1 , @xmath26 and @xmath36 are simple - commutator - related whose relators are commutators of words corresponding to two disjoint cycles on @xmath1 ( see theorem  [ thm : presentationforn2 ] ) .",
    "the major tool for computing @xmath29 is to use a morse complex of @xmath19 obtained via discrete morse theory . in  [ s : two ] , we first give an example that illustrates how to use the morse complex to compute @xmath29 .",
    "then we choose a nice maximal tree of @xmath1 and its planar embedding , the second boundary map of the morse complex induced from these choices becomes so manageable that a description of the second boundary map can be given .",
    "in  [ s : three ] , the matrix for the second boundary map is systematically simplified ( see theorem  [ thm : matrix ] ) via row operations after giving certain orders on generating 1-cells and 2-cells ( called critical cells ) of the morse complex",
    ". then we decompose @xmath1 into biconnected graphs and further decompose each biconnected graph into triconnected graphs and compute the contribution from critical 1-cells that disappear under these decompositions .",
    "then we show all critical 1-cells except those coming from deleted edges are homologous up to signs for a given triconnected graph and generate a summand @xmath37 or @xmath38 depending on whether the graph is planar or not .",
    "finally we collect results from all decompositions to have a formula for @xmath29 . for @xmath30 , the second boundary map of the morse complex of @xmath18",
    "is not any harder than the morse complex of @xmath19 .",
    "thus the formula for @xmath35 is obtained by a similar argument .    in  [",
    "s : four ] , we develop noncommutative versions of some of technique in the previous section to obtain optimized presentations of ( pure ) graph braid groups so that they have certain desired properties via tietze transformation . in fact , the orders on critical 1-cells and 2-cells play crucial roles in systematic eliminations of canceling pairs of a 2-cell and an 1-cell . and",
    "we show that ( pure ) graph braid groups have presentations with special characteristics mentioned above .",
    "we finish the paper with the conjecture about a graph @xmath1 such that @xmath21 and @xmath39 are simple - commutator - related groups .",
    "given a finite graph @xmath1 , the unordered discrete configuration space @xmath19 is collapsed to a complex called a _",
    "morse complex _ by using discrete morse theory developed by forman @xcite . in  [ ss21:bn ] , we briefly review this technology following @xcite and use it to compute @xmath40 as a warm - up that demonstrates what is ahead of us . in  [ ss22:pbn ] , we extend the technique to the discrete configuration space @xmath18 and compute @xmath41 as an example . in  [ ss23:images ] , we show how to choose a nice maximal tree and its embedding so that the second boundary map of the induced morse complex can be described in the fewest possible cases .",
    "then we list up all of these cases in a few lemmas .",
    "let @xmath1 be a suitably subdivided graph .",
    "in order to collapse the unordered discrete configuration space @xmath19 via discrete morse theory , we first choose a maximal tree @xmath28 of @xmath1 .",
    "edges in @xmath42 are called _ deleted edges_. pick a vertex of valency 1 in @xmath28 as a basepoint and assign 0 to this vertex .",
    "we assume that the path between the base vertex 0 and the nearest vertex of valency @xmath43 in @xmath28 contains at least @xmath16 edges for the purpose that will be revealed later .",
    "next we give an order on vertices as follows : fix an embedding of @xmath28 on the plane .",
    "let @xmath44 be a regular neighborhood of @xmath28 .",
    "starting from the base vertex 0 , we number unnumbered vertices of @xmath28 as we travel along @xmath45 clockwise .",
    "figure  [ fig : k33n2 ] illustrates this procedure for the complete bipartite graph @xmath46 and for @xmath30 .",
    "there are four deleted edges to form a maximal tree .",
    "all vertices in @xmath1 are numbered and so are referred by the nonnegative integers .        each edge @xmath47 in @xmath1 is oriented so that the initial vertex @xmath48 is larger than the terminal vertex @xmath49 .",
    "the edge @xmath47 is denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "a ( open , cubical ) cell @xmath51 in the unordered discrete configuration space @xmath19 can be written as an unordered @xmath0-tuple @xmath52 where each @xmath53 is either a vertex or an edge in @xmath1 .",
    "the cell @xmath51 is an @xmath54-cell if the number of edges among @xmath53 s is @xmath54 .",
    "for example , @xmath55 represents a 2-cell in @xmath56 under the order on vertices of @xmath46 given by figure  [ fig : k33n2 ] .",
    "in fact , @xmath57 has fifteen 0-cells , thirty - six 1-cells and eighteen 2-cells as given on the left in figure  [ fig : ud2 ] .",
    "a vertex @xmath58 in an @xmath54-cell @xmath51 is said to be _ blocked _ if for the edge @xmath47 in @xmath28 such that @xmath59 , @xmath49 is in @xmath51 or is an end vertex of another edge in @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath60 denote the set of all @xmath54-cells of @xmath19 and @xmath61 .",
    "define @xmath62 for @xmath63 by induction on @xmath54 .",

    "let @xmath70 .",

    "for example , each arrow on the right of figure  [ fig : ud2 ] points from @xmath51 to @xmath76 in @xmath57 and the dashed lines represent 1-cells sent to void under @xmath73 .     and",
    "the map @xmath73,height=415 ]    for each pair @xmath77 , we homotopically collapse the closure @xmath78 onto @xmath79 to obtain a morse complex @xmath80 of @xmath19",
    ". then cells @xmath51 and @xmath76 are said to be _ redundant _ and _ collapsible _ , respectively .",
    "redundant or collapsible cells disappear in a morse complex .",
    "cells in @xmath81 survive in a morse complex and are said to be _",
    "critical_. for example , the 0-cell @xmath82 is redundant and the 1-cell @xmath83 is collapsible in figure  [ fig : ud2 ] .",
    "in fact , there are one critical 0-cell @xmath84 , seven critical 1-cells and three critical 2-cells in the morse complex @xmath85 as shown in figure  [ fig : mud2 ] .     of @xmath57,height=151 ]",
    "farley and sabalka in  @xcite gave an alternative description for these three kinds of cells in @xmath19 as follows : an edge @xmath47 in a cell @xmath86 is _ order - respecting _ if @xmath47 is not a deleted edge and there is no vertex @xmath58 in @xmath51 such that @xmath58 is adjacent to @xmath49 in @xmath28 and @xmath87 .",
    "a cell is critical if it contains neither order - respecting edges nor unblocked vertices .",
    "a cell is collapsible if it contains at least one order - respecting edge and each unblocked vertex is larger than the initial vertex of some order - respecting edge .",
    "a cell is redundant if it contains at least one unblocked vertex that is smaller than the initial vertices of all order - respecting edges .",
    "notice that there is exactly one critical 0-cell @xmath88 by the assumption that there are at least @xmath16 edges between @xmath89 and the nearest vertex with valency @xmath90 in the maximal tree .    a choice of a maximal tree of @xmath1 and its planar embedding determine an order on vertices and in turn a morse complex @xmath80 that is homotopy equivalent to @xmath19 .",
    "we wish to compute its homology groups via the cellular structure of @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath91 be the ( cubical ) cellular chain complex of @xmath19 .",
    "for an @xmath54-cell @xmath92 of @xmath19 such that @xmath93 are edges with @xmath94 and @xmath95 are vertices of @xmath1 , let @xmath96 @xmath97 then we define the boundary map as @xmath98 notice that this definition of @xmath99 on @xmath19 is different from that in @xcite and @xcite in sign convention .",
    "this convention seems more convenient in the current work .",
    "let @xmath100 be the free abelian group generated by critical @xmath54-cells .",
    "we now try to turn the graded abelian group @xmath101 into a chain complex .",
    "let @xmath102 be a homomorphism defined by @xmath103 if @xmath51 is a collapsible @xmath54-cell , by @xmath104 if @xmath51 is critical , and by @xmath105 if @xmath51 is redundant where the sign is chosen so that the coefficient of @xmath51 in @xmath106 is @xmath107 .",
    "by @xcite , there is a nonnegative integer @xmath108 such that @xmath109 and let @xmath110 .",
    "then @xmath111 is in @xmath100 and we have a homomorphism @xmath112 .",
    "define a map @xmath113 by @xmath114 .",
    "then @xmath115 forms a chain complex .",
    "however , the inclusion @xmath116 is not a chain map . instead ,",
    "consider a homomorphism @xmath117 defined as follows : for a ( critical ) @xmath54-cell @xmath51 , @xmath118 is obtained from @xmath51 by minimally adding collapsible @xmath54-cells until it becomes closed in the sense that for each redundant @xmath119-cell @xmath120 in the boundary of every @xmath54-cell summand in @xmath118 , @xmath121 already appears in @xmath118 .",
    "then @xmath122 is a chain map that is a chain homotopy inverse of @xmath123 .",
    "thus @xmath115 and @xmath91 have the same chain homotopy type .",

    "however we want to compute it directly from the chain complex @xmath126 to demonstrate discrete morse theory .",
    "in fact , @xmath127 for any braid index @xmath0 ( see lemma  [ lem : biconnected ] ) and the existence of a 2-torsion will be needed later .",
    "the morse complex @xmath124 has seven critical 1-cells @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and three critical 2-cells @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "we compute the boundary images of critical 2-cells .",
    "first , @xmath137 since @xmath131 and @xmath128 are critical 1-cells , we only consider other two 1-cells .",
    "@xmath138 in the above computation , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 are collapsible .",
    "the following computation make us feel the need of utilities such as lemma  [ lem : naturalmove ] .",
    "@xmath143 so @xmath144 .",
    "this result can be expressed by a row vector of coefficients .",
    "the boundary images of the other two critical 2-cells give two more rows .",
    "thus the second boundary map can be expressed by the following @xmath145-matrix and it can be put into an echelon form via row operations . @xmath146[l]{-1}&1&1&-1&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&\\framebox[0.4cm][l]{1}&-1&1&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&\\framebox[0.4cm][l]{2}&0 \\end{array } \\right)}\\ ] ]    since there is only one critical 0-cell , the first boundary map is zero .",
    "so the cokernel of the second boundary map is isomorphic to @xmath147 .",

    "the torsion part of @xmath147 generated by critical 1-cells corresponding to a column contains a pivot that is not @xmath148 .",
    "thus @xmath125 .",

    "<S> we discover more characteristics of graph braid groups : the @xmath0-braid group over a planar graph and the pure 2-braid group over any graph have a presentation whose relators are words of commutators , and the 2-braid group and the pure 2-braid group over a planar graph have a presentation whose relators are commutators . </S>",
    "<S> the latter was a conjecture in @xcite and so we propose a similar conjecture for higher braid indices . </S>"
