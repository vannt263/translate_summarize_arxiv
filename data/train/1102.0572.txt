    "the observation of feshbach resonances in ultracold atomic gases @xcite has opened a wealth of exciting experiments , as their presence allows tunability of the two - body interaction strength and coherent association of ultracold molecules .",
    "feshbach resonances are caused by the coupling between an atom pair and a molecular state in a closed channel potential @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used ones are magnetically induced resonances that originate from a difference in the magnetic moment of the molecular state and the atomic threshold @xcite .",
    "the location of the resonances is very sensitive to the interaction potentials .",
    "much effort has gone into constructing accurate two - body potentials in order to predict feshbach resonances and scattering properties .",
    "conversely , precise determination of feshbach resonances can be regarded as a sensitive spectroscopic tool to map out the molecular spectrum of the least bound states .    for na only three feshbach resonances",
    "have been reported so far , namely two for an ensemble prepared in the absolute hyperfine ground state @xmath3 @xcite and one in the hyperfine substate @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "all three are @xmath0-wave resonances , i.e.  caused by molecular states with rotational quantum number @xmath5 . in parallel , raman spectroscopy on a molecular beam of sodium dimers to locate the least - bound rovibrational states of the ground state potentials  and  has been performed @xcite . scattering lengths @xcite as well as feshbach resonance positions @xcite were extracted .",
    "in addition , refs .",
    "@xcite presented an extensive study of the lowest triplet potential  by two - color photoassociation spectroscopy on magneto - optically trapped na atoms .",
    "however , more precise feshbach spectroscopy of na is needed to improve the knowledge of the interaction properties .    here",
    ", we report on the observation of seven @xmath1-wave and three @xmath2-wave feshbach resonances ( i.e.  caused by molecular states with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) in the magnetic field range between 49mt and 91mt , and a more precise determination of two @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance positions first observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition , we have observed an @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance at 205.4mt and 159.0mt , respectively . using coupled - channels calculations",
    "we have improved the na@xmath8 ground - states potentials by combining our new feshbach resonance data with the known spectroscopy data .",
    "we have also applied the recently developed asymptotic - bound - state model ( abm ) @xcite for the relevant @xmath5 , 2 and 4 molecular states of na@xmath8 , providing a simple description of the data .",
    "note that @xmath2-wave feshbach resonances have so far only been observed for cs @xcite , for which even molecular states with @xmath9 have been populated @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[exp ] we outline our experimental procedure for the preparation of a na bose - einstein condensate ( sec.[prep ] ) and the feshbach spectroscopy measurements ( sec.[fs ] ) . in sec.[theory ] the theoretical model for the near threshold molecular levels of na@xmath8 is presented , introducing the interaction hamiltonian ( sec.[intro hamiltonian ] ) , followed by a short description of the abm and its application to the feshbach resonance data ( sec.[abm ] ) .",
    "we present results of the coupled - channel calculation deriving improved ground - state potentials of na@xmath8 ( sec.[cc ] ) .",
    "we summarize , give the scattering lengths obtained from the new potentials , and conclude in sec.[concl ] .",
    "the observation of magnetically induced feshbach resonances requires the preparation of a sufficiently high density and sufficiently cold atomic sample , on which an external homogeneous magnetic field can be applied .",
    "we use a na bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in an optical dipole trap ( odt ) .",
    "our experimental procedure is based on evaporative cooling of na in the @xmath10 state in a cylindrical symmetric cloverleaf ioffe - pritchard magnetic trap @xcite .",
    "we load about @xmath11 atoms from a dark - spot magneto - optical trap into the magnetic trap , and then spin - polarize at a bias offset field of 2.0mt into the @xmath10 state , in analogy to the strategy of ref.@xcite .",
    "residual atoms in @xmath12 are removed state - selectively by microwave radiation , using an offset field of 5.3mt .",
    "then , we apply forced evaporative cooling driving the @xmath10 to @xmath13 transition for about 30s .",
    "we first use a compressed magnetic trap with axial and radial trap frequencies @xmath14hz , while during the last few seconds of the evaporation stage we expand the magnetic trap to trap frequencies @xmath15hz in order to reduce losses from three - body recombination .",
    "after evaporation , we are left with @xmath16 atoms at a temperature of 2@xmath17k .    at this point",
    "we load the atoms into an odt , formed by two crossed laser beams with waists of 60@xmath17 m each and powers of 1w and 0.5w , respectively , and derived from a 1064 nm nd : yag laser .",
    "the resulting trap has a depth of about 8@xmath17k and frequencies @xmath18hz . by our loading procedure and subsequent rethermalization by elastic collisions ,",
    "we routinely obtain a bec of @xmath19 atoms in @xmath10 .",
    "subsequently , we transfer all atoms to the state @xmath13 by rapid adiabatic passage , applying a 50ms magnetic field sweep of 24@xmath17 t around an offset field of 0.1mt at a fixed microwave frequency .",
    "the typical lifetime of the @xmath13 bec with peak density of @xmath20@xmath21 in the odt is about 5s , limited by three - body recombination .",
    "a common way to probe feshbach resonances is to measure the rate of atom loss as a function of magnetic field @xmath22 .",
    "the dynamics in a bose gas is controlled by collisions that are characterized by the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath23 . near a feshbach resonance @xmath23",
    "can be described as @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the background scattering length , @xmath26 the resonance field and @xmath27 the magnetic width of the resonance .",
    "the presence of a feshbach resonance leads to a strong enhancement of loss because the dominant loss process , namely three - body recombination , scales strongly with @xmath23 @xcite .    to locate a resonance , we ramp to a magnetic field @xmath22 , wait for a certain hold time , after which we ramp the field back to zero and use absorption imaging to measure the remaining number of atoms",
    "the ramp times are always short compared to the hold times .",
    "a compilation of our measurements is shown in fig.[frall ] and the experimental results are summarized in table[frlist ] .",
    "we have observed 12 loss resonances between 49mt and 91mt , which we assign as seven @xmath1-wave and three @xmath2-wave resonances .",
    "the @xmath0-wave resonances at 85.1mt and 90.5mt have been measured with higher accuracy than reported previously @xcite .",
    "guided by initial theoretical models we performed a restricted search at higher magnetic fields and located two additional feshbach resonances , namely one @xmath1-wave resonance at 159.0mt and one @xmath0-wave resonance at 205.4mt .    the required hold times range from 25ms for the broadest @xmath0-wave resonances up to 4s for the very narrow @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave resonances . except for the @xmath0-wave resonances ,",
    "the typical width of the loss features is about 10@xmath17 t to 20@xmath17 t , mostly determined by our magnetic field stability .",
    "we take the magnetic field value of maximal loss as the resonance position @xmath28 .",
    "the magnetic field is calibrated close to each feshbach resonance by means of rf spectroscopy on the @xmath29 transition of na . the asymmetry observed in the @xmath0-wave loss features in fig.[frall](k ) and [ frall](_l",
    "_ ) is caused by molecule association when ramping down the magnetic field for imaging .",
    ".overview of the experimentally and theoretically obtained results on feshbach resonances in na prepared in the lowest hyperfine substate @xmath3 .",
    "experimentally the position of maximum loss @xmath28 is given , which is determined by gaussian fits to the loss features .",
    "the errors reflect the one standard deviation statistical uncertainty in the magnetic field calibration , determined by the fwhm of the rf calibration spectra and from the profile fit .",
    "the middle columns shows the results for the moerdijk and abm models in terms of @xmath30 ( see sec.[abm ] ) .",
    "the last two columns show the feshbach resonance position @xmath26 and width @xmath27 from coupled - channels ( cc ) calculation , based on refined na@xmath8 ground - state potentials ( see sec.[cc ] ) .",
    "the brackets in the last column give the exponent to the power ten .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath31 characterize the bound state and are discussed in the text .",
    "note that for the @xmath32=4 states the @xmath33 quantum numbers could not be assigned ( see sec.[cc ] ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ultracold collisions can be modeled with good reliability using the new potentials and the molecular hyperfine and second - order spin - orbit coupling . for @xmath34 the scattering length for the lowest open channel @xmath35",
    "is calculated to be @xmath36 ( @xmath37 m ) , which is in a good agreement with @xmath38 , derived by crubellier _",
    "@xcite , but less well to the value @xmath39 obtained by samuelis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite from a spectroscopic study of collision resonances in a molecular beam .",
    "earlier reported values ( see e.g.  refs.@xcite ) are less precise but agree with the new value within their reported error limits . the small uncertainty for the scattering length results from the improved precision in the feshbach resonance locations compared to refs.@xcite .",
    "note that this scattering length is equal to that of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 channels .",
    "the other scattering lengths relevant for ultracold na prepared in the @xmath42 manifold are @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the @xmath45 and @xmath46 channels , respectively @xcite .",
    "we can provide a very reliable value for the scattering length of the triplet  state , namely @xmath47 .",
    "it agrees with the value found in ref.@xcite , but has a 1@xmath48 deviation with the value reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "this is not surprising given the strong correlation between this scattering lengths and the one for @xmath35 .",
    "the scattering length of the singlet  state is mainly determined by the binding energies of the two last bound states @xmath49 and 65 @xcite .",
    "thus we could not improve the precision of the singlet scattering length , but its value has changed slightly to @xmath50 .",
    "this fact is understandable , because the scattering lengths of the singlet and triplet states are correlated by noting that the @xmath51 bound level is significantly mixed with the @xmath52 one .    finally , we propose that the singlet scattering length can be improved by looking for a narrow @xmath53-wave resonance in collisions between na atoms in the @xmath13 and @xmath54 state .",
    "we predict a @xmath53-wave resonance at a magnetic field of 23.5mt .",
    "it is desirable to improve the molecular beam data from about 30mhz to better than 1mhz , which now seems feasible given femtosecond comb - based optical frequency measurements .",
    "we acknowledge the workshop , in particular morris weier , for the construction of our cloverleaf magnetic trap , wolfgang ketterle and christian sanner for the loan of an 1.7ghz aom , and jian peng ang and rico pires for sharing their abm code . we acknowledge support from the heidelberg center of quantum dynamics .",
