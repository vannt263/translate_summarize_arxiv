    "optimal control theory is concerned with the analysis of controlled dynamical systems , where one aims at steering such a system from a given configuration to some desired target by minimizing some criterion . the pontryagin maximum principle ( in short , pmp ) , established at the end of the 50 s for general finite - dimensional nonlinear continuous - time dynamics",
    "( see @xcite , and see @xcite for the history of this discovery ) , is certainly the milestone of the classical optimal control theory .",
    "it provides a first - order necessary condition for optimality , by asserting that any optimal trajectory must be the projection of an extremal .",
    "the pmp then reduces the search of optimal trajectories to a boundary value problem posed on extremals . optimal control theory , and in particular the pmp ,",
    "has an immense field of applications in various domains , and it is not our aim here to list them .",
    "we speak of a _ purely continuous - time optimal control problem _ , when both the state @xmath1 and the control @xmath2 evolve continuously in time , and the control system under consideration has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "such models assume that the control is permanent , that is , the value of @xmath6 can be chosen at each time @xmath7 .",
    "we refer the reader to textbooks on continuous optimal control theory such as @xcite for many examples of theoretical or practical applications .",
    "we speak of a _ purely discrete - time optimal control problem _ , when both the state @xmath1 and the control @xmath2 evolve in a discrete way in time , and the control system under consideration has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 . as in the continuous case ,",
    "such models assume that the control is permanent , that is , the value of @xmath11 can be chosen at each time @xmath12 . a version of the pmp for such discrete - time control systems has been established in @xcite under appropriate convexity assumptions .",
    "the considerable development of the discrete - time control theory was in particular motivated by the need of considering digital systems or discrete approximations in numerical simulations of differential control systems ( see the textbooks @xcite ) .",
    "it can be noted that some early works devoted to the discrete - time pmp ( like @xcite ) are mathematically incorrect . some counterexamples were provided in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , showing that , as is now well known , the exact analogous of the continuous - time pmp does not hold at the discrete level .",
    "more precisely , the maximization condition of the continuous - time pmp can not be expected to hold in general in the discrete - time case .",
    "nevertheless , a weaker condition can be derived , in terms of nonpositive gradient condition ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 42.1 ) ) .",
    "we speak of an _ optimal sampled - data control problem _ , when the state @xmath1 evolves continuously in time , whereas the control @xmath2 evolves in a discrete way in time .",
    "this hybrid situation is often considered in practice for problems in which the evolution of the state is very quick ( and thus can be considered continuous ) with respect to that of the control .",
    "we often speak , in that case , of _ digital control_. this refers to a situation where , due for instance to hardware limitations or to technical difficulties , the value @xmath6 of the control can be chosen only at times @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is fixed and @xmath12 .",
    "this means that , once the value @xmath15 is fixed , @xmath6 remains constant over the time interval @xmath16 .",
    "hence the trajectory",
    "@xmath1 evolves according to @xmath17 in other words , this _ sample - and - hold _ procedure consists of  freezing \" the value of @xmath2 at each _ controlling time _",
    "@xmath13 on the corresponding _ sampling time interval _ @xmath16 , where @xmath18 is called the _",
    "sampling period_. in this situation , the control of the system is clearly nonpermanent .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the classical optimal control theory does not treat general nonlinear optimal sampled - data control problems , but concerns either purely continuous - time , or purely discrete - time optimal control problems .",
    "it is one of our objectives to derive , in this paper , a pmp which can be applied to general nonlinear optimal sampled - data control problems .",
    "actually , we will be able to establish a pmp in the much more general framework of _ time scales _ , which unifies and extends continuous - time and discrete - time issues .",
