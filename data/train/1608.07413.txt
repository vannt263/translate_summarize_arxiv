    "gyrfs  @xcite made many conjectures , and some of them were claiming that excluding chordless cycles with various constraints on their length should lead to @xmath4-bounded classes .",
    "recently , much progress has been reported toward these conjectures , see for instance  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on excluding cycles with contraints on their chords .",

    "it is straightforward to check that long - unichord - free graphs form a generalisation of unichord - free graphs and of house*-free graphs .",
    "they also form a generalisation of the classical class of chordal graphs ( a graph is _ chordal _ if it contains no chordless cycle of length at least  4 ) . as classical result states that chordal",
    "graphs are perfect ( equivalently , they are @xmath4-bounded by the indentity function ) . in  @xcite",
    ", it is proved that unichord - free graphs are @xmath4-bounded by the function @xmath15 , and in  @xcite , it is proved that house*-free graphs are @xmath4-bounded by some exponential function .",
    "we generalise these theorems and we provide a better bound for the last one by showing that long - unichord - free graphs are @xmath4-bounded by a polynomial function of degree  3 ( see theorem  [ the : cluc ] ) .",
    "our proof relies on a decomposition theorem ( see theorem  [ th : maindec ] ) that is easily obtained from  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that as observed by esperet ( personal communication ) , no counter - example to the following statement is known : every @xmath4-bounded class is @xmath4-bounded by some polynomial .",
    "it must be stressed out that applying decomposition theorems to prove @xmath4-boundedness is not at all straightforward .",
    "there are several papers dealing with the following question : when a prescribed operation is applied repeatedly to some graphs from a class @xmath4-bounded by @xmath8 , is the larger class that is obtained @xmath4-bounded by a possibly different function @xmath16 ?",
    "this has been answered positively for several operations , most notably for one that we use in our decomposition theorem , the so called amalgam operation ( to be defined in the next section ) , see  @xcite .",
    "but the theorem from  @xcite is not enough for our purpose because it leads to an exponential @xmath4-bounding function . here , to obtain @xmath4-boundedness we prove a stronger property for the sake of induction , roughly we find graphs with a special structure that intersect all inclusion - wise maximal cliques of the graph to be colored , and we apply this procedure inductively on what remains ( where the maximum clique is smaller ) .",
    "our decomposition theorem turns out to be a complete structural description of long - unichord - free graphs : it tells how all long - unichord - free graphs can be constructed from simple pieces . as a byproduct of this description",
    "we obtain a polynomial time recognition algorithm for long - unichord - free graphs .",
    "this was an open question mentioned in  @xcite ( where a similar algorithm is given for unichord - free graphs ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that in  @xcite , a problem of the very same flavour is proved to be np - complete : deciding whether a graph contains a cycle @xmath17 with a unique chord @xmath18 such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are at distance at least  4 along the cycle .",
    "this shows that naive attempts to obtain our recognition algorithm are likely to fail .      in section  [ sec :",
    "opkn ] , we define all the decompositions and operations on graphs that we need , and we survey several results about how they preserve perfection and @xmath4-boundedness .    in section  [ sec : subst ]",
    ", we study a technic to prove that an operation on graphs ( namely , the substitution operation , everything is defined in the next section ) preserves @xmath4-boundedness .",
    "this technic is analogous to the one used in the proof of the replication lemma of lovsz ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it consists in identifying the existence of a particular subgraph that intersects all maximal cliques of a graph , and in showing that this existence is preserved by the operation .",
    "our technic yields short proofs of known results and may provide good bounds in some situations . for intance",
    "we prove that the closure of 3-colourable graphs under substitution is @xmath4-bounded by a quadratic function , a seemingly new result .",
    "note that the results from section  [ sec : subst ] are not used in the rest of the article .",
    "they illustrate our method and are of independent interest .    in section  [ sec : amalgam ]",
    ", we apply a similar technic to a larger set of operations ( namely , we consider 1-joins , amalgams and proper 2-cutsets ) .",
    "the price to pay for that is that the classes of graphs where the technic can be applied are even more restricted .",
    "but fortunately , it does not vanish to nothing as shown afterward .    in section  [ sec : struc ] ,",

    "based on lemma  [ typeh ] , and the property that these two holes share only one edges , there are @xmath454 possible types for @xmath17 : @xmath455 , @xmath456 , @xmath457 , @xmath458 , @xmath459 , @xmath460 , @xmath461 , @xmath462 , @xmath463 , @xmath464 , @xmath465 , @xmath466 , @xmath467 .",
    "if @xmath17 belongs to type @xmath467 then any vertex of @xmath59 ( this vertex is exist since @xmath313 ) with hole type @xmath468 induces a cycle with a long unichord in in @xmath39 , a contradiction .",
    "if @xmath17 belongs to the remaining types , either @xmath39 or @xmath40 contains @xmath17 , contradiction .",
    "hence , we may assume that the unique chord divides @xmath17 into a hole and a triangle ( @xmath17 is a cap ) .",
    "this also means that @xmath17 consists of a hole @xmath10 plus a vertex @xmath21 that is adjacent to two adjacent vertices of this hole . if @xmath10 type @xmath469 , @xmath21 does not exits .",
    "if @xmath10 is type @xmath470 , every choice of @xmath21 makes @xmath17 belong to @xmath39 and @xmath40 . if @xmath10 is type @xmath468 ( or @xmath471 ) , this hole with a vertex of @xmath59 ( or @xmath58 ) induced a cycle with a long - unichord in @xmath39 , a contradiction .",
    "we now describe our algorithm ( similar to the algorithm to recognize cap - free graph from  @xcite ) .",
    "a graph is _ basic _ if it is chordal or unichord - free .",
    "a _ decomposition tree _",
    "@xmath472 of a graph @xmath1 is defined as follows :    * the root of @xmath472 is @xmath1 .",
    "* if some node @xmath10 of @xmath472 is not basic and has a universal vertex , then its unique child is @xmath473 where @xmath45 is the set of all universal vertices of @xmath10 . *",
    "if some node of @xmath472 is not basic , has no universal vertex and has a decomposition , then its children are its blocks of decomposition . *",
    "all nodes not handled in the previous cases are leaves of @xmath472 ( to be more specific : basic nodes and nodes that are not basic , without universal vertices and decomposition ) .",
    "note that the definition is not fully deterministic since different decompositions can be present in a graph . in this case ,",
    "one of the decomposition should be used ( so a graph may have different decomposition trees ) .",
    "note that every graph has a decompostion tree , and that every decomposition tree of a graph is finite ( because the children of a given node are smaller than the node ) .",
    "[ l : sum ] suppose that @xmath1 is a non - basic graph , with no universal vertex and with an amalgam or a cutvertex .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be the blocks of decompostion of @xmath1 with respect to this amalgam or cutvertex",
    ". then @xmath475 .",
    "if for @xmath61 we have @xmath476 , then every pair @xmath477 such that @xmath478 can be associated injectively to a similar pair in @xmath1 , so the inequality holds .",
    "hence , we may assume that @xmath479 .    if we have @xmath480 , then every pair @xmath477 such that @xmath481 can be associated injectively to a similar pair in @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath1 has no universal vertex , some vertex @xmath482 has a non - neighbor in @xmath1 and provides an extra non - adjacent pair in @xmath1 , so that the inequality holds .",
    "hence , we may assume that @xmath483 .",
    "so , we just have to check that @xmath484 .",
    "this is the case because @xmath1 is not basic , so it is not chordal and contains a chordless cycle of length at least  4 ( that provides at least two non - adjacent pairs ) .    the next lemma is implicitly proved in  @xcite ( as corollary 2.16 ) , but the machinery there is much heavier and relies on many definitions , so we prefer to give our own simple proof .",
    "note that in  @xcite , it is claimed without proof that any graph with an amalgam should have an amalgam such that at least one block of decomposition has no amalgam .",
    "such a result would imply the existence of a decomposition tree of linear size , but unfortunately , in  @xcite , a counter - example to the claim is provided .      if a graph @xmath10 has a universal vertex @xmath20 , then @xmath486 .",
    "hence , by lemma  [ l : sum ] the number of leaves of @xmath472 is at most @xmath487 . since removing the set of universal vertices",
