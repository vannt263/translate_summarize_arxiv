    "topological order is one of the most fascinating discoveries in physics of the last decades . owing to their highly non - local nature",
    ", topological phases can host anyonic excitations , which lie at the heart of several schemes for fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the experimental realization of abelian and non - abelian anyons with ultra - cold gases , which offer unprecedented possibilities for the coherent manipulation of quantum systems , has motivated an impressive amount of theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "in particular , most of the work has focused on the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe )  @xcite , and on topologically - ordered states stemming from the interplay of interactions and static magnetic fields ( or more general gauge fields )  @xcite . however , despite of impressive experimental progresses in engineering the latter using either rotating gases , engineered lattice shaking , or laser - assisted tunneling , the regimes of stability of such phases have been so far elusive .    in this article , we demonstrate that fundamental features of fqh states can be realized and observed in current cold - atom experiments exploiting the concept of _ synthetic dimension _",
    "@xcite , namely interpreting internal atomic states as spatial indices of a ladder structure in real space .",
    "recently , this concept led to the experimental observation of chiral edge states in both bosonic and fermionic quantum gases  @xcite .",
    "the key experimental advantage of this protocol is that the gauge field is implemented without significant spontaneous emission rates , thus guaranteeing sufficiently long coherence times to observe strongly correlated states of matter ( especially when clock transitions are employed as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as such",
    ", synthetic ladders represent ideal settings to investigate the interplay between gauge fields and interactions considered in numerous theoretical studies , both for bosons  @xcite and for fermions  @xcite .",
    "we show that the one - dimensional version of the laughlin state appears in several experimentally - relevant models of one - dimensional quantum gases with a synthetic dimension .",
    "we illustrate that unambiguous signatures of this laughlin physics can be characterized via measurements of the current , thus drawing a clear path towards the experimental detection of fqhe in atomic systems .",
    "the rationale behind this can be understood as follows ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schemekane ] ) : a genuine laughlin state in a two - dimensional system with hard - wall boundaries is characterized by a chiral edge mode with fractional conductance .",
    "influenced by the coupled - wire approach to the fqhe proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we split the two - dimensional system into a long array of one - dimensional wires pierced by a magnetic flux , and subsequently reduce the length of the array to two neighboring and coupled wires  @xcite . during this procedure",
    ", the laughlin state has been turned into a one - dimensional quantum liquid with two counter - propagating fractional modes , each of them localized at one of the two wires .",
    "this is what we call a _ laughlin - like state _ , and it is the object of our analysis .    by interpreting the quantum number labelling the wires as the spin state of an atom",
    ", we obtain a simple model for a one - dimensional quantum gas with synthetic dimension , or , briefly , the synthetic ladder mentioned above that is currently at experimental focus .",
    "a similar analysis can also be done for condensed - matter systems like rashba wires  @xcite , which are unfortunately prone to disorder and to localization of the counter - propagating modes : ultra - cold atoms are disorder - free and thus provide a more convenient platform for an experimental analysis .",
    "we provide numerical evidence of laughlin - like states using algorithms based on matrix - product states ( mps )  @xcite . with the help of analytical techniques such as bosonization  @xcite , we pinpoint some unambiguous signatures of laughlin - like physics , and characterize them with our simulations . in particular , we focus on the singular behavior of the chiral current flowing in the system when entering the laughlin - like state and on entanglement - related observables .",
    "an exactly - solvable model is presented which nicely complements the approximate analytical techniques and the numerical simulations .",
    "our work is of direct experimental relevance for laboratories where gases with a synthetic dimension are currently realized .",
    "the experimental observation of states with counter - propagating fractional modes would constitute the first unambiguous signature of effects quintessential to topological strongly - correlated systems .",
    "synthetic dimensions thus mark a new paradigm in the quantum simulation of the fqhe and this study opens the way to the discussion of topological order and anyons in systems with a longer synthetic dimension .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ laughlinstatesinbosonicmodels ] , we present our numerical results on the observation of laughlin - like states in bosonic models , whereas in sec .  [",
    "sec : laughlinstatesinfermionicmodels ] we focus on fermionic systems .",

    "we critically discuss the signatures employed to diagnose the laughlin - like physics .",

    "[ sec : iqhe ] , we review the integer quantum hall effect in a non - interacting fermionic model focusing on the analogies with the fractional case that we investigate . in sec .  [",

    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . throughout the paper",
    ", we set @xmath0 and the lattice constant @xmath1 .",
    "although laughlin states are usually studied in the two - dimensional fqhe , they may also appear in strongly anisotropic systems .",
    "following the analysis in arrays of many coupled wires  @xcite , a minimal system consisting of a ladder with the number of legs equal to two and pierced by a magnetic field is predicted to support laughlin - like states which share important properties with their original version  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this section is the numerical characterization of the fractional laughlin - like state which appears in an experimentally - relevant microscopic model for a two - leg bosonic ladder .    ) in a magnetic flux , @xmath2 .",
    "longitudinal and transverse hopping parameters are denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the currents , for the two spin components , @xmath5 , flow in opposite directions ( purple arrows).,width=302 ]         laughlin - like states are identified by the existence of two counter - propagating modes , each of them localized at one of the two legs of the ladder .",
    "their appearance is linked with a fractional filling factor , relating particle density to flux . arranging them next to each other",
    "implies that the low - energy physics is not anymore topologically protected ( in the two - dimensional fqhe they are crucially separated by a macroscopic distance ) , and thus we can not speak of genuine topological order .",
    "however , the low - energy physics is completely analogous , and in particular the edge modes carry a fractional charge and have a quantized fractional conductance .",
    "thus , by identifying the two legs with two spin states , as in a synthetic ladder , we can identify the laughlin - like states with fractional helical liquids  @xcite .",
    "we consider the limit of hard - core bosons ( hcb ) , when the on - site repulsion is so strong to forbid double occupancies in each bosonic site .",
    "the experimental realization of synthetic ladders pierced by a magnetic field for bosonic atoms has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite it is realized using a real dimension via superlattices ) .",

    "we use @xmath3 as a reference energy scale .",
    "a sketch of the two - leg ladder is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ladderscheme ] .",
    "the length of the ladder is @xmath15 and the number of bosons is @xmath16 , and we define the density @xmath17 . a crucial quantity in the study of laughlin - like physics is the filling factor @xmath18 , which relates the density of bosons to the density of magnetic fluxes and parallels the filling factor which is crucial in the study of the two - dimensional fqhe .",
    "bosonization predicts the appearance of laughlin - like states in bosonic ladders when the filling factor takes the values @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a _ even _ positive integer  @xcite ; in the following , we focus on the laughlin - like state appearing at @xmath21 , which is the most easily accessible state .",
    "we stress that bosonization predictions are obtained in the perturbative regime @xmath22 ( see appendix  [ sec : bosonizationconventions ] ) , and thus in this article we will restrict our analysis to it in order to have a theoretical guideline for our simulations . according to bosonization ,",
    "distinctive signatures of the laughlin - like regime are provided by transport measurements ( e.g.  the fractional conductance )  @xcite .",
    "however , the occurrence of the @xmath23 state can also be detected by thermodynamic observables more suitable for a cold - atom experiment , such as the anisotropy of spin susceptibilities  @xcite and the chiral current , @xmath24  @xcite ; we focus on the latter , because it is immediately accessible both in experiments and in numerical simulations .    in the two - leg ladder ,",
    "the chiral current is proportional to the difference between the currents circulating along the two legs ( see fig .  [",

    "[ sec : iqhe ] and  [ sec : signaturesbasedonthecurrent ] , in the limit @xmath30 , the chiral current is expected to display a characteristic double - cusp pattern in proximity of the resonant value @xmath31 .",

    "the flux @xmath39 identifies the beginning of the helical region .",
    "such singular scaling can be linked to the occurrence of a lifshitz commensurate - incommensurate ( c - ic ) transition  @xcite , with dynamical exponent @xmath40 , and signals the transition from a commensurate phase ( in this case , when @xmath41 and the system is in the helical region ) to an incommensurate phase ( in this case , when @xmath42 ) .",
    "similar considerations hold also for a flux value @xmath43 , which identifies the `` end '' of the helical region .",
    "furthermore , the fractional helical behavior can be distinguished from the other ordinary gapless phases by the value of the _ central charge _",
    "@xmath44 , which roughly speaking is equal to half the number of gapless modes .",
    "since in the helical case there are only two counter - propagating gapless modes , @xmath44 is equal to @xmath45 , and @xmath44 is equal to @xmath46 in the ordinary gapless liquid because there are four gapless modes .",
    "the value of the central charge @xmath44 of the system can be easily extracted from the entanglement entropy ( ee ) , @xmath47 , which we here briefly recall .",

    "[ fig : numericalsimulationsbosons]*a * ) .",
    "the narrowness of such region is due to the small value of @xmath74 which is motivated by the necessity of comparing with bosonization ; the finite value of @xmath15 is responsible for the limited number of numerical points inside it ( in this case they are at most two ) . on the other hand",

    "[ fig : currentcentralchargeandentanglemententropybosons]*c * ) can be due to finite - size and boundary effects , as well as to numerical errors during the variational minimization .",
    "in particular , we impute this disagreement to the finite values of the maximum bond link , @xmath89 , that we use to describe the mps state at the end of the variational procedure .",
    "because of the large amount of entanglement , to correctly describe the mps state during and at the end of the variational procedure , we see that we would need @xmath90 , which can not be achieved with our computational resources .    with @xmath89",

    "we also notice that the current pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig : currentcentralchargeandentanglemententropybosons]*a * ) does not vanish at @xmath93 , and does not obey the square - root scaling for @xmath94 .",
    "both these features , can be attributed to the presence of an additional background signal which influences that of the @xmath23 laughlin - like state . a deeper characterization of the nature of this signal is beyond the aim of this manuscript .",

    "for sufficiently small @xmath4 , one can approximate the @xmath343 mode to be polarized @xmath138 and the @xmath344 one to be polarized @xmath345 . thus , @xmath346 and @xmath347 in the limit @xmath335 , to the first order in @xmath348 , the second term in eq .",

    "a singular behavior arises from the divergence in @xmath363 , which leads to @xmath364 , for some coefficients @xmath365 and @xmath194 .    in the helical region , slightly above the @xmath366 transition , only helical edge modes are found , with linear dispersion relation .",

    "<S> the combination of interactions and static gauge fields plays a pivotal role in our understanding of strongly - correlated quantum matter . </S>",
    "<S> cold atomic gases endowed with a synthetic dimension are emerging as an ideal platform to experimentally address this interplay in quasi - one - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental question is whether these setups can give access to pristine two - dimensional phenomena , such as the fractional quantum hall effect , and how . </S>",
    "<S> we show that unambiguous signatures of bosonic and fermionic laughlin - like states can be observed and characterized in synthetic ladders . </S>",
    "<S> we theoretically diagnose these laughlin - like states focusing on the chiral current flowing in the ladder , on the central charge of the low - energy theory , and on the properties of the entanglement entropy . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , laughlin - like states are separated from conventional liquids by lifschitz - type transitions , characterized by sharp discontinuities in the current profiles , which we address using extensive simulations based on matrix - product states . our work provides a qualitative and quantitative guideline towards the observability and understanding of strongly - correlated states of matter in synthetic ladders . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we unveil how state - of - the - art experimental settings constitute an ideal starting point to progressively tackle two - dimensional strongly interacting systems from a ladder viewpoint , opening a new perspective for the observation of non - abelian states of matter . </S>"
