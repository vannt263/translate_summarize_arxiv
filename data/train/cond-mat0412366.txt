    "as known , many key features of continuous - time chaotic dynamics can be treated in terms of two - dimensional or even one - dimensional discrete - time maps ( see e.g. @xcite ) . among them , most simple and perfect ones are the famous bernoulli map , @xmath0 @xmath1mod@xmath2 , and the tent map , @xmath0 @xmath3 , both defined at the interval @xmath4 . almost any trajectory of both maps is chaotic , that is dense in all this interval .    in computer , however , any trajectory finishes at zero after @xmath5 steps only , where @xmath6 is number of bits under use .",
    "this contraction of the discretized phase space , from total @xmath7 points to single point @xmath8 , happens because the maps are non - invertible , i.e. relation between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is not an one - to - one correspondence . but a suitable slight distortion can make a discretized map invertible . evidently , any such map is nothing but a permutation of @xmath7 states ( @xmath11 @xmath12/n$ ] ) .",
    "in particular , the invertible discrete versions of the bernoulli map describe the mersenne digital auto - generators of pseudo - random 0 - 1-sequences ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for example",
    ", the mersenne map in fig.1 represents transitions between 16 states of a particular `` toy '' 4-bit mersenne generator ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the general formula of such maps is @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and any of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , equals to either zero or unit , @xmath19 ( hence this is class of @xmath20 different maps ) . to see corresponding unitary evolution matrix",
    ", it is necessary to turn the map picture headfirst and insert zeros and ones in place of the empty cells and crosses , respectively .",
    "the map in fig.1 has two immovable points ( @xmath8 and @xmath21 ) and two cycles ( periodic orbits ) with equal lengths @xmath22 . in applications of much greater mersenne maps",
    "( with @xmath23 @xcite ) , the main issue is construction of those having most long cycles , with @xmath24 .",
    "here , we will be interested in modest problem about statistics of cycles of discrete maps , to be concrete , definite class of discrete tent maps .",
    "example of the discrete bernoulli map ( the mersenne map , see body text ) . ]",
    "first consider the variety of generally asymmetric continuous tent maps ( ctm ) described by @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the inversion of ( [ ctm ] ) reads as @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 representing two variants of the inversion .",
    "let us write , with the help of ( [ ictm ] ) , @xmath30 as a function of @xmath31 and then equate @xmath30 to @xmath31 at various possible values @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath34 linear equations which determine @xmath34 points belonging to all possible periodic orbits ( cycles ) of length @xmath35 . that are either irreducible ( indivisible ) orbits or , if @xmath35 has a divider @xmath36 , composite orbits consisting of @xmath37 repetitions of an irreducible orbit with length @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is number of different irreducible periodic orbits with length @xmath36 , and the sum is taken over all the dividers of @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath35 is a prime number then ( [ expan ] ) yields @xmath40 since @xmath41 ( there are two immovable points ) .",
    "in general , it is not hard to derive from ( [ expan ] ) that @xmath42}-[l/2]\\right)\\leq ln_l\\leq 2^l-2\\,\\,\\label{any}\\ ] ] here @xmath43 $ ] @xmath44 if @xmath45 is even , and @xmath43 $ ] @xmath46 if @xmath45 is odd . at any @xmath47 , according to ( [ any ] ) , @xmath48 at relatively small @xmath45 , from ( [ expan ] ) one finds : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , ...",
    "next , consider invertible discrete tent maps ( dtm ) representing discrete analogues of the continuous tent maps ( [ ctm ] ) . to be concrete ,",
    "let us introduce the class of discrete maps defined by @xmath59 & , & \\,x < a\\,\\,;\\\\    y=\\left\\{\\frac { n(n - x)}{n - a}\\right\\}-1 & , & \\,x\\geq a\\,\\ , \\end{array }    \\label{dtm}\\ ] ] here , like in ( [ dbm ] ) , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are integers , @xmath62 @xmath63 ; @xmath64 is analogue of @xmath65 in ( [ ctm ] ) , @xmath66 ; @xmath67\\,$ ] is an integer closest to @xmath68 from below ( with @xmath67 $ ] @xmath69 if @xmath70 is integer ) , and @xmath71 means closest integer greater than ( or equal to ) @xmath68 ( that is @xmath72 @xmath69 if @xmath70 is integer ) .",
    "two examples of maps defined by formula ( [ dtm ] ) , at @xmath73 , are shown in fig.2 .",
    "let us prove that ( [ dtm ] ) prescribers invertible maps , i.e. establishes an one - to - one correspondence between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "it is sufficient to prove that the upper r.h.s . and lower r.h.s .",
    "in ( [ dtm ] ) can not produce one and the same number .",
    "indeed , in such a case we would have @xmath76=y=\\left\\ { n(n - x^{\\prime\\prime})/(n - a)\\right\\}-1\\,\\,,\\ ] ] with some @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this would mean that @xmath79 ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 are some integers ) , therefore , @xmath82 but , obviously , the latter inequality contradicts the preceding equality .",
    "the proof is finished .",
    "it is easy to see also , that absolute value of a deviation of any dtm ( [ dtm ] ) from its ctm prototype ( [ ctm ] ) , with @xmath83 , ( as well as deviation of ( [ dbm ] ) from bernoulli map ) does not exceed @xmath84 lowest bit only ( @xmath85 , in terms of @xmath86 ) . in this sense , any dtm tends to corresponding ctm , when @xmath87 .",
    "however , the inverted map remains strongly discontinuous , which is a payment for its unambiguity .",
    "hence , in essence , the limit of dtm at @xmath87 does not coincide with corresponding ctm .",
    "naturally , there is no simple rule for the cycles ( periodic orbits ) of the dtms .",
    "a number of various irreducible cycles and lengths of these cycles are extremely irregular functions of @xmath64 and @xmath88 . in",
    "contrary to ( [ expan ] ) , now @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a number of different irreducible periodic orbits with length @xmath35 ( possibly , @xmath91 ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath92 and some three next values of @xmath93 this expansion looks as @xmath94 where the second multiplier ( if any ) in each term is number of different cycles of a length represented by the first multiplier .",
    "in other example , for @xmath95 , @xmath96    typically , a dtm have a long cycle whose length is comparable with the total number of points , @xmath88 , i.e. maximal possible length .",
    "this is illustrated by fig.3 relating to @xmath97 .",
    "quite similar pictures take place also at greater @xmath98 .",
    "we see that practically any dtm has a cycle with length @xmath99 .",
    "such long cycles , whose length @xmath45 is comparable with @xmath88 , can be treated as discrete analogues of the chaotic trajectories of ctm .",
    "the left plot in fig.3 demonstrates highly irregular dependence of the maximal cycle length , @xmath100 , on the asymmetry parameter @xmath93 . at the same time",
    ", the right - hand plot there shows that even slight smoothing of the data produces rather regular results .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to describe the cycles of dtms in statistical language , considering some specific subclasses of dtms instead of individual maps .",
    "let us consider the family of nearly ( asymptotically ) symmetric dtms determined by the conditions @xmath101 since @xmath102 , we obtain the growing statistical ensemble , which is all the more representative one because all the maps defined by ( [ sym ] ) do tend to the same limit @xmath103 @xmath104",
    ".        it would be interesting to investigate such the family of asymptotically symmetric discrete tent maps ( asdtm ) , in comparison with the usual symmetric ctm . here",
    ", simplest statistical characteristics of cycles ( periodic orbits ) of the asdtm will be under our attention .",
    "let @xmath105 designates a density of probability distribution of the cycle lengths in this family of maps .",
    "in other words , practically , @xmath106 where @xmath90 is now * _ summary _ *   number of periodic orbits of length @xmath45 in all the maps of the asdtm family .",
    "it is useful to introduce also the quantity @xmath107 that is relative ( probability ) measure of points which belong to all periodic orbits with lengths @xmath108 at all the maps .    in reality , with the help of an ordinal pc only , it would take rather long time to obtain all the periodic orbits if @xmath109 .",
    "but our computations , performed at @xmath110 , showed that already @xmath111 are satisfactory values , because next @xmath98 s increases do not change the picture qualitatively ( although , of course , providing better numeric accuracy ) .    therefore , it is reasonable to prefer calculations at not high @xmath98 ( @xmath112 ) but apply slight smoothing over @xmath45 s values .",
    "concretely , the plot @xmath113 in fig.3 represents the result of averaging of the exact @xmath113 ( defined by ( [ w ] ) ) over the intervals @xmath114\\,$ ] , with @xmath115 .    such smoothed probability density , @xmath113 ,",
    "is represented by the curved line at right - hand side of fig.3 .",
    "it is easy to find that the best fitting for it is nothing but the inverse proportional law : @xmath116 where factor @xmath117 ensures the normalization , @xmath118 the dependence ( [ ip ] ) is shown by the straight line , and by smooth curve in the inset which demonstrates good quality of this fitting for short cycles too .",
    "the curved line at left side of fig.3 shows an example of the probability ( [ p ] ) .",
    "it is not smoothed , therefore , formed by many steps with very different heights ( like the famous devil s staircase ) .",
    "its closeness to the thinner straight line , which corresponds to @xmath119 , says that the total @xmath120 points are distributed approximately equally between cycles with different lengths .",
    "this is just about what the approximation ( [ ip ] ) says .",
    "if combining ( [ w]),([p]),([ip ] ) and the approximation @xmath119 , we obtain the estimate of mean number of cycles per one map of the family : @xmath121 ( let us recollect that @xmath90 is * _ summary _ * value for all the asdtm ) . at the same time , as the above examples of map expansions into cycles do show , fluctuations in number of cycles from one particular map to another are significantly greater than the mean value ( [ mnc ] ) . according to these examples , as well to the @xmath105 plots , especial contribution to the fluctuations comes from cycles whose lengths are powers of two",
    ".    nevertheless , when rising @xmath98 from 12 to 16 a definite decrease of the fluctuations was noticed .",
    "this observation pushes us to the hypothesis that formula ( [ ip ] ) represents a true asymptotics of the cycles length distribution ( [ w ] ) in the limit ( [ sym ] ) .",
    "there is a simple naive explanation of the hypothetical asymptotics ( [ ip ] ) . in above derivation of the estimate ( [ asympt ] ) for the cycles numbers of continuous tent maps ( ctm ) ,",
    "the factor @xmath34 ( with @xmath45 being cycle lengths ) arises from the two - valued property of their inverse maps ( i.e. due to their irreversibility ) .",
    "since the discrete tent maps ( dtm ) under consideration have univalent inversions , in their case this factor must disappear .",
    "thus one deduces the inverse proportional dependence of number of the cycles ( periodic orbits ) on their lengths , i.e. comes to ( [ ip ] ) ( in other words , cycles of different lengths involve approximately equal amounts of points of the discrete phase space ) .    in view of such reasonings",
    ", the inverse proportional law can be expected in case of any sufficiently reach family of unitary dtm , not only the asdtm family defined by ( [ sym ] ) ( moreover , in unitary discrete analogues of multi - modal piecewise linear ctm , not unimodular tent maps only ) .    in factual finite - precision computer simulations of more or less general ctm , distinguished from the `` pathological '' map @xmath0 @xmath3 ( about it see introduction ) , e.g. asymmetrical ctm ( [ ctm ] ) or the map @xmath0 @xmath122 with e.g. @xmath123 , it can be expected that the law ( [ ip ] ) must manifest itself sooner than ( [ asympt ] ) . indeed ,",
    "if the latter rule was true , then the very short orbits with lengths @xmath124 only ( recollect that @xmath98 is number of bits under operations ) would take all @xmath125 points of the discrete phase space .",
    "in reality , with no doubts , almost any choice of an initial point results in a long orbit ( `` chaotic trajectory '' ) , whose length @xmath45 is comparable with @xmath88 , while it is hard to hit casually into a short orbit .",
    "to resume , we performed computer statistical analysis of periodic orbits of unitary ( reversible ) discrete tent maps , and found that probability distribution of the orbits lengths well obeys the inverse proportional law ( [ ip ] ) ."
