    "it has been recognized that interval maps can exhibit a great degree of dynamical complexity .",
    "indeed , within this class are the first rigorous examples of _ deterministic dynamical systems _ which exhibit _ stochastic _ behaviour .",
    "these maps can be characterized in terms of the existence of a _ mixing _ absolutely continuous ( with respect to lebesgue ) invariant probability measure ( _ acip _ ) . in this paper",
    "we explore some geometric conditions which give rise to acip s and study their statistical properties .",
    "early examples of maps where an explicit formula for the acip can be found include the gauss map @xcite and the ulam - von neumann transformation @xcite .",
    "however , finding an explicit form for the density of the corresponding acip is not possible in most cases .",
    "instead attention has focussed on the existence of an acip by giving sufficient conditions satisfied by certain classes of transformations .",
    "early work focussed on smooth uniformly expanding systems @xcite with the last couple of decades really seeing several developments in the direction of relaxing either the uniform expansivity assumption , by allowing critical points , or the smoothness assumption , by allowing discontinuities with possibly unbounded derivative .    in this paper",
    "we make a further step along these lines by considering maps which have both critical points and discontinuities . before stating our results we give a brief review of the state of the field .      in the context of unimodal maps ( maps with a single critical point @xmath0 ) the existence of an _ acip",
    "_ can be deduced from assumptions on the derivative growth and recurrence of the post - critical orbit @xcite . if @xmath1 exponentially fast ( known as the collet - eckmann condition ) , it was also shown in @xcite , and in @xcite with an additional condition on the rate of recurrence of the critical point , that the map is stochastic in a very strong sense : the _ acip _ is mixing and exhibits exponential decay of correlations for hlder continuous observables .",
    "the first generalization of these results to maps with _ multiple critical points _ was obtained in @xcite where the existence of an _ acip _ @xmath2 was obtained under the summability condition @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the techniques used in that paper made it possible to show a direct link between the mixing properties of @xmath4 , in particular the rate of decay of correlations , and the rate of growth of @xmath5 .",
    "there is also an equally significant , and indeed much longer , list of papers concerned with _ uniformly expanding _ maps with discontinuities ( but without critical points ) in which similar results to those proved here are obtained , see @xcite for references .",
    "we remark however that most results allow discontinuities but not unbounded derivatives .",
    "this is true for example in one of the applications in @xcite in which a strategy similar to ours is applied .",
    "as far as we know the exponential decay of correlations for expanding lorenz - like maps , i.e. maps with unbounded derivatives such as the ones we consider here but with no critical points , follows from arguments in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "more recently these results have been extended in @xcite to obtain estimates for the decay of correlations for observables which are not hlder continuous .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to allow for the co - existence of _ multiple critical points _ ( with possibly different critical orders ) _ and multiple singularities _ ( points at which the map may be discontinuous and the derivative may be discontinuous or unbounded ) , see figure 1 . for such maps we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an ergodic _ acip _ and for exponential mixing .",
    "we remark that although singularities contribute to the `` expansivity '' of the system , they also give rise to significant technical issues , in particular related to distortion control .",
    "a noteworthy aspect of our argument is that we introduce a unified formalism and technique for dealing with both critical and singular points .",
    "[ map ]     another class of results which should be mentioned also applies to very general maps with non - degenerate critical and singular points but under quite different dynamical assumptions .",
    "more specifically the expansivity and recurrence conditions are assumed to hold _ asymptotically _ for _ lebesgue almost every point _ and not necessarily for the critical points .",
    "it is then possible to show the existence of an ergodic _ acip _ @xcite and to obtain bounds for the rate of decay of correlations @xcite .      to obtain the required statistical properties we construct a countable partition on a reference set and analyse the recurrence time statistics through the construction of an induced markov map",
    "this strategy , which has already been applied successfully in several contexts @xcite , is motivated by @xcite where a direct relationship between the recurrence time statistics and mixing rates is established .",
    "a similar construction is also carried out for general unimodal maps in @xcite .    inducing techniques yielding countable markov systems",
    "have been applied in other settings too .",
    "jakobson has applied this idea extensively in the context of parameter exclusion arguments for one - dimensional maps @xcite . for systems admitting infinite ergodic measures ,",
    "see @xcite for a discussion on _ gibbs markov maps _ and their statistical properties . for maps admitting",
    "neutral fixed points see the work of @xcite , where inducing schemes are used to analyse the properties of the ergodic density . in connection with metric number theory and continued fraction maps , inducing schemes are used in the work of @xcite .",
    "a theory of _ markov fibred systems _ is developed in @xcite , where inducing schemes are used to provide results on central limit theorems for a class of rational maps admitting neutral fixed points . an approach for analysing mixing rates using the gibbs - markov formalism has been developed in @xcite . here , renewal theory techniques are applied to establish sharp polynomial decay of correlations for markov systems .",
    "a particularly interesting motivation for the construction of induced markov maps is related to the development of a _ thermodynamic formalism _ for nonuniformly expanding maps based precisely on the geometrical structure of ( induced ) markov maps .",
    "this is based on some recent progress on the thermodynamic formalism for abstract countable shift spaces @xcite , recent results on the relation between invariant measures for the system and invariant measures for the markov tower extension @xcite , and the application of these results to specific classes of systems which admit induced markov maps such as those constructed in this paper @xcite .",
    "we now give the precise definition of the class of maps we consider .",
    "let @xmath6 be a compact interval and @xmath7 a @xmath8 local diffeomorphism outside a finite set @xmath9 , of _ non - degenerate critical and singular _ points .",
    "these are points at which @xmath10 may be discontinuous or the derivative of @xmath10 may vanish or be infinite . in order to treat all possibilities in a formally unified way we consider @xmath11 and @xmath12 as distinct _",
    "critical values _ , thus implicitly thinking of @xmath13 and @xmath14 as distinct critical points . when referring to a neighbourhood of a critical point , we shall always be referring to the appropriate one - sided neighbourhood of that point .",
    "we say that the critical points are _ non - degenerate _ if there exists @xmath15 and for each @xmath0 there exists a constant @xmath16 such that for each @xmath17 in a neighbourhood of @xmath0 we have    @xmath18    and in addition we assume that @xmath19 we write @xmath20 to denote the set of critical and singular points respectively .",
    "notice that two `` distinct '' points @xmath21 and @xmath22 may actually correspond to the same point in @xmath23 for which the derivative tends to zero from one side , and infinity from the other .",
    "we let @xmath24 when there is no possibility of confusion we will often use the term `` critical point '' to refer to a point of @xmath25 without necessarily specifying if @xmath26 is really a critical point in the traditional sense with @xmath27 or whether it is a singular point with @xmath28 or a `` neutral '' point with @xmath29 .",
    "for ease of exposition we assume the derivative of @xmath10 at the points of discontinuity is either unbounded or zero .",
    "to accommodate bounded derivatives , we would have to slightly modify our argument to include the case of a return to a region where there is a bounded discontinuity .",
    "the derivative growth and distortion estimates would not be affected by such bounded discontinuities .    for any @xmath30 let @xmath31 denote the distance of @xmath30 from the nearest critical point , and for small @xmath32 , let @xmath33 denote a @xmath34-neighbourhood of @xmath35 . for an arbitrary interval @xmath36 we shall also use the notation @xmath37 to denote the distance of @xmath36 from the critical set .      for all initial values",
    "@xmath38 we let @xmath39 with @xmath40 denote the iterates of @xmath41 .",
    "we formulate the following three conditions concerning respectively the expansivity of @xmath42 outside @xmath43 , the derivative growth and recurrence to @xmath25 of the _ bona fide _ critical points , and a transitivity condition on the critical orbits .",

    "we therefore obtain the following results .",

    "the exponential rate of decay represents a particularly strong form of mixing and indicates that , notwithstanding the presence of critical points and the lack of smoothness due to the presence of singularities , the system is , statistically , very similar to a uniformly expanding system . technically , this is a consequence of the bounded recurrence and exponential growth conditions ( h2 ) along the critical orbits . assuming weaker",
    "growth and recurrence conditions may give rise to slower rates of mixing .",
    "this has been shown to be the case in the smooth case @xcite and it would clearly be interesting to generalize that result to allow for the presence of singularities .",
    "another extension of our work could be to study statistical properties of intermittent systems with coexisting critical points and singularities , i.e. to include the presence of a neutral periodic point .",
    "a further natural question concerns the convergence of averages of functions along orbits to their expected values , in particular we can ask if a distributional law like the _ central limit theorem _ ( clt ) holds : for any measurable set @xmath105 and @xmath106 with @xmath107 there exists some @xmath108 such that @xmath109 we have the following result :    [ thm_cor ] the central limit theorem holds for @xmath110 and any hlder observable @xmath111 such that @xmath112 for any @xmath113 .",

    "the resulting chopped up subintervals are iterated independently , and at some later time these subintervals will return back to @xmath118 . using the fixed partition",

    "a chopping method is devised in such a way that @xmath10 ( and its iterates ) act diffeomorphically , with bounded distortion on each chopped - up subinterval .",
    "moreover , it could be envisaged that components may get cut too fast in the chopping procedure , or fail to grow in size due to frequent returns to @xmath35 .",
    "this can happen , but we will show that _ on average _ there is a tendency to grow in size ( at an exponential rate ) .",
    "sections [ sec_bind ] and [ distest ] contain two fundamental technical results , one on the recovery of the loss of expansion ( due to the small derivative ) for returns to @xmath121 by shadowing the critical orbit , and another on some global distortion bounds which follow from the combinatorial construction . in the core section [ escest ]",

    "@xmath358 : if @xmath36 is an escape component belonging to @xmath616 then @xmath621 using the bounded distortion property from proposition [ escapedist ] this ratio is preserved for the initial interval @xmath36 up to the bounded distortion constant @xmath310 to get @xmath622 continuing in this way we get @xmath623 letting @xmath624 we then apply one more iteration of this formula to get @xmath625 where @xmath626 thus for each @xmath508 we have @xmath627 where @xmath628 is the number of possible sequences @xmath629 such that @xmath630 , and therefore @xmath631 using exactly the same counting argument used in the proof of lemma [ combestlem ] we can choose @xmath632 arbitrarily small as long as @xmath633 and @xmath634 is sufficiently small , so that @xmath635 .",
    "this gives @xmath636 since both @xmath634 and @xmath637 can be taken arbitrarily small , the result follows .",
    "notice that taking @xmath634 small ( and thus obtaining @xmath637 small ) does not depend on choosing @xmath216 or @xmath197 sufficiently small as @xmath634 can be chosen arbitrarily in the decomposition of the sum in .      to bound the set of points which have many escapes we use a softer argument .",
    "clearly we have @xmath638 by lemma [ retpart ] there is a fixed proportion @xmath639 of _ the image _",
    "@xmath640 of each escaping component which actually has a `` full return '' to @xmath69 within @xmath208 iterates after this escape . using the bounded distortion estimate in proposition [ escapedist ]",
    "again this translates to a minimum proportion @xmath641 of the actual interval @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the maximum proportion of @xmath642 which is even allowed potentially to have a second escape ( whether it be before or after time @xmath167 ) is bounded by @xmath643 and so we have @xmath644 iterating this formula we get @xmath645 and so there exists some constant @xmath608 such that @xmath646 the statement in the lemma follows with @xmath647 .",
    "by proposition [ main_tail ] , we know the tail of the return times is decaying exponentially fast and thus @xmath71 is indeed a partition of @xmath69 , while by proposition [ escapedist ] , we have the required bounded distortion property .",
    "thus together , these two propositions imply theorem [ thm_markov ] .",
    "moreover , the construction and estimates given above also yield the following additional properties which will be used below : there exists some @xmath648 such that @xmath649 and there exists a constant @xmath650 such that @xmath651 indeed , follows by the same expansion estimates used repeatedly in the proof and follows almost trivially from the bounded distortion property and the fact that @xmath36 never gets bigger than @xmath195 .",
    "it remains to show how these properties imply the required statistical properties .",
    "the bounded distortion property of the induced map @xmath652 implies , by classical results , the existence of an ergodic , in fact mixing , absolutely continuous invariant measure @xmath653 for @xmath654 with bounded density with respect to lebesgue .",
    "therefore , the exponential tail of the return time function @xmath79 implies in that @xmath655 this means that the measure obtained by _ pushing forward _",
    "@xmath653 by iterates of the original map @xmath42 is finite and thus , after normalization , yields an absolutely continuous probability measure @xmath4 which , again by standard arguments , is also @xmath42-invariant and ergodic , and in fact mixing for some power of @xmath42 .",
    "the expansivity estimates obtained above clearly imply that @xmath2 has a positive lypaunov exponent .",
    "first of all we define a _ markov extension _ or _",
    "markov tower_. let @xmath656 be a copy @xmath117 and let @xmath657 be a copy of the element @xmath658 of the partition @xmath71 .",
    "the return time function @xmath659 is constant on partition elements @xmath657 with value @xmath660 . then define @xmath661 where @xmath662 so @xmath663 is the disjoint union of @xmath664 copies of each @xmath657 .",
    "define the _ tower map _ @xmath665 by setting @xmath666 for @xmath667 and @xmath668 @xmath669 is markov with respect to the partition @xmath670 and the return map @xmath671 , or equivalently @xmath672 , is full branched markov with respect to the partition @xmath673 on @xmath674 .      define the projection @xmath675 by @xmath676 .",
    "clearly , @xmath677 is a semi - conjugacy between @xmath669 and @xmath10 : @xmath678 using the projection @xmath679 , any measure @xmath680 on @xmath681 can be projected to a measure @xmath682 on @xmath211 with the property that @xmath683 for every measurable set @xmath684 .",
    "moreover any observable @xmath685 can be lifted to an observable @xmath686 notice that implies @xmath687 therefore , for any two observables @xmath688 and their corresponding lifts @xmath689 , any measure @xmath690 and its corresponding projection @xmath691 it is sufficient to prove statistical properties for the lifts on the tower to obtain similar results for the original map using the fact that @xmath679 is a `` measure - preserving '' ( by definition , since one measure is the projection of the other by @xmath679 ) semi - conjugacy . for example , for the correlation function we have @xmath692 an important observation however is that the properties must be proved on the tower for all observables which can be obtained as lifts of suitable ( hlder continuous ) observables on the manifold .      in this section",
    "we state precisely the results of young @xcite which give conditions for the exponential decay of certain classes of observables for the map @xmath693 and for the central limit theorem .",
    "young s setting is very general and only requires @xmath148 to be a measure space with some reference measure @xmath694 and the markov tower structure described above .",
    "the markov structure naturally induces a symbolic metric on @xmath681 which can be used to define notions of regularity both for the jacobian of @xmath695 and for observables on @xmath681 .",
    "first of all we define a _ separation time _ : if @xmath696 for some @xmath697 , then @xmath698 if @xmath699 lie in distinct partition elements , then @xmath700 . if @xmath701 then write @xmath702 , @xmath703 where @xmath704 and define @xmath705 .",
    "then , for a fixed constant @xmath706 , we define @xmath707 by the expansivity property of @xmath708 any two distinct points eventually separate and therefore this defines a metric on @xmath681 .",
    "let @xmath712 be a markov map on a tower @xmath713 with a reference measure @xmath694 , a markov return map @xmath714 , an exponential tail of the return time function @xmath715 , and such that the greatest common divisor of all values taken by the function @xmath79 is 1 .",
    "let @xmath716 denote the jacobian of @xmath717 with respect to the reference measure @xmath694 .",
    "suppose that the following bounded distortion condition holds : there exists a constant @xmath718 such that for all @xmath719 we have @xmath720 then the correlation function @xmath721 decays exponentially fast ( at a uniform rate ) for every observable @xmath722 and @xmath723 .",
    "moreover , the central limit theorem holds for every @xmath723 .",
    "notice that the bounded distortion condition is the _ only _ assumption of the theorem over and above the markov tower structure , the exponential decay of the return time function , and the assumption on the greatest common divisor of @xmath724 .",
    "moreover , both the exponential tail and the assumption on the gcd can be relaxed to some extent .",
    "if the gcd of @xmath725 is @xmath726 we can just consider @xmath727 which will continue to have the same markov structure and properties and a return time function @xmath728 with gcd ( @xmath729 ) .",
    "the exponential decay of the tail of the return time function can also be relaxed to assume only subexponential or even polynomial decay ( in fact including these cases is one of the main motivations for @xcite ) , although in this case the rate of decay of the correlation function is correspondingly slower .      to obtain our desired results for @xmath42 we therefore just need to show that the the bounded distortion condition of proposition [ escapedist ] implies the required bounded distortion condition in the symbolic metric , and that observables on @xmath211 which are hlder continuous with respect to the usual euclidean metric lift to bounded observables on @xmath681 which are hlder continuous in the symbolic metric .      for the bounded distortion condition ,",
    "notice first of all that @xmath708 is differentiable in our setting and therefore the left hand side of formulated in terms of the jacobian of @xmath695 is exactly the same as the left hand side of the second inequality in proposition [ escapedist ] formulated in terms of the derivative of @xmath730 , with @xmath731 .",
    "thus all we need to show is that @xmath732 for any two points @xmath733 belonging to the same element of the partition @xmath734 . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath735 be the expansion constant in , then cylinder sets are shrinking exponentially at rate @xmath736 and so we have @xmath737      let @xmath741 be hlder continuous : there exists @xmath742 such that @xmath743 for any two @xmath744 .",
