    "we have witnessed a proliferate growth in theoretical and experimental efforts to understand and control physical systems in a quantum level . in particular ,",
    "possibilities to apply quantum mechanics toward the radical improvement of information technology have magnetized attention from various branches of physics and beyond .",
    "ever since the advent of lasers , optics has been closely related to the foundations and applications of quantum physics because of its controllability to a very fine level .",
    "however , photons do not interact each other , which makes it difficult to engineer their states . in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "various schemes have been suggested .    in a quantum optics laboratory , gaussian states ,",
    "whose phase properties are described by gaussian probability - like functions , were generated but there was some limitation to use them for various tasks of quantum information processing .",
    "there have been suggestions and realisations to engineer the quantum state by subtracting or adding photons from / to a gaussian field .",
    "photon subtraction and addition to a given state are plausible ways to manipulate a quantum state .",
    "many of the quantum optics textbooks start with the definition of annihilation @xmath0 and creation @xmath1 operators . when they are applied to @xmath2 which represents a state with @xmath3 number of photons : @xmath4 it is easy to recognize that by annihilating ( creating ) a photon the photon number changes to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) but it is not straightforward to acknowledge the coefficient @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .    in 1924 , bose  @xcite found that the most chaotic light bears the spectrum of planck s formula at a given temperature under the two assumptions 1 ) light is composed of indistinguishable particles and 2 ) any number of particles can occupy one quantum state .",
    "this is the first full quantum - mechanical explanation of the planck s formula for the blackbody radiation .",
    "einstein extended bose s idea to the quantum theory of an ideal gas  @xcite . as a whole , the particles which bear the statistics under bose s assumptions are now called as ` bosons ' .",
    "first assumption is against his contemporary belief that particles are always distinguishable . in the theory of identical particles ,",
    "bose s second assumption naturally brings about the symmetric nature for the state of bosons in contrast to anti - symmetric states to fermions .",
    "let us assume three photons labelled as 1,2 and 3 in the same state @xmath9 .",
    "the three photon state can then be written as @xmath10 in the fock state representation , this state is denoted by @xmath11 . subtracting a photon from this three photon state is due to subtracting either photon 1 , 2 or 3 .",
    "this means that the subtraction operation is represented by a symmetric operator @xmath12 where subtracting photon @xmath13 is represented by @xmath14 .",
    "applying @xmath15 onto @xmath16 , we obtain @xmath17 in the fock representation .",
    "we thus find that by the subtraction of a photon , the state becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the coefficient required by the annihilation operation in ( [ 1 ] ) when @xmath20 for the state in eq .",
    "( [ symmetric ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the coefficient @xmath19 appears naturally from the argument of the symmetric nature of bosonic particles .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath7 appears in eq.([1 ] ) , in fact , tells us that ` _ the probability of a transition in which a boson is absorbed ... is proportional to the number of bosons originally in the state _ ' as dirac writes  @xcite .",
    "similarly we can prove that the creation of a photon in state @xmath2 gets the coefficient @xmath8 as in eq.([1 ] ) purely using the symmetric nature of the bosonic particles .",
    "on the other hand , we know that in harmonic oscillator , whose dynamics has a periodic nature like a wave , the lowering and raising operators , respectively to go down and up the energy ladder also have the same mathematical structure as in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ( see for example , chapter 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . observing that the two are described by the same mathematical formulae but looked at from two different points of view , dirac writes this equivalence as _one of the most fundamental results of quantum mechanics , which enables a unification of the wave and corpuscular theories of light to be effected._  @xcite .",
    "we can easily derive the commutation relation between the annihilation and creation operators using eq.([1 ] ) : @xmath21=1 .",
    "$ ] in this tutorial , we show how to realise the operation of annihilation and creation of a photon .",
    "we then show how to engineer a quantum state using the properties of annihilation and creation operations .",
    "we start with a brief review in order to make this tutorial as self - contained as possible .",
    "the annihilation and creation operators are not hermitian , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath22 , as is clear in eq.([1 ] ) , which means that these operators are not measurable .",
    "thus we define quadrature operators as linear combinations of the two operators @xmath23 which are hermitian and measurable .",
    "the @xmath24-th order moment of @xmath25 is @xmath26 similarly , we can find @xmath27 . by defining the characteristic function for a field with its density operator @xmath28 as @xmath29 \\label{5}\\ ] ]",
    "we can calculate the @xmath24-th order moments of @xmath25 and @xmath30 at once : @xmath31 the characteristic function @xmath32 is called the weyl characteristic function .    in quantum optics , the exponential operator in eq.([5 ] ) is called as the displacement operator , @xmath33 : @xmath34 where the complex number @xmath35 . in phase space composed of two conjugate variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath33 displaces a state by ( re[@xmath38 , im[@xmath38 ) hence the name  @xcite : @xmath39    in probability theory , the characteristic function is fourier - transformed to give a probability density function to tell us about the probability of finding a system at the certain value of @xmath37 and @xmath36 .",
    "however , because of the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics , it is prohibited to simultaneously allocate certain measurement values to conjugate variables .",
    "thus , in quantum mechanics , the probability density can not be defined in phase space . by the fourier transformation of the weyl characteristic function ( [ 5 ] )",
    ", we get a function which is like a probability density function so to call it a quasiprobability function  @xcite : @xmath40 where subscripts @xmath41 and @xmath42 refer to the real and imaginary parts ( this convention is used throughout the paper ) .",
    "the quasiprobability function was first introduced by wigner  @xcite as an effort to define a probability - like function in phase space .",
    "he derived it under the condition that the marginal probabilities @xmath43 and @xmath43 of the probability - like function @xmath44 has to be the true probability functions for the respective variables @xmath37 and @xmath36 .",
    "the wigner function has a one - to - one correspondence to the density operator and identifies a physical state uniquely . in practical reasons ,",
    "the wigner function is very often used to represent the state of a physical system .",
    "the vacuum state , which is the energy ground state , of a field is denoted by @xmath45 . using eq.([wigner ] ) , we can find its wigner function in the gaussian function . by applying the displacement operator @xmath46 on @xmath45 , the peak of the wigner function is moved by @xmath47 and we obtain @xmath48=w_{|0\\rangle}(\\alpha-\\beta ) , \\label{wigner-0}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the wigner function for the vacuum .",
    "glauber  @xcite introduced the displaced vacuum to analyse the higher - order coherence and called such the state as the coherent state : @xmath50 .",
    "an ideal laser is assumed to be in a coherent state even though there is some dispute because the phase of a laser field is completely unknown ( see @xcite ) .    as an example , let us consider to measure the quadrature phase of a superposition of two coherent states with @xmath51 phase difference : @xmath52 where @xmath47 is assumed to be real .",
    "this state has been studied in conjunction with the schrdinger paradox  @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) and will be discussed further in the latter sections . as an example , when @xmath53 , the wigner function of the coherent superposition state is calculated as @xmath54 .",
    "\\label{superposition - wigner}\\ ] ] it is clear that the wigner function can be negative at some points of the phase space , which confirms that the wigner function is not a probability function . in fact , the negativity in phase space is considered to be a signature of nonclassicality for a state .",
    "there have been attempts to observe the negativity in experiment , which will be discussed later .",
    "another important state of light to mention is a squeezed state . by a @xmath55 nonlinear interaction , a photon in the input pump field",
    "is converted into two photons conserving the energy and momentum . arranging the phase - matching condition ,",
    "the two photons can be emitted into the same mode @xmath56 , in which case the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath57 .",
    "the strength of the pump laser and the nonlinear coefficient determine the coupling parameter @xmath58 .",
    "on the other hand , if the two daughter photons are emitted into two distinctive modes @xmath56 and @xmath59 , the interaction hamiltonian becomes @xmath60 .",
    "the dynamics of the field in modes @xmath56 and @xmath59 can be obtained by applying the evolution operator depending on the hamiltonian .",
    "assuming that the field is initially prepared with nothing , _",
    "i.e. _ in the vacuum state @xmath45 , at the interaction time @xmath61 it transforms into @xmath62 in the case of single - mode emission .",
    "the evolution operator @xmath63 is called the single - mode squeezing operator and the state in eq.([sq1 ] ) is called the squeezed state ( or , more precisely , squeezed vacuum )",
    ". there may be other types of squeezed states by applying the squeezing operator to various initial states . in this paper , however , we will be interested mainly in the squeezed vacuum .",
    "after the decomposition of the squeezing operator , we can calculate the precise form of the squeezed vacuum in the fock state basis ( see the derivation in @xcite and appendix 5 in @xcite ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is considered to be real for simplicity .",
    "it is immediately recognised that there are only even numbers of photons to be realised in this state , which reflects the nature of twin photon generation by the @xmath55 nonlinear interaction .",
    "the unitary transformation of the bosonic operator is @xmath66    if two photons are emitted into two distinctive modes , the vacuum state evolves into @xmath67 where the evolution operator is now the two - mode squeezing operator @xmath68 with the squeezing parameter @xmath69 .",
    "again , the decomposition of the two - mode squeezing operator @xmath68 has been used and @xmath65 has been assumed real for simplicity .",
    "we observe in the two - mode squeezed state ( [ sq2 ] ) that if there are @xmath3 photons in mode @xmath56 , we can say that there are also @xmath3 photons in mode @xmath59 without having to measure it .",
    "this ` deterministic nature ' of the quantum state is an important ingredient of quantum correlation , so - called _ entanglement _ , the detail of which will be further discussed later .",
    "the unitary transformations of bosonic operators are @xmath70 the generation of an entangled state from a single - mode squeezed vacuum has been discussed in @xcite ( see a review article @xcite ) .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ sq1-state ] ) in the definition of the weyl characteristic function ( [ 5 ] ) , it is clear that the squeezing operator transforms the coordinates of phase space , expanding one axis at the expense of contracting the other .",
    "the wigner function for the single - mode squeezed state is calculated to be @xmath71 the wigner function thus appears squeezed in phase space hence the name squeezed state .",
    "in fact , the unitary transformations ( [ unitary - s1 ] ) and ( [ unitary - s2 ] ) are the linear transformations of the set of initial bosonic operators to that of the output bosonic operators : in other words , we can write the transformation in the following general form with the actual form of the transformation matrix @xmath72 to be determined accordingly , @xmath73 huang and agarwal have shown that the initial gaussian wigner function remains gaussian after a linear transformation of bosonic operators of fields  @xcite .",
    "they then showed that the action of a beam splitter , squeezer , linear amplifier are all described by a linear transformation . with the reasons of mathematical handedness and experimental relevance , a gaussian state in single - mode and multimode fields",
    "have been extensively studied .    throughout the paper ,",
    "a homodyne detector is used to measure the properties of the light field .",
    "the quantum theory of homodyne detection was originated by yuen and shapiro  @xcite . in order to measure quadrature variables",
    ", the homodyne detector makes use of interference between a reference field , called a local oscillator , and the field to probe , by superposing them at a beam splitter .",
    "let us consider a lossless beam splitter of two input ports of modes @xmath56 and @xmath59 and two output ports of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . using the su(2 ) symmetry , campos , saleh and teich  @xcite",
    "have developed the beam splitter operator @xmath76 with the reflectivity @xmath77 and the transmittivity @xmath78 .",
    "it is important to note that the beam splitter operator is unitary to conserve energy between input and output fields . due to the unitary nature",
    ", in fact , two identical photons respectively put into two input ports interfere at the beam splitter to exit together at an output port .",
    "this is the basic idea of the so - called hong - ou - mandel interferometer which appears often in quantum technology to prove the identity of two photons  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we fix the phase difference given by the beam splitter to @xmath79 , for convenience .",
    "the unitary transformation by a beam splitter is then @xmath80 which is again a linear transformation .",
    "photon numbers are measured at the beam splitter output ports and the difference between them is @xmath81 where the photon number operators @xmath82 and @xmath83 . for a 50:50 beam splitter with @xmath84 ,",
    "the photon number difference is @xmath85 the homodyne detector with the 50:50 beam splitter is specially called as the balanced homodyne detector .",
    "now , we take a strong laser field as the local oscillator which means the local oscillator can be considered as a classical field to replace the bosonic operators with its dimensionless amplitude @xmath86 and phase @xmath87 : @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this approximation brings @xmath90 it is easily seen that the photon number difference is the scaled quadrature operator .",
    "when @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "when @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "now , it is clear that quadrature operators can be measured by the homodyne detector .",
    "in fact , by changing @xmath87 , we can measure not only two conjugate operators @xmath25 and @xmath30 but also the phase value along any rotated axis in phase space . by defining the quadrature operator @xmath95",
    ", we have the correspondence of the measured value to the quadrature variable : @xmath96 .    according to the probability theory ,",
    "the probability of photon number difference is the fourier transformation : @xmath97 where @xmath98.\\ ] ] comparing eq.([p ] ) with eq.([wigner ] ) , we can find that @xmath99 is proportional to the marginal wigner function .",
    "the probability of photon number difference is the marginal wigner function whose axis is determined by the phase of the local oscillator . with this observation , risken and",
    "vogel proposed to reconstruct the wigner function using the homodyne measurement outcomes by rotating the local oscillator phase  @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called optical tomography .",
    "the homodyne detector is also known for its high efficiency . without approximating the local oscillator as a classical field ,",
    "braunstein assessed the reliability of the homodyne measurement as a measurement of quadrature phase , depending on the intensity of the local oscillator  @xcite .",
    "he found that the strength of the local oscillator is not sufficient to ensure that a homodyne detector acts like an ideal detector of quadrature phase .",
    "before we finish this section , let us go back to the wigner function .",
    "as it is not possible to define a probability density function in phase space , we had to define a quasiprobability function which is a probability like function . as it is not the true probability function , it is not surprising to have more than one quasiprobability function  @xcite . using the campbell - baker - hausdorf theorem]=[\\hat{b},[\\hat{a},\\hat{b}]]=0 $ ] , then @xmath100/2)$].-see , for example , p.42 - 44 of @xcite for a proof . ] the displacement operator in eq .",

    "however , @xmath110 does not have to be positive according to the definition .",
    "when @xmath112 , @xmath110 becomes the wigner function .",
    "when @xmath113 , @xmath110 refers to the quasiprobability for normally ordered operators and called as the glauber - sudarshan @xmath114 function to honour its inventors  @xcite ( throughout the paper , the glauber sudarshan @xmath114 function is referred by the @xmath114 function for simplicity ) .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath114 function is related to the density operator through the following equation @xmath115 it is known that any moments of photon number operators should be normally ordered  @xcite , for example @xmath116 where @xmath117 stands for normal - ordering .",
    "the photon number variance is then @xmath118 if the @xmath114 function is positive then @xmath119 can be considered as a probability function and the normally ordered variance will be positive . however ,",
    "if @xmath114 function is not a well - behaved positive function , the normally ordered variance does not have to be positive .",
    "the non - existence of the positive well - behaved @xmath114 function is thus considered to be a sign of nonclassicality for a given field .    now , we have seen two criteria of nonclassicality : one is based on negativity of the wigner function and the other is based on the non - existence of the well - behaved @xmath114 function .",
    "these two conditions do not necessarily coincide so there seems to be a subtle problem to be settled .",
    "in fact , as we can show later , the positivity of @xmath114 function guarantees the positivity of the wigner function but the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "we can obtain @xmath120 from another quasiprobability function @xmath110 for @xmath121  @xcite : @xmath122 which appears as a convolution of @xmath110 with a gaussian function and its effect is to bring the peaks of @xmath120 broader than those of @xmath110 ( in fact , this broadening reminds us of a decoherence process of the field and the detail has been studied using the gaussian convolution theory  @xcite ) . the @xmath106-parameterised quasiprobability function ( [ quasi - s ] ) together with ( [ character - s ] ) can be written as @xmath123 \\label{p - t}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 .",

    "the @xmath106-parameterised quasiprobability function is positive well - behaved for any state .",

    "the combination of the subtraction and addition has been successfully demonstrated in @xcite .    in order to illustrate how to add and subtract a photon ,",
    "let us consider a perfect single - mode cavity where a state of a field has been prepared ( see fig .",

    "however , according to the input - output theory , the photon subtraction and addition assisted by a cavity does not seem to be an optimum solution even though a cavity may be a candidate for other types of light field engineering .",

    "apart from the test of nonlocality based on the epr paradox and bell s inequality , the concept of entanglement has been extensively studied as one of the key resources for the current development of quantum information processing . while the test of nonlocality is using physical observables , entanglement started as a mathematical concept . when a composite system of two subsystems a and b is not entangled ( separable )",
    ", the density @xmath28 of the composite system can be written as a statistical sum @xmath299 where @xmath300 is a probability function and @xmath301 and @xmath302 are density operators for subsystems a and b , respectively . a density operator is a positive normalised operator and its transposition is again a density operator .",
    "thus a partial transposition , @xmath303^{\\mbox{\\tiny{t}}}\\hat{\\rho}_i^b , \\label{ppt}\\ ] ] of a separable density operator ( [ separable ] ) has to be positive , where the superscripts pt and t denote partial transposition and transposition .",
    "thus , using the converse , we can say that the negativity of the partially transposed density operator is a sufficient condition for the entanglement of the composite system .",
    "the horodecki family proved that the negative partial transposition ( npt ) condition is also a necessary condition for the entanglement of certain classes of composite systems  @xcite .",
    "a few years later , lee _ et al . _ proved that the npt is an entanglement monotone thus can be used as a measure of entanglement for a spin-@xmath291 system  @xcite , which was extended to a high - dimensional system by vidal and werner  @xcite . for a gaussian two - mode field ,",
    "the npt is also a sufficient and necessary condition  @xcite for entanglement . on the other hand , for a non - gaussian two - mode field",
    ", a more elaborative entanglement condition applies  @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement is a mathematically well - defined concept and quite universal in the sense that entanglement in a composite system means its possession of quantum - mechanical correlation , regardless of its usefulness for a particular task .",
    "quantum teleportation , on the other hand , is a physical task for which entanglement of a quantum channel is necessary for its success . even though quantum entanglement is not a sufficient condition ,",
    "the success of quantum teleportation can be regarded as a physically measurable witness of entanglement . in this sense ,",
    "the nonlocality test discussed earlier is another experimentally accessible entanglement witness .",
    "after the two particles of a perfect entangled pair are shared between two remote stations , the quantum state to be teleported and one particle of the entangled pair are jointly measured at one station .",
    "the other particle of the entangled pair at the other station is then collapsed into a state .",
    "the original quantum information can be recovered by a unitary transformation according to the classical message on the measurement outcome ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on quantum teleportation of a coherent state and continuous variables . ) .      for a two - mode ( modes @xmath56 and @xmath59 ) continuous - variable system defined in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space",
    ", a maximally entangled state is @xmath304 which is unnormalised and the energy is infinite",
    "hence the state is unphysical . on the other hand , the two - mode squeezed state @xmath305 in eq .",
    "( [ sq2 ] ) is entangled with a finite degree .",
    "the degree of entanglement for a pure state can be obtained by the von neumann entropy of the marginal density operator of a subsystem .",
    "for the two - mode squeezed state of density operator @xmath306 , the degree of entanglement @xmath307 is @xmath308 \\label{von - n}\\ ] ] where @xmath309 the marginal density operator of the two - mode squeezed state is already diagonalised so that the calculation is rather straightforward but for a general two - mode state , diagonalisation may be a challenging task .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath310 , based on a linearised entropy , can be more easily calculated even though it does not provide statistical information as well as the von neumann entropy does .    because of the experimental limitations , a highly entangled state is difficult to obtain .",
    "for example , in the first demonstration of the continuous - variable quantum teleportation  @xcite , the squeezing was low hence the low entanglement of the quantum channel and the average fidelity of quantum teleportation was @xmath311 , which is just above the classical limit of 50% . in order to improve the fidelity of quantum teleportation , opatrn , kurizki and welsch  @xcite suggested to select an optimal subensemble of entangled fields based on a conditional measurement , which is in effect subtracting a photon from each mode of the two - mode squeezed state .",
    "once the quantum channel is prepared in this way , the rest of the quantum teleportation protocol is performed . for the initial state of a coherent superposition state",
    ", they show the improvement of the teleportation fidelity . at the end of their investigation ,",
    "opatrn and colleagues briefly discuss that they do not find an improvement of quantum teleportation for the quantum channel prepared by adding a definite number of photons to each mode of the two - mode squeezed state .",
    "olivares , paris and bonifacio  @xcite , on the other hand , considered the photon subtraction using on - off photodetectors and showed the improvement of quantum teleportation depending on various parameters involved .    the von neumann entropy measure @xmath307 of entanglement for the two - mode squeezed state when the squeezing parameter @xmath312 is 2.34 while that is increased to 3.53 for the photon - subtracted squeezed state .",
    "the linearised entropy measure @xmath313 of entanglement also shows that the photon - subtracted squeezed state is more highly entangled than the original squeezed state for non - zero squeezing : @xmath314 where @xmath315 and @xmath316 is the density operator for the field after a photon is subtracted from each mode of the two - mode squeezed vacuum , @xmath317 cochrane , ralph and milburn  @xcite calculated the photon number distribution @xmath318 for the marginal state @xmath319 : @xmath320 as can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : photon - number ] , the photon number distribution is peaked sharply at @xmath221 for the two - mode squeezed state while for the single - photon subtracted squeezed state , the peak is moved to @xmath20 and the width of the distribution is wider with a smooth peak .",
    "entanglement has two important ingredients : random and deterministic nature . as can be seen in the singlet state ( [ singlet ] ) , before the measurement a subsystem is equally likely be measured in spin up or down ; hence the random nature .",
    "however , once the measurement is performed on a subsystem , the state of the other subsystem collapses into an eigenstate of the measurement so that we can predict the measurement outcome without measurement ; hence the deterministic nature . in order to further the analysis , let us consider a pure entangled state @xmath321 with real @xmath187 and @xmath188 . when @xmath322 , the outcome of the first measurement is maximally random .",
    "now , we perform local unitary transformations @xmath323 to rotate spins in such a way , @xmath324 turns into @xmath325_b + { 1\\over2}|\\downarrow\\rangle_a[(c_0+c_1)|\\uparrow\\rangle- ( c_0-c_1)|\\downarrow\\rangle]_b.\\ ] ] two states @xmath326 for particle b are not orthogonal to each other unless @xmath327 . because of the ambiguity due to non - orthogonality , the correlation between particles a and b is not as clear as for the singlet case ( @xmath328 when @xmath322 ) .",
    "extending this idea , we can say that the enhancement of entanglement is related to the flatter weights of each component states in the photon subtracted squeezed state .    as discussed earlier in eq .",
    "( [ on - off ] ) , the experimental realisation of single - photon measurements is approximated by an on - off photodetector . in this case ,",
    "once a measurement is done on one mode , the field of the other mode is collapsed into a mixed state .",
    "_ studied the degree of entanglement for the photon subtracted two - mode squeezed state with this experimental consideration  @xcite .",
    "while the original epr paradox was on a continuous - variable system , bell , chsh and many followers developed inequalities for the so - called bohm s version of the epr state , which is for a spin-@xmath291 system .",
    "this system has only two measurement outcomes so that it is much easier to treat than the infinite - dimensional continuous variables .",
    "( there have been discussions on the validity of a nonlocality test for a multichotomic , many observables and many - dimensional system .",
    "as this is beyond the scope of the present paper , we will refer to ref .",
    "@xcite and references there in for further studies . )",
    "bell wrote that the epr state , which is simulated by a two - mode squeezed state when the squeezing parameter is infinity , would not violate his inequality because its wigner function is positive everywhere in phase space .",
    "using the fact that a gaussian state transforms into a non - gaussian state by subtracting a photon , nha and carmichael  @xcite suggested the chsh bell s inequality test for a two - mode squeezed state , conditioned on subtraction of a photon from each mode of the state .",
    "their dichotomic observable is based on a homodyne measurement , which has high detection efficiency to avoid a detection loophole in an experimental nonlocality test . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ homodyne - theta ] ) , the phase value is measured by a homodyne detector .",
    "the observable setting is determined by the phase of a local oscillator ( @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ homodyne - theta ] ) ) .    for the dichotomic value , + 1 is endorsed when the measurement outcome is positive and -1 otherwise . in their analysis ,",
    "nha and carmichael considered the realistic way to subtract a photon using a beam splitter and an on - off photodetector .",
    "they found that the chsh bell s inequality is violated even when the squeezing parameter @xmath65 is as small as 0.48 as far as the transmittivity of the beam splitter is high ( @xmath329 ) .",
    "they also found that the scheme is quite insensitive to the detection efficiency of the on - off detector .",
    "it is because if a photon is not detected , they will anyway throw away the data so losing a photon is not a problem . in the same sense , losing a photon does not cause a problem in the on - off photodetector .",
    "nha and carmichael carefully remark against the possible fallacy due to the selection of data as the test is conditioned on subtraction of a photon .",
    "they say  @xcite ` _ the situation differs from the so - called detection loophole which asserts that unfair data sampling can lead to the violation of a bell inequality even for a classcially correlated state .",
    "_ '    garca - patrn _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite also studied the same system and assert that the local hidden variable theory does not change at all by the subtraction process because it can not be influenced by the two local homodyne measurements .",
    "they considered the detection efficiency of the homodyne detectors and found 1% of chsh bell s inequality violation for the homodyne efficiency of about 95% . in a longer version of this work ,",
    "garca - patrn , fiursek and cerf  @xcite extended the scheme to consider various scenarios to subtract photons using beam splitters and on - off photodetectors .",
    "they found that the violation would increase by subtracting one , two and four photons from each mode but no violation occurs by subtracting three photons .      despite theoretical studies on increasing nonlocality violation and teleportation fidelity",
    ", experimental realisation has not been made to subtract photons from each mode of the field .",
    "it is because the probability of subtracting a photon from one mode is already very rare and difficult so that coincidence subtraction of two photons is technically extremely demanding .",
    "however , there is a scheme which is less demanding because only one photon subtraction is involved to increase entanglement .",
    "if the subtraction is ideal for the operation to be represented simply by an annihilation operator , a single - photon subtraction from one mode of the two - mode squeezed state will increase its entanglement .",
    "the two - mode squeezed state turns into @xmath330 the linearised entropy entanglement measure for this is @xmath331 which is higher than its counter part for the initial two - mode squeezed state for all nonzero squeezing parameter @xmath65 .",
    "ourjoumtsev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite use a technique to subtract only one photon but by erasing the information on the path information of the subtracted photon , they increase the degree of entanglement .",
    "let us consider a scheme to annihilate a photon from one of the modes of a two - mode field .",
    "then the operation is described by @xmath332 .",
    "after this operation , the two - mode squeezed state @xmath305 turns into @xmath333 the marginal density operator for mode @xmath56 can be calculated as @xmath334 : @xmath335_a\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose @xmath336 is larger than @xmath337 .",
    "@xcite increases the degree of entanglement by subtracting one photon from one of the mode of a two - mode squeezed state .",
    "pd : photodetector , and t : transmittance of the beam splitter .",
    "[ fig : our ]    with the experimental setup as in fig .",
    "[ fig : our ] , ourjoumtsev _ et al . _",
    "show an enhancement of entanglement for small squeezing . in the experiment , as an on - off photodetector is used , the resultant state in the experiment is mixed .",
    "thus the von neumann entropy or the linear entropy can not be used to measure the entanglement .",
    "they reconstruct the density matrix from the homodyne measurements , then using the entanglement monotone based on the npt condition  @xcite they show that the photon - subtracted state has higher entanglement",
    "since its advent , a laser light field has been an important tool to provide experimental evidences of paradoxical ideas in quantum physics . in the current development of quantum information processing and quantum control of a system , it is very useful to generate a light field in an arbitrary quantum state . in this paper",
    ", we have revised how to engineer the quantum state of a travelling light field using beam splitters , parametric amplifiers , photodetectors and homodyne detectors .",
    "we have seen that single - photon subtraction and addition are possible and these have been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "it is also possible to increase entanglement of a two - mode light field using the same technique .",
    "even though a sequence of subtraction or addition enables to engineer a quantum state to an arbitrary state , it is experimentally demanding .",
