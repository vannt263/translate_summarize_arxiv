    ", we instead took the exact solution of the 2d hydrogen atom according to the above consideration .",
    "the ratio of the oscillator strengths was derived with the fermi golden rule  @xcite using the present energy eigenvalues and the reduced effective masses .",

    "[ fig : reflectivity ] ) .",
    "the substantial differences in the energy levels and in the oscillator strengths between the exciton spectra of the 2h and 3r structures were captured by the model calculation .",
    "since all the parameters in the 2h and 3r cases are similar to each other except @xmath97 , we attribute the differences solely to the 2d confinement of the electrons and holes in the 3r compound .    to see another aspect of the 2h and 3r excitons with respect to their dimensionality , we examined the exciton radii by using a simple trial wave function @xcite for the @xmath85 eigenstate of eq .",

    ", we used a finite @xmath111 listed in table  [ tab : parameters - in - the - model ] to estimate an upper bound of @xmath115 .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath114 are almost the same values for the 2h and 3r structures : 19 and 15 , respectively . in contrast , the values of @xmath115 are 8.9 and 2.7  for the 2h and 3r structures , respectively . comparing these values with the interlayer distance ( 6.1  for both structures ) , we can see that the 3r exciton is tightly confined in a single layer while the 2h exciton extends to the neighboring layers .",
    "the present results establish the 2d nature of the valley exciton in bulk mos@xmath1 with the 3r stacking . note that an apparently similar confinement effect has also been discussed for the 2h stacking as the spin - layer locking effect  @xcite . since the magnitude of confinement is governed by the factor @xmath116 with @xmath117 being the spin - orbit coupling coefficient  @xcite , its strength essentially relies on atomic number of @xmath3 .",
    "distinctively , the layer - confinement effect in the 3r stacking is a quantum interference effect caused by the symmetry of the crystal and therefore is guaranteed to be relevant in general @xmath2 systems with the same structure .",
    "the complete confinement of the 3r valley states should also provide us with an arena of exploring novel interplay of low dimensionality and valley - physics .",
    "compared to the 2h or monolayer mos@xmath1 , the 3r polytype has a significant merit that valley polarized carriers are more robust in the latter form .",
    "the carriers are protected from relaxation processes resulting from interlayer transitions , contrary to the 2h systems . in the previous work  @xcite , we have found an indication that interlayer transitions are much suppressed and the valley excitons have much longer lifetime in 3r - mos@xmath1 .",
    "now we have clarified that the interlayer hopping amplitude is _ exactly _ zero and thus the protection is robust ; also , it is common to all 3r-@xmath2 . note that the 2d states in the 3r systems are different from those in the monolayer systems . in the former , the thickness of the sample allows us to generate valley polarized carriers away from the substrate , which will reduce impacts of the substrate potential .",
    "hence , for example , we can use the 3r crystals as a medium ( or lead wires , e.g. ) for the valley device , through which the valley - polarized carriers are robustly transmitted .",
    "the unique property of the 3r stacking could thus bring about more effective valley - information transmission and generation toward dissipation - less low - energy optoelectronic devices .",
    "to summarize , we showed rigorous absence of the interlayer hopping for the valley electrons in 3r - mos@xmath1 , which was substantiated with a group theoretical argument . through the measurement of the reflectivity spectra and analysis with an anisotropic hydrogen atom model",
    ", the absence of the hopping has been shown to make the exciton absorption spectrum 2d hydrogen - like and the exciton wave function confined in a single layer .",
    "our results exemplify the control of spatial dimensionality of the valley excitations in 2h- and 3r-@xmath2 , which may help to develop new valleytronics devices .",

    "<S> according to our first - principles band structure calculations , the valley states have no interlayer hopping in 3r - mos@xmath1 , which is proved to be the consequence of the rotational symmetry of the bloch functions . by measuring the reflectivity spectra and analyzing an anisotropic hydrogen atom model </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm that the valley excitons in 3r - mos@xmath1 have two - dimensional hydrogen - like spectral series , and the spreads of the wave function are smaller than the interlayer distance . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the valley excitons in 2h - mos@xmath1 are well described by the three - dimensional model and thus not confined in a single layer . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the dimensionality of the valley degree of freedom can be controlled simply by the stacking geometry , which can be utilized in future valleytronics . </S>"
