    "loop quantum gravity @xcite is a background independent approach to the quantization of gravity . as such ,",
    "it is based on a ( kinematical ) vacuum , the ashtekar ",
    "lewandowski vacuum @xcite , which can be seen as fundamental since it is peaked on the totally degenerate spatial geometry and has maximal uncertainty in the conjugated variable .",
    "this makes however the extraction of large scale physics quite difficult , as one has first to build up a `` condensate '' state that describes a smooth geometry at larger scales .",
    "alternative vacua , which include non  degenerate geometries and have similar peakedness properties to the ashtekar ",
    "lewandowski vacuum , have been defined in @xcite . due to the introduction of a specific spatial metric",
    "on which the non  degenerate geometries are peaked , these states are not diffeomorphism  invariant anymore ( see however @xcite for attempts to define diffeomorphism invariance ) . here we sketch the construction of a vacuum state that is dual to the ashtekar ",
    "lewandowski vacuum and carries a notion of spatial and space  time diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "since this vacuum is based on bf theory , which underlies the spin foam approach , we hope that it will more directly connect loop quantum gravity to spin foam quantization @xcite , and moreover facilitate the derivation of large scale physics .",
    "the ashtekar  lewandowski ( al ) vacuum is central for the definition of the continuum hilbert space of loop quantum gravity ( lqg hereafter ) , which arises from a refinement ( inductive ) limit of a family of hilbert spaces based on graphs .",
    "the al vacuum is ( @xmath2 ) a diffeomorphism  invariant state which is peaked on a spatial geometry that is totally degenerate and has maximal uncertainty in the conjugated holonomy variables .",
    "the vacuum also determines the ( @xmath3 ) embedding of states based on a given graph into a hilbert space based on arbitrarily refined graphs .",
    "indeed , the additional degrees of freedom on the refined graph are put into the vacuum state .",
    "furthermore ( @xmath4 ) the vacuum is cyclic , which means that the lqg hilbert space is spanned by states generated from the vacuum by ( cylindrically consistent ) observables , in this case holonomy observables .",
    "this vacuum is often called kinematical since one expects that physical states satisfying the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints will be based on a physical vacuum describing rather a non  degenerate vacuum .",
    "the quest for other vacuum states @xcite has led to the f  lost @xcite uniqueness theorem for lqg , that states that the al vacuum is unique given a certain number of assumptions .",
    "in particular , one requires a representation of the so  called holonomy  flux algebra of lqg together with the diffeomorphism invariance of the vacuum .",
    "alternatively , one might ask for a vacuum which already incorporates the dynamics of the system .",
    "indeed , the vacuum proposed in the present work is motivated by considerations in @xcite , where a construction principle for the physical vacuum is provided .",
    "as is also pointed out there , the notion of refining needed for the definition of the continuum limit should incorporate this physical vacuum . in particular , @xcite suggests to use pachner moves @xcite , which also implement the dynamics of the system @xcite , for refining the state .",
    "we will see that this idea will indeed turn out to be essential .",
    "a further motivation is the notion of duality . while the al vacuum is peaked on fluxes and has maximal uncertainty in the holonomies , the new ( bf ) vacuum which we introduce is peaked on flat holonomies and will have maximal uncertainty in certain flux observables .",
    "a description and interpretation of the classical phase space for lqg , based on using the constraints of bf theory as gauge fixings , has been given in @xcite ( see also the related discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "the notion of duality leads also to a flux representation of lqg @xcite , which is dual to the more common holonomy representation .",
    "indeed , it was pointed out in @xcite that in order to construct a flux representation in complete analogy with the holonomy representation , one needs to replace the al vacuum by a `` dual '' bf vacuum",
    ".    the setup in this work will be a simplicial version of lqg ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is needed in order to implement pachner moves as refinement . to make the notion of a bf vacuum for lqg concrete",
    ", we have to ( @xmath2 ) define the vacuum state , and ( @xmath3 ) define a notion of refinement . for point ( @xmath4 )",
    ", we first have to specify a cylindrically consistent observable algebra ( i.e. one that is consistent with the notion ( @xmath3 ) of refinement ) .",
    "this latter will be different from the standard holonomy  flux algebra of lqg , which allows us to evade the uniqueness theorems .",
    "we will then show that the hilbert space of gauge  invariant functions can be generated from the new vacuum by ( exponentiated ) flux observables .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to @xmath0dimensional gravity , for which the bf state is indeed the physical vacuum , and hence implement the ideas of @xcite .",
    "the extension to the @xmath1dimensional case is developed in @xcite .",
    "here we sketch the set  up of our construction . we consider a two  dimensional orientable smooth manifold , together with an atlas of coordinate charts and an auxiliary metric . to this manifold , we associate a set of embedded triangulations @xmath5 , their dual triangulations @xmath6 , and denote by @xmath7 the one  skeleton of @xmath6 .",
    "each dual triangulation consists of ( three  valent ) vertices @xmath8 , oriented edges @xmath9 , and faces . by embedded , we simply mean that the vertices carry coordinates .",
    "we assume that the edges of the triangulation ( which we will denote by @xmath10 ) are geodesics with respect to the auxiliary metric . to this end",
    "we also assume that the triangulation is sufficiently fine in order to ensure that the geodesics are well  defined .",
    "we endow the set of triangulations with a partial order denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "a ( dual ) triangulation @xmath12 is said to be finer than a ( dual ) triangulation @xmath6 if @xmath12 can be obtained from @xmath6 by 13 and 22 pachner moves @xcite , as shown for example on figure [ fig : refined ] .",
    "for the 13 move , one needs to specify in addition a set coordinates for the new node of the triangulation .",
    "we will see that freedom in this choice is essential for realizing a notion of spatial diffeomorphism invariance with respect to the embedding .",
    "two triangulations @xmath6 and @xmath12 can be compared if they have a common refinement @xmath13 .",
    "an example is depicted in figure [ fig : refined ] , showing that two triangulations obtained via a 13 move , but each with a different placement of the new vertex , have a common refinement .     of the triangulations on the top and on the bottom .",
    "]    concerning the group ",
    "theoretic data , we associate to each edge a space @xmath14 of functions over the group @xmath15 . the topology of this space will be specified later on .",
    "the group @xmath15 in question can be finite or a compact semi ",
    "simple lie group , and either abelian or non  abelian .",
    "the notion of refinement that we are going to use is based on pachner moves .",
    "pachner moves for triangulated two - dimensional surfaces consist of the so  called 13 , 31 , and 22 moves , and two such triangulated surfaces are pl  homeomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by a finite number of these moves .",
    "since here we are interested in refining operations , we will consider only the 13 as well as the 22 pachner moves ( i.e. discard the 31 moves ) .",
    "this is sufficient to ensure that topologically equivalent triangulations have common refinements .",
    "the notion of geometric triangulations includes embedding information for the vertices , and at least for the planar case it follows from @xcite that any two such triangulations have a common refinement .",
    "our task is to find the observables that are cylindrically consistent , i.e. commuting with the refinement operations .",
    "we will first focus on closed holonomies and then on the integrated simplicial fluxes .",
    "the cylindrical consistency of closed holonomies follows from the definition of the refining pachner moves in the holonomy representation , which we are now going to present .    in the holonomy representation",
    ", the action of the pachner moves can directly be deduced from the geometrical interpretation of bf theory as describing flat connections .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the holonomy along a ( closed ) path @xmath17 .",
    "gluing a tetrahedron to the surface might locally change this path to @xmath18 . however , since this amounts to adding only pieces of flat holonomies , the deformation of the path will not change the holonomy , and one can write that @xmath19 .",
    "this requirement determines the action of the pachner moves uniquely . from this",
    "it will follow that closed holonomy observables are cylindrically consistent , i.e. commuting with the action of refining pachner moves .

    "to @xmath25 under the action of a 13 move .",
    "notice the reversal of the edges , which is due to the fact that the 13 move glues a tetrahedron onto a triangle , so that one actually replaces oppositely oriented half  edges in the dual .",
    "the path @xmath17 is changed to @xmath18 . ]",
    "we now require that the holonomies stay the same , i.e. that @xmath19 , where @xmath17 is a path in @xmath7 , and @xmath18 the path in @xmath25 that goes along the new edges but stays in the same face . to this end",
    ", we have to define @xmath18 as a function of the path @xmath17 .",
    "we choose the rule that @xmath18 goes through the same vertices and in the same order as @xmath17 . since the 13 move replaces the vertex @xmath20 with three new vertices , the passage through @xmath20 can be replaced by any combination of paths through the three new vertices .",
    "therefore , for the holonomies to stay the same , we need the following replacement rules ( we use a counter  clockwise orientation of the faces ) : [ holo1 ] & g^-1_3g^_1g^_3g^-1_6g^-1_1,g^-1_1g^-1_2g^_1g^_4g^_2 , & + & g^_2g^_3g^-1_2g^_5g^-1_3. & this implies that the holonomy around the new face is trivial , i.e. @xmath29 . implementing the conditions @xmath19 given by the replacements with delta functions , we can define the wave function @xmath30 after the move to be [ holo2 ] & & (g^_1, ",

    "these properties and definitions can be generalized to other ( lie ) groups , such as @xmath68 @xcite .",

    "the individual fluxes have to be transported ( with the adjoint action ) to a common reference point , which we define as the source @xmath77 of the path @xmath78 ( i.e. the source of the first edge of @xmath78 ) .",

    "the definition reduces simply to the sum of the fluxes , without the adjoint action .",
    "this integrated flux observable corresponds geometrically to the displacement vector between the nodes @xmath80 and @xmath81 of the triangulation . under the action of a gauge transformation",
    ", it transforms by the adjoint action of the group in the frame in which the individual fluxes are transported , i.e. the source vertex @xmath77 .",
    "the composition of these flux observables is defined in the standard way as follows .",

    "transporting the fluxes in the same frame in order to add them , we have the composition rule _ _",
    "2^*__1^*=__1^*+h__1 ^ -1__2^*h__1^ , where @xmath87 is the holonomy from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the ribbon picture @xcite , which simultaneously represents the graph @xmath7 and its dual @xmath75 as depicted in figure [ fig : ribbon ] .",
    "a ribbon can be assigned holonomy and flux data with the composition rule @xmath90 .",
    "ribbons can then be composed following a path @xmath74 .",
    "this defines the integrated fluxes through ( g_2,x_2 ^ -1)(g_1,x_1)=(g_2g_1,_^*=x_1+g_1 ^ -1x_2 ^ -1g_1^ ) , which is a semi  direct product structure .",

    "a path defining an integrated flux @xmath73 is represented with thick lines . ]    finally , one can use the fact that the poisson bracket between the simplicial fluxes and the holonomies reproduce the poisson structure on @xmath91 to derive the poisson action of the integrated flux on a function @xmath92 . if @xmath93 , this action is vanishing .",
    "if @xmath94 , it is given by \\{_,(g_e)}=(^i)(g_e ) .",
    "since the pachner moves that we are considering are only refinement moves , they can not remove the reference frame @xmath77 of an integrated flux observable .",
    "these flux observables are cylindrically consistent . indeed",
    ", one can understand heuristically that the pachner moves add only pieces of flat geometry , for which the gauss constraints are satisfied .",
    "thus the vector associated to the path @xmath74 does not change under a pachner move .    in order to show this explicitly",
    ", we have once again to specify the replacement rules and argue that the observables commute with the pachner moves .    for the 13 pachner move ,",
    "the invariance of the integrated fluxes is immediate since the edges @xmath10 of the triangulation defining the path @xmath74 can not be affected by the move .",
    "however , in order to show this explicitly , one has to keep track of the new holonomies that are introduced by the 13 move .",
    "our replacement rule is such that the new path in the ribbon graph after the 13 move has to start from the same source @xmath77 , end at the same terminal point @xmath95 , go along the same flux variables ( or their inverse ) , and transport these fluxes using the new holonomies .    concerning the 22 move ,",
    "if the path @xmath74 does not go along the internal edge of the triangulation that is being flipped by the move , the invariance of the integrated flux follows from the same reasoning as in the 13 case discussed above .",
    "if the path ( or a portion of it ) corresponds to the edge that is being flipped , one has to use the replacement rule depicted on figure [ fig:2 - 2flux ] .",
    "this replacement rule is unique as long as one follows the arrows of the ribbon representation",
    ".    finally , let us conclude with an important remark concerning the reference frame to which the individual fluxes are transported .",
    "it can happen that this reference frame coincides with a vertex of @xmath7 that is moved by the 13 or 22 move .",
    "this is illustrated for example on figure [ fig:1 - 3 ] , where the vertex @xmath20 is replaced by the three vertices @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , if the reference frame of the path defining @xmath73 coincides with the vertex @xmath20 , there is an ambiguity in the choice of placement of the reference frame after the pachner move . while this is not problematic for the holonomy observables because of their gauge invariance , it affects the integrated fluxes since they are gauge  covariant . since the construction of the measure in the next section will involve a choice of a maximal tree with root @xmath40 , we can choose to define the integrated fluxes transported to the root .",
    "we discussed how the root behaves under pachner moves in section 3 .",
    "gauge  invariant observables can be easily obtained by taking the lie algebra trace over two integrated fluxes transported to a common reference frame , or by group averaging combinations of exponentiated fluxes as in the next section .",
    "details on the poisson algebra of these fluxes and holonomies will be discussed in @xcite .",
    "the al measure can be characterized by the evaluations of the positive linear functional @xmath96 on a spin network basis , which itself can be generated by the application of holonomy observables @xmath97 to the al vacuum state @xmath98 .",
    "the holonomies @xmath97 , with @xmath99 denoting the set of representations labeling the edges , are multiplication operators and lead to the spin network basis .",
    "more precisely , the functional @xmath96 is defined on this basis as @xmath100 , which is non  vanishing if and only if all representation labels are trivial .    to construct the new measure we will proceed similarly , but however dualizing every ingredient . instead of a constant function in the holonomy representation ,",
    "we consider a constant function in the flux representation .",
    "furthermore , the spin network basis generated by holonomies is replaced by a dual basis , which is generated by exponentiated ( integrated ) flux observables .",
    "all this is easier to consider with a choice of gauge fixing .",
    "we will also consider for now a fixed triangulation and its dual triangulation .",
    "a gauge fixing can be introduced by choosing a maximal tree @xmath101 in @xmath7 with root @xmath40 .",

    "one correspondence with the fundamental cycles of @xmath7 .",

    "another possibility is to formally define @xmath122 to be @xmath124 if @xmath125 and to be vanishing otherwise . for @xmath126 ,",
    "this leads to a bohr compactification of the dual @xmath127 to @xmath128 @xcite , which turns the vacuum into a normalizable state .    to prove the above statement",
    ", we compute the @xmath123 inner product between two states @xmath113 and @xmath129 which via the functional is given by @xmath130 : & &  r_\\{h _ } _",
    "d^|e|g_e + & = &  _",
    "(g_ )  d^|l|g _ + & = & _ ( h^-1_h_),where we applied the gauge fixing to go from the first to the second line , and @xmath131 denotes the number of leaves .",
    "thus , if the @xmath122 are chosen to be the group delta functions , the inner product defined via the functional coincides on a fixed graph with the inner product defined via the haar measure .",
    "+    [ [ nonabelian - groups . ] ] * non  abelian groups . * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the case for non  abelian groups works in a similar way . however , in contrast to the abelian case , the space of gauge  invariant functions is not parametrized by @xmath132 but by @xmath133 , where @xmath134 denotes the remaining action of the gauge group at the root @xmath40 on the space of gauge  fixed functions .",
    "we now have shift operators @xmath135 which with the bf vacuum defined as before lead to basis states _ \\{h_}:=r_\\{_t_(h _ ) } _ that are gauge  variant at the root @xmath40 .",
    "this can be cured by a group averaging , leading to gauge  invariant states ( _ \\{h_}):=r_\\ { _ t_u(h _ ) } _  du , where @xmath136 is the group averaging parameter .    to reproduce the inner product of @xmath137",
    ", we have to define the product between two such states to be ( _ \\{h_}),(_\\{h_}):=_(h^-1_uh_u^-1 )  du . a measure leading to this inner product , i.e. satisfying @xmath138",
    "is given by [ measureb ] _",
    "( ( _ \\{h_}))=_(h _ ) .    as with the abelian groups",
    ", one could also consider some compactification of the dual of @xmath15 , or rather of the dual of the maximal torus of @xmath15 .",
    "we leave this question for future explorations .",
    "this construction of the measure is independent of the choice of tree as long as the delta functions on the right hand side of and are with respect to group translation invariant measures .",
    "so far we discussed the inner product on a fixed triangulation . to compare two states on two different triangulations , we need to consider a common refinement of these triangulations .",
    "to this end , the measure or inner product has to be cylindrically consistent , so that it does not depend on the precise choice of common refinement .",
    "this is the case here since the construction of the inner product only involves cylindrically consistent observables .",
    "thus , one can expect independence of the choice of refinement .",
    "however , if we choose in and the group delta functions on the right hand side , we see that 13 moves will lead to additional factors of @xmath139 for the measure and the inner product . to cure these divergencies for the inner product we can choose a ( heat kernel ) regularization for the delta functions , and",
    "divide the inner product of two states by the norm of a reference state ( in this case the bf vacuum ) .",
    "that is , we define a modified inner product as ( see also @xcite ) _ 1,_2=_0 , where @xmath140 indicates the regulator .",
    "let us also mention a notion of spatial diffeomorphism invariance for the vacuum .",
    "consider a triangle subdivided by a 13 move but with the inner vertex placed at two different positions leading to two states @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "figure [ fig : refined ] shows that there exists a common refinement and indeed the two different ways to obtain this refinement starting with the triangle via @xmath141 and @xmath142 lead to the same state .",
    "thus the inner product identifies the two states which differ by a vertex translation .",
    "this nicely reflects the notion of vertex translations as a diffeomorphism symmetry @xcite ( see also @xcite for a similar mechanism for the physical inner product of @xmath0 gravity ) .",
    "the al projective limit construction @xcite leads to the notion of a configuration space @xmath143 as an ( quantum ) extension of the space of connections .",
    "similarly we expect that the present construction will lead to an ( quantum ) extension @xmath144 of the space of fluxes .",
    "this has been attempted in @xcite with the help of the non  commutative flux representation @xcite , however still using the standard lqg embedding .",
    "this work showed that in this case one rather encounters an inductive instead of a projective limit for the space of fluxes .",
    "this is intimately related to how holonomies and fluxes behave under the various refinement maps .",
    "the standard lqg embeddings lead to a composition of holonomies , whereas the condition on the fluxes are that these stay constant @xcite .",
    "the new bf embedding map composes fluxes , corresponding to the definition of integrated flux observables . on the other hand holonomies",
    "are refined so that curvature is left invariant .",
    "thus the bf embedding leads to a picture where fluxes are coarse grained geometrically and could hence be useful for developing geometric coarse graining and renormalization procedures related to the methods of @xcite .",
    "we sketched the construction of an alternative vacuum for loop quantum gravity , which is dual to the standard ashtekar ",
    "lewandowski vacuum .",
    "since this bf vacuum incorporates also non  degenerate geometries , we expect that it will facilitate very much the extraction of large scale physics from loop quantum gravity , and develop further its applications to cosmology .",
    "future work will make many notions more precise and provide also the construction for the @xmath1dimensional case . in this case",
    "one will have to use 14 and 23 refining pachner moves .",
    "the cylindrically consistent observables will be again closed holonomies and integrated fluxes transported to a root .",
    "these integrated fluxes will however describe the addition of normals belonging to pieces of a surface , thereby implementing a geometric composition of surfaces related to a 2category structure @xcite .",
    "our construction requires the modification of certain ingredients of loop quantum gravity , in particular the introduction of triangulations as opposed to just one  complexes ( graphs ) .",
    "this necessity was also discussed in @xcite in the context of a path integral quantization of bf theory .",
    "although we expect important changes in the standard framework of quantum gravity with the adaptation of this new vacuum , many central results remain the same , notably the discreteness casimir , that are disfavored by the al cylindrical consistency , might now be allowed by bf cylindrical consistency .",
    "] of the spectra of geometric operators @xcite . to study this more carefully",
    ", one needs the ( integrated ) fluxes themselves as operators . choosing a ( bohr ) compactification for the dual will however only allow to use the exponentiated fluxes as operators .",
    "the new representation presented here is unitarily inequivalent to the al representation .",
    "one might wonder how this new representation evades the conclusion of the f  lost uniqueness theorem @xcite , stating that the al representation is the only representation of the holonomy flux algebra , satisfying a number of conditions . as mentioned",
    "one point is that the holonomy flux algebra is changed . in particular",
    ", it is essential to use `` simplicial '' fluxes , which also incorporate the parallel transport .",
    "a precise definition of the observable algebra underlying the new representation is presented in @xcite .",
    "additionally the new representation only allows exponentiated fluxes , which will not lead to weakly continuous families .",
    "in fact in the case of the @xmath128 structure group we encounter the bohr compactification of the dual @xmath145 of @xmath128 .",
    "this requires the exponentiation of the fluxes , as is known from loop quantum cosmology @xcite in the case of operators encoding the holonomy ( and allows to evade the stone- von neumann uniqueness theorem for quantum mechanics ) . on a more heuristic level",
    ", the fact that the vacuum state is given by group delta functions forbids the action of fluxes as derivative operators and requires exponential fluxes that translate the arguments of the delta functions , as described above .",
    "we can envisage many generalizations .",
    "this framework might facilitate for example the construction of a hilbert space based on non  compact groups ( which is required for lorentzian signature in three dimensions and for the self - dual lorentzian theory in four dimensions ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , the al cylindrical consistency requires amenable groups , which is not the case for @xmath146 .",
    "furthermore , similar to the construction of koslowski , which shifts the expectation value of the fluxes , we can try to obtain a vacuum peaked on homogeneous instead of flat connections .",
    "this opens applications to loop quantum cosmology @xcite , including that of a possibly time varying homogeneous connection , but also relates to the question of whether one can derive a quantum group structure for loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "quantum groups with deformation parameter at the root of unity have in a certain sense a compact dual corresponding to an exponentiated flux observable ( for the torus subgroup ) .",
    "finally , let us comment on possible definitions of hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the refinement by pachner moves does indeed suggest an implementation of the dynamics via pachner moves , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this would nicely connect to the covariant spin foam picture @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , also an infinitesimal implementation of the dynamics via hamiltonian constraints seems to be possible .",
    "the construction of thiemann @xcite based on the al vacuum is said to lead to a finite result since the hamiltonian acts only on ( dual ) nodes where volume is concentrated .",
    "a similar mechanism can be expected for the bf vacuum , where the hamiltonian will only act on triangulation vertices ( or edges in four dimensions ) , where curvature is concentrated ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this addresses a criticism of immirzi @xcite towards the lqg hamiltonian , and corresponds more directly to diffeomorphisms as vertex translations , as it is implemented without ( discretization ) anomalies ( at least at the level of classical discretizations ) for various flat and homogeneous geometries @xcite ( see @xcite for the quantization )",
    ".    the question of the constraint algebra will however remain open for cases with propagating degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "anomalies resulting from discretization artifacts can be avoided with an exact or perfect discretization , leading to a possibly non  local hamiltonian @xcite ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , a renormalization procedure might lead to a restoration of diffeomorphism symmetry in the continuum limit @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the work presented here realizes for @xmath0dimensional gravity the construction of a continuum limit of loop quantum gravity ( and spin foam quantization ) via dynamical cylindrical consistency , which has been outlined in @xcite .",
    "thus , we can hope that such a construction leading to a physical vacuum is applicable for @xmath1dimensional gravity as well .",
