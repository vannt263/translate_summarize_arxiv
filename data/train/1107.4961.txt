    "the red rectangle ( rr ) , an enigmatic protoplanetary nebula , reveals itself to be a complex astrophysical system .",
    "the central source of the nebula , hd  44179 , is a binary system in a short - lived evolutionary phase between the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and the planetary nebula stage of its life , when the expelled circumstellar matter is ionized by the photometric primary star s hot core @xcite .",
    "the dominant features of the nebula s form are the @xmath1-shaped biconical outflows ( nearly 2 on the sky @xcite ) that emerge from a disc ( roughly 0.1 on the sky ) , seen nearly edge - on .",
    "we will refer to this optically - thick disc , resolved by _ hst _ @xcite and ground - based interferometric observations @xcite , as the circumbinary disc .",
    "the dimensions assumed for the circumbinary disc are based on a distance of 710  pc @xcite . while the distance is uncertain , we adopt this value in our investigation .",
    "@xcite traced the outer radius of the circumbinary disc to 1,850  au .",
    "the radius of the central cavity in the circumbinary disc is obtained from a scattered light model to be 14  au @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the circumbinary disc has been determined to be between 90  au @xcite and 107  au @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that values of the viewing angle vary from @xmath2 0@xmath3 to 11@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these viewing angles would correspond to inclination angles between @xmath2 90@xmath3 to 79@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite find that an intermediate value of 5@xmath3 fits their data best , which would correspond to an inclination angle of 85@xmath3 .",
    "at the centre of the cavity in the circumbinary disc are the components of the binary system : the photometric primary ( a mass - losing post - agb star ) , and the secondary ( a main sequence star with an accretion disc and high - velocity jet ) . for simplicity we shall refer to the photometric primary as the primary star throughout this paper .",
    "the primary star has an effective temperature of 7,700  k , an estimated mass of 0.8  m@xmath4 , a luminosity of about 6,000  l@xmath4 @xcite , and a radius of 0.21  au @xcite .",
    "the secondary has a mass of roughly 0.9  m@xmath4 and is believed to be a main sequence star @xcite . in the work of @xcite the dependence of the h@xmath5 line on orbital phase was investigated , revealing a high velocity jet ( @xmath6  km  s@xmath7 ) originating from an accretion disc around the secondary .",
    "the accretion disc around the secondary is powered by mass transfer from the primary star via roche - lobe overflow at periastron @xcite .",
    "the ionizing photons from the hot inner regions of the accretion disc provide the necessary energy to excite the extended red emission ( ere ) .",
    "the ere requires far - ultraviolet photons with energies e @xmath8 10.5 ev @xcite .",
    "the accretion disc also provides the energy source to maintain the hii region inside the cavity of the optically - thick circumbinary disc that was suggested by @xcite .",
    "the near edge - on optically - thick circumbinary disc prevents a direct line - of - sight view of the binary .",
    "light originating inside the cavity can only be observed via scattering off material located above and below the disc .",
    "this obscured view of the binary , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , will be referred to as the indirect line - of - sight and is responsible for the difficult interpretation of the spectra .",
    "the indirect line - of - sight to the central object was first studied by @xcite , who determined the effective inclination angle to be 35@xmath3 .",
    "the effective inclination angle is the angle at which light from the central binary is scattered into our line - of - sight by the material near the top and bottom of the disc .",
    "this viewing geometry has been confirmed by high - resolution optical @xcite and infrared imaging @xcite .",
    "for light from the central source ( which can only been seen via scattering ) , we adopt the effective inclination angle of 35@xmath3 in our calculations .",
    "the outer regions of the nebula are , however , seen directly . to properly study emission processes that originate in the outer nebula one must use the inclination angle of the nebula ( 85@xmath3 ) rather than the effective inclination angle ( 35@xmath3 ) .    since hd  44179 can only be studied via scattered light , it is important to discuss the known uncertainties .",
    "the effective angle at which we are viewing the stars is likely the mean scattering angle .",
    "the variation of the scattering angle over the duration of the orbit , which best fits the 0.14  mag variation in the light curve , is 1.6@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the average value for the scattering angle corresponds to the effective inclination angle of 35@xmath3 . in addition",
    ", the tilt of the system implies that the scattering angle for light from the north and the south of the nebula is slightly different ( of order 5@xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore , the effective inclination angle is just that , an effective value that we use in order to make progress in understanding this complex system . the variation in the value for the effective inclination angle will cause uncertainties in ; the orbital elements , the derived velocities , and the mass of the secondary",
    ".    the properties of the stars also depend upon the estimation of the luminosity @xcite .",
    "the luminosity depends on the uncertain distance to the star , assumptions about the geometry of the circumbinary - disc , and the evolutionary state of the system .",
    "since this a close binary , it is likely that there has been some interaction in the past resulting in a complex evolutionary history .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the evolutionary track of the stars differ from that of single stars , as in @xcite and @xcite . as a result , the quoted values that we have used for the mass and luminosity of the primary remain uncertain . at present",
    ", these uncertainties can not be addressed with current observational data .",
    "studying the nebular outflow and its mechanisms is important for understanding how stellar material is returned to the interstellar medium .",
    "the detectable emission of the h@xmath5 recombination line in our spectra is limited to the inner parts of the nebula .",
    "the h@xmath5 emission is not observed in the bi - conical lobes far away from the central source .",
    "studying the nai  d - lines , easily excited resonance lines , allows us to probe the mass - loss to much greater distances from the central source .",

    "the model lines do not include any broadening mechanisms other than thermal and pressure broadening .",
    "significant rotation is not expected for a giant star .",
    "while it is possible the star is rotating , rotation can not explain the orbital phase - dependent asymmetry of the lines , as rotational broadening is symmetric .",
    "macroturbulence is known to produce lines with symmetric cores and asymmetric wings that conserve equivalent width ; however , the required macroturbulent velocity would need to be roughly 23  km  s@xmath7 , which would be very supersonic for this star s atmosphere .",
    "the isothermal sound speed is approximately 8  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "macroturbulence alone can not explain the dependence of the asymmetry on the orbital period .",
    "it also does not explain the extent of the wing either 40  km  s@xmath7 blue- or red - shifted depending on the orbital phase .",
    "the primary star is only observable via the indirect line - of - sight .",
    "the location and nature of the scattering material is uncertain . if the material from which the light is scattered has some intrinsic velocity dispersion , then the observed line profile will be broadened as it scatters off this material .",
    "the scattering from the north and south of the nebula likely occur at slightly different scattering angles due to the tilt of the nebula with respect to the line - of - sight .",
    "however , the scattering from each end of the nebula likely occurs over a range of angles of order 5@xmath3 .",
    "the fact that the binary stars are in motion around the centre - of - mass implies that the mean scattering angle with change slightly over the course of the orbit . in order to properly explore the scattering in the rr , a 3-d monte carlo model is planned to further study this system .",
    "a double - lined spectroscopic binary could produce the line asymmetries we observe .",
    "the weaker component would be due to the companion star , while the stronger component would be due to the primary star .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the weaker component is due to absorption in the atmosphere of the companion star for the following reasons .",
    "the companion star is a 0.9  m@xmath4 main sequence dwarf @xcite .",
    "this implies that its luminosity is of order l@xmath4 , while the primary star has a luminosity of order 6,000  l@xmath4 .",
    "the ratio of the luminosities would mean an extremely weak contribution to the line from the secondary , while the observed contribution of the weaker component to the line is between 1/3 and 1/2 of the flux of the strong component .",
    "it is also unlikely that the weak component can be attributed to absorption in the accretion disc around the secondary .",
    "while the accretion disc has a luminosity around 300  l@xmath4 , the contribution would still be smaller than 1/3 of the strong component . in addition",
    ", the maximum effective temperature of the disc is about 23,000  k @xcite , and one would not expect atmospheric lines from the disc to have the same ionization balance as the atmosphere of the primary , which has an effective temperature of 7,700 k. yet , observations of various photospheric absorption lines at different ionization states and species all exhibit the same asymmetric profiles .",
    "pulsations in the atmospheres of r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars show a second absorption - line component that is shifted toward either longer or shorter wavelengths of the centre of the photospheric absorption line , producing a variable asymmetric absorption - line profile @xcite .",
    "these asymmetric profiles are reminiscent of the observed absorption - line profiles observed in hd  44179 .",
    "however , hd  44179 is not an rcb star .",
    "the brightness of rcb stars can decrease by nearly 8  mag at unpredictable intervals .",

    "attribute the line doubling observed in rcb stars to shocks in their atmospheres .",
    "such atmospheric shocks are not limited to rcb stars , similar line splitting is also seen in rv tauri stars .",
    "line splitting is also observed in other stars with loosely bound atmospheres .",
    "complex atmospheric motions are seen in other f - type post - agb stars , for example sao  96709 @xcite .",
    "we interpret the asymmetric wings as motion in the atmosphere of hd  44179 .",
    "material in the atmosphere is systematically flowing toward the primary during some phases of the orbit and away from the primary during other phases .",
    "when the primary moves through the phase of periastron , the asymmetry is always on the blue side of the line core .",
    "the asymmetry is on the red side of the line core , when the primary is moving through the phase of apastron , compare fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and fig .",
    "there is no discernible asymmetry at the conjunctions .",
    "the direction of flow , relative to the primary , appears to be affected by the varying size of the roche lobe , see panel a of fig .",

    "the roche lobe radius of the primary at periastron is 0.34  au .",
    "the binary components separation at periastron is 0.91  au . at apastron",
    "the stars are separated by 1.8  au and the roche radius of the primary is 0.66  au . while the model atmosphere radius of the star does not exceed the roche lobe radius , it should be noted that radiation pressure can significantly reduce the size of the _ effective _ roche lobe @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the radiation pressure effect becomes stronger as a giant star s effective temperature increases .",
    "the authors only compute models for t@xmath26 5,000  k , but hd  44179 has a higher t@xmath27 .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the effective roche lobe radius is decreased by this effect .",
    "the size of the roche lobe can also be positively or negatively affected by the rotation rate of the star @xcite in the case of systems with non - synchronously rotating stars in eccentric orbits , as is the case with hd  44179 .",
    "the rotation rate of the primary star is unknown ; however , significant rotation is not expected in this system .    enhanced",
    "mass - loss occurs near periastron passage , but some of the lost material can be back - accreted onto the mass - losing star within that half the orbital period when the roche lobe reaches its largest extent , increasing its volume about eight - fold compared to its size at periastron .",
    "the self - accretion is likely caused by the expanding roche lobe @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that for systems with initial eccentricities greater than 0.2 and a mass ratio greater than 0.006 , mass overflow always leads to self - accretion .",
    "this suggests that we may be seeing the self - accretion occurring in hd  44179 . in panel",

    "[ fig10 ] we plot the derivative of the roche lobe radius with respect to time .",
    "negative slopes indicate a contracting roche lobe , while a positive slope indicates an expanding roche lobe . in panel c of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we show the velocity of the weak component of the asymmetric line , with respect to the star s surface .",
    "negative velocities indicate material moving away from the star , while positive velocities indicate material moving toward the star .      a final consideration is the uncertainty in the effective inclination angle .",
    "while it is clear that the optically thick circumbinary disc prevents a direct view of the binary , the exact path or paths though which we observe the star affect our interpretation of the system .",
    "the cartoon model presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and in other works previously cited , contains a rather thick , flat circumbinary disc .",
    "such discs have been seen for example in hr  4049 @xcite .",
    "if the disc is flared , we could likely see into the system with a much higher effective inclination angle .",
    "the detailed geometry of the inner region of the rr circumbinary disc requires a 3d model that includes resonant line scattering , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .      a specific model for how the rr produces these orbital phase - dependent photospheric lines",
    "is not needed in order to remove them from the spectra .",
    "therefore , if we utilize a mostly empirical method to remove the absorption line component from the observed nai  d - line profile , we will be left with the nebular contributions to the spectrum .",
    "using fourier analysis , we can construct a convolution kernel that will take model atmosphere lines produced by phoenix and modify them to look like the observed absorption lines in the spectra of hd  44179 . under the assumption that the model line profiles produced by phoenix have the correct shape for the underlying intrinsic photosphere , the phoenix model nai  d - line was taken as the ` true ' shape of the line .",
    "a representative photospheric absorption line is then used as a template of the line shape for a given observation . the observed ci 4932.049  served as the template line shape .",
    "the observed ci 4932.049   line was chosen because it is not contaminated by telluric features and it is unsaturated .",
    "we were unable to utilize the ir nai line due to contamination of the line by telluric features during several orbital phases .",
    "for each observation , the phoenix model ci 4932.049   line was doppler - shifted to the appropriate wavelength according to the measured strong component of the rv .",

    "the nai  d - lines are easily exited resonance lines that arise in material situated well past the inner cavity of the disc .",

    "in addition , the stis nai  d - line spectrum shows blue - shifted emission emerging only from the southern part of the rr , while the red - shifted emission only originates from the northern part , as shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the northern view shows a weak absorption component on the blue side of the red - shifted emission close to the central source but not at larger distances from the optically - thick circumbinary disc .",
    "this is consistent with outflowing material seen against the star in the inner regions of the nebula , while at larger distances it is only seen in emission .",
    "current ground - based observations of the rr lack the spatial resolution of stis , thus incorporating light from both the north and south lobes of the nebula in a single composite spectral profile .",
    "the stis nai  d - line spectrum demonstrates that the double - peaked emission profile we observe from the ground originates from the extended biconical nebula .",
    "the material in the bi - cones originates from the mass - loss driven outflow of the primary star .",
    "the same explanation may also extend to all the other double - peaked optical emission profiles reported by @xcite , but this has not been directly confirmed in the present work . the double - peaked emission clearly does not originate from material orbiting in a circumbinary disc as previously suggested by @xcite .",
    "the range in inclination angles ( 89@xmath3 to 79@xmath3 : 90@xmath3 can be safely ruled out in light of the double - peaked emission line ) leads to a range in bipolar outflow speeds from about 300 to 30  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the best - fitting value of the inclination angle from @xcite , 85@xmath3 , corresponds to about 70  km  s@xmath7 , which is of the order of the estimated escape velocity from the primary star , 83  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "if we assume that the outflow has a velocity equal to the escape speed from the surface of the star , then we can infer the inclination angle to be 86@xmath3 .",
    "therefore the value for the inclination used by @xcite would seem to fit our data best as well . the range of velocities from 30  km  s@xmath7 to 70  km  s@xmath7 , if interpreted as escape velocities , would correspond to a range in distances from the centre of the primary star of 1.6  au to 0.3  au respectively .",
    "this would seem to suggest that the blue - shifted absorption , with a maximum velocity near 50  km  s@xmath7 (   [ sec - blue - shifted - absorption ] ) , is produced by the same outflow that produces the emission lines .",
    "therefore , with the nai  d - lines we observe the mass - loss driven outflow , powered by the primary star , from inside the cavity of the optically - thick circumbinary disc out as far as 10 . inside the cavity",
    "we see the material in absorption against the primary star , while outside the cavity we directly view the material in emission .",
    "the height of the centroids of the blue - shifted and red - shifted emission peaks above the continuum for both lines in the nai  d doublet were measured as a function of phase for our model - subtracted spectra .",
    "the height of the blue - emission peak is referred to as the v - height , while the red - shifted height is called the r - height ( both are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] as a function of orbital phase ) .",
    "these quantities allow us to examine the components of the emission profile separately and they are preferable to using the equivalent width .",
    "the equivalent width could in principle be used to quantify these components . however , since the emission peaks are blended and there are absorption features on both sides of the emission peaks it complicates the interpretation of the equivalent width measurements . the equivalent width for the blue - shifted and red - shifted emission components can only be determined through deblending , which increases the uncertainty in the measurements .",
    "this is due , primarily , to the uncertainty of the underlying shape of each emission component .    .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates the orbital locations .",
    "[ fig13],width=302 ]    the outflow , as characterized by the v - height ( fig .",

    "the v / r - ratio for both the stis and mcdonald data are included in fig .  [ fig14 ] and show good agreement with the data from apo . in order to make a comparison with the apo data , the mcdonald datum was photosphere - subtracted and artificially degraded to match the resolution of the apo data .",
    "the stis data are spatially resolved and the contribution from the stellar atmosphere should be negligible due to the choice of extraction apertures .",
    "the variability of the v / r - ratio is dominated at all phases by the blue - shifted component .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the overall phase dependence is observed to be the same , peaking near phase @xmath40 .",
    "the ratio of the flux between the d2-line ( 5890   ) and the d1-line ( 5896   ) for optically thin processes is the ratio of the oscillator strengths , which is equal to two . for optically - thick processes the ratio approaches unity .",
    "the ratio of the v - height 5890   to v - height 5896   is measured to be unity and shows no phase dependence .",
    "this implies that the emission must be optically thick .",
    "the blue absorption equivalent width ( w ) , however , does obey the optically thin limit of w@xmath42  /  w@xmath43  =  2 , which would seem to disagree with the emission ratio . in the mcdonald data the w ratio is 1.4 at its higher - resolution .",
    "when the mcdonald data were artificially degraded for comparison , the w ratio increased to 1.5 .",
    "this suggests that in the lower resolution apo data the blue - shifted emission is affecting the w ratio and that the material seen against the star is not optically thin , but not entirely optically thick .",
    "taking the mcdonald data into consideration , it seems that we are seeing the same outflow of material in the cavity that is flowing into the outer nebula .",
    "@xcite observed that the nai  d - line emission was strongest along the bi - cone walls or ` whiskers ' . at large distances from the centre of the nebula",
    "we directly see the emission , which may be dominated by emission from walls of the outflow cavity .",
    "the optical depth through the edge of outflow would be largest .",
    "these observations are consistent with the work of @xcite who found that the sodium emission was optically thin on either side of the ` whiskers ' and optically - thick on the ` whiskers ' .    similarly , the ratio of red - shifted emission height r - height 5890   to r - height 5896   is also constant with phase ; however , the ratio is about 0.84 .",
    "the 5896   d1-line consistently has a stronger red component than the 5890   d2-line .",
    "this remains a puzzle ; it was expected that the red - shifted emission component may be more highly scattered and thus weaker than the blue - shifted component .",
    "this effect should apply equally to both lines of the doublet .",
    "since the ratio for the blue - shifted emission is unity , implying near optically - thick emission , the expectation would be that the red emission ratio would also be unity .",
    "however , the smaller ratio of the red component is unexpected for the optically thick case .",
    "this could indicate that the photospheric subtraction technique of   [ technique ] is insufficient , but without the means to spatially separate the components at high - resolution we can not resolve the issue in this paper .    the blue - shifted emission and blue - shifted absorption in the apo spectra are seen to be strongest near phase @xmath38 0.48 ( just after periastron ) coinciding with the period of the fastest mass outflow from the primary star , based on the asymmetry of the photospheric absorption lines , see panel c of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . during these phases",
    ", mass is being added to the outflow resulting in increased absorption and emission .",
    "the close proximity in time of the strongest emission and absorption is suggestive that the outflows seen in absorption and emission are one and the same .",
    "this argument provides further support to the discussion in   [ semissioncomp ] relating the velocities of these components .",
    "note that the gas seen in nai  d absorption is significantly slower than that of h@xmath5 , seen in absorption near superior conjunction , and attributed to the jet from the secondary @xcite .",
    "this also supports the idea that the outflow seen in nai  d emission and absorption originates from the primary star , rather than from the secondary star s accretion disc jet .",
    "however , why the emission components , which extend to large distances from the central source , are correlated with the motion of the primary star is unknown .     disappears because this is a relative measurement on each spectrum .",
