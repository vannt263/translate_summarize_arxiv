    "under the modern holistic paradigm provided by _",
    "systems biology _  @xcite , genome - scale knowledge of individual components is combined with knowledge of interactions underlying the physiology of living organisms .",
    "the central goal of systems biology is to integrate all available biological data and to reconstruct _ executable models _",
    "@xcite which allow to investigate complicated behaviour emerging from the underlying biochemistry .",
    "an important dimension is the quantitative aspect of the data and processes being modeled . with respect to  @xcite",
    ", we consider biological models to be captured by the notion of a _ biochemical dynamical system _ consisting of variables describing a certain quantity of the respective species in time ( e.g. , number of molecules or molar concentration ) .",
    "variable values evolve in time with respect to rules modeling the effect of reactions .",
    "the space of all possible configurations of variable values is referred as the _ state space_.    there exist several modeling approaches that differ in abstraction employed for modeling of time , variable values , and molecular interaction effects .",
    "the most commonly used approach concerns systems of ordinary differential equations ( ode )  @xcite where both time and model variables are interpreted as continuous quantities .",
    "effects of interactions are modeled in terms of continuous deterministic updates of variables .",
    "variable values represent molar concentrations of the species . in general ,",
    "the ode approach relies on many physical and chemical assumptions simplifying thermodynamic conditions under which particular biochemical phenomena can be modeled correctly  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that even simple interactions such as second order reactions lead to non - linear odes . however , under certain assumptions , biological systems make specific subclasses of general non - linear dynamical systems . such a specialization motivated development of specific analysis techniques  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , dimensionality and complexity of biological models preclude satisfactory application of analysis methods implying that to explore the model dynamics the only practicable method is numerical simulation . since numerical simulation generates an approximate solution ( a trajectory ) starting from a single initial point in the continuous state space , the scope of such exploration is limited to the particular trajectory only .",
    "this is sufficient for `` local '' analysis provided that initial conditions are precisely known .",
    "however , studied systems are typically under - determined in terms of uncertain quantitative parameters and initial conditions",
    ". therefore generalization of the exploration scope is necessary to reveal and understand the complicated emergent behaviour .",
    "an important example of a problem which can not be effectively solved by local methods is _ global temporal property _ ",
    "the problem to decide whether a given dynamical phenomenon , e.g. , oscillation or variables correlation , is globally present / absent for all considered initial conditions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to a subclass of dynamical phenomena representing _ reachability _ of a given portion of the state space .",
    "example of a global temporal property problem that belongs to this subclass is to identify minimal or maximal concentration of species reachable from a particular set of initial conditions .",
    "in general , the reachability problem is undecidable due to unboundedness and uncountability of the state space .",
    "however , since concentrations of species can not expand infinitely , state spaces of biological systems dynamics can be considered bounded in most cases .",
    "analysis can be therefore considered indirectly on suitable finite discrete approximations of continuous state spaces  @xcite . for a significant class of biochemical dynamical systems determined by multi - affine vector fields ( i.e. , affine in each variable )",
    ", there has been developed an over - approximative abstraction technique based on partitioning the continuous state space by a finite set of _ rectangles_. rectangles determine states of a _ rectangular transition system _ representing the finite discrete ( over)approximation of the continuous state space  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : abstscheme]a .",
    "the rectangular abstraction has been employed in  @xcite for reachability analysis and further elaborated by model checking methods in  @xcite .",
    "the results show that the extent of spurious behaviour introduced by the abstraction is typically very high thus limiting satisfactory application of the method .",
    "the problem is based mainly on the fact that a transition between any two individual rectangles over - approximates the vector field on the border between the rectangles ( a so - called _ facet _ , see figure  [ fig : abstscheme]b ) provided that the information regarding which trajectories starting in an entry facet evolve through a particular exit facet is abstracted out .",
    "this causes the rectangular transition system to generate many rectangle sequences in which there is no corresponding trajectory of the original continuous system embedded .",
    "moreover , the extent of such spurious behaviour is not directly eliminated by increasing the partition density .    when analysing approximate models as in systems biology , the need for precise results critically required in systems verification can be relaxed provided that a suitable approximation of the solution can be even more efficient to obtain useful results .",
    "henceforth , in the field of complex systems exhaustive techniques are often combined with approximative methods thus making a certain shift in the way of applying formal methods  @xcite .",
    "we present a new technique for discrete approximation of biochemical systems with dynamics given by a system of odes with multi - affine right hand side .",
    "our discrete approximation is not an exact abstraction wrt the original continuous system , but rather an approximation that approaches exact reachability with decreasing approximation granularity . while still assuming the rectangular partition at the background , we employ a _ measure _ that enables local quantification of the amount of trajectories evolving on a rectangle in a particular facet - to - facet direction . to this end , every rectangle is augmented with a local memory representing the information at which part ( _ entry set _ ) of the entry facet it has been entered . on each entry set , we identify _ focal subsets _ from which all trajectories lead to the same exit facet . in figure",
    "[ fig : abstscheme]c , there are two different states of a _ quantitative discrete approximation automaton _ ( qdaa ) depicted .",
    "both states share the same rectangle @xmath0\\times[1,1.5]$ ] and they differ in entry sets ( marked yellow ) .",
    "the upper state with entry set @xmath1 $ ] has only one focal set - all trajectories from its entry set exit the state through the facet @xmath0\\times\\{1\\}$ ] .",
    "the second state with entry set @xmath0\\times\\{1.5\\}$ ] has two focal subsets made by the green and the red part of the entry facet , respectively .",
    "transitions from a state with given entry set have weights assigned to themselves . consider a transition from a state @xmath2 to a state @xmath3 .",
    "the transition exists if there is a part @xmath4 of the entry set of @xmath2 such that the trajectories of ode solutions go from @xmath4 to @xmath3 .",
    "weight of a transition from @xmath2 to @xmath3 corresponds to the ( @xmath5-dimensional ) volume of @xmath4 divided by the volume of the entry set of @xmath2 . in this manner , the measure reflects amounts of trajectories proceeding in a particular direction .",
    "rectangle regions related by weighted transitions make the qdaa which is a discrete - time markov chain .",
    "( see theorem  [ thm : mc ] and its proof . )    from a computational viewpoint , the continuous volumes are finitely approximated by discretization on a uniform grid .",
    "local numerical simulations are employed to identify the entry regions and focal subsets .",
    "the density of facet discretization grid is considered as the _ method parameter_. because of combining numerical simulation with rectangular abstraction , the resulting qdaa makes neither an over- nor an under - approximation of the original continuous system . since for every sequence of states the approximate volume measure converges to the continuous volume with increasing discretization parameter , the parameter indirectly affects the correspondence between the original continuous behaviour and its approximation .",
    "this makes the method sufficient for approximating reachability in complex biochemical dynamical systems .    in general",
    ", the following main contributions are brought by this paper .    1 .   a novel computational technique for finite discrete approximation of multi - affine dynamical systems by means of qdaa .",
    "2 .   showing that qdaa converges to the original continuous system behaviour .",
    "( see theorem  [ thm : kappa_lebesgue ] and its proof . )",
    "a reachability algorithm for qdaa .",
    "4 .   evaluation on elementary models and an _ e. coli _ case study .",
    "since the most common application of the considered systems class is the domain of biochemical dynamical systems modeled directly by rules of mass action kinetics  @xcite , evaluation of the method and algorithms is realized on biological models fitting this framework .",
    "discrete approximation methods are commonly used in continuous and hybrid systems analysis ( see  @xcite for an overview regarding reachability ) to handle the uncountability of the state space .",
    "direct methods work on the original system and rely on a successor operation iteratively computing the reachable set whereas indirect methods abstract from the continuous model by a finite structure for which the analysis is simpler .",
    "our method belongs to the latter class , since it uses numerical simulations and creates the abstraction automaton . considering a fixed set of initial conditions",
    ", there is a certain overhead with generating states of the automaton in comparison with simple numerical simulations .",
    "however , the advantage of constructing the automaton is obtaining a global view of the dynamics .",
    "moreover , in addition to rectangular abstraction , the automaton is augmented with weighted transitions which represent quantitative information describing volumes of subsets of initial conditions belonging to attraction basins of different parts of the phase space .",
    "an indirect method based on rectangular abstraction automaton making the finite quotient of the continuous state space has been employed , e.g. , in  @xcite . in general , these methods rely on results  @xcite and are applicable to ( piece - wise ) affine or ( piece - wise ) multi - affine systems .",
    "although not addressed formally in this paper , our technique can be considered as a refinement of  @xcite .",
    "however , we focus on obtaining satisfactory approximate results eliminating the extent of spurious behaviour coming from conservativeness of rectangular abstraction . our technique can be employed for the recognition of spurious behaviour of the rectangular abstraction transition system .",
    "the technique presented in  @xcite employes timed automata for the finite quotient of a continuous system as an alternative to piece - wise linear approximations .",
    "another indirect technique adapted to multi - affine biological models is  @xcite .",
    "the approach also employes rectangular abstraction , but results in less conservative reachable sets by means of polyhedral operations . in  @xcite",
    "there are techniques proposed for rectangular refinement that go towards reduction of over - conservativeness .",
    "these techniques work fine for linear systems while leaving the non - linear systems as a challenge .",
    "direct methods are mostly based on hybridization realized by partitioning the system state space into domains where the local continuous behaviour is linearized  @xcite .",
    "this method , in an improved form , has been applied to non - linear biochemical dynamical systems  @xcite . in general ,",
    "direct methods give good results for low - dimensional systems and small initial sets . in comparison with indirect approaches",
