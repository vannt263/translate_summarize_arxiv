    "@xcite have applied the multireference ccca method@xcite to compute the potential energy curves of n@xmath9 and c@xmath9 ; they obtained errors of @xmath140.06 pm for the bond lengths and @xmath142 @xmath1 for the harmonic frequencies .",
    "the determination of very precise molecular energies ( atomization energies or enthalpies of formation ) has been one of the primary goals of composite _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "it has been shown that highly accurate thermochemical protocols such as heat@xcite and w4@xcite are capable of sub - kj / mol accuracy on average ( see ref.@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "in particular , w4 theory obtains a root mean square deviation ( rmsd ) of 0.08 kcal / mol against a test set of 25 first- and second - row small molecules for which very accurate atct@xcite atomization energies are available .",
    "this implies a 95% confidence interval of @xmath140.16 kcal / mol ; the mean signed deviation ( msd ) of just -0.01 kcal / mol suggests that w4 is free of systematic bias .",

    "it is of interest to establish the reliability of w4 ( and related ) methods for spectroscopic properties based on energy derivatives with respect to the nuclear coordinates ( _ e.g. _ @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath16 ) and for electrical properties based on energy derivatives with respect to an external static electric field ( _ e.g. _ @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) .",

    "the chosen set , which includes radicals , polar systems , hydrides , and nonhydrides with single and multiple bonds , evidently spans a wide gamut from systems dominated by dynamical correlation ( e.g. bh and h@xmath9o ) to systems with pathological nondynamical correlation ( _ e.g. _ c@xmath9 , bn , beo , and o@xmath10 ) and all shades in between .",

    "the computational protocols of w4 , w4.2 , and w4.3 theories have been specified and rationalized in great detail elsewhere.@xcite in the present work the steps involved in w4 theory are divided in the following manner :    * w4[up to ccsd(t)@xmath18 represents the clamped - nuclei , non - relativistic ccsd(t ) infinite basis set limit energy in the frozen - core approximation ( in which the 1@xmath19 orbitals for first - row atoms and the 1@xmath19 , 2@xmath19 , and 2@xmath20 orbitals for second - row atoms are constrained to be doubly occupied in all configurations ) .",

    "the following extrapolations are used for the hf , ccsd , and ( t ) contributions : * * the rohf - scf contribution is extrapolated from the aug-cc - pv(5+d)z and aug-cc - pv(6+d)z basis sets using the karton - martin modification@xcite of jensen s extrapolation formula.@xcite * * the rccsd valence correlation energy is calculated from these same basis sets . following the suggestion of klopper,@xcite it is partitioned into singlet - coupled pair energies , triplet - coupled pair energies , and @xmath21 terms .",
    "the singlet - coupled and triplet - coupled pair energies are extrapolated using the @xmath22 two - point extrapolation formula ( where @xmath23 is the highest angular momentum present in the basis set ) with @xmath24=3 and @xmath25=5 , respectively , and the @xmath21 term ( which exhibits very weak basis set dependence ) is set equal to that in the largest basis set . * * the ( t ) valence correlation energy is extrapolated from the aug-cc - pv(q+d)z and aug-cc - pv(5+d)z basis sets using the @xmath26 two - point extrapolation formula . for open - shell systems",

    "<S> accurate spectroscopic constants and electrical properties of small molecules are determined by means of w4 and post - w4 theories . for a set of 28 first- and second - row diatomic molecules for which very accurate experimental spectroscopic constants are available , w4 theory affords near - spectroscopic or better predictions . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the root - mean - square deviations ( rmsd ) from experiment are 0.04 pm for the equilibrium bond distances ( @xmath0 ) , 1.03 @xmath1 for the harmonic frequencies ( @xmath2 ) , 0.20 @xmath1 for the first anharmonicity constants ( @xmath3 ) , 0.10 @xmath1 for the second anharmonicity constants ( @xmath4 ) , and 0.001 @xmath1 for the vibration - rotation coupling constants ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these rmsd imply 95% confidence intervals of about 0.1 pm for @xmath0 , 2.0 @xmath1 for @xmath2 , 0.4 @xmath1 for @xmath3 , and 0.2 @xmath1 for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that post - ccsd(t ) contributions are essential to achieve such narrow confidence intervals for @xmath0 and @xmath2 , but have little effect on @xmath3 and @xmath5 , and virtually none on @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> higher - order connected triples , @xmath6(t ) , improve agreement with experiment for the hydride systems , but their inclusion ( in the absence of @xmath7 ) tends to worsen agreement with experiment for the nonhydride systems . </S>",
    "<S> connected quadruple excitations , @xmath7 , have significant and systematic effects on @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , in particular they universally increase @xmath0 ( by up to 0.5 pm ) , universally reduce @xmath2 ( by up to 32 @xmath1 ) , and universally increase @xmath3 ( by up to 1 @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> connected quintuple excitations , @xmath8 , are spectroscopically significant for @xmath2 of the nonhydride systems , affecting @xmath2 by up to 4 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> diagonal born  </S>",
    "<S> oppenheimer corrections have systematic and spectroscopically - significant effects on @xmath0 and @xmath2 of the hydride systems , universally increasing @xmath0 by 0.010.06 pm and decreasing @xmath2 by 0.32.1 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> obtaining @xmath0 and @xmath2 of the pathologically multireference bn and beo systems with near - spectroscopic accuracy requires large basis sets in the core - valence ccsd(t ) step and augmented basis sets in the valence post - ccsd(t ) steps in w4 theory . </S>",
    "<S> the triatomic molecules h@xmath9o , co@xmath9 , and o@xmath10 are also considered . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium geometries and harmonic frequencies ( with the exception of the asymmetric stretch of o@xmath10 ) are obtained with near - spectroscopic accuracy at the w4 level . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric stretch of ozone represents a severe challenge to w4 theory , in particular the connected quadruple contribution converges very slowly with the basis set size . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the importance of post - ccsd(t ) correlation effects for electrical properties , namely dipole moments ( @xmath11 ) , polarizabilities ( @xmath12 ) , and first hyperpolarizabilities ( @xmath13 ) is evaluated . </S>"
