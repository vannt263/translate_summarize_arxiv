    "since we observe the same behavior for two very different types of junctions with substantially different parameters , we conclude that the observed direct correspondence of the induced josephson phase shift to the polar angle of the vortex can not be explained by the vortex current _",

    "therefore effects of the vortex stray field and the surface current at the junction interface are identical [ follow for example the transition from equation  ( [ adphi ] ) to equation  ( [ adphi0 ] ) ] .",
    "discussion in terms of stray field lines from the vortex closing through the junction area is perhaps more illustrative because it shows more clearly the nontrivial behavior of the trapped flux in the junction . indeed , in the classical case , i.e. , in the absence of josephson effect in the junction @xmath163 , the stray field distribution should be governed by a simple magnetostatics , which minimizes magnetic field energy outside the superconductor . in this case",
    "only a small portion of the total flux should go through the junction because field focusing in the narrow slit costs extra energy . to the contrary",
    ", we observe that a half of the flux @xmath30 is going through the junction for long enough junctions .",
    "such quantization is not expected for the magnetostatic stray field .",
    "most clearly the non - magnetostatic behavior of the trapped flux is demonstrated by the experiment with the stray field drain . as seen from fig .",
    "1c , the drain opens an additional area for returning the stray field , which is more than twenty times larger than the area of the junction slit .",
    "it is clear that this should dramatically reduce the magnetostatic flux in the junction slit .",
    "however , experimental data in fig .  3 show that this is not the case .",
    "apparently , magnetostatic stray field _",
    "alone _ can not explain the observed phenomenon .",
    "although the mechanism is still unclear , we believe that the presence of the josephson junction itself plays a crucial role in the observed remarkable coincidence of the induced josephson phase shift in the junction and the london gauge field of the vortex .",
    "certainly , vortex stray fields and surface currents are involved .",
    "however , they are modified by the system to assume certain values through the junction . in effect",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] ]    to clarify the origin of the unusual @xmath25 quantization , the junctions were modified by a focused ion beam ( fib ) in two steps , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c . </S>",
    "<S> first , a vortex trap was made in order to control the position of the vortex . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath28 junctions have attracted significant attention in recent years , both due to the interesting physics involved , and the potential for new applications . </S>",
    "<S> so far , three types of @xmath14    @xmath28 junctions were realized based on : i ) the @xmath31-wave symmetry of the order parameter in high @xmath32 superconductors@xcite , ii ) the oscillatory nature of the proximity induced order parameter in hybrid superconductor / ferromagnet junctions@xcite , and iii ) the phase shift by current injection into the junction@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate that a conventional @xmath14-junction can be switched into the @xmath14    @xmath28 state by a single abrikosov vortex , parallel to the junction plane .     patterns for the same nb / ptni / nb junction @xmath33  nm@xmath34 for two in - plane field orientations . </S>",
    "<S> first the field is swept up starting from the vortex free state until first abrikosov vortices enter the electrodes ( blue symbols ) and then back to zero ( red symbols ) . </S>",
    "<S> entrance and exit of the abrikosov vortex leads to a sudden appearance of the offset @xmath22 in the fraunhofer pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in panel  b shows the @xmath6 pattern in a wider field range . * </S>",
    "<S> * c , flux offset @xmath35 induced by the vortex as a function of the polar angle @xmath36 of the vortex within the junction . </S>",
    "<S> similar symbols correspond to the same junction with different in - plane field orientations . </S>",
    "<S> red squares correspond to the junction shown in panels  a and b. the dashed line indicates that the josephson phase shift induced by the vortex ( right axis ) is simply equal to the polar angle of the vortex . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ]    importantly , introduction of the stray field drain does not reduce the offset @xmath22 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly shows that the effective trapped flux in the junction is not driven by the simple magnetostatic spreading of the vortex stray field . to get more insight into the influence of junction geometry on @xmath22 , mesoscopic nb / ptni </S>",
    "<S> / nb junctions were used , where the vortex is geometrically confined in the middle of the electrodes@xcite , @xmath37 , @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> all junctions had the same electrode thicknesses @xmath31 , but different junction lengths @xmath39 , thus allowing variation of the ratio @xmath40 .    in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a , b we show @xmath6 for a nb / ptni / nb junction @xmath41 nm@xmath34 with an in - plane field parallel to different facets of the junction . the @xmath22 induced by the vortex </S>",
    "<S> is clearly seen in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> for the long junction case , @xmath42 nm , @xmath30 , which results in out - of - phase modulation of the patterns . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the short junction case , @xmath43 nm , @xmath44 is considerably smaller .    figure  [ fig4]c summarizes the measured @xmath45 for all studied nb / ptni / nb junctions . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , @xmath22 , introduced by the vortex increases considerably with the junction length @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed offset @xmath22 in @xmath6 corresponds to the net variation of the josephson phase difference along the junction length @xmath46thus the abrikosov vortex does induce a measurable josephson phase difference in the junction . the dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c indicates that the josephson phase shift induced by the vortex is agreeing well with the polar angle of the vortex within the junction : @xmath47 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a and equation  ( [ q1 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 was calculated by assuming that the vortex is placed in the middle of an electrode @xmath48 , where @xmath49  nm is the average thickness of nb electrodes .    to understand the origin of the observed phenomenon we first exclude several unsustainable scenarios :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the vortex does not introduce a segment of a josephson fluxon in the junction , which might distort @xmath6@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in our structures , the abrikosov vortices were oriented strictly parallel to the junction interface and never cross the junction area . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> such crossing is impossible for the planar junctions , because of the two - dimensional junction geometry . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   a direct field of the vortex stretching into the junction or magnetism in the junction </S>",
    "<S> can not explain the experiments , because the induced field in the junction is opposite to the applied field . indeed , from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a it is seen that the central maximum in @xmath21 is shifted to a positive field after applying @xmath50  oe and to a negative field after applying @xmath20  oe . </S>",
    "<S> since the central maximum corresponds to zero total flux in the junction , the additional field within the junction is always _ opposite _ to the applied field . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the signal can hardly be explained by a finite vortex current at the junction interface . </S>",
    "<S> although it produces a phase shift of the proper sign , its magnitude should decay strongly with the distance from the vortex to the junction@xcite and should for no reason produce a quantized @xmath25 flux offset in the junction . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , it is not possible to explain the characteristic equality between the josephson phase shift and the polar angle of the vortex , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> magnetostatic stray field from the vortex would also give a phase shift with correct sign . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment with the stray field drain , however , demonstrates that the josephson phase shift is unaffected by variation of magnetostatic conditions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is no reason for the stray field to be quantized as @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> when the vortex is placed very close to the junction , clear signatures of the @xmath14    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 junction are seen , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the induced josephson phase shift has a form of a sharp @xmath28 step , which is again difficult to explain in terms of simple magnetostatics because it would require field focusing in one point . </S>",
    "<S> additional discussion can be found in the supplementary .    </S>",
    "<S> our data show an unambiguous correspondence between the josephson phase shift and the polar angle @xmath51 , which represents the variation of the phase of the superconducting condensate around the vortex within the london gauge , equation  ( [ q1 ] ) , as if the phase of the condensate is rigidly coupled to rotation of the current in the vortex . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulation presented in the supplementary demonstrate that equation  ( [ q1 ] ) provides a good overall agreement with all our observations . </S>",
    "<S> it naturally explains the unusual half - integer flux quantization in the junction . </S>",
    "<S> the associated @xmath28-josephson phase shift in this case is simply equal to the change in the polar angle upon going from the left to the right side of the abrikosov vortex . when the vortex is close to the junction , the polar angle changes stepwise , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b , and the junction switches into the @xmath14    @xmath28 state . yet , note that the remarkable success of the london gauge description of the phase shift around the vortex is surprising because phase shifts between any two points ( such as the left and right edges of the junction ) are not gauge invariant and , therefore , should not be measurable . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the presence of the junction as such plays a crucial role on the way from the unmeasurable phase shift of the superconducting condensate to the measurable josephson phase difference . although the seeming rigidity of the gauge field around the abrikosov vortex remains to be clarified , we demonstrate that it can be employed as a tunable and reversible phase battery for josephson electronics . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the geometrical factor @xmath52 , such a battery can provide either a quantized step - like @xmath28-shift , or an arbitrary phase shift in the range @xmath53 . </S>"
