    "the am cvn stars are ultra - compact binaries : white dwarfs accreting from a degenerate , helium - rich companion star .",
    "they have orbital periods shorter than about one hour , clearly indicating the evolved nature of their donor stars .",
    "their accretion disc spectra show mainly helium , with no traces of hydrogen and varying contributions of heavy metals .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "no less than six new members of the small am cvn family , including the first eclipsing system , have been found in the last year or so @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy of one of the new members , sdss j124058.02@xmath4015919.2 ( hereafter sdss j1240 , @xcite ) allowed for a measurement of the orbital period and of the mass ratio , and showed a peculiar and as yet not understood feature of two equally strong bright spots in the accretion disc , in strong contrast with the usual one bright spot attributed to the impact of the accretion stream into the disc . in this paper",
    "we present time - resolved spectroscopy of another recent addition to the family , and a close relative of sdss j1240 : ` sn2003aw ' .",
    "` sn2003aw '  was found as a supernova candidate in february 2003 , based on an observed strong increase in brightness ( maximum @xmath5 ) and its supposed positional coincidence with a faint galaxy @xcite , but @xcite identified it spectroscopically as a helium - rich dwarf nova .",
    "following their announcement , @xcite performed fast white - light photometry on the source , from which a periodic modulation of @xmath6 seconds was derived .",
    "they attributed this period to a superhump , although an analysis of the fourier spectrum showed sidebands to the main period that could point to an orbital modulation rather than a superhump .    over a period of about six months from its detection as a supernova candidate",
    "the source was seen to decline to its apparent quiescent state at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we caught the star in quiescence in december 2003 , when we took a few low - resolution spectra .",
    "our first set of phase - resolved spectroscopic observations was taken in march 2004 , thirteen months after its discovery , with the star still in quiescence near @xmath7 . in may 2004",
    "the star was reported to be in outburst again @xcite with an even higher maximum detected brightness at @xmath8 . in march 2005",
    "we then obtained our second , larger set of phase - resolved spectra , the star having returned to a quiescent state again near @xmath9 .",
    ".summary of our observations of ` sn2003aw ' . [ cols= \" < , < , > , > \" , ]      to determine the spectroscopic period of the binary , we used a modified version of the method used by @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ scargle ] shows the resulting lomb ",
    "scargle periodogram of red wing  blue wing emission line flux ratios .",
    "the long baseline between our 2004 and our 2005 observations causes a fine pattern of aliases on top of the usual 1 day@xmath10 aliases in the periodogram .",
    "the strongest peak occurs at 42.6 cycle / day .",
    "in addition to the main peaks around this frequency there appears to be a weak group of higher harmonics much like in sdss j1240 @xcite .",
    "the strongest harmonic is exactly three times the frequency of the overall strongest peak , compatible with a second bright spot in the accretion disc appearing 120 degrees out of phase .",
    "figure [ tomograms ] shows the trailed spectra and maximum - entropy doppler tomograms @xcite of the strongest lines of ` sn2003aw ' .",
    "there is one strong emission bright spot causing a clear s - wave in the trailed spectra ; the 5015 line also shows a second s - wave at approximately 30% of the flux of the main s - wave .",
    "there are two lines in the current data that are also present in the sdss j1240 data of @xcite , namely 6347 and 5876 ; these are compared directly in figure [ tomogramscompared ] . the double bright spot pattern in the sdss source is not reproduced in ` sn2003aw ' , but there do seem to be very weak secondary bright spots at approximately the same position as in the sdss source .      in section [ spectroscopicperiod ] we determined the spectroscopic period from a periodogram of red wing ",
    "blue wing emission line flux ratios .",
    "the clear kinematic s - wave feature in the trailed spectra , when phase - folded on this spectroscopic period , indicates that we are seeing the orbital motion of the binary .",
    "the strength and sharpness of the bright spot in the doppler tomograms , especially in the 4686 line , allows us to determine the orbital period quite accurately .",
    "the coverage per night during our 2005 run ( about 4.5 hours ) is sufficient that we can distinguish between the true orbital period and its 1 day@xmath10 aliases in the periodogram , since these aliases already lead to noticeable smearing of the bright spot signal when phase - folding the spectra from a single night .",
    "assuming that the bright spot is fixed in the binary frame , we can further refine the orbital period by lining up the phases of the bright spot in the tomograms of march 1 and march 2 , 2005 .",
    "the bright spot phases are determined by fitting a 2-d gaussian in the doppler tomograms .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the fitted bright spot phases with a simple monte carlo simulation , where we make a large ensemble of doppler tomograms from our dataset using the bootstrap method . for each march 1 doppler tomogram",
    "we thus randomly pick 70 spectra out of the set of 70 spectra that we have for this night , allowing for a spectrum to be picked more than once .",
    "we fit a 2-d gaussian to each tomogram in the ensemble ; the resulting distribution of fitted bright spot locations in @xmath11 space gives an estimate of the accuracy allowed by the data .    in practice",
    "there may also be an intrinsic shift in the bright spot phase due to changes in the effective accretion disc radius at the stream  disc impact point .",
    "in such a scenario , the radial velocity of the bright spot in the doppler tomograms is expected to change more than its phase , since both the accretion stream and accretion disc velocity ( at the stream  disc impact point ) change faster with accretion disc radius than their directions , for reasonable accretion disc radii ( see , for instance , figure 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "the radial velocity change measured in the bright spot between march 1 and 2 , 2005 thus gives us a reasonable measure for the maximum intrinsic bright spot phase shift .",
    "we add this radial velocity change to the statistical fit uncertainty from the monte carlo ensemble ; both give an uncertainty of about 20 km / s .",
    "the total uncertainty in lining up the bright spots from march 1 and 2 , 2005 thus comes out at @xmath124 degrees . the orbital period and its error then become @xmath13 seconds .",
    "the one - year baseline between our 2004 and 2005 runs does not allow us to trace the orbit all the way in between , since one revolution fewer or more between these runs would correspond to a phase drift of just about one degree between the two consecutive nights of our 2005 run , which is below the accuracy with which we can measure the bright spot s phases in the 2005 data .",
    "@xcite first modelled the accretion disc spectrum of the 46-minute orbital period am cvn star gp com and found a strong underabundance of heavy metals relative to the sun .",
    "in particular , expected emission lines of singly ionised iron , silicon and calcium were missing from the spectrum . the recently discovered am cvn star sdss j1240 showed clear 5169 , 6347 and 6371 emission , compatible with solar abundances @xcite .",
    "calcium h & k were also expected if solar abundances of heavy metals were assumed , but could not be found in the spectrum .",
    "they do show up strongly in the spectrum of ` sn2003aw '  presented here .",
    "the spectrum of ` sn2003aw '  furthermore shows possible weak iron features near 5276 and 5317   not seen in sdss j1240 ( cf .",
    "figure [ average ] ) . the possible na d emission feature in",
    "both sdss j1240 and ` sn2003aw ' , mentioned in section [ averagespectrum ] , must originate in relatively cool parts of the accretion disc  a large part of the disc where most of the emission lines originate is expected to be at @xmath1411,000k ( see @xcite for a discussion ) , where the sodium should be largely ionised and the na d lines would not show up .",
    "the feature does not show any bright spot ( nor the typical double - peaked profile ) in the trailed spectra , which fits with being na d or a similar low - temperature feature .",
    "we now have two emission - line systems that seem to be strongly underabundant in heavy metals ( gp com , @xmath15min and v396 hya ( = ce  315 ) , @xmath16min ) , which together with their high proper motions suggests a halo origin , and two systems showing more or less the expected metal lines if solar abundances of heavy metals are assumed ( sdss j1240 , @xmath17min and ` sn2003aw ' , @xmath18min ) .",
    "the stronger silicon and iron lines in ` sn2003aw '  relative to helium ( by about a factor of 2 , see table [ eqw ] ) can probably be accommodated by a higher column density of gas in the disc ",
    "e.g.  due to a higher mass transfer rate  and saturated helium lines .",
    "the complete absence of calcium h & k in sdss j1240 is more difficult to explain , but together with the notion that the 6347 & 6371 lines in sdss j1240 originate exclusively from the bright spots , this suggests somewhat higher abundances of heavy metals in ` sn2003aw '  ( if we assume both discs to be largely at @xmath1411,000k ) .",
    "a more detailed study of these optically thin helium - dominated accretion discs is beyond the scope of this paper , but will be interesting for estimating the mass transfer rates and for putting more accurate constraints on the chemical abundances in the discs .",
    "the remarkable double bright spot feature in sdss j1240 ( see @xcite for a discussion on its possible origins ) was one of the motivations for obtaining the observations presented here . since the average spectrum of ` sn2003aw '  looked so similar , and since the suggested orbital period from the photometric superhump was quite close to that of sdss j1240 , it was interesting to see if the accretion disc would show the same behaviour .    from the trailed spectra and doppler tomograms ( figure [ tomograms ] )",
    "it is clear that the 5015 line does indeed show a second s - wave much like in sdss j1240 , but it is significantly weaker at about 30% of the integrated flux of the main s - wave . a direct comparison of the 5876 and of the 6347 line , for which there are phase - resolved spectra of both objects , shows the weakness of the second bright spot in these lines compared to sdss j1240 ( figure [ tomogramscompared ] ) .",
    "so more than anything else , ` sn2003aw '  adds to the diversity of the second bright spot feature .",
    "a very recently discovered new am cvn star , 2qz j142701.6@xmath4012310 @xcite with a suggested orbital period near 36 minutes ( again based on a photometric superhump period ) , even closer to the orbital period of sdss j1240 , may be a nice test case for this still enigmatic feature .",
    "we measure an orbital period @xmath13 seconds .",
    "this proves that the photometric period of @xmath6 seconds first detected by @xcite is a superhump period .",
    "therefore the helium dwarf nova ` sn2003aw ' , like the permanent superhumper am cvn @xcite , exhibits positive superhumps , which are usually explained as the beat period of the orbit and the prograde precession of a tidally deformed eccentric accretion disc . if we employ the latest empirical relation between the mass ratio @xmath19 and the superhump period excess @xmath20 , as determined from superhump and orbital periods of a large number of hydrogen - rich dwarf novae by @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 we find @xmath23 .",
    "this compares to @xmath24 determined kinematically for sdss j1240 @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the relation ( [ superhump ] ) may not be well - calibrated for these extreme mass ratios , and in reality @xmath20 might depend on more parameters than just @xmath19 .",
    "the quoted error on the mass ratio may therefore be a bit optimistic .",
