    "moreover , we either have that @xmath282 or @xmath283 , depending on whether or not the rim hook has height exceeding 1 . in either case , it is not possible to remove a rim hook of size @xmath12 from @xmath5 starting from any row other than 1 .",
    "consequently , if we remove a rim hook of size @xmath12 from @xmath5 to obtain a partition @xmath271 , we necessarily first remove the rim hook @xmath6 , and then a further @xmath45 boxes from @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that @xmath271 satisfies @xmath43 , and so it is an @xmath12-core , which implies claims ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . the rim hook @xmath44 has northeastern - most box in the same row as the southwestern - most box of @xmath6 , which implies claim ( 3 ) and  .    for the last claim , as @xmath92 contains @xmath247 diagonals",
