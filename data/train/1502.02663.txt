    "the landmark survey of @xcite added a mass spectrum , stellar evolution and a tidal boundary , and also revealed the importance of the initial structure of the star cluster .",
    "but several other factors also influence the lifetime of star clusters , including the binary population ( e.g. @xcite ) , the form of the galactic orbit ( e.g. @xcite ) , the form of the galactic potential and tidal shocking ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the crossing time scale @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we add one more influence : natal kicks of neutron stars ( ns ) . though neutron stars may account for less than 2% of the cluster by mass , we find , astonishingly , that the presence or absence of kicks may change the lifetime of a star cluster by almost a factor of four . though the existence of natal kicks of neutron stars is not in doubt ,",

    "as it happens , they imposed no natal kicks on neutron stars , and it was the attempt to reproduce some of their results that led to our discovery .",

    "we have performed a survey of simulations in an accelerating , non - rotating frame , using a number of particles between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a kroupa imf @xcite , with the mass of the stars between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( resulting in a theoretical mean mass @xmath5 ) , and metallicity @xmath6 .",

    "for the majority of our runs we have used a roche - lobe filling @xcite model with @xmath0 as initial condition .",
    "additional simulations have been performed by increasing the initial concentration of the king profile ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the clusters start at a galactic radius of @xmath13 kpc , with an initial velocity of @xmath14 ( in the circular case ) ; in the elliptical case the apogalacticon is at @xmath13 kpc and the initial speed there is reduced appropriately , while the size of the cluster is determined by assuming a roche - lobe filling condition at perigalacticon .",

    "column 8 gives the dissolution time , which , following , is defined as the time when @xmath18 of the mass was lost from the cluster , while column 10 gives the core - collapse time .",

    "the moment of core collapse @xmath19 has been determined by inspecting the time evolution of the core radius and of the innermost lagrangian radius enclosing @xmath20 of the total mass .",
    "the main result of our investigation is that the presence or the absence of ns natal velocity kicks can affect significantly the lifetime of star clusters , up to almost a factor of four .",
    "this striking result is illustrated by a series of `` reference models '' ( with @xmath0 , @xmath21 , and n = @xmath22k , @xmath23k , @xmath24k , @xmath25k , and @xmath26k ) , with or without ns velocity kicks ; the time evolution of the bound mass of these models is presented in fig .",

    "the difference in the behaviour of the models with or without ns kicks starts early in their evolution ( @xmath27 ) and leads to a dramatic contrast in the slope of the graph at the final stages of evolution ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "an important aspect of the very rapid dissolution of the models with ns kicks is that , in almost all cases , they fail to reach core collapse during their evolution , as opposed to the models without ns kicks , which show signatures of core collapse at a time corresponding to @xmath29 . the only exception is given by model @xmath26kk , which reaches core collapse at the very late stages of evolution , @xmath30 myr after the formal dissolution time ( see tab",
    ".  [ parameter ] , row  1 , and the corresponding black dot in fig .",
    "[ fig : mboverm0_128k ] ) .",
    "the fact that it reaches core collapse at all , while larger models do not , is attributable to its short initial relaxation time .",
    "we have also considered two additional pairs of models , as representative cases of the regime of high initial concentration ( @xmath12 ; models @xmath22kk7 and @xmath22kn7 ) and of the evolution of a star cluster on an elliptic orbit ( @xmath8 ; models @xmath22kke and @xmath22kne ) . here",
    "the effects of the presence of ns kicks on the star cluster lifetime are less severe compared to those on the `` reference models '' , but they are still significant ( see fig .",

    "@xmath22kke reach core collapse , although at a very late stage of evolution .",
    "of the systems without ns kicks , model @xmath22kne reaches core collapse at a mass comparable to that of `` reference models '' without ns kicks , while model @xmath22kn7 has the largest mass at @xmath19 of all the models in our survey which reach core collapse ; such a result is not surprising , given its initial concentration .",
    "another useful diagnostic of the differences between models with and without ns kicks is provided by the mean mass of stars in the innermost lagrangian shell , enclosing @xmath20 of the total bound mass of a system .",
    "its time evolution is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmean ] , for all models in our survey with @xmath31k particles . in almost all cases ,",
    "the mean mass in the innermost shell initially shows a decrease , which is due to the early evolution and escape of massive stars ; as expected , this effect is more pronounced for systems with ns kicks . nonetheless , after only a few gyr",
    ", the value of the central mean mass starts to increase , reflecting the process of mass segregation . for models that reach core collapse ,",
    "the mean mass in the final stages of evolution falls within the range @xmath32 , which indicates the dominance of neutron stars in the central regions of the system .",
    "not surprisingly , the rapidly dissolving model @xmath22kk ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mmean ] , red line ) shows a final mean mass which is comparable to the initial value .    , on circular orbits .",

    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]      despite our best efforts in reproducing the initial conditions and the numerical set - up described by , we note that there are still non - negligible discrepancies between our models without ns natal kicks and the corresponding ones in their original investigation ( see table  [ parameter ] and figs .  [ fig : mboverm0_128k ] and [ fig : mboverm0_ecc_w7 ] ) .",
    "we have attempted to identify the main reasons for these discrepancies in the intrinsic differences between the codes used to perform the simulations , and in particular slightly different stellar evolution prescriptions .",
    "we performed our simulations by using the gpu version of nbody6 @xcite , while used the public grape-6 version of nbody4 @xcite .",
    "the latter treats components of binaries as single stars , without collisions or exchange of mass , and the resulting differences might partially explain the increasing discrepancy after core collapse for the models depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mboverm0_ecc_w7 ] , because of the increase in the number of binaries at this time .",
    "moreover , used a prescription for the properties of stellar remnants by @xcite , while in nbody6 the @xcite recipe is now used . to test this",
    ", we carried out a simulation of model @xmath22kn with the @xcite prescription for stellar remnants , but we obtained a dissolution time of @xmath33 gyr , which reduces the discrepancy by only about 30% ( see data for model 128kn in table  [ parameter ] ) .    to assess stochastic effects ( such as run - to - run variations ) we also performed additional simulations of models @xmath22kn and @xmath23kn by evolving different numerical realizations of the same initial conditions , and by evolving the same realization in several independent simulations ( as in ) .",
    "finally , we performed a simulation of model @xmath22kn in which the escapers were progressively removed ( as in ) , but again without any significant difference ( @xmath34 gyr ) .",
    "none of these effects was able , individually , to account for the observed discrepancy .",
    "therefore , we believe that the small but systematic discrepancy between our models without ns kicks and the corresponding ones in results from a combination of all the effects mentioned above , and others which we have not studied , including possible differences in the way in which models are virialised and scaled in different codes .",
    "as we shall show later ( sect .",
    "[ sec:2modes ] ) the sensitivity of these runs to small effects is such that apparently trivial differences could have significant effects .    , on elliptic orbits ; ( ii ) @xmath12 , on circular orbits . as in fig .  [",
    "fig : mboverm0_128k ] , models with ns kicks are denoted by red lines ( right to left : @xmath22kk7 and @xmath22kke ) , and without ns kicks by blue lines ( right to left : @xmath22kn7 and @xmath22kne ) .",

    "we have found that the presence or absence of neutron star kicks , in the models we have studied , can change the lifetime of a star cluster by a large factor .",
    "we shall now try to interpret our results in the context of previous studies of star cluster dissolution mechanisms , with the aim of understanding why it is that a process which affects such a small fraction of the mass can have such a dramatic effect .",
    "we consider initially tidally filling , multi - mass models with stellar evolution . over the years",
    ", several numerical investigations have shown that the dissolution time is strongly affected by two factors : the initial relaxation time and the initial concentration ( represented by the king parameter @xmath35 ) . in particular @xcite showed that , for a salpeter - like imf , their models with @xmath36 or @xmath37 dissolved quickly , in less than a gyr , and without core collapse , while models with @xmath38 all entered core collapse , after about 10 gyr or longer . clusters with @xmath39 and a steeper imf ( and hence a longer time scale for mass loss by stellar evolution ) could enter core collapse before dissolution , provided that relaxation was fast enough . thus there is a tension between the time scales of stellar evolution and relaxation , which plays out differently depending on the concentration .",
    "recently @xcite noted that the clusters which dissolve by the effects of stellar evolution lose their mass in a qualitatively different way from those dominated by relaxation .",
    "the former , as they approach dissolution , lose the last fraction of their mass ( which may be substantial ) extremely rapidly , whereas the latter lose mass at a rate which is steady , and sometimes even declining .",
    "whitehead et al . also noted that the dividing line between the two modes of dissolution is quite sharp .",
    "for that reason it would not be surprising if a very small effect , such as the loss or retention of ns , were to place a cluster in one mode of dissolution or the other .",
    "the two kinds of behaviour described by @xcite are plainly visible in several previous studies of star cluster evolution , such as @xcite , and they are visible in fig .  [",
    "fig : mboverm0_128k ] of the present letter , where all models with kicks end their evolution by losing mass precipitately ( except for the case n = @xmath26k ) , whereas the others lose mass at a more moderate rate .",
    "we refer to these two cases as `` jumping '' and `` skiing '' , respectively .",
    "[ fig : mboverm0_128k ] also illustrates the point made by @xcite , i.e. the two modes of dissolution are characterised by the presence or absence of core collapse before dissolution .",
    "indeed we see that the clusters with and without natal kicks ( except for the case n = @xmath26k ) lie on either side of the divide between the two modes .    in order to visualise the transition between skiing and jumping models , it has been particularly instructive for us to take on the point of view first suggested by @xcite , and to explore the evolution of our models in the plane defined by the concentration ( parameterized by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the core radius ) and the mass which remains bound to the system . in this representation ,",
    "a system which experiences exclusively stellar evolution effects would gradually lose mass , while reducing its concentration due to the progressive expansion , giving rise to a track moving down in the plane and to the left ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mmean ] in * ? ? ?",
    "the tracks qualitatively resemble those of some of our models , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : weinberg10 ] .",
    "these are four of the models with kicks , shown in red ; and one of these ( 128kk ) is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : weinberg_main ] .    in weinberg s treatment ,",
    "dealing with the slow evolution of spherical equilibrium models , the tracks end when equilibrium is no longer possible ; the tracks end at points along a curve , which is shown as a dashed near - vertical curve in these figures .",
    "models can cross this curve , but then lose mass on a dynamical time scale , explaining the jumping profile of the corresponding curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : mboverm0_128k ] and [ fig : mboverm0_ecc_w7 ] .",
    "though its precise position may differ slightly when the simplifying assumptions of weinberg s models are relaxed , we refer to this curve as `` weinberg s cliff '' .    in weinberg s models , mass - loss",
    "is driven by stellar evolution only , and his results should be applicable when this process dominates . when the effects of two - body relaxation are dominant , one of the natural consequences is the progressive increase of the central concentration , leading to core collapse .",
    "this results in a track oriented to the right - hand - side of the plane , behaviour which can be immediately recognised in the remaining models in fig .",
    "[ fig : weinberg10 ] and [ fig : weinberg_main ] .",
    "it should not come as a surprise now that all long - lived , `` skiing '' models show signatures of core collapse , in contrast with short - lived , `` jumping '' models .",
    "these figures strongly suggest the existence of trajectories in which the two processes , stellar evolution and relaxation , are in a delicate balance overall , even though stellar evolution dominates early on and relaxation dominates thereafter .",
    "we have been particularly fortunate to have included in our survey two models whose evolution almost perfectly delimits a `` separatrix '' between `` skiing '' and `` jumping '' systems ( see the innermost pair of red lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : weinberg10 ] , which correspond to models @xmath26kk and @xmath25kk ) .",
    "even more strikingly , the model @xmath22kke , despite the oscillations generated by the time - dependent tide , offers an excellent representation of the `` separatrix '' ( see the green line in fig .",
    "[ fig : weinberg_main ] ) .",
    "evidently , the models that we have studied lie close to the separatrix dividing jumping models ( which are dominated by stellar evolution , lose mass rapidly at the end of their lives , and do not reach core collapse ) and skiing models ( which are dominated by two - body relaxation , lose mass gently towards the end of their lives , and reach core collapse ) . if neutron stars are given no natal kick , as in model @xmath22kn , or the models of @xcite , the trend to mass segregation and core collapse is accentuated , and the model moves across the separatrix into the domain of relaxation - dominated evolution .",
    "but we warn the reader against interpreting this as a general rule .",
    "kicks were applied to both model 8kk and model 16kk ( the innermost pair of red lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : weinberg10 ] ) , and they lie on opposite sides of the separatrix . the 8kk model , because of the low particle number and consequently smaller relaxation time , is sufficiently dominated by relaxation to lie in the skiing regime .     with ( red lines ) and without ( blue lines )",
    "the black dots show the moment of core collapse , the black horizontal dashed line at @xmath42 marks the formal dissolution condition , and the black vertical dashed line denotes `` weinberg s cliff '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mmean ] in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . , scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "these considerations do not immediately explain , however , why the lifetime should be so different as a factor of nearly four .",
    "but the example of models 32kk and 8kn , which lose mass in almost the same way until core collapse in the latter model ( fig.[fig : mboverm0_128k ] ) , shows that the effects of skiing and jumping lead to different lifetimes .",
    "though the difference is only a factor 1.13 in this case , it seems plausible that the effect could be much bigger if the event which determines the mode of dissolution occurred very early in the lifetime of a model , e.g. the ejection of neutron stars .",
    "furthermore , because our models lie so close to the separatrix between the two modes , it would not be surprising if very minor systematic differences in the initial conditions were to lead to significant systematic differences in the lifetime , as discussed in sect .",
    "while this letter has focused on kicks by neutron stars , the lesson to learn is that apparently minor changes can have very large effects , especially for clusters close to the transition between different modes of dissolution .",
    "other factors which should be taken into account include the presence and properties of primordial binaries , variations in the high - mass end of the imf , and the degree of primordial mass segregation , which influences both the importance of mass loss by stellar evolution and the role of remnants , not only ns but also stellar - mass black holes .",
    "the importance of these factors depends on the location of the dividing line between the two modes of dissolution that we have discussed , which can be assessed only by means of appropriate numerical experiments .",
    "we have presented evidence , based on @xmath43-body simulations of the evolution of initially tidally filling king models with stellar evolution , that the presence or absence of ns natal velocity kicks can play a crucial role in the long - term survival of model star clusters . in particular",
    "we show that some of the basic models in the landmark study of @xcite are especially sensitive to this effect , which can change their lifetime by almost a factor of four .",
    "we explain this finding by showing that the models lie close to a dividing line between ( i ) models which are dominated by the effects of mass - loss from stellar evolution , and whose evolution ends with a steepening rate of mass loss , and ( ii ) models whose dynamical evolution is dominated by two - body relaxation , which reach core collapse before dissolving , and do so with a gently decreasing rate of mass loss .",
