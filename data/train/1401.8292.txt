    "one unavoidable ingredient in the process of formation of intermediate / high - mass stars is that they are usually found associated with clusters of lower - mass stars ( e.g. ,  lada & lada 2003 ; rivilla et al .",
    "2013 ) . however , the process yielding the formation of these clusters is not clear , as it remains ambiguous how a cloud core fragments to finally form a cluster .",
    "the observed star formation efficiency is by far much smaller than the predicted if gravity dominated the dynamics of the collapse ( see e.g. ,  kruijssen 2013 for a review ) , and the number of subcondensations typically embedded in massive dense cores is again smaller by one order of magnitude than the predicted from a pure jeans fragmentation analysis ( e.g. ,  hennemann et al .  2009 ; zhang et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ; bontemps et al .  2010 ;",
    "longmore et al .  2011 ;",
    "pillai et al .  2011 ; wang et al .  2011 ; lee et al .  2013 ) .",
    "thus , a broad observational evidence indicates that additional physical ingredients competing with gravity must play an important role in the fragmentation process , such as angular momentum , stellar feedback , magnetic fields and turbulence .",
    "numerical simulations are becoming crucial to establish the relative importance of each of these ingredients in the fragmentation process .",
    "simulations of fragmentation of rotating cores with different equations of state show that cores with some angular momentum easily fragment into multiple objects ( e.g. ,  boss & bodenheimer 1979 ; bate & burkert 1997 ) and thus need of additional mechanisms to decrease the fragmentation down to the observed levels ( see goodwin et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) . a crucial ingredient in this sense",
    "is the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "studies on the effects of magnetic fields in the evolution of a collapsing and rotating core indicate that a strong magnetic field can suppress fragmentation as it constitutes an additional form of support and also via the so - called ` magnetic braking ' ( e.g. ,  hosking & whitworth 2004 ; mellon & li 2008 ; hennebelle & teyssier 2008 ) , which is very effective in removing a significant part of the initial angular momentum through torsional alfvn waves .",
    "similarly , radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of turbulent massive dense cores show that the combined effects of radiative feedback ( e.g. ,  krumholz et al .  2007 ; peters et al .",
    "2011 ) and magnetic field can sum to efficiently suppress fragmentation ( e.g. ,  hennebelle et al .  2011 , commeron et al .",
    "2011 ; myers et al .",
    "2013 ) , yielding a better match with the observations ( e.g. ,  palau et al .",
    "in addition , submillimeter observations show that the magnetic field is important in the dynamical evolution and fragmentation of massive dense cores ( e.g. ,  girart et al .",
    "2009 , 2013 ; hezareh et al .",
    "another ingredient which is probably playing a role in the fragmentation process is supersonic turbulence .",
    "theoretical studies show that turbulence generates density structures due to supersonic shocks that compress and fragment the gas efficiently , especially for large mach numbers ( e.g. ,  padoan et al .",
    "2001 , schmeja & klessen 2004 ; vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "more recently it has been shown that the turbulence mode , solenoidal or compressive ( e.g. ,  federrath et al .",
    "2008 ) , affects differently the cloud structure and fragmentation .",
    "solenoidal turbulence corresponds to a null divergence of the driving force ( divergence - free ) and arises from galactic rotation and magneto - rotational instabilities , and seems to be at work in the rosette and polaris flare clouds ( e.g. ,  hily - blant et al .",
    "2008 ; federrath et al .",
    "compressive turbulence corresponds to a null curl of the driving force ( curl - free ) and can be produced by expanding supernova shells or hii regions ( e.g. ,  federrath et al .",
    "2010 ) , as seen in the pipe nebula and the orionb cloud ( peretto et al .  2012 ; schneider et al .",
    "numerical simulations comparing both types of turbulence indicate that compressive turbulence promotes fragmentation and generates high density contrast structures , while solenoidal turbulence slows fragmentation down and keeps a smooth density structure in the cloud ( e.g. ,  federrath et al .",
    "2010 ; girichidis et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "in addition to these physical agents opposing to gravity , the outcome of numerical simulations also depends on the geometry and physical properties of the collapsing core , in particular the density profile .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations show that highly concentrated cores ( e.g. ,  @xmath1 ) lead to the formation of one single massive star , while flat density profiles ( @xmath2 or flatter ) produce an important number of low - mass stars ( e.g. ,  myhill & kaula 1992 ; burkert et al .",
    "1997 ; girichidis et al .",
    "this trend appears to be seen in high resolution observations of irdcg28.34 + 0.06 , where three massive dense cores with different density profiles show varying degrees of fragmentation ( zhang et al .",
    "2009 ; wang et al .",
    "finally , the substructure of molecular gas within a dense core is decreasing with time as the core turns gas into stars , as shown for example by smith et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "from an observational point of view , most of the studies focusing on fragmentation of massive dense cores deal with single regions and/or do not reach high enough spatial scales to study individual fragments in the core ( @xmath32000  au ; e.g. ,  longmore et al .  2011 ; pillai et al .  2011 ; miettinen 2012 ; beuther et al .  2013 ; kainulainen et al .  2013 ; takahashi et al .  2013 ) .",
    "recently , bontemps et al .",
    "( 2010 ) study a sample of six massive dense cores in cygnus x and conducted a consistent analysis for all the regions , finding cores with a variety of fragmentation levels .",
    "a subsequent study by palau et al .",
    "( 2013 ) focused on a list of 18 massive dense cores ( including bontemps et al .",
    "2010 sources ) , and observed with similar spatial resolution ( @xmath3  au ) , sensitivity ( down to @xmath4  @xmath5 ) , and field of view ( @xmath6  pc of diameter ) , again reveals different fragmentation levels , with about @xmath7% of the regions showing no fragmentation at all .",
    "palau et al .",
    "( 2013 ) study possible correlations between the fragmentation level and properties of the cores such as mass , average density , evolutionary indicators , rotational - to - gravitational energy and turbulent velocity dispersion ( although these last two properties should be studied in a larger sample ) , and find no clear trend of fragmentation level with any of these core properties . in that work",
    ", two main properties of the cores remained to be studied in relation to fragmentation , mainly the magnetic field and the density structure .",
    "while the magnetic field can not currently be assessed in this sample in a uniform way , the density structure has been studied in roughly half of the sample ( e.g. ,  beuther et al .",
    "2002a ; mueller et al .",
    "2002 ; crimier et al .  2010 ; van der tak et al .",

    ", we present the results of our fits ; in section  4 , we discuss the possible trend between fragmentation level and density structure .",

    "[ fobs1]13 ) .",
    "in order to characterize the spatial structure of the massive dense cores , we computed the circularly averaged radial intensity profile , in rings of @xmath8 width , as a function of the projected distance from the core center at both 850 and 450  @xmath0 m  when possible , and applied the model described in fig .",

    "the radial profile was calculated in particular angular ` sectors ' centered on the core peak , to avoid strong negative emission in the maps ( ngc7129-firs2 at 450  @xmath0 m ) , or contamination from a nearby strong core ( w3irs5 ) or from the dr21 ridge ( cygx - n48 , cygx - n53 , dr21-oh ) . for these cases we did not use the values of the flux density at 850 and 450  @xmath0",

    "( 1997 ) are spatially overlapping the core emission and we prefer to avoid them . ] .",
    "for the case of cygx - n48 , we extracted the intensity profile avoiding the contribution from the north , where the strong dr21-oh core lies ; for dr21-oh and cygx - n53 we extracted the profile in a sector with no restrictions in the east - west direction , but allowing it to extend @xmath11 in the north - south direction , which corresponds to the approximate width of the dr21 filament in the east - west direction .",
    "the sed of each massive dense core was built from centimeter wavelengths up to 5060  @xmath0 m , as this is approximately the wavelength where envelope and disk contributions start to be comparable ( e.g. ,  crimier et al .",
    "2010 ; commeron et al .",
    "2012 ) , and here we only model the envelope contribution .",
    "to build the seds we used the data compiled in palau et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , which included flux densities at different frequencies from iras , jcmt / scuba , akari and iram30 m data when available .",

    "flux densities obtained in heavily saturated spitzer / mips2 data were considered as lower limits .",
    "we also considered as lower limits the millimeter / submillimeter flux densities measured with an interferometer , as part of the core emission is filtered out and we did not take this into account in our model .",
    "for omc-1s we recompiled the sed because the sed in palau et al .",
    "( 2013 ) was built for the source 136@xmath12 ( about @xmath13 north of the submillimeter peak ) , while now we have considered the fluxes associated with the submillimeter peak , as we are modeling the submillimeter profiles .",
    "in addition , we used the fir / submillimeter / centimeter fluxes from the literature .",
    "the apertures where fluxes were assessed were figured out from the literature or adopted as reported in the used catalogs and references ( see above ) , and for peak intensities we took the beam as aperture radius .",
    "c +      we modeled the thermal emission of the cores at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths with a spherically symmetric envelope of gas and dust , with density and temperature decreasing with radius .",
    "the density and temperature were assumed to be power - laws of radius , with indices @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . for the dust opacity law we assumed that the dust opacity is a power - law of frequency with index @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an arbitrary reference frequency .",
    "the values used for the dust opacity were those of ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) , for thin ice mantles at a gas density of @xmath21 @xmath22 , i.e.  @xmath23 @xmath24 g@xmath25 for @xmath26  ghz , being @xmath18 a free parameter of the model .",
