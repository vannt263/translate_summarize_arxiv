    "the control of separated flows is of major academic and industrial interest . at the interface of control",
    "theory and fluid mechanics it is relevant in many engineering domains , such as aeronautics and combustion .",
    "+ flow separation usually induces flow recirculations @xcite , which can be detrimental ( higher drag , lower lift ) or beneficial ( enhanced mixing ) . because it creates a spatially bounded separation at the step edge @xcite , the backward - facing step ( bfs ) is a benchmark geometry for separated flows .",
    "+   + control of the flow downstream a bfs has been the subject of much research both numerically and experimentally .",
    "there are three distinct approaches to flow control : passive control which involves altering the geometry to yield the desired effect , open - loop control where power is supplied to the system to alter its operating conditions @xcite and closed - loop control @xcite .",
    "passive control uses permanent actuations and can not adapt to changes in the flow conditions @xcite .",
    "open - loop control can vary with user input and often involves an input - output map where desired outputs are matched to inputs @xcite .",
    "closed - loop control enhances open - loop control by using a feedback element to gauge the state of the flow in order to better follow commands and reject disturbances . +   +",
    "this approach to control can be further declined : extremum - seeking controllers , where a cost variable is defined and minimized @xcite ; black box control where the flow is excited in order to compute a model of the flow system without _ a priori _ physical knowledge ; model based control , where a model of the flow system is devised using physical knowledge and/or empirical data , which is then is used to compute appropriate actuation @xcite . a good overview of various control methods is given in @xcite .",
    "+   + regarding actuation , periodic forcing can trigger kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities in the shear layer which prompts the creation of spanwise vortices . forcing the shear layer close to its natural frequency",
    "has been shown to be most effective at reducing the recirculation bubble in separated flows , @xcite .",
    "thus , dynamically identifying the natural shedding frequency can be essential when considering closed loop control . unfortunately , from an experimental point of view , measuring the natural shear layer frequency can be challenging , especially with wall sensors .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple model based closed - looped control scheme where the flow is actuated at its natural shedding frequency , computed in real - time by optical means .",
    "experiments were carried out in a hydrodynamic channel in which the flow is driven by gravity . the flow is stabilized by divergent and convergent sections separated by honeycombs .",
    "the test section is @xmath0  cm long with a rectangular cross section @xmath1  cm wide and @xmath2  cm high . + the quality of the main stream can be quantified in terms of flow uniformity and turbulence intensity .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath3 is computed for the highest free stream velocity featured in our experimental set - up .",
    "we obtain @xmath4  cm.s@xmath5 which corresponds to turbulence levels of @xmath6 .",
    "+ the mean free stream velocity @xmath7 can go up to @xmath8  cm.s@xmath5 leading to a maximum reynolds number @xmath9 .",
    "a specific leading - edge profile is used to smoothly start the boundary layer which then grows downstream along the flat plate , before reaching the edge of the step @xmath10  cm downstream .",
    "the boundary layer is laminar and follows a blasius profile .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .          the bfs geometry and the main geometric parameters are shown in figure  [ fig : dimensions ] .",
    "bfs height is @xmath11  cm .",
    "channel height is @xmath12  cm for a channel width @xmath13  cm .",
    "the vertical expansion ratio is @xmath14 and the spanwise aspect ratio is @xmath15 .      the flow is seeded with 20  @xmath16 neutrally buoyant polyamid seeding particles .",
    "they are illuminated by a laser sheet created by a 2w continuous laser beam operating at @xmath17  nm . images of the symmetry plane are recorded using a basler aca 2000 - 340 km 8bit cmos camera .",
    "velocity field computations are run on a gforce gtx 580 graphics card .",
    "+ the algorithm used to compute the velocity fields is a lukas - kanade optical flow algorithm @xcite called folki developped at onera .",
    "its offline and online accuracy have been demonstrated and detailed by @xcite .",
    "the algorithm was used off - line by @xcite . the gpu version ( folki - gpu )",
    "was improved @xcite to allow for the computation of instantaneous velocity fields in real time at a sampling frequency @xmath18 up to 100 hz .",
    "thus the state of the flow can be computed in real - time up to 100 hz and then be used as an input in closed - loop control .",
    "another advantage of the optical flow algorithm is its ability to compute accurate velocity fields even when velocity changes by as much as a factor of 2 without adjusting acquisition or computation parameters .",
    "fields are @xmath19  @xmath20 and capture the whole recirculation regardless of reynolds numbers .      actuation is provided by a flush slot jet , 0.1  cm long and 9  cm wide .",
    "injection is normal to the wall .",
    "the distance between the injection slot and step edge is @xmath21  cm  @xmath22 ( figure  [ fig : dimensions ] ) .",
    "water coming from a pressurized tank enters a plenum and goes through a volume of glass beads designed to homogenize the incoming flow .",
    "jet amplitude is controlled by changing tank pressure .",
    "+ the flow is modulated by a one - way voltage driven solenoid - valve .",
    "a constant amplitude square signal is sent to the valve .",
    "the duty cycle @xmath23 , defined as the ratio between the time during which the valve is opened @xmath24 and total cycle time @xmath25 , is kept constant at @xmath26  % which has been shown to be an optimal value for this setup @xcite .",
    "the only varying actuation feature is the frequency of the actuation @xmath27 .",
    "the most commonly used variable to quantify the state of the flow downstream the bfs is the length of the recirculation bubble @xcite . however ,",
    "the recirculation area @xmath28 has been shown to be a proper state parameter , easier to compute when using 2d instantaneous velocity fields @xcite . because @xmath28 is computed using the whole 2d flow field , it is able to better capture the influence of actuation on flow structures near the step edge and its influence on the whole recirculation bubble",
    ". it is computed over the 2d velocity field :    @xmath29    where a is the 2d velocity field area , h is the heaviside function and @xmath30 the longitudinal velocity .",
    "kelvin - helmholtz spanwise vortices created in the shear layer of the bfs ( figure  [ fig : dimensions ] ) strongly influence the recirculation area .",
    "using optical flow instantaneous velocity measurements allows the detection of kh vortices as they are shed in the shear layer . an effective way of detecting vortices is to compute the swirling strength criterion @xmath31 in the instantaneous two - components velocity fields .",
    "this criterion was first introduced and subsequently improved by @xcite who analyzed the velocity gradient tensor and proposed that the vortex core be defined as a region where @xmath32 has complex conjugate eigenvalues . for 2d data @xmath33",
    "can be computed quickly and efficiently following equation  [ eq : lci ] :    @xmath34    when such a quantity is real , else @xmath35 .",
    "the shedding frequency is obtained by spatially averaging @xmath33 in the vertical direction at @xmath36 .",
    "the sampling frequency is @xmath37 60hz .",
    "this is equivalent to counting vortices as they pass through an imaginary vertical line ( figure  [ fig : freq_1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : freq_2 ] shows a typical time series of fluctuations of @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "every peaks correspond to a vortex moving across the @xmath40 line .",
    "figure  [ fig : freq_3 ] shows the corresponding frequency spectrum obtained by fourier transform .",
    "the natural shedding frequency @xmath41 is well defined .",
    "it leads to a strouhal number based on the step height @xmath42 for the kh shedding frequency .",
    "+   +    because recirculation changes with @xmath43 and control actuation it is important to choose a position where shedding frequency can be computed reliably .",
    "this is done by placing the detection zone such that initial vortex shedding position is always upstream whatever the operating conditions . in practice",
    "this is achieved by placing the detection zone sufficiently downstream the bfs , in this case at @xmath44 .",
    "the closed - loop control algorithm is described in figure  [ fig : control_algorithm ] .",
    "a new quantity , called @xmath45 , is introduced .",
    "it corresponds to the longitudinal velocity field spatially averaged in the upper corner of the velocity fields , far from the boundaries .",
    "when the external flow is stabilized , i.e. when @xmath45 does not change for a given period @xmath46 , then the shedding frequency @xmath41 is computed over a given time @xmath47 .",
    "once @xmath41 has been estimated , the control begins : the jet starts pulsing at resulting @xmath48 . at this point shedding frequency",
    "is locked to pulse frequency leading , in principle , to a minimization of the recirculation area .",
    "+ the actuation is kept constant as long as @xmath49 does not change .",
    "this is done by continuously polling the value described in equation [ eq : polling ] .",
    "it is a measure of how much the flow has changed since the last frequency computation .",
    "if the value goes above a given threshold , frequency is re - computed , thus completing the loop .",
    "the threshold depends on the noise of the monitoring variable and should be chosen such that only significant changes prompt re - computation .",
    "+ @xmath50        here @xmath51 is chosen to determine whether frequency can be reliably computed but many other quantities might be used as inputs .",
    "@xmath46 should be chosen such that computation starts after there are no significant changes in the monitoring variable .",
    "this can be done by taking a value greater than the characteristic time scale of the system .",
    "@xmath47 must be chosen so that @xmath41 can be reliably computed .",
    "small variations in @xmath41 for the same input flow can be allowed since the flow is sensitive to actuation close to @xmath41 .",
    "longer checking and computation times ensure a more reliable but less responsive system .      to demonstrate the efficiency of the frequency - lock approach , the free - stream velocity is randomly varied .",
    "variations in @xmath43 ( based on @xmath51 ) are shown in figure  [ fig : u_check ] .",
    "to ensure strong variations in the kh frequency , a wide range of reynolds number is explored ( @xmath52 to @xmath53 ) .",
    "each time the reynolds number is changed , the kh frequency is evaluated , as shown on figure  [ fig : freq ] .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : a_recirculation ] shows the evolution of @xmath54 normalized by @xmath55 as a function of time .",
    "the mean value is also computed over each controlled phase ( red lines on figure  [ fig : a_recirculation ] ) . re - computation only occurs for major changes in @xmath51 .",
    "what constitutes major changes is up to the user . because shedding frequency is locked during control to actuation frequency , control is successful even when natural shedding frequency varies slightly .",
    "every large peaks in @xmath54 correspond to a re - computation of @xmath41 . as a consequence , each peak corresponds to the uncontrolled value associated to the new value of the reynolds number .",
    "when the flow is controlled , reduction in @xmath28 varies between 70 % to 85 % when compared to the uncontrolled value .",
    "these values are consistent with those found by @xcite in open - loop experiments .",
    "it clearly demonstrates the robustness of this control strategy based on frequency lock on a natural frequency estimated by real - time instantaneous optical measurements .",
    "the experimental study of a frequency lock algorithm was conducted on the separated flow behind a backward facing step .",
    "although basic in nature the control method is able to reliably lower recirculation area .",
    "the key is using velocity fields computed from optical data to identify vortex shedding frequency .",
    "the shear layer is then periodically excited at the computed frequency .",
    "a polling loop continuously checks for changes in the flow state allowing the control to adapt to a randomly changing reynolds number .",
    "few parameters are required for successful operation and method responsiveness and reliability can be easily and intuitively tweaked based on knowledge of the time scales involved in the relevant flow processes .",
