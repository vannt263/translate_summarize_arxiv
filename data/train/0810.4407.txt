    "it is known that in some cases light beams undergo transverse shifts ( tss ) after reflection and transmission at a plane interface of isotropic transparent media .",
    "two types of tss are known : the linear ts ( lts ) and the angular ts ( ats ) .",
    "the lts phenomenon means that the axis of the secondary beam is parallel to the plane of incidence , but it does not lie in it .",
    "this effect is connected with the transformation of the spin or intrinsic orbital angular momentum at reflection and transmission of the wave packet .",
    "the spin - dependent lts has been studied for more than half a century ( see , for instance , [ 1 - 13 ] and the references therein ) . in the case of total reflection , this effect is usually called the imbert - fedorov shift .",
    "the ltss of the reflected and transmitted beam , which depend on the intrinsic orbital angular momentum of the incident beam , have been predicted in [ 14 , 15 ] ; the experimental investigations of this and the associated effects have been carried out in [ 16 - 18 ] .",
    "the ats phenomenon means that the actual axis of the secondary beam is inclined to the plane of incidence , the value of the ats is given by the angle of inclination .",
    "like in the case of ltss , two types of atss are known : the spin - dependent and the spin - independent atss .",
    "the expression for the spin - dependent ats of the reflected beam has been obtained in the work by nasalski [ 9 ] .",
    "bliokh and bliokh [ 13 ] have performed explicit calculations of spin - dependent atss for both reflected and transmitted beams .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the possibility of these atss has been pointed out in [ 7 ] .",
    "spin - independent atss of the reflected and transmitted beams have been predicted in ref .",
    "[ 14 ] and in the papers by alda [ 19 ] and by alda and rico - garcia [ 20 ] .",
    "the ltss of the secondary beams are controlled by the conservation law of the normal - to - interface component of the minkowski angular momentum [ 21 - 24 ] , what is explained as follows .",
    "if the normal component of the total intrinsic angular momentum changes after reflection and transmission , the above - mentioned law demands that the centres of gravity of the secondary packets must undergo shifts in the transverse direction in order that the normal component of the total extrinsic am generated by the shifts could compensate this change . in application to the",
    "totally reflected beam , this fact was known long ago [ 3 ] . as for the ltss of partially reflected and transmitted beams , these phenomena have been especially intensively discussed from the point of view of the conservation laws in the last years [ 12 , 13 , 24 ] .    in this communication",
    ", it will be shown that the atss of the secondary beams are also controlled by a conservation law , namely by conservation of the transverse , i.e. perpendicular to the plane of incidence , component of the minkowski linear momentum .",
    "let us consider the reflection and transmission of a monochromatic light beam at a plane interface of two semi - infinite transparent , isotropic , nondispersive , and nonmagnetic media .",
    "the scheme of this process is shown in fig .",
    "the position of the interface is defined by the equation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the 3d radius vector , and @xmath2 is the unit normal to the interface directed from the first medium , which fills the upper half - space , to the second one .",
    "the beam is assumed to be incident from the first medium .",
    "let us denote the refractive indices of the media in the upper half - space ( @xmath3 ) and the lower half - space ( @xmath4 ) by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .    throughout this paper",
    ", we shall use the superscripts @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 for indicating the quantities characteristic of the incident , reflected and transmitted beams , respectively .",
    "the superscript @xmath10 will be used in order to designate an arbitrary ( incident , reflected or transmitted ) beam and the superscript @xmath11 in order to designate one of the secondary beams ( reflected or transmitted ) .",
    "thus , @xmath10=@xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 , and @xmath11=@xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "by @xmath12 the refractive index of the medium will be denoted , in which the @xmath10-th beam propagates , i.e. @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "we shall employ four coordinate systems .",
    "three systems are connected with the incident , reflected and transmitted beams .",
    "these systems will be termed the @xmath7- , @xmath8 , and @xmath9-systems , their bases are given by the unit vectors @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . in the @xmath7-system",
    ", the @xmath18 axis is assumed to coincide with the incident beam s axis ( the exact definition of the latter will be given later ) .",
    "this axis and the unit vector @xmath2 define the position of the beam s plane of incidence in 3d space ; the angle between the unit vectors @xmath2 and @xmath19 is the beam s angle of incidence : @xmath20 . the coordinate origin @xmath21 in every system is taken to be the point of intersection of the incident beam axis with the interface . in the @xmath8- and @xmath9-systems , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 axes are assumed to coincide with the geometric - optical axes of the reflected and transmitted beams .",
    "the geometric - optical axes of the secondary beams are defined as the rays which are intersected by the interface at the coordinate origin and whose directions are characterized by the unit vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 , these vectors being related to @xmath26 through the snell laws .",
    "the beam s angles of reflection and transmission @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the angles between the vector @xmath2 and the respective geometric optics axis .",
    "@xmath29 , while @xmath28 is defined by the relation @xmath30 .",
    "let us define the @xmath31 axis of every system to be perpendicular to the plane of incidence , this axis ( the transverse one ) is characterized by the unit vector @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 axes lie in the plane of incidence , the direction of the @xmath36 axis is given by the unit vector @xmath37 .    in the @xmath10-th system ,",
    "the 3d radius - vector is represented as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the 2d planar radius vectors lying in the planes which are perpendicular to the axis of the incident beam or to the geometric optics axes of the respective secondary beam : @xmath42    the fourth system is connected with the interface , its basis being given by the unit vectors @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "we shall assume that the incident beam is paraxial , i.e. that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the wavelength of the light in vacuum and @xmath48 is a mean dimension of the beam in the planar plane .",
    "let us denote the electric and magnetic field vectors of the @xmath10-th beam at the point @xmath49 by @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the vector @xmath52 will designate either @xmath50 or @xmath53 .",
    "the time dependence of the field vectors and of the other characteristics of the beams is suppressed .    in order to consider the ats phenomenon ,",
    "it is necessary to define the actual axes of the secondary beams .",
    "let us first define the centre of gravity of the @xmath10-th beam .",
    "its position on the beam s cross - section is given by the 2d vector @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath56-coordinate of the cross - section , and @xmath57 is the electromagnetic energy density inside the @xmath10-th beam , @xmath58 \\ ; .\\ ] ] atss are actual in the far - field region . in view of that , let us assume that every @xmath55 satisfies the condition : @xmath59 let us also assume that , if @xmath60 is close to @xmath61 or to @xmath62 , @xmath55 satisfy the additional condition : @xmath63 if the relation ( 6 ) is fulfilled , the electromagnetic fields of the beams are negligible at the lines of intersection of the respective cross - sections and the interface .",
    "again , the reflected field can be ignored on the cross - section of the incident beam and vice versa .    in the regions ( 5 ) , the geometrical loci of the centres of gravity of the incident , reflected and transmitted beams are the straight lines .",
    "let us define the first one to be the axis of the incident beam .",
    "the second and the third lines determine the actual axes of the secondary beams .",
    "these axes and the unit normal @xmath2 give the actual planes of reflection and transmission , the angles between them and the incidence plane will be denoted by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "let us define the atss of the reflected and transmitted beams , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , as the angles of the inclination of the beams actual axes to the incidence plane .",
    "the angles @xmath68 and @xmath69 are small [ 13 , 14 , 19 , 20 ] , thus , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in this case , the relation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 is as follows : @xmath72 the meanings of the angles @xmath66 and @xmath73 are illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , the meanings of the angles @xmath67 and @xmath65 are similar .    let us now consider the ats phenomenon from the point of view of the dynamics of the processes of the reflection and transmission of wave packets . in order to do that ,",
    "let us fix a time instant @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) and select at this instant a section of the incident beam , which is restricted with two cross - sections , the axial coordinate of its centre being equal to @xmath76 ( see fig .",
    "its length , i.e. the distance between the cross - sections , will be denoted by @xmath77 .",
    "let us impose the following restrictions on @xmath77 : @xmath78    being separated from the beam , the selected section represents a packet of electromagnetic waves .",
    "qualitatively , the process of propagation of the packet constructed in such a way is fig .",
    "3 . at the instant @xmath79 and during some interval after it ,",
    "the influence of the second medium on the incident field is negligible .",
    "thus , during this interval , the motion of the packet is quasi - free , i.e. it occurs as if the packet propagates in the homogeneous medium with the refracted index @xmath5 . at @xmath80 , the incident , reflected and transmitted fields coexist . finally , when @xmath81 is positive and large enough , the reflected and transmitted packets are well formed , and they propagate quasi - freely in the first and the second medium , respectively .",
    "further on , the time instants , when the motions of the packets are quasi - free , will be specified by means of the accent `` tilde '' over @xmath81 , these times obey the condition : @xmath82    let us now perform a detailed analysis of the motion of the constructed packet . further on , the same letters will be used for notations of field vectors and other characteristics of the @xmath10-th beam and of the @xmath10-th packet . however , in order to make the difference between the characteristics of the beam and of the packet , in the latter case the respective letter will be overlined . again ,",
    "when necessary , the dependence of the respective characteristics on @xmath81 will be explicitly pointed out .",
    "our analysis of the motion of the constructed packet will be based on the local energy - momentum conservation laws , which take place at an arbitrary @xmath83 .",
    "these laws can be written by means of the minkowski energy - momentum tensor @xmath84 [ 22 , 25 , 26 ] . in order to do this ,",
    "let us introduce the conception of a total electromagnetic field , whose characteristics will be written down without superscript @xmath10 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath85 and @xmath86 again , let us denote by @xmath87 the dielectric constant at an arbitrary point in the whole space : @xmath88 , if @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , if @xmath91 . then , in the coordinate system connected with the interface , @xmath84 will look as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the constituents of this tensor are as follows .",
    "@xmath95 is the electromagnetic energy density at an arbitrary point and at an arbitrary instant @xmath81 : @xmath96 \\ ; .\\ ] ] @xmath97 is the poynting vector : @xmath98 we use the system of units , in which the light velocity in vacuum is unity , in such a system @xmath99 coincides with the density of the linear momentum defined in the sense of abraham [ 22 , 25 , 26 ] .",
    "@xmath100 is the density of the linear momentum defined in the sense of minkowski [ 22 , 25 , 26 ] , in the employed system of units , @xmath101 @xmath102 is the maxwellian stress tensor : @xmath103 were @xmath104 is the kronecker symbol .    by means of the tensor @xmath84 the local conservation laws of the energy ( @xmath105 ) and of the components of the minkowski linear momentum ( @xmath106 ) are written as follows : @xmath107 eq .",
    "( 17 ) is correct in the whole space except the interface and at an arbitrary instant of time .",
    "this equation can be used as a basis for the description of the motion of the constructed packet at any @xmath81 .",
    "let us first consider quasi - free regimes .",
    "in these regimes , only one packet exits in the first medium , i.e. , in this medium , @xmath108 when @xmath109 , and @xmath110 when @xmath111 .",
    "let us take this fact into account and integrate eq .",
    "( 17 ) over the upper half - space if @xmath109 and over the upper and lower half - spaces separately if @xmath111 . at",
    "that let us take into account that @xmath112 is negligible on the interface ; thus , the integration over the respective half - space may be replaced by the integration over the whole space , and , as a consequence , the partial derivative @xmath113 in the left - hand side of the obtained expression may be replaced by the full one @xmath114 .",
    "then we obtain that the electromagnetic energy @xmath115 and the minkowski linear momentum @xmath116 of the @xmath10-th packet do not depend on @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath118 and @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the constants . again , by using the relation ( 15 ) we obtain that the linear momenta of the @xmath10-th packet defined in the senses of abraham and minkowski are related by @xmath122    let us now consider the 3d radius - vector of the centre of gravity of the @xmath10-th packet @xmath123 .",
    "it is defined as follows : @xmath124 the integration in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 21 ) being performed over the respective half - space .",
    "let us act by the operator @xmath113 on the left - hand and right - hand sides of eq .",
    "( 21 ) . in the right - hand side of the obtained expression ,",
    "let use the relation ( 17 ) with @xmath105 , and , by the calculation of the numerator , let us perform the integration by parts .",
    "in the left - hand side , the partial derivative @xmath125 may be replaced , due to the above reasoning , by the full one @xmath114 . after carrying out these operations , we obtain the following equation of the motion of the @xmath10-packet : @xmath126    thus , the motion of the @xmath10-th packet under condition ( 9 ) is rectilinear .",
    "let us impose the following restriction on @xmath127 : @xmath128 if @xmath117 satisfies the relation ( 23 ) , the vector @xmath112 approximately coincides with the vector @xmath129 inside the section of @xmath10-th beam , whose centre is situated at @xmath130 and whose length equals to @xmath131 . as a consequence , @xmath132 what means that , in the quasi - free regime , the centre of gravity of the @xmath7-th packet moves along the axis of the incident beam , while the centre of gravity of @xmath11-th packet moves along the @xmath11-th actual axis .",
    "thus , the angular shifts @xmath133 and @xmath134 are equal to the angles of inclination of the vectors @xmath135 and @xmath136 to the incidence plane .",
    "consider the properties of these vectors .",
    "let us begin with the zero - order approximation with respect to @xmath137 . in this approximation , the laws of reflection and transmission for the packet under consideration and for the plane wave , which is incident at the angle @xmath138 and whose polarization vector is @xmath139 , are equivalent .",
    "let us denote the characteristics of the secondary beams calculated in the zero - order approximation by means of the additional superscript @xmath61 .",
    "then we have : @xmath140 , were @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the reflectivity and transmissivity of the above - mentioned plane wave [ 25 , 27 ] . as for the vectors @xmath143 and @xmath144 , they are directed along the geometric optics axes of the reflected and transmitted beams , respectively : @xmath145 .",
    "the values @xmath146 are related to @xmath147 by @xmath148 .",
    "the @xmath149 and @xmath31 components of the vector @xmath150 are of a highest order . in the nearest - order approximation ,",
    "the former does not affect the angle of inclination of the vector @xmath150 to the incidence plane .",
    "thus , by using the above relations one obtains : @xmath151    eq .",
    "( 25 ) shows that from the point of view of the dynamics the calculation of the ats of the secondary beam @xmath68 turns to the calculation of the transverse linear momentum @xmath152 , which is obtained by the packet after the reflection or transmission . in order to carry out these calculations ,",
    "it is necessary to make an assumption about the structure of the incident beam .",
    "however , a relation between @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be obtained without any assumption .",
    "the derivation of this relation is carried out on the basis of the conservation law of the transverse component of the linear momentum defined in the sense of minkowski . in order to do that ,",
    "let us take @xmath153 in eq .",
    "( 17 ) and perform the integration of the left - hand and right - hand sides of this equation over the whole space ( @xmath81 is assumed to be arbitrary ) . by means of the gauss theorem ,",
    "the 3d right - hand integral transforms into two 2d integrals of @xmath154 over both sides of the interface . by taking into account the boundary conditions at the interface [ 25 , 27 ]",
    ", one can be convinced that @xmath154 is continuous at the interface ; as a consequence , the sum of the two above - mentioned surface integrals equals zero , therefore @xmath155 . at the instant @xmath79 , @xmath156 ,",
    "hence , @xmath157 at an arbitrary @xmath81 .",
    "let us now consider the secondary packets at a instant @xmath111 , when they are well - formed . at such an instant ,",
    "@xmath158 . hence , taking into account eq .",
    "( 19 ) , we get : @xmath159 . by using in this expression the relation between the quantities @xmath160 and @xmath161 given by eq . ( 20 ) , one obtains : @xmath162 thus , the reflected and transmitted beams separately can obtain transverse abraham linear momenta , however , their values must obey the condition ( 26 ) .",
    "substitution of the expression for @xmath163 obtained from eq .",
    "( 25 ) into eq .",
    "( 26 ) and the using of the relation ( 7 ) yields @xmath164 the relation between the atss of the reflected and transmitted beams , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , can be obtained from eq .",
    "( 27 ) by means of eq .",
    "it should be underlined that the relation ( 27 ) does not depend on the incident beam s structure .",
    "nevertheless , one can be convinced that the spin - dependent and the spin - independent atss , which have been calculated in refs . [ 13 ] and [ 14 , 19 , 20 ] , respectively , satisfy the relation ( 27 ) , although the values of these atss depend on the structure mentioned .",
    "the following conclusion can be made exclusively on the basis of the conservation law of the transverse component of the minkowski linear momentum .",
    "the ats phenomenon can take place only when both the reflected and transmitted beams are generated .",
    "independent of the incident beam s structure , the ats must be equal zero when one secondary beam is generated , i.e. when @xmath165 , and @xmath166 , or @xmath167 , and @xmath168 ; the former situation takes place when @xmath169 and @xmath170 exceeds the critical angle for the total reflection , the latter takes place when the incident beam is @xmath171-polarized and @xmath170 is equal to the brewster angle .",
    "\\1 . we have analyzed the atss of the secondary beams on the basis of conservation laws , which take place in the processes of reflection and transmission of a wave packet at a plane interface of two isotropic transparent media .",
    "it has been shown that the values of the atss of the reflected and transmitted beams , in case the shifts exist , are controlled by the conservation law of the transverse component of the minkowski linear momentum .",
    "owing to this law , the angles @xmath64 and @xmath65 must satisfy the relation ( 27 ) .",
    "the obtained relation ( 27 ) is of a general character : by its derivation , we have assumed that the incident beam is paraxial , but the distribution of the electromagnetic field inside the beam has not been specified .",
    "this fact is remarkable because the ats of every secondary beam depends on this distribution .",
    "\\3 . without direct calculations of the ats , only on the basis of the conservation of the transverse component of the minkowski linear momentum , one can conclude that the ats must be equal zero when only one secondary beam is generated , i.e. in the total - reflection and total - transmission regimes .",
    "our analysis was restricted with the processes of reflection and transmission of the light beam at a single interface of two isotropic transparent media . however",
    ", the conservation of the transverse component of the minkowski linear momentum takes also place when the beam is reflected and transmitted at the stratified structures of the isotropic transparent media .",
    "if in the course of such a process several well - divided reflected or transmitted beams are generated ( see , for instance , [ 28 ] ) , their atss must obey a condition similar to the relation ( 27 ) .",
