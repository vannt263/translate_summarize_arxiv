    "masaki izumi at the institute of mathematical sciences , chennai in march 2012 , during one of which he asserted that for a kac algebra subfactor , a related subfactor to its asymptotic inclusion comes from an outer action of its drinfeld double .",
    "this is a folklore result in subfactor theory and since we were unable to locate a precise reference , it seemed desirable to write down a formal proof .",
    "however , in the process of trying to prove this , we noticed a purely algebraic result that also seemed quite interesting and it is this algebraic result that is the focus of this paper ( rather than the original subfactor result , which involves more analysis and to which we hope to return in a future publication ) .",
    "one advantage of this algebraic approach is that it applies to hopf algebras that are not semisimple , in contrast to the analytic case .",
    "our main result is roughly the following . given a finite dimensional hopf algebra @xmath0 , we associate a certain natural inclusion of ( infinite - dimensional ) algebras @xmath1 to it and show that @xmath2 is the crossed product ( also known as the smash product in hopf algebra literature ) of @xmath3 by @xmath4 where @xmath4 is the drinfeld double of @xmath0 .",
    "more significantly , we show that @xmath4 is the only finite - dimensional hopf algebra with this property thus producing a context in which the drinfeld double arises very naturally .",
    "throughout this paper , we work over a fixed but arbitrary ground field @xmath5 .",
    "all algebras in this paper will be unital @xmath5-algebras and possibly infinite - dimensional .",

    "we denote elements of a tensor product as decomposable tensors with the understanding that there is an implied omitted summation ( just as in our simplified sweedler notation ) .",

    "given an action of @xmath0 on @xmath3 , we may define the crossed product algebra ( or the smash product algebra ) denoted @xmath22 ( or mostly , simply as @xmath23 , when the action is understood ) to be the algebra with underlying vector space @xmath24 ( where we denote @xmath25 by @xmath26 ) and multiplication defined by @xmath27 this is an algebra with unit @xmath28 and there are natural inclusions of algebras @xmath29 given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 given by @xmath32 .",
    "we note that while the crossed or smash product construction is a special case of one that involves , in addition , twisting by a 2-cocyle of @xmath0 , in this paper , it suffices to consider the case of the trivial cocycle , which is the one discussed above .",
    "borrowing terminology from subfactor theory , we define an inclusion @xmath1 of algebras to be irreducible if the relative commutant @xmath33 ( which is the centraliser algebra of @xmath3 in @xmath2 , also denoted by @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) is just @xmath36 , i.e. , if the only elements of @xmath2 that commute with all elements of @xmath3 are scalar multiples of its identity element .",
