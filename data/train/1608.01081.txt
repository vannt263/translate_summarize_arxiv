    "recently , non - orthogonal multiple access ( noma )  @xcite has been considered as a promising technique for fifth generation ( 5 g ) and beyond 5 g ( b5 g ) cellular networks .",
    "the key idea of noma is to simultaneously serve multiple users ( ideally all active users in a serving cell ) over same radio resources at the expense of minimal inter - user interference .",
    "noma not only allows serving individual users with higher effective bandwidth but also allows scheduling more users than the number of available resources .",
    "in contrast to conventional orthogonal multiple access ( oma ) , where every user is served on exclusively allocated radio resources , noma superposes the message signals of multiple users in power domain by exploiting their respective channel gain differences . successive interference cancellation ( sic ) is then applied at the receivers for multi - user detection and decoding . for example , in downlink noma , the base station ( bs ) schedules different users over same resources but their respective message signals are transmitted using different power levels . by exploiting the power differences , each user equipment ( ue ) can apply sic and in turn decode its desired signal .",
    "recently , numerous research activities have been initiated across the globe to identify the potential gains of noma in both the downlink and uplink transmissions . here",
    "we review the most recent and relevant research studies for uplink and downlink noma transmissions .",
    "the basic concept of noma was exploited in @xcite-@xcite for downlink transmissions .",
    "the authors in @xcite-@xcite proposed power domain user multiplexing at the bss and sic - based signal reception at ue terminals . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors discussed various practical challenges of noma systems , such as multi - user power allocation and user scheduling schemes , error propagation in sic , overall system overhead , user mobility , and the combination of noma with multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) .",
    "system - level and link - level simulations in @xcite indicated clear benefits of noma over oma in terms of overall system throughput as well as individual user s throughput . in @xcite ,",
    "closed - form expressions for ergodic sum - rate and outage probability were presented for two users considering static power allocations .",
    "the impact of user pairing was studied in @xcite for a two - user noma system .",
    "the authors proposed fixed and opportunistic user pairing schemes by statically allocating transmission powers among noma users . on the other hand ,",
    "the impact of power allocation on the fairness of the downlink noma was investigated in @xcite , considering perfect channel state information ( csi ) feedback as well as average csi feedback . in @xcite ,",
    "a cooperative noma system was studied , where the authors advocated the idea of pairing weak channel users with the strong channel users for cooperative data transmission .",
    "a test - bed for two - user noma system was presented in @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed by setting @xmath0 mhz bandwidth for noma users .",
    "the results were compared with those for a two - user oma system where each user has a transmission bandwidth of @xmath1 mhz  @xcite .",
    "the results showed significance of noma over oma in terms of aggregate as well as individual user s throughput .      for uplink transmissions ,",
    "noma was first investigated in @xcite where power control was applied at ue transmitter and minimum mean squared error ( mmse)-based sic decoding was utilized at bs receiver .",
    "a joint subcarrier and power allocation problem was studied in @xcite .",
    "specifically , a sub - optimal solution was designed to maximize the sum - rate of a noma cluster .",
    "closed - form expressions for sum - throughput and outage probability were derived for a two - user uplink noma system in @xcite assuming static powers of different users .",
    "the authors in @xcite also compared their results with tdma - based oma system and concluded that without proper selection of target data rate for each noma user , a user can always be in outage .",
    "this conclusion was also mentioned in @xcite for downlink noma .",
    "apart from these , a robust user scheduling algorithm for uplink noma with sc - fdma was designed in @xcite , where the distinct channel gains of different users were exploited to obtain efficient user grouping .      for both uplink and downlink noma systems , efficient user clustering and power allocation among users are the most fundamental design issues . to date ,",
    "most of the research investigations have been conducted either for downlink or for uplink scenario while considering two users in the system with fixed power allocations .",
    "in particular , * there is no comprehensive investigation to precisely analyze the differences in uplink and downlink noma systems and their respective impact on the user grouping and power allocation problems*. in this context , this paper focuses on developing efficient user clustering and power allocation solutions for multi - user uplink and downlink noma systems .",
    "the contributions of this paper are outlined as follows :    * we briefly review and describe the differences in the working principles of uplink and downlink noma .",
    "* for both uplink and downlink noma , we formulate cell - throughput maximization problem such that user grouping and power allocations in noma cluster(s ) can be optimized under transmission power constraints , minimum rate requirements of the users , and sic constraints . * due to the combinatorial nature of the formulated mixed integer non - linear programming ( minlp ) problem , we propose a low - complexity sub - optimal user grouping scheme .",
    "the proposed scheme exploits the channel gain differences among users in a noma cluster and group them either in a single cluster or multiple clusters to enhance the sum throughput of the uplink and downlink noma systems .",
    "* for a given set of noma clusters , we derive optimal power allocation that maximizes the sum throughput of all users in a cluster and in turn maximizes the overall system throughput . using kkt optimality conditions , for both uplink and downlink noma",
    ", we derive closed - form optimal power allocations for any cluster size . *",
    "we evaluate the performances of different uplink and downlink noma systems using the proposed user grouping and power allocation solutions .",
    "numerical results compare the performance of noma over oma and illustrate the significance of noma in various network scenarios .",
    "important guidelines related to the key design factors of noma systems are obtained .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section ii discusses the fundamentals of downlink and uplink noma systems .",
    "iii presents the system model , assumptions , and the joint problem formulation for optimal user clustering and power allocation in noma systems .",
    "section  iv and section  v , respectively , discuss the proposed sub - optimal user clustering solution and the optimal power allocation solutions for uplink and downlink noma systems .",
    "section vi evaluates the performance of the proposed solutions numerically and section  vii concludes the article .",
    "in this section , we discuss the basic concepts of downlink and uplink noma considering @xmath2 users with distinct channel gains in a cluster .",
    "the power domain multiplexing is applied to superpose multiple signals , whereas an sic mechanism is applied at the receiver(s ) to decode the superposed signals .",
    "let us consider a general @xmath2-user downlink noma system , where all users experience distinct channel gains . in @xmath2-user downlink noma , a single transmitter ( i.e. , bs ) non - orthogonally transmits @xmath2 different signals over the same radio resources ; whereas , all @xmath2 receivers ( i.e. , ues ) receive their desired signals along with the interferences caused by the messages of other ues . to obtain the desired signal ,",
    "each sic receiver first decodes the dominant interferences and then subtracts them from the superposed signal",
    ". therefore , the received signal strength of the interference signals needs to be sufficiently higher in comparison to the desired signal in order to cancel them by sic processing at the receiver end .",
    "since each ue receives all signals ( desired and interfering signals ) over the same radio spectrum ( i.e. , channel ) , multiplexing of different signals with different power levels is crucial to diversify each signal and to perform sic at a given ue receiver .    in downlink noma",
    ", the messages of high channel gain users are transmitted with low power levels whereas the messages of low channel gain users are transmitted with high power levels . as such , at a given receiver , the strong interfering signals are mainly due to the information of low channel gain users .",
    "the weakest channel user ( who receives low interferences due to relatively low powers of the messages of high channel gain users ) can not suppress any interferences .",
    "however , the highest channel gain user ( who receives strong interferences due to relatively high powers of the messages of low channel gain users ) can suppress all interfering signals .",

    "if @xmath16 , then @xmath7 can perform sic to cancel interference from both @xmath8 and @xmath9 , whereas @xmath8 can only cancel interference from @xmath9 .",
    "also , @xmath9 experiences interference from both @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but can not cancel any of them . therefore , the achievable throughput for @xmath17 , in a @xmath3-user downlink noma cluster can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the normalized channel gain with @xmath20 being the noise power , @xmath21 is the number of radio channels ( e.g. , resource blocks in an lte / lte - a system ) assigned for the cluster , @xmath22 is the transmission bandwidth of each channel ( e.g. , resource block ) .    to perform sic , transmission power for each noma",
    "user needs to be selected properly .",
    "if @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the transmission powers for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively , then the power allocations need to satisfy the following conditions for efficient sic at @xmath7 receiver : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the downlink power budget for this @xmath3-user noma cluster , and @xmath29 is the minimum power difference needed to distinguish between the signal to be decoded and the remaining non - decoded message signals . and represent the power allocation conditions to cancel interference of @xmath9 and @xmath8 , respectively , at @xmath7 receiver .    from and , it is evident that the transmit power for any user must be the greater than sum transmit power for all users with relatively stronger channel gains .",
    "that is , the transmit power for @xmath9 must be greater than the sum transmit power for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while the transmit power for @xmath8 needs to be greater the transmit power for @xmath7 .",
    "subsequently , the power allocation condition to cancel the interference of @xmath9 at @xmath8 receiver can be given as @xmath30 note that , since @xmath31 , is automatically satisfied if holds .",
    "therefore , the necessary power constraints for efficient sic in a @xmath3-user cluster can be given by and .",
    "based on the above illustration , the necessary power constraints for efficient sic in an @xmath2-user noma cluster can be expressed as follows : @xmath32 consequently , an important conclusion about the transmit power of highest channel gain user in a noma cluster can be derived as given in the following .",
    "the maximum transmission power allocation to the highest channel gain user in the downlink noma cluster must be smaller than @xmath33 , where @xmath2 is the number of users in the cluster and @xmath28 is the total transmission power budget for the given noma cluster .",
    "the proof follows by induction .",
    "let us consider a @xmath34-user downlink noma cluster where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the normalized channel gains of the high and low channel gain users , respectively .",
    "as per the sic constraints in , we have @xmath37 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the allocated powers for high and low channel users , respectively .",
    "the maximum allocated power to the highest channel gain user can thus be derived as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the minimum power difference needed for sic . note that the value of @xmath40 can be very small when the value of @xmath35 is very high , which is usually the case .",
    "similarly , for @xmath3-user downlink noma cluster , the maximum allocated transmit powers for second higher and highest channel gain user can be expressed , respectively , as @xmath41 consequently , for an @xmath2-user cluster , we have @xmath42 this is the same result as given in * lemma  1*.      the operation of uplink noma is quite different from that of downlink noma . in uplink noma , multiple transmitters ( ues )",
    "non - orthogonally transmit to a single receiver ( bs ) on the same radio spectrum ( i.e. , channel ) .",
    "each ue independently transmits its own signal at either maximum transmit power or controlled transmit power .",
    "all received signals at the bs are the desired signals , although they cause interference to each other .",
    "since the transmitters are different , each received signal at sic receiver ( i.e. , the bs ) experiences distinct channel gain .",
    "note that , to apply sic and decode signals at bs , we need to maintain the distinctness among various message signals .",
    "as such , conventional transmit power control ( typically intended to equalize the received signal powers of all users ) may not be feasible in noma - based systems .",
    "let us consider a general @xmath2-user uplink noma system in which @xmath2 users transmit to a common bs over the same radio channel , at either maximum transmit power or controlled transmit power .",
    "the bs receives the superposed message signal of @xmath2 different users and applies sic to decode each signal .",
    "since the received signal from the highest channel gain user is likely the strongest at the bs ; therefore , this signal is decoded first . consequently ,",
    "the highest channel gain user experiences interference from all other users in the cluster .",
    "then , the signal for second highest channel gain user is decoded and so on . as a result , the highest channel gain user experiences interference from all users and",
    "the lowest channel gain user enjoys interference - free data rate .",

    ", the user s signal with the highest channel gain is decoded first at the bs .",
    "thus , the achievable data rate of @xmath7 depends on the interference from @xmath8 and @xmath9 , whereas @xmath9 achieves interference free data rate .",
    "the data rate of @xmath8 depends on the interference from @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the achievable data rate ( or throughput ) for @xmath17 , in a @xmath3-user uplink noma cluster can be expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath22 are defined similarly as in downlink noma .",
    "if @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the transmission powers of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively , then the following conditions need to be satisfied for efficient sic at bs , i.e. , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the maximum transmit power budget of each ue . and represent the necessary conditions for efficient decoding of @xmath7 and @xmath8 signals , respectively , prior to decoding the signal of @xmath9 .    based on the above example , the necessary power constraints for efficient sic , in an @xmath2-user uplink noma cluster can be expressed as follows : @xmath48",
    "we consider a macro base station ( bs ) serving @xmath49 uniformly distributed ues for uplink as well as downlink .",
    "the bs and each of the ues use a single antenna configuration .",
    "the available system bandwidth @xmath50 is divided into frequency resource blocks , each of bandwidth @xmath22 .",
    "that is , the total number of frequency resource blocks are given as @xmath51 .",
    "users who are non - orthogonally scheduled over the same resource blocks form a noma cluster",
    ". however , each noma cluster operates on orthogonal frequency resource blocks . the number of users per noma cluster is represented by @xmath2 which ranges from @xmath52 .",
    "also , the resource blocks allocated per cluster are represented by @xmath21 , where @xmath53 .",
    "provided the range of @xmath2 , the number of clusters can vary between 1 and @xmath54 .",
    "the maximum bs transmission power budget is @xmath55 , the maximum transmission power budget per downlink noma cluster is @xmath28 , and the maximum user transmit power is @xmath47 . the normalized channel gain between @xmath56-th ue and the bs is represented by @xmath57 which accounts for both distance - based path - loss and shadowing .",
    "the users are sorted according to the descending order of their normalized channel gains as @xmath58 .",
    "now , let us define a variable @xmath59 as follows : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the joint user clustering ( i.e. , grouping of users into clusters ) and power allocation problem for the throughput maximization in downlink noma can be formulated as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the minimum data rate requirement for @xmath56-th user .",
    "the * constraint @xmath65 * denotes the total power constraint of the bs , * constraint @xmath66 * ensures the minimum downlink data rate requirements of the users , * constraint @xmath67 * denotes the sic constraints as discussed in section  ii.a , * constraint @xmath68 * ensures that one user can be assigned to at most one cluster , while at least two users are grouped into each downlink noma cluster , * constraint @xmath69 * provides the total downlink frequency resource constraint .",
    "in addition , * constraint @xmath70 * and @xmath71 demonstrate that @xmath21 and @xmath72 are integer variables .",
    "similarly , the joint user clustering and power allocation problem for throughput maximization of an uplink noma system can be formulated as follows : @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the minimum uplink data rate requirement for @xmath56-th user .",
    "* constraint @xmath76 * ensures the minimum rate requirements of the users , * constraint @xmath77 * ensures the minimum uplink data rate requirements of the users , * constraint @xmath78 * ensures the sic constraint as discussed in section  ii.b , and * constraints @xmath79 * are same as defined in section  iii.b .",
    "as can be seen , the formulated problems are mixed integer non - linear programming ( minlp ) problems whose solution is combinatorial by nature .",
    "specifically , for throughput maximization , the optimal user clustering solution requires an exhaustive search to form a noma cluster  @xcite .",
    "that is , for every single user , we need to consider all possible combinations of user grouping .",
    "for example , let us consider an uplink / downlink noma system with @xmath49 users .",
    "in such a system , the number of possible combinations for optimal user clustering , can be expressed as follows : @xmath80 evidently , the computational complexity of optimal user clustering may not be affordable for practical systems with a large number of active users . as such , we resort to solve the problem in two steps , i.e. , by developing a less complex solution for grouping users into different noma clusters and then optimizing their respective powers to maximize the sum throughput per cluster .",
    "subsequently , section  iv details the proposed low - complexity user clustering scheme . given the user clustering ,",
    "we derive optimal power allocations for users in section  v.",
    "in this section , we propose a low - complexity sub - optimal user clustering scheme for both uplink and downlink noma systems .",
    "the proposed scheme exploits the channel gain differences among users and aims at enhancing the sum - throughput of the considered cell .",
    "prior to user grouping , this scheme relies on selecting a feasible number of clusters , i.e. , decides the number of clusters and in turn the number of users per cluster .",
    "once the number of users in a cluster is decided , user grouping is performed . in the following",
    ", the key concepts of our proposed user paring policies and their algorithmic presentation are detailed .",
    "let us consider an @xmath2-user downlink noma cluster to which @xmath21 units of resource blocks are allocated .",
    "for such a system , the achievable per - user throughput in ( [ ugdl2 ] ) , where @xmath81 , provides necessary insights to group users into a cluster .",
    "these insights are discussed below :    * after sic , the throughput of the highest channel gain user in a cluster is not subject to the intra - cluster interference ; instead , its throughput depends on its own channel gain and power .",
    "although the allocated transmit power for the highest channel gain user is low ( as also mentioned in section  ii.a ) , its impact on the throughput is minimal .",
    "subsequently , if the gain of the highest channel is sufficiently high , then the achievable data rate negligibly depends on the transmission power , unless the power is very low .",
    "thus it is beneficial to distribute the high channel gain users in a cell into different noma clusters , as they can significantly contribute to the sum - throughput of a cluster . * to increase the throughput of the users with low channel gains , it is useful to pair them with the high channel gain users .",
    "the reason is that the high channel gain users can achieve a higher rate even with the low power levels while making the large fraction of power available for weak channel users . as such",
    ", the key point of our proposed user clustering in downlink noma is to pair the highest channel gain user and the lowest channel gain user into same noma cluster , while the second highest channel gain user and the second lowest channel gain user into another noma cluster , and so on . *",
    "the throughput of the remaining users in a noma cluster follows the same format .",
    "that is , the sinr contains same channel in both the denominator and numerator , whereas the transmit power in the numerator is greater than the sum power in the denominator ( this is given by the sic constraint ) . as such , the throughput of the remaining users in a noma cluster depends mainly on the distribution of the transmit power levels .",
    "let us consider an @xmath2-user uplink noma cluster to which @xmath21 units of resources are allocated .",
    "for such a system , the achievable per - user throughput in ( [ ugul1 ] ) , where @xmath81 , provides necessary insights to group users .",
    "these insights are discussed below :    * in an uplink noma cluster , all users signals experience distinct channel gains . to perform sic at bs , we need to maintain the distinctness of received signals .",
    "as such , the conventional transmit power control may not be feasible in a noma cluster .",
    "further , contrary to downlink noma , the power control at any user does nt increase the power budget for any other user in a cluster .",
    "as such , the ultimate result of power control is sum - throughput degradation . *",
    "the distinctness among the channels of different users within a noma cluster is crucial to minimize inter - user interference and thus to maximize the cluster throughput . * in uplink noma",
    ", the highest channel gain user does not interfere to weak channel users ( actually his interference is canceled by sic ) .",
    "therefore , this user can transmit with maximum power to achieve a higher throughput .",
    "it is thus beneficial to include the high channel gain users transmitting with maximum powers in each noma cluster , as they can significantly contribute to the throughput of a cluster .",
    "based on the above discussions , let we classify the users into two classes : class - a and class - b .",
