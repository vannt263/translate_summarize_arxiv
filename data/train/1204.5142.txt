    "the present paper deals with some asymptotic properties of fragmentation processes with immigration . random fragmentations with immigrations were introduced in @xcite , where also the deterministic setting was considered .",
    "the model this paper is concerned with consists of the interplay of two independent random actions with opposing effects . on the one hand",
    "there is the fragmentation of the blocks present in the system , which increases the number of blocks but may decrease the total mass in the system . on the other hand ,",
    "new blocks immigrate into the system and increase the number of blocks as well as the total size of all the blocks present in the system . in @xcite haas investigated the existence and uniqueness of a stationary distribution for fragmentation processes with immigration . in this model",
    "the immigration and the fragmentation events are described by independent poisson point processes .",
    "more precisely , at each time at which the immigration poisson point process has an atom at most countably many fragmentation processes immigrate into the system .",
    "each immigrated block then evolves as a fragmentation process ( cf .",
    "section  [ s.hfp ] ) , that is it fragments into a collection of smaller block according to a poisson point processes which is independent of the immigration poisson point processes and independent of the fragmentation of the other blocks .",
    "note that the total number of blocks remains at most countably infinite but the total size may be unbounded . in particular , by not taking the times of immigration into account , fragmentations with immigration can be considered as fragmentation processes whose total mass is finite at every time but not bounded by a constant . in this paper we extend the main results of @xcite and @xcite to fragmentation processes with immigration .",
    "that is to say , the goal we are concerned with is tantamount to showing that in a certain manner the limiting behaviour of the whole system is the same as taking the limit of the object under consideration for each immigrating block separately and putting these limits together .    in the setting with immigration",
    "we prove for bounded , deterministic functions the almost sure convergence of the empirical mean that is defined via a fragmentation process with immigration which is stopped at the stopping line of first passage times below a given block - size . in the setting of fragmentation chains ( without immigration )",
    "this kind of problem was considered in @xcite as well as @xcite and we shall resort to @xcite where the corresponding strong law of large numbers was obtained for general fragmentation processes without immigration .",
    "moreover , we prove the convergence of the so - called process counted with a random characteristic .",
    "random characteristics were considered by various authors for general branching processes and in the context of fragmentation processes they were introduced in @xcite . as for applications of such processes counted with a random characteristic for fragmentation processes we refer for instance to @xcite , where convergence results for the fragmentation energy model were established .",
    "a similar motivation as for the abovementioned extensions to the setting with immigration lies at the heart of theorem  4.2 in @xcite , where olofsson extends an @xmath1-convergence result that was obtained for crump - mode - jagers processes in @xcite to such processes with immigration .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for a result on supercritical immigration - branching processes in the spirit of this paper .",
    "the final result of this paper is concerned with the asymptotic decay of the largest block in the process with immigration .",
    "we give bounds on the exponential decay rate , where the upper bound depends on the time at which large blocks immigrate .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce fragmentation processes and such processes stopped at a particular family of stopping lines .",
    "the third section aims at providing some motivation for the topic of this paper by describing the problems under consideration in the setting without immigration .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ s.setup ] we establish the set - up for fragmentations with immigration and state the main results of this paper .",
    "section  [ s.example ] deals with an example of a fragmentation process with immigration that is based on the spine - decomposition of a fragmentation process .",
    "the last three sections are concerned with the proofs of our main results .    throughout this paper",
    "we consider a probability space @xmath2 on which the fragmentation processes as well as all the other random objects are defined .",
    "in this section we provide a brief introduction to fragmentation processes and associated processes that are stopped at certain stopping lines .",
    "moreover , we introduce two families of additive martingales that we shall need later on .",
    "we shall consider two closely related classes of fragmentation processes , namely partition - valued fragmentations and mass fragmentations , respectively .",
    "let us start by defining the state space of the partition - valued processes . to this end , let @xmath3 be the space of partitions @xmath4 of @xmath5 , where the blocks of @xmath6 are ordered by their least element such that @xmath7 if @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",

    "it is known from @xcite that the distribution of @xmath14 is determined by some @xmath15 ( the index of self - similarity ; @xmath16 corresponding to the homogeneous case ) , a constant @xmath17 ( the rate of erosion ) and a measure @xmath18 ( the so - called dislocation measure that determines the jumps of @xmath14 ) on @xmath19 such that @xmath20 as well as @xmath21 the measure @xmath18 is said to be _ conservative _ if @xmath22 , i.e. if there is no loss of mass by sudden dislocations , and _ dissipative _ otherwise . in this paper",

    "the main property of fragmentation processes is the _ ( strong ) fragmentation property _ , which is the analogue of the branching property of branching processes .",
