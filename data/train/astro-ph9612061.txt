    "recent gamma ray and cosmic ray observations give increasing evidence that the sources of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and of cosmic rays with energy @xmath0 are cosmological ( see @xcite for grbs ; [ 25 ] for cosmic rays ) .",
    "the sources of both phenomena , however , remain unknown . in particular , most of the cosmic ray sources discussed so far have difficulties in accelerating cosmic rays up to the highest observed energies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the arrival directions of the few cosmic rays detected above @xmath1 are inconsistent with the position of any astrophysical object that is likely to produce high energy particles @xcite , since the distance traveled by such particles must be smaller than @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "although the source of grbs is unknown , their observational characteristics impose strong constraints on the physical conditions in the @xmath3-ray emitting region @xcite , which imply that protons may be accelerated by fermi s mechanism in this region to energies @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the observed energy spectrum of cosmic rays above @xmath5 ( uhecrs ) is consistent with a cosmological distribution of sources of protons with a power - law generation spectrum typical of fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the average rate ( over volume and time ) at which energy is emitted as @xmath3-rays by grbs and in uhecrs in the cosmological scenario is , remarkably , comparable @xcite .",
    "these facts suggest that grbs and uhecrs have a common origin .",
    "we describe the grb model for uhecrs in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fermi ] , and discuss the current observational evidence which support it in sec .",
    "[ subsec : spec ] .",
    "several predictions of the model are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : pred ] .",
    "[ sec : conc ] contains a discussion .",
    "whatever the ultimate source of grbs is , observations strongly suggest the following similar scenario for the production of the bursts @xcite . the rapid rise time ,",
    "@xmath6 , observed in some bursts implies that the sources are compact , with a linear scale @xmath7 .",
    "the high luminosity required for cosmological bursts , @xmath8 , then results in an initially optically thick ( to pair creation ) plasma of photons , electrons and positrons , which expands and accelerates to relativistic velocities .",
    "in fact , the hardness of the observed photon spectra , which extends to @xmath9 , implies that the @xmath3-ray emitting region must be moving relativistically , with a lorentz factor @xmath3 of order a few hundreds .",
    "if the observed radiation is due to photons escaping the expanding `` wind '' as it becomes optically thin , two problems arise .",
    "first , the photon spectrum is quasi - thermal , in contrast with observations .",
    "second , the plasma is expected to be `` loaded '' with baryons which may be injected with the radiation or present in the atmosphere surrounding the source .",
    "a small baryonic load , @xmath10 , increases the optical depth ( due to thomson scattering ) so that most of the radiation energy is converted to kinetic energy of the relativistically expanding baryons before the plasma becomes optically thin . to overcome both problems",
    ", it was suggested that the observed burst is produced once the kinetic energy of the ultra - relativistic ejecta is dissipated , due to collision of the relativistic baryons with the inter - stellar medium or due to internal collisions within the ejecta , at large radius @xmath11 beyond the thomson photosphere , and then radiated as @xmath3-rays @xcite .    since @xmath12 , substantial dissipation of kinetic energy at @xmath13 implies that the random motions in the wind rest frame are ( at least mildly ) relativistic .",
    "the relativistic random motions are likely to give rise to a turbulent build up of magnetic fields , and therefore to fermi acceleration of charged particles .",
    "we derive below the constraints that should be satisfied by the wind parameters in order to allow acceleration of protons at the dissipation region to @xmath14 .",
    "the most restrictive requirement , which rules out the possibility of accelerating particles to energies @xmath14 in most astrophysical objects , is that the particle larmor radius @xmath15 should be smaller than the system size @xcite . in our scenario",
    "we must apply a more stringent requirement . due to",
    "the wind expansion the internal energy is decreasing and therefore available for proton acceleration ( as well as for @xmath3-ray production ) only over a comoving time @xmath16 .",
    "the typical fermi acceleration time is @xmath17 @xcite , leading to the requirement @xmath18 .",
    "this condition sets a lower limit for the required comoving magnetic field strength @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the wind luminosity , and @xmath23 is the equipartition field , i.e. a field with comoving energy density similar to that associated with the random energy of the baryons .",
    "the accelerated proton energy is also limited by energy loss due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "the condition that the synchrotron loss time should be smaller than the acceleration time is @xmath24 since the equipartition field is inversely proportional to the radius @xmath25 , this condition may be satisfied simultaneously with ( [ larmor ] ) provided that the dissipation radius is large enough , i.e. @xmath26 the high energy protons lose energy also in interaction with the wind photons ( mainly through pion production ) .",
    "it can be shown , however , that this energy loss is less important than the synchrotron energy loss @xcite .",
    "the conditions ( [ larmor]-[dis ] ) imply , that a dissipative ultra - relativistic wind , with luminosity and bulk lorentz factor implied by grb observations , satisfies the constraints necessary to allow the acceleration of protons to energies @xmath14 by second order fermi acceleration , provided that turbulent build up of magnetic fields during dissipation gives rise to fields which are close to equipartition .",
    "it should be noted that equipartition field is also required in most of the dissipative relativistic wind models for grbs .",
    "gamma - rays are produced in these models by synchrotron and synchro - self compton radiation of relativistic electrons produced by the dissipation shocks .",
    "equipartition field is required in this case to allow efficient radiation of the electrons @xcite .",
    "although the details of the mechanism of turbulent build up of an equipartition field are not fully understood , it seems to operate in a variety of astrophysical systems .",
    "we note that a magnetic field of this strength may exist in the plasma prior to the onset of internal collisions if a substantial part of the wind luminosity is initially , i.e. at @xmath27 , provided by magnetic field energy density , and if the field becomes predominantly transverse .",
    "the pre - existing field may suppress small scale turbulent motions . in this case",
    "shocks coherent over a scale @xmath28 would exist and protons would be accelerated by first rather than second order fermi mechanism .",
    "the constraints ( [ larmor]-[dis ] ) are valid in this case too , therefore leaving the above conclusions unchanged .      in the grb model for uhecr production described above , the high energy cosmic rays are protons accelerated by fermi s mechanism in sources that are distributed throughout the universe . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we compare the uhecr spectrum , reported by the fly s eye and the agasa experiments @xcite , with that expected from a homogeneous cosmological distribution of sources , each generating a power law differential spectrum of high energy protons @xmath29 , as typically expected from fermi acceleration ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "( for this calculation we have used a flat universe with zero cosmological constant and @xmath30 ; the spectrum is insensitive to the cosmological parameters and to source evolution , since most of the cosmic rays arrive from distances @xmath31 ) .",
    "the agasa flux at @xmath32 is @xmath33 times higher than that reported by the fly s eye , corresponding to a systematic @xmath34 larger estimate of event energies in the agasa experiment compared to the fly s eye experiment ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have therefore multiplied in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the fly s eye energy by @xmath35 and the agasa energy by @xmath36 .",
    "et al . _ @xcite find that the fly s eye flux in the energy range @xmath37 can be fitted by a sum of two power laws : a steeper galactic component with @xmath38 dominating at lower energy , and a shallower extra - galactic component with @xmath39 dominating at higher energy .",
    "_ fit to the extra - galactic component is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    the data are consistent with the cosmological model for @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , the flux predicted by the model at lower energy is consistent with the bird _",
    "_ fit to the extra - galactic component .",
    "( the flux deduced from the highest energy event in the fly s eye data is significantly higher than that predicted from the cosmological model .",
    "however , the statistical significance of the apparent discrepancy is not high : for the fly s eye exposure , the model predicts an average of @xmath41 events above @xmath1 , and the probability that the first event observed at this energy range is above @xmath42 is @xmath43 . )",
    "the deficit in the number of events detected above @xmath44 , compared to a power - law extrapolation of the flux at lower energy , is consistent with that expected due to a cosmological `` black - body cutoff '' . however , with current data the `` cutoff '' is detected with only @xmath45 significance .    the present rate at which energy should be produced as @xmath46@xmath47 protons by the cosmological cosmic ray sources in order to produce the observed flux is @xmath48 .",
    "this rate is comparable to that produced in @xmath3-rays by cosmological grbs : the rate of cosmological grb events is @xmath49 @xcite , each producing @xmath50 , corresponding to a @xmath3-ray energy production rate of @xmath51 .",
    "the above analysis implies that the grb model of uhecr production would produce uhecr flux consistent with that observed , provided the efficiency with which the wind kinetic energy is converted to @xmath3-ray and uhecr energy is similar .",
    "there is , however , one additional point which requires consideration .",
    "the energy of the most energetic cosmic ray detected by the fly s eye experiment is in excess of @xmath42 , and that of the most energetic agasa event is above @xmath1 . on a cosmological scale ,",
    "the distance traveled by such energetic particles is small : @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) for the agasa ( fly s eye ) event ( e.g. , @xcite ) . thus , the detection of these events over a @xmath54 period can be reconciled with the rate of nearby grbs , @xmath55 per @xmath56 in the field of view of the cr experiments out to @xmath57 in a standard cosmological scenario @xcite , only if there is a large dispersion , @xmath58 , in the arrival time of protons produced in a single burst ( this implies that if a direct correlation between high energy cr events and grbs , as recently suggested in @xcite , is observed on a @xmath59 time scale , it would be strong evidence _ against _ a cosmological grb hypothesis ) .",
    "the required dispersion is likely to occur due to the combined effects of deflection by random magnetic fields and energy dispersion of the particles .",
    "consider a proton of energy @xmath60 propagating through a magnetic field of strength @xmath61 and correlation length @xmath62 . as it travels a distance @xmath62 , the proton is typically deflected by an angle @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the larmor radius .",
    "the typical deflection angle for propagation over a distance @xmath65 is @xmath66 .",
    "this deflection results in a time delay , compared to propagation along a straight line , of order @xmath67 .",
    "the random energy loss uhecrs suffer as they propagate , owing to the production of pions , implies that at any distance from the observer there is some finite spread in the energies of uhecrs that are observed with a given fixed energy . for protons with energies",
    "@xmath68 the fractional rms energy spread is of order unity over propagation distances in the range @xmath69 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since the time delay is sensitive to the particle energy , this implies that the spread in arrival time of uhecrs with given observed energy is comparable to the average time delay at that energy @xmath70 . the field required to produce @xmath71 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "the required field is consistent with the current upper limit for the inter - galactic magnetic field , @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "a time broadening over @xmath75 is therefore possible .",
    "it should be noted , that a grb producing @xmath76 in uhecrs at @xmath53 distance , would produce a total fluence at earth of @xmath77 cosmic rays above @xmath78 per @xmath79 . in the presence of a magnetic field induced time delay ,",
    "the typical distance @xmath80 to the brightest source observed over an energy range @xmath81 around @xmath60 , with @xmath82 , is the radius of a sphere within which the average time between bursts is equal to the characteristic time delay @xmath83 $ ] ; i.e. @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the brightest source distance is @xmath85 and its flux is @xmath86 per @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath88 .",
    "the initial proton energy , necessary to have an observed energy @xmath60 , increases with source distance due to propagation energy losses .",
    "the rapid increase of the initial energy after it exceeds , due to electron - positron production , the threshold for pion production effectively results in a cutoff distance , @xmath89 , beyond which sources do not contribute to the flux above @xmath60 . since @xmath89 is a decreasing function of @xmath60 , for a given number density of sources",
    "there is a critical energy @xmath90 , above which only one source ( on average ) contributes to the flux . for bursting sources , @xmath90 depends on the product of the burst rate @xmath91 and the time delay . in the grb model , the burst rate",
    "is given by the grb rate @xmath92 , which is determined from the grb flux distribution .",
    "the time delay depends on the unknown properties of the intergalactic magnetic field , @xmath93 .",
    "however , the rapid decrease of @xmath89 with energy near @xmath1 implies that @xmath90 is not very sensitive to the unknown value of @xmath94 . for the range allowed for the grb model , @xmath95 ( the lower limit determined by ( [ bmin ] ) , and the upper limit by faraday rotation observations @xcite ) , the allowed range of @xmath90 is @xmath96 .",
    "[ fignc ] presents the flux obtained in one realization of a monte - carlo simulation described in ref .",
    "@xcite of the total number of uhecrs received from grbs at some fixed time . for each realization the positions ( distances from earth ) and times at which cosmological grbs occurred were randomly drawn , assuming an average rate @xmath97 , an intrinsic generation spectrum @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",

    "[ fignc ] when the brightest source of this realization ( dominating at @xmath1 ) is not included . at @xmath100 ,",
    "the number of sources contributing to the flux is very large , and the overall uhecr flux received at any given time is near the average ( the average flux is that obtained when the uhecr emissivity is spatially uniform and time independent ) . at @xmath101",
    ", the flux will generally be much lower than the average , because there will be no burst within a distance @xmath89 having taken place sufficiently recently .",
    "there is , however , a significant probability to observe one source with a flux higher than the average . a source similar to the brightest one in fig . [ fignc ] appears @xmath102 of the time .    at any fixed time",
    "a given burst is observed in uhecrs only over a narrow range of energy , because if a burst is currently observed at some energy @xmath60 then uhecrs of much lower energy from this burst have not yet arrived , while higher energy uhecrs reached us mostly in the past . as mentioned above , for energies above the pion production threshold , @xmath103 , the dispersion in arrival times of uhecrs with fixed observed",
    "energy is comparable to the average delay at that energy .",
    "this implies that the spectral width @xmath81 of the source at a given time is of order the average observed energy , @xmath104 .",
    "thus , bursting uhecr sources should have narrowly peaked energy spectra , and the brightest sources should be different at different energies . for steady state sources , on the other hand , the brightest source at high energies should also be the brightest one at low energies , its fractional contribution to the overall flux decreasing to low energy only as @xmath105 .",
    "the detection of uhecrs above @xmath1 imply that the brightest sources must lie at distances smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "uhecrs with @xmath107 from such bright sources will suffer energy loss only by pair production , because at @xmath108 ev the mean - free - path for pion production interaction ( in which the fractional energy loss is @xmath109 ) is larger than @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , the energy loss due to pair production over @xmath2 propagation is only @xmath102 .    in the case where the typical displacement of the uhecrs due to deflections by inter - galactic magnetic fields is much smaller than the correlation length , @xmath111 , all the uhecrs that arrive at the observer",
    "are essentially deflected by the same magnetic field structures , and the absence of random energy loss during propagation implies that all rays with a fixed observed energy would reach the observer with exactly the same direction and time delay . at a fixed time , therefore , the source would appear mono - energetic and point - like . in reality ,",
    "energy loss due to pair production results in a finite but small spectral and angular width , @xmath112 @xcite .    in the case where the typical displacement of the uhecrs is much larger than the correlation length , @xmath113 ,",

    "uhecrs are deflected by independent magnetic field structures .",

    "if the uhecr sources are indeed extra - galactic , and if they are correlated with luminous matter , then the inhomogeneity of the large scale galaxy distribution on scales @xmath128 should be imprinted on the uhecr arrival directions .",
    "the expected anisotropy signature and its dependence on the relative bias between the uhecr sources and the galaxy distribution and on the ( unknown ) intrinsic uhecr source density have been examined in @xcite .",

    ", it was found that the exposure required for a northern hemisphere detector to discriminate between isotropic uhecr source distribution and an unbiased distribution that traces the lss is approximately @xmath150 times the current fly s eye exposure ( @xmath151 the expected auger exposure ) .",
    "if the uhecr source distribution is strongly biased , in a way similar to that of radio galaxies , the required exposure is @xmath152 times smaller .",
    "furthermore , with @xmath150 times the current fly s eye exposure , it would be possible to discriminate between biased and non - biased source distribution .",
    "the anisotropy signal is not sensitive to the currently unknown number density of sources .",
    "stanev _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have recently reported that the arrival directions of @xmath153 uhecr events detected by the haverah park experiment show a concentration in the direction of the super - galactic plane . in agreement with stanev _",
    ", it is found in @xcite that the probability to obtain the haverah park results assuming an isotropic source distribution is very low .",
    "however , the results of @xcite show that this probability is not significantly higher for models where the source distribution traces the lss ; thus , the concentration of the haverah park events towards the super - galactic plane can not be explained by the known lss .",
    "it is important to note that for the biased model the probability to obtain the haverah park results is smaller than for the unbiased one .",
    "this reflects the fact that the super - clusters , while concentrated towards the super - galactic plane , have offsets above and below the super - galactic plane which cause the inferred uhecr distribution to be less flattened than seen in the haverah park data .",
    "the grb model for uhecr production has several predictions , which would allow it to be tested with future experiments . in this model , the average number of sources contributing to the flux decreases with energy much more rapidly than in the case where the uhecr sources are steady @xcite .",
    "a critical energy exists , @xmath154 , above which a few sources produce most of the flux , and the observed spectra of these sources is narrow , @xmath117 : the bright sources at high energy should be absent in uhecrs of much lower energy , since particles take longer to arrive the lower their energy .",
    "in contrast , a model of steady sources predicts that the brightest sources at high energies should also be the brightest ones at low energies .    at the highest energies , where most of the cosmic rays should come only from a few sources ,",
    "bursting sources should be identified from only a small number of events from their coincident directions .",
    "many more cosmic rays need to be detected at lower energies , where many sources contribute to the flux , in order to identify sources .",
    "recently , the agasa experiment reported the presence of 3 pairs of uhecrs with angular separations ( within each pair ) @xmath155 , roughly consistent with the measurement error , among a total of 36 uhecrs with @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "the two highest energy agasa events were in these pairs . given the total solid angle observed by the experiment , @xmath157 , the probability to have found 3 pairs by chance is @xmath158 ; and , given that three pairs were found , the probability that the two highest energy events are among the three pairs by chance is 2.4% .",
    "therefore , this observation favors the bursting source model , although more data are needed to confirm it .    above @xmath90",
    ", there is a significant probability to observe one source with a flux considerably higher than average .",
    "if such a source is present , its narrow spectrum may produce a `` gap '' in the overall spectrum , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fignc ] .",
    "it had recently been argued @xcite that the observation of such an energy gap would imply that the sources of @xmath68 uhecrs are different from the sources at lower energy , hinting that these are produced by the decay of a new type of massive particle .",
    "we see here that this is not the case when bursting sources are allowed , owing to the time variability .",
    "if such an energy gap is present , our model predicts that most of the uhecrs above the gap should normally come from one source .",
    "if our model is correct , then the fly s eye event above @xmath42 suggests that we live at one of the times when a bright source is present at high energies .",

    "[ figbl ] ) . with energy resolution of @xmath109 , the auger detectors would easily allow to determine the spectral width of the sources , and therefore to put interesting constraints on the unknown structure of the magnetic field .",
    "if the distribution of uhecr sources traces the large scale structure ( lss ) of luminous matter , large exposure detectors should clearly reveal anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of uhecrs above @xmath166 .",
    "with @xmath150 times the current fly s eye exposure ( @xmath151 the expected auger exposure ) , it would be possible to determine whether the sources are distributed isotropically , or correlate with known lss .",
    "furthermore , it would be possible to determine whether or not the source distribution is highly biased compared to _ iras _ galaxies ( as radio galaxies are ) .",
    "thus , the anisotropy signal would provide constraints on the source population .",
    "finally , we would like to note another possible signature of the grb model , which was not discussed above . the energy lost by the uhecrs as they propagate and interact with the microwave background is transformed by cascading into secondary gev - tev photons .",
    "a significant fraction of these photons can arrive with delays much smaller than the uhecr delay if much of inter - galactic space is occupied by large - scale magnetic `` voids '' , regions of size @xmath167 and field weaker than @xmath168 .",

    "the value required to account for observed galactic fields if the field were frozen in the protogalactic plasma , the delay of protons produced by a burst at a distance of @xmath2 is @xmath170 , and the fluence of secondary photons above @xmath171 on hour  day time scales is @xmath172 @xcite .",
