    "the dynamical triangulation approach to quantum gravity has proven to be a very powerful method @xcite . in two - dimensions",
    "it yields the same results for critical exponents as the liouville theory @xcite .",
    "contrary to the latter , this approach can be straightforwardly generalized to higher dimensional case which is frequently referred to as simplicial gravity @xcite . results from numerical studies of pure gravity without matter fields in four dimensions showed that the continuum limit of this model does not exist @xcite . in order to obtain more realistic models ,",
    "one has tried to include matter fields and to couple them to gravity @xcite .",
    "this program has so far succeeded only for bosonic matter .",
    "putting fermions on random simplicial manifold is a more difficult task . in general",
    "it requires introducing an additional field of local frames in order to define a spin structure @xcite . in the case of a compact manifold",
    "this is a topological problem .",
    "although many ingredients of the construction are known and can be generalized to any number of dimensions , the topological part of the problem has been solved so far only in two dimensions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will study properties of the dirac - wilson operator on two - dimensional dynamical triangulation with spherical topology .",
    "the analysis of the spectrum in the critical region allows us to calculate critical indices as for example the hausdorff dimension .",
    "we cross - check properties of the spectrum using the fact that the partition function of the fermionic model can be mapped into the partition function of ising model on dynamical triangulation , which is analytically solvable @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the majorana - dirac - wilson operator @xmath1 becomes discrete when the hopping parameter admits the value @xmath2 corresponding to the value @xmath8 of the coupling in the ising model . we show that this behaviour can be explained by the presence of a set of points in antiferromagnetic phase ( @xmath9 ) , for which some eigenvalues of the operator are determined by local properties of the triangulation and not by its random character .    the paper is organized as follows  : first we define the model , then we recall some facts about its relation to the ising model @xcite , we present results of numerical studies and shortly conclude at the end by summarizing and listing open questions . in the appendix , for comparison , we calculate the spectrum of the dirac - wilson operator on a regular triangulation .",
    "the model of fermions minimally coupled to euclidean gravity is given by the partition function @xmath10 where the sum goes over @xmath11-dimensional simplicial manifolds from a class @xmath12 , say , for instance , with spherical topology .",
    "each triangulation is dressed with the fermion field located in the centers of @xmath11-simplices .",
    "the integral over field on a given triangulation @xmath13 defines the partition function @xmath14 , which at the same time provides a weight of this triangulation in the ensemble .",
    "the action reads @xmath15 where the fermionic fields @xmath16 are located in the centers of triangles .",
    "the sum over @xmath17 runs over oriented pairs of neighboring triangles , or equivalently , over oriented dual links .",
    "the hopping operator is @xmath18 the dirac - wilson operator is denoted by @xmath19 and the spin connection by @xmath20 . in order to be able to calculate spinor and vector components",
    ", we endow each @xmath11-simplex with an orthonormal local frame .",
    "a frame is a set of orthonormal oriented vectors @xmath21 , @xmath22 . to each vector @xmath21",
    "we ascribe a dirac gamma matrix @xmath23 , in such a way that its numerical value is identical in each frame .",
    "the local vector @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) is a unit vector which points from the center of the simplex @xmath25 to the center of one of its neighbors @xmath26 .",
    "it just tells us the direction of the local derivative .",
    "the inner product of this vector and of gamma matrices , which is denoted by dot in ( [ h ] ) , has to be understood as a sum of gamma matrices @xmath23 multiplied by the components of @xmath27_a$ ] in the given frame at @xmath26 , denoted by the upper index .",
    "thus , the product of the same vector @xmath24 expressed in another frame yields a different matrix  : @xmath28_a \\gamma^a$ ] .",
    "as mentioned the matrix @xmath20 plays the role of spin connection .",
    "it allows us to parallel transport a spinor from the simplex @xmath25 to the simplex @xmath26 , or in other words , to recalculate spinor components between two neighboring frames @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",
    "the matrix @xmath20 is an image in the spinorial representation of the rotation matrix @xmath29 which parallel transports vectors .",
    "the map @xmath30 is not unique , namely it is defined up to sign .",
    "as we will see below , the signs of @xmath31 must be adjusted to fulfill a consistency condition ( [ sp ] ) for all elementary plaquettes of the simplicial manifold .",
    "this is a topological problem .",
    "this problem has been solved in two - dimensions where an explicit construction of the signs of the spin connection matrices @xmath20 has been given @xcite .",
    "let us shortly recall the main steps of the construction .    in two dimensions each orthonormal frame consists of two vectors @xmath32 where @xmath33 is @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "the first index of @xmath32 refers to the triangle in which the frame is located . for any pair of neighboring triangles @xmath26 , @xmath25 we can define a spin connection as a two by two rotation matrix @xmath36^a_b$ ] , such that @xmath37_a^b e_{jb}$ ] . using matrix notation this relation",
    "can be written as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the relative angle between the two neighboring frames .",
    "@xmath41 is the standard antisymmetric tensor .",
    "the trace of an elementary loop around a dual plaquette is a geometrical invariant directly related to the curvature ( deficit angle ) of the vertex in the center of the plaquette .",
    "one can check that @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the deficit angle of the vertex in middle of the plaquette .",
    "the product @xmath44 of connections on all links on the plaquette perimeter @xmath45 is a rotation matrix which gives the integrated rotation of a tangent vector parallel transported around this loop .",
    "the equation ( [ uuu ] ) is a sort of wilson discretization @xcite of curvature calculated from the cartan structure equations @xcite .",
    "now the idea is to write down an analogous equation as ( [ uuu ] ) in the spinorial representation .",
    "first we have to introduce a parallel transporter @xmath20 for spinors for each pair of neighboring vertices .",
    "this is exactly the object which we need in ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the connection @xmath20 is an spinorial image of @xmath29 .",
    "one can choose a representation of gamma matrices such that @xmath46 .",
    "one immediately sees that indeed @xmath20 can be calculated for a given @xmath29 up to sign .",
    "when defining the dirac - wilson operator ( [ h ] ) we can not allow for ambiguities , so we have to give a unique prescription how to calculate @xmath20 .",
    "we do this by choosing @xmath47 and specifying the angles @xmath40 uniquely .",
    "more precisely we define @xmath48 where the angle @xmath49 at triangle @xmath25 is the angle between the vector @xmath50 of the frame at @xmath25 and the vector @xmath24 ( pointing from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ) , and likewise @xmath51 at triangle @xmath26 is the angle between the vector @xmath52 and the vector @xmath53 ( pointing from @xmath26 to @xmath25 ) ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "both the angles are restricted to the range @xmath54 and both are measured in the same direction , say clockwise .",
    "thus the angle @xmath40 is defined without the @xmath55 ambiguity and hence the rotation matrix @xmath20 is also uniquely determined including the total sign .",
    "local geometry of two neighboring triangles is shown .",
    "the position of the first frame vector @xmath56 for a given triangle is marked by a line emerging from the triangle center .",
    "the position of the second frame vector @xmath57 is implicitly given by the fact that the angle between @xmath58 and @xmath59 counted clockwise is @xmath60 .",
    "the vector @xmath53 points from the center of the triangle @xmath26 to @xmath25 .",
    "the arch in the triangle @xmath26 represents the angle @xmath51 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the arch in the triangle @xmath25 corresponds to the angle @xmath49 between @xmath50 and @xmath24 . in the example shown in figure @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and for other two neighbors of @xmath25  : @xmath63 , @xmath64.,width=302 ]    one can easily check that , for the definition ( [ u1 ] ) of @xmath20 s , the parallel transporter around an elementary loop gives @xmath65 the argument of cosine got halved @xmath66 in comparison with ( [ uuu ] ) because for each link on @xmath45 we have @xmath67 .",
    "the total sign @xmath68 of the product @xmath69 has to be calculated .",
    "it turns out to depend on all angles @xmath40 on the loop and it may admit either value @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the presence of elementary plaquettes which would have negative sign is an unwanted effect .",
    "for example , a spinor transported around a flat plaquette with @xmath71 would change the sign @xmath72 .",
    "we require that the parallel transport around a close loop in a flat patch not change a spinor .",
    "furthermore , we require the signs @xmath68 to be positive for all elementary plaquettes @xmath73 one can give the following argument in favor of the naturalness of this requirement .",
    "an elementary loop goes through triangles sharing a vertex .",
    "the geometry of a patch consisting of those triangles corresponds to the geometry of a cone .",
    "it is everywhere flat except at the vertex where it is singular .",
    "one can regularize such geometry by smoothing the peak of the cone ( making it differentiable ) in a very small region with radius @xmath74 .",
    "such a regularization does not affect the loop which lies in a distance @xmath75 from the vertex . continuously shrinking the loop in such a regularized geometry",
    ", one can continuously change the angle of the loop rotation matrix without changing the sign .",
    "a completely shrunken loop must have positive sign since it lies in a flat patch .",
    "this implies @xmath76 .",
    "one can also check that the consistency condition ( [ sp ] ) plays an essential role in the topological considerations or in deriving the equivalence with the ising model .",
    "the construction of the connections given in ( [ u1 ] ) does not fulfill the consistency condition ( [ sp ] ) .",
    "we will therefore modify the construction of @xmath31 s by introducing for each link an additional sign degree of freedom @xmath77 @xmath78 one can show that this freedom is sufficient to globally , for each elementary loop , fulfill the consistency condition ( [ sp ] ) , on a triangulation of an orientable manifold .",
    "thus , technically , to define the dirac - wilson operator on a triangulation , we have to first assign an orthonormal frame to each triangle , and then for the frame assignment , to find link signs @xmath77 meeting the consistency condition @xmath79 for each plaquette .",
    "the remaining part is straightforward .",
    "namely , we express the operator @xmath20 in terms of the angles @xmath49 and @xmath51 and likewise , the product @xmath80 in terms of @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we parameterize the hopping operator @xmath81 entirely by @xmath49 and @xmath51 and @xmath77 . for each pair of neighboring triangles",
    "the angles can be read off from the given frame assignment ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "choosing the following representation of gamma matrices  : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , where the @xmath84 are pauli matrices , we eventually arrive at @xmath85 we see that in two dimensions the dirac - wilson operator on a triangulation @xmath13 is given by a matrix consisting of two - by - two blocks @xmath86_{\\alpha}^{\\beta } =   \\frac{1}{2 } \\delta_{ij } \\delta_{\\alpha}^{\\beta } - k p_{ij } \\left[{\\cal h}_{ij}\\right]_\\alpha^\\beta   \\label{dwo}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is an adjacency matrix  : @xmath88 there is no summation over @xmath89 in the equation ( [ dwo ] ) .",
    "the blocks @xmath81 have a very simple structure .",
    "in fact , we can simplify it further by restricting the set of values of the angles in ( [ hm ] ) from the whole interval @xmath54 to a discrete set of three values separated by @xmath90 , for instance , @xmath91 . for this choice , the first vector @xmath56 of a frame at a triangle points from the center of the triangle to one of its vertices . in a sense , this set of three frame positions is a minimal set reflecting the symmetry of equilateral triangle .    since physical quantities",
    "do not depend on the choice of frames , this restriction is a sort of gauge condition . with this choice , the blocks ( [ hm ] ) may admit only nine different forms depending on the nine different choices of the angles @xmath92 , @xmath93 in ( [ hm ] ) .",
    "they can be precomputed .",
    "for example , for the frame assignment in fig.[fig1 ] @xmath94 , @xmath95 and for @xmath96 we have @xmath97",
    "the idea is now to calculate spectra of the dirac - wilson operator for different triangulations from the ensemble ( [ z ] ) . summing up ( averaging ) all the spectra we obtain the spectrum of the dirac - wilson operator for fermions interacting with 2d gravity .",
    "more precisely , we will consider a field of majorana - fermions coupled to gravity . at the critical point it corresponds to the conformal field with the central charge @xmath98 .",
    "denote the components of the spinor @xmath99 by @xmath100 , and of @xmath101 by @xmath102 .",
    "the majorana condition reads  : @xmath103 or @xmath104 , where @xmath41 is the standard antisymmetric tensor , in this notation , the action for majorana fermions can be written as @xmath105_\\alpha^\\beta \\psi_{i\\beta } = \\sum_{ij } \\psi_{i\\alpha } \\widehat{\\cal d}_{ij}^{\\alpha\\beta } \\psi_{j\\beta } \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath106_\\gamma^\\beta \\ , = \\ , \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon^{\\alpha \\beta } \\delta_{ij } - k p_{ij } \\epsilon^{\\alpha \\gamma } [ { \\cal h}_{ij}]_\\gamma^\\beta \\ , , \\label{epsd}\\ ] ] or in short @xmath107  : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a deterministic part , and @xmath110 is a random part which consists of two - by - two matrices @xmath111 ( [ hm ] ) located at nonvanishing positions of the adjacency matrix @xmath87 which correspond to pairs of neighboring triangles .",
    "@xmath87 is an off - diagonal random matrix in the @xmath89 indices .",
    "one can show that @xmath112 is antisymmetric under the change of pairs of indices @xmath113 and hence @xmath114 . for each triangulation individually , the integral over fermions in ( [ z ] ) yields pfaffian of the matrix @xmath112 .",
    "thus for majorana fermions on a two - dimensional triangulation the partition function ( [ z ] ) is a sum of pfaffians of the dirac - wilson operator @xmath115 in the last step we have used the inequality @xmath116 , which can be proven by the hopping parameter expansion .",
    "the consistency condition ( [ sp ] ) turns out to be essential in the proof .",
    "namely , one shows that the pffafian is represented as a sum over loop configurations each of which contributes a positive factor if the condition ( [ sp ] ) is met @xcite .    using this expansion one",
    "can also establish the equivalence between the partition function @xmath14 and the partition function of the nearest neighbor ising model with spins @xmath117 located at the vertices @xmath118 of @xmath13 @xmath119 where @xmath120 the partition functions @xmath121 ( [ iz ] ) and @xmath14 ( [ z ] ) are equal for @xmath122 in the derivation of this equivalence one identifies loop configurations , arising in the hopping expansion of @xmath14 with domain walls of the ising model .",
    "again , the consistency condition ( [ sp ] ) plays the crucial role here . for a non - spherical triangulation one has to carefully treat topological effects related to the existence of non - contractable loops which may give a negative contribution for antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "one can get rid of all negative contributions performing the gso projection that is summing over all spin structures of the manifold @xcite .",
    "this and another topological issues are discussed elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we will restrict ourselves to spherical triangulations for which we automatically have @xmath123 for each triangulation @xmath124 and hence also for the sum over all triangulations in @xmath12 @xmath125 the critical temperature of the ising model for the partition function @xmath126 is known analytically to be @xmath127 @xcite . translating the critical temperature to the hopping parameter ( [ kb ] ) we obtain the following critical value @xmath128 for which fermions become massless .",
    "another interesting point which can be deduced from the equation ( [ kb ] ) is that the value of the hopping parameter",
    "@xmath129 corresponds to @xmath8 which is the border between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes . for @xmath9",
    "one expects frustration in the ising model on a triangulation and hence that the lowest energy state is highly degenerated . as we will see below , the behavior of the spectrum of the dirac - wilson is also sensitive to passing over this border .",
    "first , we will however restrict @xmath130 to the ferromagnetic range @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "the equivalence of the partition functions @xmath121 and @xmath14 may be used to relate the average energy @xmath132 of the ising model on a triangulation @xmath13 to eigenvalues of the dirac - wilson operator . differentiating both sides of ( [ d ] ) with respect to @xmath133 we obtain @xmath134 where @xmath135 are eigenvalues of the dirac - wilson operator @xmath136 . for our choice of the representation of gamma matrices , @xmath136 is a real matrix .",
    "its spectrum consists of either real eigenvalues or of pairs of complex conjugates .",
    "thus the sum on the right hand side of ( [ el ] ) is a real number .",
    "similarly , the fluctuations of the ising energy on the triangulation @xmath13 are given by @xmath137 averaging over triangulations we obtain the energy density and heat - capacity of the ising model coupled to gravity calculated in terms of the eigenvalues of the dirac - wilson operator @xmath138 @xmath139 the equivalence of the models can also be very useful in mc simulations of the model . to show this ,",
    "let us compare three numerical experiments in which ( a ) the ising model is used to generate triangulations and to measure the ising energy and heat capacity ; ( b ) the ising model is used as a generator of triangulations but measurements are carried out using the fermion field ; ( c ) the fermionic model is used both to generate triangulations and to perform measurements .",
    "heat capacity @xmath140 for the system with @xmath141 triangles for the three cases discussed in the text  : ( a ) ising - ising ( line ) ; ( b ) ising - fermion ( filled symbols ) ; ( c ) fermion - fermion ( empty symbols ) .",
    "the three methods give the same results within the error bars , which are here of order of the size of the symbols used.,width=302 ]    as shown in fig.[fabc ] the three methods yield exactly the same results .",
    "the methods differ , however , significantly in the cpu time needed to generate results of the same quality .",
    "the first difference comes from the configuration generator which is much faster for the ising model than for the fermionic determinant . in the latter case , to calculate a metropolis weight for a single local change of triangulation , _",
    "i.e. _ a flip of one link on the triangulation , requires the recomputation of the determinant of the dirac - wilson operator on the modified lattice .",
    "this is a tedious task for which the number of operations grows with the third power of the system size @xmath142 .",
    "thus one expects that the time of a sweep through the lattice grows as @xmath143 for the fermionic configurations generator .",
    "one sweep for the ising model , which consists of a sweep of local updates of ising spins , a fixed number of wolff cluster updates , and a sweep of local changes of triangulation , lasts in cpu units roughly proportionally to the system size @xmath142 .",
    "thus , the fermionic algorithm is competitive with the ising generator only for very small lattices .",
    "as far as measurements are concerned the situation is more complex .",
    "for example , one can not determine the spectrum of the dirac - wilson operator using only the ising spins .",
    "one can , however , do the opposite . for a given lattice ,",
    "the time of calculating all eigenvalues of the dirac - wilson operator is proportional to @xmath144 .",
    "having done this , one is able for this triangulation to exactly calculate the ising energy ( [ el ] ) and it higher moments ( [ sl ] ) without statistical fluctuations .",
    "if one instead used the ising model , one has to sample ising configuration many times to reduce the error . in general , the cost of a single measurement of the energy is proportional to @xmath142 .",
    "the error of the single measurement of the energy density decreases like @xmath145 . summarizing",
    ", we expect the cpu time to measure energy with a given precision to grow as @xmath146 .",
    "the cpu time grows rapidly with the order for measurements of higher moments of energy .    in order to obtain the data the quality presented in fig .",
    "[ fabc ] for @xmath141 , the methods discussed above required ( a ) 1000 cpu min .",
    "( b ) 6 cpu min . and ( c ) 100 min . on the computer alpha xp1000/ev6/500 mhz",
    "the distribution of eigenvalues @xmath147 of the dirac - wilson operator for @xmath148 and @xmath149 on random lattice.,width=302 ]    in the production runs we use the method ( b ) , which relies on generating triangulations from the partition function of the ising model . at each measurement",
    "we ignore the values of the ising spins and we assign frames @xmath150 and @xmath77-signs to the triangulation to reconstruct the dirac - wilson operator ( [ hm],[dwo ] ) .    a typical spectrum of the dirac - wilson operator on random triangulation is shown in fig.[eig ] . the main effect on the spectrum of changing the hopping parameter",
    "@xmath130 is to rescale it around the point @xmath151 .",
    "the positions of the two claw - shaped ends of the spectrum move with @xmath130 .",
    "one can find a value of @xmath130 for which the ends lie closest the origin @xmath152 .",
    "this value can be treated as a pseudo - critical value @xmath153 for which the mass of the fermion excitation is minimal .",
    "for @xmath154 the origin @xmath152 lies outside the claws , while for @xmath155 inside .",
    "in fact , this is the main difference between the two regimes , since beside the scaling factor the shape of the spectrum is almost constant .",
    "the claw - shaped ends of the pseudo - critical spectra successively approach each other when the system size @xmath142 is increased .",
    "they eventually close entirely at the origin @xmath152 for infinite @xmath142 , signaling the occurrence of massless excitations .",
    "one can alternatively study the spectrum of the operator @xmath156 .",
    "in fact , this operator is closer related , in spirit , to majorana fermions ( [ epsd ] ) due to the presence of the charge conjugation matrix @xmath41 . since the matrix @xmath112 is antisymmetric , and it is real in our representation , its spectrum is purely imaginary .",
    "thus , the eigenvalue density of this operator is one dimensional  : @xmath157 the spectrum is symmetric @xmath158 .",
    "we will constrain ourselves to the positive branch . for each triangulation eigenvalues of the positive part of the spectrum",
