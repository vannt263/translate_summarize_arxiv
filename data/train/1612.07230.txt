    "a central notion of physics is the rate of change .",

    "modern calculus is not limited only to to using only ordinary derivatives and linear growth .",
    "for example , _ fractional calculus _",
    "is used to model strongly non - linear phenomena , such as the those governed by power laws , or phenomena resulting in features at all scales  i.e. fractals .",
    "many types of anomalous transport phenomena in physics are modeled using fractional diffusion - like equations @xcite .",
    "the spatial complexity of a medium can impose geometrical constraints on transport processes on all length scales that can fundamentally alter the laws of standard diffusion @xcite .",
    "interesting links between fractional calculus and fractal random walks and statistical physics has been studied by @xcite .",
    "for example , continuous - time - random - walks models are used to model anomalous diffusion phenomena @xcite . these models in limit yield fractional fokker - planck equations in terms of caputo fractional derivatives @xcite .",
    "fractional diffusion models have been employed , for example , in hydrology @xcite ; heat conduction @xcite ; and anomalous drug absorption and disposition processes @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in the general case fractional differential equations are difficult to solve exactly even with special functions .",
    "a fractional embedding of an ordinary differential equation is not unique and different embeddings correspond to different microscopic physical models @xcite .",
    "it also introduces sensitivity of the boundary conditions , which requires regularization procedures leading to caputo - type of derivatives .",
    "another disadvantage of the fractional calculus is the difficulty to interpret the fractional derivative or integral because of their _ non - local character_. all this led to development of some alternatives of fractional calculus , retaining of the locality of the description @xcite .",
    "for example , such are the calculus on time - scales and local fractional calculus @xcite .",
    "classically , physical variables , such as velocity or acceleration , are considered to be differentiable functions of position . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum mechanical paths were found to be non - differentiable and stochastic in simulations @xcite .",
    "the relaxation of the differentiability assumption could open new avenues in describing physical phenomena , for example , using the _ scale relativity theory _ developed by nottale @xcite , which assumes fractality of geodesics and quantum - mechanical paths .",
    "the main tenet of the scale relativity theory promotes the scale ( temporal and/or spatial ) of observation as an independent physical variable .",
    "this scale is considered to be irreducible in the sense that it can not be removed from the equations of dynamics by means of a mathematical limiting process . moreover , by endowing it with the status of an independent variable the theory admits a continuum representation of the scale as a quantity .    in the present paper",
    "i follow this direction of investigation and give a more precise meaning to the physical intuition offered by scale relativity by introducing the formal concept of a _ scale space _ and defining mappings between derivatives in `` physical '' space and certain functions in this abstract scale space .",

    "since for a singular signal the derivative either vanishes or it diverges then the rate of change for such signals can not be characterized in terms of derivatives .",
    "one could apply to such signals either the _ fractal variation operators _ of certain order or the difference quotients as nottale does and avoid taking the limit .",
