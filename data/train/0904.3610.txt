    "the presence of low - frequency , long - wavelength fluctuations in hot magnetized plasmas is often found to alter the plasma confinement properties leading to an anomalously high heat and energy transfer across magnetic field lines as compared to purely collisional values , a phenomenon known as anomalous or turbulent transport . while the basic deteriorating effect of the fluctuations on the plasma confinement is relatively well understood",
    ", a detailed , microscopic picture of anomalous transport turns out to be far than simple .",
    "situations exist in which collisional and fluctuation induced properties operate essentially on the same footing , as for instance some regimes of electron outward fluxes in solar coronal loops as discussed by galloway _ et al . _ @xcite . well before that , in the fusion field , essentially the same mechanism has been proposed for electron heat transport due to parallel thermal conductivity in a tokamak with destroyed magnetic surfaces @xcite .",
    "early investigations of this problem are due to the pioneering work of rosenbluth _ et al . _ @xcite . in all these models the fluctuations are such as to introduce some form of braiding of magnetic field lines @xcite , with  time \" associated with the axial ( toroidal ) dependence . in the braided magnetic fields ,",
    "the collisional transverse diffusion is naturally enhanced as a consequence of the parallel motion providing a continuous mapping of the particle s perpendicular random walk . in realistic tokamaks , in view of the many different processes actually producing the transport ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , just to mention some ) , effects caused by magnetic braiding can , however , represent only a fraction of the overall transport of energy and heat and be significant within only a limited range of parameters .",
    "nevertheless , addressing the magnetic braiding phenomenon in the appropriate setting @xcite defines a problem of fundamental and practical importance .",
    "not only does it relate to a fascinating set of nonlinear dynamics issues @xcite , but also a reliable extrapolation of braiding induced transport losses to reactor - relevant plasmas is not at hand .    in order to accurately assess the collisional transport in the braided magnetic field ,",
    "a few parameters are needed .",
    "these parameters are : ( i ) parallel ( @xmath4 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath3 ) fluctuation correlation lengths ; ( ii ) collisional parallel and perpendicular particle diffusivities : these quantities are actually known as functions of plasma density and temperature in both axial and toroidal geometries @xcite ; ( iii ) fluctuation induced magnetic field line diffusion coefficient ( @xmath6 ) ; and ( iv ) the rate of exponential separation of initially close magnetic field lines , @xmath7 , a parameter often referred to as the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy @xcite .",
    "most previous theoretical and numerical studies have focused on addressing the scaling laws for the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 as a function of the fluctuation strength or , more conveniently , the kubo number @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ratio of the rms magnetic fluctuation field to the background magnetic field . in general , the results of those investigations can be summarized by a power law dependence @xmath8 ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where the scaling is quasilinear - like ( @xmath9 ) for @xmath10 and percolation - like ( @xmath11 ) for @xmath0 ( as distinct from traditionally believed , bohm - like scaling with @xmath12 @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the percolation scaling with @xmath11 was questioned by milovanov @xcite , who argued that @xmath13 instead .",
    "support to this value can be found in the numerical simulation results of ref .",
    "milovanov has also addressed @xcite the theoretical foundations of the percolation scaling by relating it to a description in terms of fractional derivative equations and hamiltonian _ pseudochaos _ ( random non - chaotic dynamics with zero lyapunov exponents ) @xcite .",
    "this connection to pseudochaotic properties of percolation will play a central role in the theoretical investigations below .",
    "actually less progress has been made with respect to addressing the @xmath7 value . here , too , scaling relations have been proposed @xcite : @xmath14 for @xmath10 and @xmath15 for @xmath0 .",
    "even so , their direct numerical investigation has been performed only recently @xcite .",
    "a net result of this investigation follows : while the quadratic behavior of @xmath7 in the parameter range of small kubo numbers @xmath10 could readily be reproduced , a strong deviation from the predicted square root - like scaling @xmath15 was found for @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , the observed behavior was markedly slower ( fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , possibly slower than a power law , with a tendency to saturation for the largest achievable @xmath16 ( of order 10@xmath17 ) .",
    "this study is aimed to elaborate those investigations and to comprehend the observed discrepancies .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a numerical study of the problem is presented in sec .",
    "2 , where we detail the numerical techniques and also demonstrate the phenomenon of saturation of the ks entropy for the largest achievable @xmath16 .",
    "these results are theoretically analyzed in sec .",
    "3 on the basis of a hamiltonian approach .",
    "in particular we discuss the implication of fractal geometric properties in the entropy growth slowing down .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "we begin with the standard equations for magnetic field lines , with @xmath18 a three - dimensional ( 3d ) position vector , written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the natural parameter , such that @xmath21 is the length along a field line , and @xmath22 is the magnetic field .",
    "the latter is set as a sum of a constant homogeneous background field @xmath23 in a straight - cylinder geometry ( here @xmath24 is a unit vector in the axial direction ) and a static magnetic perturbation , defined by its fourier series expansion as @xmath25 , \\label{2 } % eq.~(\\ref{2})\\ ] ] where @xmath26 are two polarization unit vectors ( these corresponding to the shear alfvn and compressional alfvn waves ) , @xmath27 are randomly chosen phases , and @xmath28 are the spectral amplitudes . basically , this is the same realization of magnetic fluctuations as in refs .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath29 and @xmath30 , so that the field @xmath31 be real .",
    "finally , the fluctuation spectrum is taken in the power law form to be , with @xmath32 a normalization constant , @xmath33 such power law spectra of varying anisotropy have been found in many plasmas , both in space and in the laboratory @xcite . in the simulation @xmath34",
    "reminding of the kolmogorov spectrum of fully developed turbulence .",
    "it is worth to remark that , while the exact entropy value in the simulation may be somewhat dependent on @xmath35 , we expect that the basic physics conclusions regarding the functional behavior of @xmath7 will remain essentially the same .",
    "this expectation relies on the results of theoretical analysis below , which will lead to ( i ) generic functional form for the entropy in hamiltonian dynamics , and ( ii ) comprehension of the features of nonlinear saturation of the @xmath7 function in association with the natural dependency of resonant and percolation properties on the kubo number .",
    "note that the numerical model setup in eqs .",
    "( [ 1])@xmath36([3 ] ) is essentially 3d .",
    "the values of the correlation lengths @xmath37 determine the shape of the constant intensity ellipsoids in @xmath38-space .",
    "special cases of this correspond to an isotropic turbulence ( @xmath39 ) ; a quasi-2d turbulence ( @xmath40 ) ; and the slab turbulence ( @xmath41 ) . for the present analysis , @xmath42 , but",
    "other cases have been considered in refs .",
    "the wave numbers are taken from @xmath43 , with the wave vectors defined as @xmath44 . to match with the natural physics and computer limitations , the power law dependence in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) is truncated on both sides implying finite cutoffs at @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the perpendicular plane , and at @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the axial direction .",
    "it is convenient to use @xmath49 as the unit length in the perpendicular plane .",
    "hence the perpendicular correlation length can be expressed as @xmath50 . to match with the expected properties of heat transport in coronal loops and pertinent model parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , here we set @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which generates some 8200 independent wave modes in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "we take notice of the fact that the ks entropy may depend on the spectral extension in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) since smaller wavelengths favour faster separation of the field lines @xcite ; however , for the runs presented here , we keep the spectral extension fixed ( i.e. , @xmath53 is not varied ) . the sizes ( in respective directions ) of the simulation box are set to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , so that at least two correlation lengths have to be traveled before the same magnetic configuration is reproduced .",
    "this effectively eliminates the periodicity effects @xcite .    .",
    "after an initial transient , the exponents settle to the asymptotic values.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in the basic theory @xcite , the ks entropy is obtained as the sum of the positive lyapunov exponents for the unstable motions .",
    "the lyapunov exponents , in their turn , can be calculated numerically by implementing the algorithm of wolf _",
    "et al _ @xcite , in which they are obtained from the gram - schmidt orthonormalization . in the numerical model , @xmath2 is varied from 0.01 to 1 , and @xmath56 from 1 to 100 ; this choice of parameters has earlier been discussed for astrophysical applications in refs .",
    "@xcite . with these settings ,",
    "the kubo number @xmath16 can be varied from 0.01 to 100 .",
    "these values extrapolate from the quasilinear to the percolation regime as discussed in refs . @xcite . also , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the value of @xmath7 depends only on @xmath16 , and not separately on @xmath57 or @xmath58 . in this work ,",
    "focusing mainly on the percolation regime , we have restricted our investigations to the parameter range @xmath59 .",
    "overall , from 40 to 100 different initial conditions for the field line eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) have been used to compute the lyapunov exponents numerically .",
    "the numerical accuracy has been checked by asking that the sum of the three lyapunov exponents be zero , as implied by @xmath60 .",
    "after an initial transient , this was soon achieved with an accuracy of the order of @xmath61 .",
    "we also checked that the numerical algorithm has actually reached the asymptotic regime : figure 1 shows the three lyapunov exponents for @xmath62 as a function of the integration time .",
    "it can be seen that only one lyapunov exponent is substantially larger than zero , and that the sum of the three exponents equals zero .",
    "also , some small fluctuations are seen in the long time regime : this allows to estimate the statistical error of the kolmogorov entropy , which turns out to be less than 0.1 @xmath63 .",
    "the typical results of this investigation obtained for @xmath64 and @xmath65 are shown in figure 2 .",
    "there are two main conclusions to be drawn from the analysis .",
    "first , for not too large the @xmath16 values , @xmath66 , the @xmath7 function is well approximated by a logarithmic dependence @xmath67 , with @xmath68 and @xmath69 the numerical fitting parameters .",
    "this is shown in detail in the inset of figure 2 , where the fit is made only for the points up to @xmath62 .",
    "second , with the increasing @xmath16 the entropy logarithmic growth slows down showing signatures of saturation , consistently with our first results in ref .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure 2 , as fitting all the points with the logarithmic dependence shows a discrepancy which goes beyond the numerical error bars . when larger @xmath16 are achieved in the simulation ,",
    "the slowing down effect is more pronounced .",
    "these behaviors are in marked contrast with the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath15 for @xmath0 .",
    "in the parameter range of practical importance , the rms magnetic fluctuation is supposed not to exceed the background magnetic field @xmath70 . to simplify the analysis",

    "being somewhat restrictive , this condition , however , still retains the essential physics of the model . since we are interested in the regime when @xmath0 , we assume that @xmath72 with a large margin .",
    "thus , it is required that the turbulence be strongly anisotropic and its wave vector spectrum be actually squeezed to the perpendicular plane . with this gross yet relevant simplification",
    "we can cast the field - line eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) in the hamiltonian form @xmath73 by simplifying the magnetic field model to @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a static , transverse magnetic perturbation , @xmath76 is the axial component of the vector potential , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the position vector in the perpendicular plane .",

    "mathematically , this can be satisfied for fractal equipotential contours @xcite , characterized by diverging lengths due to the structure on many scales .    next , because of the sign symmetry of the fluctuation field in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , the zero - set @xmath93 contains a percolating equipotential line , which stretches the entire system @xcite .",
    "the percolating line is the channel through which the turbulent diffusion penetrates to the large scales .",

    "this fractal geometry is a generic property of fields with a broad power - law energy density distribution conventionally associated with",
    " turbulence \" @xcite .",
    "thus , when the fluctuations are very slow , we expect the resonance conditions to be naturally satisfied in vicinity of the percolating line , provided that the number of waves in eq .",

    "a net result from the above reasoning is that the resonance conditions in the limit of very low frequencies ( large kubo numbers ) are satisfied for fractal equipotential contours , which , as is already mentioned above , are found in close proximity to the percolating line .",
    "the resonance conditions alone do not , however , define the microscopic behaviors . to this end ,",
    "two important conditions need to be specified .",
    "one is the size of the nonlinearity parameter @xcite @xmath117 in order for phase space diffusion to actually occur , this parameter must be large , i.e. , @xmath118 . in this range , as was first observed by chirikov , the resonances will overlap @xcite and the dynamics can , after memory for the initial conditions has been lost , be described statistically in terms of a fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "topologically , the loss of memory is due to the mixing of trajectories in phase space .",
    "the mixing time is obtained from @xmath119 , while the number of overlapping resonances is ordered as @xmath120 .",
    "next the relationship between mixing and randomness must be addressed , which can be nontrivial in some cases .",
    "indeed , because of the many overlapping resonances , the dynamics will , in fact , be random after a certain transient time , which one would estimate as , say , two - three characteristic times it takes to pass from one resonance to the other . when the phase space accessible for random motions is",
    "wide enough ( ideally , comparable with the entire phase space of the system ) , then the transition to random dynamics occurs on time scales of the order of @xmath121 .",
    "this is a typical situation in chaotic dynamics .",
    "it should be understood , however , that this typical situation does not always take place .",
    "situations exist , in which the available phase space is just too narrow to permit good mixing properties .",
    "for instance , in low - frequency turbulence , random motions as dictated by pertinent resonance conditions can be squeezed to a subset of phase space with fractal geometry @xcite .",
    "it is this a situation that occurs in critical percolation @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the dynamics only partially acquire the chaotic property in that they show random behavior , while the mixing turns out to be very poor ( sub - exponential ) . this anomalously slow mixing may lead to  strange \" phenomena in phase space , for instance to stickiness of phase space trajectories @xcite , just to mention one .",
    "the implication is that the lyapunov exponents may vanish despite of the inherently random character of the motion .",

    "finds , then , that the transition to random dynamics occurs on time scales much shorter than @xmath121 .",
    "a simple model realization of this is found in random walks on percolation systems @xcite .",
    "anticipating our final conclusion below , here we mention that the observed properties of saturation of the ks entropy are explained in terms of the hamiltonian pseudochaos .      the other relevant condition that one needs to identify the microscopic pattern of behavior brings together the two building blocks of the model : fractality and randomness .",
    "focusing on the fractal properties we somehow expect the fractal range to be wide enough , ideally @xmath122 . on the other hand",
    ", the slowness of the fluctuations implies that @xmath123 for @xmath116 . for the purpose of formal orderings , because the two limiting procedures may not be commutative , we require @xmath124 diverge faster than @xmath5 . that is , given a finite fluctuation frequency , we set @xmath125 .",
    "the implication is that the fluctuations should not be too slow for the actual ( finite ) size of the system , otherwise the dynamics retain a deterministic character .",
    "equivalently , @xmath126 , showing that the diffusion time to the distance @xmath3 must be large compared to the period of the field . under these conditions , which are naturally satisfied for the small enough @xmath88 , the dynamics will be inherently random with @xmath118 even for very slow fluctuation frequencies .",
    "let us now rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) in a more insightful form .",

    "clearly , the entropy growth slowing down occurs as a consequence of fractality influencing the resonance conditions .",
    "furthermore , there is an upper bound on the entropy growth , and that is where the  saturation \" @xcite of the entropy comes into play .",

    "@xmath148 being close to zero implies that all the resonances have overlapped in a very narrow stochastic layer enveloping the separatrix .",
