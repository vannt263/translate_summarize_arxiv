    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most powerful explosions in the universe .",
    "prompt emission of grbs are mainly observed in the energy range of 10 kev - mev and show rapid time variability in their lightcurves .",
    "their spectra are often modeled by an empirical band function @xcite , which is a smoothly jointed broken power - law , whose physical origin is not yet identified .",
    "the typical low and high energy photon indices are distributed around @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , while the spectral peak ( break ) energy is distributed around @xmath4 a few @xmath5 .",
    "the most widely discussed model for the prompt emission mechanism is the internal shock model @xcite . in this model , it is assumed that relativistically moving shells emanate from the central engine with diverse velocities , and shocks form due to collisions of the shells .",
    "shocks are accompanied by particle acceleration , and eventually gamma - rays are produced by relativistic electrons via synchrotron radiation .",
    "the internal shock model can naturally explain the observed rapid time variability in the lightcurve and non - thermal nature of the spectra .",
    "however , it is known that the model suffers from poor radiation efficiency , since only the kinetic energy associated with the relative motion of shells can be released @xcite .",
    "this contradicts with observations which show high efficiencies of a few tens of percent @xcite .",
    "another difficulty is the low energy spectral index ( @xmath6 ) . a non - negligible fraction of observed grbs show hard spectra at low energies which can not be explained by synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "these well - known difficulties in the internal shock model have lead researchers to reconsider photospheric emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which is a natural consequence of the original fireball model @xcite",
    ". in this model , prompt gamma - rays are released at the photosphere when the fireball becomes optically thin .",
    "the peak energy of the spectra is determined by the temperature at the photosphere .",
    "this model has an advantage in that high emission efficiencies can be naturally achieved .",
    "strong observational support for this scenario has been provided by the recent detection of quasi - thermal emission by the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) , notably grb 090902b @xcite .    however , while there are many advantages , the photospheric emission model must overcome several difficulties .",
    "the major flaw is reproduction of the observed broad non - thermal spectra , since the photons that originate from regions of very high optical depths are inevitably thermalized .",
    "photospheric emission can , in principle , explain the hard low - energy spectra that can not be accounted for by synchrotron emission , by considering a superposition of emission components which have different temperatures ( multi - color blackbody ) .",
    "this is because the rayleigh - jeans part of the emission component has a much harder photon index ( @xmath7 ) than those inferred in all observed grbs .",
    "it is noted , however , that the existence of outflow models that can naturally account for the low energy spectra is still debated .",
    "recent theoretical studies which explore peak energies of photospheric emissions based on spherical ( one - dimensional ) outflow models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that it is difficult to regulate the temperature of the emissions to be well below the typical observed peak energies @xmath0 , particularly when dissipation is present ( but see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a mechanism that may overcome this difficulty ) .",
    "although dissipative processes are not considered , an outflow structure in two - dimensions suggested by @xcite may be a key ingredient to resolve this difficulty . based on hydrodynamical simulations of jet propagation @xcite ,",
    "@xcite modeled an outflow with a lorentz factor gradient in the lateral direction . by solving the transfer of photons within the jet",
    ", they indeed showed that the low energy spectra can be reproduced by the multi - color temperature effects due to the superposition of the photons released from different lateral positions that have various lorentz factors .    on the other hand ,",
    "the high energy part of the observed spectra is difficult to reproduce by the super - position of thermal emissions , since an unreasonably high temperature must be realized within the outflow . to overcome this difficulty , dissipative processes around the photosphere",
    "have been suggested in previous studies .",
    "various mechanisms such as shocks @xcite , magnetic reconnection @xcite and proton - neutron nuclear collisions @xcite have been proposed .",
    "all models are accompanied by the generation of relativistic electrons ( and positrons ) that upscatter the thermal photons to create the non - thermal spectra @xcite .",
    "however , it is quite uncertain whether dissipative processes can operate efficiently enough to deposit in relativistic electrons ( and positrons ) the copious amounts of energy needed to reproduce observations .",
    "although the details are not well studied , fermi - like acceleration of photons at the shocks formed below the photosphere due to bulk compton scattering can be regarded as an alternative mechanism for producing high energy non - thermal spectra @xcite .",
    "presence of relativistic electrons ( and positrons ) is not required in this scenario , since the energy of the background fluid can be directly transferred to the photons as they propagate .",
    "shocks formed below the photosphere are inevitably mediated by radiation @xcite .",
    "the properties of relativistic radiation mediated shocks have been explored in various astrophysical contexts ( e.g. , shock breakouts ) including grbs .",
    "the most detailed and fully self - consistent analysis of relativistic radiation mediated shocks have been performed by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "although not as sophisticated as the above study , @xcite explored the properties of photon acceleration in the context of shocks within grb jets .",
    "these studies have shown that the existence of accelerated photons above the thermal peak energy is an inherent feature in these shocks .",
    "however , all the above studies assume a one - dimensional stationary planar shock in their analysis , and the obtained spectra are far from those typically observed .",
    "therefore , for a more accurate estimation , a global photon transfer calculation incorporating the multi - dimensional structure of the jet must be performed .",
    "@xcite explored the properties of shocks that are formed in radiation dominated jets .",
    "they claimed that photons which are accelerated at the shock can generate a spectra which are close to the band function .",
    "however , since their argument is based on a simple analytical framework in which the transfer of photons is not solved , it is obvious that detailed calculations are required to form firmer conclusions .",
    "while the previous studies focused on the shocks , any form of large velocity gradients that are present in the outflow can give rise to photon acceleration .",
    "for instance , a fermi - like mechanism can also operate when velocity shear exists in the transverse direction of the outflow , just as in the case of the acceleration of the cosmic rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , grb jets are likely to posses rich internal velocity structures in the transverse directions . for example",
    ", numerical studies which explore the launching mechanism of the relativistic jets suggest that the produced jets have transversely stratified structures in which the bulk lorentz factor increases towards the jet axis @xcite .",
    "since the highly magnetized jets seen in these simulations are cold , subsequent magnetic field dissipation must occur in order to produce a hot fireball which leads to an efficient photospheric emission .",
    "although the flow structure after the dissipative process is highly uncertain , the stratified structure that originated at the central engine may remain even at this stage .",
    "moreover , rich velocity structure can also develop after the launching phase as the jets drill through the progenitor star envelopes . a large number of hydrodynamic simulations regarding the jet propagation show that large velocity gradients appear within the jet ( in radial as well as transverse directions ) due to the interaction with the stellar envelope @xcite .",
    "notably , large velocity gradient in the transverse directions produced by the strong recollimation shocks seen in these studies will likely provide an efficient acceleration site for photons as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "motivated by this background , we explore the photon acceleration within a jet with velocity structures in the transverse direction and its effect on the resulting spectra of the photospheric emissions by solving the transfer of photons .",
    "as mentioned earlier , mainly focusing on the origin of the low energy spectra , @xcite carried out a similar study . by performing a photon transfer calculation",
    ", they evaluated the photospheric emission from a relativistic jet that has a continuously decaying velocity profile in lateral direction @xmath8 at the outer region .",
    "however , while they succeeded in reproducing the spectra below the peak energy , the imposed velocity gradient was not large enough to trigger efficient photon acceleration and , therefore , the high energy part was too soft compared to the band spectra . with the aim to investigate the cases with efficient photon accelerations , we focus on jets that have a velocity shear in the transverse direction",
    ". this can be considered as a limiting case of @xmath9 in @xcite work , a parameter region which was not explored . as a first step",
    ", this study considers a simple stratified two - component jet structure , wherein a highly relativistic spine outflow is surrounded by a wider and less relativistic sheath outflow .",
    "we show , in particular , that the high - energy part of the band spectra ( photon index @xmath10 ) can indeed be reproduced by photons accelerated at the shear layer .",
    "in addition , we also demonstrate that the low - energy part of the spectra ( photon index @xmath6 ) can be reproduced consistently within the framework of the present study when time evolution of the outflow is considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ model ] , we describe our model and numerical procedures .",
    "we present our main results in  [ result ] .",
    "discussions of the implications of our results are given in  [ discussions ] .",
    "the summary of our main findings are given in ",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in the present study , we evaluate the photospheric emissions from an ultra - relativistic outflow which has a spine - sheath jet structure . the spine is defined as a region of conical outflow with a half - opening angle @xmath11 , while the sheath is a region of outflow which surrounds the spine and extends up to an angle of @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ modelpic ] ) .",
    "each region has different fluid properties and a steady radial outflow is assumed .      , and the acceleration continues up to @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the spine and sheath region , respectively .",
    "since the dimensionless entropy of the spine @xmath15 is larger than that of the sheath @xmath16 , the saturation radius and the terminal lorentz factor of the spine ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) are larger than that of the sheath ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the photospheric radius of the spine @xmath21 is smaller than that of the sheath @xmath14 . in our model ,",
    "thermal photons are injected at a the saturation radius of the sheath @xmath22 , and the transfer is solved up to the radius in which the optical depth is much lower than unity .",
    "photons which cross the boundary layer of the spine and sheath multiple times gain energy and produce a non - thermal tail in the resultant spectrum.,width=264 ]      under the assumption that the energy density in the magnetic field and the dissipated kinetic energy are sub - dominant , the fluid properties of the spine and sheath regions are described by the standard adiabatic `` fireball '' model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we give a brief review of the fireball model and show how the radial evolution of the lorentz factor ( velocity ) , @xmath23 , and electron number density , @xmath24 , which are necessary background fluid information for evaluating the photon transfer , is determined .",
    "the dynamics of the fireball can be characterized by three independent parameters , which are the initial fireball radius , @xmath25 , the kinetic luminosity , @xmath26 , and the dimensionless entropy which characterizes the baryon loading , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mass outflow rate and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "initially , the fireball accelerates as it expands by converting its internal energy into kinetic energy ( acceleration phase ) . as a result ,",
    "the bulk lorentz factor of the flow increases with radius , @xmath30 , as @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 is larger than the critical value given by @xmath33 @xcite , the fireball becomes transparent to radiation during the acceleration phase , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the thomson cross section and proton rest mass , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath36 , the fireball becomes transparent after the acceleration has ceased and the flow asymptotically approaches a constant lorentz factor @xmath37 ( coasting phase ) . in this case , the acceleration continues up to the saturation radius , @xmath38 . in the present study ,",
    "we focus on the latter case and consider the parameter space in which @xmath36 is satisfied in both the spine and sheath regions .",
    "hence , the radial evolution of lorentz factor is given by @xmath39    in the relativistically expanding outflow , the electron number density in the comoving frame is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the velocity of the flow normalized by the speed of light .",
    "here , we assumed that there are no strong dissipative processes in the outflow which may create copious pair plasma . since we consider the case of @xmath36 , the electron number density decreases with radius as @xmath42 below the saturation radius ( @xmath43 ) and as @xmath44 at larger radii ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "given the electron number density and bulk lorentz factor of the flow , the optical depth to thomson scatterings for the photons propagating in the _ radial _ direction to reach infinity can be evaluated as @xmath46   & ~~           { \\rm for}~~   r \\leq r_{\\rm s }   , \\\\ % %        \\frac{r_{\\rm ph}}{r } & ~~           { \\rm for}~~ r >",

    "the radial profiles of the fluid quantities ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) in the spine and sheath regions are different , since we impose different values on their fireball parameters ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath32 ) . in the present study , while we assume the same value for @xmath25 in both regions , the dimensionless entropy of the spine , @xmath15 , is taken to be larger than that of the sheath , @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the saturation radius in the spine region , @xmath53 , is larger than that of the sheath , @xmath54 , and the terminal lorentz factor of the former ( @xmath15 ) is larger than that of the latter ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "regarding the evolution of the lorentz factor in the spine and sheath , they have equal values ( @xmath55 ) up to @xmath56 . at larger radii ( @xmath57 ) ,",
    "velocity shear begins to develop and the difference in the lorentz factor increases with radius up to @xmath13 , since the spine is in the acceleration phase while the sheath is in the coasting phase ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "thereafter , the spine also enters the coasting phase ( @xmath18 ) , and the difference in the lorentz factor is constant . in determining the kinetic luminosities of the spine , @xmath58 , and sheath , @xmath59",
    ", we assume that the mass outflow rate is equal in both regions ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "therefore , kinetic luminosity of the spine is larger by a factor of @xmath61 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the photospheric radius in the sheath , @xmath62 , is larger than that in the spine , @xmath21 , by a factor of @xmath63 ( see equation ( [ rph ] ) ) . a schematic picture of the employed model is given in fig .",
    "[ modelpic ] .",
    "hereafter , the quantities corresponding to the spine and sheath regions are denoted by subscript @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "having determined the background fluid properties ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , we evaluate the resultant photospheric emission by solving the propagation of photons which are injected far below the photosphere .",
    "the photon transfer is evaluated by performing a three - dimensional test particle monte - carlo simulation . in grb jets ,",
    "opacity of photons is strongly dominated by the scatterings with electrons .",
    "therefore , we neglect the absorption process and only consider the scattering process by the electrons in our calculations .",
    "furthermore we do not take into account the thermal motion of the electrons in evaluating the scattering for simplicity .",
    "initially , the photons are injected within the jet at the surface of a fixed radius where the velocity shear begins to develop @xmath22 . for the cases considered in this study , @xmath66 is always located far below the photosphere ( @xmath67 ) . therefore , a tight coupling between the photons and matter is expected .",

    "is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the radiation constant .",
    "hence , we adopt the temperature at the corresponding radius given by above equation @xmath70 for the comoving temperature of the injected photons . while the photons are isotropic in the comoving frame , they are strongly beamed in the laboratory frame due to the doppler boosting effect . due to this effect , the radiation intensity of the blackbody emission in the laboratory frame is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the bulk lorentz factor of the flow at @xmath73 determined from equation ( [ gamma ] ) . here ,",

    "are drawn from a source of photons given by the above equation .",
    "it is emphasized that the results of our calculation are insensitive to the assumed position of the injection radius as long as @xmath79 is satisfied .",
    "this is because , at a radius far below the photosphere ( @xmath80 ) , the photon energy distribution evaluated by solving the photon transfer does not deviate from the planck distribution if velocity shear is not present ( see next section ) , and its temperature evolution is well described by equation ( [ tev ] ) .",
    "the temperature of the injected photons in the spine , @xmath81 , is higher than that in the sheath , @xmath82 , by a factor of @xmath83 , since the kinetic luminosity of the former is higher by a factor of @xmath63 . correspondingly , the luminosity of the injected photons in the laboratory frame ( @xmath84 ) in the spine is higher than that of the sheath by a factor @xmath85 .",
    "after the photons are injected , we track their path within the jet in three - dimensions by performing monte - carlo simulations (  [ mccode ] ) until they reach the outer or inner boundary of the calculation . using spherical coordinates ( @xmath30,@xmath86,@xmath87 ) , the outer boundary @xmath30 is set at a radius @xmath88 where the photons can be safely considered to have escaped since the optical depth is @xmath89 . while there is no boundary in the @xmath87 direction , outer boundary in the @xmath86 direction",
    "is set at @xmath90 which corresponds to the edge of the whole jet . as for the inner boundary",
    ", we adopt a radius slightly below the injection radius @xmath91 . for photons which have reached the outer boundaries",
    ", we assume that they escape freely to @xmath92 without being scattered or absorbed . on the other hand , we assume that the photons are simply absorbed in the inner boundary",
    ". it is noted , however , that the fraction of absorbed photons is negligible , since most of the photons in ultra - relativistic outflows are strongly collimated due to the relativistic beaming effect and essentially streamed outward ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "these photons are highly anisotropic and mostly concentrated within a cone of half - opening angle @xmath93 in the direction of the fluid velocity ( radial direction ) at the last scattering position .",
    "hence , the observed emission spectra depend significantly on the angle between the direction to the observer and the jet axis , @xmath94 . in the present study , we evaluate the spectrum for observers located at direction @xmath94 by recording all photons which have reached the outer boundary that are propagating in direction within a cone of half - opening angle @xmath95 , which is small enough to regard that the emission is uniform within the cone . from the recorded photon flux , we calculate the isotropic equivalent luminosity by multiplying the photon flux by a factor @xmath96 , where @xmath97 $ ] is the solid angle of the cone .      here",
    "we briefly describe the monte - carlo code used to solve the photon transfer .",
    "as noted previously , we neglect the thermal motions of the electrons and only take into account the scattering processes .",
    "hence , the rest frame of the fluid is equivalent to that of the electrons . under the above assumptions ,",
    "the propagation of the photons is performed by directly tracking the path of the individual photons in the three - dimensional space of the calculation .",
    "each photon has a specified position propagation direction and frequency , and these quantities are updated by using a uniform random number .    within the jet , the photons travel along straight paths before they are scattered by the electrons .",
    "firstly , the code determines the distance for the photons to travel before the scattering by drawing the corresponding optical depth @xmath98 .",
    "the probability for the selected optical depth to be in the range of [ @xmath98 , @xmath99 is given as @xmath100 .",
    "then , from the given optical depth @xmath98 , the distance @xmath101 to the scattering event is determined from the integration along the straight path of photons which can be expressed as @xmath102 where @xmath78 is the angle between the direction of fluid velocity and photon . here",
    ", @xmath103 is the total cross section for the electron scattering and is given as @xmath104 in our code , where @xmath105 is the total cross section for compton scattering , and @xmath106 is the frequency of the photon in electron ( fluid ) comoving frame .",
    "( the frequency @xmath106 is evaluated by performing a lorentz transformation using local fluid velocity ) .",
    "given the distance @xmath101 from the above equation , we update the position of the photons to the scattering position by shifting them from the initial position with the given distance in the initial direction of photon propagation .",
    "note that , unlike the case of equation ( [ tau ] ) , the optical depth calculated by equation ( [ taucal ] ) is not limited to photons propagating in the radial direction .",
    "the path of integration is along the straight path of photons which can be in an arbitrary direction . for a given value of @xmath98 ,",
    "the distance @xmath101 strongly depends on the propagation direction of the photons in the case of a relativistic flow ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "as is obvious from the above equation , the mean free path of photons @xmath107^{-1}$ ] is quite sensitive to the photon propagation direction , since the factor @xmath108 varies largely from @xmath109 ( for @xmath110 ) up to @xmath111 ( for @xmath112 ) depending on the value of @xmath78 .",
    "hence , a photon tends to travel a larger distance in the fluid velocity ( radial ) direction since the mean free path of the photon tends to be larger .",
    "hereafter , quantities measured in the comoving frame of the fluid ( electron ) are denoted by tilde .    in evaluating the integration in equations ( [ taucal ] ) ,",
    "we employ two different methods depending on the frequency and position of the photon . for photons located above the saturation radius @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) that satisfy @xmath115 ( @xmath116 )",

    "first , the four - momentum of the photon before the scattering is lorentz transformed into the fluid rest frame . for the photons that satisfy @xmath115 , the differential thompson cross section is used , while the differential compton cross section is used at higher energies ( @xmath126 ) . the scattering angle or equivalently the propagation direction of the outgoing photon in the fluid rest frame",

    "this is due to the fact that the coupling between the photon and matter is not complete near the photosphere @xmath171 as shown in the previous studies @xcite . as a result , photons which decouple with the matter at moderate optical depth ( @xmath172 )",

    "the off - axis component becomes prominent at low energies because the doppler factor is smaller which leads to a lower peak photon energy @xmath175 .",

    "tend to lose energy ( downscatter ) due to the same reason .",
    "consequently , some fraction of photons which cross the boundary layer multiple times can gain energy , since the energy gain by the upscattering overcome the downscattering in average .",
    "this mechanism can give rise to a non - thermal spectrum at the high frequencies .    to obtain a rough estimation of the average energy gain and loss rate ( @xmath190 ) for each process ,",

    "since the angle @xmath78 is conserved along the photon s path in the case of a plane parallel flow , the typical energy gain rate by the upscattering in the spine region can be evaluated by substituting @xmath193 and @xmath194 in equation ( [ rate ] ) and is given as @xmath195 similarly , the typical energy loss rate by the downscattering in the sheath region is given as @xmath196 from the above equations , it is clear that the energy gain by the upscattering overcomes the energy loss by the downscattering ( @xmath197 > 1 $ ] ) .",
    "it is also clear that the efficiency of the acceleration per each cycle of crossing @xmath198 $ ] is controlled by the ratio between the bulk lorentz factor of the two regions @xmath199 and increases as the ratio becomes larger .",
    "it is worth noting that , while the _ average _ value of the energy ratio @xmath190 roughly obeys the above equations , the dispersion around the average value is large , since it depends quite sensitively on the scattering angles ( @xmath187 and @xmath188 ; see eq .",

    "the non - thermal component is hardest when the observer angle is aligned to the boundary layer @xmath225 and becomes softer as the deviation between @xmath94 and @xmath11 becomes larger , simply because the boundary layer corresponds to the site of photon acceleration . as mentioned earlier , the photon acceleration becomes inefficient when the photon energy becomes large enough so that the recoil of electrons can not be neglected ( klein - nishina effect ) .",

    "regarding the upscatterings , the energy ratio @xmath270 for photons that cross the boundary from the sheath to spine region ( green line ) only once ( @xmath274 ) is relatively small because a large fraction of these photons experience the crossing when the velocity shear is not fully developed ( @xmath275 ) . for photons with a larger number of crossings ( @xmath276 ) , a large fraction of the photons experience the last crossing at @xmath277 , where the velocity shear is fully developed .",

    "[ gev ] .    on the other hand , the spectral slope below the peak energy is only moderately sensitive to the values of the parameters and can be well approximated by a blackbody emission from the off - axis region ( @xmath332 ) of a sphere at a radius @xmath333 as in the case of a uniform jet . in all cases ,",
    "the low energy photon indices are roughly @xmath334 which is harder than the typical observed value ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is noted , however , that this does not imply that the low energy slope can not be reproduced within this scenario .",
    "for instance , while the instantaneous spectrum is hard , the time integration can lead to a softer spectrum if the evolution history of the outflow is considered . to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us consider the case when the dimensionless entropies of the spine - sheath jet have evolved from @xmath243 and @xmath211 ( initial stage ) to @xmath306 and @xmath233 ( later stage ) , while the kinetic luminosity is fixed as @xmath307 and @xmath308 .",
    "we illustrate the resultant spectrum in fig .",
    "[ g400spose ] under the assumption that a nearly equal time period is spent in the two stages .",
    "the black solid line shows the overall spectrum , and the red and green solid lines show the contribution from the initial and later stages , respectively .",
    "since the peak energy and the luminosity vary with the dimensionless entropy of the flow roughly as @xmath335 , they are smaller by a factor @xmath336 , in the later stage . as a result , while the peak energy and luminosity of the overall spectra is determined by the initial stage , at lower energies , contribution from the later stage becomes dominant .",
    "due to the superposition of the two components , the spectrum below the peak becomes softer than that of the individual component , so that a typical observed spectrum ( @xmath337 ) is reproduced .",
    "note also that the high energy part of the overall spectrum largely resembles typical ones from observations .",
    "hence , we conclude that typical observed spectra can be successfully reproduced when a time evolution is considered . direction may also be a possible origin for the soft low energy slope @xcite . ]      as shown in the previous section , our results have a quite strong dependence on the observer angle @xmath94 .",
    "while strong non - thermal emission can be seen when the observer angle is close to the angle in which a velocity shear is present ( @xmath338 ) , the non - thermal feature tends to be weaker for observer angles far from @xmath11 .",
    "this tendency seems to contradict the fact that most of the observed grbs have non - thermal features in their spectra .",
    "however , we emphasize that this difficulty can be overcome if the jet possesses a more complex structure .",
    "for example , if the jet has more than two components and velocity shear is present at multiple angles more closely spaced than @xmath95 , photons from the acceleration regions will be prominent for all observers lying within the opening angle of the jet ( @xmath339 ) . even in the case of a simple spine - sheath jet ,",
    "if the angular boundary of the spine and sheath ( @xmath11 ) varied rapidly with time , the accelerated non - thermal photons would be observable across a broad range of angles .",
    "it should be also noted that the structure need not be in the direction of @xmath86 .",
    "strong velocity shear in the azimuthal ( @xmath87 ) direction and/or radial direction due to the presence of turbulence or shocks can also provide an acceleration sites for the photons @xcite .",
    "any structure showing strong velocity shear within an angle @xmath95 from the line - of - sight can give rise to a non - thermal component above the thermal peak .",
    "hence , it is expected that jet having a rich structure and/or rapid time variability will be naturally accompanied by non - thermal emission , irrespective of the observer angle .",
    "the origin of the structure and variability could be due to the nature of the central engine @xcite and/or the propagation of jet through the envelope of the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "our calculations have shown that the peak energy of the observed spectra can be roughly approximated as the thermal peak of a blackbody emission from the surface of optical depth @xmath340 ( @xmath341 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the peak luminosity shows rough agreement with that of the emission from @xmath342 ( @xmath343 ) .",
    "this result is valid for an adiabatic fireball which has a photosphere above the saturation radius ( @xmath344 ) ( see  [ uniform ] for detail ) . as a result ,",
    "the peak energy and luminosity are given by @xmath345 and @xmath346 respectively . and",
    "@xmath1 on the fireball parameters can be significantly different ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is worthy to note that comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ epeak ] ) and ( [ lpeak ] ) with the observed peak energy and luminosity will enable us to constrain the properties ( fireball parameters ) of the grb jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "] derived from observations , there is an empirical relation between the peak energy and luminosity @xcite that is roughly given by @xmath347 therefore , in order to reproduce the empirical relation from the photospheric emission , the parameters of the fireball ( @xmath25 , @xmath32 , and @xmath26 ) must satisfy @xmath348    another important ingredient for comparison with observations is the emission efficiency @xmath349 .",
    "observations of the afterglows suggest a quite high grb efficiency in the range @xmath350 , with a typical value at @xmath351 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this gives another constraint on the fireball parameters which can be written as @xmath352 to sum up , the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 relation as well as the high efficiency can be reproduced when equations ( [ const1 ] ) and ( [ const2 ] ) are satisfied .    in fig .",
    "[ eplpfig ] , we show the calculated spectra for a uniform jet ( @xmath353 ) in which both conditions are fulfilled .",
    "the adopted values of the parameters are summarized in the figure .",
    "the red , green , blue and purple lines correspond to the cases of @xmath354 , @xmath306 , @xmath243 and @xmath355 , respectively .",

    "it can be confirmed that the photospheric emission can indeed reproduce the empirical @xmath0-@xmath1 relation while at the same time retaining a high efficiency when the two conditions are satisfied .      in the present study , we have assumed an infinitesimal width for the boundary layer of the spine and sheath region .",
    "however , in reality , the boundary layer is expected to possess a finite width due to the interaction between the two regions .",
    "firstly , by definition , photons are closely coupled to the matter below the photosphere , and , therefore , will couple the two regions due to compton friction ( radiative viscosity ) .",
    "in particular , this effect will be important in the regions where the energy is dominated by radiation ( @xmath357 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "secondly , even in the absence of radiation coupling , the kelvin - helmholtz instability should grow whenever velocity shear is present ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these effects will relax the discontinuous change in the velocity and lead to broadening of the boundary layer .",
    "although the detail analysis of the resultant jet structure is beyond the scope of the present study , these effects will reduce the acceleration of the photons . to quantify the effect of the broadening of the boundary layer on the spectra , here",
    "we compute the photon propagation within a spine - sheath jet having a boundary layer with finite width in transverse direction .",
    "we explore the dependence on the width of the boundary layer by considering cases with various widths .    in modeling the jet structure , we added slight modifications in the original spine - sheath jet model considered in the present study .",
    "the boundary layer is defined as a region having finite transverse width @xmath358 that is located in the range @xmath359 , where @xmath360 and @xmath361 .",
    "correspondingly , the spine and sheath regions are limited to the ranges @xmath362 and @xmath363 , respectively . while the fluid properties ( fireball parameters ) of the spine and sheath region are determined in the same way as in the cases of infinitesimal boundary layer (  [ spst ] ) , the properties of the boundary layer are determined by simply imposing a linear interpolation of the fireball parameters from the two regions .",
    "hence , the initial radius of the fireball is fixed in all regions ( @xmath364 ) , and the transverse distribution of the dimensionless entropy and kinetic luminosity within is given by @xmath365 and @xmath366 respectively .",
    "hence , the profile of the velocity ( lorentz factor ) and density within the jet is continuous in all regions .",
    "having determined the background fluid properties , the propagation of photons is calculated in the same way as in the case of an infinitesimal boundary layer .",
    "black body emission is injected at the surface of a fixed radius @xmath367 with a comoving temperature determined from the fireball parameters (  [ iniph ] ) .",
    "then , photons are propagated until they reach the outer boundary of the calculation range ( see  [ phtr ] for detail ) .    in figs .",
    "[ g42sm ] and [ g41sm ] , we show the obtained spectra for a stratified jet in which the fireball parameters for the spine and sheath regions are identical to those employed in case i ( @xmath243 and @xmath257 ) and case ii ( @xmath243 and @xmath258 ) discussed in  [ crdiss ] .",
    "the various lines reflect the width of the boundary layer @xmath358 . while the thick red line displays the case for the infinitesimal width ( @xmath312 ) , the thin green , blue , purple , light blue , yellow , black and red lines display the cases for the finite widths of @xmath313 , @xmath314 , @xmath315 , @xmath316 , @xmath317 , @xmath318 and @xmath319 , respectively . in all cases ,",
    "the observer angle is fixed at @xmath225 . as expected , the non - thermal component becomes softer as the width of the boundary layer broadens due to the reduction in efficiency of photon acceleration .",
    "note that , while the broadening of the boundary layer causes the spectra to depart from the high energy tail of the band function for case i , good agreement is found at @xmath368 for case ii .",
    "therefore , although a large gradient in the lorentz factor is required , we emphasize that the broadening of the boundary layer does not rule out the photon acceleration mechanism in a stratified jet as the origin of the high energy spectra in the prompt emission .    from the figures , it is seen that , in order to provide an efficient acceleration site comparable to the case of boundary layer with infinitesimal with , the bulk lorentz factor must vary by a factor of few roughly within an angle @xmath369 .",
    "as is expected , this condition is roughly equivalent to the condition for the boundary layer to be optically thin above the radius where the velocity shear begins to develop ( @xmath298 ) .",
    "this can be shown as follows .",
    "the typical angle between the photon propagation direction and the fluid velocity ( radial ) direction is roughly @xmath370 .",
    "hence , at a given radius @xmath30 , the typical distance that the photons must propagate to cross the boundary layer is roughly given as @xmath371 .",
    "the above estimate is valid as long as @xmath372 . on the other hand , the mean free path for the typical photon at a given radius @xmath30",
    "is roughly given by @xmath373 .",
    "thus , the typical optical depth for a photons to cross a boundary layer of finite width can be estimated as @xmath374 . since @xmath375 and @xmath376 are @xmath377 ( @xmath378 ) and @xmath379 ( @xmath380 ) for case i ( case ii ) , respectively , @xmath381 is obtained at @xmath56 for @xmath382 . as a result , since @xmath383 decreases as the radius increases , when the condition @xmath382 is satisfied , the boundary layer is optically thin to crossings at @xmath298 .",
    "lastly , let us briefly comment on a similar calculation performed by @xcite . in their study , photon propagation within a jet having a continuously decaying velocity profile @xmath8 at the outer region ( @xmath384 ) is explored .",
    "since the efficiency of photon acceleration increases as the difference in velocity ( lorentz factor ) between the spine and sheath region increases , their calculation should also show non - thermal high energy photons when a large velocity gradient is considered .",
    "indeed , although not so prominent as is shown by our results , signs of photon acceleration are also reported in their study .",
    "while only a thermal component is present when a relatively small velocity gradient ( @xmath385 ) is assumed , power - law excess above the thermal peak energy appears in the calculated spectra when a large velocity gradient ( @xmath386 ) is assumed .",
    "therefore , as the velocity gradient enlarges , we expect to find more efficient acceleration as is seen in the present study .",
    "since the photon number density is significant inside the jet ( @xmath387 ) , photons are subject to @xmath388 attenuation once they exceed the threshold energy for the process .",
    "the threshold energy is given by @xmath389 $ ] , where @xmath390 and @xmath391 are the energy of the target photons and angle between the propagation direction of the target and incident photons , respectively .",
    "since the photons are basically advected in the radial direction within a small angle @xmath95 , the collision angle of the photons is expected to be in a range @xmath392 .",
    "hence , for photons confined in an angle @xmath95 , the minimum value of the threshold energy ( @xmath393 ) can be roughly estimated as @xmath394 .",
    "for the cases considered in the present study ( @xmath395 ) , the photon energies do not exceed @xmath396 by much and , therefore , the pair creation process is negligible for the majority of the photons .",
    "however , for the small fraction of photons which propagate with a large angle ( @xmath397 ) with respect to the radial direction , this effect can become non - negligible .",
    "in particular , pair annihilation may play an important role for the high energy photons which are being accelerated , since scattering with a large angle with respect to the fluid velocity ( radial ) direction is favored for gaining photon energy ( see  [ model ] for detail ) . to check this ,",
    "we have compared our results with those obtained by discarding the photons which have exceeded the threshold energy obtained by substituting the angle between the photon propagation direction and radial direction for @xmath391 and the highest photon energy appear in the calculation @xmath398 for @xmath390 .",
    "indeed , we find that only a small fraction of photons are absorbed and the change in the spectrum is negligible .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath388 attenuation effect does not affect the obtained results .    the flow within the fireball is expected to be fully ionized , and the effect of free - free absorption should also be discussed . for an electron - proton plasma ,",
    "the frequency averaged free - free opacity can be roughly written as @xmath399 @xcite in the fluid rest frame . in the laboratory frame , by using a doppler factor , the opacity can be expressed as @xmath400 . since photons advect in the radial direction within an angle @xmath95 ( @xmath401 ) , the optical depth for photons which have propagated from @xmath402 to the observer ( infinity ) can be roughly estimated as @xmath403 @xmath404 , we have assumed @xmath405 and used equations ( [ ne ] ) and ( [ tev ] ) in the last equality .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that free - free absorption is also negligible .",
    "fermi observations have shown that a fraction ( @xmath406 ) of grbs are accompanied by significant emissions at energies well above @xmath407 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within the framework of our model ,",
    "the energy of the photons is limited by the bulk lorentz factor of the flow as @xmath408 (  [ result ] ) .",
    "hence , in order to generate emissions at @xmath409 , large bulk lorentz factors such as @xmath410 are required . alternatively ,",
    "if we consider the presence of relativistic electrons due to some kind of dissipative processes within the flow ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , lower values are allowed for the bulk lorentz factor . by denoting the maximum lorentz factor of the electrons measured in the rest frame of the fluid as @xmath411 , the lower limit on the bulk lorentz factor to produce @xmath330 photons decreases as @xmath412 .",
    "therefore , within this picture , grbs with intense @xmath330 emissions may imply the presence of fluid components with very high bulk lorentz factors ( @xmath410 ) or a dissipative process producing relativistic electrons within the flow . in either case",
    ", pair cascades due to @xmath388 attenuation may play an important role @xcite , and the details of the process and its effect on the observed photon spectra are beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "it should be also noted that photons with energies above and below @xmath263 may have distinct origins .",
    "for example , it is widely discussed that @xmath413 emission can result from energy dissipation by external shocks similar to afterglow emission @xcite , due to the smooth temporal decay seen in lightcurve of many lat detected grbs .",
    "therefore , one possible interpretation is that , while emission at @xmath414 has a photospheric origin as discussed in the present study , higher energy photons are independently produced at the external shock .",
    "in the present study , we have explored photospheric emission from ultra - relativistic jets which have a velocity shear in the transverse direction . for the jet structure ,",
    "we considered a two component outflow in which a fast spine jet is embedded in a slower sheath region .",
    "the fluid properties such as electron number density @xmath415 and bulk lorentz factor @xmath52 are determined by applying the adiabatic fireball model in each region independently .",
    "initially thermal photons are injected at a radius far below the photosphere ( @xmath416 ) in which the velocity shear begins to develop . using a monte - carlo technique , injected photons propagate until they reach the outer boundary , located at a radius where the optical depth is small ( @xmath417 ) .",
    "the following is a summary of the main results and conclusions of the present study .",
    "\\1 . due to the presence of velocity shear , photons that cross",
    "the boundary between the spine and sheath ( @xmath11 ) multiple times can gain energy through a fermi - like acceleration mechanism .",
    "the acceleration process at the boundary layer can proceed efficiently until the photon reaches an energy where the klein - nishina effect becomes important . as a result ,",
    "the maximum energy of the accelerated photons is limited by the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow as @xmath418 .",
    "these accelerated photons produce a non - thermal component above the thermal peak in the observed spectra .",
    "although it depends strongly on the flow profile , the non - thermal component can reproduce the high energy spectra of typical grbs ( @xmath419 ) .",
    "the accelerated photons may also be capable of explaining the extra hard power - law component above the bump of the thermal - like peak seen in some peculiar bursts ( grb 090510 , 090902b , 090926a ) .",
    "the efficiency of the acceleration is sensitive to the relative difference of the bulk lorentz factor in the two regions ( @xmath251 ) , the optical depth at the radius where the velocity shear begins to develop ( @xmath420 ) and the optical depth for a photon to cross the boundary transition layer of the two regions ( @xmath383 ) . for an efficient acceleration ,",
    "larger values are favored for @xmath251 and @xmath420 , while smaller value is favored for @xmath383 , since both the energy gain per crossing and probability for the photons to cross the boundary layer increase .",
    "the increase in the efficiency leads to a harder high energy non - thermal component in the observed spectra .",
    "the observed spectra strongly depend on the observer angle @xmath94 due to the relativistic beaming effect .",
    "the high energy non - thermal component is hardest when the observer is aligned to the boundary layer ( @xmath421 ) and becomes softer as the difference between @xmath94 and @xmath11 becomes larger .",
    "additionally , the non - thermal component is most prominent for an observer located near the boundary layer ( @xmath422 ) , and it becomes significantly weaker or absent when the observer angle is far from the boundary layer ( @xmath423 ) . in order for the intense non - thermal component to be seen for all observers in a range @xmath424 , a multi - component jet in which velocity shears are present in an interval of angles smaller than @xmath95 is required .",
    "the observed spectra below the peak energy are determined by the majority of thermal photons which have not experienced acceleration .",
    "the spectra @xmath425 are somewhat softer than that expected from the rayleigh - jeans part of a single - temperature blackbody emission ( @xmath176 ) , since the emission is a superposition of photons released at various angles which have different observed temperatures .",
    "this is still much harder than the typical low energy spectral index of the observed grbs ( @xmath426 ) , implying that the steady outflow component has difficulty in reproducing the overall spectra .",
    "hence , time evolution of outflow properties seems to be required .",
    "it is indeed shown that time - integrated spectra of an unsteady outflow can reproduce the low energy spectra due to the multi - temperature effect .",
    "photons begin to decouple from the matter below the photosphere typically at @xmath427 , irrespective of the imposed fireball parameters ( @xmath128 , @xmath26 and @xmath32 ) in the background fluid .",
    "the resultant peak energy @xmath0 and luminosity @xmath1 can be roughly approximated by the corresponding values of a blackbody emission from the surface of @xmath428 and @xmath429 , respectively .",
    "the empirical @xmath0-@xmath1 relation can be well reproduced by considering the difference in the outflow properties of individual sources .",
