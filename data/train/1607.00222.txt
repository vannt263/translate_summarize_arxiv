    "practically every quantum system experiences some kind of coupling to its environment and in many cases a realistic modelling requires the inclusion of quantum dissipative processes@xcite .",
    "such interactions with the environment typically lead to a decay of quantum mechanical coherence within the subsystem of interest that is known as decoherence or dephasing and often affects the dynamics in a non - negligible way . when the system - bath coupling becomes strong or when the environmental correlation decay becomes slow it can be insufficient to treat the environment as a constant entity simply acting on the system but instead the reaction of the external degrees of freedom to the system dynamics also has to be considered . accounting for these non - markovian effects in a complete and correct way",
    "is not an easy task as besides the system dynamics also the finite bath - memory has to be incorporated in the equations of motion .",
    "a powerful and widely used method that allows such an exact treatment is provided by the path - integral approach@xcite which exactly takes into account the environment excitations via so called influence functionals for the degrees of freedom of the quantum system@xcite .",
    "this formalism has been applied in a variety of fields of both physics and chemistry such as energy transfer dynamics@xcite , landau - zener transitions@xcite , quantum mechanical brownian motion@xcite and semiconductor quantum dots with and without optical driving@xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been applied to systems with bosonic and fermionic baths@xcite , ohmic and super - ohmic@xcite environments and can also be used to include multiple baths . however , in some cases the path - integral approach becomes impractical , because depending on the type of environmental interaction the influence functional can not always be obtained easily . on the other hand a completely microscopic description of the environment is not always necessary because many dissipative processes are well known to be correctly described in the markov limit and a simplified or even parametric treatment of the environment is sufficient . in these cases",
    "a realistic modelling is usually achieved by simply adding phenomenological non - hamiltonian contributions to the equations of motion of the reduced system as it is done , e.g. , in the lindblad formalism@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that in a new generalized formulation the framework of the path - integral method allows to treat such non - hamiltonian dynamics on equal footing with the hamiltonian part of the equations of motion and can therefore also be used for models that describe some parts of the environment by phenomenological rates while fully accounting for all non - markovian effects induced by other couplings .",
    "this is not obvious , because the path - integral method usually relies on describing the dynamics in terms of the time - evolution operator which yields purely hamiltonian dynamics . more specifically here",
    "we present the path - integral formalism for a finite dimensional system that exhibits arbitrary non - hamiltonian relaxation and a coupling to an arbitrary number of microscopic harmonic oscillator modes that is of the pure - dephasing type , i.e. , the coupling does not induce transitions between the finite basis states . after defining the model and establishing our new formalism in section  [ model ] we apply it to a strongly confined semiconductor quantum dot coupled to a continuum of longitudinal acoustic phonons in section  [ application ] .",
    "the new method allows for an unbiased study of the interplay of the carrier - phonon coupling with the presence of radiative decay that is due to external field modes even in the regime of high temperatures and strong driving that is presented in section  [ application]-a . by exemplarily comparing the path - integral calculations with a markovian master equation",
    "we also show that the new formalism can serve as an important benchmark tool . in section",

    "moreover , the derivation of the hybrid approach in ref .   made explicit use of special properties that are only fulfilled for constant resonant excitation .",
    "therefore the present work also drastically extends the parameter range accessible with the path - integral approach if one needs to include the effects of cavity losses , which in many cases play a crucial role for the system dynamics . here ,",
    "we have compared the results obtained from the hybrid approach for resonant excitation , shown as black dots in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , with the path - integral method for both temperatures . for low temperatures the results",
    "are identical , while at higher temperature small deviations become visible .",
    "similar to our previous comparison with the weak - coupling theory also here the path - integral method serves as an excellent benchmark to explore the limits of the applicability of less rigorous methods .",
    "we have presented an extension to the numerical path - integral formalism previously used to calculate the reduced density matrix of a time - dependent few level system coupled to a set of harmonic oscillator modes that allows a natural and systematic inclusion of non - hamiltonian dynamics within the path integral framework .",
    "our combined method shows a way how to go beyond the representation of the path - integral formalism that relies on using the time - evolution operator and thus can be used to add arbitrary linear operations acting on the reduced density matrix to the equations of motion .",
    "we applied this new method to an optically coupled semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) where the coupling to longitudinal acoustic phonons is treated non - perturbatively for different optical excitation conditions and different environmental effects that are described in the markov limit by corresponding phenomenological rates .",
    "the combined lindblad and path - integral method turns out to be a highly valuable tool for the treatment of optically coupled qds with strong phonon interaction and similar quantum dissipative systems for a number of reasons .",
    "first of all , it allows to treat the deformation potential coupling to longitudinal acoustic phonons , which has been identified as the major decoherence mechanism in strongly confined qds , in a numerically exact way that includes multi - phonon processes and all non - markovian effects .",
    "this makes it possible to explore the regimes of arbitrarily strong qd - phonon coupling and both low and high temperatures in a non - perturbative way . here",
    ", it is worth noting that within the path integral approach higher temperatures are actually easier to deal with as the memory time becomes shorter and thus less memory steps are needed while the scope of some approximate methods that explicitly truncate the phonon subspace is restricted to lower temperatures .",
    "besides the phonon coupling also the optical excitation can be chosen arbitrarily as the formalism is able to deal with both weak and strong driving , constant and pulsed excitation and also rapid changes of the excitation parameters that can prevent an adiabatic evolution of the coupled light - matter system .",
    "this also includes situations with chirped excitation or with multiple overlapping pulses of different frequency where the introduction of a suitable basis of photon - dressed states as needed by some schemes becomes non - obvious as the rotating frames naturally associated with each pulse differ .",
    "moreover , the method can be used to calculate all elements of the reduced density matrix in the original frame of reference which not only gives access to the qd occupations , but also to the coherences of the reduced system .",
    "the inclusion of processes described by rate equations within the path - integral formalism that is made possible by the present work allows taking into account other loss channels that are relevant in typical experimental situations involving qds .",
    "for example the presented method has already been successfully used to include electron tunneling effects in photocurrent measurements using off - resonant two - pulse and two - color excitation@xcite .    in our first application we discussed the combined effects of the radiative decay and the phonon scattering on the driven stationary non - equilibrium state of a two - level qd for",
    "both resonant and off - resonant excitation showing that there is a non - monotonic dependence of the stationary exciton occupation on the driving strength .",
    "this is not expected in both limiting cases where either the dot phonon interaction or the radiative decay provide the only environment coupling .",
    "so far no unbiased approach was formulated for studying such combination effects .",
    "we then used the path - integral results to explore the range of validity of a weak - coupling method that treats the phonon coupling perturbatively and found for strong driving in the regime of detuned excitation at high temperatures significant deviations between the two methods while otherwise the weak - coupling theory works well over wide parameter ranges .",
    "finally , we applied our new formalism to the case of a qd coupled to a single cavity mode and analyzed the exciton lifetime that is limited due to photon losses of the cavity for different detunings of the optical mode from the qd resonance at low and very high temperatures .",
    "the combined lindblad and path - integral method has also been used as a benchmark to test a previously developed hybrid approach that was limited to resonant excitation .",
