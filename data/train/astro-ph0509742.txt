    "aat matched @xmath7-enhanced isochrones to be29 providing a reasonably good fit within previous determinations of the cluster redding and metallicity , although they do not have stars on the rgb higher than the rc .",
    "however as shown in figure 11 , our matches to @xmath7-enhanced isochrones are markedly different .",
    "while some of the differences can be attributed to the different isochrones used , the primary difference comes from trying to match our 2 spectroscopically confirmed member stars above the rc .",
    "matching the entire cmd with @xmath7-enhanced isochrones requires one to make be29 have _ solar _ [ fe / h ] .",

    "an additional method that comes near to matching the cmd , is to decrease the age to @xmath87 gyr , however this match is inconsistent with the finding of aat , who find that the age difference of be29 and ngc 2243 ( @xmath88 gyr ) can not be more than 0.5 gyr .",
    "additionally the reddening determined must be 50% higher that the highest previous estimate and double that found by aat .",
    "we find that be29 can not be consistently fit with @xmath7-enhanced isochrones , therefore to account for the variable @xmath7 element enhancements found in cbvmpr more complex models are needed .",
    "we refer the reader to  6.2 in @xcite for further discussion of the high resolution studies . using the same isochrones for be29 and sa1 ( see below ) , we find that be29 _ is _ the most distant known open cluster ( @xmath89 ) in the galaxy , as found by ( * ? ? ?",

    "our sa1 rv ( @xmath90 km s@xmath4 ) is smaller by @xmath91 9 km s@xmath4 than the sa1 velocity obtained by cbvmpr .",
    "we note that two of our sa1 stars  572 and 693  were the only stars observed by cbvmpr for this cluster ; cbvmpr find rvs of ( 104.4 , 104.8 ) km s@xmath4 for these two stars , respectively , while our survey finds ( 98.2 , 95.3 ) km s@xmath4 .",
    "thus , while both studies find small rv differences between the two stars , the relatively large rv offset between studies persists and is apparently not related to a difference in the stellar samples . while cbvmpr does observe at much higher @xmath49 than we do , the magnitude of the rv offset is significantly larger than the estimated uncertainty in the mean cluster motion for the two surveys .",
    "moreover , we have found no net zero point offset in checks of our standard star rvs by comparison to the iau values to our measurements , as shown in table 4 .",
    "the same template stars were used for the rv determination of all of the clusters and no large offset is found in be20 , 29 , 39 or bh176 .",
    "thus , the origin of the systematic offset between the surveys is not clear .",
    "however , since we observed the same stars as cbvmpr , we can determine that the four stars selected as members are indeed consistent with the work of cbvmpr .",
    "the sparse cmd of sa1 , and lack of bright giants , limits our ability to achieve a reliable isochrone match , though our rv members provide crucial benchmarks at the magnitude of the red clump . to improve the photometry depth and provide a better match",

    "an age of 4.5 - 5 gyr is derived , since the 4 gyr isochrones do not match well the msto .",

    "the corresponding heliocentric distance for these values ranges from 11.8 to 13.5 kpc ( see table 12 ) .",

    "this information is useful because a large number of our candidates have not been observed spectroscopically , but if we have confidence that the photometrically - selected candidates are likely to be members , they can potentially help constrain the likely positions of the rgb and rc sequences in the cluster cmds as well as point to the effectiveness of these kinds of selections for picking spectroscopic samples in future studies .",
    "the rv membership success rate among washington@xmath1 selected rgb stars with rvs is ( 100% , 53% , 100% ) for ( sa1 , be39 , and be20 ) respectively .",

    "the present use of the washington@xmath1 technique is not completely analogous to these dsph studies , because here we have targeted _ any _ giant star candidates for spectroscopic follow - up without regard to cmd position ( because in some cases the location of the rgb was not certain ) , whereas the dsph studies applied both washington@xmath1 selected of giant candidates _ and _ specific cmd location pre - filtering on the stars samples .",
