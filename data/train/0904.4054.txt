    "it has been known for several decades that the kinematics of disk galaxies exhibit a mass discrepancy ( e.g. bosma , 1978 ; bosma & van der kruit , 1979 ; rubin , thonnard & ford , 1980 ) .",
    "more precisely , spirals show an inner baryon dominance region ( e.g. athanassoula et al .",
    "1987 , persic & salucci , 1988 , palunas & williams 2000 ) , whose size ranges between 1 and 3 disk exponential lengthscales according to the galaxy luminosity ( salucci and persic , 1999 ) , inside which the observed ordinary baryonic matter accounts for the rotation curve , but outside which , the distribution of the baryonic components can not justify the observed _ profiles _ and sometimes _ amplitudes _ of the measured circular velocities ( bosma 1981 , see also gentile et al .",
    "this is usually solved by adding an extra mass component , the dark matter ( dm ) halo .",
    "rotation curves ( rcs ) have been used to assess the existence , the amount and the distribution of this dark component .",
    "recent debate in the literature has focused on the `` cuspiness '' of the dark matter density profile in the centers of galaxy halos that emerges in cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations of structure formation ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 , nfw hereafter ; moore et al . , 1999 ; navarro et al . , 2004 ; neto et al . 2007 ) but is not seen in observed data ( e.g. de blok , mcgaugh & rubin , 2001 ; de blok & bosma , 2002 ; marchesini et al . , 2002 ; gentile et al . , 2004 , 2005 , 2007a ) , as well as on the various systematics of the dm distribution",
    "( see salucci et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "an intriguing general property of dark matter haloes was noted by kormendy & freeman ( 2004 , proceedings of iau meeting ) , based on halo parameters obtained by mass modelling 55 spiral galaxy rotation curves within the framework of the maximum disk hypothesis ( mdh ) , whose validity has been much debated ( bosma 2004 , palunas and williams 2000 , salucci and persic 1999 ) . among other relations between the halo parameters , they found that the quantity @xmath9 , proportional to the halo central surface density for any cored halo distributions , is nearly independent of the galaxy blue magnitude . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath1 are , respectively , the central density and core radius of the adopted pseudo - isothermal cored dark matter density profile @xmath10 . in particular , they found that this quantity takes a value of @xmath11 .",
    "the kormendy and freeman analysis relies on the mdh , which fixes the value of the disk mass at its maximum compatible with the observed rotation curve , under the reasonable hypothesis that mass follows light in the disk and that the halo is not hollow . from the value of the disk mass rc fitting yield the values of the two structural dm parameters ( i.e. @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) . as matter of fact",
    ", mdh allows to _ uniquely _ decompose the rcs - also those that , in term of extension , spatial resolution , r.m.s errors , non - axisymmetric motions , can not be _ successfully _ analyzed by @xmath12 method assuming mass models with also the disk mass as a free parameter .",
    "the mdh , on the other hand , may strongly bias the determination of the halo properties in the case in which stars do not dominate the inner parts of a galaxy .    more recently , spano et al . ( 2008 ) @xmath12 fitted the rcs of 36 spiral galaxies by using a mass model with a stellar disk and a cored dark sphere of density @xmath13 the r - band surface brightness , via the assumption of a constant mass - to - light ratio for the stellar component , provided the _ profile _ of the stellar contribution to the circular velocity .",
    "they showed that @xmath14 or @xmath15 , consistent with the findings of kormendy & freeman ( 2004 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the @xmath8 vs magnitude relationship for objects whose central densities and core radii vary by several orders of magnitude .",
    "we aim to investigate the above galaxy relationship by applying a number of unbiased techniques of dm decomposition to new large samples of galaxies of different hubble type and magnitudes .",
    "given the wide - ranging nature of the data and of the mass modelling involved in the present investigation , there is very little likelihood of obtaining a false - positive result due to systematic errors and biases in the analysis or in the data .    -2.1truecm",
    "-1.1truecm    we will investigate : ( a ) a large sample of spiral galaxies , analyzed by @xmath12 fitting their universal rotation curve ( urc , pss ) ; ( b ) ngc3741 , the most dark matter dominated spiral in the local universe and ddo 47 , a very well studied dwarf spiral ( gentile et al .",

    "we therefore investigate eq .",
    "[ spano ] in a much wider range of hubble types and magnitudes and by exploiting a larger number of techniques than previous works .",
    "finally , we test the value of @xmath8 with the kinematics of six dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the milky way for which extensive stellar kinematic data sets are available .    in all cases",
    "a cored dark matter halo provides a very satisfactory fit to the observed data , generally superior to that obtained by assuming a nfw profile for the dm halo .",
    "the success of the simple stellar disk + burkert cored halo + hi disk model in accounting for the available kinematics ( both in absolute terms and with respect to different halo models ) is a strong support for the reliability of the derived halo structural parameters .",
    "it is not an aim of this paper to directly test the nfw halo profile , and we will exclusively work in the alternative framework of the cored halo profiles .    with the exception of the weak lensing analysis and of dsph galaxies , the mass models used in this paper have been obtained elsewhere , in papers to which we redirect the reader for further information .    in section  2 ,",

    "moreover , it leads to estimates of the disk mass in good agreement with the expectations from stellar population synthesis models ( e.g. salucci , yegorova & drory 2008 , gentile et al .",
    "2004 , spano et al .",
    "2008 , see also frigerio martins & salucci 2007 ) .",
    "the existence of a constant central surface density of dark matter in galaxies does not depend on which specific ( cored ) density profile it is assumed for the dark matter , i.e. whether we adopt any of the following : spano et al . ( 2008 ; labeled as s hereafter ) , donato et al .",
    "( 2004 ; d ) or the present one ( b ) .",
    "different _ cored _ mass models provide equally good fits to the same kinematical data sets ( e.g. gentile et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "all of them can describe the actual halo mass profile @xmath18 in the core region by tuning the values of the central density and of core radius .",
    "the relations @xmath19 must hold , thus providing us with the proportionality factors between the corresponding parameters ( core radius and central density ) of the different profiles . we find : @xmath20 .",
    "we use this small corrections to compare the values of @xmath8 relative to different halo profiles .",
    "of course , at outer radii  outside the core region and often outside the last measured point",
    " each cored model has a different well distinct velocity behavior .",
    "one of the advantages of the adopted burkert halo profile is that , at small radii and for appropriate values of the parameter @xmath1 , it can reproduce the nfw velocity profiles to which , in any case , it converges for @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , with the adopted profile , the rc data themselves discriminate , by determining the value of the best fit parameter @xmath1 , the actual level of cuspiness of the halo .",
    "donato et al . ( 2004 ) analyzed the mass profiles of 25 spiral and lsb galaxies obtained by @xmath22 modelling their rcs .",
    "the successful models had cored dark matter halo profiles whose core radii correlated strongly with the exponential disk scale length @xmath23 of their stellar distributions . in figure  1",
    "we plot @xmath8 as a function of @xmath23 for the donato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample .",
    "we see that the derived values for @xmath8 are almost constant , although @xmath23 varies by more than one order of magnitude , consistently with the findings of spano et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and kormendy & freeman ( 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , there is no obvious difference between the results from high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies . while this result is in good agreement with eq .",
    "[ spano ] , it is important to note that the two samples are similar , with five objects in common , and the analysis employed is essentially the same .    before adding new crucial evidences for a relationship like eq .",
    "[ spano ] , we would like to stress again that this will come from mass modelling techniques that are unbiased towards any particular dm profile , and unable to artificially create spurious relationship between the dm mass parameters .",
    "it is useful to recall the evidence from which we start ( see figure 2 ) : the relation found by spano et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for 36 spirals and the above @xmath24 vs @xmath23 relationship for the 25 spirals of the donato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample , both in qualitative agreement with kormendy & freeman ( 2004 ) .",
    "we now calculate the central surface density @xmath8 for the family of spirals by means of their universal rotation curve ( urc ) ( persic , salucci & stel , 1996 , pss hereafter ) .",
    "this curve , _ on average _ , reproduces well the rcs of late type ( sb - im ) spirals out to their virial radii @xmath25 ( pss ; salucci et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the urc is built from ( a ) the co - added kinematical data of a large number of spirals ( pss ; see also catinella et al . ,",
    "2006 ) and ( b ) the disk mass versus halo virial mass relationship of shankar et al .",
    "by @xmath12 fitting the urc with a burkert halo + a freeman disk velocity model , with no assumptions on the amount of baryonic matter , we obtain @xmath2 and @xmath26 as the best - fit values ( see equations 6a , 7 and 10 of salucci et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath8 values are plotted vs. @xmath27 as a solid line in figure  2 .",
    "the urc , derived from co - added rotation curves of objects with the same luminosity , traces their ensemble - averaged gravitational potential .",
    "this is extremely useful : the consequent mass model is free from the particularities ( internal r.m.s .",
    ", non - axisymmetric motions , observational errors ) that affect , at different levels , almost every _ individual _ rotation curve and the ensuing mass model ; this particularities , in fact , get averaged out in the urc construction .    on the other hand , for the task of determining the dm structure parameters , the coadded rcs are not sufficient in that , at a fixed luminosity , there could be a cosmic variance around `` the average galaxy '' .",
    "then , in order to assess the universality of eq .",
    "[ spano ] , we will investigate the dm mass structure in individual objects supplementing new observational data to those of kormendy and freeman 2004 , spano et al . and of donato et al .",
    ".    de blok et al .",
    "( 2008 ) measured high - resolution rotation curves for a sample of late spirals belonging to things ( the hi nearby galaxy survey ) .",
    "we select from this sample the objects in which the mass modelling yields reliable estimates of the dark matter structural parameters .",
    "we have rejected objects in which a ) the kinematics is clearly affected by non - circular motions , b ) the stellar mass component strongly dominates the galaxy potential out to the last measured point , preventing us from determining the properties of the underlying dark matter halo , or c ) very different models are found to equally fit the rc . with these selection criteria , we rejected 6 galaxies out of 17 .",
    "this selection , though mandatory to successfully probe the dm potential ( e.g. lake & feinswog 1989 ) , limits the investigation of the dm distribution of galaxies by means of their kinematics and photometry .",
    "for instance we can use only objects in which a ) _ neatly both _",
    "dark component and the stellar components _ of known distribution _ affect ( at different radii ) the available kinematics b ) non - circular motions are modest .",
    "the rotation curves in the blok el al.s things sample were modelled with a spherical pseudo - isothermal dark halo plus an hi disk and a stellar disk whose free mass parameters are obtained by @xmath12 fits .",
    "in addition to the standard method in which the stellar mass - to - light ratio is a free parameter , they also modelled their rc s by assuming for the latter quantity the values obtained from the galaxy colors as predicted by spectro - photometric models with a 1 ) diet - salpeter or a 2 ) kroupa imf . for each object",
    "we take their results in the following way : we average the value of @xmath28 obtained by the latter two methods , and then we average the result with the value obtained by the un - constrained mass model .",
    "notice that we take also the values of @xmath28 coming from the spectro - photometric method of mass modelling , although the latter may be less accurate than the @xmath12 one ( e.g. salucci et al .",
    "2008 ) because we want an independent check on the mass modelling procedure . in any case , the values obtained by @xmath12 fits are within the shown errorbars .",
    "we found that the galaxies ddo 154 , n 925 , n 2366 , n 2403 , i 2574 , n 2976 , n 3198 , n 3621 ,",
    "n 5055 , n 6946 , n 7331 satisfy the above discussed selection criteria .",
    "the resulting mass models well reproduces the rcs and the relative halo parameters are derived within a reasonable uncertainty ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath8 are plotted in figure ( 2 ) .",
    "we extend the relationship down to the lowest luminosities of disk systems by means of the nearby dwarf galaxy ngc 3741 ( @xmath30 ) : it represents the very numerous dwarf disk objects which are dark matter dominated down to one disk length - scale or less , and in which the hi gaseous disk is the main baryonic component .",
    "in addition , this galaxy has an extremely extended hi disk , which allowed gentile et al .",
    "( 2007b ) to carefully trace the rc and therefore its gravitational potential out to unprecedented distances , relative to the extent of the optical disk .",
    "the data probe out of 7 kpc ( equivalent to 42 b - band exponential scale lengths ) with several independent measures within the estimated halo core radius . by standard @xmath12",
    "fitting , the rc was decomposed into its stellar , gaseous and dark ( burkert halo ) components .",
    "the resulting best fit mass model very well reproduces the observed rc ( gentile et al . , 2007b ) : the corresponding @xmath8 is plotted in fig .",
    "2 as a filled green circle .",
    "this result is seconded by ddo 47 , another faint dwarf spiral .",
    "gentile et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have mass modelled its rc in the same way as described above .",
    "we plot the relevant quantities in fig . 2 as another filled green circle , at @xmath31 .",
    "the relatively large error - bars of both estimates is due to uncertainties in the distance , that affects any nearby object , and not by the mass model itself , which is virtually free from the uncertainties in the estimate of the mass of the stellar disk ( which for these object is negligible ) .",
    "it is worth to notice that burkert ( 1995 ) , in his pioneering study on the dm structure in galaxies , for an handful of dwarfs with absolute blue magnitudes ranging between -14.5 and -17.0 and modelling their low spatial resolution hi rcs , found values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 that lead , in these objects , to @xmath32 in agreement with our results .    to investigate the opposite end of hubble spiral sequence , i.e. the sa galaxies , disk systems embedded in a relevant spheroidal stellar component , we resort to the mass models that have become recently available ( noordermeer 2006 , noordermeer et al .",
    "2007 ) . from this sample , using to the selection criteria discussed above , we take the following galaxies : n 2487 , n 2916 , n 2953 , n 3546 , ugc 8699 , ugc 11852 .",
    "we reject 11 galaxies out of 17 .",
    "notice that , only for a small fraction of the rejected objects in the things and noordermeer sample the failure of the mass modelling is due to poor kinematics . in most of the cases ,",
    "it originates from the presence of a strong inner dominance on the galaxy dynamics of _ two _ baryonic components ( the disk and the bulge ) , and it may reflect an intrinsically complex inner mass distribution . on the other hand , systems with a multi - component strong central baryonic mass concentration likely underwent secular physical processes that may have affected the original distribution of the dark matter halo ( heller et al .",
    "2007 , athanassoula , 2008 ) making them complex systems that must be investigated more accurately by future studies .",
    "the mass models are based on rc @xmath12 decompositions that include a stellar bulge , a stellar disk , a neutral gas disk and a pseudo - isothermal ( cored ) dark matter halo .",
    "the resulting @xmath8 are plotted in fig .",
    "we now derive the galaxy mass distribution by measuring their gravitational potential in a different way from that employed so far .",
    "this will test both the observational data and the fundamental assumptions underlying the results shown above . from the galaxy - galaxy weak - lensing signals of a large sample of spiral and elliptical galaxies , we determine their dm distribution .",
    "the basic data is the azimuthally - averaged tangential shear @xmath33 recently measured for a sample containing about @xmath34 isolated objects split into 5 luminosity bins ( hoekstra et al .",
    "2005 ) , as a function of the galactocentric radius .",
    "the sample spans a good luminosity range of spirals , while the most luminous bin is likely dominated by the biggest ellipticals in the local universe .",
    "data extend from @xmath35 = 70 kpc out to @xmath36 = 560 kpc from the center of the lenses . in this radial range ,",
    "the galaxy stellar component ( a freeman disk for spirals , a sersic spheroid for ellipticals ) contributes negligibly to the shear : the spheroid half- light radius does not reach @xmath37 kpc a distance @xmath38 .",
    "the mass model , therefore , includes only a ( burkert ) dark halo .",
    "notice , however , that , while we need kinematical data at radii well inside @xmath1 to detect in a rc a burkert core ( of size @xmath1 ) , in the tangential shear , instead , the effect of a burkert profile extends further out , up to @xmath39 , i.e. for the most luminous objects , it extends out to @xmath40 .",
    "the present weak lensing data are ( marginally ) able to to measure the values of @xmath2 and @xmath1",
    ". formally these are obtained by @xmath41 modeling @xmath42 with a burkert mass profile .",
    "the details are presented in appendix a and the resulting @xmath8 are plotted in fig .",
    "2 ( as solid squares ) .",
    "thus , we applied the same technique to the same kind of data both for spirals ( all luminosity bins but the last ) and for ellipticals ( the last bin ) .",
    "we found no difference in the dm profile systematics and in particular in the value of @xmath43 .",
    "then , from our collection of values , at the level of 0.2 dex , no substantial differences emerge between the values of @xmath8 estimated from different types of data or between spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "it thus appears that the central surface density of dm halos assumes a nearly constant value with respect to galaxy luminosity , over a range of at least nine magnitudes .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we compare our results with those of spano et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "we plot their data in figure 2 .",
    "let us remark that their data are not included in our present sample : indeed , because we want to raise our claim in an independent way from their work , and their data are used as a consistency check .",
    "however , we remove two objects with an enormous uncertainty ( i.e. @xmath44 than a factor 10 ) on the best fit value of one of the two parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( private communication , ugc 3876 and ugc 4456 ) .      this result can be extended to lower magnitudes by means of the milky way satellite dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies , the smallest and most dark matter dominated systems known in the universe ( see e.g. mateo , 1998 ; gilmore et al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "their low hi gas content is another property that sets them apart as a galaxy class ( e.g. grebel , gallagher & harbeck , 2003 ) . in a recent study of six dsphs gilmore et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed by @xmath12 techniques that , assuming spherical symmetry and velocity isotropy , the stellar kinematics and photometry of dsphs are consistent with their occupying cored dm haloes .",
    "our current lack of knowledge about the anisotropy of the stellar velocity distribution , make their density profiles not uniquely constrained by the data .",
    "cusped models can also reproduce the dispersion velocity data in most dsphs ( gilmore et al .",
    "2007 ; koch et al . 2007 ; battaglia et al . 2008 ) , modulus an appropriate run with radius of the anisotropy parameter . bearing this caveat in mind",

    "the observed stellar density @xmath45 distribution is well represented by a plummer sphere : @xmath46 with @xmath47 the half light radius .",
    "this stellar spheroid is tracer of but a negligible source for the gravitational potential : its mass is only @xmath48 times the dark mass inside @xmath47 ( gilmore et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the full mass modelling of these objects are given in salucci et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . here",
    "we compute the relevant structural parameters with a simplified approach .",
    "we realize that the 1-d stellar velocity dispersion @xmath49 are radially very slowly varying and we assume , for the purpose of this work , that is constant : @xmath50 . therefore , within the above assumptions , from the jeans equation the halo mass can be computed by : @xmath51 that leads to @xmath52 with the values of @xmath53 and @xmath47 given in gilmore et al .",

    "such variations are nevertheless fine - tuned so that the product @xmath28 remains almost constant , despite the strong discontinuity of the two separate quantities ( and of any other galaxy property ) .",
    "finally the `` well noted curiosity '' that all dsph halos contain roughly equal masses interior to about 0.3 - 1.0kpc ( mateo _ et al .",

    "the mass modeling of such objects has been carried out by using different and independent techniques , none of them capable to bias the resulting dm distribution towards an artificial relationship .",

    "furthermore , given the large range of the values of @xmath2 and @xmath83 in galaxies , eq ( 4 ) can not make any claim beyond to confirm a general trend between the two structural halo quantities , with @xmath84 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath83 must be worked out separately from the study of eq .",
    "[ we_find ] , from a properly selected observational data and with suitably performing methods of mass modelling .",
    "it is remarkable that the constancy of @xmath8 can be related to well - known scaling laws of spirals .",
    "let us define @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the enclosed halo mass inside @xmath1 and the halo circular velocity at @xmath1 . since for a burkert halo @xmath87 , then eq ( 4 ) implies @xmath88 which immediately reminds a sort of tully - fisher relation ( e.g. freeman , 2004 , mcgaugh 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , we can estimate the ratio between the contribution to the circular velocity from the disk and the dark halo at @xmath1 . from @xmath89",
    "one has , for a burkert halo : @xmath90 . by means of the relationship in eq(3 ) of tonini",
    "( 2006 ) that relates in spirals @xmath23 with @xmath91 and from the relation @xmath92 ( donato et al .",
    "2004 ) , one can compute the disk contribution @xmath1 : @xmath93 . from these dependencies",
    "we get that the velocity contributions fraction is proportional to @xmath94 , in good agreement with a main scaling law of spirals ( persic and salucci , 1988 , pss ) .",
    "the constancy of @xmath8 seems therefore related to the fact that less luminous objects have , in proportion , more dark matter .    considering that dm haloes are ( almost ) spherical systems",
    "it is surprising that their central surface density plays a role in galaxy structure .",
    "one could wonder whether the physics we witness in @xmath8 is instead stored separately in the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this reasonable interpretation has however a problem : @xmath1 and @xmath2 do correlate with the luminous counterparts ( the disk length - scale and stellar central surface density ) while @xmath8 does not .",
    "the evidence that the dm halo central surface density @xmath28 remains constant to within less than a factor of two over at least nine ( and possibly up to fourteen ) galaxy magnitudes , and across several hubble types ( we note , however , that for early - type spirals we have limited information ) , obviously indicates that this quantity may hide an important physical meaning in the dm distribution of galaxies .",
    "presently this finding is surprising , as it is difficult to envisage how such a relation can be achieved across galaxies which range from dark - matter - dominated to baryon - dominated in the inner regions .",
    "in addition , these galaxies have experienced significantly different evolutionary histories ( e.g. numbers of mergers , significance of baryon cooling , stellar feedback , etc . ) .",
    "finally , let us spend a few words of caution about the result we claim in this paper .",
    "further investigation is still needed before that we can correctly frame it in a cosmological context .",
    "in fact , although the number of objects for which a reliable dm mass distribution has been obtained is impressive , it is still quite limited with respect to the cosmic variance of present day galaxies .",
    "moreover , some types of objects such as those with distorted kinematics or those in which a bi - component stellar distribution has a strong central concentration , still escape a satisfactory analysis .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     recent developments in weak gravitational lensing have made it possible to probe the ensemble - averaged mass distribution around galaxies out to large projected distances providing crucial information , complementary to that obtained from kinematics .",
    "the tidal gravitational field of the dm halos generates weak - lensing signals , by introducing small coherent distortions in the images of distant background galaxies , which can be detected in current large imaging surveys .",
    "we can measure , from the centre of the lenses out to large distances ( much greater than the distances probed by the kinematic measurements ) , the azimuthally - averaged tangential shear @xmath95 @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the projected mass density of the object distorting the galaxy image , at projected radius @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the mean projected mass density interior to the radius @xmath98 . the critical density @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the distances from the observer to the source and lens , respectively , and @xmath104 is the source - lens distance . the above relations directly relate observed signals with the underlying dm halo density . for our analysis",

    "the sample , which contains about @xmath34 isolated objects and spans the whole luminosity range of spirals , is split into 5 luminosity bins whose b magnitudes ( taken from their table 1 ) are given in table  [ tab : weak_lensing ] . by adopting a density profile , we model @xmath95 ( see figure  [ fig : weak_lensing ] ) and obtain the structural parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 by means of standard best - fitting techniques .",
    "the burkert profile given by equation  [ burkert ] provides an excellent fit to the tangential shear ( see figure  [ fig : weak_lensing ] and table  [ tab : weak_lensing ] ) .",
    "although testing the nfw density profile is not an aim of this paper , let us notice that it provides a fit marginally sufficient for the shear data , but less satisfactory than the burkert profile especially around the most luminous objects ( @xmath106 ) ( figure  [ fig : weak_lensing ] ; see also figure  6 of hoekstra et al .",
    "2005 ) we found @xmath107 where we found a reduced @xmath12 of 2 .",
    "the region mapped by weak lensing is much more extended with respect to that probed by internal kinematics ; it is therefore not surprising that a nfw halo does not show the same variance with observations found at smaller radii in that the densities of actual dm halos around galaxies seem to converge , for @xmath108 to nfw profile ( see salucci et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "notice that at low luminosities ( @xmath109 ) the signal - to - noise is too low to discriminate between mass models , so , differently from the other estimates in this paper , in these cases we can not prove a - posteriori that the burkert profile is superior over the cuspy one ."
