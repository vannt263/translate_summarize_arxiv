    "high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) , one of the most interesting nonlinear phenomena occurring when atoms or molecules are exposed to an intense infrared laser field , has been widely used for the production of attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) @xcite . due to its great potential for probing ultrafast electronic processes ,",
    "different methods have been used to generate isolated attosecond pulses ( iaps ) . using carrier - envelope - phase ( cep ) stabilized few - cycle laser pulses , an iap as short as 80 attoseconds has been generated by synthesizing harmonics beyond the cutoff @xcite . starting with an elliptically polarized light , the polarization gating technique in which hhg emission from the central cycle of the pulse is selected , has also produced an isolated 130-as pulse @xcite . in a tight focusing geometry , using the so - called spatiotemporal gating , an iap can be generated since different phase - matching conditions can be achieved for different ranges of harmonics @xcite .",
    "other alternative methods of iap generation have been reported , including confining harmonics generated in a narrow temporal window in the leading edge of a laser pulse , where a 210-as iap has been reported @xcite .",
    "the iap can also be generated by optimizing the pressure and length of the gas cell @xcite or using a spatial filter in the far field @xcite .",
    "indeed there is a plethora of techniques for the production of the iap , with the idea that harmonics be generated from half an optical cycle only in a few- or multi - cycle infrared laser pulse .    since the harmonic field generated by all atoms or molecules within",
    "the laser focus co - propagates with the fundamental laser field in the medium , as well as possible further propagation in the free space depending on the experimental setup , the understanding of the observed hhg consists of two parts : first , the hhg emission from individual atoms ( or molecules ) through the laser - induced dipole ; second , the propagation of the fundamental and the harmonic fields in the medium and free space .",
    "there are two fundamental equations to be solved : time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for the single - atom ( or single - molecule ) response , and maxwell s wave equation for the propagation process . in practice , in the first step ,",
    "the solution of tdse is normally not employed due to computational difficulties . instead , strong - field approximation ( sfa ) ( or lewenstein model ) @xcite is used .",
    "however , it is well - known that sfa fails to reproduce the observed hhg spectra and thus the reliability of the predicted spectra after propagation in the medium is questionable . in recent years , a quantitative rescattering ( qrs ) theory has been proposed by our group @xcite , which has been corroborated subsequently by others @xcite .",
    "the single - atom ( or single - molecule ) response obtained from qrs has been shown to be as accurate as the one from tdse , but the calculation is as easy as sfa . taking advantage of this theoretical success ,",
    "recently we have incorporated the qrs theory into the macroscopic propagation of harmonic fields in the medium . until now",
    ", we have shown that qrs - based macroscopic harmonic spectra : ( i ) agreed well with tdse - based hhg spectra for ar @xcite ; ( ii ) compared well with experimental hhg spectra reported for ar , n@xmath0 , and co@xmath0 @xcite when the experimental conditions are well specified .",
    "it has been demonstrated that this approach can be used to calculate macroscopic hhg spectra by polyatomic molecules @xcite even though the predictions have not been tested against experiments yet . outside of our group ,",
    "the qrs theory has been applied to study hhg by the two - color fields in which the propagation effect is included @xcite .",
    "these applications of the qrs theory are focused on the hhg spectra . in this paper , we focus on the analysis of attosecond pulse generation which inevitably tests the phases of the harmonics obtained in our simulation .",
    "recently , xe has become a favorite candidate for generating an intense iap @xcite , studying phase - matching effects in the generation of high - energy photons @xcite , and probing the multi - electron dynamics with high - harmonic spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the generation of a high - energy 160-as iap using low - order harmonics of xe from a cep - stabilized laser .",
    "they used very high laser intensity and very dilute gas so that the fundamental field was not severely distorted , but the ground state of atom was depleted very quickly in the leading edge of the laser pulse .",
    "only low - order harmonics emitted within one half cycle were used to obtain an iap .",
    "@xcite used a 1.8-@xmath1 m laser with a duration of less than two optical cycles to obtain the hhg spectra of xe up to the photon energy of 160 ev .",
    "they have shown that hhg spectra exhibited strong enhancement above about 90 ev .",
    "this enhancement is well - known in photoionization ( pi ) of xe due to the presence of a strong shape resonance from the 4d shell which , through the channel coupling , modifies the partial pi cross section of the 5p shell of xe  a feature attributed to many - electron effects . according to qrs ,",
    "such enhancement is anticipated since partial photorecombination ( pr ) cross section ( related to photoionization ) enters directly in the laser - induced dipole . to simulate hhg spectra at high - photon energies , multi - electron effects on the laser - induced dipoles thus have to be included .",
    "using such dipoles in the qrs , we simulate the hhg spectra of xe generated by 1.8-@xmath1 m lasers by including the macroscopic propagation effects .    in this paper , as a check , we simulate the hhg spectra reported in shiner _",
    ". mostly we aim at reproducing the hhg spectra of xe observed experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite , which show nearly continuous photon energy distributions ( to be called continuum structure ) at high laser intensities .",
    "such continuum spectra have also been observed in molecules , like no @xcite . from our simulation , we wish to demonstrate whether iaps are generated by these harmonics .",
    "for this , we demonstrate how to select different ranges of harmonics to synthesize an iap by using a spatial filter in the far field .",
    "this approach is different from that in ferrari _",
    "@xcite , but similar to the analysis in gaarde _",

    "ii , we briefly summarize the propagation equations , wavelet theory for the time - frequency analysis , formulas for the attosecond pulse generation , and qrs theory including multi - electron effects . in sec .",
    "iii , the theoretical results are presented and analyzed for different experimental conditions , for iaps by synthesizing harmonic orders from 40 to 80 ( h40-h80 ) and h90-h130 .",
    "we also compare attosecond pulses calculated using the qrs and the sfa .",

    "the fundamental laser field is assumed to be gaussian both in space and time at the entrance of the medium , and the gas pressure is constant within the medium .",
    "the 3d propagation equation of the harmonic field is @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the polarization depending on the applied fundamental field @xmath3 . here",
    "the free - electron dispersion is neglected because the frequencies of high harmonics are much higher than the plasma frequency . in general , the polarization @xmath21 is separated into linear and nonlinear components , and the linear susceptibility @xmath22 includes both linear dispersion and absorption effects of the harmonics @xcite .",

    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ fund - time ] ) and ( [ harm - time ] ) are solved using the crank - nicholson routine in the frequency domain .",
    "once the harmonic field at the exit face ( near field ) of the medium is computed , the harmonics propagating in free space in the far field can be obtained from near - field harmonics through a hankel transformation @xcite .",
    "a time - frequency representation ( tfr ) ( or spectrogram ) of the harmonic field @xmath27 is a simultaneous representation of the temporal and spectral characteristics of the harmonics .",

    "the absolute value of @xmath32 depends on @xmath31 , but the general temporal pattern does not change much . in this paper , we choose @xmath33 to perform the wavelet transform .",
    "harmonics emitted at the exit plane ( near field ) of the medium act as a source for the far - field harmonics . in order to avoid the complexity of the harmonic spatial distribution in the near field ( see fig . 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we calculate @xmath32 for each radial point in the near field and then integrate over the radial coordinate @xcite : @xmath34 to demonstrate the divergence of harmonics , we preform the tfr for each radial point in the far field .",
    "the spectral filter used to select a range of harmonics ( @xmath35 - @xmath36 ) could affect the generation of attosecond pulse trains ( apts ) or iaps .",
    "theoretically we can obtain the total intensity of an apt or an iap in the near field as following @xcite : @xmath37 in the far field , a spatial filter is used to select the harmonics in a prescribed area . in this paper , we assume that the filter is circular with a radius @xmath38 , and is perpendicular to the propagation direction of harmonics .",
    "the intensity of an apt or an iap in the far field is @xmath39      the single - atom induced dipole moment @xmath40 in eq .",

    "when the multi - electron effect is not important , the transition dipole can be calculated using the single - active electron ( sae ) approximation . however , the transition dipole is easily generalized to include many - electron effects , as routinely done in pi theory of atoms and molecules .",
    "thus to include many - electron effects in @xmath42 , multi - channel calculations such as many - body perturbation theory , close - coupling method , r - matrix method , random - phase approximation , and many others can all be employed for such purpose .",
    "since pi of xe has been well studied , we obtain @xmath42 semi - empirically .",
    "the major many - body effect for pi of xe from 5p shell occurs at photon energy where 4d shell is open . thus below about 60 ev , the transition dipole from 5p",
    "can be obtained from a single - electron model .",
    "this gives the magnitude and phase of the transition dipole . at higher energies ,",
    "effects from the 4d shell on the transition dipole of 5p becomes important since pi cross section of xe from 4d has a large and broad shape resonance around 100 ev .",
    "the intershell coupling will enhance the @xmath42 for 5p near and above 90 ev .",

    ", the phase of @xmath42 is taken from the 5p shell under the sae approximation @xcite while the magnitude is taken from ref .",
    "this approximation does not change the temporal structure of attosecond pulses ( shown later ) since the phase of @xmath44 is dominated by the phase of the wave packet @xmath43 .",
    "we comment that in qrs the induced dipole is given in the energy domain , thus the calculation is similar to the time independent theory used in pi which has been well - established in the last 30 years .",

    "in fact , this portion of the pulse does not have good periodic time dependence .",
    "[ fig5](b ) also shows that only the pulse emitted at t=-1 ( in units of optical cycles ) is near the axis , thus a filter selecting near axis harmonics results in an iap , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) .",
    "the iap has a duration of 260 as . for pulses synthesized from h90-h130 , fig .",
    "[ fig5](d ) shows that there are two bursts emitted at t=-0.5 and 0 , and their lateral profiles in the far field are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](e ) . by using a filter , an attosecond pulse of 150 as can be obtained . in this case , the iap intensity does not increase since the fundamental laser field is much reshaped and the harmonic has a much bigger divergence in the far field in comparison with 1.0@xmath4610@xmath47 w/@xmath48 .",
    "it is concluded that ionization gating still works at a higher laser intensity , and it is more efficient to select bursts that are born in the leading edge before the laser field starts to be depleted and blue shifted .",
    "another question arises is whether the strength of attosecond pulses can be improved by increasing gas pressure . for  weak \" fields and low pressure , shiner _",
    "_ @xcite have shown experimentally that the harmonic yield increases quadratically with the pressure .",
    "for  high \" fields addressed here , laser pulse reshaping is important , we have confirmed theoretically that increasing the gas pressure while maintaining the same intensity would not always increase the harmonic yields of ar @xcite . on the other hand , the pressure effect on the high harmonics of xe at  high \" field has been studied in ref .",
    "but its effect on the attosecond pulse was nt examined in this paper .",
    "the position of the spatial filter in the far field can be easily adjusted in an experiment .",
    "here we show the change of attosecond pulses with the far - field position . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , attosecond pulses synthesized ( h40-h80 ) at two other positions z=100 mm and 900 mm are given .",
    "this is to be compared with the ones at z=455 mm in figs .",
    "[ fig4](e ) and ( f ) . using the same filter ( indicated by the solid line in red for fixed r@xmath71=100 @xmath1 m ) ,",
    "the attosecond pulses generated are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "the width of the main burst does not change much with z , but the strength of the satellite peak is reduced . of course this",
    "is achieved at the expense of decreasing the strength of the attosecond pulse .",
    "this has also been shown by gaarde and schafer @xcite where an iap was selected by moving the reflecting mirror further from the laser focus .      in the last two decades",
    ", the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) , which is in the frame of the sae approximation , has been widely used to predict the temporal structure of attosecond pulses even though sfa is unable to explain the observed harmonic spectra precisely in general . in the present calculation",
    ", we use qrs in the propagation calculation . for single - atom response",
    ", qrs has been tested against tdse , both for the magnitude and phase , as documented in le _",
    "@xcite , for example . in qrs",
    ", the wave packet is obtained from sfa , including the phase .",
    "the transition dipole @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ single - qrs ] ) , also introduces a phase . in sfa , this phase is a constant , either real or pure imaginary ( depending on the symmetry of the ground state ) and independent of the harmonic order . in qrs ,",
    "the transition dipole moment is a complex number in general .",
    "from pi theory , however , it is known that the phase of the transition dipole does not change much with the photon energy .",
    "thus the phases of the harmonics calculated from qrs and sfa do not differ significantly .",
    "since the phases of the harmonics are much more important in synthesizing attosecond pulses @xcite , this explains why propagation theory based on sfa has been so successful in explaining the generation of attosecond pulses , in spite of its failure in predicting or explaining the observed harmonic spectra . in this subsection",
    ", we support this analysis with actual results from simulations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) the hhg spectra of xe obtained from sfa ( within the sae approximation ) and qrs ( including multi - electron effects ) using the laser parameters given in the captions are shown .",
    "clearly the spectra differ greatly . in figs .",
    "[ fig7](b ) and ( c ) the synthesized ( h40-h80 ) attosecond pulses at the near field and the far field are shown .",
    "clearly the results from the two calculations are essentially identical ( after an overall normalization ) , in spite of the large differences in the harmonic spectra .",
    "we have checked some other cases and found that the temporal structures of the attosecond pulses from the two theories are always very similar .",
    "larger differences than those shown in figs .",
    "[ fig7](b ) and ( c ) are expected if a wider range of harmonics are used or if the spectra from the two theories differ much more , but the general conclusion is correct .",
    "the selection of an iap by a spatial filter in the far field discussed above is only for a single cep , and thus only useful if the laser is cep - stabilized ( has not been achieved for 1.8-@xmath1 m lasers yet ) . to check",
    "if the method can be used for lasers that are not cep - stabilized , we investigate the cep dependence of the iap generation .    in figs .",
    "[ fig8](a ) and ( b ) , we show the contrast ratio between the intensities of the strongest satellite and the strongest attosecond burst , and in figs .",
    "[ fig8](c ) and ( d ) , we show the peak intensity of the strongest attosecond burst , as the cep is varied , for the two laser intensities indicated .",
    "a good iap is to have high peak intensity for the main peak and weak satellites . from figs .",
    "[ fig8](c ) and ( d ) , we note that at the cep s where the strongest attosecond bursts have high peak values , the contrast ratios shown in figs .",
    "[ fig8](a ) and ( b ) at these cep s are always small . in the meanwhile ,",
    "when the contrast ratio is large , the strongest attosecond burst is always weak . thus it is possible to generate single attosecond pulses even when the cep of the driving laser is not stabilized",
    "this explains the success why the first single attosecond pulses were generated using few - cycle laser pulses that were not phase - stabilized @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the generation of isolated attosecond pulses ( iaps ) using few - cycle mid - infrared lasers at large intensities near and above the critical intensity of xe .",
    "the calculations are based on the qrs theory where many - electron effects are included in the single - atom induced dipole moment ; specifically , by including the coupling of the inner 4d shell of xe in the partial 5p photorecombination transition dipole matrix element .",
    "the effect of the medium on the fundamental and harmonic fields is obtained by solving the maxwell s wave equations .",
    "the modification ( or reshaping in space and time ) of the fundamental field is due to its nonlinear interaction with the medium includes dispersion , plasma effect , and kerr nonlinearity .",
    "we have investigated the spatiotemporal evolution of the fundamental laser field in detail , and found that its reshaping is responsible for the continuum structure in the hhg spectra .",
    "this conclusion is carried out in terms of the time - frequency analysis of harmonics in the near and far fields .    since the divergence of harmonic emission from different half cycles is varied due to the blue shift and defocusing of the fundamental laser pulse ( or complicated reshaping ) , we have shown that isolated attosecond pulses can be generated by synthesizing h40-h80 or h90-h130 , selected by a spatial filter centered on the propagation axis in the far field .",
    "the mechanism of iap generation in this paper could be called as  ionization gating \" .",
    "it works for a loosely focused laser at high laser intensity ( above the critical intensity ) , which is reshaped as it propagates through the medium with a moderate gas pressure .",
    "a similar approach has been discussed by gaarde _",
    "_ @xcite using a 750-nm laser interacting with 135-torr ne gas .",
    "we have found that it is easier to reshape the fundamental field using a long - wavelength laser with a moderate gas pressure ( @xmath49 30 torr ) .",
    "the extended harmonic cutoff of xe leads to a broad range of harmonics available for iap generation .",
    "this approach is also different from ferrari _",
    "@xcite where low harmonics ( @xmath49 30 ev , which is equivalent to h40 in this paper ) are used to generate the iap . in addition , we have discussed the possibilities of improving the intensity of the iap , such as changing far - field position , increasing laser intensity , and increasing gas pressure .",
