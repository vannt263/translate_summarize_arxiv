    "symmetries have traditionally been very useful in nuclear physics partly because the force at the hadronic level is not well known at short distances  @xcite . in some cases , like isospin , chiral or heavy quark symmetry , the invariance can directly be traced from the fundamental qcd lagrangean and formulated in terms of the underlying quark and gluonic degrees of freedom . in some other cases the connection is less straightforward .",
    "many years ago wigner and hund proposed  @xcite extending the spin and isospin @xmath3 symmetry into the larger @xmath4 group where the nucleon - spin states @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 correspond to the fundamental representation , and hence providing a supermultiplet structure of nuclear energy levels as well as new selection rules for nuclear transitions and response functions  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath4 mass formula was found to be at least as good as the well known weizscker one  @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit interaction of the shell model obviously violate the symmetry , and indeed a breakdown of @xmath4 has been reported for heavier nuclei  @xcite while nuclear matter has been addressed in  @xcite .",
    "double binding energy differences have been shown to be a useful test of the symmetry  @xcite .",
    "recently , inequalities for light nuclei based on @xmath4 and euclidean path integrals have been derived by neglecting all but s - wave interactions  @xcite .    despite its relative success along the years",
    ", @xmath4 symmetry has been treated as an accidental one within the traditional approach to nuclear physics and guessing its origin from qcd has been a subject of some interest in the last decade .",
    "indeed , attempts to justify @xmath4 spin - flavour symmetry from a more fundamental level have been carried out along several lines .",
    "based on the limit of large number of colors @xmath0 of qcd  @xcite , it was shown  @xcite that if the nucleon momentum scales as @xmath9 , the nuclear potentials scale either as @xmath0 or @xmath10 , depending upon the particular spin - isospin channel , which shows that the nn force could be determined with @xmath11 relative accuracy .",
    "it was found that the leading potential would be @xmath4 symmetric if the tensor force was neglected in addition , a plausible assumption for light nuclei where s - waves dominate .",
    "although these estimates are conducted directly in terms of quarks and gluons , quark - hadron duality allows to reformulate these results in terms of purely hadronic degrees of freedom , providing a rationale for the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) potential models  @xcite , and the internal consistency of two-  @xcite and multiple boson exchanges  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of sizes of volume integrals of phenomenologically successful potentials confirms the large @xmath0 expectations  @xcite .",
    "the large size of scattering lengths was regarded as a fingerprint of the @xmath4 symmetry within an effective field theory ( eft ) viewpoint  @xcite using the power divergent subtracted ( pds ) scheme ; singlet and triplet renormalized couplings coincide at the natural renormalization scale @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the scattering lengths , and a contact interaction makes sense in such a scaling regime .",
    "resonance saturation based on the elimination of exchanged mesons in the obe bonn potential  @xcite at very low energies was also shown to reproduce the eft approach and to agree numerically with the wigner symmetry expectations  @xcite . according to refs .",
    "@xcite qcd might be close to a point where the effective theory had an @xmath4 symmetry at zero energy as well as discrete scale invariance if the pion mass was larger than its physical value , around @xmath15 .",
    "this nice idea might be confirmed by recent fully dynamical lattice qcd determinations of the scattering lengths  @xcite and quenched lattice qcd evaluations of nn potentials  @xcite where indeed unphysical pion masses are probed .    while the proclaimed symmetry holds in a range where scale invariance sets in and eft methods based on contact interactions",
    "can be applied  @xcite , is not obvious _",
    "what _ are the implications for the lightest nn system itself for finite energies and for physical pion masses . in particular , the scale dependence of the contact interaction is modified when the finite range of the long distance potential is taken into account . to be specific ,",
    "low energy nn scattering is dominated by s - waves in different @xmath16 channels where spin and isospin are interchanged , @xmath17=@xmath18= @xmath2 .",
    "wigner @xmath4 symmetry predicts _ identical _ interactions in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels . the above mentioned identity of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 potentials holds also in the large @xmath0-expansion  @xcite ,",
    "so we take advantage of this fact by using the leading @xmath0-obe potentials which simplifies the discussion to a large extent as we discuss in sect .  [",
    "sec : obe ] .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding phase shifts from partial wave analyses  @xcite are _ very different _ at all energies . we are thus confronted with an intriguing puzzle since it is not obvious at all in what sense should the symmetry be interpreted for the nn system ; it would be difficult to understand otherwise the successes of @xmath4 for light nuclei .",
    "a second puzzle arises from an embarrasing cohabitation of conflicts and agreements between large-@xmath0 studies and wigner symmetry . despite the initial claim  @xcite a more complete analysis  @xcite could only justify the wigner symmetry in even - l partial waves while for odd - l a violation of the symmetry",
    "was expected . however , doing so required neglecting the tensor force , which according to the wigner symmetry should vanish , but it is a leading contribution to the potential in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "thus , while some pieces of the nn potential ( such as e.g. spin - orbit ) are suppressed in both schemes , some others are not simultaneously small .",
    "these conflicts between the time - honoured @xmath4 wigner symmetry and the qcd based large-@xmath0 expansion for odd - l channels require an explanation and naturally pose the question on the validity of either framework .    in the present work",
    "we analyze both puzzles by introducing the concept of a _ long distance symmetry _ firstly to understand the meaning of wigner symmetry in those cases where its validity complies with large @xmath0 expectations .",
    "this is a case where we expect the symmetry to be more robust .",
    "once this is done , it is pertinent to dilucidate the validity of the symmetry in those cases where a possible conflict with the large @xmath0 expansion arises .",
    "our discussion is tightly linked to the coordinate space renormalization discussed in previous works  @xcite .",
    "this approach while borrowing the physical motivation from eft theories provides a quantum mechanical framework where the emphasis is placed on the non - perturbative aspects of the nn problem , a playground where the standard eft viewpoint has encountered notorious difficulties .",
    "the method is reviewed in sect .",
    "[ sec : uni - renor ] for completeness .",
    "we find that for s - waves the wigner symmetry holds in a much wider range than the applicability of a contact interaction suggests if the finite range of the interaction is incorpored . as a byproduct we provide in sect .",
    "[ sec : numeric ] _ quantitative _ predictions ; the seemingly independent triplet and singlet s - waves phase shifts corresponding to iso - vector and iso - scalar states respectively for the np system are shown to be neatly intertwined in the entire elastic region .",
    "a similar correlation can also be established between the @xmath1 virtual state and the @xmath2 deuteron bound state .",
    "actually , we show how the symmetry may be visualized for large scattering lengths due to the onset of scale invariance .",
    "symmetry breaking due to inclusion of further counter - terms , tensor interaction and spin - orbit interaction are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : symm - break ] .",
    "we show how a sum rule for supermultiplet phase shifts splitting due to spin - orbit and tensor interactions is well fulfilled for non - central l - even waves , and strongly violated in l - odd waves where a serber - like symmetry holds instead . this pattern of @xmath4-symmetry breaking complies to the large @xmath0 expectations , a somewhat unexpected conclusion . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we provide our main conclusions and outlook for further work .",
    "our starting point is the field theoretical obe model of the nn interaction  @xcite which includes all mesons with masses below the nucleon mass , i.e. , @xmath19 , @xmath20@xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . for the purpose of discussing @xmath4 wigner symmetry within the obe framework ( see appendix  [ eq : su4 ] for a brief overview ) we will deal here with s - waves only , neglecting for the moment the s - d wave mixing stemming from the tensor force as required by wigner symmetry . our results of sect .",
    "[ sec : numeric ] and estimates in sect .",
    "[ sec : tensor ] will provide the _ a posteriori _ justification of this simplifying assumption .",

    "[ sec : non - central ] as @xmath4-breaking perturbations . for the s - waves the nn potential reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 and pauli principle requires @xmath27 .",

    "the large @xmath0 limit contains infinitely many multi - meson exchanges which decay exponentially with the sum of the exchanged meson masses",
    ". however , nn scattering in the elastic region below pion production threshold probes cm momenta @xmath36 mev .",
    "given the fact that @xmath37 we expect heavier meson scales to be irrelevant , an in particular @xmath38 and @xmath39 themselves , are expected to be at most marginally important   uncorrelated multiple pion exchanges at , i.e. background non - resonant contributions in @xmath40 or @xmath41 scattering .",
    "we expect them not to be dominant once @xmath42 , @xmath39 and @xmath38 are included . ]",
    ". note that , in any case , when @xmath43 the redundant combination @xmath44 appears , indicating a further source of cancellation between @xmath39 and @xmath38 in this channel .",
    "moreover , since the leading contributions to the potential are @xmath45 and the subleading ones are @xmath46 , the neglected terms are of relative @xmath11 order , so we might expect an _ a priori _ @xmath47 , accuracy .    the coincidence between @xmath1 and @xmath2 potentials complies to the wigner @xmath4 symmetry which we review for completeness in appendix  [ eq : su4 ] for the two - nucleon system .",
    "modern high quality potentials  @xcite describing accurately nn scattering below pion production threshold show some traces of the symmetry for distances above @xmath48 .",
    "quenched lattice qcd evaluations of nn potentials for @xmath49  @xcite yield also similar @xmath1 and @xmath2 potentials for @xmath50 .",
    "thus , at first sight one may conclude that wigner symmetry holds when ope dominates , and thus has a limited range of applicability .",
    "an important result of the present investigation , which will be elaborated along the paper , is that this is not necessarily so , provided the relevant scales of symmetry breaking are properly isolated with the help of renormalization ideas .",
    "let us analyze the consequences of the symmetry , eq .",

    "the scattering phase - shift @xmath51 is computed by solving the ( s - wave ) schrdinger equation in r - space @xmath52 with a regular boundary condition at the origin @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , for a short range potential such as the one in eq .",
    "one also has the effective range expansion ( ere ) @xmath54 where the _ scattering length _",
    ", @xmath55 , is defined by the asymptotic behavior of the zero energy wave function as @xmath56 and the effective range , @xmath57 , is given by @xmath58 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : r0_singlet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the usual approach  @xcite everything is obtained from the potential assumed to be valid for @xmath59 .",
    "we note incidentally that the wigner symmetry relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot ] ) , holds at _ all _ distances  .",
    "in addition , due to the _ unnaturally large _",
    "nn @xmath1 scattering length ( @xmath60 ) , any change in the potential @xmath61 has a dramatic effect on @xmath55 , since one obtains @xmath62 and thus the potential parameters _ must be fine tuned _ , and in particular the short distance physics . as it was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite this short distance sensitivity is unnatural as long as the obe potential does not truely represent a fundamental nn force at short distances .",
    "indeed , the sensitivity manifests itself as tight constraints for the potential parameters when the @xmath1 phase shift is fitted resulting in incompatible values of the coupling constants as obtained from other sources as nn scattering .",
    "of course , there is nothing wrong in the need of a fine tuning as this is a unavoidable consequence of the large scattering length ; the relevant point is whether this should be driven by a potential which will not be realistic at short distances .    in any case , in the traditional approach to nn potentials we are confronted with a paradox ; on the one hand the symmetry seems to suggest that _ somewhere _ the phase shifts should coincide , while on the other hand a fine tuning is required because of the large scattering lengths . in the standard approach , if @xmath63 then @xmath64 and thus @xmath65 , as one naturally expects .",
    "a straightforward explanation , of course , is to admit that the symmetry is strongly violated .",
    "this would make difficult to understand how can @xmath4 work at all for light nuclei if the simpler two nucleon system does not show manifestly the symmetry .    before presenting our solution to this dilemma in the next section ,",
    "let us note that a good condition for an approximate symmetry is that it be stable under symmetry breaking , otherwise a tiny perturbation @xmath66 would yield a large change , and this is precisely the bizarre situation we are bound to evolve because of the large scattering lengths .",
    "this suggests a clue to the problem , namely we should provide a framework where the highly potential - sensitive scattering length becomes a variable independent of the potential .",
    "more generally , we want to avoid the logical conclusion that a symmetry of the potential is a symmetry of the s - matrix  .",
    "as we will explain below the puzzle may be overcome by the concept of long distance symmetry ; a symmetry which is only broken at short distances by a suitable boundary condition .",
    "we cut the gordian knot by appealing to renormalization in coordinate space  @xcite .",
    "as we will show this enables to disentangle short and long distances in a way that the symmetry is kept at all non - vanishing distances .",
    "the main idea is to fix the scattering length independently of the potential by means of a suitable short distance boundary condition . as a result the undesirable dependence of observables on the potential is reduced at short distances , precisely the region where a determination of the nn force in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom becomes less reliable .",
    "let us review in the case of s - waves the renormalization procedure in coordinate space pursued elsewhere  @xcite and which will prove particularly suitable in the sequel .",
    "this is fully equivalent to introduce one counter - term in the cut - off lippmann - schwinger equation in momentum space ( see ref .",

    "hence , the general solution for a positive energy state @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 and using the low energy limit condition @xmath106 we obtain @xmath107 orthogonality between zero and finite energy states yields after evaluating the integrals @xmath108 and as a consequence the effective range vanishes @xmath109 , in accordance to the fact that the range of the potential is zero . for a negative energy state",
    "@xmath95 the normalized bound state is @xmath110 orthogonality between the zero energy and the bound state , again , yields the correlation @xmath111 in the appendix  [ sec : pert ] we illustrate further the procedure in the case of weak potentials for which a form of perturbation theory may be applied for the case of _ weak potentials _ but _ arbitrary _ scattering lengths .    before going further we should ponder on the need to take the limit @xmath80 , which corresponds to eliminating the cut - off .",
    "we note that the potential , @xmath112 , is used at _ all _ distances both in the standard approach , which involves the regular solution only , and the renormalization approach , which requires the regular as well as the irregular solution .",
    "however , the sensitivity to the short distance behaviour of the potential is quite different ; the standard approach displays much stronger dependence while the renormalization approach is fairly independent on the hardly accessible short distance region , a feature that becomes evident perturbatively ( see e.g. eq .  ( [ eq : r0_pert ] ) ) .",
    "this is in fact the key property that allows to eliminate the cut - off in the renormalization approach .",
    "thus , removing the cut - off does not mean that the obe potential is believed to hold all the way down to the origin .",
    "the procedure carried out before is described in purely quantum mechanical terms , but it can be mapped onto field theoretical terminology ; it is equivalent to the method of introducing one counter - term in the cut - off lippmann - schwinger equation in momentum space  @xcite . moreover , eq .",
