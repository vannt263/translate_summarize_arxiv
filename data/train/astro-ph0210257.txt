    "two competitive scenarios have been proposed to take into account for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , the cosmological constant and a plethora of ` quintessence ' scalar field models .",
    "it has been recently shown that an appropriate parameterization of the time behavior of the dark energy equation of state , can reproduce the dynamics of several quintessence potentials and many other models for the acceleration @xcite .",
    "in particular different models are specified by the value of the equation of state today @xmath0 , its value during the matter dominated era @xmath1 , the value of the scale factor @xmath2 where the equation of state changes from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and the width @xmath3 of this transition .",
    "we refer to the formula ( 4 ) of the equation of state in reference @xcite .",
    "we may distinguish two different classes of dark energy models , those with a rapid transition , characterized by the ratio @xmath4 , and those with a slowly varying behavior , for which @xmath5 .",
    "for instance the ` albrecht - skordis ' model @xcite belongs to the former class while the latter includes the inverse power law potential @xcite .",
    "we shall study the dark energy effects in the cmb power spectrum and we will discuss the possibility to detect these imprints with the next generation of cmb experiments .",
    "the angular size of the sound horizon at the decoupling sets the location of the acoustic peaks .",
    "different dark energy models can lead to a different angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface and consequently to a shift of the peaks .",
    "for instance if @xmath0 is close to the cosmological constant value , the universe starts to accelerate at earlier times , the distance to the last scattering surface is farther and the peaks are shifted toward larger multipoles .",
    "the opposite effect occurs if @xmath1 tends to the dust value or if @xmath2 tends to its present value @xmath6 , but in these cases the amplitude of the shift depends on the value of @xmath3 . in fig.1",
    "we plot the relative difference to a @xmath7cdm model of the position of the first , second and third peaks for rapidly varying models ( fig.1a-1b ) and slowly varying ones ( fig.1c-1d ) .",
    "we set @xmath8 . as we can see , in models with a rapidly varying equation of state the discrepancy with respect to the @xmath7cdm increases for @xmath9 ( fig.1a ) , while for slowly varying behaviors of the equation of state there is not dependence on @xmath2 ( fig.1c ) .",
    "this is what we expect since in the latter class of models a different value of @xmath2 does not affect the evolution of the dark energy density .",
    "we notice that in general the shift of the position of the first peak is always larger than that of the second and third ones .",
    "this is due to the isw effect that is a characteristic signature of dark energy at low multipoles .",
    "the location of the doppler peaks is an efficient tool to test the dark energy @xcite , however we should consider the degeneracy with other cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , for small values of @xmath10 the peaks are shifted toward large multipoles .",
    "the same effect occurs for large values of the physical baryon density @xmath11 , since the size of the sound horizon becomes smaller .",
    "therefore we expect the value of the dark energy parameters to be degenerate mainly with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the isw produces late time anisotropies at the large angular scales of the cmb and is caused by the decay of the gravitational potentials @xcite . in a @xmath7cdm model such a decay starts as soon as the universe enters in the cosmological constant dominated phase . on the other hand the quintessence contributes to this decay not only with the dynamics of the background but with its clustering properties as well .",
    "in fact the quintessence is not a smooth component , it has fluctuations that can cluster at the very large scales and modify the evolution of the matter perturbations",
    ". therefore the imprint of the dark energy in the isw depends on its specific features @xcite . in fig.2",
    "we plot the power spectrum @xmath12 for the models of fig.1 , the red line corresponds to the isw contribution in a @xmath7cdm model .",
    "as we can see , for rapidly varying models , there is a boost of power for transitions occurring at close redshifts ( fig.2a ) .",
    "the @xmath12 then decreases toward the cosmological constant case as the transition moves at higher redshifts ( fig.2a ) .",
    "the largest amplitude is obtained for @xmath13 , but the signal is suppressed for @xmath14 ( fig.2b ) . in the case of slowly varying models",
    "the isw is almost independent of @xmath2 ( fig.2c ) .",
    "it is larger than the @xmath7cdm for @xmath13 , becomes smaller for negative values of @xmath1 and tends to the @xmath7 case for @xmath15 ( fig.2d ) .",
    "the result of this qualitative analysis suggests that amid the dark energy models with @xmath0 close to @xmath16 , those with a rapid transition occurring at low redshifts produce the most distinctive signature in the cmb power spectrum . on the contrary those with a slowly varying behavior are more difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant model .",
    "in order to test the sensitivity of an ideal cmb experiment to the dark energy effects , we simulate a sample of @xmath17s with cosmic variance errors . we assume a fiducial model with a slowly varying equation of state with the following parameters : @xmath18",
    ", @xmath19 km @xmath20 @xmath21 , @xmath8 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "we assume a flat geometry , no tensor contribution , the scalar spectral index @xmath25 and the baryon density @xmath26 . we assume a gaussian prior on @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "we perform a likelihood analysis over @xmath29 , @xmath10 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.3 .",
    "as we may note , unless we take a prior on @xmath10 , the value of @xmath0 is poorly constrained .",
    "more important is the likelihood plot in the @xmath30 plane . as we expect , @xmath2 is undetermined . on the other hand @xmath1",
    "is not very well constrained even with the @xmath10 prior .",
    "this is because @xmath0 and @xmath1 are degenerate , hence marginalizing the likelihood over @xmath0 shifts the best fit value of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular we can not exclude the case @xmath31 .",
    "therefore we conclude that if the present value of the dark energy equation of state is close to @xmath16 , a large class of models will not be distinguished from a @xmath7cdm scenario even with ideal cmb measurements .",
    "it is possible that combining different cosmological data , as sn ia , large scale structure and quasar clustering we can break the degeneracy and infer more information on this class of dark energy models .",
