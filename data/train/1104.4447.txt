    "among the known exact solutions of einstein s field equations in general relativity there are two commonly studied metrics that describe spacetime in very different regimes .",
    "first , the friedmann  robertson",
    " walker ( frw ) metric describes the expansion of a homogeneous and isotropic universe in terms of the scale factor @xmath4 .",
    "the frw metric makes no reference to any particular mass points in the universe but , rather , describes a continuous , homogeneous and isotropic fluid on cosmological scales . instead of using a ` physical ' ( non - comoving ) radial coordinate @xmath1 ,",
    "it is usually written in terms of a comoving radial coordinate @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , such that the spatial coordinates of points moving with the hubble flow do not depend on the cosmic time @xmath7 .",
    "here the comoving coordinate @xmath5 is dimensionless , whereas the scale factor @xmath4 has units of length . for a spatially - flat frw universe , for example ,",
    "using physical coordinates , the metric is @xmath8\\,dt^2 + 2rh(t)\\,dr\\,dt - dr^2-r^2d\\omega^2,\\label{eq : frw}\\ ] ] which becomes @xmath9 in comoving coordinates , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the hubble parameter and primes denote differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath7 ( we will adopt natural units thoroughout , so that @xmath12 ) .",
    "second , the schwarzschild metric describes the spherically symmetric static gravitational field outside a non - rotating spherical mass and can be used to model spacetime outside a star , planet or black hole .",
    "normally the schwarzschild metric is given in ` physical ' coordinates and reads @xmath13 but another common representation of this spacetime uses the isotropic radial coordinate @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 the main problem with the schwarzschild metric in a cosmological context is that it ignores the dynamical expanding background in which the mass resides .",
    "@xcite combined the schwarzschild and frw metrics to produce a new spherically - symmetric metric that describes a point mass embedded in an expanding spatially - flat universe .",
    "mcvittie demanded that :    1 .   at large distances from the mass the metric",
    "is given approximately by the frw metric ( [ eq : frwco ] ) ; 2 .   when expansion is ignored , so that @xmath17 , one obtains the schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates ( [ eq : schwiso ] ) ( whereby @xmath18 , with @xmath19 defined below ) ; 3 .",
    "the metric is a consistent solution to einstein s field equations with a perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor ; 4 .",
    "there is no radial matter infall .",
    "mcvittie derived a metric satisfying these criteria for a spatially - flat background universe : @xmath20 where @xmath19 has been used to indicate mcvittie s dimensionless radial coordinate , rather than our ` physical ' coordinate . in section",
    "[ sec : coordtrans ] we will see how the two are related and point out some of the problems with ( [ eq : mcvittieflat ] ) .",
    "one sees that ( [ eq : mcvittieflat ] ) is a natural combination of ( [ eq : frwco ] ) and ( [ eq : schwiso ] ) ; nonetheless , there has been a long debate about its physical interpretation .",
    "this uncertainty has recently been resolved by @xcite and @xcite , who have shown that mcvittie s metric _ does _ indeed describe a point - mass in an otherwise spatially - flat frw universe .",
    "in this paper we have also independently arrived at the same conclusion , as discussed in section [ sec : coordtrans ] .",
    "mcvittie also generalised his solution to accommodate spatially - curved cosmologies , which are discussed further in section [ sec : mcvittiecomparison ] .    for a given matter",
    "energy - momentum tensor , einstein s field equations for the metric @xmath21 constitute a set of non - linear differential equations that are notoriously difficult to solve . moreover , the freedom to use different coordinate systems , as illustrated above , can obscure the interpretation of the physical quantities . in a previous paper ,",
    "@xcite presented a new approach to solving the field equations . in this method ,",
    "one begins by postulating a tetrad ( or frame ) field consistent with spherical symmetry but with unknown coefficients , and the field equations are instead solved for these coefficients . in this paper , we follow the approach of @xcite to derive afresh the metric for a point mass embedded in an expanding universe , both for spatially - flat and curved cosmologies , and compare our results with mcvittie s metrics and with work conducted by other authors on similar models .",
    "we also discuss the physical consequences of our derived metrics , focussing in particular on particle dynamics and the force required to keep a test particle at rest relative to the point mass .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the tetrad - based method for solving the einstein equations for spherically - symmetric systems , and derive the metrics for a point mass embedded in an expanding universe for spatially - flat , open and closed cosmologies . in section 3 ,",
    "we compare our metrics with those derived by mcvittie .",
    "the geodesic equations for our spatially - flat metric are derived and interpreted in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we derive a general invariant expression , valid for arbitrary spherically - symmetric spacetimes , for the force required to keep a test particle at rest relative to the central point mass , and consider the form of this force for our derived metrics .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "we note that this paper is the first in a set of two . in our second paper ( nandra , lasenby & hobson 2011 ; hereinafter nlh2 )",
    ", we focus on some of the astrophysical consequences of this work .",
    "in particular , we investigate and interpret the zeros in our derived force expression for the constitutents of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "we derive the metric for a point mass in an expanding universe using a tetrad - based approach in general relativity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; our method is essentially a translation of that originally presented by @xcite in the language of geometric algebra .",
    "first consider a riemannian spacetime in which events are labelled with a set of coordinates @xmath22 , such that each point in spacetime has corresponding coordinate basis vectors @xmath23 , related to the metric via @xmath24 . at each point",
    "we may also define a _ local lorentz frame _ by another set of orthogonal basis vectors @xmath25 ( roman indices ) .",
    "these are not derived from any coordinate system and are related to the minkowski metric @xmath26 via @xmath27 .",
    "one can describe a vector @xmath28 at any point in terms of its components in either basis : for example @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the relationship between the two sets of basis vectors is defined in terms of tetrads , or vierbeins @xmath31 , where the inverse is denoted @xmath32 : @xmath33 it is not difficult to show that the metric elements are given in terms of the tetrads by @xmath34 .",
    "we now consider a spherically - symmetric system , in which case the tetrads may be defined in terms of four unknown functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "note that dependencies on both @xmath1 and @xmath7 will often be suppressed in the equations presented below , whereas we will usually make explicit dependency on either @xmath1 and @xmath7 alone .",
    "we may take the non - zero tetrad components and their inverses to be @xmath39 in so doing , we have made use of the invariance of general relativity under local rotations of the lorentz frames to align @xmath40 and @xmath41 with the coordinate basis vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 at each point .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that a natural gauge choice is one in which @xmath44 , which we will assume from now on .",
    "this is called the ` newtonian gauge ' because it allows simple newtonian interpretations , as we shall see .",
    "using the tetrads to calculate the metric coefficients leads to the line element @xmath45    we now define the two linear differential operators @xmath46 and additionally define the functions @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 by @xmath50 where @xmath2 is a constant . assuming the matter is a perfect fluid with density @xmath51 and pressure @xmath52 , einstein s field equations and the bianchi identities can be used to yield relationships between the unknown quantities , as listed below @xcite : @xmath53 from the @xmath54 equation we now see that @xmath55 plays the role of an intrinsic mass ( or energy ) interior to @xmath1 , and from the @xmath56 equation",
    "it also becomes clear that @xmath57 is interpreted as a radial acceleration .",
    "in such a physical set up @xmath2 is the cosmological constant .    in order to determine specific forms for the above functions it is sensible to start with a definition of the mass @xmath49 .",
    "for a static matter distribution the density is a function of @xmath1 alone , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "setting @xmath60 equal to a constant @xmath61 leads specifically to the exterior schwarzschild metric in ` physical ' coordinates ( [ eq : schw ] ) . for a homogeneous background cosmology , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , leading to the frw metric in ` physical ' coordinates ( [ eq : frw ] ) . in this work",
    "we choose @xmath55 to describe a point object with constant mass @xmath61 , embedded in a background fluid with uniform but time - dependent spatial density : @xmath64 which is easily shown to be consistent with the @xmath54 equation above .    we point out that the background fluid is in fact a total ` effective ' fluid , made up of two components : baryonic matter with ordinary gas pressure , and dark matter with an effective pressure that arises from the motions of dark matter particles having undergone phase - mixing and relaxation ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the degree of pressure support that the dark matter provides depends on the degree of phase - mixing and relaxation that the dark matter particles have undergone , which ( in the non - static , non - virialised case ) will be a variable function of space and time .",
    "the properties of this single ` phenomenological ' fluid , with an overall density @xmath65 , are studied in more detail in our companion paper nlh2 .",
    "here we simply calculate the total pressure @xmath52 of the background fluid required , in the presence of a point mass @xmath61 , to solve the einstein field equations in the spherically - symmetric case .",
    "the ` boundary condition ' on this pressure ( at least for a flat or open universe , where spatial infinity can be reached ) is that the pressure tends at infinity to the value appropriate for the type of cosmological fluid assumed .",
    "this is @xmath66 in the present case , since we are matching to a dust cosmology .",
    "the total pressure at finite @xmath1 may be thought of as a sum of the baryonic gas pressure and dark matter pressure , but without an explicit non - linear multi - fluid treatment we do not break the fluid up into its components in the strong - field analysis presented below .",
    "note that the central point mass in our model is inevitably surrounded by an event horizon .",
    "the fluid contained within this region remains trapped and can not take part in the universal background expansion , and so our expression for @xmath55 in ( [ eq : mdefn ] ) is only valid outside the schwarzschild radius .",
    "we thus expect the metric describing the spacetime to break down at this point .",
    "however , since one is usually most interested in the region @xmath67 ( roughly equivalent to @xmath68 ) , it is appropriate to continue using this definition for @xmath55 to study particle dynamics far away from the central point mass .",
    "we are able to use ( [ eq : mdefn ] ) to determine specific forms for the tetrad components .",
    "we first substitute it into the @xmath69 equation from ( [ eq : alleqns ] ) and simplify to obtain @xmath70 combining this result with the @xmath71 equation from ( [ eq : alleqns ] ) and the definition of @xmath72 from ( [ eq : quantities ] ) , one quickly finds that @xmath73 this is easily solved for @xmath74 , and hence @xmath72 , to yield @xmath75 where @xmath76 is some arbitrary function of @xmath7 . substituting these expressions into the @xmath77 equation from ( [ eq : alleqns ] ) , and using the definition of @xmath55 from ( [ eq : quantities ] ) to fix the integration constant , one finds that @xmath78 where we have defined the new function @xmath79 it should be noted that , by interpreting @xmath76 as the hubble parameter , the three terms on the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : curvature ] ) correspond to @xmath80 via the friedmann equation for a homogeneous and isotropic universe , where @xmath81 is the curvature parameter and @xmath4 is the scale factor . calculating the function @xmath57 is now straightforward from its definition in ( [ eq : quantities ] ) : @xmath82 finally , the function @xmath83 can then be calculated from the @xmath84 equation in ( [ eq : alleqns ] ) .",
    "we thus have expressions for all the required functions @xmath83 , @xmath85 , @xmath74 , @xmath72 and @xmath57 .",
    "we conclude our general discussion by noting the relationship between the fluid pressure @xmath86 and the function @xmath83 . combining the @xmath84 and @xmath56 equations in ( [ eq : alleqns ] ) , one quickly finds @xmath87 this first - order linear differential equation can be easily solved for @xmath86 by finding the appropriate integrating factor , and one obtains @xmath88 where @xmath89 is , in general , an arbitrary function of @xmath7 . combining this result with ( [ eq : drhodt ] ) , ( [ eq : fsolution ] ) and ( [ eq : curvature ] ) , and recalling that @xmath90 , one quickly finds that @xmath91.\\ ] ] using the friedmann acceleration equation for a homogeneous and isotropic universe , one then finds that @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the equation - of - state parameter of the cosmological fluid .",
    "hence the relationship ( [ eq : generalp ] ) between the fluid pressure and @xmath83 becomes simply @xmath94 .",
    "\\label{eq : generalp2}\\ ] ] for an frw universe without a point mass ( @xmath95 ) , in which @xmath96 , we recover the relationship @xmath97 .      [",
    "sec : flatmetric ]    a number of observational studies , such as wmap @xcite , indicate that the universe is spatially flat , or at least very close to being so . in this case @xmath98 and the resulting expressions for the quantities @xmath85 , @xmath74 , @xmath72 , @xmath57 and @xmath83 are easily obtained ; these are listed in the left - hand column of table  [ table : params ] .",
    "we note that the given expression for @xmath83 is obtained by imposing the boundary condition @xmath99 as @xmath100 ; from ( [ eq : generalp2 ] ) this follows from the physically reasonable boundary condition that the fluid pressure @xmath101 as @xmath102 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is found that the background densities already match in both models and correspond to the density obtained from the frw metric ; this is not suprising since we are still working within an frw background .",
    "we can use the different forms for the pressure to define a coordinate transformation : @xmath103 it is easily shown that our metric is equal to mcvittie s metric under this transformation .",
    "the transformation actually converts our ` physical ' radial coordinate to its comoving and isotropic analogue in a single step .",
    "hence our metric describes the same spacetime as mcvittie s metric , with the bonus that its interpretation is more transparent in our non - comoving coordinates .",
    "note that the limit @xmath104 corresponds to @xmath105 , leading back to the frw pressure in both cases , as expected .",
    "the limit @xmath106 on the other hand , which also corresponds to @xmath107 , is not well - defined . as pointed out by @xcite , and more recently @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that there is a spacelike singularity in mcvittie s metric at @xmath108 , corresponding to a diverging pressure .",
    "the interpretation of this singularity has been under debate for some time , but we now see that it corresponds simply to the physical singularity at @xmath109 in our coordinate system .",
    "this in turn coincides with the location of the event horizon from which the background fluid is unable to escape , as discussed in section  [ sec : flatmetric ] .",
    "thus mcvittie s metric can only be valid for @xmath110 .",
    "this transformation to ` physical ' coordinates has also previously been pointed out by @xcite and other authors @xcite .",
    "they have also highlighted the ` accident ' by which mcvittie initially derived his metric , which in its original form does not describe a _",
    "central _ mass .",
    "the mass @xmath61 is located at @xmath111 in our setup , but this does not correspond to the radial coordinate @xmath112 .",
    "instead the point mass is located at @xmath113 , which seems rather unnatural .",
    "mcvittie s accident led to problems in the cases of spatially curved cosmologies , as we shall see shortly .",
    "@xcite used the transformation ( [ eq : coordtrans ] ) to allow for a more intuitive analysis of the global properties of mcvittie s metric .",
    "in particular , nolan identified the function @xmath49 in ( [ eq : mdefn ] ) as the misner  sharp energy of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "this is a measure of the ` total energy ' of each fluid sphere in terms of the work done on it by the surrounding fluid .",
    "we note that this was the starting point in our derivation of the metric ( [ eq : flat ] ) , as opposed to an emergent feature .",
    "it therefore clarifies a point that has been under debate for a long time ; mcvittie s metric _ does _ indeed describe a point - mass in an otherwise spatially - flat frw universe ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we have already shown that an advantage of our approach is that we have a natural way of generalising to the case of a curved cosmology . for @xmath114 ,",
    "our model still incorporates an frw background so we would again expect our form for @xmath65 not to deviate from the standard frw result ; in particular , it should be a function of @xmath7 only .",
    "indeed , using the general metric ( [ eq : generalmetric ] ) with @xmath85 and @xmath74 given in table  [ table : params ] , we find ( again assuming @xmath115 for simplicity ) @xmath116 where the series solutions for @xmath83 for the cases @xmath117 and @xmath118 are given in ( [ eq : f1approx ] ) and ( [ eq : f1powerc2 ] ) , respectively .    for mcvittie s metric ( [ eq : mcvittiegeneral ] ) , however , we find the peculiar feature that the background density does depend on the radial coordinate @xmath19 : @xmath119 where @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "this is odd since the only apparent difference between this model and the spatially - flat case is the spacetime curvature .",
    "@xmath114 metrics hence can not describe a mass particle embedded in a background with homogeneous density . indeed the density and pressure ( [ eq : opendensity ] ) do not even asymptotically tend to the frw solutions .",
    "our @xmath114 metrics , which are derived by explicitly assuming a model of a point mass embedded in a homogeneous background , are therefore inherently different to mcvittie s solutions .",
    "@xcite has used a model similar to ours to obtain a metric in the @xmath117 case that is expressed in terms of an elliptic function , but we have not yet found a coordinate transformation that equates this with our solution",
    ". a full comparison will be the subject of future research .",
    "the motion of a test particle moving under gravity around a central point mass in a static spacetime has been very well studied . in simple terms",
    ", we would expect the incorporation of an expanding background to provide an additional ` force ' that alters the trajectory of the test particle .",
    "we investigate this possibility by first calculating the geodesic equations for our metric , using the usual ` lagrangian ' technique .",
    "we restrict our attention to the @xmath121 case , since observations indicate the universe to be very close to spatially flat @xcite .",
    "working in the equatorial plane @xmath122 , the ` lagrangian ' corresponding to our flat metric ( [ eq : flat ] ) is @xmath123\\dot{t}^2+\\frac{2rh(t)}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{2m}{r}}}\\dot{r}\\dot{t}-\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{2m}{r}}\\dot{r}^2-r^2\\dot{\\phi}^2,\\nonumber\\ ] ] where dots denote differentiation with respect to the proper time @xmath124 of the test particle .",
    "the three remaining geodesic equations are obtained from the euler - lagrange equations @xmath125 for @xmath126 , @xmath1 and @xmath127 . for stationary , spherically - symmetric metrics , such as the schwarzschild metric , one",
    "can immediately obtain the first integrals of the @xmath7 and @xmath127 geodesic equations .",
    "moreover , it is usual to replace the @xmath1 geodesic equation by its first integral @xmath128 ( for timelike geodesics ) .",
    "these three equations can then be easily combined to obtain an ` energy equation ' in terms of @xmath1 , @xmath129 and constants of the motion only . by differentiating this equation ,",
    "a simple expression for @xmath130 can be obtained , if desired .",
    "this procedure is followed for the schwarzschild de sitter metric by @xcite .",
    "our metric , however , is a function of both @xmath1 and @xmath7 , and therefore this standard approach does not prove useful in finding @xmath130 and the procedure must be modified .    in our case , the @xmath1 geodesic equation is not replaced since it contains an @xmath130 term .",
    "this is of particular interest to us in determining the nature of the gravitational ` forces ' acting on the particle .",
    "the @xmath127 geodesic equation is @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the specific angular momentum of the test particle . substituting this into the @xmath1 equation and rearranging gives @xmath133 the @xmath134 term",
    "can be eliminated completely using the @xmath7-equation , so that ( [ eq : grgeodesic ] ) now becomes @xmath135 note that the @xmath136 terms above , when combined , differ very slightly from that derived in @xcite ; we believe the latter to be in error .",
    "we now use the condition @xmath128 to eliminate the @xmath136 terms . after some algebraic manipulation this finally leads to a relatively simple exact expression for @xmath130 , namely @xmath137      it is of interest to consider special cases of ( [ eq : fullgeodesic ] ) .",
    "first we consider the weak field approximation by assuming @xmath138 and expanding to leading order in small quantities .",
    "we also take the low - velocity limit @xmath139 , @xmath140 . in this newtonian limit",
    ", we find @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "this result can also be obtained directly from our flat metric ( [ eq : flat ] ) in its newtonian limit @xcite : @xmath143dt^2 + 2rh(t)drdt - dr^2-r^2d\\omega^2.\\ ] ] note that this incorporates the usual low velocity approximation , but the weak field condition used is simply @xmath144 . incorporating the condition",
    "@xmath145 as well simply leads to the flat minkowski metric , which does not effectively describe the physical system in which we are interested .    we may interpret ( [ eq : newtgeo ] ) as the physical acceleration of the test particle in the newtonian limit , and hence the gravitational force per unit mass acting upon it . aside from the ` centrifugal ' term depending on the specific angular momentum @xmath132 , the terms in ( [ eq : newtgeo ] ) correspond to the standard @xmath0 inwards force due to the central mass and a cosmological force proportional to @xmath1",
    "that is directed outwards ( inwards ) when the expansion of the universe is accelerating ( decelerating ) .",
    "an interesting feature of the cosmological force is that its direction ( and magnitude ) depends on whether the universe is accelerating or decelerating ( as determined by the sign of @xmath146 ) .",
    "this was pointed out previously by @xcite , and highlights the common misconception of there being some force or drag associated simply with the expansion of space ; instead the force is better associated with the _ acceleration / deceleration of the expansion_. in particular , we note that if the universe is decelerating , the cosmological force is directed inwards and the test particle inevitably moves towards the central mass @xmath61 , falls through its position and joins onto the hubble flow on the other side .",
    "this does not , however , argue against the idea of the expansion of space .",
    "since the current deceleration parameter @xmath147 of the universe is measured to be approximately @xmath148 @xcite , we see that the present - day cosmological force is directed outwards , as one might have naively expected intuitively .",
    "however , since the expansion history of the current concordance model of cosmology changes from a decelerating phase to an accelerating phase at a relatively recent cosmic time , the cosmological force must reverse direction at this epoch .",
    "a realistic scale factor corresponding to the standard spatially - flat concordance model is @xcite : @xmath149^{\\frac{1}{3}},\\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath150 @xcite is the current fraction of the critical density of the universe in the form of dark energy . using this expression , in fig .",
    "[ fig : redshift ] we plot the ratio of the cosmological force relative to its present - day value , as a function of redshift @xmath151 .",
    "as anticipated , we see that the cosmological force reverses direction ; it is an inwards force for redshifts larger than about @xmath152 .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the force relative to its current value increases by a factor of @xmath153 by about @xmath154 and by a factor of nearly @xmath155 by @xmath156 ; it continues to grow with redshift quickly thereafter .",
    "the cosmological force appears to have been correctly taken into account in cosmological simulation codes .",
    "for example , in @xcite and @xcite , dark matter and stars are modelled as self - gravitating collisionless fluids following the collisionless boltzmann equation , and this term appears in the equation of motion of the particles . for a single central mass @xmath61 , the equation of motion of a test particle",
    "is taken as @xmath157 where @xmath5 represents comoving coordinates . converting to",
    "` physical ' coordinates via @xmath158 recovers the result ( [ eq : newtgeo ] ) with @xmath159 .",
    "we perform a full exploration of the astrophysical consequences of the geodesic equation ( [ eq : newtgeo ] ) in our companion paper nlh2 .",
    "we also note that @xcite has used a very similar geodesic equation to analyse the motion of an electron orbiting a central nucleus , with a slight modification to account for the dominant electrostatic force in that problem .",
    "an extension of this work is also presented in nlh2 .",
    "it is , of course , of interest to calculate the ` force ' experienced by the particle in the fully general - relativistic case .",
    "this is discussed in detail in the next section , but as a prelude let us return briefly to ( [ eq : fullgeodesic ] ) and consider a particle released from rest , for which @xmath160 .",
    "thus , instantaneously , one has @xmath161",
    "one should bear in mind at this point , however , that the ` physical ' coordinate @xmath1 is not a proper radial distance . hence one can not simply interpret ( [ eq : finalgeodesic ] ) as the instantaneous force on a particle released from rest , or equivalently the negative of the force required to keep a test particle at rest relative to the central point mass . the proper expression for this force",
    "is derived in the next section .",
    "we now derive a fully general - relativistic invariant expression , valid for any spherically - symmetric system , for the radial force required to hold a test particle at rest relative to the central point mass .",
    "we first point out that the relationship between the ` physical ' coordinate @xmath1 and proper radial distance @xmath162 to the point mass is defined through @xmath163 .",
    "it is therefore only in the spatially - flat case , for which @xmath164 is independent of @xmath7 , that @xmath165 or @xmath166 are equivalent conditions . in general",
    ", one must thus choose which condition defines ` at rest ' . here",
    "we will adopt the condition @xmath165 , which corresponds physically to keeping the test particle on the surface of a sphere with proper area @xmath167 . in practice",
    ", it would probably be easier for an astronaut ( i.e. test particle ) to make a local measurement to determine the proper area of the sphere on which he is located , rather than to determine his proper distance to the point mass , particularly in the presence of horizons . with this proviso , our derivation is valid for arbitrary tetrad components @xmath83 , @xmath85 and @xmath74 ( but we assume the newtonian gauge @xmath44 ) .    in general , the invariant force ( per unit mass ) acting on a particle is equal simply to its proper acceleration , i.e. the acceleration of the particle as measured in its instantaneous rest frame .",
    "we must therefore find an expression for the proper acceleration of a particle held at rest relative to the central point mass .",
    "this may be calculated directly in the coordinate basis , but it is more instructive for our purposes , and simpler , to perform the calculation in the tetrad frame .",
    "the tetrad frame defines a family of ideal observers , such that the integral curves of the timelike unit vector field @xmath168 are the worldlines of these observers , and at each event along a given worldline , the three spacelike unit vector fields @xmath25 @xmath169 specify the spatial triad carried by the observer .",
    "the triad may be thought of as defining the spatial coordinate axes of a local laboratory frame , which is valid very near the observer s worldline . in general , the worldlines of these observers need not be timelike geodesics , and hence the observers may be accelerating .",
    "let us first consider the four - velocity and proper acceleration of the observer defined by our tetrad frame ( [ eq : tetrads ] ) .",
    "the four - velocity of the observer is simply @xmath170 , so that , by construction , the components of the four - velocity in the tetrad frame are @xmath171 = [ 1,0,0,0]$ ] .",
    "since @xmath172 , the four - velocity may be written in terms of the tetrad components and the coordinate basis vectors as @xmath173 .",
    "thus , the components of the observer s four - velocity in the coordinate basis are simply @xmath174 = [ \\dot{t},\\dot{r},\\dot{\\theta},\\dot{\\phi}]=[f_1,g_2,0,0]$ ] , where dots denote differentiation with respect to the observer s proper time .",
    "hence , for all our previously derived metrics , we see from table  [ table : params ] that @xmath175 .",
    "since the comoving radial coordinate is defined through @xmath176 , we deduce that @xmath177 .",
    "hence the observer is not comoving with the hubble flow .",
    "instead , since @xmath178 is negative , the observer s comoving radial coordinate is decreasing .",
    "this behaviour is due to the presence of the central point mass , which results in our observer not moving geodesically ( except as @xmath179 ) .",
    "this is easily seen by calculating the proper acceleration @xmath180 of our observer , which is given by @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the four - acceleration of the observer .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , for a body moving with general four - velocity @xmath28 , the four - acceleration is given in terms of the coordinate basis and the tetrad basis respectively by @xmath183 where @xmath184 are the connection coefficients corresponding to the metric ( [ eq : generalmetric ] ) and @xmath185 are known as ricci s coefficients of rotation or the spin - connection .",
    "it has been shown by , for example , @xcite that these can be written in terms of the tetrad components as @xmath186 it follows that @xmath187 is anti - symmetric in the first two indices , and @xmath188 is anti - symmetric in the last two indices .",
    "for general radial motion @xmath189 , in which case the components of the four - acceleration in the tetrad frame reduce to @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "it follows that for general radial motion only @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) and @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) need to be computed . using ( [ eq : cdefn ] ) , the definitions of the tetrads and their inverses ( [ eq : tetrads ] ) and the relations given in equation ( [ eq : quantities ] ) , one can show that @xmath196 this highlights that the functions @xmath72 and @xmath57 defined earlier are in fact components of the spin - connection ; indeed this is how @xcite originally defined them , but using geometric algebra .",
    "hence the components of the four - acceleration in the tetrad frame for general radial motion are @xmath197    if we now specialise to the case where @xmath198 , the four - velocity of our observer , then @xmath171=[1,0,0,0]$ ] , and so @xmath199 = [ 0,g,0,0]$ ] .",
    "thus the proper acceleration of our observer is @xmath200 , which coincides with our earlier identification of @xmath57 as a radial acceleration .",
    "equivalently , the invariant force per unit rest mass @xmath201 ( provided , for example , by a rocket engine ) required to keep the observer in this state of motion has magnitude @xmath57 in the outwards radial direction .",
    "let us now consider a particle in general radial motion such that its four - velocity components in the tetrad frame are @xmath202,\\label{eq : velalpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath203 is the particle s rapidity in that frame and @xmath124 is the particle s proper time . using the tetrad definitions ( [ eq : tetrads ] ) one can show that these components are related to those in the coordinate basis by @xmath204    substituting the coefficients ( [ eq : velalpha ] ) into the equations in ( [ eq : v2 ] ) , we find that the components of the particle s four - acceleration in the tetrad frame are given by @xmath205 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "@xmath165 and from ( [ eq : rdotgeneral ] ) it is found that @xmath211 .",
    "moreover , since the magnitude of the four - velocity must be unity , we deduce that @xmath212 .",

    "we thus obtain @xmath219.\\label{eq : finalforcegen2}\\ ] ] hence , the required force is determined by the tetrad components themselves and also some of their derivatives with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath1 ( the latter through the functions @xmath72 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "it is of interest to compare our expression for @xmath201 in ( [ eq : finalforcegen ] ) with the expression ( [ eq : rddotultimate ] ) for @xmath130 in the special case of a particle _ released _ from rest , for which @xmath220 and @xmath165 . in this case , using ( [ eq : covvol ] ) , we find that , instantaneously , @xmath221 .",

    "below , we will obtain the expressions for @xmath201 in each of our newly - derived metrics . before we consider each metric separately",
    ", however , it is worth noting that the force ( [ eq : finalforcegen2 ] ) becomes singular at any point where @xmath223 . in the case of our newly derived metrics , we see from table  [ table : params ] that this corresponds to where @xmath224 which is valid for @xmath121 and @xmath114 .",

    "consequently , provided @xmath230 $ ] , ( [ eq : forcesings ] ) has three real roots , one of which lies at negative @xmath1 and the remaining two lie at @xmath231 and @xmath232 given by ( [ eq : cubicsols ] ) , but with @xmath4 replaced by @xmath233 . in particular , the force @xmath201 becomes infinite _ outside _ the schwarzschild radius @xmath109 and _ inside _ the ` scaled ' hubble radius @xmath234 .",
    "the functions defining the metric for a point mass embedded in a spatially - flat universe @xmath235 are given in table  [ table : params ] .",
    "to calculate @xmath201 , we must also evaluate @xmath236 and @xmath237 , which are easily shown to be @xmath238 thus the outward force @xmath201 required to keep a test particle at rest relative to the central point mass is @xmath239    comparing ( [ eq : flatforcefull ] ) with the expression ( [ eq : finalgeodesic ] ) giving the instantaneous value of @xmath130 for a particle released from rest in this spacetime , we see that they indeed obey the relationship ( [ eq : fvsddotr ] ) . assuming @xmath240 , expanding ( [ eq : flatforcefull ] ) in small quantities one finds that the zeroth order term is simply @xmath241 , consistent with newtonian gravity .",

    "finally , for comparison against the equivalent open and closed universe results , note that keeping all terms up to second order in small quantities leads to the expression @xmath243      the functions defining the @xmath117 metric are listed in table [ table : params ] , and it can be shown that @xmath236 and @xmath237 are given by @xmath244 thus the expression for the required outward force is @xmath245f_1}{\\left(1-\\frac{2m}{r}+\\frac{r^2}{r^2(t ) } -r^2h^2(t)\\right)^{3/2}}.\\label{eq : openforcefull}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath246 , this expression reduces to the force ( [ eq : flatforcefull ] ) in the spatially - flat case , as might be expected .    assuming that @xmath138 , expanding ( [ eq : openforcefull ] ) in small quantities and keeping only the leading terms at first order , the force is found to be given by equation ( [ eq : forcefinal ] ) .",
    "thus in this limit the force in an open universe is indistiguishable from that in a spatially - flat universe .",
    "the differences between the two become visible only when expanding up to second order in small quantities : @xmath247 the only difference between this expression and the corresponding spatially - flat result ( [ eq : forcefinalexpanded ] ) is the extra negative contribution proportional to @xmath248 .",
    "this can be interpreted as an ` anti - gravitational ' force experienced by the test particle due to a virtual ` image ' mass dragged out to the curvature scale of the universe .",
    "since @xmath249 this term is negligible compared to the @xmath241 term , and hence the force is not significantly altered relatively to the spatially - flat case .      the functions defining the closed universe ( @xmath118 ) metric are listed in table [ table : params ] . in this case , @xmath250 thus the expression for the required outward force is @xmath251f_1}{\\left(1-\\frac{2m}{r } -\\frac{r^2}{r^2(t ) } -r^2h^2(t)\\right)^{3/2}}.\\label{eq : closedforcefull}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath246 , this expression also reduces to the force ( [ eq : flatforcefull ] ) in the spatially - flat case .    assuming that @xmath138 , expanding ( [ eq : closedforcefull ] ) in small quantities and keeping the leading terms up to first order , the force is once again found to be given by equation ( [ eq : forcefinal ] ) . in this limit",
    "the force in a closed universe is thus indistiguishable from that in a spatially - flat or open universe .",
    "any differences again only become visible when expanding up to second order in small quantities : @xmath252 thus we see that the only difference between this force and the corresponding result ( [ eq : forcefinalopen ] ) for an open universe is the sign of the extra contribution proportional to @xmath248 . in a closed universe , this contribution to the force by the ` image ' mass , which in this case can be viewed as a real object , is of the same sign as that due to the original mass .",
    "once again , however , since @xmath249 this term is negligible compared to the @xmath241 term , and hence the force is not significantly altered relative to the spatially - flat case .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a tetrad - based method for solving einstein s field equations in general relativity for spherically - symmetric systems .",
    "our method is essentially a translation of the method originally presented by @xcite in the language of geometric algebra .",
    "we use this technique to derive the metrics describing a point mass embedded in an homogeneous and isotropic expanding fluid , for a spatially - flat , open and closed universe , respectively . in the closed universe case",
    ", the lack of the notion of spatial infinity means that considerable care is required to determine the appropriate boundary conditions on the solution .",
    "we find that in the spatially - flat case , our metric is related by a coordinate transformation to the corresponding metric derived by @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , our use of ` physical ' coordinates greatly facilitates the physical interpretaion of the solution . for the open and closed universes , however , our metrics differ from the corresponding mcvittie metrics , which we believe to be incorrect .",
    "we derive the geodesic equation for the motion of a test particle under gravity in our spatially - flat metric . for radial motion in the newtonian limit",
    ", we find that the gravitational force on a test particle consists of the standard @xmath0 inwards force due to the central mass and a cosmological force proportional to @xmath1 that is directed outwards ( inwards ) when the expansion of the universe is accelerating ( decelerating ) .",
    "for the standard @xmath2cdm concordance cosmology , the cosmological force thus reverses direction at about @xmath3 , when the expansion of the universe makes a transition from a decelerating to an accelerating phase .",
    "it is expected that this phenomenon has a significant impact on the growth and evolution of structure , particularly around @xmath253 ; a detailed investigation of this is a subject for further study .",
    "nonetheless , we believe this effect is implicitly included in existing numerical simulation codes . in our companion paper nlh2 , we will show how the cosmological force leads to a maximum size for a bound object such as a galaxy or cluster , and explore the stability of bound orbits around the central mass .",
    "we also used our tetrad - based approach to derive an invariant fully general - relativistic expression , valid for arbitrary spherically - symmetric systems , for the force required to keep a test particle at rest relative to the central mass .",
    "we apply this result to our derived metrics in the spatially - flat , open and closed cases . to first order in small quantities",
    "the force in all three cases is the same , but differences become visible when considering the second order terms .",
    "interestingly , we find that the force in an open universe has an additional component that may be interpreted as a gravitationally repulsive term due to an ` image ' mass @xmath61 dragged out to the curvature scale of the universe .",
    "a similar term , but with the opposite sign , is present in the force in a closed universe , and results from an image mass at the antipodal point of the universe . in both cases , however , the additional components are neglible at distances from the original central mass that are small compared with the curvature scale , and so in practical terms the force in a spatially - curved universe is not significantly different from that in the spatially - flat case .",
    "it must be pointed out that our assumption that the background fluid density @xmath65 is spatially uniform may be questionable , since the point mass breaks homogeneity .",
    "the correct treatment of the background may require @xmath254 also to depend on the radial coordinate @xmath1 , which would significantly complicate the equations and would probably not yield analytical solutions .",
    "it is interesting that mcvittie s @xmath114 solutions do in fact yield background densities dependent on both @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",
    "nonetheless , since the point mass in our model does not occupy any space in the background , and also because we have ultimately been interested in @xmath67 , assuming @xmath62 is a good approximation .",
    "note that we will improve our model by accounting for the finite size of the central object in a subsequent paper .",
    "we will consider only spatially homogenous objects for simplicity , but we leave the consideration of more general radial density profiles for future research .",
    "we also note that our approach may be extended to systems with accretion onto the central mass by the replacement of @xmath255 in equation ( [ eq : mdefn ] ) ; a full analysis of this will also be presented in a future publication .",
