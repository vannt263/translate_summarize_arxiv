    "topological defects and liquid crystal phases are hopelessly intertwined . historically , the nematic phase derived it s name from the observation of long disclination lines . in some liquid crystal phases , such as the twist - grain - boundary ( tgb ) phases and blue phases ,",
    "these defects are not simply artifact or nuisance , but instead act to stabilize the director field configuration .",
    "while the tgb phases have smectic order , the blue phases have purely nematic - like order created by a long range , triply periodic lattice of line defects .",
    "two of the nematic blue phases possess cubic symmetry ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) while the third ( @xmath2 ) is thought to be an isotropic melt of double - twist cylinders @xcite .",
    "recently , new phases of matter have been identified that possess the quasi - long range translational order of smectics  @xcite in addition to three - dimensional orientational order .",
    "these phases , dubbed the `` smectic blue phases , '' have been observed for molecules in the chiral series fh / fh / hh-@xmath3btmhc , where @xmath3 is the aliphatic chain length .",
    "three distinct smectic blue phases have been observed near the isotropic transition of these compounds : @xmath4 has cubic symmetry , @xmath5 has orthorhombic symmetry and @xmath6 is isotropic  @xcite",
    ". the precise physical properties of these materials have been the study of intense investigation in recent years  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "since smectic order is incompatible with cubic symmetry , it is expected that any triply periodic crystalline structure must include smectic dislocations as well as disclinations .",
    "however , attempts to construct smectic double - twist cylinders  @xcite and assemble them into traditional blue phase structures  @xcite present a variety of difficulties , most notably a disagreement with precise experimental details  @xcite . in previous work",
    "@xcite we proposed a new model for the smectic blue phases .",
    "our construction filled space with concentric minimal surfaces wrapping a lattice of intersecting line defects .",
    "we found that when the saddle - splay constant was large enough , these new structures were stable . though the new materials were chiral , our construction did not rely on macroscopic chirality as in the traditional blue phases .",
    "instead , the smectic compression and bending energies set the length scale of our solutions .    here ,",
    "we refine our earlier model through variations on the original construction .",
    "we find that by allowing edge dislocations our phase is stabilized for even small ( negative ) values of the saddle - splay constant @xmath7 .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : energetics ] we discuss the rotationally - invariant energetics of layered systems and derive detailed equations for the geometric frustration between curvature and uniform layer spacing .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : smallcore ] , we calculate the energy and stability of likely smectic structures based on our original construction  @xcite . to supplement our analytical calculations , we present the results of simplified numerical solutions for the three dimensional smectic structure , which explore relaxation of the smectic layers away from our constructions .",
    "in section  [ sec : largecore ] we present a new construction for filling space based on uniform layer spacing away from a minimal surface .",
    "first we derive formulae for the evolution of curvature fields in layered space and then we employ the weierstra  analytic representation of minimal surfaces to calculate the energies for our proposed phase .",
    "we complete our description by calculating the core energy and argue that tilt - grain boundaries form at the cores of our structures .",
    "numerics are also presented for this construction .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : xray ] we calculate the fourier transform of the smectic density and compare it with experimental x - ray results . in appendix",
    "a we derive curvature evolution equations in curved space and in appendix b we review the weirstra  representation for completeness .",
    "the similarity between the crystal structures and phase diagrams of the nematic and smectic blue phases suggests that , like the nematic blue phases , the smectic phases are stabilized through saddle - splay .",
    "the key to our construction is the observation that saddle - splay and gaussian curvature are identical  @xcite for layered systems with uniform spacing .",
    "the saddle - splay energy of a unit director field @xmath8 is  @xcite @xmath9 , \\label{eq : ssd}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a frank constant . in a layered system , we can rewrite the expression for @xmath10 in a more useful form by employing a local coordinate system where one direction is parallel to the local layer normal , @xmath8 .",
    "this frame is appropriate in the limit where the nematic director and the layer normal are locked .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssd ] ) becomes @xmath11 where @xmath3 is the lagrangian coordinate which labels the layers , @xmath12 is the local layer spacing at @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the gaussian curvature of the @xmath15 surface , and @xmath16 is the determinant of the two - dimensional , induced , surface metric . in the special case that @xmath12 is constant , the integral becomes purely topological :",
    "a consequence of the gauss - bonnet theorem  @xcite is that for a surface of genus @xmath17 the integrated gaussian curvature is @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath19 for any infinite surface  @xcite , @xmath10 is large and negative when @xmath20 and the unit cells contain surfaces with large genus , _",
    "i.e. _ many handles and holes .",
    "note that here , the saddle - splay is a measure of the layer normals and not the nematic director .",
    "when the nematic director follows the layer normal these are , of course , equivalent .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , in type - ii smectics it is possible for the saddle - splay of the director field to differ in its precise numerical value from the saddle - splay in the layers .",
    "in addition to the saddle - splay , we must include the rotationally invariant bulk free energy : @xmath21 ^ 2 + 2 k_1 h^2\\right\\}\\ ] ] where the smectic density is @xmath22 , @xmath23 is a phase field , @xmath24 is the layer spacing , @xmath25 is the compression modulus , @xmath26 is the bend modulus , and @xmath27 is the mean curvature of the layers . if the two principle curvatures are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31  @xcite .    together ,",
    "( [ eq : ssad ] ) and ( [ eq : smfe ] ) favor configurations with uniform layer spacing , low mean curvature and high gaussian curvature",
    ". however , there is an unavoidable geometric frustration between these three terms .",
    "when a surface is displaced along its normal by @xmath32 , the changes in the metric and curvature tensors are  @xcite : @xmath33 it is straightforward to find the variation in the mean and gaussian curvatures : @xmath34 \\delta a - \\frac{1}{2 } g^{ij } \\nabla_i \\nabla_j   \\delta a \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\delta k_g & = & -2k_g h \\delta a -   \\tilde{\\kappa}^{ij }   \\nabla_i \\nabla_j \\delta a. \\label{eq : deltacurv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the covariant derivative on the surface and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the completely antisymmetric tensor .",
    "if we impose smectic order , then @xmath38 may also be interpreted as the normal distance between adjacent layers .",
    "when the spacing is uniform , @xmath39 is constant and @xmath40 . in this case , the first result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltacurv ] ) implies @xmath41 if and only if the principal curvatures @xmath42 satisfy @xmath43 _ i.e. _ @xmath44 . thus if @xmath45 and the layer spacing is uniform , then @xmath46 ; gaussian curvature leads to mean curvature .    for uniform spacing",
    "the evolution equations become particularly simple .",
    "the variation @xmath32 is constant and the equations can be integrated : @xmath47 alternatively , this evolution follows from the observation that if the principle radii of curvature are @xmath48 and @xmath49 for one surface then the radii for the surface displaced by @xmath38 along the local normal are @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in layered systems , gaussian curvature in one region implies mean curvature in another .",
    "furthermore , as we continue to develop the initial layer , there will be a curvature singularity at a distance @xmath51 normal to the original surface , _ i.e. _ at one of the radii of curvature .    with these geometric constraints in mind ,",
    "we construct a solution which strikes a promising balance between mean and gaussian curvatures .",
    "to do this , we build the smectic order by adding layers on top of a triply - periodic minimal surface . by starting with a minimal surface , we bias our structures to have a low total mean curvature energy . in  @xcite , we based our construction on the schwartz p  surface , pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfaces](a ) . in this paper",
    ", we present calculations for both the p  surface and schoen s i - wp  surface , pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfaces](b ) , a surface with a larger genus and thus a lower saddle - splay energy .",
    "the p  surface is an archetypal triply - periodic minimal surface and will provide a basis of comparison with earlier results , while the i - wp  surface shares the symmetries of experimental @xmath52 systems  @xcite ; the latter will also prove to be more stable than the p  surface .",
    "we will consider two variations of this construction : in the first we will allow the layer spacing to vary , while in the second we do not .",
    "in the former we find that the cores are composed of topological line defects , while in the latter we find that domain walls form in the relatively larger cores .",
    "in this section we consider space - filling , layered structures in which each layer is continuous and every layer has the same global topology .",
    "we begin with a minimal surface and devise an explicit construction for filling the region away from that surface .",
    "we note that our bulk phase must contain line defects , since at some point the curvature will diverge , as is implied by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : curvvsa ] ) . by design",
    ", the layers immediately surrounding these line defects will have the same topology as the original surface .",
    "therefore , the next logical step in our construction is to guess the optimal line defect structure .    besides selecting the correct topology",
    ", we should choose a defect complexion that minimizes the compression energy in the region between the minimal surface and the defects : it should , as much as possible , be equidistant from the minimal surface at each point .",
    "thus , an _",
    "ansatz _ for the optimal structure is generated by uniformly translating the minimal surface along its normal until it self - intersects , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : skeleton ] .",
    "the line defects will be disclinations of charge @xmath53 or @xmath54 . in the case of charge",
    "@xmath53 disclinations the layers immediately surrounding them are tight cylinders . from fig .",
    "[ fig : skeleton](a ) , we see that the defects in the p  surface are all @xmath53 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : skeleton](b ) and ( c ) , we see that the defects inside the i - wp surface should have charge @xmath53 , but that outside , the translated layer approaches itself in a plane rather than on a line and so the disclination charge is @xmath54 .",
    "[ fig : skeleton](d ) and ( e ) show our proposed defect structures .",
    "for the defect structure outside the i - wp surface , the location of the intersection of defect lines is a variable chosen to minimize the total compression energy .",
    "it should be noted that in the case where all defects happen to be charge @xmath53 , our requirements of topology and equal spacing are exactly those best satisfied by the skeletal graph of the minimal surface  @xcite .",
    "we take the core region around the defect lines to have a radius of order @xmath24 , the smectic layer spacing .",
    "we model the core as a melted region of smectic with a free energy arising from the condensation energy .",
    "finally , we fill the region between minimal surface and defects with continuous layers .",
    "we desire to have as little mean curvature as possible in this region , so we fill the region with dilated copies of the original minimal surface . in order to do this , we must cut the continuous minimal surface into smaller patches : we cut the surface along lines where one surface tangent is parallel to the line defect structure , and dilate it so that it shrinks onto the vertices where defect lines meet .",
    "the separated minimal patches are connected together by cylindrical patches parallel to the line defects .",
    "when there are disclinations , we must also add some flat patches to complete the surfaces .",
    "thus the surface tangents are continuous everywhere , and the intermediary structures transform smoothly from the minimal surface on the outside to a set of cylinders surrounding line defects on the inside .",
    "this construction fills space completely , at the expense of uniform spacing .",
    "moreover , we have filled a large part of space with minimal surfaces and so the curvature energy is likely to be as small as possible , given the necessary curvature defects .",
    "[ fig : smallcore ] shows how this construction works for the p and i - wp surfaces . for the p surface it is particularly simple ; its construction is show in fig .",
    "[ fig : smallcore](a ) .",
    "the line defects are along the edges of the unit cell and through the center parallel to the edges .",
    "the inside of the p  surface is filled with dilated copies of the p  surface repeat unit , cut at its intersection with the walls of the unit cell .",
    "the edges of the dilated p  surface copies are connected to neighboring cells with cylinders .",
    "the outside of the p  surface is a translated copy of the inside .",
    "the i - wp surface is more complicated , requiring different constructions for outside and inside as well as having both @xmath53 and @xmath54 defects .",
    "[ fig : smallcore](b ) illustrates the construction inside the i - wp  surface : the minimal surface is divided at cuts that can be smoothly attached to cylinders , then dilated towards either the center or corners of the unit cell .",

    "the first column gives the topological genus per unit cell of the structure .",
    "@xmath61 is the total curvature energy , @xmath62 is the saddle - splay , @xmath63 is energy of the defect cores , and @xmath64 is the total compression energy . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     all that remains is to find the optimal way to fill the  core \" volumes for @xmath65 .",
    "the shape of these regions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : skeleton](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) . in the core ,",
    "the continuation of uniform layer spacing from the minimal surface leads to curvature singularities and layer self intersections .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : skeleton](a ) , we can fill this volume with uniformly spaced domains of smectic order which intersect each other in tilt grain boundaries . within a domain ,",
    "each point on a given layer is an equal normal distance away from some point on the initial minimal surface .",
    "points on the grain boundaries between domains are an equal normal distance away from at least two different points on the minimal surface , so the grain boundaries occur where the uniform spacing used outside the core would cause layer self - intersection .",
    "we have no general principle of why the singularities in the core region are domain walls instead of , say , focal conic domains ( such as you may find by developing a catenoid ) . for both the p and i - wp surfaces uniform spacing leads to disclination walls , as it probably does for all but highly symmetric surfaces .",
    "thus , with the aim of avoiding layer compression , we choose this solution for the core structure , which should serve as an energetic upper bound .",
    "the energy of the core will arise from the regular curvature and saddle - splay energies within the smectic domains , along with a surface energy at the grain boundaries and a separate line energy in the highly distorted regions where the grain boundaries meet .",
    "a conservation estimate of the energy of a tilt grain boundary is approximately @xmath66 per unit area  @xcite ( assuming a melted wall of thickness @xmath24 at the defect plane ) .",
    "numerically , the total area of grain boundary walls per unit cell in this construction is @xmath67 for the p  surface and @xmath68 for the i - wp  surface ; the corresponding energies are given in table  [ table : weierstrass ] .",
    "the lines at the intersection of grain boundaries are located where the @xmath53 and @xmath54 disclinations were in the small core model of section  [ sec : smallcore ] . around these lines",
    "the director field varies so rapidly that the smectic order should melt completely , leaving a core of radius @xmath69 and line tension @xmath70 .",
    "the mean curvature energy in the smectic domains is relatively small , since the shape of the innermost layers is mapped by eq .",
    "( [ eq : curvvsa ] ) from the region around the umbilics ( flat points ) on the minimal surface .",
    "the inner layers are thus nearly flat .",
    "we found that the curvature energy was negligible by numerical evaluation .",
    "the saddle - splay energy in the core merits special attention .",
    "since the smectic layers in the core are not closed surfaces , our simple topological arguments do not apply .",
    "we could insist on connecting the surface sections together in a natural way across grain boundaries to obtain closed surfaces with the topology of a sphere .",
    "however , these closed surfaces are nearly polygonal , with all the gaussian curvature concentrated at the vertices , or along the lines in three dimensions where the smectic order has melted . thus .",
    "it is natural to assume that the smectic order parameter vanishes in these line - like cores , and the total saddle - splay of the core is nearly zero .    the dominant free energy terms which determine the stability and preferred size of this construction are therefore the bend , saddle - splay and grain - boundary energies .",
    "minimizing these energies in a unit cell of length @xmath71 gives : @xmath72 at this length the phase is stable against the standard , flat smectic when @xmath73 . reading values from table  [ table : weierstrass ] , the minimum for the p surface structure occurs for @xmath74 , while that for the i - wp occurs at @xmath75 . to compare with experiment we set @xmath76 , where @xmath24 is the smectic layer spacing",
    "this requires @xmath77 for the p surface or @xmath78 for the i - wp surface .",
    "thus the i - wp _ ansatz _ should be the stable phase at any value of @xmath7 .",
    "as before , we used conjugate - gradient minimization to explore the possible smectic configurations . in this case",
    "we relaxed the parallel boundary conditions , letting the interface of smectic field and defect line be arbitrary .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : largecoresim ] .",
    "the core region resembles our `` large core '' model , except that the defect walls have disappeared at the expense of greater overall compression .",
    "locally , the core layers look like focal conics around the defect lines .",
    "this result undoubtedly points to configurations close to our model but with lower energy , and most likely stable for even lower values of @xmath79 . due to numerical difficulties , these phases",
    "could only be made stable for large values of @xmath80 , so we could not compare configurations in the region of interest .",

    "_  @xcite found through x - ray diffraction that the cubic @xmath81 phase showed the strongest diffraction along three mutually orthogonal axes .",
    "they also found that the peak wavelength of diffraction decreased away from these special directions . in order to compare our model to their data , we have calculated the expected scattering from a smectic blue phase built by our  large core \" construction . fig .  [",

    "we took the smectic phase to be @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the distance of the sample point normal to the minimal surface .",
    "we chose this number of layers to avoid any commensuration effects . because there are many layers , this was numerically challenging and a higher precision study is needed , such as the study of scattering from triply - periodic minimal surfaces by garstecki and hoyst  @xcite .",
    "for both structures , and we expect for general minimal surface smectics , the fourier peaks were strongest along the umbilics of the minimal surfaces , _",
    "i.e. _ normal to the points at which the surfaces are flat .",
    "the fourier peaks of the i - wp structure are a clear match to the observed x - ray diffraction of @xmath81 .",

    "[ fig : fft](c ) shows , there is no clear deviation in diffraction maximum wavelength as a function of angle ( pansu _ et.al . _ reported a @xmath86 deviation over @xmath87 angle ) .",
    "this indicates the need for further refinement to our model if it is to explain the current data exactly .",
    "the discrepancy in off - peak behavior between our simulations and real data could arise from some relaxation of our proposed structure to better accommodate the competing energies . as we noted in section",
    "[ sec : simulation ] , the numerical relaxation of the i - wp smectic with parallel ( `` small core '' ) boundary conditions does produce the correct off - peak behavior for the diffraction maxima .",

    "therefore @xmath96 and @xmath97    the intrinsic frustration between curvature and uniform layer spacing can be relieved by considering layered systems in curved space , just as double - twist in the classical blue phases can fill the surface of the three - dimensional sphere without defects  @xcite .",
