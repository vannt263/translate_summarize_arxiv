    "the plancherel measure is probability measure defined on the set @xmath5 of irreducible representations @xmath6 of any finite group @xmath7 .",
    "concretely , the measure of a representation @xmath6 is @xmath8 .",
    "it is called plancherel because the fourier transform @xmath9 is an isometry just like in the classical plancherel theorem .    in this paper",
    "we will be dealing with plancherel measures for @xmath10 and their asymptotics as @xmath4 .",
    "the set @xmath11 is labeled by partitions @xmath3 of @xmath1 or , equivalently , by young diagrams with @xmath1 squares .",
    "we denote the plancherel measure by @xmath12 and recall that the dimension @xmath13 is given by several classical formulas such as the hook formula .",
    "logan and shepp @xcite and , independently , vershik and kerov @xcite ( see also the paper @xcite which contains complete proofs of the results announced in @xcite ) discovered the following measure concentration phenomenon for the plancherel measures for @xmath10 as @xmath4 . take a diagram @xmath3 , scale it in both directions by a factor of @xmath14 so that to obtain a shape of unit area , and rotate it by @xmath15 like in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the boundary of this shape is a polygonal line which is thickened in figure [ fig1 ] . in this way the plancherel measure @xmath16 becomes a measure on the space of continuous functions .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that as @xmath4 , this measure converges to the delta measure at the following function @xmath17 whose graph is drawn in figure [ fig2 ] .    the constant 2 in means that the first part of @xmath3 should behave like @xmath18 as @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that @xmath19 in probability ( in @xcite the inequality @xmath20 was obtained ) .",
    "this constant 2 corresponds to the constant 2 in the ulam problem about the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a random permutation ; it was also obtained by different means in @xcite . about the history of the ulam problem",
    "see @xcite and vast literature cited there .",
    "the next term in the asymptotic of the plancherel measure was computed by kerov in @xcite who showed that the plancherel measure behaves like @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the following gaussian random process @xmath23 here @xmath24 are the tchebychef polynomials of the second kind @xmath25 and @xmath26 are independent standard normal variables .",
    "observe that near the endpoints @xmath27 the formula becomes inadequate because the series diverges at the endpoints .",
    "for more information about the behavior of the plancherel typical partition in the bulk of the limit shape the reader is referred to the recent paper @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the plancherel measure near the edges of @xmath28 $ ] has been the subject of intense recent studies and numerical experiments , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it has been conjectured by baik , deift , and johansson that this behavior , suitably scaled , is identical to the behavior of the eigenvalues of a random hermitian matrix near the edge of the wigner semicircle .",
    "more precisely , consider a random @xmath29 matrix @xmath30 such that the real and imaginary parts @xmath31 are independent normal variables with mean 0 and variance @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the eigenvalues of @xmath34 .",
    "introduce the variables @xmath35 @xmath36 then as @xmath4 the @xmath35 s have a limit distribution which was studied in @xcite and other papers .",
    "in particular , the correlation functions of this random point process have determinantal form with the airy kernel , see for example @xcite .",
    "the distributions of individual @xmath35 s were obtained by tracy and widom in @xcite ; they involve certain solutions of the painlev ii equation .",
    "similarly , let @xmath37 be a partition and set ( note the difference with in the exponent of @xmath1 ) @xmath38 baik , deift , and johansson conjectured that the limit distribution of the @xmath39 s exists and coincides with that of the @xmath35 s .",
    "they verified this conjecture for the distribution of @xmath40 and @xmath41 in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , using very advanced analytic methods .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a direct combinatorial proof of proof of the following result .",
    "consider the points @xmath42 as a random measure on @xmath43 with masses 1 placed at the points @xmath39 , @xmath44 .",
    "consider its laplace transform @xmath45 this is a random process on @xmath46 .",
    "define @xmath47 similarly .",
    "denote expectation by angle brackets .",

    "one obtains the following result about the distribution of the individual rows of a plancherel typical partition @xmath3    [ t1 ] in the @xmath4 limit , the joint distribution of @xmath52 is identical to the joint distribution of @xmath53 for any fixed @xmath54 .      in our proof of theorem [ t1 ]",
    "we use the equivalence of two points of view on topological surfaces ( or algebraic curves ) .",
    "one way to think about a surface is to imagine it glued from polygons by identifying sides of polygons in pairs .",
    "such a representation is a combinatorial structure called a _ map _ on a surface . in connection with quantum gravity",
    ", it has been long known that maps are most intimately related to random matrices , see e.  g.  @xcite for an elementary introduction .",
    "another equally classical way of representing a surface is to realize it as a ramified covering the sphere @xmath55 , or in other words , as a riemann surface of an algebraic function of one complex variable .",
    "it is classically known that every problem about the combinatorics of covering has a translation into a problem about permutations which arise as monodromies around the ramification points .",
    "the two sides of have a combinatorial interpretation as asymptotics of certain maps and coverings , respectively .",
    "we produce a correspondence between the two enumeration problems and show that its deviation from being a bijection is negligible in the @xmath4 limit .",
    "the two sides of are also very directly connected to intersection theory on the moduli spaces @xmath56 of genus @xmath57 curves with @xmath58 marked points .",
    "namely , we show in section [ brown ] that our enumeration problem for maps ( or coverings ) is related to kontsevich s combinatorial model @xcite for intersection numbers on @xmath56 by , essentially , a reparametrization .",
    "this reparametrization involves passage times for the standard brownian motion . as a consequence ,",
    "our enumeration asymptotics derived in theorem [ t3 ] , differs from the unique boxed formula of @xcite by replacing the laplace transform variables by their square roots .",
    "it follows that the limit is a close relative of the so called @xmath58-point function for the intersection numbers of the @xmath59-classes on @xmath56 .",
    "this can be used to compute the @xmath58-point function , see @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that both sides of must be certain riemann integral sums for the corresponding integrals over @xmath56 and the only difference between them is that one discretizes @xmath56 using maps and the other  using coverings .    for another application of asymptotics of coverings to evaluation of integrals over certain moduli spaces",
    "see @xcite .",
    "another connection between coverings and moduli spaces was obtained in @xcite .",

    "murphy elements @xcite .",
    "in recent years , they have become all  purpose heavy ",
    "duty technical tools in representation theory of @xmath10 , see for example @xcite .",
    "the observation that in the @xmath4 the spectral measures ( in the regular representation ) of these elements becomes the wigner semicircle was made by p.  biane in @xcite .",
    "the existence of a connection between plancherel measures and random matrices has been actively advocated by s.  kerov , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the simplest evidence of such a connection is the fact that the so called transition distribution for the limit shape @xmath60 coincides with the wigner semicircle .",
    "random matrices also enter the representation theory of symmetric groups via the free probability theory . for a detailed discussion of the interplay between symmetric groups and free probability see the paper @xcite by p.  biane .",
    "our results explain , at least to some extend , this connection .",
    "an analytic proof of the baik ",
    "johansson conjecture was found subsequently in @xcite and , independently , in @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on an exact formula for the so - called correlation functions of the poissonized plancherel measure .",
    "same formula allows to analyze the local structure of a plancherel typical partition in the bulk of the limit shape , see @xcite .",
    "this exact formula for correlation functions is a special case of the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite were considerably generalized in @xcite .",

    "similar averages were considered by many authors , see especially the recent paper @xcite and references therein .",

    "in this case , there are @xmath65 possible choices of parity of each individual @xmath66 and it is easy to see that by taking a suitable linear combination we can single out the contribution of only maximal eigenvalues .",

    "this corresponds to our convention ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) on where we transfer the length of a collapsing edge .",
    "however , a simple shift as in figure [ fig9 ]    which reduces the length of both boundaries by 1 , takes care of this inconvenience .",
    "now it clear that to obtain a ribbon graph like in figure [ fig9 ] one just takes any map from @xmath176 and calls the first @xmath177 sides the upper boundary , and rest  the lower boundary .",

    "the nonspecial sheets naturally glue together at the points which cover @xmath436 to form a ribbon graph whose edges are the 2-valent sheets and vertices are either the sheets of valence @xmath159 or multivalent junctions ( like in figure [ fig20 ] ) of 2-valent sheets .",

    "for example , the boundary in figure [ fig16 ] is 3 units longer than the boundary in figure [ fig15 ] .",
    "note that collapsing the covering discussed in section [ cox ] and shown in figure [ fig15b ] produces , essentially , the map on torus shown in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "more precisely , every edge of this map has length 2 instead of @xmath140 , so the torus is really glued from a 12-on , not from a hexagon .    as another example , consider the equation @xmath445 which defines a @xmath229-fold covering of the sphere of genus @xmath229 with @xmath140 special and @xmath140 nonspecial sheet , both @xmath446-valent .",

    ", the arrow in figure [ fig16 ] shows the order of visiting the corners of the trivalent vertex ( which is left ) . in another example , the graph from figures [ ( 12)6 ] and [ genus2 ] has one 6-valent left vertex and two 3-valent right vertices .",
    "_ by construction , all marked vertices come from some points which cover @xmath436 and , therefore , they are right vertices .",
    "let us show that they also must be interior vertices .",
    "this follows from inspection of figure [ fig16c ] .",
    "the figure [ fig16c ] shows the marked vertex ( the bottom one ) of the special sheet from figure [ fig15a ] .",
    "since the whole alphabet must go once around @xmath436 the points marked by question marks in figure [ fig16c ] can not be points from @xmath455 .",
    "on the other hand , the points @xmath455 are precisely the ramification points which _ do not _ lie on the boundary of our special sheet .",
    "therefore , all points marked by question marks do lie on the boundary of our special sheet .",
    "it follows that all corners in figure [ fig16c ] come come from one and the same special sheet .",
    "an algebraic equivalent of this geometric argument is the following .",
    "let @xmath389 be a solution of . then @xmath456 must fix @xmath140 because @xmath140 is clearly fixed by the rest of the product in .",
    "this translates into figure [ fig16c ] .",
    "now consider some vertex @xmath447 of our map .",
    "if @xmath447 is a right vertex ( in particular , if @xmath449 ) then the structure of the corresponding jm covering at @xmath447 can be reconstructed uniquely from the fact that @xmath447 covers @xmath436 and there is no ramification at @xmath436 .",
    "( in other words , all letters of the alphabet have to occur once clockwise around @xmath447 ) .      when we encounter a left vertex ( such as the vertex with the arrow in figure [ fig16 ] ) then we insert a nonspecial sheet of valence @xmath448 .",
    "the result looks like figure [ fig14 ] .",
    "one should notice that this operation reduces the number of edges by @xmath448 and we have to relabel the edges if we want a consecutive alphabetical labeling .",
    "also notice that we have to use the third condition in the statement of the proposition for this reconstruction .",
    "this finishes the reconstruction of nonspecial sheets . as to the special sheets ,",
    "let us examine the figure [ fig16c ] .",
    "if the edges of a cell of a map are labeled by @xmath460 and its initial vertex is an interior right vertex then there is room to fit in the rest of the alphabet as in figure [ fig16c ] .",
    "this concludes the proof .      consider the case @xmath98 and @xmath133 .",
    "the equation implies that in this case @xmath461 and hence there are no nonspecial sheets of valence @xmath462 .",
    "therefore the map @xmath170 is a bijection between the sets @xmath463 and @xmath464 .",
    "the algebraic translation of this geometric fact is the following .",
    "let @xmath465 be the solution of corresponding to our covering .",
    "by the condition @xmath98 , @xmath133 implies that @xmath466 and since every @xmath467 has to appear at least twice , this is equivalent to saying that there are precisely @xmath468 pairs of equal numbers among the numbers @xmath469 .",
    "the bijection @xmath170 between @xmath463 and @xmath464 and the example in section [ scat ] now mean that is satisfied if and only if the the corresponding pairing is noncrossing .",
    "this observation is due to p.  biane @xcite .",
    "intoduce the following subsets in @xmath194 , where as usual , we use the abbreviation @xmath472 denote by @xmath473 the set of those maps which after contraction @xmath155 have only trivalent vertices . since only trivalent graphs @xmath162 contribute to , we know that @xmath474 by definition , set @xmath475 that is , @xmath476 is the subset of @xmath477 formed by maps satisfying the conditions of proposition [ p5 ] .",
    "it is the image under @xmath170 of jm coverings with nonspecial sheets of valence at most @xmath478 .",
    "once proposition [ p6 ] is established , the theorem [ t4 ] will follow . indeed , since @xmath170 is one - to - one , then because of and it suffices to consider coverings with only @xmath480-valent nonspecial sheets .",
    "for such a covering , the number of 3-valent sheets equals @xmath481 . collapsing a trivalent sheet to its middle increases the length of the boundary by 3 .",
    "therefore , in total , the boundary of the corresponding map is @xmath482 longer .",
    "since this precisely compensates the exponent in , we obtain : @xmath483    we also point out that proposition [ p5 ] gives an upper bound on @xmath484 which results in an analog of the estimate for the right - hand side of . indeed , the mapping @xmath170 is one - to - one and increases the total perimeter of the boundary by at most @xmath482 .",
    "from we have @xmath485 , so the total increase is by at most a multiple of @xmath64 with implies that the right - hand side of is again bounded by some function of the @xmath125 s .",
    "let @xmath487 be a marked vertex of a map with @xmath99 polygons .",
    "suppose that @xmath487 is an interior vertex .",
    "follow the edges of the corresponding polygon in the counterclockwise direction until we reach a vertex @xmath447 which is not interior . by analogy with the flow of a river ,",
    "we call the vertex @xmath447 a _ mouth _ vertex , see figure [ fig22b ] . observe that a mouth vertex is _",
    "never right_.    also , call a vertex @xmath447 of a map _ contractible _ if it disappears after contraction of all @xmath167-valent vertices ; otherwise , call it _",
    "incontractible_. observe that a contractible vertex is always right unless it is a mouth vertex .",
    "_ first , the condition that the marked vertices must be right is asymptotically negligible . indeed , all but finitely many vertices are right and the chances to hit one them with a mark go to 1 as the perimeter goes to infinity .",
    "similarly , the third condition in proposition [ p5 ] does not affect the asymptotics .",
    "the possible combinatorial configurations of the incontractible and mouth vertices of maps in @xmath477 are described by ribbon graphs @xmath488 together with the choice of an edge @xmath489 , @xmath490 , on the boundary of any cell of @xmath162 .",
    "the edge @xmath491 is the first edge we reach if we start from the marked vertex of the @xmath126-th cell of the map .",
    "we shall see that , for any configuration , the proportion of maps lying in @xmath486 equals @xmath492 , and that the same portion of maps lies in @xmath453 .",
    "this number is , in fact , a product of factors @xmath493 over the @xmath494 vertices @xmath447 that are not right .",
    "let us examine such vertices @xmath447 .",
    "we claim that for such a vertex being left is equivalent to being trivalent . indeed , suppose @xmath447 is left and not trivalent .",
    "then , as we go around any nonempty tree in any of the trees shown in figure [ fig23 ] , we go from one corner of @xmath447 to the next corner in the clockwise direction .",
    "since @xmath447 is left , this is impossible .",
    "it follows from the discussion in sections [ sfor ] or [ brown ] that the removal of any given tree comes at the price of the factor @xmath233 in the asymptotics . in terms of the random",
    "walk , for example , it means that the first step of the walk has to go up , which is an event of probability @xmath233 .",
    "therefore , asymptotically @xmath495 of maps are trivalent at @xmath447 or , equivalently , @xmath447 is a left ( or trivalent ) vertex for about @xmath495 of all maps .",
    "now suppose that @xmath447 is a contractible mouth vertex , such as the one shown in figure [ fig22b ] .",
    "we may assume that @xmath447 does not coincide with any other mouth vertex because the chances of such a coincidence vanish as the perimeter of the map goes to infinity .",
    "for general maps , multiple branches may go up or no branches at all ( which happens if the marked vertex is not interior ) .",
    "therefore , the insertion of this shaded branch and chopping down the tree at the bottom takes arbitrary maps to maps such that @xmath447 is a trivalent mouth vertex and the corresponding marked vertex is interior . the insertion of the shaded branch increases the perimeter by @xmath229 .",
    "this means that @xmath496 of maps have it .",
    "this times @xmath233 for the forbidden tree gives us the total of @xmath495 of maps belonging to @xmath486 .",
    "either way , we get a factor of @xmath493 for any trivalent left vertex .",
    "the number of such vertices can be easily computed .",
    "all of them become trivalent nonspecial sheets of the corresponding jm covering . therefore , by there are @xmath481 of them .",
    "this proves and and concludes the proof of proposition [ p6 ] and , hence , of theorem [ t1 ] .",

    "the relations of coxeter type ( which produce coverings of genus 1 ) @xmath497 start playing role in the enumeration of @xmath498 .",
    "every covering in @xmath498 has either two 3-valent special sheets or , else , one of valence 4 .",
