    "what is secure direct communication ? traditionally , secure communication schemes based on quantum mechanics are _ non - deterministic _",
    "@xcite : alice , the sender , can not determine which bit value bob receives through the secure quantum channel .",
    "such non - deterministic communication can be used to establish a _ secret key _ between alice and bob .",
    "whenever an eavesdropper tries to extract information from the quantum channel , he influences the transmitted state and can be detected with some probability .",
    "if alice and bob are virtually sure that a certain random subsequence of bits has been transmitted secretely , alice can use the remaining subsequence as a shared secret key to encrypt her message , send the encrypted message to bob through a non - secret channel and then bob uses the shared key to decrypt the message .",
    "it is a common belief that every secure quantum communication protocol should work that way .",
    "recently , however , a _ deterministic _",
    "quantum cryptographic protocol has been presented @xcite , which i will refer to as the _ bekw protocol_. against the paradigm of quantum cryptography , the information is sent _ directly _ from alice to bob .",
    "alice uses a secret key to encrypt her message before sending it through a quantum channel .",
    "if she is virtually sure that no eavesdropper was in the line , alice publishes the secret key so bob can read the message .",
    "this is a different concept of quantum cryptography , and i will refer to it as _ secure direct communication _ as opposed to _",
    "quantum key distribution_. in the present paper , another deterministic cryptographic scheme is presented which has significant advantages against other schemes :    1 .   high quantum efficiency : 1 bit per qubit .",
    "2 .   reliable security : detection probability @xmath0 per control qubit .",
    "3 .   deterministic : no qubits are discarded .",
    "the message is send directly .",
    "the magic ingredient for the protocol is entanglement .",
    "alice has to prepare and measure bell pairs , and she must be able to store one of the entangled qubits for a certain time ( some milliseconds will do ) . even if it might still be difficult to prepare and to measure the bell states , and in particular to store entangled qubits , the presented scheme contains a completely new approach to assure the security of a communication . in order to illustrate the quality of the protocol , let us compare it with other schemes . in non - deterministic protocols , alice and bob choose at random one of several possible bases to prepare and/or to measure the transmitted qubit .",
    "if their choices does not coincide , the qubit is discarded since the outcome is completely uncorrelated . in the bb84 protocol @xcite every second qubit",
    "is discarded that way , so the quantum transmission rate , @xmath1 is @xmath2 .",
    "the protocol needs an additional classical channel carrying 2 bits per transmission ( the choices of basis ) , so the total rate @xmath3 is @xmath4 .",
    "since the usable bits form the shared secret key , there is still the need for a subsequent classical transfer of the same bit size carrying the message information .",
    "the same goes for the ekert scheme @xcite . in the bekw protocol",
    ", every transmitted qubit can directly be used for the message , but only two of them carry one message bit , so @xmath2 . the additional classical channel carries 2 bits per transmission , so @xmath5 . in the protocol presented here , two qubits and 2 bits of message information are transmitted , hence @xmath6 .",
    "the classical channel transfers 2 bits , so @xmath7 . no further transmission is required .",
    "all the rates given above do not include _",
    "control bits_. so let us roughly compare the security of the protocols , which depends on the detection probability @xmath8 per transmitted control qubit .",
    "the bb84 and the ekert protocol provide @xmath0 , the bekw protocol provides @xmath9 , and the protocol presented here provides @xmath0 .",
    "let us start with a protocol that is not designed for security but for highly efficient use of quantum resources .",
    "afterwards we will construct from there the secure protocol .",
    "alice controls a device that is able to prepare two qubits in one of the bell states @xmath10 forming the orthogonal bell basis @xmath11 .",
    "let us bring the bell states in some order , @xmath12 alice decides to send the value @xmath13 by preparing the _ initial state _",
    "@xmath14 , which she can easily look up in fig .",
    "[ alicescheme ] .",
    "after the state is prepared , alice sends only the _ second _ qubit , which we call the _ travel qubit _ , and she keeps the first one , which we call the _",
    "home qubit_. bob receives the travel qubit and performs one of the four unitary operations @xmath15 forming the set @xmath16 .",
    "these matrices are unitary and hermitian at the same time , so each one is its own inverse , @xmath17 , and although they are _ local _ operations , they switch between the _ non - local _ bell states in the following manner : @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we have neglected the irrelevant global phase on the righthand side .",
    "bob receives the travel qubit from alice and encodes @xmath21 by performing @xmath22 on it .",
    "after that , he sends the travel qubit back to alice .",
    "alice then performs a bell measurement on both qubits resulting in one of the four bell states .",
    "let us call this resulting state the _ final state _ @xmath23 .",
    "since she knows the state @xmath24 she initially prepared , she now also knows the operation @xmath22 bob has performed by solving @xmath25 since there are 4 possible operations _ intentionally _ performed by bob , alice has received 2 bits of _ deterministic information _ from him .",
    "if she now tells bob via a classical channel the final bell state @xmath26 resulting from her measurement , then bob can calculate the initial state @xmath24 by inverting  ( [ alicecalc ] ) .",
    "since there are 4 possible initial bell states that alice intentionally prepared , bob has received 2 bits of deterministic information from her . instead calculating , alice and bob can also look at the transformation table in fig .",
    "[ trafotable ] to decode the other one s message .",
    "the table indicates the effect of the local operations @xmath22 to the bell state .",
    "for example , @xmath27 transforms @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "not indicated is the effect of @xmath30 , which does nothing .",
    "the transmission scheme is depicted in fig .",
    "[ ab ] .",
    "the efficiency of this protocol is high : 1 qubit travels forth and back between alice and bob and 4 bits of information are exchanged , which makes a quantum transmission rate of 2 bits per transmitted qubit .",
    "the origin of such high efficiency is the same as in the _ dense coding _",
    "protocol @xcite : entanglement .",
    "the present protocol works in a similiar manner and since it works in two directions simultaneously , let us call it a _ double dense coding _ protocol .",
    "say there is eavesdropper eve having full access to the quantum channels between alice and bob .",
    "whatever measurement eve might be performing , the travel qubit carries no information about the initial state prepared by alice , because the state of the travel qubit equals for _ any _ initial bell state the complete mixture , @xmath31 however , eve can gain some information about _ bob s _ message .",
    "if eve measures the travel qubit coming from alice in some basis , resends it in a certain state , and then measures the state of the qubit returned by bob , she can gain 1 bit of information about the action that was performed on the qubit .",
    "such an attack is called _",
    "intercept - resend attack_.    but eve is _ really _ smart .",
    "she captures the qubit as it travels from alice to bob .",
    "then she prepares another `` evil '' bell state @xmath32 , sends one of its qubits as a travel qubit to bob , who performs his operation and sends it back to alice . but",
    "eve also catches that qubit and performs a bell measurement on both evil qubits .",
    "now she knows exactly the operation @xmath22 that bob has performed and hence got his message .",
    "she applies the operation @xmath22 to the captured `` friendly '' travel qubit and sends it back to alice , who performs a bell measurement resulting in the final state @xmath26 .",
    "when alice announces the final state @xmath26 , eve can calculate the initial state @xmath24 and hence got alice s message .",
    "bob performs the same calculation and also obtains @xmath24 .",
    "so even if alice and bob would sacrifice their bits to compare them publicly , they would not notice that eve was in the line .",
    "to alice eve acts like bob and to bob eve acts like alice .",
    "such an evil thing is called a _ man - in - the - middle attack _ and is depicted in fig .",
    "[ aebcapture ] .",
    "there is no protection against a man - in - the - middle attack except : a _",
    "public channel_. this is a channel that spreads its information content all over the world .",
    "eve can read and write to the channel , but she can not _ manipulate _ it . if even the public channel is under full control of eve , then let us call this a _",
    "strong _ man - in - the - middle attack or a _",
    "berlusconi attack_. the protocol presented here is secure against _ weak _ man - in - the - middle attacks : it does not allow eve to manipulate the public channel . a fairly good public channel is already given by an ordinary radio signal .",
    "apart from _ active attacks _ described above , there can also be _ passive attacks_. once the final state @xmath26 is published , the messages of alice and bob are strongly correlated via  ( [ alicecalc ] ) .",
    "an eavesdropper could try a so - called _ known plaintext attack _ :",
    "if there is some part of alice s or bob s message that is likely to appear in the message at a certain position ( e.g. `` hi baby '' or `` see you '' ) , the eavesdropper can _ immediately _ decypher the other one s part of the message at the same position .",
    "no serious cryptosystem should allow that .",
    "first we abandon the `` full duplex '' property of the double dense coding scheme and allow only alice to send messages to bob .",
    "bob uses a random number generator to choose the operation @xmath22 he performs on the travel qubit .",
    "bob s random sequence of operations acts like a secret key on alice s message .",
    "next we have to make sure that eve is detected with nonzero probability while she is trying to do active attacks .",
    "let us introduce two modes , the _ message mode _ and the _ control mode_. in message mode , alice and bob perform the double dense coding protocol , but alice does not tell the final state she has measured . with probability @xmath33 bob switches from message mode to control mode .",
    "now , instead of performing his operation , bob randomly chooses a basis @xmath34 out of the two bases @xmath35 or @xmath36 , where @xmath37 he performs a _ measurement _ in the basis @xmath34 on the travel qubit and instead returning alice the travel qubit , bob sends her his choice of basis and his measurement result through the public channel .",
    "now alice also switches to control mode and performs a measurement in the same basis on her home qubit .",
    "then she looks if the result is correlated or anticorrelated to bob s result . since she ( and only she ) knows the initial state @xmath38 , she sees if the correlation is wrong or right .",
    "if the correlation is wrong , she knows that someone was in the line and stops the communication .",
    "if the correlation is correct , she repeats the preceding run in message mode because the last qubit she sent has been sacrificed .    at the end of an undisturbed communication sequence",
    ", alice sends bob the list of final bell states she has measured . since bob knows the sequence of operations he performed , he can decypher alice s messages by solving  ( [ alicecalc ] ) or using fig .",
