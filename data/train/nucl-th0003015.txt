    "the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements takes place by radiative capture of neutrons ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 process ) and protons ( @xmath5 process ) in competition with beta decay . in the statistical regime ,",
    "neutron and proton capture rates are proportional to the level density of the corresponding compound nucleus @xcite .",
    "most theoretical models of level densities are based on the fermi gas model , e.g. , the bethe formula @xcite , which describes the exponential increase of the many - particle level density with both excitation energy and mass number . in the backshifted bethe formula ( bbf ) ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , shell corrections and two - body correlations are taken into account empirically by introducing a backshift @xmath2 of the ground state energy .",
    "the bbf offers a good description of the experimentally determined level densities when both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are fitted for each nucleus @xcite .",
    "the overall systematics of @xmath1 and @xmath2 were studied empirically but it is difficult to accurately predict these parameters for a particular nucleus .",
    "the interacting shell model takes into account both shell effects and residual interactions and constitutes an attractive framework for calculating accurate level densities . however , conventional diagonalization methods are limited by the size of the model space .",
    "full major shell calculations are presently restricted to nuclei with @xmath6 ( in the @xmath7-shell ) @xcite .",
    "the development of quantum shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) methods @xcite allows the calculation of finite and zero - temperature observables in model spaces orders of magnitude larger than those that can be treated by conventional diagonalization techniques .",
    "recently the smmc method was successfully adapted to the microscopic calculations of nuclear level densities @xcite .",
    "the applications of fermionic monte carlo methods are often limited by the so - called sign problem , which causes a breakdown of the method at low temperatures .",
    "a practical solution was developed in the nuclear case @xcite , but the resulting extrapolation errors were found to be too large for accurate calculations of level densities .",
    "instead we have constructed good - sign interactions that include the dominating collective components of effective nuclear interactions @xcite and were proven to be realistic for the calculation of level densities .",
    "the smmc method is based on a representation of the many - body imaginary - time propagator as a functional integral over one - body propagators in fluctuating auxiliary fields , known as the hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite .",
    "the many - dimensional integration is then performed by monte carlo .",
    "the smmc method is computationally intensive . in particular ,",
    "level density calculations require computation of the thermal energy at all temperatures .",
    "if this procedure is to be repeated for a series of nuclei , the calculations quickly become very time - consuming .",
    "recently we introduced a novel particle - number reprojection method @xcite with which we can calculate nuclear observables for a series of nuclei using the monte carlo sampling for a single nucleus .",
    "the weight function used in the sampling is proportional to the partition function of a fixed even - even or @xmath8 nucleus .",
