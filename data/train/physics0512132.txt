    "expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm is a statistical method for parameter estimation from incomplete observations . it is an extension of the maximum likelihood ( ml ) method well known to physicists .",
    "this method was first proposed by a. dempster etc in @xcite . since its introduction",
    ", this method has been used in a wide varieties of applications such as signal processing , medical image processing and genetics , to name a few ( @xcite ) .",
    "the em method is well suited to handle problems with observations diluted by large amount of noise , since it is not known a priori a observation is signal or noise .",
    "that is why it is introduced into high energy physics for track reconstruction in the atlas detector at lhc ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the presence of track noise ,",
    "the em based tracking algorithm can obtain a track resolution more than two order of magnitude better than traditional least square tracking method .",
    "we have used the em method in the spectrometer calibration for hks experiment at jefferson lab .",
    "jefferson lab hks experiment aims at obtaining high resolution hypernuclear spectroscopy by ( e , ek ) reaction . to achieve this goal",
    ", it is essential to perform a proper spectrometer calibration to optimize the reconstruction resolution of the momentum and angles of scattering electrons and kaons ( @xcite ) .",
    "the only high precision calibration method is to make use of the known masses of @xmath0,@xmath1 hyperons produced from hydrogen in ch@xmath2 target and the narrow width of @xmath3b hypernuclear ground state from @xmath4c target(@xcite ) .",
    "these masses can be produced at the same spectrometer kinematics as the production of hypernuclei .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the set of parameters which defines the reconstruction function .",
    "for example , the @xmath5 can be a set of polynomial coefficients in the polynomial expansion of reconstruction function .",
    "the task of calibration now is to find the best set of parameters @xmath5 to optimize the reconstruction resolution .",
    "the missing mass @xmath6 of ( e , ek ) reaction can be calculated from the focal plane measurement @xmath7 , @xmath8 denotes each event number , and the reconstruction parameters @xmath5 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a nonlinear function .",
    "the format of @xmath10 can be derived from the kinematics equations . @xmath11",
    "represent the trajectories of the particles at spectrometer focal plane .",
    "let @xmath12 be the difference between the calculated mass and the known mass value from particle data book @xmath13 , @xmath14 finally , we define a chisquare as the weighted sum of squared @xmath12 over all events : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the relative weights of @xmath0,@xmath17 and @xmath3b gs events .",
    "the set of parameters @xmath5 which minimize the chisquare function will define our optimized reconstruction function .",
    "this is a typical nonlinear least square ( nls ) problem .",
    "the chisquare function is still a complex nonlinear function and have to be minimized by numerical method .",
    "it is carried out by using cernlib fortran program package leamax ( @xcite ) .    in case",
    "we have a clean signal of hyperons and hypernuclear bound states ( the signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio better than 6:1 ) , the nls method works well , as is shown for simulated hks data in our arxiv paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the hks spectrometer setup detects very forward angle e and kaons in order to increase hypernuclear yield .",
    "thus in real experiment , we see high accidental background between kaon arm and electrons produced by bremsstrahlung photons . for the real data ,",
    "the s / n ratio in the missing mass spectrum is almost 1:1 ( fig.[fig : c12 ] ) . applying the nls method to the data results in wrong calibration . as shown in fig.[fig : nls ] , the accidental background under the @xmath3b gs peak , which should be flat , now forms an artificial `` bump '' as a result of the nls calibration . clearly , the em algorithm which is robust to noise observations should be used for the spectrometer calibration of hks .    b excitation energy spectrum .",
    "the shaded region is accidental backgroud.,width=453 ]    b missing mass spectrum used in the improper calibration of hks spectrometer by nonlinear least square method .",
    "the shaded region is accidental backgroud.,width=453 ]",
    "we have two condiderations in order to implement the em method :    1 .",
    "em method is used for parameter estimation with incomplete observation . taking advantage of this feature",
    ", we can define a variable @xmath18 , which denotes whether event @xmath8 is a real signal ( real coincidence ) : @xmath19 or noise ( accidental coincidence ) : @xmath20 , although @xmath21 can not be observed by the spectrometer .",
    "thus instead of minimize the chisquare in eq.[eq : chis ] , we will minimize an energy function defined as @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a cut off paramter .",
    "2 .   there is a large number of parameters in the parameter set @xmath5 , to aviod the calibration process ending up in a local minimum , we introduce an annealing process ( @xcite ) .",
    "one requires each configuration of the system with energy @xmath24 obey the bolzmann distribution at temperature @xmath25 .",
    "one then minimizes the expectation value of the energy function at successively lower temperatures until final result at @xmath26 .",
    "+ according to bolzmann distribution , the probability for the system to have configuration @xmath27 , is : @xmath28 + where @xmath29 is the inverse temperature @xmath30 and z is the partition function : @xmath31    the em algorithm can be divided into the expectation step and the maximization step . in the expectation step ,",
    "the expectaion value of the energy function over the unobserved variable is calculated : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the probability function of assignment variables @xmath21 conditioned on the parameter set @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the marginal probability function : @xmath36 effective energy @xmath37    substitute equations [ eq : prop ] and [ eq : marg ] into equation [ eq : exp ] , we can write up the expectation value as : @xmath38 \\\\ & = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}[\\delta m_i^2 p_i\\prime+\\lambda p_0\\prime ] . \\end { split } \\label { eq : pi}\\ ] ] @xmath39 can be interpreted as the probability that event @xmath8 is a real signal .",
    "the minimization step is then to minimize the @xmath40 function with respect to the parameter set @xmath5 . because the second term is independent of @xmath5 , in the maximization step , we will minimize function : @xmath41 with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath39 is defined by equation [ eq : pi ] .",
    "again , we have added the relative weights @xmath16 to adjust for the effect of @xmath0,@xmath17 and @xmath3b gs events in the calibration .",
    "the new values of the parameter is used to update the probabilities @xmath39 , and the @xmath42 function is again minimized .",
    "comparing with eq.[eq : chis ] , we can see that the em algorithm in this case is nothing but an iteratively reweighted least - square procedure .",
    "the weights or probabilies are not constants now , but functions of @xmath12 or @xmath5 .",
    "example probability functions calculated for the hks spectrometer calibration is shown in fig.[fig : rw ] .",
    "the minimization of function @xmath42 is also carried out by cernlib fortran program package leamax .",
    "we have obtained preliminary reconstruction functions by the em method described above .",
