    "errors , originating in einstein s 1905 special relativity paper  @xcite , in the standard text book interpretation of the physics of the space - time lorentz transformation ( lt ) , have been pointed out in a series of recent papers by the present author  @xcite . in these papers",
    "it is shown that the ` length contraction ' and ` relativity of simultaneity ' effects , derived directly from the lt , are spurious , resulting from a failure to include important additive constants in the equations .",
    "einstein pointed out the necessity to include such constants , to correctly describe synchronised clocks , in ref .",
    "@xcite , but never actually did so himself .",
    "since the demonstration of the spurious nature of the effects is simple , straightforward and brief , it is recalled , for the reader s convenience , in the following section of the present paper .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to a discussion of the physics of the minkowski space - time plot . in his original ` space - time ' paper  @xcite minkowski derived a ` length contraction ' effect from the geometry of the plot without considering directly the lt .",
    "similar derivations are to be found in many text books on special relativity or classical electromagnetism . in section 3 ,",
    "the projective - geometrical properties of the space - time plot are derived from the lt . in section 4 , minkowski s original derivation of ` length contraction ' is reviewed , and shown to result from an erroneous assumption concerning the direction of the world line of the considered , uniformly moving , object . in fact , the world line corresponding to minkowski s choice of @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes is @xmath2 , whereas it is assumed to be @xmath3 and therefore to lie along the @xmath1 axis .",
    "the same mistake is made in all ( with , to the present writer s",
    "best knowledge , a single exception ) text - book treatments of the problem .",
    "some examples are discussed in section 5 .",
    "also discussed in section 5 is the fortuitously correct derivation of time dilatation from the standard , incorrect , minkowski plot , as well as the illusory nature of the ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect suggested by superficial inspection of the plot .",
    "this error is not , as in the case of ` length contraction ' , the result of a trivial geometrical mistake , but arises from a naive interpretation of purely mathematical projection operations on the plot that are unrelated to the basic physics of the problem observation in different inertial frames of events of two spatially - separated and synchronised clocks .",
    "section 6 contains a brief summary .",
    "the lt relates space and time coordinates as measured in two inertial frames in relative motion . in the following",
    ", it is assumed that the frame s moves with velocity @xmath4 relative to s , along the direction of a common @xmath5-@xmath0axis . in particular , the world lines of the origin , o , of s with spatial coordinates @xmath0,@xmath6,@xmath7=0,0,0 and the fixed point , p , with @xmath0,@xmath6,@xmath7 = l,0,0 are considered .",

    "( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) are recovered from ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) when @xmath23 .",
    "it follows from ( 2.8 ) that : @xmath24 l is therefore a constant that is independent of @xmath4 , defined only by the choice of coordinate origin in s. as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , s @xmath27 s and @xmath28 , so that for @xmath29 , ( 2.5 ) is written :",
    "@xmath30 so that @xmath31 it then follows from ( 2.3),(2.4),(2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) that : @xmath32 the spatial separation of p and o is therefore the same in s and s for all values of @xmath33 and @xmath16 there is no ` relativistic length contraction ' effect .    using ( 2.4 ) to eliminate @xmath34 from ( 2.2 ) , and ( 2.8 ) to eliminate @xmath35 from ( 2.6 ) gives the time dilatation ( td ) relations : @xmath36 the clocks at o and p therefore remain synchronised at all times : @xmath37 there is no ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect .",
    "the spurious ` length contraction ' effect as derived from the lt in einstein s 1905 special relativity paper  @xcite , and the associated ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect are the consequence of using , in the present problem , an incorrect lt to describe the world line of p. instead of ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) , the lt ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) , appropriate for o , is used also for p , thus neglecting the additive constants that must be , according to einstein  @xcite , added to the right sides of the latter equations in order to correctly describe a synchronised clock at @xmath38 .",

    "in which @xmath41 , gives @xmath42 events which are simultaneous in s are then not so in s. this is the ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect . how the same spurious effect results from misinterpretation of the minkowski space - time plot is explained below",
    "it is assumed that the lt is used to describe space and time measurements of two objects , o1 and o2 , that are at rest along the @xmath0 axis of the frame s , separated by a distance @xmath43 , o1 being at the origin of s and o2 at @xmath44 . as above , the frame s moves with uniform velocity @xmath4 along the positive @xmath5-axis of the frame s , the @xmath5 and @xmath0 axes being parallel .",

    "it is easily shown that the @xmath51-axis is obtained from the @xmath5-axis by clockwise rotation through the angle @xmath52 , while the @xmath53-axis is obtained from the @xmath54-axis by anti - clockwise rotation through the same angle .",

    "indeed , simple inspection of fig.3 shows that that the absence of any length contraction or relativity of simultaneity effect is a necessary consequence of translational invariance the world line wl2 being obtained from wl1 by the spatial coordinate substitution @xmath106 ( compare eqns(3.12 ) and ( 3.13 ) with ( 3.14 ) and ( 3.15 ) ) .    in fig.4",

    "it is nonsensical to draw on the plots world lines with any other slope .",
    "as will be seen in the following section , just this fundamental error was made by minkowski in his original ` space - time ' paper  @xcite , and has since been universally followed by authors of text books and the pedagogical literature .",

    "@xcite , used by minkowski to derive a ` length contraction ' effect , is drawn in fig.5 . only minkowski s time coordinates @xmath16,@xmath1 are replaced by @xmath54,@xmath73 and , for clarity , the intersection of the line ab the tangent to the hyperbola ao@xmath113 at a with the @xmath54 axis , has been labelled e. minkowski assumes that a , a point on the world line of the orgin of s , lies on the @xmath73 axis , for non - zero values of @xmath73 .",
    "this is wrong . if the world line of the origin of s , as viewed in s , is @xmath114 .",
    "as assumed by minkowski , the @xmath0 , @xmath73 axes must be drawn parallel to the @xmath51 , @xmath53 axes shown in fig.4 above .",
    "the correct world line for the @xmath0 , @xmath73 axes of fig.5a is @xmath115 , as shown in fig.6 .",
    "in fact the hyperbola giving the locus of the coordinates of the origin of s , for different values of @xmath92 , can never cross the @xmath116 axis , as shown in fig.5a .",
    "the lt is not mentioned in minkowski s paper only geometric properties of the hyperbolae which specify time - like or space - like invariant intervals . to calculate coordinates from invariant interval relations square roots",
    "must be taken , leading to sign ambiguities .",
    "insufficient attention to the correct sign choice in correlating world lines with axis directions is at the origin of minkowski s error .",
    "in order to calculate a ` length contraction ' effect minkowski assumed an oblique projection as shown in fig.5b .",
    "thus the length qq of an object lying along the @xmath0 axis corresponds to the length qq along the @xmath5-axis , the lines qq being drawn parallel to the @xmath73 axis . such a projection is seen to result in a length contraction effect of qq as compared to qq. however , the geometry of fig.5b gives : @xmath117 not the conventional length contraction effect which would instead give : @xmath118 .",
    "in order to arrive at the latter result , minkowski makes the following hypotheses connecting the geometries of fig.5a and fig.5b : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the length along the @xmath0 axis of an object at rest in s and observed in s , and uses a different geometrical definition of the length contraction effect .",
    "minkowski s arguments are based on the geometry of fig.5b .",
    "however the axis o@xmath0 in the figure is inconsistent with the world lines pp of the ends of an object at rest in s. for such an object @xmath95 and the @xmath5 and @xmath0 axes coincide . taking the ratio of ( 4.4 ) to ( 4.2 )",
    "gives :    @xmath121    minkowski now assumes that @xmath122 is the length contraction factor .",
    "since the line eab is drawn as a tangent to the hyperbola , it follows that the tangent of the angle aea is @xmath123 and the line segment eab is parallel to the @xmath0 axis . from the symmetry of the figure about the light cone projection obb , the angles aea and cdc are equal .",
    "it then follows from the geometry of fig.5a that @xmath124 giving , with ( 4.5 ) , the relation @xmath125 or @xmath126 .",
    "the argument given attempts to relate the world lines of the ends an object at rest in s , represented by pp , to the world lines , qq , of the ends of an object at rest in s , on the assumption that the @xmath0 axis is as drawn in fig.5a .",
    "this is a incorrect procedure since the axes needed to specify the world line , in the frame s , of an object at rest in the frame s , are not as shown in fig.5b , but as in fig.6 with exchange of primed and unprimed coordinates .",
    "this space - time plot is discussed further in the following section ( see fig.13c below ) .",
    "the fundamental error in fig.5a of incorrectly plotting the world line of the origin of s along the @xmath73 axis , instead of as in fig.6 , has been systematically repeated in almost all text book discussions of the minkowski plot .",
    "it will be seen however that the argument typically used to obtain the length contraction effect , although , finally , geometrically identical to minkowski s calculation , does not invoke the world lines pp of an object at rest in s , but considers , instead of the time - like interval relation invoked by minkowski ( the hyperbola through a and a ) , a space - like one involving directly the length of the considered object .",
    "for definiteness , the discussion of the minkowski plot in the widely - known book ` spacetime physics ' by taylor and wheeler  @xcite will be first considered .",
    "similar treatments are to be found in the books of aharoni  @xcite , panofsky and philips  @xcite and mermin  @xcite .",
    "minkowski s sign error in drawing the directions of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes has been replicated in many text books treating special relativity .",
    "a survey of such books in the library of the ` section de physique ' at the university of geneva and the cern library , turned up 24 books with the error , including notably the first volume of ` the feynman lectures in physics '  @xcite .",
    "the only exception found was a book by anderson  @xcite where the world line of s corresponding to the @xmath0 , @xmath73 axes as drawn in fig.5 is correctly given as @xmath115 corresponding to the lt : @xmath127 .",
    "however , this author does not use the minkowski plot to discuss time dilatation or ` length contraction ' , but rather the analysis of light signals observed in different inertial frames .",

    "@xcite is the basis for discussion of both time dilatation and ` length contraction ' in this book .",
    "an object at rest in s , lying along the @xmath0 axis , is considered and the world lines of the ends @xmath128 1 and @xmath128 2 of the object are drawn , end @xmath128 1 being at the origin of s. as in the original minkowski plot , fig.5a , the world line of the origin in s is incorrectly assumed to lie along the @xmath73 axis instead of on the other side of the @xmath54 axis , as in fig.6 .    in order to calculate the time dilatation effect it is assumed that the distance @xmath129 in the frame s represents one unit of time in the frame s , and that the distance @xmath130 represents one unit of time in the frame s. since @xmath131 and @xmath132 lie on the hyperbola : @xmath133 it follows that @xmath134 so that one unit of time in the frame s is assumed to correspond to @xmath135 units of time along the @xmath73 axis in the frame s  @xcite . to derive the time dilatation effect it is further assumed that the time in s of the event at @xmath132 in s is given by the orthogonal projection @xmath136 onto the @xmath54 axis .",

    "orthogonal projections of the points 1 and 2 on the world lines of end @xmath128 1 and end @xmath128 2 of the object onto either the @xmath99 or @xmath101 axes define the four time intervals o@xmath86p , o@xmath86q , o@xmath87n and o@xmath87r which are related by the condition @xmath170 however , only two of these intervals , @xmath171 and @xmath172 correspond to the times registered by the clocks in s at time @xmath54 in the frame s. the spurious ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect arises from incorrectly identifying either of the time intervals o@xmath86q or o@xmath87n with the observed time in s of an event at time @xmath54 in s.    the non - existent ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect then results , unlike ` length contraction ' , not from geometrical errors in the minkowski plot but from a fundamental misunderstanding of the physical meaning of time intervals corresponding to certain geometrical projections , regardless of whether the latter are correct ( as predicted by the lt ) as in fig.12b , or not , as in fig.12a .",
    "it is essential that two spatially separated and synchronised clocks , each with its own time reading , be introduced into the problem in order to perform any meaningful analysis of it .",
    "this is not the case for fig.11 , or the equivalent fig.67 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the discussion of ` length contraction ' in mermin s book ` space and time in special relativity '  @xcite is similar to that of taylor and wheeler  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , illustrating mermin s interpretation of ` length contraction ' is the same as that of fig.9a of the present paper and the same incorrect result ( 5.12 ) is obtained .",
    "mermin s discussion of ` relativity of simultaneity ' is , however , somewhat different to that of other authors . instead of considering , as in ref .",
    "@xcite the abstract geometrical projections of fig.11 , the world lines of two clocks at rest in the frame s are considered , which at least , unlike fig.11 , satisifies the minimum condition for a meaningful discussion of the problem . in fig.13a is shown a fair copy of fig.17.22 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the basis of the discussion there of ` relativity of simultaneity ' .",
    "the s frame coordinates @xmath152 and @xmath138 related to @xmath0 and @xmath73 by the relations ( 5.13 ) and ( 5.4 ) , repectively , also given by mermin , are shown .",
    "the clocks are synchronised at @xmath173 and it is shown that at the later time when the world line of clock 2 crosses the @xmath152 axis an observer in s will see that it is in advance of the clock 1 by the time interval , @xmath174 that has elapsed in the frame s. this is supposed to be evident from the figure ( perhaps from an oblique projection parallel to the @xmath152 axis ? ) since no supporting explanation or calculation is given .",
    "the claimed ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect is such that @xmath175 . comparing in fig.13b different projections of simultaneous events in s on the world lines of the clocks , shows that an oblique projection , as used in mermin s discussion of ` length contraction ' , gives instead @xmath176 .",
    "projection orthogonal to the @xmath54 axis onto the @xmath138 axis gives simultaneous events in s. indeed , fig.13b indicates that in order to obtain @xmath175 a projection orthogonal to the @xmath138 axis is required .",
    "such a projection is nowhere else mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the correct simultaneity analysis , according to the lt , of events on the world lines of clocks at rest in s is shown in fig.13c , which is analogous to figs.5 and 12b .",
    "since the clocks are at rest in the frame s , their world lines in the frame s are : @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the minkowski plot given by the lt in the frame s is then the same as fig.6 , but with exchange of primed and unprimed coordinates .",
    "as can be seen in fig.13c , the @xmath0 and @xmath73 axes are orthogonal as a conseqence of the relations , the inverse of ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) : @xmath179 while the @xmath180 and @xmath181 axes are obliquely oriented . as evident , in any case , from translational invariance ,",
    "the projections in fig.13c show that there is no ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect in the problem .",
    "notice that , in this case , the td effect is inverted with respect to that shown in fig.2 above ; i.e. the clocks in the frame s appear , to an observer in this frame , to be running faster than those in s. the space - time experiment shown in fig.13c is thus the reciprocal of that in fig.2 .",
    "the manifest translational invariance of the td relations in ( 2.13 ) demonstrate the spurious nature of correlated ` relativity of simultaneity ' and ` length contraction ' effects that have hitherto , following einstein  @xcite , been derived from the lt , as explained in previous papers by the present author  @xcite and section 2 of the present paper .",
    "alternative derivations of ` length contraction ' from the geometry of the minkowski plot are shown to be flawed by a sign error in an angle , when drawing the @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes on the original minkowski plot  @xcite , which has been propagated , uncorrected , in essentially all text - book treatments of the subject , as well as the use projection operations at variance with those required by the lt .",
    "when the correct projection and scaling operations derived in section 3 , directly from the lt , are applied , it is clear , by simple inspection , ( see fig . 3 and fig .",
    "9b ) that there is no ` length contraction ' effect .",
    "the ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect derived from the minkowski plot , unlike that obtained in eqns(2.14)-(2.17 ) , directly from misuse of the lt , is not a direct consequence of the ` length contraction ' effect obtained from the same plot .",
    "it is , instead , produced by a false identification of certain projections on the plot with the times recorded by two spatially separated and synchronised clocks .",
    "it is shown in fig.12a , that , even with an incorrect oblique projection procedure , similar to that used to obtain ` length contraction ' , there is no corresponding ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect .",
    "the present author has been able to find only one text book in which the @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes of the minkowski plot are correctly drawn  @xcite .",
