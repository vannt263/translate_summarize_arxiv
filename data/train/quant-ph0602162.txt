    "as is well - known , power spectra of voltage fluctuations in all conducting materials exhibit a universal profile in the low - frequency limit , which is close to inverse frequency dependence .",
    "fluctuations characterized by the power spectrum of this type are called usually @xmath0 or flicker , noise .",
    "although this noise dominates only at low frequencies , experiments show the presence of the @xmath1-component in the whole measured frequency band up to @xmath2 despite numerous attempts , no lower frequency bound for the @xmath1 law has been found .",
    "in addition to that , it is generally accepted that @xmath1-noise produced by a sample is universally characterized by the following properties 1 ) it is ( roughly ) inversely proportional to the sample volume , 2 ) it is gaussian , and 3 ) its part induced by external electric field is proportional to the field strength squared .",
    "a number of mechanisms has been suggested to explain the origin of @xmath1-noise @xcite .",
    "there is a widespread opinion that this noise arises from resistance fluctuations , which is quite natural taking into account the property 3 ) mentioned above .",
    "indeed , for a given current through the sample , the mean squares of voltage and resistance fluctuations are proportional to each other , the current squared being the proportionality coefficient .",
    "it has been proposed that the resistance fluctuations possessing the other properties of flicker noise might result from temperature fluctuations @xcite , fluctuations in the carrier mobility @xcite or in the number of carriers caused by surface traps @xcite .",
    "all these models , however , have restricted validity , because they involve one or another assumption specific to the problem under consideration .",
    "for instance , assuming that the resistance fluctuations arise from the temperature fluctuations , one has to choose an appropriate spatial correlation of these fluctuations in order to obtain the desired profile of the power spectrum . similarly , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite requires specific distribution of trapping times .",
    "in addition to that , the models proposed so far reproduce the @xmath1-profile only in a restricted range of frequencies , require an appropriate normalization of the power spectrum , etc . at the same time ,",
    "ubiquity of flicker noise and universality of its properties suggest existence of a simple and universal , and therefore , fundamental origin .",
    "it is natural to look for this reason in the quantum properties of charge carriers . in this direction ,",
    "the problem has been extensively investigated by handel and co - workers @xcite .",
    "handel s approach is based on the theory of infrared radiative corrections in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "handel showed that the @xmath1 power spectrum of photons emitted in any scattering process can be derived from the well - know property of bremsstrahlung , namely , from the infrared divergence of the cross - section considered as a function of the energy loss .",
    "thus , this theory treats the @xmath1-noise as a relativistic effect ( in fact , the noise level in this theory @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fine structure constant , @xmath5 velocity change of the particle being scattered , and @xmath6 the speed of light ) .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the handel s theory has been severely criticized in many respects @xcite .    in refs .",

    "it was proved , in particular , that the power spectrum possesses the properties 1 ) , 2 ) of flicker noise , mentioned above . as to the property 3 ) , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that this requirement is also met .",
    "the argument was based on the assumption of analyticity of the electron density matrix with respect to the external electric field .",
    "however , this assumption is not valid in general .",
    "thus , the issue concerning the influence of external field is left open .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the influence of the external electric field on quantum electromagnetic fluctuations in detail .",
    "we will show that for all practically relevant values of the field strength , the power spectrum of induced fluctuations is proportional to the field strength squared indeed .",

    "our aim below will be to investigate low - frequency properties of this dispersion .",
    "it is clear that the condition @xmath19 is irrelevant in this investigation , because the low - frequency asymptotic of the power spectrum of correlations is determined largely by the late - time behavior of the function @xmath20 where @xmath15 is unbounded ( for a free particle state , and for large times @xmath21 @xmath15 is a linear function of @xmath22 ) .    as in ref .",

    "the main result of the present work is the general formula ( [ main1 ] ) describing the power spectrum of quantum electromagnetic fluctuations produced by elementary particles in the presence of an external field .",

    "we have applied the general formula to the calculation of the power spectrum of fluctuations produced by electrons in a sample in external electric field , assuming that the electron kinetics is described by a model equation with the relaxation - type collision term .",
    "this calculation shows that the power spectrum of induced fluctuations is proportional to the field strength squared for all practically relevant values of the electric field .",

    "qualitatively , the established properties of quantum electromagnetic fluctuations match perfectly with the experimentally observed properties of @xmath1-noise , and suggest that these fluctuations can be considered as one of the underlying mechanisms of flicker noise . as to the quantitative side , the estimates of ref .",

    "[ external ] , the change of the noise level in external electric field is relatively small , which disagrees with observations .",
    "of course , it is difficult to expect that predictions of the simple model employed in sec .  [ external ]",
    "will be quantitatively correct .",
    "although the found disagreement may be the result of the model oversimplification , it raises the question of possible alternative mechanisms of the noise amplification by external field .",
    "recall that the expression ( [ main5 ] ) for the power spectrum of fluctuations produced by a sample was derived assuming uniform distribution of the time instants @xmath75 therefore , correlation between @xmath174 s is a possible source of the noise amplification .",
    "since the number of electrons in the sample is large , already a relatively small correlation in the values of @xmath174 would result in a noticeable increase of the noise level .",
    "thus , the question concerning the relative role of the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations in explaining the observed @xmath1 noise requires further investigation .",
