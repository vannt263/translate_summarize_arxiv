    "a4 ) , allowed analysts to rule out the possibility that these line candidates could be explained by a sudden change in continuum shape .",
    "mazets et al",
    ".  posited that the konus line candidates were formed by either cyclotron absorption or cyclotron scattering in the strong magnetic fields of galactic neutron stars ( @xmath1 10@xmath2 g ) .",
    "the observation of harmonically spaced line candidates gave further credence to this hypothesis , because the quantization of an electron s energy perpendicular to a strong field can lead to the formation of evenly spaced lines with energies @xmath8 11.6@xmath9 kev .",
    "rigorous proof of the viability of this hypothesis came when a number of analysts used theoretical models of cyclotron scattering ( and not cyclotron absorption ) to produce emergent spectra from line - forming regions , which were found to compare favorably with the _ ginga _ data ( wang et al .",
    "1989a ; alexander & mszros 1989 ; nishimura et al .  1992 ; wang , wasserman , & lamb 1993 ) . for instance , wang et al .  ( 1989a ) used a monte carlo radiative transfer code ( wang , wasserman , & salpeter 1988 , 1989b ; lamb et al .",
    "1989 ) to demonstrate that the harmonic line candidates in the grb880205 spectrum could be produced in a line - forming layer with magnetic field 1.7 @xmath10 10@xmath2 g and column density 1.2 @xmath10 10@xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "freeman et al .",
    "( 1992 ) later demonstrated that deepening the scattering region behind the continuum source led to a substantially better fit to these same data .",
    "the cyclotron scattering interpretation for line candidates went largely unchallenged when it was consistent with the prevailing view that grb sources were neutron stars residing in a thick disk in the milky way ( with scale height @xmath0 2 kpc ; see , e.g. , higdon & lingenfelter 1990 , harding 1991 ) .",
    "however , recent developments , while not challenging the cyclotron scattering picture _ per se _ , have led many to question whether the reported line candidates actually exist at all .",
    "first , the discovery of optical transients ( ots ) associated with grbs ( e.g.  van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) , and the apparent determination of redshifts for five of them@xmath3grb970508 ( metzger et al .  1997 ) , grb971214 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) , grb980613 ( djorgovski et al .  1999 ) , grb980703 ( djorgovski et al .  1998 ) , and grb990123 ( kelson et al .",
    "1999)@xmath3have indicated that some ( if not all ) grbs occur at cosmological distances .",
    "second , there have been no reports of definitive detections of line candidates in spectra of the burst and transient source experiment spectroscopy detectors ( batse sds ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( palmer et al .  1994 , band et al .",
    "1996 , briggs et al .  1996 , 1998 ) . these developments , combined with the apparent difficulty of forming lines in the circumstellar environments of cosmological burst sources ( cf",
    "stanek , paczyski , & goodman 1993 and ulmer & goodman 1995 , who attempt to account for lines by invoking gravitational femtolensing ) , have led many to adopt the viewpoint that _ all _ bursts are cosmological and that the reported line candidates , for whatever reason , are not real .",
    "this viewpoint may be intuitively reasonable on its surface .",
    "however , while we do not seek to disprove the posited cosmological origin of the grbs listed above , we feel that there are several reasons why we should continue to test the cyclotron scattering model . while none are completely compelling by themselves",
    ", they cumulatively indicate that the complete solution of the grb mystery may have not yet been provided by the discovery of grb redshifts .",
    "the first reasons are the suggestive pieces of direct observational evidence that there are two or more classes of classical gamma - ray bursts .",
    "these pieces of evidence range from the well - established to the speculative .",
    "well - established is the identification of two classes with differing light - curve morphologies ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1993 , using burst duration ; lamb , graziani , & smith 1993 , using light curve variability ) .",
    "further studies lend credence to the reality of separate classes ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1996 ; katz & canel 1996 ) , but it is not yet proved that the correlation of burst properties can not be explained using a single underlying mechanism .",
    "less well - established , but still highly suggestive , evidence is provided by burst repetition ( e.g.  quashnock & lamb 1993 , wang & lingenfelter 1995 ) . unlike classes based on light - curve morphology , repetition indicates directly that there must be a galactic component to the overall grb source population , since it is generally considered impossible for cosmological bursters caused by one - time events such as neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole mergers to repeat .",
    "evidence for repetition is absent from the third batse ( 3b ) catalog ( meegan et al .",
    "1996 , tegmark et al .",
    "1996 ) , but graziani & lamb ( 1996 ) have questioned how the systematic errors of this catalog are computed .",
    "( for details on the batse burst location algorithm , see pendleton et al .",
    "1999 ) . also , in october 1996 , after the publication of the 3b catalog , batse observed four bursts in less than two days which all came from directions consistent with a single source .",
    "graziani , lamb , & quashnock ( 1998 ) perform simulations which indicate that the probability of such a spatial and temporal coincidence of four distinct bursts from four different sources is 3.1 @xmath10 10@xmath13 .",
    "the probability is increased to 1.6 @xmath10 10@xmath4 if only three bursts occurred , but one of the three would have to be the longest ever observed by batse .",
    "the most speculative piece of evidence is the apparent lack of consistency that recently localized bursts show when examined in other wavebands .",
    "for instance , since the beginning of 1997 , there have been eleven grbs observed with the _ bepposax _ wfc and/or the _ rxte _ asm detectors whose positions have been refined through the use of the interplanetary network ( ipn).jcg / grbgen.html , which contains complete references , including texts of circulars , for each burst .",
    "] of these eleven bursts , x - ray afterglows , ots , and radio afterglows were detected for eight , six , and three of them respectively .",
    "( two have measured redshifts and are thus conclusively cosmological@xmath3grb971214 and grb990123 . )",
    "the lack of counterparts may be , of course , more simply explained by invoking , e.g. , selection effects , rather than by invoking a separate class of bursters whose broad - band behavior is such that they do not show optically transient emission .",
    "also , if there is a separate class of bursters which are defined by counterpart behavior , it would not necessarily have to be associated with the milky way .",
    "another reason for us to continue to test the cyclotron scattering model is the result of the exacting statistical analysis of the 3b catalog performed by loredo & wasserman ( 1995 , 1998a , b ) .",
    "they determine that the 3b catalog is consistent with the hypothesis that there is a component of the grb source population residing within the galaxy , with that component comprised of either dim local halo sources at distances @xmath14 1 kpc ( accounting for up to @xmath0 60% of all bursts ) , or luminous halo sources at distances @xmath15 50 kpc ( accounting for up to @xmath0 10% of all bursts ) .",
    "studies show that neutron stars which receive high initial kick velocities when they are formed can populate the halo ( e.g.  li & dermer 1992 ; podziadlowski , rees , & ruderman 1995 ; bulik , lamb , & coppi 1998 ) .",
    "such  hybrid \" models with both galactic and cosmological bursters fit to the 3b data better than models with only cosmological bursters , in part because the existence of a highly isotropic , extragalactic burst component weakens greatly the isotropy constraints on any anisotropic galactic component .",
    "however , the fit is not so much better as to rule out models containing only cosmological bursters .",
    "a final reason to continue to test the cyclotron scattering model is the fact that the batse sds _ may _ lack the low - energy spectral sensitivity that is necessary for low - energy lines to be easily detected .",
    "the gain settings on the individual sds differ ; those with the highest gain settings can , in principle , observe grbs at energies @xmath15 10 kev .",
    "an electronic artifact discovered after launch affects energy calibration such that spectra are distorted in the first @xmath0 10 channels above the low - energy cutoff ( the so - called `` sled '' effect ; see band et al .",
    "1992 ) . despite this",
    ", studies using simulated _ ginga _ line candidate spectra indicated that the sds were still capable of detecting low - energy line candidates ( band et al .",
    "1995 ) , and no line candidates were definitively detected during initial visual searches of those spectra with the largest signal - to - noise ratios ( palmer et al .",
    "1994 , band et al .",
    "an automated line candidate search algorithm designed by the batse sd team ( briggs et al .",
    "1996 ) was then applied to spectra in 117 bright bursts for which there is at least one spectrum with signal - to - noise @xmath16 5 at @xmath0 40 kev ( briggs et al .",
    "1998 ) . this automated search , which is considerably more sensitive than a visual search , yielded 12 candidate spectral line candidates for which the change in @xmath17 between the continuum and continuum - plus - line fits is @xmath18 ( significance @xmath19 ) .",
    "perhaps problematically , all the line candidates except one are emission - like lines observed at @xmath0 40 kev , with the one exception being an absorption - like line candidate observed at @xmath0 60 kev .",
    "briggs et al .  (",
    "1998 ) can not rule out the possibility that sharp breaks in the continua , instead of lines , cause the observed features , but such breaks would be inconsistent with low - energy _ ginga _ grb data .",
    "briggs et al .",
    "estimate the ensemble chance probability of the most - significant feature as @xmath14 10@xmath4 , and state that few of these features , if any , result from statistical fluctuations .",
    "however , these lines should not be considered definitively detected , as the contemporaneous data from other sds is still being examined ( briggs et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we feel that the aforementioned reasons give us ample justification to test the cyclotron scattering model further . in this paper , we use it to examine the lines 10@xmath5 .",
    "thus we feel that we may drop the word  candidates \" when referring to these lines throughout the remainder of this paper . ] exhibited by grb870303 s1 and s2 .",
    "successful fits of the cyclotron scattering model to these data , when paired with the successful fits of cyclotron scattering models to the data of grb880205 by wang et al .",
    "( 1989a ) and freeman et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , would further strengthen the evidence supporting our contention that that some ( though not all ) grbs are galactic in origin .",
    "in  [ sect : geom ] , we describe the spatial geometry of the line - formation region .",
    "we assume it to be a static plane - parallel slab of electrons threaded by a strong magnetic field , which can be oriented at an arbitrary angle relative to the slab normal ( unlike in wang et al .",
    "1989a , where the field was parallel to the slab normal ) .",
    "the assumption of a static slab is strictly valid only for bursters located within @xmath1 100 pc , _ if _ line formation occurs at the magnetic pole , since otherwise the inferred burst luminosity would exceed the eddington limit and radiation forces would blow the line - forming layer off in a wind ( see isenberg , lamb , & wang 1998a , who modify the code to examine the theoretical ramifications of a wind ) . as noted above , such distances are consistent with current observational limits ( loredo & wasserman 1998b ) .",
    "if line formation occurs away from the magnetic pole , then the assumption of a static slab may be valid even for luminous halo bursters at distances @xmath1 100 kpc because of the confinement provided by closed magnetic field lines ( e.g.  zheleznyakov and serber 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "we examine two slab geometries , which we denote `` 1 - 0 '' and the `` 1 - 1 '' , where the numbers represent relative electron column densities above and below the continuum photon source plane .",
    "a slab illuminated from below represents a line - forming region in the magnetosphere of a neutron star , while a source plane embedded within a slab corresponds to line formation within a semi - infinite neutron star atmosphere .    in",
    " [ sect : phys ] , we summarize the physics of radiation transfer in strong magnetic fields that is incorporated into the monte carlo code we use to generate spectra ( wang et al .",
    "1988 , 1989b ; lamb et al .  1989 ; lamb , wang , & wasserman  1990 ; and references therein ) , and in  [ sect : samp ] we provide examples of these spectra .",
    "as noted above , resonant cyclotron scattering , and not cyclotron absorption , describes the peculiar properties of the _ ginga _ lines@xmath3the comparable strengths of first and second harmonics , the absence of third and higher harmonics , and the narrowness of the lines .",
    "the appearance of the lines is greatly affected by raman scattering , i.e.  resonant cyclotron scattering in which the electron is excited from the ground state directly to the second or higher landau level , but then deexcites back to the ground state indirectly via intermediate energy levels . in raman scattering",
    ", the original photon is destroyed , and two or more photons are created ( or _ spawned _ ) as the electron deexcites . spawned photons with energies near that of the first harmonic line",
    "alter its profile and reduce its equivalent width to a value similar to that of the second harmonic line . because the majority of photons which undergo scattering at the second and higher harmonics are destroyed , the lines have an approximately absorption - like profile .",
    "the third harmonic is not seen because its optical depth is small compared to that of the second harmonic ( @xmath20 0.05@xmath21 ) .",
    "narrow lines result from the fact that the line - forming region is optically thin to all continuum photons except for those with energies equal to the first and second harmonic energies .",
    "thus scattered photons at @xmath0 20 kev , and not continuum photons @xmath15 1 mev , dictate the temperature of the line - forming region , and the line width .    in  [ sect : stat ] we summarize the statistical concepts which we use in this paper .",
    "these concepts are described in more detail in paper i and freeman et al .",
    "( 1998b ; hereafter paper iii ) . in those works ,",
    "we present general , rigorous methodologies that address the problem of establishing the existence of a line in a spectrum , that are based upon both the so - called  frequentist , \" and bayesian , paradigms of statistical inference . in this work , instead of establishing the existence of lines , our statistical goal is to compare azimuthally symmetric models of line formation , i.e.  models in which the magnetic field is parallel to the slab normal , with models having arbitrary magnetic field orientations . if the grb source is a neutron star with a simple dipole field , these two classes may be interpreted as representing line formation at the magnetic pole , or elsewhere .",
    "we use a rigorous method of model comparison ( described in  [ sect : modcomp ] ) to select between polar cap and more general models , demanding , e.g. , that the increase in the quality of the fit of general models be sufficiently great to justify considering of the ramifications of line formation away from the pole .",
    "once best - fit models are selected , we use a rigorous method of parameter estimation ( described in  [ sect : parest ] ) to place limits on each of the model parameters .",
    "we apply the cyclotron scattering model to the data of grb870303 s1 and s2 in  [ sect : appl ] .",

    "we interpret the change in orientation by invoking neutron star rotation , and in  [ sect : rot ] ( and the appendix ) we describe how we place limits on the rotation period .    in  [ sect : disc ] , we discuss our results .",

    "the simplification led to the appearance of spikes in some cyclotron scattering spectra at energies just above that of the first harmonic ( e.g.  as @xmath92 0 for @xmath31 = 0 ) .",
    "this spike contained both photons which were scattered at the first harmonic , and spawned photons resulting from raman scattering at the second and higher harmonics , which then immediately escaped from the slab .",

    "photons in the first harmonic core will , on average , scatter at least this many times for the 1 - 1 geometry , but not for the 1 - 0 geometry , for the values of @xmath61 considered in this paper .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the 1 - 0 geometry , photons which scatter in the line core may cross the source plane , whereupon they are lost from the calculation .",
    "the size of the shoulders will change depending upon the importance of raman scattering in the line - forming region , since this dictates the number of photons spawned within the first harmonic line core .",
    "their relative size in the red and blue wings is determined by the relationship between @xmath67 and @xmath66 ; because we assume these temperatures to be equal , the equivalent widths of the two shoulders will be equal .",

    "hence , @xmath66 is _ not _ a free parameter of the fit .",
    "photons emerging from the line - forming region are binned .",
    "we generally use eight bins spanning @xmath25 = [ 0,1 ] ( where @xmath34 ; an exception made in fits to grb870303 s1 ) . as for @xmath26 , if @xmath73 0 and @xmath117 , we may take advantage of symmetry across the @xmath118-plane to use eight bins spanning @xmath26 = [ 0,@xmath119 .",
    "if @xmath31 = @xmath120 , further symmetry across the plane perpendicular to the @xmath118-plane allows us to reduce the number of bins to four , spanning @xmath26 = [ 0,@xmath120 ] .",
    "we find that a spectrum is sufficiently accurate , i.e.  the counts standard deviation in each output bin is sufficiently low , if @xmath1 10@xmath122 photons are injected into the line - forming region .",
    "we also find that the number of photons needed to accurately portray the low - energy line profiles is roughly an order of magnitude fewer than the number needed to accurately portray the high - energy continuum ( @xmath123 100 kev ) .",
    "we can not ignore the high - energy continuum , because the _ ginga _ gbd recorded the energy lost by an impinging photon ( e.g.  a 500 kev photon may have lost only 20 kev while passing through the gbd , leading to the recording of a count within the energy regime of interest ) .",

    "the results of fits to the s1 data argue against static line formation at the magnetic polar cap .",
    "if line formation does indeed occur above the polar cap in an outflowing plasma , the neutron star probably resides within the galactic halo at a distance of @xmath15 50 kpc .",
    "two lines of reasoning point to this conclusion .",
    "first , as pointed out by lamb et al .  (",
    "1990 ) , a static polar cap line formation region will be disrupted on timescales @xmath1 10@xmath174 s unless the the burst flux is below the magnetic eddington limit . at the non - magnetic eddington limit , the radiative pressure exerted by both line and continuum photons upon electrons in the line - forming layer balances the gravitational force upon the protons which are electrostatically coupled to the electrons ; the magnetic eddington limit is determined by replacing the thomson cross - section of the electron with the resonant cyclotron scattering cross - section of the first harmonic .",
    "this lowers the luminosity limit from @xmath1 10@xmath222 erg s@xmath223 to @xmath1 10@xmath224 erg s@xmath223 .",
    "the upper limit on the distance to the burst source with an electron - proton line - forming layer is thus @xmath1 100 pc .",
    "second , loredo & wasserman ( 1998b ) determine that the data of the 3b catalog ( meegan et al .",
    "1996 ) is consistent with the hypothesis that there is a component of the source population residing within the galaxy , with that component either being comprised of dim local halo sources at distances @xmath14 1 kpc , or luminous halo sources at distances @xmath15 50 kpc .",
    "they make this conclusion by using bayesian methods ( developed in loredo & wasserman 1995 ) to compare a model in which sources residing in a bahcall - soneira halo with core size 2 kpc ( bahcall & soneira 1980 ) are mixed with cosmological grb sources , with the best - fit cosmological grb source model from loredo & wasserman ( 1998a ) . each class is assumed to contain standard candle bursters , with the further assumptions for the cosmological bursters that the comoving burst rate is homogeneous and independent of redshift .",
    "( loredo & wasserman 1998a demonstrate that this simple cosmological model fits the data as well as more complicated models with either an inhomogeneous burst rate or a power - law burst luminosity function . )",
    "the best fit of the halo model is better than that of the purely cosmological model , for both dim local and luminous halo bursters .",
    "the best - fit fractions of dim local halo sources are 0.59 ( 64 ms 3b catalog data ) and 0.36 ( 1024 ms data ) , and the bursters are limited to distances @xmath14 1 kpc ; the respective fractions for luminous halo sources are 0.11 and 0.073 , with inferred distances @xmath15 50 kpc",
    ". however , the 3b data lack the power to tightly constrain the model parameters , and thus the credible intervals for each fraction include zero at a significance level @xmath14 2@xmath170 , or 95.5% .",
    "( despite the lack of constraining power , the data do not support the bursters residing at distances intermediate between 1 and 50 kpc . ) because of this lack of constraining power , the bayesian odds favoring the galactic component models are not large : 2.5 and 6.7 ( 64 and 1024 ms ) for dim local halo sources , and 0.45 and 0.25 for luminous halo sources .",
    "an odds of @xmath16 10 - 20 would be considered strong evidence in favor of an alternative model ( see the review by kass & raftery 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "we note that if lines exhibited by accretion - powered pulsar ( app ) spectra are also formed via cyclotron scattering , the lack of shoulders in the 12 known apps with lines ( mihara 1995 ) places a lower limit on column densities that is much larger than the column densities determined in our analyses , within the context of the 1 - 1 geometry .",
    "this result is shown by isenberg et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , who consider cylindrical line - formation regions with photon injection along the axis , which represent the canonical model of the emission region of accretion - powered pulsars .",
    "they show that if @xmath225 1000 , the shoulders disappear .",
    "this implies that even if the 1 - 1 geometry is an acceptable approximation for both apps and grbs , the mechanisms underlying line formation must be significantly different .",
    "the most theoretically intriguing result of our analyses is the possibility that line - formation may occur away from the magnetic polar cap ( i.e. for @xmath73 0 ) .",
    "the s1 data provide strong evidence that , for the 1 - 1 geometry , line formation does not occur at the polar cap , with the best - fit location being the magnetic equator ( @xmath31 = @xmath120 ) .",
    "the combined ( s1+s2 ) data provide marginal evidence , for both geometries , favoring equatorial line formation .",
    "line formation at a magnetic equator may be static even if the burst luminosity greatly exceeds the critical eddington luminosity in a strong magnetic field , since the closed magnetic field lines there may effectively trap the plasma ( see , e.g. , zheleznyakov & serber 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "thus the assumption of line formation in static layers may be acceptable even if the progenitor neutron star resides in the galactic halo at distances @xmath15 50 kpc .",
    "if line formation occurs at the magnetic polar cap of a luminous halo burster , the line formation region will initially flow outwards along @xmath30 . in an outflow ,",
    "the variation of the magnetic field and plasma velocity with altitude will tend to broaden the lines .",
    "thus the relevant question is whether we can still observe narrow lines in the spectra of distant halo grbs .",
    "the answer appears to be yes .",
    "miller et al .  (",
    "1991,1992 ) calculated the properties of the second and third harmonics , approximating raman scattering with cyclotron absorption ( see  [ sect : cycabs ] ) .",
    "they showed that narrow lines can be formed at these harmonics , and they successfully fit outflow absorption models to the second harmonic of grb880205 .",
    "chernenko & mitrofanov ( 1995 ) calculate the properties of the first harmonic line in an outflow , but they assume the line to be formed via absorption ; they find that narrow first harmonic lines are possible .",
    "isenberg et al .  ( 1998a ) show that the cyclotron scattering model can create narrow lines at all harmonics .",
    "they treat this problem using a variant of the monte carlo code applied in this work .",
    "they assume a hot spot at the magnetic pole of a neutron star , and apply the radiation force calculation of mitrofanov & tsygan ( 1982 ) to determine the plasma outflow velocity .",
    "they conclude that cyclotron scattering lines can form within a relativistic outflow with properties similar to those of grb870303 and grb880205 , provided the hot spot is a small fraction of the stellar surface ( @xmath226 0.1@xmath227 ) .",
    "a natural consequence of the fact that the line - forming layer may move along field lines is that the height of the line - forming layer may change with time , as , for example , the burst intensity or hot spot radius changes .",
    "a change in height would be accompanied by a change in inferred magnetic field strength ( i.e.  by an inferred shift in line - centroid energy ) .",
    "yoshida et al .  ( 1992 ) report that the magnetic field strength shows a declining trend within the 9 s interval in which the line candidates of grb880205 have maximum significance , which indicates that the line - forming region is flowing outwards from the neutron star .",

    "@xmath247 and @xmath248 , however , have no direct physical meaning .",
    "we may use the cyclotron absorption model to describe the line - formation region if at least both the second and third harmonics are strong , i.e.  the data request that each of these harmonics be fit with a line shape parameterized by centroid energy , equivalent width , and full - width ( see paper i for a description of this particular parameterization ) . only then is the number of required fit parameters , five ( we assume @xmath249 ) , larger than the number of physical parameters needed to describe the region ( @xmath113 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath235 ) .",
    "otherwise , such as when only the first and second harmonics are observed , radiative transfer calculations are required .",
    "no simple description can be used to explain the first harmonic line , the appearance of which depends critically on the outcome of the multiple resonant scatters required in order for individual photons to escape , as well as on the introduction of spawned photons at energies near that of the first harmonic .",
    "the cyclotron scattering model can describe the line - forming region using fewer free parameters than the cyclotron absorption model ( because of the relationship between @xmath67 and @xmath113 in the scattering model ) , and can use the first harmonic data to help forge the description .",
    "however , we have found that moderate resolution grb data may require an even smaller number of free parameters than the minimum three of the cyclotron scattering model . in table [ tab : disc ] , we list the number of model parameters required in fits to the grb870303 data with the exponentiated gaussian absorption line model ( paper i ) , and the cyclotron absorption and scattering models .",
    "each harmonic in these data can be adequately modeled with a saturated line shape parameterized by centroid energy and equivalent width ; the full - width is set to be proportional to the equivalent width .",
    "the number of free parameters is then @xmath252 + 1 , where @xmath252 is the number of observed harmonics ( @xmath252 line width parameters and one harmonic line energy ) .",
    "this is an upper limit .",
    "for instance , the s2 data is adequately fit using two , rather than three , parameters ( by setting @xmath253=2@xmath254 ) , because the second harmonic data lack constraining power .",
    "lamb ( 1992 ) argues that physically - based models which have parameters not required by the data will ( 1 ) adequately fit the data , but ( 2 ) have reduced diagnostic power because of a lack of constraint on the individual model parameters .",
    "this is certainly true for the cyclotron absorption model . for both grb870303 ( graziani et al .",
    "1992 ) and grb880205 ( fenimore et al .  1988 ) , the cyclotron absorption model determines the magnetic field well ( since it is a function of only @xmath255 ) , but @xmath235 is undetermined and @xmath256 and @xmath257 are therefore poorly constrained .",
    "however , we determine in this work that photon spawning and the presence of line shoulders give the cyclotron scattering model greater diagnostic power than we would have predicted .",
    "( note that such the absorption model fits adequately because large shoulders are not observed in grb870303 and grb880205 ; if large shoulders were present , no model using absorption - like profiles would adequately fit the data . ) spawned photons fill the first harmonic in the polar cap model , decreasing its ability to adequately fit the s1 data in the 1 - 0 geometry ; the addition of shoulders in the 1 - 1 geometry makes no adequate fit possible . while polar cap models adequately fit the s2 data , the line shoulders which appear in the 1 - 1 geometry greatly reduce the range of @xmath25 consistent with the data ( cf .",

    "would thus be expected to provide the best fit to the data .",
    "fits of the general model to the joint data fulfill that expectation , with six and seven parameter models chosen .",
    "surprisingly , however , the simplest three - parameter polar cap models adequately fit the data for both the 1 - 0 and 1 - 1 geometries ; spawned photons and line shoulders prevent the data from selecting more complex models over the simplest model , even if up to six parameters are allowed to float freely ( table [ tab : modfit ] ) .      the use of cyclotron scattering models allows us to place rigorous limits upon the rotation period of the neutron star source of grb870303 .",

    "no spectral features are apparent , but the spectrum is perhaps too soft for lines to be unambiguously detected . such a periodicity is perhaps barely consistent with @xmath259 in the 1 - 0 geometry , but is consistent with both @xmath259 and @xmath260 in the 1 - 1 geometry . if we hypothesize that the neutron star completes more than half a rotation between s1 and s2 , it follows that a localized region of line formation disappears behind the stellar disk between the two epochs .",
    "graziani et al .",
    "( 1993 ) consider a model in which lines appear at time @xmath261 , disappear at time @xmath262 , and are constant in between .",

    "mass - transfer from companions slows some accretion - powered x - ray pulsars , which have rotation periods up to @xmath0 800  s ( see , e.g. , nagase 1989 ) .",
    "similarly , accretion of matter onto high - velocity neutron stars on the way to or within a galactic corona may act to both slow a neutron star and provide fuel for grbs . repeated grbs ( graziani et al .",
    "1998 ) may in turn cause losses in angular momentum , slowing the neutron star , if mass is ejected from the source",

    "if both @xmath25 and @xmath26 change with time , we can not use the simple model described in  [ sect : rot ] , in which @xmath26 is constant in time , to place limits on the rotation period(s ) of the underlying neutron star . here",
    ", we outline a general bayesian method for deriving credible intervals for the rotation period(s ) .",

    "( there are four possible rotation periods that can be derived , for reasons given in  [ sect : rot ] and illustrated in figure [ fig : nsrot ] . )",

    "we expand it : @xmath268 we randomly sample @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath266 , and @xmath219 from uniform distributions .",
    "because of polar symmetry , the values @xmath269 and @xmath270 define circles centered on the visible disk of the neutron star where line formation may take place . given @xmath266 , we can define the magnetic equator , which either intersects the line - formation circle twice , or not at all .",
    "since we assume @xmath94 , the vector pointing out of the star at the intersection points is simply @xmath271 ( figure [ fig : coord ] ) . at the intersection points , @xmath272 = @xmath269 , where @xmath273 is the vector pointing to the observer .",
    "if we define @xmath273 as ( 0,-1,0 ) , @xmath269 = @xmath274 .",
    "the only unknown is then @xmath275 , which we can solve for numerically . given the location of line - formation , we project @xmath273 onto the local surface tangent ( i.e.  onto a vector which is perpendicular to @xmath271 ) .",
    "the dot product of this projected vector with the vector @xmath276 ( the direction of the field at the magnetic equator ) is the cosine of @xmath277 .",

    "either two solutions to these equations exist , or none at all . given a solution ,",
    "we next determine the possible local field direction @xmath281 .",
    "the vectors @xmath219 , @xmath282 , and @xmath278 allow us to use the law of cosines to determine @xmath105 , the angle through which the neutron star rotates between the two epochs .",
    "we transform the cartesian coordinate system such that @xmath283 = ( 0,0,1 ) , rotate the system through angle @xmath105 , and undo the transformation .",
    "we then solve for @xmath284 , as above .",

    "this distribution is known : two dimensional  slices \" of it are shown in figure [ fig:90jcred11 ] .",
    "we use this distribution as a rejection function : we assess the relative probability of our solution with respect to the best - fit parameters of the model , sample a random number @xmath287 , and accept the solution if @xmath288 .",
