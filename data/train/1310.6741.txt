    "when the motor head is bound to actin , and there is no tension on the end of the lever arm transmitted through the junction , the two states have relaxed configurations illustrated in fig .",
    "[ path]a ( left , center ) . in the pr state , the lever arm relaxes to an orientation tilting toward the actin minus end , while in the po state it tilts toward the plus end . in our model",
    ", the tilting preference of the po state enters as a harmonic constraint on the end - tangent of the bound leg : if @xmath27 is the unit tangent vector at the point where the polymer leg attaches to actin , we have a potential @xmath28 , with a constraint strength @xmath19 and direction @xmath29 .",
    "the vector @xmath30 is in the @xmath6 plane at an angle @xmath31 , measured counter - clockwise from the @xmath32 axis ( the @xmath30 direction is marked by a red dashed line in fig .",

    "however , as we will see below , all the kinetic pathways involve diffusion while the bound leg is in the po state , so the parameters of the pr state do not explicitly enter the calculation .",
    "hence , both @xmath19 and @xmath17 will refer only to the po state .",
    "if there is tension propagated through the junction on the end of the lever arm ( i.e. due to load , or the fact that both motor heads are bound to actin ) , the lever arm contour will be bent away from its relaxed conformation .",
    "[ path]a ( right ) shows the po state under backward tension on the arm : the lever arm is bent , adopting a shape that reflects several competing physical effects .",
    "the po constraint of strength @xmath19 tries to keep the head - arm angle near @xmath17 , the bending stiffness @xmath4 favors a straight lever arm contour , and the tension tries to pull the end of the arm backwards .",
    "the polymer model naturally incorporates the interplay of these effects , which we will show is crucial in determining the dynamical response of the motor to load .      the starting point for all myov kinetic pathways ( fig .",
    "[ path]c , left column ) is the waiting state , where both heads have adp , are strongly bound to actin , and are in the po state . because the leading ( l ) leg is connected to the trailing ( t ) leg at the junction , the l leg is under backward tension , and it bends in the manner discussed above .",
    "the resulting strained `` telemark '' or `` reverse arrowhead '' stance has been observed directly in both electron microscopy  @xcite and afm  @xcite images .",
    "the waiting state leads to four possible kinetic pathways ( fig .",
    "[ path]c ) :    _ 1 .",
    "forward step .",
    "adp is released from the trailing head ( th ) , followed by atp binding , which makes association of the head with actin weak , leading to detachment .",
    "we assume saturating atp concentrations ( @xmath34 m ) , where atp binding and subsequent th detachment is very fast compared with adp release , and hence the entire detachment process for the th is modeled with a single rate @xmath35 s@xmath23 , equal to the experimentally measured adp release rate  @xcite .",
    "if we set the origin ( @xmath36 ) at the position of the bound leading head ( lh ) , the free end of myov can diffuse and potentially rebind at one of two sites , @xmath37 along the actin filament ( fig .",
    "[ path]b ) .",
    "binding at @xmath38 leads to a forward step ( fig .",
    "[ path]a , row 1 ) .",
    "however successful binding is dependent on two conditions : ( i ) reaching the capture radius around the binding site ; ( ii ) the motor head having already hydrolyzed its bound atp .    during the diffusive search",
    ", the entire two - legged polymer structure fluctuates in three dimensions , subject only to the end - tangent constraint at the bound leg attachment point .",
    "first passage to a given binding site @xmath39 , which occurs at a mean time interval @xmath40 after detachment , is the first arrival of the detached head to any point within a radius @xmath20 of the binding site .",
    "the capture radius @xmath20 , which reflects the distance at which the free myov head can appreciably interact with the actin binding site  @xcite , is set to @xmath41 nm , comparable to the debye screening length @xmath42 in physiological and _ in vitro",
    "_ conditions ( i.e. for kcl concentrations of @xmath43 mm , @xmath44 nm ) .    the second condition for successful binding is the chemical state of the detached head . in order for the head to strongly associate and bind to actin",
    ", atp must hydrolyze to adp@xmath45p@xmath46 , which occurs at a rate @xmath47 s@xmath23  @xcite . along with hydrolysis",
    ", the detached head also undergoes a recovery stroke , which reverses the power stroke , changing the orientation of the head with respect to the lever arm ( po @xmath48 pr ) . for simplicity , we combine the nucleotide / head - arm orientation states of the detached head into two possibilities : a ) atp / po , b ) adp+p@xmath46 / pr . unless otherwise specified , we assume the transition a@xmath48b occurs irreversibly at a rate @xmath49 .",
    "( we will discuss one experimental variant of myov with modified light chain composition in the section on zero load binding kinetics , where there is a non - negligible reverse hydrolysis rate @xmath50 . )",
    "binding can only occur in state b , so if the detached th has reached the capture radius of one of the sites and the system is still in state a , it has zero probability of binding , resulting in the th continuing its diffusive trajectory . for forward stepping to occur , the th must reach the capture radius of @xmath38 in state b , and then it can bind with probability 1 .    after successful binding ,",
    "p@xmath46 is rapidly released from the bound head , which then results in a pr @xmath48 po transition , returning the motor to its waiting state , with both the heads being in the po state .",
    "release of the inorganic phosphate p@xmath46 and the power stroke are much faster than the detachment time scale @xmath51  @xcite , so we can assume that the motor with two bound heads spends nearly all its time waiting in the telemark stance .",
    "_ 2 . trailing foot stomp .",
    "_ this kinetic pathway ( fig .",
    "[ path]c , row 2 ) is similar to the forward step , except that the detached th diffuses to the site @xmath52 rather than @xmath38 .",
    "rebinding at @xmath52 brings the center - of - mass of the motor back to its original location , without any net movement along the actin . for the binding to be successful",
    ", the head must be in state b within the capture radius @xmath20 of @xmath52 , in which case it will bind with a probability @xmath53 .",
    "the reduced probability of binding is a crucial difference between the forward step and t foot stomp pathways .",
    "the binding penalty arises because the head in state b , after the recovery stroke , is in the pr orientation , which is believed to favor binding to the forward target site ( @xmath38 ) over the backward site ( @xmath52 )  @xcite .",
    "forward binding involves the detached head going in front of its lever arm , which has to tilt back towards the actin minus end ( the relaxed configuration of the pr state ) .",
    "backward binding has the opposite arrangement , with the lever arm bent towards the actin plus end , which is an unnatural configuration in the pr state , resulting in a strained back leg , as illustrated on the right in fig .",
    "[ path]c , row 2 .",
    "we model this effective extra energy barrier in the binding process through the probability @xmath21 .",
    "the greater the barrier , the smaller the value of @xmath21 .",
    "the hypothesis that the recovery stroke is important in favoring forward binding has found support in a recent single molecule study on single - headed myov  @xcite , which established that the pr orientation is highly kinetically and energetically stable ( with an energy barrier of at least 5 @xmath54 with respect to po ) .",
    "leading foot stomp .",
    "_ in addition to the two kinetic pathways above , initiated by th detachment , there are two other possibilities , that occur upon detachment of the lh .",
    "the first of these is the leading foot stomp , where the lh unbinds and then rebinds to its original site ( fig .",
    "[ path]c , row 3 ) .",
    "the detachment of the lh occurs at a slower rate than th detachment , @xmath55 , where we denote the factor @xmath56 as the gating ratio .",
    "this asymmetry arises from the intramolecular strain within the two - legged myov structure bound to actin  @xcite .",
    "the backward tension on the l lever arm in the waiting state slows down adp release in the lh by 50 - 70 fold compared to the th  @xcite , which makes detachment through the adp release / atp binding mechanism very rare .",
    "rather , the lh under backwards strain detaches primarily by an alternate pathway where it retains adp  @xcite , an assumption supported by the observation that single - headed myov under backwards loads of @xmath57 pn unbinds from actin at a slow rate of 1.5 s@xmath23 independent of both atp and adp concentrations  @xcite . as described below , the magnitude of the backward tension in the waiting state can also be directly estimated from the structural parameters of the polymer model , giving a value of @xmath58 pn , sufficient to be in the slow unbinding regime .",
    "based on these considerations , we set @xmath59 s@xmath23 in our model , giving a gating ratio @xmath60 .",
    "in other words , the th is 8 times more likely to detach than the lh per unit time .",
    "we also assume the lh always retains adp upon detachment ( staying in the po state  @xcite ) and thus no atp hydrolysis needs to occur before rebinding .    if we assign @xmath36 to be the position of the bound th , then the l foot stomp involves reattachment to its original site @xmath38 .",
    "since the lh is po , rebinding requires the lever arm to be bent backwards , contrary to the plus - directed relaxed orientation of the po state .",
    "we thus have a binding penalty analogous to the one for the t foot stomp : successful binding will occur with a probability @xmath21 within the capture radius @xmath20 around @xmath38 .",
    "there is no additional chemical requirement , since the lh is in an adp state with high affinity to actin .",
    "though it is possible to assign a distinct binding penalty @xmath21 for the t and l foot stomps , this does not lead to any major qualitative differences in the analysis below , so we assume for simplicity a single value of @xmath21 . after binding , myov returns to the waiting state .",
    "backward step .",
    "_ the final kinetic pathway proceeds analogously to the l foot stomp , but the detached lh diffuses and binds to the backward site @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ path]c , row 4 ) .",
    "myov thus steps backwards , shifting the center - of - mass towards the minus end of actin .",
    "the detached head retains adp , and stays in the po state . because a forward - tilted lever arm is the relaxed conformation in the po state",
    ", there is no binding penalty .",
    "therefore , upon reaching the capture radius @xmath20 around @xmath52 , the leg binds with probability 1 , and myov returns to the waiting state . the fact that backstepping in our model does not require atp hydrolysis is consistent with observations of atp - independent processive backwards stepping in the superstall regime ( @xmath61 pn )  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we will not consider the superstall case in the present study . in principle , our model could be generalized to the superstall regime by including additional kinetic pathways that occur under extremely large backward loads , for example power stroke reversal  @xcite .    in all of the four kinetic pathways described above ,",
    "only one leg is always bound to the actin during the diffusion step . if the bound leg detaches before the free leg binds , the processive run of myov is terminated .",
    "we assume a bound leg detachment rate @xmath24 during this process .",
    "this completes the description of the model , where each myov waiting state ends in five possible outcomes : forward stepping , t / l foot stomps , backward stepping , or detachment of both heads from actin .",
    "the first four pathways bring the system back to the waiting state , where the entire mechanochemical cycle can be repeated , while the last ends the run .",
    "the only parameters for which we do not have direct experimental estimates are the strength and direction of the power stroke constraint , @xmath19 and @xmath17 , and the binding penalty @xmath21",
    ". we will be able to fit these parameters by comparing the theoretical results to experimental data , as described below , resulting in the values listed in table  1 .",
    "imaging studies  @xcite suggest that the preferred po orientation @xmath17 is likely to be in the vicinity of @xmath18 , so this parameter could have been constrained from the outset .",
    "however we have allowed it to be a free parameter since the angle @xmath17 that appears in the potential function @xmath62 can in principle be slightly different than the observed orientation of the bound leg in any particular image , which is affected by both thermal fluctuations and any tension that is applied to the end of the bound leg . for the persistence length @xmath4 ,",
    "there are estimates ranging from @xmath63 nm  @xcite up to 375 nm  @xcite .",
    "we use the value @xmath64 nm , based on the measurements of moore _ et .",
    "@xcite . from the point of view of the polymer model ,",
    "the most important characteristic of the persistence length is that @xmath65 , so the legs behave almost as rigid rods .",
    "however , one of the major outcomes of our theory is that precise tuning of the parameters is not required to get efficient processive dynamics qualitatively similar to that seen in nature .",
    "the central physical quantity in our model is the first passage time to the binding site , @xmath66 , which depends sensitively on the interplay of bending stiffness ( @xmath4 ) , load force ( @xmath67 , @xmath7 ) , and power stroke constraint ( @xmath19 , @xmath17 ) ( fig .",
    "[ path]b ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath66 at a given @xmath67 compared to the hydrolysis and detachment rates , along with the size of the binding penalty , determines exactly how the system partitions between the various kinetic pathways .",
    "to the forward ( + ) and backward ( - ) sites , the the mean binding times @xmath68 , @xmath69 for the leading and trailing legs respectively , and the polymer relaxation time @xmath70 for the myov structure to equilibriate after the detachment of one leg . all results except @xmath70",

    "remarkably , the polymer model allows us to derive an approximate analytical expression for @xmath66 by exploiting the separation in time scales between polymer relaxation and the diffusive search ( for details see the methods and the supporting information ( si ) ) .",
    "if @xmath70 is the relaxation time for the two - legged polymer structure to equilibrate after one of the legs detaches , then @xmath73 . theory and simulations show that @xmath74 @xmath75s for nearly rigid legs at zero load , and becomes even smaller as @xmath67 increases ( fig .",

    "the value of @xmath70 is two orders of magnitude smaller than the fastest times for first passage to the binding sites , @xmath76 . because @xmath77 , we can relate @xmath40 to the distribution @xmath78 , the probability density of finding the myov free end at position @xmath79 once the system has reached equilibrium after leg detachment , @xmath80 where @xmath81 @xmath82/s is the diffusion constant of the myov head , estimated using the program hydropro  @xcite applied to the pdb structure 1w8j  @xcite .",
    "the above equation transforms the dynamical problem of diffusive search time into one of calculating the equilibrium end - point distribution of a tethered , two - legged semiflexible polymer structure . by adapting a mean field theory for invididual semiflexible chains  @xcite , and noting that contour fluctuations are small in the regime @xmath65",

    "together with eq .  , we have a complete description of @xmath40 as a function of load and the myov structural parameters .",
    "if we assume that the other events in the mechanochemical cycle  hydrolysis and th / lh detachment  are poisson processes with respective rates @xmath49 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , the probability of each kinetic pathway can also be derived , together with related quantities like mean run length and velocity .",
    "the full set of analytical equations for our model is summarized in table  s1 of the si .      to gain an understanding of how the structural features of myov influence its motility , it is instructive to start with @xmath84 .",

    "[ times]a , b show the first passage times @xmath40 as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath19 respectively with the other parameters being fixed at their table  1 values .",
    "because of the power stroke constraint , there is an asymmetry in the first passage times : @xmath85 because the center of the @xmath78 distribution is shifted toward the forward binding site at @xmath86 . at @xmath84 the average @xmath87-axis location of the free leg , @xmath88 ,",

    "larger @xmath101 means a smaller @xmath102 and greater asymmetry .",

    "the end - tangent constraint does not have a significant effect if the polymer leg is too flexible .",
    "thus , both @xmath19 and @xmath4 have to be large to create significant asymmetry . in the discussion we will highlight the relationship between @xmath101 and important mechanical and energy scales in the system , including the overall compliance of the leg and the energy expended by the power stroke .    the asymmetry factor @xmath102 influences kinetic pathway probabilities . at the end of each waiting stage",
    ", there is a probability of making a forward step ( @xmath103 ) , a backward step ( @xmath104 ) , an l foot stomp ( @xmath105 ) , and a t foot stomp ( @xmath106 ) .",

    "<S> our work supplements the reaction network with an explicit treatment of the diffusive search , which has been studied using insightful brownian dynamics simulations of forward stepping in myov  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important aspect of our theory is that it allows us to tackle not just forward steps but the full complexity of foot stomping and backstepping across the entire force spectrum up to the stall point . in our framework , the load dependence of the myov behavior enters naturally , as pulling on the molecule shifts the speed and likelihood of the detached head reaching the forward or backward binding sites . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between the time scales of first passage to the sites , and how they compare to the detachment rates of the heads , determines the partitioning of the kinetic pathways . </S>",

    "<S> we also explore more broadly the design space of myov structural parameters , allowing us to predict the essential requirements for the observed dynamical behavior , and to answer the following questions . </S>",
    "<S> is the structure of the motor dictated by certain natural constraints ? </S>",
    "<S> how robust is the motility of myov to perturbations in the parameters ? </S>",
    "<S> what are the relative contributions of head chemistry ( resulting from changes in the nucleotide states ) and the structural features to the measured stall force ? the answers to these questions , which are provided in terms of phase diagrams , lead to testable predictions . </S>"
