    "with an estimated undecelerated explosion date around 1680 @xcite , cassiopeia a ( cas a ) is one of the youngest known galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "it is also one of the few historic remnants with a secure supernova ( sn ) subtype through the detection of optical and infrared light echoes of its initial supernova outburst @xcite .",
    "optical spectra of its light echo show cas a to be the remnant of a core - collapse type iib supernova event with an optical spectrum at maximum light similar to sn 1993j in m81 .",
    "as indicated by the slow dense wind into which cas a s forward shock is expanding @xcite , the cas  a progenitor was probably a red supergiant with a mass of 1525m@xmath6 that may have lost much of its hydrogen envelope to a binary interaction @xcite .",
    "viewed in x - rays , the remnant consists of a bright , line - emitting shell arising from reverse shocked ejecta rich in o , si , s , ar , ca , and fe @xcite .",
    "small knots and filamentary regions of x - ray emitting ejecta have been observed to change in intensity and structure over time , indicating the location of recently shocked , ionizing ejecta @xcite .",
    "exterior to this shell are faint x - ray filaments which mark the current location of the snr s @xmath7 5000 km s@xmath4 expanding forward shock @xcite .",
    "this emission is largely nonthermal but can include faint line emission from shocked circumstellar material ( csm ; * ? ? ?",
    "this outer nonthermal x - ray emission is fading with time @xcite while the bulk of the remnant s bright thermal emission arising from shocked ejecta has remained relatively steady over the last few decades .",
    "the remnant s optical and infrared emissions trace the location of its denser debris ( @xmath8 @xmath1 ; @xcite ) which in some places is co - spatial with lower density and more diffuse x - ray emitting material .",
    "the bulk of cas  a s optical and near - infrared emission consists of a v@xmath9 = @xmath10 to @xmath11 km s@xmath4 expanding shell of knots , condensations , and filaments which lack any h@xmath12 emission @xcite .",
    "a few dozen semi - stationary condensations known as qsfs which do exhibit strong h@xmath12 and [ ] @xmath136548 , 6583 emissions with prevalently negative radial velocities of 0 to @xmath14 km s@xmath4 appear to be pre - sn , circumstellar mass - loss material @xcite .    in the picture of an inhomogeneous sn debris field with a range of ejecta densities and component dimensions , strong and widespread correlations between",
    "low density x - ray emitting material and small dense optically emitting knots are not expected ; optical emission arises from gas with electron temperatures of around @xmath15 30,000 k while x - rays arise from material shock heated to several million degrees k. indeed , one generally sees only a weak spatial correlation of bright fine scale x - ray and optical features in images of cas  a taken at similar epochs @xcite .",
    "but there are exceptions .",
    "for example , while noting only broad optical / x - ray emission coincidences in the remnant s northern regions in the 1979 _ einstein _ image , @xcite cited an especially good correspondence between optical , x - ray , and radio emission in the bright optical filament 1 of @xcite .",
    "however , in places where dense optical emitting knots are embedded within or associated with a much lower density component there might be a close optical / x - ray emission correlation .",
    "the resemblance of the remnant s morphology in the optical and si and s x - ray emission lines is suggestive of at least some spatial coincidence @xcite .",
    "furthermore , indications of ejecta knot mass stripping in cas a have been reported @xcite and such trailing material , if of the right density and mass , could lead to detectable associated x - ray emission downstream .",
    "lastly , different excitation timescales between optical and x - ray emissions might lead to discernible time lags between the onset of strong optical and strong x - ray emissions .    here",
    "we present the results of an investigation into x - ray and optical correlations that may be related to such factors through a comparative survey of cas a s optical and x - ray emission evolution over the last 30 years .",
    "the observations and results are described in @xmath162 and @xmath163 , with a modeling analysis described in @xmath164 .",
    "a summary of our findings and conclusions is given in @xmath165 .",
    "the earliest x - ray images of cas  a with angular resolution capable of resolving features at scales @xmath15 5@xmath17 were obtained in 1979 with the _ einstein _ satellite and its high resolution imager ( hri ) .",
    "details of the _ einstein _ telescope and hri detector can be found in @xcite .",
    "the _ einstein _",
    "hri has little spectral resolution over the 0.14.5 kev bandwidth of the telescope , and hence we used the broadband image without filtering any pulse height channels .",
    "cas  a was not imaged again at high angular resolution until 19951996 , with the _ rosat _ hri , in the 0.22.4 kev band @xcite . like the _ einstein _ observations",
    ", we do not attempt any energy filtering of the _ rosat _ hri data . due to the high column density towards cas a",
    ", the x - ray emission in this bandpass is dominated by thermal emission from at @xmath7 1.85 kev .",
    "more recently , cas  a has been extensively observed with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory using the acis - s ccd detector .",
    "we summarize those observations ( as well as the prior x - ray observations ) used in this paper in table  [ tab : obs ] . since we are looking for correlations between cas a s x - ray and optical emissions and because a majority of archival optical images were particularly sensitive to [ ] @xmath136716,6731 emissions we focused our attention on the he - like ion emission of silicon in the _ chandra _ x - ray data which should emphasize s + si - rich ejecta .",
    "we reprocessed all of the _ chandra _ acis observations of cas a using _ ciao _ 4.4.1 and caldb 4.5.1 and then created exposure corrected images using the _ ciao _ script fluximage .",
    "continuum image maps for the energy ranges 1.61.7 kev and 1.952.05 kev were generated , and we used them to estimate the continuum emission under the he  like silicon triplet .",
    "we then computed an exposure corrected image for from 1.751.94 kev ( centered on 1.85 kev ) and subtracted the continuum emission image from that .",
    "this produces a map of emission that is mostly from .",
    "we did this for each _ chandra _ observation listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the resulting x - ray images were examined for time variable features in the form of the emergence or disappearance of individual knots and filaments . while there is evidence for variability in x - ray emission over short time scales @xcite , here we investigated the time when certain x - ray knots first became visible in order to compare with the formation of coincident optical emission , where present .    for comparisons between _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ , and _",
    "observations we required a different strategy .",
    "since we are unable to energy filter the _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ observations , we chose to approximately match the _",
    "observations to those hri observations by energy filtering the acis - s data between 0.14.5 kev .",
    "however , the _ chandra _ response below 0.3 kev is poorly characterized , so we only filter to 0.3 kev , and in any event low energy x - rays and xuv emission from cas a are absorbed by a high column density ( i.e. , low energy x - rays from cas a do not contribute much to the overall detected flux ) .",
    "several regions or features which showed significant flux variability using the 1979 _ einstein _ image , the 1995 _ rosat _ image , and the calibrated 2000 , 2004 , 2007 , 2010 , and 2013 _ chandra _ images ( energy filtered between 0.34.5 kev ) were identified and investigated . using 5@xmath17 radius apertures",
    ", we extracted total counts from each data set for each region and compute the detector count rate , using the exposure times listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "@xcite presented maps of the fitted x - ray temperature and absorbing column towards cas a. for the purposes of this study , we assume that on average , the column towards cas a is n@xmath18 @xmath19 1.5@xmath2010@xmath21 h atoms @xmath22 , and @xmath23 t @xmath19 1.8 kev . using ` webpimms ` , we converted the detector count rates into absorbed source fluxes , assuming a solar abundance apec model with the above parameters .",
    "the results for five features discussed in   [ sub : smallscale ] are listed in table  [ tab : xrayflux ] .",
    "we note that while the apec model does not accurately reflect the conditions we are investigating ( it being a model for a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ) , we are using it to compute flux changes which give rise to the observed changes in count rate .      for optical observations of cas  a ,",
    "we have made use of the extensive archival collection of palomar observatory 200 inch ( 5 m ) photographic plates taken of the remnant between 1951 and 1989 and made available though the assistance of s. van den bergh .",
    "added to this data set , are several more recent ccd images of cas a taken with the mdm 1.3 m and 2.4 m telescopes obtained between 1992 and 1999 along with _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images of the remnant obtained from 2000 to 2011 ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the majority of the optical imaging data are the palomar 5 m images , which comprise the earliest and deepest images taken of cas a. these form a unique image set recording the remnant s optical appearance soon after its 1948 discovery via radio observations @xcite and before the advent of high efficiency electronic detectors in the 1980s .",
    "these plates , @xmath24 7 inches in size , were all taken at the palomar 5 m prime focus usually employing the ross corrector plate and have a plate scale of @xmath25 per mm .",
    "filter and photographic emulsion details for each plate used or examined for this study are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "these photographic plates , after being manually cleaned of surface dust , were digitized using the high - speed digitizing scanning machine dasch @xcite at the harvard ",
    "smithsonian center for astrophysics .",
    "this scanner consists of a precision ( 0.2 @xmath26 m ) x - y table , a red led array , and a 4k @xmath20 4k ccd camera , and is capable of scanning two 8 @xmath20 10 inch plates in less than one minute .",
    "it can record the full dynamic range of the photographic negative ( plate ) , and with its camera pixels just @xmath27 m in size is able to record plate details finer that the emulsion grains .",
    "output is a set of overlapping frames which are then mosaiced together to form a single image of each frame .",
    "approximate world coordinates ( wcs ) were determined for each plate using astrometric solutions done with an automated procedure using software routines in wcstools @xcite .",
    "more accurate wcs image coordinates were subsequently applied using usno ucac3 catalog stars @xcite with a resulting estimated accuracy of @xmath28 near plate center .",
    "although the dasch scanner is capable of generating accurate photometric data from photographic plates , we have not attempted to flux calibrate these images to the ccd images in our data set .",
    "this was viewed as an enormous undertaking ( if even possible ) and well beyond the scope and needs of this study . aside from the lack of calibration plates taken from the same emulsion plate batches used for each of these images ,",
    "the heterogeneous variety of photographic plate emulsions used over several decades ( 19511989 ) , different chemical developers , development times and procedures means that the ` characteristic curve ' of log(exposure ) versus log(plate density ) is likely to be different for every single plate ( for further details see @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the photographic characteristic curve issue , calibrated optical magnitudes of the remnant s emission line ejecta knots off the palomar plates using a catalog of known magnitudes by assuming a non - linear function like that done for the similarly scanned harvard college observatory plate collection was also deemed not possible @xcite .",
    "the palomar plates taken of cas  a were obtained through a variety of uncalibrated broadband filters , and this taken together with the emission line nature of the remnant s optical flux , i.e. , unknown relative and possibly variable [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] emission line strengths within these filter passbands , greatly limits the meaning of the resulting photographic density to optical flux conversion .",
    "the problem of measuring the equivalent of broad passband bvri or sloan filter optical magnitudes of cas  a s emission knots even applies , although to a lesser extent , to modern ccd images .",
    "the remnant s optical emission spectrum varies greatly across filaments and knots @xcite and changes in the relative line strengths for individual ejecta knots have been observed , especially for ejecta rapid flux changes such as recently shocked ejecta knots @xcite .",
    "consequently , we have limited our optical / x - ray comparison survey only to those few coincident x - ray and optical emission knots or regions which exhibited obvious changes in flux .",
    "given these severe constraints , our estimated optical flux changes using the palomar plates are limited only to gross changes in optical brightness for specific regions or features . because magnitude values for late - type stars m@xmath29 = 11.5 to 17.3 ) in the cas a field made by @xcite",
    "were saturated on the palomar plates we calibrated these images using usno a2 red r2 magnitudes for a set of stars around the remnant in the magnitude range of 18.5 to 19.5 . for red emulsion images using rg2 , rg630 , and rg645 filters ,",
    "the internal consistency was a relatively modest @xmath30 mag given the uncalibrated plate material .",
    "however , given the highly inhomogeneous optical image data , namely archival palomar plate material , r band ccd images , and _ hst _ images taken with three different detectors and filter combinations ( wfpc2 w675f , acs f625w + f775w , and wfc3 f098 m ) , we were unable to correlate optical fluxes of specific regions with meaningful accuracy .",
    "the basic problem is two - fold : 1 ) the different data sets employed different detectors having different wavelength sensitivities , and 2 ) a wide range of filters were used which either do not overlap each other , cover the same set of important emission lines , or have similar transmission at these line emission wavelengths .",
    "this situation made an accurate assessment of a feature s optical flux changes not possible .",
    "instead we present optical images of specific regions of interest where a qualitative assessment of a feature s variability can be made in relation to other nearby remnant emission regions .      for our comparison study of cas a s x - ray and optical emission structures , we chose to concentrate on red passband optical images .",
    "this decision was driven in part by the greater quality and quantity of palomar red plates of cas  a ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) and the increased remnant s structure when viewed at longer wavelengths due to more red line emissions than in the blue .",
    "cas a s blue optical line emissions are dominated by [ ] @xmath134959,5007 emission , whereas at longer wavelengths the remnant s emissions arises from a larger number of strong emission lines including [ ] @xmath136300,6364 , [ ] @xmath136716,6731 , [ ] @xmath317135 , and [ ] @xmath137319,7330 .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : blue_vs_red ] , while the remnant s structure changes substantially between 1951 and 2004 and bright blue and red structures are consistent with one another , there are significant differences especially along the southern limb . even in the northern regions where they are similar in gross morphology , remnant features are brighter and better detected in the red .",
    "such differences are also due in part to the considerable interstellar reddening toward the remnant ( @xmath32 = 46 mag ; @xcite ) which greatly weakens the remnant s blue emission features . for these reasons",
    ", we focused most of our attention on the more complete data set of red optical images when comparing the remnant s optical and x - ray emissions .",
    "spatial correlations between cas a s optical and x - ray emission are generally not strong .",
    "large scale emission correlations that do exist are mainly confined to the northern and northeastern regions @xcite .",
    "this lack of strong correlation may be due in part to the relatively high and varied extinction along the line of sight to cas a , especially along its western limb @xcite .",
    "we have attempted to mitigate some of the effects of this absorption by using red and near infrared images sensitive to the remnant s strong [ ] @xmath136716 , 6731 and [ ] @xmath139069 , 9531 line emissions and by examining the remnant s x - ray emission from at @xmath15 1.8 kev which is not strongly affected by interstellar absorption .",
    "in addition , by focusing on emission from silicon ( in x - rays ) and sulfur ( in optical ) , one is sampling ejecta with like abundances , as these two elements are both synthesized during explosive oxygen burning . using sulfur as a proxy for silicon",
    "is confirmed in the equivalent width maps of cas a presented in @xcite . using these x - ray and optical data sets",
    ", we discuss below our findings regarding large and small scale optical / x - ray comparisons , possible time delays between the appearance of optical and x - ray emissions , and selected regions that show no corresponding optical or x - ray emission .      from the first high - resolution x - ray image of cas",
    "a taken with the _ einstein _ satellite in 1979 , it was clear that cas a s x - ray and optical morphologies exhibited significant large scale differences .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ xray_opt_comp ] , where we contrast the remnant s x - ray and optical emissions in the late 1970s and some 25 years later in 2004 .    in the upper two panels of figure  [ xray_opt_comp ]",
    ", we show the 1979 _ einstein _ hri broadband image of cas  a along side of a deep 1976 palomar hale 5 m red optical image .",
    "while there is some correlation between certain emission regions seen in the 1976 optical and 1979 x - ray images especially along the remnant s northern limb , there is a poor large - scale optical / x - ray emission correlation over much of the remnant , especially notable in the remnant s south , east , and west quadrants .",
    "most obvious is the lack of bright optical emission in the 1976 palomar image coincident with the x - ray bright eastern and southeastern limbs , and the virtual absence of any optical emission along the remnant s western limb , where moderately bright x - ray emission is present .",
    "there is a better correlation between x - ray and optical emissions in 2004 _ chandra _ and _ hubble space telescope _ images . in the lower panels of figure  [ xray_opt_comp ]",
    ", we show a 2004 continuum subtracted x - ray image of cas a taken with _",
    "acis - s on the left and a 2004 _ hubble space telescope _",
    "acs image on the right where we have co - added the f625w and f775w filter images to simulate a broad passband band r filter image approximating the red 1976 palomar image .",
    "while there is now optical emission along the remnant s southwestern limb which matches the x - ray , there is still little optical emission in the southeast where the remnant s x - ray emission is especially strong and extensive .",
    "these similarities and differences can be more readily visible in figure  [ fig : comp_color ] where we present a color composite of 2004 optical ( red ) and x - ray ( green ) emissions .    the southeastern region of cas",
    "a has consistently shown especially poor x - ray / optical emission correspondence . in order to examine this region more closely ,",
    "we show in figure  [ southeast ] an enlarged comparison of 2004 x - ray and optical emissions along the remnant s southeastern limb ( upper panels ) along with a color composite of these x - ray ( green ) and optical ( red ) images shown in the lower panels .",
    "features with coincident x - ray and optical emissions appear yellow .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , one finds only sparse spatial correlations between optical and x - ray emission features in this portion of the remnant .",
    "in fact , the brightest x - ray feature in this region , marked by the white boxed region and shown enlarged in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ southeast ] , lies substantially offset from bright neighboring optical features . in @xmath164 below we will discuss possible explanations for such anti - correlations .",
    "it is important to note that unlike much of its x - ray emission , the remnant s overall optical emission has shown substantial changes over the last few decades , becoming both brighter and more pervasive .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig:60yrs ] where we present x - ray and optical images of the remnant over time spans of 31 and 60 years , respectively . in the top row",
    "we show the 1979 _ einstein _ image , the 1995 rosat image along with a november 2010 ( listed here as 2011 ) x - ray image of cas a smoothed to match the angular resolution of the earlier images . in the 12 lower panels ,",
    "we show optical red passband images of cas  a from 1951 to 2011 .",
    "this figure shows that while cas a s overall x - ray emission has undergone only fairly minor large scale changes over the last three decades , its optical appearance has gone from one of faint and sparse emission structures , to a bright and extensive emission morphology in 60 years .",
    "although the optical observations shown in figure  [ fig:60yrs ] cover a time span that is roughly twice that of the x - ray images , it is apparent that the bulk of the remnant s gross x - ray emission evolves on a slower timescale than its optical emission .",
    "that is to say , cas a looks fairly similar in 2011 as its did in 1979 when viewed in x - rays , whereas the remnant s optical appearance has changed substantially in many regions on timescales of a decade or less .      at _",
    "chandra s _ acis resolution , @xcite found a significant fraction of cas a s x - ray emission consists of knots or small - scale clumps .",
    "they noted that most of these clumpy x - ray features do not coincide with the remnant s high - velocity optical ejecta knots and concluded that they represent only mildly over - dense regions rather than true , high density ejecta knots .",
    "however , there are a number of small - scale features where optical and x - ray emissions do appear to positionally coincide , especially in cases of recently brightened optical and x - ray ejecta clumps .",
    "below , we present and discuss a few of such cases where it appears that the remnant s advancing reverse shock has resulted in correlated optical and x - ray changes and we explore both the spatial and temporal properties of such features .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp_color_xray ] shows the locations of five small - scale features which have exhibited significant brightening in both x - rays and in the optical within the last few decades .",
    "these features , marked as a ",
    "e on the 2004 _ chandra _ image , appear to be either absent or weak on earlier einstein or rosat images yet currently rank among the remnant s brightest small - scale x - ray features . the x - ray flux evolution of these five regions are listed in table 2 , shown in figures 711 , and briefly discussed below .",
    "feature a : the upper row of panels in figure  [ feature_a ] show 1979 , 1995 , 2000 , and 2011 x - ray images of a region , marked by @xmath33 diameter red circles in the remnant s north - central regions which brightened in x - rays between 1995 and 2000 ( see table 2 ) . similar circles in the lower panels",
    "mark the coincident optical ejecta knot seen in images taken between 1976 and 2011 . whereas by 2000 this feature was one of cas  a s brightest x - ray emission knots , the coincident optical emission is weak and unremarkable in its optical emission from 1992 up to 2011 . while virtually absent in the palomar image prior to 1972 and greatly complicated by the presence of a nearby and stationary qsf in the earliest images , the knot had an estimated r2 magnitude of 20.9 in 1976 but 20.1 and 19.4 in 1996 and 1999 respectively , in line with its brightening in x - rays .",
    "feature b : considerable clumpy emission is seen in the 2004 _ chandra _ image of the remnant s north - central region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_color_xray ] ) . enlargements of four _ chandra _ x - ray images taken between 2000 and 2013 centered on one of these emission knots labeled feature b are shown in the upper panels of figure  [ feature_b ] , along with corresponding optical images covering the epochs 1999 to 2011 .",
    "like that seen for feature a , this region exhibited a significant x - ray and optical brightening after 2004 and will be discussed further in @xmath163.3.1 below .",
    "feature c : figure  [ feature_c ] shows a comparison of an x - ray and optical emission for the extended feature ` c ' located along the remnant s northernmost rim .",
    "these images reveal a dramatic increase in x - ray brightness between 2000 and 2013 preceded by a sharp increase in coincident optical emission between 1992 and 1999 .",
    "the feature s x - ray emission was relatively weak in 2000 but by 2011 was one of cas  a s brightest emission knots .",
    "however , unlike the two previous cases , its coincident optical emission is relatively bright although not ranking among the remnant s brightest optical features . also , the evolution of the x - ray emission in this feature appears to follow that seen in the optical but delayed by several years .",
    "for example , the feature s x - ray emission was only apparent in 2000 whereas optically it became detectable by the late 1980s , showed marked increases in 1992 and 1999 mirrored later in the x - rays between 2004 and 2007 .",
    "feature d : this southern limb x - ray emission clump , shown in figure  [ feature_d ] consists of a small complex of knots which became bright in both x - rays and optically after 2000 . by 2004 , this feature was one of the brightest x - ray knot complexes along the remnant s southern limb .",
    "the feature s morphology is somewhat extended and showed significant changes between 2004 and 2007 .",
    "feature e : located along cas a s western limb , this feature exhibited a dramatic increase in optical flux after 1996 .",
    "its x - ray flux also increased after 2000 , showing a second sharp increase in x - ray flux after 2010 .",
    "there is some indication of a time delay of around three to five years between the onsets of optical and x - ray brightening .",
    "however , this is hard to confirm , because like feature d , this is a complex of emission knots and clumps with similar but not exactly matching optical and x - ray morphologies .",
    "the optical morphology possibly tying these five x - ray / optical co - spatial emission regions together is examined in figure  [ fig : region_a2e ] .",
    "as shown in these march 2004 _ hst _ images , all five small - scale regions ( a through e ) exhibit a structure consisting of many small bright knots plus considerable surrounding diffuse emission .",
    "a similar small - scale structure is also seen for the x - ray bright northeastern feature known as `` filament 1 '' @xcite and noted by @xcite as a case of especially good x - ray / optical co - spatial emission .",
    "the combination of both a highly inhomogeneous density structure and the recent passage of the remnant s reverse shock may account for the co - spatial x - ray and optical emission correlations observed for these regions .",
    "in addition to co - spatial x - ray and optical emission , we also found positional and temporal offsets between cas a s x - ray and optical emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp_color_ne ] shows an enlargement of the color x - ray and optical composite shown in figure 3 but now covering just the north - central portion of the remnant .",
    "this region was selected because it contains several coincident small scale optical / x - ray knots .",
    "two emission features of special interest are marked by white circles .",
    "feature 1 is an example of a positional offset between associated clumpy x - ray and optical emissions , while feature 2 is a case of relatively bright x - ray emission patch having no corresponding present optical emission but coincident with an optical feature visible decades prior but no longer easily detected .",
    "we begin by presenting evidence for small - scale spatial offsets between a clump s x - ray and optical emission .",
    "the small knot marked as feature 1 is one such example .",
    "it consists of a small ( @xmath34 ) optically bright knot similar to several other knots located to the north and northwest of it and seemingly forming a chain of optically bright knots each with some coincident or nearly coincident x - ray emission .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , the optical knot marked as feature 1 exhibits some associated x - ray emission but which is offset slightly to the west .",
    "this positional offset is examined in greater detail in figure  [ fig : region1 ] where we show 2000 through 2010 x - ray and optical images along side of a color x - ray / optical composite .",
    "the knot s optical and x - ray emission fluxes increase substantially over this period . at all four epochs between 2000 and 2010 ,",
    "the knot s associated x - ray emission is not precisely coincident with the knot s optical emission , instead offset by a few arcseconds to the west .",
    "this is much greater than possible alignment wcs errors between the optical and x - ray images .    a clue to the nature of such x - ray /",
    "optical emission offsets may come from the positional offset case seen in a line of apparently recently shocked ejecta located near the remnant s south central region , shown in figure  [ fig : parenthesis ] . comprising part of small arcs of filaments and referred to as the ` parentheses ' by @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "this emission arc lies on the facing ( blueshifted ) hemisphere of cas  a @xcite and has been interpreted as the walls of a reverse shocked ejecta cavity @xcite .",
    "the morphology of this filamentary arc suggests the remnant s reverse shock has passed over a line of dense ejecta clumps , leading to rayleigh - taylor head - tail structures along with some trailing diffuse emission seen visible in the _ hst _ acs 2004 and wfc3 2011 images .",
    "associated x - ray emission can be seen offset and west ( i.e. , behind ) the line of optical knots again by a few arc seconds ( @xmath35 cm ) .",

    "the density of ejecta clumps embedded within a low density envelope may not instantaneously change between the diffuse and clumpy components .",
    "we will argue below that such low density material surrounding dense knots may be responsible for some population of correlated x - ray and optical structures identified in the images described in @xmath163 .",

    "we used a one dimensional numerical hydrodynamics code to study the evolution of the electron temperature and ionization of the diffuse component of the ejecta .",
    "this code is based on the numerical code vh-1 developed by @xcite to which we have added a non - equilibrium ionization calculation and prescription for electron heating , similar to that described in @xcite although we do not consider cosmic - ray losses here .",
    "@xcite recently completed a census of the x - ray emitting ejecta in cas a , and we have used their results for our one - dimensional hydrodynamical model .",
    "we model cas a s diffuse ejecta as an @xmath90 = 10 power law in velocity ( @xmath91 @xmath77 @xmath92 ) expanding into an isotropic stellar wind ( @xmath93 @xmath77 @xmath94 ) and assume 3m@xmath6 of ejecta and an explosion energy of 2@xmath2010@xmath95 erg .",
    "for the progenitor s stellar wind , we assume @xmath96 = 10 km s@xmath4 and @xmath97 = 2@xmath2010@xmath98 m@xmath6 yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the exact choice of explosion and wind parameters affects the final ionization state and dynamics of the gas but we are mainly looking for a trend in how the optical emission from dense ejecta clumps relates to the x - ray emission from a co - moving diffuse component .",
    "consequently , we are not too concerned with the exact details , only in whether the thermalization timescale for electrons and the ionization timescale to he - like states is similar to the clump destruction and radiative cooling timescales .    in figure  [ fig : model ]",
    ", we plot the ionization age and electron temperature of shocked ejecta behind the reverse shock as a function of when the ejecta was shocked .",
    "as seen in this plot , electrons quickly thermalize to x - ray emitting temperatures , while only after some @xmath15 20 yr does the ionization parameter becomes large enough that emission lines from he  like ions become important .",
    "thus , at least phenomenologically , significant x - ray emission at locations where optical emission first becomes bright is consistent with an ejecta structure where dense clumps of ejecta are embedded in a more diffuse medium .    in the above model",
    ", we make no assumptions about the elemental abundance in the ejecta , and use cosmic abundances .",
    "however , since cas a s ejecta are highly metal rich , each ionization will , in fact , lead to a higher electron density per unit time than in the cosmic abundance case .",
    "additionally , since the electron heating is @xmath77 z@xmath99 , the heating rate in a metal rich plasma will be greater and result in higher electron temperatures .",
    "thus , the parameters shown in figure  [ fig : model ] represent lower limits on the true values . in the sections that follow below ,",
    "we describe how the observed x - ray / optical emission phenomena presented in @xmath163 can fit within the basic framework described above .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sub : temp_delays ] , several recently shocked features exhibit apparent time delays between the rise of optical and x - ray emission ( e.g. , features c and e ) .",
    "a particularly interesting example is that of feature 2 in the northern portion of the remnant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_color_ne ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : region2 ] , a faint patch of optical emission appeared around 1972 , became more easily visible in 1976 and 1983 palomar images but then gradually faded , becoming nearly undetectable in deep 1992 and 1996 images . at this location , 2000 and 2004 red passband _",

    "in contrast , as shown in the lower right frame of figure  [ fig : region2 ] , one sees relatively strong x - ray emission at this location in the _ chandra _ image starting in 2000 and in all subsequent images up to the present .",
    "one can interpret such emission changes within the framework of a cluster of relatively low density ejecta clumps interacting with the reverse shock some 2040 years ago .",
    "a shock is driven into a region of moderately dense ejecta giving rise to detectable but nonetheless relatively weak optical emission . at the same time , a larger region of lower density ejecta associated with these optical clumps is eventually heated to @xmath15 10@xmath100 k and ionized to he and h  like charge states .",
    "the timescale for this process is some 30  40 years , roughly similar to that seen for feature 2 , and envisioned in figure  [ fig : ejecta ] . during that time , the optical clumps cool radiatively , also on a timescale of about 20  30 years , thus explaining the near disappearance optically by the late 1990s .",
    "there are numerous places in the remnant where this is a clear offset or separation between a feature s optical and its x - ray emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : region1 ] presents one such example . another is shown in figure  [ fig : parenthesis ] and it is this line of optical knots that may give us a clue to what is causing this particular morphology here and elsewhere .",
    "figure  [ fig : parenthesis ] shows a curved line of optical emission along with displaced associated x - ray emission .",
    "these optical knots lie on the facing hemisphere of the remnant @xcite .",
    "we have drawn in the apparent direction of motion in which the reverse shock is traveling for the line of emission knots .",
    "the morphology of the line of optical emission knots would suggest that the reverse shock has recently passed over them but their associated x - ray emission lies to the right ( west ) and behind the optical emission and thus closer to the reverse shock s current location than the line of optical emission knots .",
    "we propose that such x - ray / optical offsets is , in some cases , generated by shock induced mass ablation from dense optically emitting ejecta knots . in figure",
    "[ fig : opt_tails ] , we present a schematic of how this x - ray / optical offset morphology can be produced . in the first frame ,",
    "the reverse shock and the ejecta are seen to be separate . in the second frame ,",
    "the reverse shock encounters dense ejecta knots , which are shocked and become bright in optical emission .",
    "some of the knot material is ablated by the reverse shock , and advects away from the knots , remaining closer to the reverse shock ( third frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_tails ] ) .",
    "this material is of a lower density than in the knots and so is shock heated to higher temperatures where it can become visible in x - rays .",
    "the separation between x - ray and optical emission in figures  [ fig : region1 ] and  [ fig : parenthesis ] is @xmath40 2.5@xmath17 .",
    "this corresponds to an advection timescale of 10 years for the dense knots .",
    "it is likely that in these scenarios , the x - ray emission seen at the reverse shock is not directly associated with material from the knots that are observed at the same epoch but possibly from knots that previously encountered and were ablated by the reverse shock . in any event ,",
    "the low density component at the reverse shock can be `` refreshed '' by recently ablated material .",
    "a similar set of mass ablation phenomena appears to occur in the ne `` jet '' of cas a. here , there is substantial evidence for high velocity ejecta bullets with space velocities between 8000 and 14,000 km s@xmath4 @xcite",
    ". as they move away from the remnant s expansion center , they are shock heated via their interaction with the surrounding circumstellar material .",
    "some mass is stripped off these ejecta clumps due to kelvin - helmholtz instabilities along the sides of the bullets leading to faint optical emission trails seen in _",
    ". this stripped material will be of lower density and consequently shock heated to high temperatures , and becoming x - ray bright @xcite while lagging behind the optically bright material . in both sets of cases ,",
    "a positional offset occurs due to mass ablation of less dense material from the ejecta knots ( bullets ) which is then shock heated to higher x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "as described in @xmath163.2 , certain regions are bright in both optical and x - ray emission . these cases may be instances where optical clumps are embedded within or associated with an extended , lower density medium like that seen in figure  [ fig : region_a2e ] .",
    "both the dense and less dense regions are shocked at the same time .",
    "the optical emission becomes bright and as it advects away from the reverse shock , the lower density region becomes bright as well , in x - rays .",
    "this is shown schematically in figure  [ fig : ejecta ] .",
    "what differentiates this scenario from that presented in the previous section may be that the maximum density of the optically emitting material is possibly lower than in the very dense knots , and the contrast between the dense and diffuse components is less ( or the transition between dense and diffuse components more gradual ) .",
    "it could also occur if we are viewing shocked ejecta with significant mass ablation along our line of sight .",
    "we note that figure  [ fig : ejecta ] can qualitatively describe both regions that show coincident x - ray and optical emission , as well as regions that show a time delay between x - ray and optical emission , if the density contrasts and knot envelope structure are appropriately chosen",
    ".      just as some regions have coincident optical and x - ray emission , there are other regions in the cas a remnant that exhibit emission only in either optical or x - ray bands .",
    "these regions do not seem to have obvious positional or temporal offsets which might be attributed to ablation of dense ejecta knots .",
    "one such region lies in the remnant s northwest limb ( fig .",
    "[ figure_nw_arc ] ) where the advance of cas a s reverse shock front can be readily identified in optical emission @xcite . between 1976 and 1992 ,",
    "the optical emission from this region has brightened substantially .",
    "this is in contrast to the x - ray emission ( upper panels of fig .",
    "[ figure_nw_arc ] ) , which show no clearly discernible change between 1979 and 2011 .",
    "@xcite estimated preshock densities in this region of 25  2500 @xmath1 .",
    "ram pressure equilibrium thus requires that the velocity of this shocked high density component to be @xmath40 20200 km s@xmath4 . with these densities , it is not surprising that there is no correlated x - ray / optical emission in this region especially since it has evolved into a nearly continuous filament of optical emission .",
    "in contrast to the optically bright region in the northwest with no corresponding x - ray emission , a completely opposite situation exists in the northeast near the base of the remnant s ne jet . shown in figure  [ fig : eastregions ] is a region of brightening x - ray emission with no corresponding optical emission . between 2000 and 2010",
    ", the filament has brightened substantially , with little or no corresponding optical emission seen . using _",
    "observations between 2000 and 2012 , we modeled both the si - k 1.752.0 kev line flux and line centroid , and found that the flux has increased by nearly a factor of 3 in 12 years , and the line centroid has increased by 10 ev over the same period , indicating an ionizing plasma ( see table  [ tab : xray_rs ] ) .    while these two cases are quite different , the underlying cause of the differences may again be attributed to ejecta density . in the case of the x - ray emission in the northeast , lack of optical emission here could be due to the ejecta density being too low ( @xmath69 1 @xmath1 ) resulting in a high velocity of the shocked ejecta ( probably several thousand kilometers per second ) thus making the conditions not conducive to the formation of optically bright filaments .",
    "a similar situation may help explain the copious x - ray emission in the east and southeast ( fig .",
    "[ southeast ] ) where one sees hardly any coincident optical emission .",
    "@xcite noted the presence of plumes and rings of ejecta in cas a. in the east / southeast , the plume of ejecta here might be of low density or at least any inhomogeneities might be smoothed out by hydrodynamical effects and thus optical emission from dense knots is not expected .",
    "the northwest line of optical filaments shown in figure  [ figure_nw_arc ] presents the exact opposite scenario as that seen in the southeast . in this region , it is likely that the reverse shock is currently interacting with a nearly continuous sheet of relatively high density material .",
    "the shocks driven into this sheet are not strong enough to produce x - ray emission but does result in a nearly continuous filament of optical emission .",
    "a large fraction of cas a s ejecta likely exists as a low density , diffuse component with densities @xmath15 1 @xmath1 .",
    "we suggest that embedded within this low density , diffuse component are clumps of varying densities , many with surrounding lower density envelope - like structures .",
    "dense knots with relatively thin envelopes ( where the transition from the diffuse to clumped ejecta is akin to a step function ) give rise to a head  tail like structure after reverse shock passage , resulting in the shocked optical knots appearing downstream of associated x - ray emission which is located closer to the shock ; e.g. , as in region  1 , shown in figure  [ fig : region1 ] or in the `` parentheses '' seen in figure  [ fig : parenthesis ] , and idealized in the schematic seen in figure  [ fig : opt_tails ] .",
    "there are also dense ejecta clumps that are surrounded by a much broader , yet lower density , envelope ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : region_a2e ] ) . in these cases ,",
    "the optical knots and x - ray emitting envelope remain co - spatial , though there may be time delays as the optical emission brightens and fades , and then the x - ray emission subsequently brightens . finally , there are regions where there is either only optical emission , and no x - ray emission , or visa versa ( see figs .  16 - 18 ) .",
    "which type of emission one observes will mainly dependent upon the region s density .",
    "taken together , these various emission morphologies point to the ejecta being mostly diffuse in volume but containing small over - densities of several orders of magnitude .",
    "the exact structure of the transition region between the diffuse and clumped component is what determines the time and spatial scales over which correlated emission is observed .",
    "this ejecta structure model can also explain discrepancies in estimated expansion ages for cas  a derived from various emission band observations .",
    "the remnant s optical expansion rate is @xmath40 @xmath101% yr@xmath4 @xcite , while its x - ray expansion rate has been calculated to be @xmath102% yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission which gives rise to the lower expansion rate ( and hence higher expansion age ) is more strongly decelerated by the reverse shock ( 5000 km s@xmath4 undecelerated , to @xmath40 3750 km s@xmath4 decelerated ) , while the optical knots are hardly decelerated , remaining essentially ballistic .",
    "the x - ray emitting material that is ablated off dense ejecta clumps ( bullets ) and exhibiting a spatial offset from the optical emitting material is expected to show a range of decelerations most similar to the diffuse component but not as strongly decelerated leading to space motions not dissimilar from that of the bullets .",

    "@xcite compared _ hst _ acs observations of 1e 0102 - 7219 and found that the optical emission and x - ray emission are not exactly coincident with each other .",
    "this is consistent with the ejecta model presented here and by @xcite namely , optical emission is embedded or offset from x - ray emission due to density effects and the finite time required to shock heat the ejecta to x - ray emitting temperatures .",

    "taking into account the dynamical evolution of shocked ejecta and the relevant x - ray and optical timescales involved in the radiative and hydrodynamical evolution of shocked ejecta , we do find x - ray / optical correlations in many regions of cas a.    we have identified four cases of correlations and anti - correlations between x - ray and optical emission in the shocked ejecta in cas a. these are : 1 ) x - ray and optical emission time delays of years or even several decades where the optical emission for a region or feature shows up prior to its associated x - ray emission , 2 ) spatial offsets typically of a few arcseconds ( @xmath104 ) cm ) between a feature s optical and x - ray emission emission peaks , 3 ) regions showing significant optical emission but with no corresponding x - ray emission , and 4 ) strong x - ray emitting regions having little if any positional coincident optical emission .    to explain these correlations and anti - correlations , we propose a highly inhomogeneous density model for cas a s ejecta consisting of : 1 ) small dense knots which rapidly form optical emission following reverse shock front passage embedded in a more extended and more diffuse lower density component giving rise to associated x - ray emission but sometimes showing a significant time delay relative to the optical , 2 ) shock induced mass ablation off dense ejecta clumps thereby generating trailing low density and x - ray emitted material and hence positionally offset from the optical emitting knots , 3 ) smooth and relatively continuous high density ejecta filaments or shell walls that never reach x - ray emitting temperature , or conversely , large extended regions consisting mainly of low density ejecta , both of which lead to x - ray / optical emission anti - correlations .    a highly inhomogeneous ejecta model",
    "as proposed here for cas a may also help explain some of the x - ray / optical emission features seen in other young core collapse sn remnants .",
    "however it remains to be determined what dynamical and radiative properties of the explosion mechanism sets the relative volumes of a remnant s low and high density ejecta , how these components are distributed and arranged in the expanding debris cloud , or what are the limits to range of ejecta densities as a function of elemental abundances and expansion velocity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "further studies into some of the properties of cas  a s interior unshocked ejecta like those reported by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite may give us valuable insights to these issues .",
