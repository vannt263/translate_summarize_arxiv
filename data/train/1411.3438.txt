    "the proximity effect has been an important issue in the physics of superconductivity . in a normal metal attached to a spin - singlet @xmath1-wave superconductor , penetrating cooper pairs form the _ gap _ structure in the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level ( zero energy ) and modify low energy properties there . in spin - triplet @xmath0-wave superconductor junctions , however , the penetrating cooper pairs form a _",

    "the energy dispersion of the topological edge states is flat as a function of the wave vector in the transverse direction ( say @xmath4 ) , which represents the high degree of the degeneracy in the zero - energy states ( zess ) .",
    "the anomalous proximity effect stems from the penetration of such zess into the dirty normal metal while retaining their high degree of degeneracy  @xcite .",

    "on the basis of the above novel insight , we solve an outstanding problem regarding the anomalous proximity effect .    in this paper , we first demonstrate the anomalous proximity effect of the dresselhaus superconductors in large magnetic fields . after discussing the unitary equivalence between the hamiltonian of dresselhaus and spin - triplet @xmath2-wave superconductors , we analyze the chiral property of zess both at the edge of the superconductor and at the normal metal attached to it .",
