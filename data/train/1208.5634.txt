    "it is generally claimed that the standard model ( sm ) comprises three generations of fermions .",
    "however , many fundamental problems do not find an answer in this framework , and a possibility of additional massive fermions , such as a new sequential family of quarks , is currently among the models in the spotlight of experimental searches at the lhc ( for an overview , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . besides its phenomenological relevance",
    ", the standard model with a fourth generation can also serve as a template for new physics models for which the unitarity of the @xmath1 ckm matrix might be violated @xcite . despite the absence of hints in experimental searches",
    ", there is currently a renewed interest in the fact that new fermion families are still allowed by the electroweak precision constraints if additional parameters are considered @xcite .",
    "the strength of the attraction between heavy particles due to the higgs boson exchange increases with the particle mass .",
    "this may lead to formation of a new type of bound states @xcite .",
    "the higgs - induced bags made of heavy fermions and bosons have been considered in numerous publications - see , e.g. , [ 6 30 ] . in this paper",
    "we shall discuss some exotic decay modes of the simplest bound states - @xmath2-color singlet states , although these decay modes exist for bound states of heavy leptons as well .",
    "the decay of color - octet states was discussed in ref .",
    "since the mass difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks is expected to be less than @xmath5 mass @xcite , and the ckm matrix elements between the fourth and lower generations could be small @xcite , the main decay channels are the annihilation ones .",
    "a strong decay width for @xmath6 states is given in lowest order in @xmath7 by the well known three - gluon width : @xmath8 here @xmath7 is the strong qcd constant at the scale @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the wave function of @xmath2-bound state at the origin .      among possible decay modes of the bound states of @xmath11 or @xmath12 quarks",
    "there could be an exotic decay mode to higgs bosons .",
    "it is worth noting that decay to any number of higgs bosons is absent for a pseudoscalar state .",
    "( it is impossible to construct a pseudoscalar symmetric under permutation of bosons momenta . ) for vector states the minimal number of emitted scalar bosons could be three .",
    "two identical scalar particles can not be in a state with orbital angular momentum equal to 1 .",
    "however , for s - states total spin of @xmath2 pair is essentially decoupled from orbital motion and for the scalar higgs boson there is no difference between @xmath13 and @xmath6 states .",
    "therefore , the 3h - decay is suppressed for the s - states . for p - states , due to spin - orbit coupling , the decay in three higgs bosons is allowed .    for s - states with @xmath6",
    "there is , however , a possibility of combined decay to higgs boson + @xmath14 , or higgs boson + @xmath15 boson .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath16 or @xmath17 channels can be presented by the equation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for @xmath16 or @xmath17 , @xmath20 is the annihilation amplitude of a free quark - antiquark pair with the relative momentum @xmath21 and the momentum @xmath22 of @xmath14-quantum or @xmath15 boson .",

    "the amplitude @xmath27 is equal to @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the fermi constant , @xmath30 is the quark mass , and @xmath31 is the quark electric charge . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the 4-momenta of the quark and anti - quark , @xmath34 is the 4-momentum of the emitted @xmath14-quantum , and @xmath35 is the polarization vector of the @xmath14-quantum with the polarization @xmath36 . at @xmath37",
    "the amplitude simplifies considerably .",
    "dirac 4-spinors become effectively two component ones , @xmath38 , and the amplitude becomes @xmath39 where we introduced the polarization vector of @xmath2 bound state @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the mass of @xmath2 state , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the spin projections of the quark and the anti - quark .    with this amplitude for the @xmath16-decay width",
    "we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a fine structure constant , and @xmath46 is the higgs mass .    both widths , eq.([1 ] ) and eq([2 ] ) , are proportional to @xmath47 ,",
    "therefore their ratio does not depend on details of the wave function and can be used to estimate the importance of the @xmath16-decay mode . in fig.(1 ) we plot the ratio @xmath48 for @xmath49 quarkonium as a function of fermion mass for the higgs mass @xmath50 gev within an interval of the fermion mass @xmath51 gev . obviously , the @xmath16-decay mode dominates in the whole mass interval .     decay width",

    "the ratio in fig.(1 ) was calculated for @xmath3 quarkonium . for @xmath4",

    "the binding energy of the system can be written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 represents relativistic and radiative corrections , respectively .",
    "the exact expressions of all the operators in ( [ octetenergy ] ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "we will present the results for their values averaged over the wave function ( [ 3 ] ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 for 4 g quark - the number of heavy fermions in the polarization loop and coefficient @xmath14 is given by the following expression : @xmath61 minimizing the binding energy eq.([octetenergy ] ) with respect to parameter @xmath53 in the trial function eq.([3 ] ) we obtain both the variational binding energy and the variational wave function used in eqs.([1],[2 ] ) .",

    "the corresponding factor is 3.25 times larger and the hz - width becomes comparable with h@xmath14-width .",
    "the ratio of the total width to the @xmath72 binding energy for the vector state is shown in fig.(4 ) . in the whole mass interval",
    "the ratio is smaller than 1% , therefore , in case of small mixing with lower generations , the vector bound states are long lived .     as a function of the fermion mass for @xmath6 state . ]",
    "for pseudoscalar states the main decay mode is the two - gluon one . the decay into two gammas or two w - bosons is much smaller . the width for decay in two",
    "w - boson is @xmath73 at all fermion masses in the discussed range @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the total annihilation width is small compared to the binding energy and @xmath75 states are also long lived in case of small mixing .",
    "we discussed new decay modes for bound states of heavy @xmath0-pair . in the absence of strong mixing with lower generations , annihilation to higgs-@xmath14 and",
    "higgs - z dominates the annihilation into hadrons for @xmath76 states .",
    "detection of a single high energy @xmath14-quantum can be a clear signal of creation the heavy bound @xmath0 pair . for @xmath75 state , decays to higgs boson in final states are suppressed .",
    "the allowed decay is to w - pair .",
    "however , its width is small compared to annihilation into hadrons . in both cases the total annihilation width is small compared to binding energy , therefore the bound states are long lived .",
    "it is worth to say that the discussed decay modes exist for any fermion - antifermion bound states including heavy leptons and heavy neutrinos if their masses are high enough to form a bound state due to attractive higgs boson exchange potential .",
