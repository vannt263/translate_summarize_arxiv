    "the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) interpretational paradigms have been expressed in three letters @xcite and can be here summarized as follows : + * 1 ) the relative space - time transformation ( rstt ) paradigm @xcite : * the first paradigm emphasizes the relevance of having the correct space - time parametrization of the source , which necessarily implies the knowledge of the equations of motion of the system and its entire worldline . + * 2 ) the interpretation of the burst structure ( ibs ) paradigm @xcite : * the second paradigm emphasizes the structure of the most general grb as composed of a proper grb ( p - grb ) and an extended afterglow , and emphasizes as well the common origin of the short and long grbs as originating both from a gravitational collapse to a black hole . + * 3 ) the grb - supernova time sequence ( gsts ) paradigm @xcite : * the third paradigm emphasizes on the concept of induced gravitational collapse , which was initially considered an effect of grb triggering the late phase evolution of the progenitor star leading to the supernova ( sn ) .",
    "we shall present an evolution of this paradigm .    in the next sections we summarize the structure of our model",
    ", we outline some progress made in recent years and we emphasize the relevance of the grbs connected with sne for testing these paradigms .",
    "in particular , in section [ 991216 ] we speak about grb 991216 as the first test ground of our model and in section [ 050315 ] we discuss grb 050315 which has given a confirmation of our predictions .",
    "we are then entitled to apply our theoretical framework to the analysis of the prompt emission of grbs associated with sne .",
    "we proceed first to grb 980425 in section [ 980425 ] ; we go then to grb 030329 in section [ 030329 ] ; finally , in section [ 031203 ] we discuss grb 031203 where we show a theoretical prediction of an hard - to - soft spectral evolution .",
    "we summarize the general results of these grbs associated with sne in tab .",
    "[ tabella ] and we make some general conclusions about the general structure of grb , sn and urca sources as well as some recent additions to our gsts paradigm about the induced gravitational collapse .",
    "our grb model , like all prevailing models in the existing literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , is based on the acceleration of an optically thick electron - positron plasma .",
    "the specific issue of the origin and energetics of such a plasma , either in relation to black hole physics or to other physical processes , has often been discussed qualitatively in the grb scientific literature but never quantitatively with explicit equations .",
    "the concept of the dyadosphere @xcite is the only attempt , as far as we know , to do this .",
    "this relates such an electron - positron plasma to black hole physics and to the characteristics of the grb progenitor star , using explicit equations that satisfy the existing physical laws .",
    "far from being just a theoretical discussion , this is essential to show that the physical origin and energetics of grbs are the blackholic energy of the kerr - newman metric as defined by the @xcite mass - energy formula ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein , see also @xcite ) .",
    "models of grbs based on a single source ( the `` collapsar '' ) generating both the sn and the grb abounds in the literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our approach",
    "we have emphasized the concept of induced gravitational collapse , which occurs strictly in a binary system .",
    "the sn originates from a star evolved out of the main sequence and the grb from the collapse to a black hole .",
    "the two phenomena are qualitatively very different .",
    "there is still much to be discovered about sne due to their complexity , while the grb is much better known since its collapse to a black hole is now understood .",
    "the concept of induced collapse implies at least two alternative scenarios . in the first",

    "induce gravitational collapse of a companion neutron star to a black hole @xcite .",
    "of course , in absence of sn , there is also the possibility that the collapse to a black hole , generating the grb , occurs in a single star system or in the final collapse of a binary neutron star system .",

    "turning now to the grb origin , a major difference between our theoretical model and the ones in the current literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the first afterglow regime corresponds to a bolometric luminosity monotonically increasing with the photon detector arrival time , corresponding to a substantially constant lorentz gamma factor of the accelerated baryons .",
    "the second regime consists of the bolometric luminosity peak , corresponding to the `` knee '' in the decreasing phase of the baryonic lorentz gamma factor .",
    "the third regime corresponds to a bolometric luminosity decreasing with arrival time , corresponding to the late deceleration of the lorentz gamma factor . in some sources",
    "the p - grb is under the observability threshold . in @xcite",
    "we have chosen as a prototype the source grb 991216 which clearly shows the existence of the p - grb and the three regimes of the afterglow ( see fig .",
    "[ 991216_fig ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , data from batse existed only up to @xmath6 s , and data from r - xte and chandra only after @xmath7 s , leaving our theoretical predictions in the whole range between @xmath6 s and @xmath7 s without the support of the comparison with observational data .",
    "nevertheless , both the relative intensity of the p - grb to the peak of the afterglow in such source , as well as their corresponding temporal lag , were theoretically predicted within a few percent ( see fig .",
    "11 in @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to the data provided by the _ swift _ satellite , we were finally able to confirm , by direct confrontation with the observational data , our theoretical predictions on the grb structure with a detailed fit of the complete afterglow light curve of grb 050315 , from the peak , including the `` prompt emission '' , all the way to the latest phases without any gap in the observational data ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the best fit of the grb 050315 observational data leads to a total energy of the black hole dyadosphere , generating the @xmath5 plasma , @xmath8 erg ( the observational _ swift _ @xmath9 is @xmath10 erg , see * ? ? ?",

    "it has been recently pointed out @xcite that almost all the grbs observed by _ swift _ show a `` canonical behavior '' : an initial very steep decay followed by a shallow decay and finally a steeper decay . in order to explain these features many different approaches",
    "have been proposed @xcite . in our treatment",
    "these behaviors are automatically described by the same mechanism responsible for the prompt emission , which is our case coincides with the peak of the afterglow .",
    "the baryonic shell expands in an interstellar medium ( ism ) region from a radius @xmath19 cm up to @xmath20 cm with average effective ism density @xmath21 particle/@xmath22 .",
    "the remaining part of the afterglow appears to have a significantly lower effective ism density , decreasing inversely proportional with the distance .",
    "we find the effective ism density @xmath23 particle/@xmath22 at @xmath24 cm and @xmath25 particle/@xmath22 at @xmath26 cm .",
    "this produces a slower decrease of the velocity of the baryons with a consequent longer duration of the afterglow emission .",
    "the initial steep decay of the observed flux is due to the smaller number of collisions with the ism . in fig . [ 050315_global ] is represented our theoretical fit of the xrt data , together with the theoretically computed @xmath3@xmath4 kev light curve ( details in * ? ? ?",
    "we attribute this decrease in the ism effective density to a sudden fragmentation of the baryonic shell . what is impressive is that no different scenarios need to be advocated in order to explain the features of the light curves : both the prompt and the afterglow emission are just due to the inelastic collisions of the expanding baryonic shell with the ism , which produce a radiation with a thermal spectrum in the co - moving frame @xcite .",

    "are shown samples of time - resolved spectra for eight different values of the arrival time which cover the whole duration of the event .",
    "it is manifest from this picture that , although the spectrum in the co - moving frame of the expanding pulse is thermal , the shape of the final spectrum in the laboratory frame is clearly non thermal .",
    "in fact , as explained in @xcite , each single instantaneous spectrum is the result of an integration of millions of thermal spectra , each one duly weighted by appropriate lorentz and doppler factors , over the corresponding equitemporal surface ( eqts , see * ? ? ?",

    "this calculation produces a non thermal instantaneous spectrum in the observer frame ( see fig .",
