    "one of major unresolved problems of astrophysics of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is the form of their soft -ray spectra ( at energies @xmath0 kev ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies are known relatively well , and consist ( at @xmath1 kev ) of power - law , compton reflection , and fe k@xmath2 components ( e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ; nandra et al .",
    "1997 ; zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 ) . however , the form of a high - energy cutoff of the power law remains poorly constrained . in the case of the brightest radio - quiet seyfert , ngc 4151 , results from the oriented scintillation spectroscopy experiment ( osse ; johnson et al .",
    "1993 ) aboard _ compton gamma ray observatory _ show the spectrum above 50 kev is well described by thermal comptonization ( e.g. , zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz 1996 ; johnson et al .  1997a , hereafter j97 ) .",
    "however , the x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 is heavily absorbed and it is not clear whether its intrinsic spectrum is typical for seyferts .    in the case of other radio - quiet seyferts ,",
    "constraints ( from either osse , _ rxte _ or _ bepposax _ ) on the form of their individual soft -ray spectra are rather poor due to limited photon statistics .",
    "one way to better constrain the soft -ray properties is to consider average spectra .",
    "studies of the average @xmath3500 kev spectra of seyferts observed by both and osse ( zdziarski et al .  1995 ; gondek et al .  1996 ,",
    "hereafter g96 ) and and osse ( g96 ) have shown that purely non - thermal models ( e.g. , lightman & zdziarski 1987 ) are highly unlikely .",
    "although those authors have shown that thermal comptonization provides a good description of the observed spectra , they have approximated model spectra from that process by a power law with an exponential cutoff .",
    "this simple model has also been used in numerous studies of individual objects ( e.g. , zdziarski et al .",
    "1994 ; bassani et al .  1995 ; weaver , krolik & pier 1998 ; matt 1999 ; perola et al .",
    "1999 ) , with the obtained e - folding energies being in fair agreement with those obtained for the average spectra .",
    "the e - folded power law , however , provides only a rough approximation to the actual spectral shape from thermal comptonization , and the relationship between the e - folding energy and the electron temperature is not straightforward ( e.g. , stern et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is to determine the tightest currently possible constraints on the range of electron temperature , @xmath4 , and the thomson optical depth , @xmath5 , in radio - quiet seyferts . to achieve this ,",
    "we compute here the average osse spectra of _ all _ radio - quiet seyfert 1s and of seyfert 2s observed ( except ngc 4151 , the brightest object by far ) . we stress that osse still remains the most sensitive detector in the range @xmath0 kev currently operating and",
    "it will be surpassed only by the ibis detector aboard _ integral _ ( ubertini et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we fit the obtained data sets ( with the useful energy range of @xmath6500 kev ) with a highly - accurate model of thermal comptonization of poutanen & svensson ( 1996 ) .",
    "we find that their statistical accuracy is sufficient to provide useful constraints on the average parameters of the comptonizing plasma in those sources .",
    "furthermore , we apply this model to the previously obtained average osse spectrum of ngc 4151 ( j97 ) and to the average @xmath3500 kev spectra of seyfert 1s from and osse and and osse of g96 .",
    "table 1 gives the log of observations of all ( except ngc 4151 ) radio - quiet seyfert 1s and 2s detected by osse through the end of 1998 .",
    "the data for individual objects include systematic errors estimated from the uncertainties in the low - energy calibration and response of the detectors using both in - orbit and pre - launch calibration data , and correspond to an uncertainty in the effective area in the osse response .",
    "this uncertainty is @xmath7 at 50 kev decreasing to @xmath8 at @xmath9 kev .",
    "table 1 also gives the photon power - law indices , @xmath10 , fitted in the 50200 kev range to sums of observations of individual seyferts with detection significance @xmath11 .",
    "the indices are plotted in figure [ indices ] .",
    "the mean and its error of the best - fit values for seyfert 1s and 2s are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the intrinsic dispersions of the distributions ( given by their standard deviations ) are 0.37 and 0.42 , respectively . the probability that the 2 distributions have the same mean and standard deviation is 5% , as obtained from the student @xmath14 distribution .",
    "the mean weighted by the uncertainties and its error for seyfert 1s and 2s are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we have then coadded the spectra of seyfert 1s and 2s , obtaining data sets with @xmath17 s and @xmath18 s of osse exposure ( scaled to a single osse detector with an effective area of 500 @xmath19 ) with @xmath20 and @xmath21 of source photons ( in the 50150 kev range ) from 17 and 10 agns , respectively .",
    "source photons in the average seyfert 1 and 2 spectra are then detected in the ranges of @xmath6500 kev and 50400 kev , respectively .",
    "the upper limits at higher energies are much above our model spectra and thus we use only the above energy ranges in our fits .",
    "first , we note that the average osse data when fitted by a power law ( pl ) give spectral indices , @xmath10 , significantly higher ( table 2 ) than the average x - ray spectral index of seyfert 1s , @xmath222.0 ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "this implies the presence of a spectral break between @xmath23 and @xmath6 kev .",
    "then , we test for the presence of high - energy cutoffs in the average spectra themselves .",
    "we find statistically significant fit improvements when the power - law model is replaced by an e - folded power law ( epl ) in both seyfert 1s and 2s , see table 2 .",
    "the probability that the fit improvement were by chance ( obtained using the f - test ) equals to 0.003 in each case .",
    "this result argues strongly that spectra of individual seyferts have high - energy cutoffs in a relatively narrow range of energies .",
    "if , instead , there were a wide power - law distribution of the cutoff energies , the sum spectrum would be a power law without a cutoff .",
    "we then consider a model with thermal comptonization ( tc ) and compton reflection .",
    "we use the model compps v3.4 ( poutanen & svensson 1996 ) in xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "since the actual geometry of seyferts remains mostly unknown , we choose here spherical geometry , which is relatively generic , with spectra independent of the viewing angle . in similar spirit",
    ", we assume the source of seed photons at the center with a blackbody spectrum at @xmath24 ev .",
    "this model has been extensively tested against a monte carlo method ( gierliski 2000 ) , and figure [ compare ] shows a good agreement between spectra obtained with the two methods ( for the plasma parameters close to those of the -osse fit below ) . as the independent parameters of the model , we choose the electron temperature , @xmath4 , and the compton @xmath25 parameter , @xmath26 where @xmath5 is the radial thomson optical depth .",
    "a given value of @xmath25 corresponds to an approximately constant value of the 210 kev spectral index , @xmath27 ( e.g. , ghisellini & haardt 1994 ; poutanen 1998 ; beloborodov 1999b ; see below ) .",
    "reflection is treated using angle - dependent green s functions of magdziarz & zdziarski ( 1995 ) and neglecting comptonization of the reflected radiation in the hot plasma .",
    "then , the obtained strength of reflection , @xmath28 ( defined relative to the reflection strength from an isotropic point source above a slab ) , corresponds approximately to its unscattered fraction . since the osse data can not independently constrain @xmath25 , @xmath4 and @xmath28 , we keep @xmath28 fixed at 0.75 , obtained by fitting the average seyfert-1 spectrum from and osse of g96 .",
    "the inclination assumed by g96 is @xmath29 ( e.g.  nandra et al.1997 ) , which we also assume in our fit to the seyfert-1 spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "seyfert 2s are most likely seen more edge - on , and we assume @xmath30 for the seyfert-2 spectrum .",
    "we assume the reflecting medium is close to neutral with the abundances of anders & ebihara ( 1982 ) .    the resulting data and model spectra are shown in figure [ spectra ] .",
    "the parameters are given in table 2 and the error contours are shown in figure [ contours ] .",
    "its right vertical axis shows the value of the index @xmath27 ( of the comptonization spectrum without the reflection component ) computed at @xmath31 kev . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath27 is a weak function of @xmath4 at a given @xmath25 , and it changes within @xmath32 for 50 kev @xmath33 kev .",
    "we see that the error contour for seyfert 1s is consistent within @xmath34 with their average x - ray spectral index being approximately @xmath35 ( nandra & pounds 1994 ; zdziarski et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the range of @xmath4 corresponding to this @xmath27 is @xmath36150 kev .",
    "we have also refitted the average x - ray/-ray ( x@xmath37 ) spectra of seyfert 1s observed by both _",
    "ginga _ and osse and by and osse of g96 .",
    "we fitted them ( in the range @xmath38 kev ) in the same way as in g96 except for modeling the primary continuum by thermal comptonization instead of the e- folded power law .",
    "we obtain @xmath39 kev , 166 kev , and @xmath40 , 0.59 , respectively , at the best fits , with the error contours shown in figure [ contours ] .",
    "the resulting parameters are consistent within @xmath34 with those of the average spectrum of all seyfert 1s observed by osse .",
    "however , our current data set , with photon statistics being much better than those of the two osse spectra of g96 , represents the currently best estimate of the average @xmath4 in seyfert 1s",
    ".    figures [ spectra ] and [ contours ] also show the spectrum and the error contour , respectively , for the average of osse observations of the brightest seyfert , ngc 4151 ( j97 ) obtained with the same model .",
    "since the strength of reflection in ngc 4151 is rather uncertain due to strong absorption in x - rays , we have constrained @xmath28 to be in the 01 range while computing the error contour ( which assumption is responsible for its irregular shape ) .",
    "we see that the x - ray spectrum implied by these data is very similar to that of typical seyfert 1s , with @xmath412.0 .",
    "the obtained range of temperature is relatively low , @xmath4280 kev , in agreement with the results of zdziarski et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and j97 .",
    "the weighted average of the 50200 kev indices of individual objects ( table 1 and figure [ indices ] ) and the indices in the power - law fits to the sum spectra ( table 2 ) for seyfert 1s , @xmath15 and @xmath43 , respectively , are significantly softer than those for seyfert 2s , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the probability that the 2 samples are drawn from the same distribution is only 5% (  [ s : data ] ) .",
    "this difference is confirmed by figures [ spectra ] , [ contours ] , where we see that the average spectrum of seyfert 2s is noticeably harder than that of seyfert 1s .",
    "we have investigated whether this difference can be explained by the viewing angle different between seyfert 1s and 2s .",
    "one relevant effect is the strength of compton reflection decreasing with the increasing viewing angle . since the spectrum from compton reflection typically peaks around 30 kev followed by a steep decline at higher energies , the larger @xmath28 the softer the spectrum in the osse range .",
    "however , this effect is already included in our comptonization / reflection model , and figure [ contours ] shows that it is not sufficient to account for the difference between the @xmath25 parameters of the average spectra .",
    "we note , however , that the average inclination of seyfert 2s remains unknown .",
    "we have found we can fit the two spectra with the same comptonization / reflection model ( with @xmath46 ) if @xmath47 for seyfert 2s within 90% confidence .",
    "an additional subtle effect appears when the comptonizing medium has a slab geometry .",
    "namely , photons emitted at a large viewing angle ( with respect to the slab normal ) undergo a larger number of scatterings than those emitted at a small viewing angle , due to the escape probability at a given depth from the surface , @xmath48 , in a given direction being @xmath49 .",
    "we have thus fitted our data with a model in which the comptonizing medium forms a slab with a half - thickness @xmath5 and the seed photons are emitted by point sources in the midplane .",
    "we have first fitted with this model the -osse spectrum of g96 , and then fixed the obtained @xmath28 in the fits to our average spectra .",
    "the resulting best - fit parameters are @xmath50 kev , 67 kev , @xmath51 , 0.48 , for seyfert 1s and 2s , respectively .",
    "the error contours are shown in figure [ slab ] .",
    "we see that the two parameter ranges are still incompatible with each other .",
    "this means that the spectral shape does not change sufficiently due to this effect to account for the observed spectral difference ( see figure [ spectra ] ) .",
    "for example , in the case of the best - fit seyfert-1 model spectrum ( including both comptonization and reflection ) , the ratio of monochromatic fluxes at 150 kev and 50 kev increases only by 14% when the inclination changes from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "the above results also show that the obtained values of @xmath4 and @xmath52 only weakly depend on geometry . for seyfert 2s",
    ", our results imply @xmath27 between 1.4 and 1.9 and @xmath4 between 50 and 170 kev .",
    "we then consider possible effects of absorption / scattering in a torus surrounding the central source being important in seyfert 2s .",
    "this can be an important effect in the osse range only when the torus is thomson - thick , @xmath53 @xmath54 . then the hardening occurs ( apart from a weak effect of photo - electric absorption ) because the torus becomes more transparent to scattering with the increasing photon energy due to the klein - nishina effects .",
    "we have applied a numerical model of torus absorption / scattering of krolik , madau , & ycki ( 1994 ) to our average spectrum of seyfert 2s assuming the intrinsic spectrum from thermal comptonization of seyfert 1s .",
    "we have obtained a good fit ( @xmath55 ) at @xmath56 @xmath54 with an intrinsic tc spectrum identical in the cases of seyfert 1s and 2s with a torus with an opening angle of @xmath57 . however , since that numerical model does not allow for including compton reflection from a disk , we can not obtain meaningful constraints on its parameter space .    on the other hand , the only seyfert 2 in our sample with a thomson - thick absorber is ngc 4945 ( risaliti , maiolino & salvati 1999 ) , with @xmath58 @xmath54 ( see also madejski et al .",
    "2000 ) , which nucleus is also viewed edge - on ( greenhill , moran & herrnstein 1997 ) . also , some effect of absorption on the osse band is possible in mkn 3 , with @xmath59 @xmath54 ( cappi et al .",
    "then , @xmath60@xmath61 @xmath54 in ngc 4507 and ngc 4388 , and @xmath62 @xmath63 in other seyfert 2s in our sample ( risaliti et al.1999 ) , in which cases the effect of scattering on our spectra is negligible .",
    "thus , we can not rule out an intrinsic difference between seyfert 1s and 2s .",
    "such a difference may be hinted for by x - ray spectra of individual seyfert 2s often appearing harder than those of seyfert 1s ( e.g. , bassani et al .",
    "1995 ; smith & done 1996 ) .",
    "if indeed the x - ray spectra of seyfert 2s were harder than those of seyfert 1s , then our results above would indicate a correlation between the x - ray slope and that in the osse band .",
    "on the other hand , we consider it possible that a complex structure of the absorber causes underestimating of the actual @xmath27 and @xmath64 in some seyfert 2s .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that our obtained difference between the soft -ray spectra of seyfert 1s and 2s is simply caused by large relative contributions of a few bright objects to our average spectra . in the case of seyfert 1s , 38% of the total number of source photons come from ic 4329a . for seyfert 2s",
    ", we have 29% and 24% contributions from ngc 4388 and ngc 4945 , respectively .",
    "thus , if those objects had atypical spectra for their categories , they would significantly bias the shape of the average spectra . however , inspection of the distribution of the spectral indices in figure [ indices ] does not confirm this supposition .",
    "all 3 objects have spectra quite typical for their corresponding category .",
    "on the other hand , it is interesting that 4 narrow - emission line galaxies ( nelgs ) in our sample of seyfert 2s ( fig .",
    "[ indices ] ) have somewhat softer spectra than regular seyfert 2s ( which effect is most pronounced for ngc 5506 ) .",
    "nelgs are objects intermediate between seyfert 1s and 2s , and are often considered together with seyfert 1s in one class ( e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "figure [ indices ] also marks 2 seyferts classified as type 1.5 included in our seyfert-1 sample .    in order to further investigate the issue of the effect of individual objects on our average spectra ,",
    "we have also studied average seyfert 1 and 2 spectra derived from observations up to the end of 1995 .",
    "those averages were based on @xmath65 of the statistics of the present spectra ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 photons , respectively ) .",
    "those samples contain , e.g. , less than half of the photons from ic 4329a , none of ngc 3516 , and almost none from ngc 4945 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "thus , if ic 4329a and ngc 4945 were substantially different from the average seyfert 1 and 2 , respectively , we would expect significant differences in the spectral shape of the old and new averages .",
    "however , the old and new average spectra can be fitted with identical models with hardly any increase of @xmath68 with respect to independent fits , and the f - test gives the probability that their spectral shape differ of @xmath69 for either seyfert 1s or 2s .    summarizing , we do find that seyfert 2s have significantly harder spectra than seyfert 1s ( whereas their cutoff energies or temperatures are similar ) .",
    "this difference can be explained by the dependence of compton reflection on orientation only for orientation close to edge - on ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the angular dependence of thermal - comptonization spectra in slab geometry is of relatively minor importance . the effect of thomson - thick absorption in a torus surrounding the x@xmath37 source is important in ngc 4945 and , possibly , mkn 3 .",
    "we have obtained quantitative constraints on the average electron temperature and the compton parameter ( or , equivalently , the thomson optical depth ) in seyfert 1s and 2s ( approximately @xmath42150 kev and @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) .",
    "these results put constraints on theoretical models of seyferts as well as of the cosmic x@xmath37 background .",
    "a detailed analysis of these constraints is beyond the scope of this work and we only outline the main relevant issues below .",
    "physically , the value of temperature in a source is determined by energy balance between heating and cooling .",
    "the balance depends , first of all , on the source geometry , which determines the flux of seed photons incident on the plasma .",
    "production of seed photons appears to be dominated by blackbody photons emitted by an optically - thick medium in the vicinity of the hot plasma ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ) , with the flux of thermal synchrotron photons being negligible in luminous agns ( wardziski & zdziarski 2000 ) .",
    "thus , the values of @xmath4 puts constraints on the geometry of the x - ray sources .",
    "two geometries appear possible : a patchy corona above a cold accretion disk , and a hot accretion disk with an overlapping cold medium ( either an outer cold disk , cold blobs or both , see , e.g. , poutanen 1998 , zdziarski et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the patchy corona geometry has been discussed recently by , e.g. , haardt , maraschi & ghisellini ( 1994 ) , stern et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , poutanen & svensson ( 1996 ) , g96 , and beloborodov ( 1999a ) . in the case of seyferts which have on average quite soft spectra ( @xmath73 ) and large reflection ( @xmath74 )",
    ", the patchy static corona still appears to be a viable model .",
    "the situation is different for those objects which have hard spectra and little reflection ( see zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ) . in order to produce hard spectra",
    ", the emitting region should be well separated from the cold accretion disk ( e.g. , svensson 1996 ) , but in that case the predicted reflection is close to unity .",
    "mildly relativistic motions of emitting plasma away from the disk , however , solve both problems producing hard spectra and little reflection ( beloborodov 1999a , b ) .",
    "we also note that this model can produce reflection larger than unity when emitting plasma is moving towards the disk .",
    "coronal models either with or without  pair production are possible .",
    "we note that studies of thermal pair plasmas in pair equilibrium predict no distinct pair annihilation even from a pair - dominated plasmas ( macioek - niedwiecki , zdziarski & coppi 1995 ) .",
    "thus , the lack of such a feature observed by osse ( e.g. , j97 ) does not rule out the presence of thermal  pairs .    the hot disk model has been developed by shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 ) , whose solution branch was cooling - dominated ( and thermally unstable ) .",
    "including advection gives rise to a stable , low - luminosity solution branch , and the intersection of the two branches limits the luminosity and the optical depth of an inner flow ( narayan & yi 1995 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; see zdziarski 1998 for a model parametrizing the flow by @xmath25 ) .",
    "the role of  pair production is in general negligible ( bjrnsson et al .",
    "the values of @xmath75 kev and @xmath72 are predicted by this model close to the maximum possible luminosity of the hot flow , in an agreement with our results . in order to account for the observed range of @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
    "an overlap between the hot disk and a cold one is required ( poutanen , krolik & ryde 1997 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that black - hole binaries in their hard states show x@xmath37 spectra very similar to those of radio - quiet seyferts .",
    "for example , spectra of cyg x-1 and gx 3394 have been well modeled by thermal comptonization at @xmath76 , and @xmath75 kev and @xmath36 kev , respectively ( gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ; zdziarski et al .  1998 ) .",
    "hard - state x@xmath37 spectra of x - ray novae are also similar ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "another class of objects for which a comparison with seyferts is of interest is broad - line radio galaxies .",
    "their x@xmath37 spectra have been studied by woniak et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who found both their x - ray and soft -ray spectra ( with @xmath77 , and @xmath78 in the 50500 kev band ) to be harder than those of seyfert 1s ( similarly to the case of seyfert 2s ) . on the other hand , woniak et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have not found a high - energy cutoff in their average osse spectrum , indicating the importance of non - thermal compton scattering .",
    "this conclusion has to be considered tentative as the statistical accuracy of that spectrum is much below those of radio - quiet seyferts .",
    "still , a support for the importance of non - thermal processes in radio galaxies is provided by the -ray spectrum of the radio galaxy cen a , which has a broken power - law form with the spectral breaks at @xmath79 kev and @xmath80 mev ( steinle et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the form of the average spectra of seyfert 1s and 2s is of primary importance synthesizing the cosmic x@xmath37 background from individual sources .",
    "this synthesis appears possible provided seyfert 2s dominate the hard x - ray background ( e.g. , zdziarski et al .  1995 ;",
    "comastri et al .",
    "we have obtained error contours in the @xmath4-@xmath25 space for the average spectra of seyfert 1s and 2s observed by osse . combining the contours for seyfert 1s with their average x - ray spectral index of @xmath222 ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) , we obtain @xmath81150 kev .",
    "the corresponding thomson optical depth ( @xmath82 ) of seyfert 1s is @xmath831.5 in spherical geometry and @xmath840.6 in slab geometry .",
    "we also find both the average and individual seyfert-2 spectra are significantly harder than those of seyfert 1s",
    ". this difference can be partly due to the spectral component from compton reflection being weak in seyfert 2s , provided their average inclination is edge - on enough .",
    "furthermore , thomson - thick absorption can account for the difference in 2 ( out of 8) objects in our sample .",
