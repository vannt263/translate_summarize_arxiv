    "chronic diseases are health conditions that can neither be prevented nor be cured but can only be managed .",
    "they have been the major consumer of health - care funds throughout the world . in america alone",
    "there are more than 133 million people  which is more than 40% of the u.s .",
    "population  who suffer from one or more chronic diseases @xcite . in the u.s .",
    "they account for 81% of hospital admissions , 91% of prescriptions filled and 76% of all physician visits @xcite . though the list of chronic conditions is long , the top five conditions are : heart disease , cancers , stroke , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) and diabetes . in 2010 , 68% of the healthcare spending  more than trillion dollars",
    " went towards the treatment of chronic diseases @xcite .",
    "the successful management of chronic diseases has two components : ( i ) self - management by the patients , and ( ii ) management by physicians while adhering to strict guidelines .",
    "the failure of either component will lead to the failure of the whole enterprise for the management of chronic diseases .",
    "we selected chronic heart failure ( chf ) as our first chronic disease to build tools to manage .",
    "chronic heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump properly ; consequently , not enough oxygen - rich blood can be supplied to all parts of the body .",
    "this causes congestion of blood in the lungs , abdomen , legs , etc .",
    ", causing uneasiness while carrying out any kind of physical activity .",
    "half of the people diagnosed with chf die within five years . in u.s .",
    "alone there are 5.7 million people currently living with chf @xcite .",
    "this disease affects all age groups including children .",
    "the cost of this disease to the economy is enormous .",
    "the statistics show that there are 11 million physician visits and 875,000 hospitalizations per year due to chf .",
    "25% of patient with chf are readmitted to a hospital or visit an emergency room within thirty days of treatment .",
    "this causes hospitals to lose money , as new regulations require them to bear the cost of readmission if it occurs within a period of thirty days .",
    "our work on chronic disease management started several years ago with the building of a telemedicine - based chronic disease management system designed to facilitate the self - management of chronic diseases by patients @xcite .",
    "our chronic care platform was put to test to see whether it can successfully prevent patients from going to an emergency room or being readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of discharge after the original chf episode .",
    "this was done in collaboration with texas health resources ( thr ) , one of the largest hospital chains in the southwestern united states .",
    "statistically , 25% of discharged patients would be readmitted within 30 days . in our clinical study ,",
    "12 patients discharged from texas methodist hospital in cleburne , texas after chf episodes were chosen as subjects .",
    "( note that though the number of patients used in the trial is not statistically significant to make any generalization but does prove the viability of our system ) .",
    "these patients were provided with our chronic care platform and peripheral devices such as a weighing scale , blood pressure meter , gluco - meter and pulse oximeter ( these devices measure the vitals directly and are connected to our telemedicine device via bluetooth ) . after some training by case nurses , the patients measured their vital signs periodically using these bluetooth - enabled devices and answered questionnaires about their health . using our platform , their vital sign data was automatically uploaded to a server where it was available for processing and viewing . working remotely",
    ", the case nurse was able to manage the patients and prevent all of them from begin readmitted within 30 days @xcite .",
    "the telemedicine platform that we initially developed , and that we have licensed to a commercial company , only facilitated the transfer of information from patients residing remotely to the doctors and nurses providing care .    in this paper , we focus on the second component of chf management , namely , a physician advisory system .",
    "this system assists physicians in adhering to the guidelines for managing chf .",
    "the chf management guidelines are published by the american college of cardiology foundation ( accf ) and the american heart association ( aha ) .",
    "the most recent version is the 2013 accf / aha guideline for the management of heart failure @xcite .",
    "these guidelines were created by a committee of physicians based on thorough review of clinical evidence on heart failure management .",
    "they represent a consensus among the physicians on the appropriate treatment and management of heart failure @xcite .",
    "though evidence - based guidelines should be the basis for all disease management @xcite , physicians adherence to guidelines is very poor @xcite .",
    "the major reasons for the failure of guideline implementation are lack of awareness , lack of familiarity , lack of motivation and external barriers . for 78% of clinical practice guidelines , more than 10% of the physicians are not aware of their existence . even when the guidelines are readily accessible , the physicians are not familiar enough with the guidelines to apply them correctly . in all the physician surveys conducted ,",
    "the lack of familiarity was more common than the lack of awareness @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for the lack of familiarity is that the guidelines can be quite complex , as in the case of chf management .",
    "for example , more than 100 variables have been associated with mortality and re - hospitalization related to heart failure . in the 2013 accf",
    "/ aha guideline for the management of heart failure , the variables range from simple information like age and sex to sophisticated data like the patterns in electrocardiogram and history of chf - related symptoms and diseases .",
    "the rules for treatment recommendation in the guideline look like the following :    with more than 60 rules like the ones above , giving correct recommendations becomes an error - prone task for even the most experienced physicians @xcite .    to overcome the difficulties that physicians face in implementing the guidelines , we have developed a physician advisory system that automates the 2013 accf / aha guideline for the management of heart failure .",
    "our physician advisory system is able to give recommendations like a real human physician who is following the guidelines strictly , even under the condition of incomplete information about the patient .",
    "our physician - advisory system for chronic heart failure management relies on answer set programming @xcite for coding the guidelines .",
    "the guideline rules are fairly complex and require the use of negation as failure , non - monotonic reasoning and reasoning with incomplete information . a fairly common situation in medicine",
    "is that a drug can only be recommended if its use is not contraindicated ( i.e. , the use of the drug will not have an adverse impact on that patient ) .",
    "contraindication is naturally modeled via negation as failure .",
    "the ability of answer set programming to model defaults , exceptions , weak exceptions , preferences , etc . , makes it ideally suited for coding these guidelines .",
    "traditional techniques such as logic programming ( prolog ) and production systems ( ops5 ) , or traditional expert system styled approaches will result in a far more complex system due to the inability of these systems to model negation as failure effectively @xcite . for example , in prolog , negation as failure is unsound for non - grounded goals , and if care is not taken , then use of negation as failure in prolog programs can often lead to non - termination .",
    "thus , coding our system in these formalisms would be a much more difficult and complex task .",
    "in contrast , the chf guidelines can be coded in asp very naturally ( it took about 2 months to develop the first version of the system ) .    with the help of a telemedicine platform @xcite and electronic medical records ( emr ) integrated with our asp - based system , significant automation can be achieved . besides boosting the physicians compliance with the guidelines , the system can enable patients with chf to manage their conditions with minimal supervision by doctors .",
    "the rest of this paper presents our asp - based physician - advisory system as well as the knowledge patterns we have developed .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with asp @xcite .",
    "the 2013 accf / aha guideline for the management of heart failure is intended to assist healthcare providers in clinical decision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches for the management of chronic heart failure .",
    "the guideline is based on four progressive stages of heart failure .",
    "stage a includes patients at risk of heart failure who are asymptomatic and do not have structural heart disease .",
    "stage b describes asymptomatic patients with structural heart diseases ; it includes new york heart association ( nyha ) class i , in which ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms of heart failure .",
    "stage c describes patients with structural heart disease who have prior or current symptoms of heart failure ; it includes nyha class i , ii ( slight limitation of physical activity ) , iii ( marked limitation of physical activity ) and iv ( unable to carry on any physical activity without symptoms of heart failure , or symptoms of heart failure at rest ) .",
    "stage d describes patients with refractory heart failure who require specialized interventions ; it includes nyha class iv .",
    "interventions at each stage are aimed at reducing risk factors ( stage a ) , treating structural heart disease ( stage b ) and reducing morbidity and mortality ( stages c and d ) @xcite .",
    "the input to the system is a patient s information , including demographics , history , daily symptoms , risks and measurements , as well as accf / aha stage and nyha class .",
    "when queried for a treatment recommendation , our system is able to give recommendations according to the guideline just as a physician would .",
    "our system is designed for running on top of the s(asp ) system , a goal - directed , predicate asp system that can be thought of as prolog extended with negation based on the stable model semantics @xcite .",
    "because of the goal - directed nature of the system , only the particular treatments applicable to the patient are reported by the system . with minor changes , our system will also work with traditional sat - based implementations such as clasp @xcite .",
    "however , these systems will compute the entire model , so if there are multiple treatments for a given condition , they will all be included in the answer set ( these differences between goal - directed and sat - based solvers are explained in @xcite ) .    to implement the chf guidelines in asp , we first extensively studied the guidelines to extract reasoning templates .",
    "these templates can be thought of as general knowledge patterns .",
    "these patterns were next deployed to code the chf guideline rules .",
    "our research makes two major contributions :    1 .",
    "we develop a system that completely automates the entire set of guidelines for chf management developed by the american college of cardiology foundation and american heart association .",
    "the system takes its input from ( i ) a patient s electronic health record that includes demographic information , test results , etc . , and ( ii ) a telemedicine system that provides data about vital signs ( heart rate , blood pressure , weight , etc .",
    "it then uses this information to recommend a treatment .",
    "the s(asp ) system also supports abduction , thus our system can also be used for abductive reasoning : a physician can , for example , figure out the symptoms that a particular patient must have in order for a given treatment to work .",
    "we develop a set of general knowledge patterns that were used to realize our automated physician - advisory system and that can be helpful in translating rules expressed in a natural language into asp for any application domain .",
    "a large number of software systems have been designed to address chf . however , none of them are designed to automatically advise physicians based on the accf / aha guidelines .",
    "chronic disease management systems designed thus far fall into seven categories @xcite : accessibility , care management , point - of - care functions , decision support , patient self - management , population management , and reporting .",
    "the automation of these functionalities is certainly helpful in assisting health care providers with managing patients with chronic conditions , however , none of them cover what we have realized : a physician advisory system that automates the application of clinical practice guidelines . as mentioned earlier , our physician advisory system for chf management codes all the knowledge in the 2013 accf / aha guideline for the management of heart failure @xcite as an answer set program .",
    "our system is able to recommend treatments just like a human physician who is strictly following these guidelines .",
    "additionally , our system is able to recommend treatments even when a patient s information is incomplete .",
    "the input to our system is the patient s information which includes demographics , history , daily symptoms , known risk factors , measurements as well as accf / aha stage and nyha class @xcite .",
    "the inputs to our system are summarized in table [ tab : input ] .",
    "a physician uses our system by posing a query to it .",
    "our system then processes the query by essentially simulating the thinking process of a chf specialist ( represented by the accf / aha guideline ) .",
    ".input of the physician - advisory system for chf management [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : output ]    there are some sixty odd rules in the 2013 accf / aha guideline for the management of heart failure .",
    "all of these rules are coded in asp to run on the s(asp ) system @xcite .",
    "for example , take one rule from accf / aha stage b @xcite :    in s(asp ) , this rule will be coded as shown below .",
    "note that prolog conventions are followed ( variables begin with an upper case letter ) .    ....",
    "recommendation(beta_blockers , class_1):- accf_stage(b ) ,       history_of_mi_or_acs , measurement(lvef , data ) ,      reduced_ef(data ) , not contraindication(beta_blockers ) .",
    "....    due to using asp as the modeling formalism , our system is able to handle complex scenarios . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider a situation in which we have a patient who has heart failure with reduced ejection fraction ( hfref ) and is in accf / aha stage c. according to the guideline @xcite our system would recommend the use of beta blockers .",
    "however , if we add the information that the patient has a history of fluid retention , then our system would try to add diuretics due to the following rule : `` in patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention , beta blockers should not be prescribed without diuretics '' @xcite .",
    "however , if diuretics are contraindicated for any reason , then our system will not recommend beta blockers either .",
    "our software system has been tested in - house and outputs found to be consistent with our interpretation of the rules .",
    "more extensive testing and a clinical trial are planned in the near future in collaboration with medical doctors who are chf specialists .",
    "our system can also perform abductive reasoning thanks to the s(asp ) system s support for abduction @xcite .",
    "abductive reasoning is a form of logical inference where one attempts to augment a theory with sufficient information to explain an observation ( the augmentations come from a set of predicates that are declared as _ abducibles _ ) . to illustrate , consider the following two rules in the accf / aha guideline @xcite :    * combination of hydralazine & isosorbide dinitrate",
    "is recommended to reduce morbidity & mortality for patients self - described as african americans with nyha class iii - iv hfref receiving optimal therapy with ace inhibitors & and beta blockers , unless contraindicated .",
    "* combination of hydralazine & isosorbide dinitrate should not be used for the treatment of hfref in patients who have no prior use of standard neurohormonal antagonist therapy .",
    "suppose we have an african american patient who is suffering from nyha class iii hfref , but that is all we know about the patient .",
    "since a hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate combination is highly effective in reducing the mortality of african americans with hfref , the physician might pose the following query :    ?",
    "-recommendation((hydralazine_and_isosorbide_dinitrate ) , class_1 )    to the s(asp ) system .",
    "the system would return the results shown in figure [ fig : abduction result ] .",
    "\\{accf_stage(c ) , hf_with_reduced_ef , history(standard_neurohormonal_antagonist_therapy ) , nyha_class(3 ) , nyha_class_3_to_4 , race(african_american ) , recommendation(hydralazine_and_isosorbide_dinitrate , class_1 ) , not contraindication(hydralazine_and_isosorbide_dinitrate ) }    note that the system abduced two things : ( i ) a  history of standard neurohormonal antagonist therapy \" , and ( ii ) the absence of  contraindication of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate \" .",
    "this means in order for us to recommend hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate to the patient , they must have received standard neurohormonal antagonist therapy before .",
    "otherwise , hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate would be contraindicated .",
    "the accf / aha guidelines are written in english and are quite complex . our task was to code these guidelines in asp . to simplify our task , we developed reasoning templates that we call knowledge patterns .",
    "these knowledge patterns are quite general and serve as solid building blocks for systematically translating the specifications written in english to asp .",
    "while developing these knowledge patterns and coding them in asp , certain facts had to be noted : ( i ) multiple rules can lead to the recommendation of a treatment ; ( ii ) multiple rules can lead to contraindication of a treatment ; ( iii ) a treatment can not be recommended if at least one contraindication for that treatment is present ; and , ( iv ) a given treatment recommendation can impact the recommendation and/or contraindication of other treatments .",
    "next , we present the most salient knowledge patterns that we have developed .",
    "many of these patterns are straightforward , however , some of them , such as the concomitant choice rule , are intricate .",
    "we present these patterns at a high level and ignore non - essential details .    *",
    "1 . aggressive reasoning : * the aggressive reasoning pattern can be stated as `` take an action ( e.g. , recommend treatment ) if there is a reason ;",
    "no evidence of danger means there is no danger in taking that action '' .",
    "the aggressive reasoning pattern is coded as follows :    ....          recommendation(choice ) : - preconditions(choice ) ,               not contraindication(choice ) .",
    "contraindication(choice ) : - dangers(choice ) .",
    "....    the code above makes use of negation as failure .",
    "if the contraindication of a choice can not be proved , and the conditions for making the choice hold , then that choice is recommended .",
    "an example of this knowledge pattern can be found in @xcite : `` digoxin can be beneficial in patients with hfref , unless contraindicated , to decrease hospitalizations for hf . ''",
    "it is realized in our system as shown below .    ....",

    "conservative reasoning : * this reasoning pattern is stated as `` a reason for a recommendation is not enough ; evidence that the recommendation is not harmful must be available '' .",
    "the conservative reasoning pattern is coded as follows :    ....          recommendation(choice ) : - preconditions(choice ) ,               not contraindication(choice ) .",

    "this coding pattern requires evidence of the absence of danger . without such evidence",
    ", the choice would be considered contraindicated .",
    "note that the `` - '' operator indicates classical negation .",

    "the system encodes as asp rules the official guidelines from 2013 , which rely on a huge body of clinical evidence and experience , and consist on more than 60 rules .",
    "it has not been fielded .",
    "a clinical trial is planned .",
    "the authors are aware of some limitations of the system , e.g. the lack of justification of the recommendations tat it outputs .",
    "this is included in the plan for future work .",
    "+ a large part of the paper is devoted to recurring reasoning templates , or knowledge patterns , and their encoding as asp rules .",
    "this is explained with abundant examples , which do not go into unnecessary detail .",
    "the paper also discusses how the application supports abduction . the knowledge pattern and abduction techniques are likely generalizable to other domains of reasoning .",
    "+ in general , the paper is well - written and easy to follow .",
    "expertise in medicine or in asp is not required . + * authors response to comment # 1 : * the reviewer seems to like the paper overall ( thanks ! ) , and is not recommending any changes .",
    "no action taken .",
    "* reviewer 2 , comment # 1 : * + the authors present an asp - based software system to implement various standardized treatment recommendations for people with chronic heart failures ( chf ) .",
    "the given list of recommendations published by the american heart association and the american college of cardiology foundation ( accf ) gets revamped quite frequently and it is very hard for physicians to keep informed of the current version as well as to have a proper overview of all eventualities and options provided by this list . due to the rule - like nature of the advice ,",
    "it is a natural approach to use a rule - based formalism which can reason over incomplete data .",
    "so the authors propose this answer set programming ( asp ) based approach in their advisory system .",
    "+ overall i do like the idea to use asp to capture all the different patterns of knowledge to reason about the applicability of different recommendations .",
    "the different kinds of rules are presented very extensively , with quite long examples for each kind of possible way to formulate a rule .",
    "that is one point where i see some potential to shorten the paper a little bit , as these rule - types do not seem to be something novel ( i.e. i see them as standard modelling techniques ) .",
    "this brings me to one big concern about the paper , which is the overall length of the paper .",
    "the cfp clearly states that the paper must not exceed 14 pages incl .",
    "the current paper exceeds that limit by exactly one page .",
    "+ * response to comment # 1 : * + the paper has been shortened by one page to fit within conference page limits .",
    "this has been achieved by removing redundant text as well as tightening the text in various places .",
    "2 .   * reviewer 2 , comment # 2 : * + another question arises when reading section 2 of the paper .",
    "there the authors state that the encoding may also be used with other available asp - solver , like clasp . in addition they claim that while in s(asp ) they would only get one answer due to the fact that s(asp ) does not compute the entire model , while other solvers may compute only one answer set with all treatment options which would apply .",

    "i am not sure if it is an misunderstanding of the one sentence in section 2 or some other information which is just missing in the paper .",
    "so please explain what is meant and how it works differently ( if that is the case ) .",
    "+ * response to comment # 2 : * + regarding using the encoding with other asp solvers , this use does require minor changes to the code ( that take only a few minutes ) before it can be run on clasp or other solvers .",
    "+ regarding the issue of computing the entire model , the reviewer seems to have a misunderstanding .",
    "first , the s(asp ) system can generate multiple ( distinct ) answer sets .",
    "however , since a goal - directed system produces partial answer set ( i.e. , subset of an answer set ) , then given a query , the same answer set may manifest itself multiple times as multiple partial answer sets . consider an example program : + p(1 ) .",
    "+ under clasp , there will be only one answer set : @xmath0p(1 ) , p(2)@xmath1 .",
    "however , in a goal - directed system , the query ? - p(x ) will produce two answers : first p(1 ) and then p(2 ) upon backtracking .",
    "both computed answers are parts of the same answer set .",

    "when looking at section 2 about half of the section is talking about the usage of asp for the newly introduced system .",
    "i think the discussion about asp and why it is reasonable to use this formalism is at a proper position .",
    "just the transition is a little bit surprising and should be done in a smoother way ( e.g. talk about it in the last paragraph of section 1 or using the argument of complex rule - like advises , negation as failure , incomplete information , ... as preconditions which make the use of asp so appealing ) .",
    "+ * response to comment # 3 : * + the reviewer is right .",
    "we have made the transition smoother . as suggested by the reviewer , we have moved the discussion about advantages of using asp for building our system from section 2 to the end of section 1 .",

    "even some comparison to existing software approaches would have been nice .",

    "this is primarily because our system can run on any asp system , and performance is not the main issues .",
    "additionally , the s(asp ) system is a research prototype and so while most queries that we posed finished in a few minutes , we do not really want to make performance a focus , as our main concern is that an answer is produced in a reasonable amount of time . on the clasp system ,",
    "almost all queries run in a few seconds or less .",
    "+ we have added more clarifications about preliminary test , namely , that the system has been tested in - house , and that validation of the system on real patient input in collaboration with medical doctors is planned . a clinical trial is also planned .",

    "<S> it is not even clear whether it is humanly possible to follow these guidelines due to their length and complexity . in the case of chf management , the guidelines run nearly 80 pages . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we describe a physician - advisory system for chf management that codes the entire set of clinical practice guidelines for chf using answer set programming . our approach is based on developing reasoning templates ( that we call knowledge patterns ) and using these patterns to systemically code the clinical guidelines for chf as asp rules . </S>",
    "<S> use of the knowledge patterns greatly facilitates the development of our system . </S>",
    "<S> given a patient s medical information , our system generates a recommendation for treatment just as a human physician would , using the guidelines . </S>",
    "<S> our system will work even in the presence of incomplete information . </S>",
    "<S> our work makes two contributions : ( i ) it shows that highly complex guidelines can be successfully coded as asp rules , and ( ii ) it develops a series of knowledge patterns that facilitate the coding of knowledge expressed in a natural language and that can be used for other application domains . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is under consideration for acceptance in tplp .    </S>",
