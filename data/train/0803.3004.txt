    "understanding the influence of the environment onto the non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum systems remains one of the challenging questions of theoretical physics . a finite number of quantum mechanical degrees of freedom  an orbit , a spin or a qubit  interacting with a infinitely large bath of non - interacting bosons or fermions with a continuous energy spectrum , represents a typical class of model examples for such systems .",
    "these quantum impurity models appear to be at heart of a variety of different physical problems .",
    "traditionally , they were used to describe the interaction of magnetic impurities within a metallic host@xcite or to investigate the dissipation in quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "these models have contributed immensely to our understanding of the low temperature properties of single - electron transistors@xcite and the tunneling spectroscopy of adatoms on metal surfaces.@xcite in addition , within the dynamical mean - field theory@xcite or its cluster extensions@xcite lattice models for strongly correlated fermions have been mapped onto quantum impurity problems embedded in a fictitious , self - consistent bath .",

    "the immense difficulty of treating the real - time dynamics of quantum impurity systems stems from the need to track the full time evolution of the density operator of the entire system  environment plus impurity .",
    "the kadanoff - baym and keldysh techniques  @xcite provide an elegant platform for perturbative expansions of the density operator .",
    "one of the building blocks of such perturbative expansions are non - equilibrium green functions .",
    "these non - equilibrium green functions also contain information on the transients as well as the steady - state which might be reached in the long time limit for a time - independent hamiltonian .",
    "in general , however , perturbative approaches are plagued by the infra - red divergences caused by degeneracies on the impurity , making them inadequate for tackling the change of ground states of quantum impurity models@xcite .    in this paper , we present a different approach for the calculation of non - equilibrium green functions of quantum impurity problems .",
    "we make use of wilson s numerical renormalization - group ( nrg ) method@xcite and its recent extension to non - equilibrium dynamics@xcite .",
    "spin - spin non - equilibrium spectral functions obtained by a nrg calculations were investigated first by costi about ten years ago in the context of the spin - boson model@xcite . here , we are interested in the evolution of fermionic spectral functions .",
    "we address this problem with a different approach using the complete basis set of the wilson chain @xcite derived in the context of the time - dependent numerical renormalization group @xcite ( td - nrg ) .",

    ", we will derive a numerical renormalization group approach based on scattering states to describe current - carrying open quantum systems . in this formulation , the current at finite bias is determined by the steady - state non - equilibrium ( neq ) spectral function@xcite which depends on the density operator of the full system . at finite bias , however , the neq density operator is only known analytically for hamiltonians which commute with the number operator of left and right - moving electrons,@xcite i.e.  for non - interacting quantum impurities .",
    "this analytically known operator @xmath6 must be evolved into the unknown neq density operator @xmath16 after switching on a finite coulomb repulsion @xmath2 .",

    "this is the basic underlying assumption of the perturbation theory in the coulomb interaction @xmath2@xcite .",
    "therefore , the steady - state spectral function obtained from a time - evolved density operator should be equivalent to the spectra obtained directly by an equilibrium nrg calculation@xcite .",
