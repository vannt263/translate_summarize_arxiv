    "one can eliminate the `` @xmath55 '' in ( [ eq : asymp ] ) by applying the proof of a non - compact version of the calabi conjecture in  ( * ? ? ?",

    "one can probably eliminate the restriction to khler classes in @xmath19 .",
    "r. goto was able to do this in the special case of a crepant resolution of a sasaki cone .",
    "one motivation for doing this is that many of the examples @xmath21 , such as a smoothing of a singularity , will be stein . and in this case @xmath56 , since @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "so theorem  [ thm : main ] just produces a ricci - flat metric in the trivial khler class .",
    "note that if @xmath21 is stein , e.g. @xmath21 is an affine variety , then there is a cohomologically trivial khler metric .",
    "so there is no difficulty finding a khler class in @xmath19 .",
    "of course it is desirable to remove the condition ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "but the author does not know how to construct the approximating metric in the proof without it .",
    "this work was inspired by interesting recent results on irregular sasaki - einstein manifolds such as the solution of the problem of the existence of sasaki - einstein structures on toric sasaki manifolds by a. futaki , h. ono , and g. wang  @xcite .    for a source of examples we consider deformations of isolated toric gorenstein singularities .",
    "it is known  @xcite that such a singularity itself has a nice ricci - flat khler metric which is a metric cone @xmath59 over a sasaki - einstein manifold @xmath5 .",
    "the versal deformation space of an isolated toric gorenstein singularity was constructed by k. altmann  @xcite .",
    "these singularities are rigid in dimensions @xmath60 , but there are many interesting examples in dimension 3 .",
    "[ cor : main ] let @xmath21 be a small deformation of an isolated toric gorenstein singularity . if @xmath21 is smooth , then it admits a complete ricci - flat khler metric as in theorem  [ thm : main ] which is invariant under a @xmath61-action .",
    "note the deformed space @xmath21 is no longer toric but admits a @xmath62-action .",
    "corollary  [ cor : main ] parallels that of the author in  @xcite and  @xcite where it is proved that certain crepant resolutions of isolated toric gorenstein singularities admit ricci - flat khler metrics which are asymptotic to the cone metric on @xmath59 .",
    "because of the @xmath61-action , the moment map construction of m. gross  @xcite produces special lagrangian fibrations on the examples produced in corollary  [ cor : main ] .",
    "these fibrations were studied in  @xcite ; the contribution here is in proving the existence of the calabi - yau metric .",
    "one motivation for studying this problem is the conjecture , due to s .- t .",
    "yau , that if @xmath21 is a complete ricci - flat khler manifold with finite topology , then @xmath0 where @xmath6 is a compact khler orbifold and @xmath2 supports @xmath63 .",
    "another motivation is the construction of complete ricci - flat khler metrics which are asymptotic to the khler cone @xmath59 of a sasaki - einstein manifold @xmath5 .",
    "some explicit examples are given in  @xcite of ricci - flat khler metrics on resolutions of ricci - flat khler cones @xmath59 .",
    "the author has considered the general existence problem in  @xcite , and given further families of examples in  @xcite .",
    "this case is somewhat easier than that considered in this article .",
    "in particular , the technical assumption ( [ cond ] ) is not needed .",
    "these asymptotically conical calabi - yau metrics are of interest in the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . here",
    "one considers a stack of d - branes at the singularity of the calabi - yau cone , and it is useful to work with calabi - yau resolutions of this singularity .",
    "in fact , one of the motivations of this work is that the problem of finding a ricci - flat khler metric on an affine variety is complimentary to the problem of finding such a metric on a resolution of a singularity .",
    "there are two ways of smoothing a ricci - flat khler cone @xmath64 .",
    "one can possibly find a crepant resolution @xmath65 . or one may be able to analytically deform @xmath6 to a smooth variety @xmath66 .",
    "when both of these exist , this is an example of a _ geometric transition _ which are of interest to physicists and mathematicians studying calabi - yau manifolds  @xcite .",
    "the familiar example is that of the quadric cone @xmath67 which is known to admit a small resolution @xmath68 and a smoothing @xmath66 where all three of these manifolds are known to admit ricci - flat khler metrics  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : examp ]",
    "an example is given where @xmath6 is the cone over @xmath69 , the two - points blow - up .",
    "the total space of the canonical bundle of @xmath69 gives a resolution @xmath68 of @xmath6 , and @xmath6 can also be deformed to a smooth affine variety @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main ] shows that both @xmath68 and @xmath66 have ricci - flat khler metrics .",
    "this example is simplest case in corollary  [ cor : main ] which gives a new ricci - flat manifold .",
    "we then consider an infinite class of three dimensional toric khler cones possessing a symmetry which were previously considered by the author in a different context  @xcite .",
    "they admit large families of smooth deformations and therefore provide an infinite family of ricci - flat manifolds which are smoothings of toric gorenstein singularities .",
    "one can construct many more examples of three dimensional toric cones with non - trivial deformations by taking minkowski sums of simple polygons .",
    "many of these , via corollary  [ cor : main ] , should give new examples of affine varieties with ricci - flat khler metrics .",
    "we will denote line bundles in boldface , @xmath72 , etc .",
    "while the corresponding divisor classes are denoted , @xmath73 , etc .",

    "the same notation will be used for the analogous notions of v - bundles and baily divisors on orbifolds ( cf .",
    "the total space of the line bundle @xmath74 minus the zero section will be denoted by @xmath75 .",
    "this work was inspired by a conversation with james sparks at the sugadaira conference in 2007 .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organizers for the opportunity to participate in the conference .",
    "we review here some results from sasakian geometry . for more details see  @xcite ,  @xcite , or the comprehensive monograph  @xcite .",
    "a riemannian manifold @xmath76 is sasakian if the metric cone @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , is a khler manifold .",

    "regular_. if the orbits of @xmath84 do not close , then the sasaki structure is _",
    "irregular_. in this case the closure of the one parameter subgroup of the isometry group generated by @xmath84 is a torus @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the automorphism group of the sasaki structure .",

    "it follows from ( [ eq : cont ] ) that the khler form of @xmath77 is @xmath103 thus @xmath104 is a khler potential for @xmath105 .",
    "there is a 1-dimensional foliation @xmath106 generated by the reed vector field @xmath84 .",
    "since the leaf space is identical with that generated by @xmath83 on @xmath59 , @xmath106 has a natural transverse holomorphic structure .",

    "then set @xmath110 then @xmath111 for sufficiently small @xmath112 , @xmath113 is a non - degenerate contact form in that @xmath114 is nowhere zero",

    "@xmath76 is sasaki - einstein with the einstein constant being necessarily @xmath119 .",
    "@xmath77 is a ricci - flat khler .",
    "the khler structure on the leaf space of @xmath106 is khler - einstein with einstein constant @xmath120 .",
    "this follows from elementary computations .",
    "in particular , the equivalence of ( i ) and ( iii ) follows from @xmath121 where @xmath122 are lifts of @xmath123 in the local leaf space .",
    "we will make use of a slight generalization of the sasaki - einstein condition .",

    "in fact , this condition is equivalent to the transverse khler - einstein condition @xmath129 , since this implies by the the same argument that proves proposition  [ prop : ricci ] that @xmath130 and conversely .    given a sasaki structure we can perform a @xmath2-homothetic transformation to get a new sasaki structure .",
    "for @xmath131 set @xmath132 then @xmath133 is a sasaki structure with the same holomorphic structure on @xmath59 , and with @xmath134 .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 is @xmath91-einstein with @xmath135 . a simple computation involving ( [ eq : ricci ] ) , @xmath136 and @xmath137 shows that the @xmath2-homothetic transformation gives an @xmath91-einstein sasaki structure with @xmath138 if @xmath18 is @xmath91-einstein with @xmath139 , then a @xmath2-homothetic transformation with @xmath140 gives a sasaki - einstein metric @xmath141 .",
