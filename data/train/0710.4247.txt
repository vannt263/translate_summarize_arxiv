    "almost two decades ago weinberg formulated his ideas to extend chiral perturbation theory to systems with several nucleons @xcite .",
    "this seminal work initiated extensive research towards better understanding of the structure of nuclear forces and the dynamics of few- and many - nucleon systems based on the powerful framework of effective field theory ( eft ) . in this",
    "talk i outline the current status of chiral eft for nuclear forces and applications in the few - nucleon sector .",
    "i discuss the structure of the subleading contributions to the three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) and the leading four - nucleon force ( 4nf ) which are currently being investigated .",
    "the role of @xmath0-excitation will also be addressed . the last part of this talk concerns lattice simulations of light nuclei .",
    "chiral eft is an appropriate framework to analyze the properties of few - nucleon systems at low energy .",
    "it is based on the most general effective lagrangian for goldstone bosons ( pions ) and matter fields ( nucleons and perhaps deltas ) consistent with the chiral symmetry of qcd . for energies below the pion - production threshold , a nonrelativistic treatment of the nucleons",
    "is justified .",
    "further , it is advantageous to eliminate the pionic degrees of freedom which gives rise to the ( nonlocal ) nuclear hamiltonian @xmath1 the resulting quantum - mechanical @xmath2-body problem can be dealt with using rigorous few - body techniques or many - body methods .",
    "the derivation of the nuclear potentials from the effective lagrangian can be carried out straightforwardly utilizing the so - called chiral expansion .",
    "the importance of a particular contribution to the nuclear hamiltonian is determined by the corresponding power of the expansion parameter @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to the generic low - momentum scale associated with external nucleon momenta or @xmath6 and the pertinent hard scale , respectively @xcite .",
    "for the two - nucleon force ( 2nf ) , this expansion has the form @xmath7 where the subscripts refer to the chiral order .",
    "the leading contribution @xmath8 is due to @xmath9-exchange ( ope ) and two nn contact interactions without derivatives .",
    "the corrections result from contact interactions with increasing number of derivatives and/or insertions of @xmath10 and exchange of pions .",
    "in particular , @xmath11-exchange starts to contribute at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and provides an important ingredient of the nuclear force @xcite .",
    "at present , the 2nf has been worked out and applied in the nn system at next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath12lo ) @xcite , see @xcite for the pioneering work along this line .",
    "its long - range part involves contributions from @xmath9- @xmath11- and @xmath13-exchange and is parameter - free since the corresponding low - energy constants ( lecs ) are known from @xmath14 scattering .",
    "numerically , the @xmath13-exchange potential turns out to be negligibly small @xcite .",
    "the short - range part consists of 24 independent contact interactions whose strengths were determined from fits to nn low - energy data , see ref .",
    "@xcite for the discussion on resonance saturation of the corresponding lecs .",
    "both n@xmath12lo calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite yield compatible results for the nn system ( within the theoretical uncertainty ) and demonstrate an accurate description of the low - energy scattering data and the deuteron properties .",
    "systems with three- and more nucleons provide an excellent testing ground for chiral nuclear forces and were extensively studied in this framework over the past few years .",
    "chiral power counting explains naturally the observed hierarchy of nuclear forces @xmath15 with @xmath16 the first nonvanishing contribution to the 3nf appears at n@xmath17lo relative to the leading 2nf and results from @xmath11-exchange , @xmath9-exchange with 2n contact interaction and the purely short - range 3n contact term . while the @xmath11-exchange contribution is parameter - free , the two other topologies depend on the unknown lecs @xmath18 and @xmath19 which were fitted to the @xmath12h binding energy and @xmath20 doublet scattering length @xcite and to the combinations of the @xmath12h/@xmath21he @xcite and @xmath12h/@xmath22b @xcite binding energies .",
    "the resulting nuclear hamiltonian was extensively tested in the 3n continuum @xcite and applied to study the properties of light nuclei using the no - core shell model approach @xcite .",
    "the calculated 3n scattering observables are generally in a reasonable agreement with the data which improves when going from nlo to n@xmath17lo , see e.g.  the left and middle panels in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "1 true cm     scattering at 10 mev ( left panel ) and 65 mev ( middle panel ) at nlo ( light - shaded bands ) and n@xmath17lo ( dark - shaded bands ) .",
    "references to data can be found in @xcite .",
    "right panel shows @xmath23 breakup cross section ( in mb mev@xmath24 sr@xmath25 ) along the kinematical locus s at 19 mev nucleon energy in the scre configuration with @xmath26 @xcite . dashed and dashed - dotted lines are results based on the cd bonn 2000 2nf @xcite combined with the tm99 3nf @xcite and the coupled channel calculation including the explicit @xmath0 and the coulomb interaction @xcite , respectively .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    notice however that the theoretical uncertainty at n@xmath17lo appears to be rather large already at moderate energies , see the middle panel in fig .",
    "we further emphasize that there are certain observables for which remarkably large discrepancies with the data are found even at very low energy .",
    "a well - known example is the so - called symmetric space - star ( sst ) @xmath27 breakup configuration at @xmath28 mev @xcite , in which the plane in the c.m .",
    "system spanned by the outgoing nucleons is perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "recently , @xmath23 data for a similar symmetric constant relative - energy configuration have been measured at @xmath29 mev @xcite .",
    "this geometry is characterized by the angle @xmath30 between the beam axis and the plane in the c.m .",
    "system spanned by the outgoing nucleons .",
    "similar to the sst geometry , one observes large deviations between the theory and the data , see right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which also hold for calculations based on modern phenomenological potentials .",
    "the included 3nfs have little effect on the cross section while the effect of the coulomb interaction is significant but removes only a part of the discrepancy . for more details on these and",
    "related topics the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite , see also ref .",
    "although the results for few - nucleon observables already look quite promising at n@xmath17lo , it is mandatory to extend these studies to n@xmath12lo as it has already been done for the 2n system .",
    "this would allow one to test the convergence of the chiral expansion and might shed some light on the long - standing puzzles in the 3n continuum .",
    "the extension to n@xmath12lo requires the incorporation of the leading corrections to the 3nf which feed into five different topologies , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and are currently being worked out .    1 true cm    lo .",
    "solid and dashed lines represent nucleons and pions , respectively .",
    "solid dots denote the leading - order vertices .",
    "[ fig2 ] , width=472 ]    interestingly , there are no contributions from higher - order vertices in the effective lagrangian ( except @xmath31-corrections ) so that the 3nf at n@xmath12lo is parameter - free .",
    "notice further that the spin - space structure of the chiral 3nf at n@xmath12lo is much richer than the one of the currently available 3nf models .",
    "partial results are already available for certain types of contributions . in particular , one - loop and relativistic @xmath31-corrections to the @xmath11-exchange topology were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite based on the av18 2nf @xcite indicate that the one - loop @xmath11-exchange corrections have little effect on 3n scattering observables .",
    "in addition to the 3nf corrections , four - nucleon force ( 4nf ) starts to contribute at n@xmath12lo in the chiral expansion .",
    "it has been worked out recently using the method of unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "the leading 4nf results from diagrams depicted in fig .",

    "see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    graphs are shown which yield nonvanishing contributions .",
    "it is governed by the exchange of pions and the lowest - order nucleon - nucleon contact interaction and includes effects due to the nonlinear pion - nucleon couplings and the pion self - interactions constrained by the chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "the obtained 4nf is local and does not contain any unknown parameters .",
    "the expectation values of the individual 4nf contributions obtained in the pioneering study of ref .",
    "@xcite are typically of the order of few hundreds of kev , which agrees with estimations based on dimensional arguments .",
    "one also observes strong cancellations between individual contributions .",
    "the @xmath0-isobar is known to play an important role in hadronic and nuclear physics due to its low excitation energy , @xmath32 mev , and strong coupling to the @xmath14 system .",
    "it can , therefore , be argued that the explicit inclusion of the delta allows one to resum a certain class of important contributions and thus leads to an improved convergence as compared to the delta - less theory .",
    "indeed , it is well known that e.g.  the lecs @xmath33 accompanying the subleading @xmath34 vertices are saturated by the @xmath0-isobar which leads to their rather large numerical values @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the subleading @xmath11-exchange 2nf turns out to be much stronger than the leading one @xcite .",
    "a similar tendency was also found for the @xmath35-exchange @xcite and the charge - symmetry breaking @xmath11-exchange potentials @xcite . in eft with explicit deltas , the dominant portion of these large subleading contributions",
    "is shifted to the lower chiral order leading to a more natural convergence pattern .",
    "the explicit inclusion of the delta in chiral eft can be achieved via the so - called small scale expansion ( sse ) @xcite in which @xmath36 is treated as an additional small parameter .",
    "the leading contributions to the 2nf due to intermediate @xmath0 excitations arise at nlo from diagrams shown in the first raw of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and were considered in @xcite",
    ".    1 true cm    lo ( second raw ) contributions to the @xmath11-exchange 2nf with single and double @xmath0 excitations .",
    "double lines represent @xmath0-isobars , filled squares denote subleading vertices . for remaining notation",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , width=340 ]    in @xcite we worked out the subleading contributions which are generated at n@xmath17lo by diagrams depicted in the second raw of fig .",

    "this was achieved by fitting the threshold coefficients of @xmath14 scattering calculated at second order in the sse .",
    "as expected , we found that the values of the lecs @xmath33 are reduced in magnitude in the theory with explicit @xmath0 s . using the su(4 ) ( or large @xmath40 ) value for the leading @xmath37 lec @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the nucleon axial - vector coupling",
