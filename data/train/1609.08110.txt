    "originally launched in 2009 , nasa s _ kepler _ mission @xcite is responsible for the discovery of thousands of planetary candidates , including over 3000 confirmed planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) . through monitoring periodic changes in brightness of light curves from stars ( i.e. the `` transit method '' ) ,",
    "_ kepler _ is able to detect planets with radii on the order of 1 @xmath6 , although the majority of planets detected are so - called `` super - earths '' or `` sub - neptunes '' ( with radii @xmath7 , @xcite ) . of the thousands of planetary systems discovered by _",
    "kepler _ to date , @xmath8 are single - transit systems ( i.e. only one planet is observed to transit ) , while the other @xmath9 consist of 2 - 7 transiting planets ( @xcite ) .",
    "the multi - transit planet systems in the _ kepler _ sample populate dynamically cold orbits with low eccentricities and mutual inclinations ( @xmath10 ) . in particular , the eccentricities derived from transit timing variations ( ttvs ) are typically @xmath11 @xcite , while the transit durations of ensembles of multiple transiting planets can be well - fitted with a rayleigh distribution ( equation [ eq : sigma_e ] ) with mean values of @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite .    in contrast , the properties of the single - transit planet systems seem to be much less certain . @xcite first noted with preliminary _ kepler _ data that when modeling the mutual inclination distribution as a rayleigh function , they had difficulty fitting the large observed ratio of single transiting systems to multiple transiting systems .",
    "this  problem \" was later on referred to as the `` _ _ kepler _ _ dichotomy '' in several other studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "a wide range of studies into this problem have been undertaken with varying degrees of success ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a consistent picture is still missing .",
    "this dichotomy might not only be reflected on the derived occurrences between single and multiple planetary systems , but there is tentative evidence , possibly related to the occurrences through the planetary mutual inclinations , that at least a fraction of the single transiting planets in _ kepler _ occupy dynamically hotter orbits .",
    "first , @xcite find that the best fit to the transit durations of single transiting planets is a single rayleigh distribution with @xmath14 .",
    "second , by combining measurements of the star s rotation period , radius , and projected rotational velocity , @xcite found statistically significant evidence that multiple transiting systems to have lower stellar obliquity angles than their single transiting counterparts .",
    "this trend can be indicative of larger individual inclinations in the singles assuming that the initial invariable plane , where planets form , nearly coincides with the host star s equator .    a dozen of these dynamically hot close - in super - earth / neptune systems have also been discovered in the radial velocity surveys , often with giant planets companion further out ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "the mean , median and their 1-@xmath86 uncertainties is determined by bootstrapping the single planet population for 1000 realizations .",
    "this is slightly higher than the estimated value by @xcite , which it might be expected , since the observed single transit planet systems are likely to be a mixture between the single super - earths and the multiple super - earths systems with relatively high mutual inclinations , which have lower eccentricities .",
    "consequently , we have divided the samples with @xmath87 and @xmath88 in two : a lower mutual inclination sample ( at least one pair has @xmath89 ) and a larger mutual inclination sample ( all pairs @xmath90 ) .",
    "these cuts in mutual inclinations are meant as a rough proxy for transit probabilities  the former sample has a higher probability to be observed as multiple - transiting planetary systems than the latter .",
    "we observe that the systems in the larger mutual inclination sample have a wider distribution of eccentricity and obliquity : the median eccentricity ( obliquity ) in @xmath87 is @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , while for @xmath88 is @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "overall , the sample of systems that are more likely to be seen as single transiting ( @xmath95 plus @xmath96 with @xmath97 ) have a mean and median eccentricity ( obliquity angles ) of @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , respectively .    for comparison ,",

    "since the two planets system is a small fraction of the remaining systems ( table [ tab : results ] ) , the bulk of these low mutual inclination systems have similar properties as the _ kepler _ multiple systems , which are much more circular and coplanar , with an mean eccentricity upper limit of @xmath106 @xcite .",

    "the result is presented in figure [ fig : kappa ] .",
    "we obtain best fit @xmath107 value for our single super earths to be @xmath110 , which is consistent with the measurement of @xcite ( @xmath111 ) on _ kepler _ single systems using @xmath112 and rotation period of the host star .",
    "we also found @xmath113 for the population with two and three super - earths with @xmath114 .",
    "these systems are likely to be observed as a multiple transiting systems , which is tentatively similar to the @xmath115 derived by @xcite for the _ kepler _ multiple systems .    in summary ,",
    "the width of the eccentricity and stellar obliquity distributions shrink as a function of the number of super - earths and widen as a function of the mutual inclinations between planetary orbits . as a result ,",
    "a population of single transiting super - earths with eccentricities of @xmath116 and obliquity angles of @xmath117 are created .",
    "finally , we have identified a the class multiple planet systems with low mutual inclinations between the super - earths , but high large obliquity angles , similar to the kepler-56 system ( upper left region of the right panel of figure [ fig : inc_earthonly ] ) .",
    "however , systems like these , which would violate the trend that multiple transiting systems tend to have low obliquities , are somewhat uncommon . for reference ,",

    "we demonstrate the time evolution of one of the kepler-56-like systems in figure [ fig : orbit_tilt ] . in this example , the ejection of planet 2 , a giant planet , at 0.2myr has tilted the orbital plane of all the three super - earths all together , leading to large - amplitude inclination ( or , equivalently , obliquity ) oscillations between @xmath121 to @xmath122 , while keeping the mutual inclinations small ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the large oscillations in obliquity are likely due to a secular resonance affect : the forcing due to the innermost jupiter at @xmath124 au with timescale of @xmath125 yr nearly matches a natural precession frequency of the inner planets ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "this is mostly due to the perturbations of the systems with three super - earths with most eccentric outer giant planets .",

    "we caution that our mechanism does not aim to explain the",
    " _ kepler _ dichotomy \" , namely the excess of single transiting systems . given the relatively low occurrence rate of the giant planets ( @xmath174 , @xcite ) , the observed _ kepler _ single transiting systems are likely to be a mixture between the perturbed and unperturbed systems .",

    "our work explores the dynamical imprints that an unstable outer planetary system composed of three giant planets with final orbital configurations similar to the radial velocity sample can have on an inner system with three super - earths , similar to those observed in the _ _ k__epler sample .",
    "the main results of these experiments can be summarized as follows :    * the scattering events with the outer giant planets clear the inner super - earths in nearly half of the systems . for the remaining half of the systems , where at least one super - earth survives ,",
    "the multiplicity is greatly reduced : @xmath175 have only one super - earth , while @xmath176 have two super - earths ( see table [ tab : results ] ) . * the eccentricities and inclinations ( or , stellar obliquity angles ) of the surviving super - earths",
    "can be excited to large values ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and their distributions widen for systems with less planets and for systems with larger mutual inclinations in the case where 2 o 3 super - earths survived ( see figures [ fig : inc_earthonly ] and [ fig : obl_nearth ] ) .",
    "in particular , the eccentricities and obliquity angles of the single super - earths roughly follow a rayleigh distribution with @xmath177 and @xmath84 , respectively . *",
    "the simulations with outer giant planets decrease the relative frequency of observing higher multiplicity systems and lower multiplicity systems in transit by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "thus , the expected number of systems with n transiting planets relative to n-1 transiting planets can better reproduce the results from _ kepler _ ( the so - called kepler dichotomy , see figure [ fig : transits ] ) . *",
    "the eccentricity distribution of the outer giants shrinks as a function of number of surviving super - earths : the median decreases from @xmath178 for @xmath179 ( or 2 ) to to @xmath180 for @xmath181 .",
    "the median eccentricity of the systems with no se is flat in @xmath182 .    in",
    "what follows , we discuss our results in the context of recent observations and theoretical studies .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : e_i_se ] , the eccentricity and inclination distributions of the surviving super - earths widen for systems with less super - earths and for systems that have wider mutual inclinations , which are more likely to be observed as single transiting system .",
    "these predictions are in - line with recent observational evidences suggesting that _ kepler _ single systems are dynamically hot . in particular , the eccentricity distribution of our predicted single super - earths has a mean of @xmath183 . combined with the multiple planets with high mutual inclinations ,",
    "we reproduce a population of single transiting planet with mean eccentricities of @xmath184 similar to what it has been found by @xcite for _ kepler _ single systems .    similarly , by fitting a fischer distribution with parameter @xmath107",
    "we find that the best fit to the obliquity distribution of the single systems is @xmath185 , compared to @xmath186 found in @xcite . a similar calculation for the population of multi - planet systems with lower mutual inclinations ( @xmath187 , black likes in figure [ fig : obl_nearth ] ) yield @xmath188 , compared to @xmath189 found in @xcite .",
    "our experiment predicts that long term radial velocity follow up of _ kepler _ single systems will likely yield a population of giant planets beyond @xmath190 au , especially around those systems with transit durations that are unlikely to be explained by circular orbits .",
    "it would be difficult , however , for the _ kepler _ sample to measure the rate of such a mechanism happen , due to the relative faint nature of the planet hosting stars .",
    "future discoveries from _ tess _ and follow up studies will reveal the prevalence of this mechanism in shaping the dynamical properties of the single transiting planets .",
    "our model can reproduce the observed ratios of multiplicities in the _ kepler _ sample ( figure [ fig : transits ] ) and , therefore , it provides some contribution to the traditional  _ kepler _ dichotomy \" problem .",
    "however , our model , which relies on the presence of giant planets , can hardly account for the  dichotomy \" simply because there are not enough giant planets ( relative to inner super - earths ) to make up for a sizable contribution .",
    "moreover , the  _ kepler _ dichotomy \" problem persists in m stars @xcite , where giant planets are more infrequently found than in f and g stars @xcite .      there has been a wealth of recent theoretical work devoted to study the origin of the orbital architecture of the _ kepler _ planets . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss these works and the our relation ours .",
    "we separate these works in two broad categories : without and without outers perturbers .",
    "one possibility is that the excitation of eccentricities and inclinations occurs during the assembly process itself and its subsequent long - term evolution .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have studied the predictions from a model in which planets form after the gas disk has dissipated by mergers of embryos ( giant impact phase ) .",
    "these works predict an eccentricity distribution following an exponentially decaying function @xmath191 , while the simulations of @xcite find @xmath192 .",
    "such distribution might explain the eccentricities of the multiple transiting planets in the @xcite sample , but can hardly explain the large eccentricities ( @xmath116 ) of the single transiting planets .",
    "a similar approach to these studies of planet formation has also been carried by @xcite , in which by varying the mass distribution of the embryos , the authors can match some of the bulk the orbital configurations of the kepler systems .",
    "however , their calculations seem not excite the eccentricities to the levels required to explain the hot population of single transiting systems in @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite argued that there is evidence that the high multiplicity ( @xmath193 ) _ kepler _ systems are currently at the edge of stability suggesting that these systems might have become unstable in the past losing planets .",
    "even though the dynamical instability can reduce the multiplicity of the multiple planet systems , the unstable planets will most likely lead to planet mergers , not ejections , which would not effectively excite the eccentricities and inclinations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , the self - excitation of mutual inclinations in the compact systems is generally unable to bring planetary orbits out of transit and account for the excess of single transiting planets @xcite .    in summary",
    ", these previous studies suggest that either the assembly process of the multiple planet systems or their long - term evolution can only modestly excite the eccentricities and inclinations , and are unlikely to account for the population of eccentric single transiting planets .",
    "similar to our work , recent studies have invoked outer massive perturbers to shape the orbital configurations of the inner super - earths .",
    "@xcite studied whether an external inclined ( relative to the super - earths ) planet or star could excite the mutual inclinations of the multiple planet system , helping to account for the large number of single transiting planets .",
    "although some of the outer perturbers in our experiments can excite the mutual inclinations of the inner super - earths au ( figure [ fig : mass - final ] ) , while the ses are typically at @xmath194 ( figure [ fig : init - pratio ] ) meaning that the rigidity parameter @xmath195 .",
    "] , their inclinations relative to the super - earths that survive with 3 planets are typically relatively low ( @xmath196 ) to excite large mutual inclinations .",
    "moreover , we note that the inclinations of the outer jupiters anti - correlate with the number of surviving super - earths ( see figure [ fig : results ] ) , suggesting that scattering events that excites the largest inclinations of the outer giant planets efficiently removes the super - earths , possibly due to large eccentricity excitation of the jupiters .",
    "similar to @xcite , @xcite studied the effect of secular perturbations from outer giant planets in either inclined and/or eccentric orbits .",
    "he notes that both the excitation of large inclinations and the reduction in the numbers of super - earths can be efficient enough to account for the observed multiplicities for dynamically hot outer giant planets .",
    "in particular , his calculations with two giant planets show that these perturbations can efficiently remove most super - earths , which might be related to the high efficiency of super - earths removal in our experiments because the evolution of these planets after the ejection of one giant planet is mostly driven by the secular interactions with the giant planets",
    ".    the strong scattering events of the giant planet can produce highly eccentric planets ( @xmath197 ) that can strongly interact the inner _",
    "kepler_-like system .",
    "this idea has been explored by @xcite by placing the planets in eccentric orbits , crossing those of the super - earths , and noted that this could either reduce the number of super - earths in the system or change the semi - major axes of the jupiter dramatically forming a warm jupiter or ejecting it .",
    "we expect that our experiments mostly lead to the disruption of the inner planetary systems because the binding energies of the jupiters exceed those of the super - earths by a factor of @xmath198 .",
    "we caution , however , that we have not disentangled whether the reduction of planets in our experiments is due to close encounters with the giant planets like in the experiments by @xcite or by secular interactions like those in @xcite .",
    "similar to our work , @xcite recently studied the effect of outer giant planet scattering on inner multiple planet systems . unlike our work , the authors focused on the kepler-56 system and studied whether scattering can explain its large stellar obliquity ( @xmath199 , @xcite ) and low mutual inclination ( see figure [ fig : inc_earthonly ] ) .",
    "the authors show that their experiments with three outer giant planets produce large enough obliquity angles , while retaining low mutual inclinations between the kepler-56 b and c. our experiments also produce a population of kepler-56-like systems with large obliquity angles and low mutual inclinations ( see cluster of two- and three - planet systems around kepler 56 in figure [ fig : inc_earthonly ] ) .",
    "we note that our experiments consider inner super - earths with masses of @xmath200 , which are much smaller than those in the kepler-56 system ( b and c have masses of @xmath201 and @xmath202 ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that our experiments lose super - earths or excite mutual inclinations much more frequently than those experiments in @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite have carried out a similar suite of experiments than ours and studied , among other things , how outer giant planet scattering shapes the architectures of _",
    "kepler_-like inner planets .",
    "their calculations show that @xmath203 of the inner systems reduce their multiplicity , which is different from our results in which @xmath204 of the systems lose at least one planet ( see table 2 ) . in turn , the surviving planets in their calculations have significantly lower eccentricities and inclinations than those in our calculations .",
    "we mainly attribute these differences to the choice of the inner systems , which in @xcite these are typically more resilient ( typically more compact and closer - in ) to the perturbations from the outer giant planets than our systems .    in summary ,",
    "consistent with our findings , recent works show that the effect from having outer giants can dramatically change the orbital architecture of the inner super - earths . the final outcomes in different studies , however , depends critically on the compactness of the inner systems .",
    "we run n - body experiments to study the effect that from outer ( @xmath1 au ) giant planet companions can have on the orbital configurations of close - in super - earth multiple systems .",
    "we show that , the planet - planet scattering events that shapes the giant planets to have end orbital states resembles those of the systems discovered by radial velocity surveys , can excite the eccentricity and inclination of the super - earths . as a result ,",
    "about half of the inner multiple systems are completely destroyed , with a fraction of the remaining systems have their multiplicity reduced , producing a population of dynamically hot single super - earth systems .",
    "we predict these single super - earths to have mean eccentricities of @xmath183 and mean inclinations @xmath121 . as the multiplicity increases , the systems have lower eccentricity and mutual inclinations .",
    "the mean eccentricity @xmath184 of the systems that likely to be observed as single transiting planet is consistent with recent eccentricity measurements of _ kepler _ super - earths from transit durations @xcite .",
    "the obliquity distribution from this mechanism agrees with the tentative observation that single transiting systems have a wider distribution of stellar obliquity angles compared to the multiple transiting systems @xcite .",
