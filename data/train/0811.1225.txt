    "<S> it is well - known that the curie temperature , and hence the magnetization , in diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) like ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as can be controlled by changing the equilibrium density of holes in the material . here , we propose that even with a constant hole density , large changes in the magnetization can be obtained with a relatively small imbalance in the quasi - fermi levels for up - spin and down - spin electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we show , by coupling mean field theory of diluted magnetic semiconductor ferromagnetism with master equations governing the mn spin - dynamics , that a mere splitting of the up - spin and down - spin quasi - fermi levels by @xmath2mev will produce the effect of an external magnetic field as large as @xmath3 t as long as the alternative relaxation paths for mn spins ( i.e. spin - lattice relaxation ) can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the physics is similar to the classic overhauser effect , also called the dynamic nuclear polarization , with the mn impurities playing the role of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that a lateral spin - valve structure in anti - parallel configuration with a dms as the channel can be used to demonstrate this effect as quasi - fermi level splitting of such magnitude , inside the channel of similar systems , have already been experimentally demonstrated to produce polarization of paramagnetic impurity spins . </S>"
