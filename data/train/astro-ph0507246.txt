    "the detection of deviations indicated in the previous paragraph show the presence of some asymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "moreover , analyses in wavelet space in different regions ( north , south , northeast , northwest , southeast , southwest of the galactic plane ) performed by vielva et al . 2004 and cruz et al . 2005 indicate that the source of deviations might be a cold spot located at @xmath8 .",
    "the nature of the observed deviations is still not clear .",
    "the implementation and development of new statistical methods is indispensable to improve our understanding of the deviations from the standard inflationary model predictions , in particular those observed in the wmap data .",
    "there are many kinds of non - gaussianity , and each type may be sensitive to some statistical tests but immune to others .",
    "we need more types of tests , such as higher criticism in order to better understand non - gaussianity .",
    "the higher criticism ( @xmath9 ) statistic was first proposed in donoho & jin ( 2004 ) for testing a very subtle problem : given @xmath1 gaussian observations with same standard deviations but different means , we want to test whether @xmath1 means are all zeros versus the alternative that a small fraction of them is nonzero .",
    "the fraction of nonzero means is too small to have any effect on the bulk of the observations , so all statistics based on moments ( e.g. excess kurtosis ( @xmath10 ) ) would generally have no power for detection . with careful calibrations ,",
    "@xmath9 was proved to be optimal in detecting such situations .",
    "@xmath9 is also competitive for detection in other scenarios .",
    "an analysis of simulated cmb on flat patches of the sky using the @xmath9 statistics was presented in jin et al .",
    "the simulated images included cmb signals , as well as cosmic strings and sunyaev - zeldovich type emission .",
    "analyses were performed in wavelet and curvelet spaces ( cands & donoho 2000 ) .",
    "the very particular non - gaussianity introduced by the simulated effects , as well as the restricted size of the sample , resulted in the lower sensitivity of this method in comparison with the traditional @xmath10 statistic .",
    "however , theoretical studies indicate that the @xmath9 statistic will outperform the @xmath10 when the sample size gets larger .    besides its competitive detection power , @xmath9 is also valuable in identifying the origin of detected deviations , offering a way to determine which portion of the data contributes most to the deviation ; this property is not available for many other statistics such as @xmath10 . as mentioned above , analyses of the wmap data in wavelet space suggest that the source of the detected deviations is due to the cold temperatures of certain pixels within a spot located in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the @xmath9 test is especially sensitive to abnormally high amounts of moderately large observations and , as shown in this paper , its application to wmap data shows deviations from the predictions of the standard inflationary model . moreover , inspection of individual pixel @xmath9 values in the wmap data provides a direct means to identify the pixels at the source of the deviation . no additional region - by - region analysis is needed .",
    "the computational cost is therefore strongly reduced , making it a promising test for analyzing future higher resolution data , such as data from the planck mission .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the @xmath9 statistical test is described in detail in section 2 . a comparison between the performance of this statistic and that of the kurtosis ( @xmath10 ) and the maximum ( @xmath11 ) is included in subsection 2.1 .",
    "the wmap data is analyzed in real and wavelet spaces . a description of the combination of wmap data in different channels , the monte carlo simulations , and the process followed in wavelet space is included in section 3 .",
    "the analysis of the wmap data is presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is dedicated to conclusions and discussion .",
    "the @xmath9 statistic was first proposed in donoho & jin 2004 , jin 2004 . given @xmath1 independent observations of a distribution which is thought to be slightly deviated from the standard gaussian , one can compare the fraction of observed significances at a given @xmath12-level ( i.e. the number of observed values exceeding the upper-@xmath12 quantile of the standard gausian ) to the expected fraction under the standard gaussian assumption : @xmath13 the @xmath9 statistic is then defined as the maximum of the above quantities over all significance levels @xmath14 .",
    "given @xmath1 individual observations @xmath15 from a distribution which is thought to be symmetric and slightly deviated from the standard gaussian , there is a simpler equivalent form of hc defined as follows .",
    "first , we convert the individual @xmath15 s into individual @xmath16-values : @xmath17 , then we let @xmath18 denote the @xmath16-values sorted in ascending order , define : @xmath19 the @xmath9 statistic is then : @xmath20 or in a modified form : @xmath21 we let @xmath22 refer either to @xmath23 or @xmath24 whenever there is no confusion .",
    "the above definition is slightly different from that in donoho & jin 2004 , but the ideas are essentially the same .",
    "@xmath9 is useful in non - gaussianity detection when @xmath15 are truly from @xmath25 , with the result that @xmath26 is approximately distributed as @xmath25 for almost every @xmath27 .",
    "thus an unusually large @xmath23 or @xmath24 value strongly implies non - gaussianity .",
    "moreover , @xmath28 also provides _ localized _",
    "information on deviations from gaussianity .",
    "we can track down the source of non - gaussianity by studying which portion of the data gives unusually large @xmath28 .",
    "previous works have claimed the detection of deviations from the predictions of the standard inflationary model in the first year wmap data , using the @xmath10 statistic in wavelet space ( vielva et al .",
    "2004 , mukherjee & wang 2004 , mcewen et al .",
    "2004 ) . in order to establish a comparison between this statistic and the @xmath9 we will include calculations of @xmath10 in our analysis as well . for completeness",
    ", we will also use the so - called @xmath11 statistic .",
    "the definitions for these two statistics are provided below .",
    "a discussion about the theoretical power of the three statistics to detect deviations from gaussianity is included in the following subsection.@xmath29 , @xmath10 .",
    "for a ( symmetric ) random variable @xmath30 , @xmath10 is @xmath31}{(e[x^2])^2 } -3 $ ] , which uses the 4th moment to measure the departure from gaussianity .",
    "@xmath10 is useful in non - gaussianity detection as @xmath32 for large @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath11 . the largest ( absolute ) observation is a classical statistic : @xmath33 @xmath11 is useful in non - gaussianity detection because @xmath34 when @xmath15 are truly from @xmath25 ; thus a significant difference between @xmath35 and @xmath36 implies non - gaussianity .",
    "the aim of this section is to establish a simple theoretical comparison between the three statistics applied in this paper .",
    "we show the power of the different statistical tests in detecting the distortion generated by a faint non - gaussian signal ( modeled as a function of the decaying rate of the tail of the distribution ) superposed on a gaussian signal .",
    "similar to the analysis presented in jin et al .",
    "2004 , the superposed image can be thought of as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the observed image , @xmath39 is the non - gaussian component , and @xmath40 is the gaussian component ( assumed to have mean zero and dispersion one , @xmath25 ) .",
    "we study the power of the three statistics in testing whether @xmath41 or not .",
    "one can do such a test either in real space ( the space of the observations ) or , as it is done in this paper , in wavelet space . for sufficiently fine resolution",
    ", the wavelet coefficients @xmath15 of @xmath38 can be modeled as : @xmath42 where @xmath1 is the number of observations , @xmath43 is a parameter , @xmath44 are the transform coefficients of the gaussian component @xmath40 , and @xmath45 are the transform coefficients of the non - gaussian component @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath46 is some unknown distribution with vanishing first and third order moment ( this constraint is only imposed to simplify the possible range of non - gaussian distributions , and it will be representative of a gaussian distribution modified by a few large values contributing to a tail ) . without loss of generality , we assume the standard deviation of both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are @xmath49 . phrased in statistical terms , the problem of detecting the existence of a non - gaussian component is equivalent to discriminating between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 being equivalent to @xmath53 .    in order to obtain a quantitative estimation of the ability of the three statistics to detect the non - gaussian component , we parametrize the tail probability of @xmath46 as follows .",
    "@xmath54 to model increasingly challenging situations as the number of observations increases , we calibrate @xmath55 to decay with @xmath1 as : @xmath56 to constrain the detectability of such a non - gaussian distribution superposed to a gaussian one , we search the @xmath57 and @xmath12 parameter space .",
    "we define the regions of this space that will be detectable under different statistical tests .",
    "it was shown in jin et al .",
    "2004 that there is a curve in the @xmath57-@xmath12 plane that separates the detectable regions of parameters from the undetectable regions .",
    "that curve is given by : @xmath58 in figure 1 , we compare the results of @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "when it is possible to detect , @xmath9 or @xmath11 are better than @xmath10 when @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath10 is better than @xmath9 or @xmath11 when @xmath60 .    to conclude this section",
    ", we remark that the performance of @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 depends on different situations of non - gaussianity .",
    "intuitively , @xmath11 is designed to capture evidence of unusual behavior of the most extreme observations against the gaussian assumption .",
    "the @xmath9 statistic is able to capture unusual behavior of the most extreme observations , as well as unusually large amounts of moderately high observations . thus @xmath9 is better than @xmath11 , in general",
    "however , when the evidence against the gaussian assumption truly lies in the most extreme observations , @xmath9 and @xmath11 are almost equivalent .",
    "in contrast , @xmath10 is designed to capture the evidence hidden in the 4th moment .",
    "therefore this statistic depends on the bulk of the data , rather than on a few extreme observations or a small fraction of relatively large observations .",
    "lastly , the @xmath9 statistic offers an automatic way to find the area of the data accounting for the non - gaussianity , while the @xmath11 and @xmath10 statistics do not have this capability .",
    "the data collected by the wmap satellite during the first year of operation is available at the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) website . following komatsu et al .",
    "2003 , the analysis presented in this work is based on a data set obtained by the weighted combination of the released foreground cleaned intensity maps at bands q , v and w. each of these maps can be downloaded in the healpix nested format at resolution @xmath61 ( total number of pixels being @xmath62 ) .",
    "the co - added map is obtained by the following combination @xmath63 the temperature at pixel @xmath27 , @xmath64 results from the ratio of the weighted sum of temperatures at pixel @xmath27 at each radiometer divided by the sum of the weights of each radiometer at pixel @xmath27 . the radiometers q1 , q2 , v1 , v2 , w1 , w2 , w3 and w4",
    "are sequentially numbered from 3 to 10 .",
    "the weights at each pixel , for each radiometer @xmath65 , are the ratio of the number of observations @xmath66 divided by the square of the receiver noise dispersion @xmath67.this results in a co - added map at resolution @xmath61 .",
    "this map is downgraded to resolution @xmath68 before the analyses are performed . in order to remove galactic and point source emission , we applied the most conservative mask provided by the wmap team , the kp0 mask .",
    "this follows the procedure first presented by vielva et al .",
    "2004 .    in order to detect any possible deviations from the predictions of the standard inflationary model we compared the values of several statistics in the wmap data set described above , with those obtained from 5000 monte carlo simulations .",
    "the temperature at a certain pixel @xmath27 ( pointing towards a direction characterized by polar angles @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , can be expressed as an expansion in spherical harmonics @xmath71 @xmath72 the monte carlo simulations were performed assuming a gaussian distribution @xmath73 for the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath74 where @xmath75 represents the power spectrum that best fits the wmap , cbi and acbar cmb data , plus the 2df and lyman - alpha data .",
    "beam transfer functions as well as number of observations and receiver noise dispersion were taken into account when simulating data taken by each of the receivers ( all of these , as well as the best fit power spectrum are provided by the wmap team in the lambda website ) .    the analysis was carried out in both real space and wavelet space .",
    "we convolved the wmap data set and the monte carlo simulations with the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) at fifteen scales , following the same procedure presented in vielva et al .",
    "2004 and cruz et al . 2005 .",
    "the scales , numbered from 1 to 15 , correspond to @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 arcmin . in order to avoid border effects caused by the mask included in the wmap data set and the simulations ,",
    "analyses are performed outside extended masks defined at each scale . given a scale , the extended mask is the kp0 mask plus pixels near the galactic plane that are within @xmath91 times the scale .",
    "all of these extended masks were presented in figure 2 of vielva et al .",
    "as discussed in the next section , deviations are detected in wavelet space .",
    "this shows once again the value of wavelets to provide a space in which certain features that might be causing deviations from the predictions of the standard inflationary model are enhanced .",
    "based on 5,000 simulations , we calculated the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath2 confidence regions for each of the 4 statistics ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and the two hc tests ) at each of the 15 wavelet scales used .",
    "we used two - sided confidence regions for @xmath10 , as it is symmetric about 0 under the null hypothesis that the data is gaussian . @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath9 statistics are defined so that the larger the statistic , the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis . therefore , we used one - sided confidence regions for these statistics .",

    "the wmap data appears outside the @xmath2 confidence level obtained based on the predictions of the standard inflationary model at scale 9 ( 300 arcmin ) for these three tests . in particular",
    ", @xmath95 of the 5000 simulations have @xmath11 and @xmath96 values below the one obtained from the wmap data set . therefore in this particular case",
    "these statistics are as competitive as the kurtosis in detecting deviations from the assumed null hypothesis .",
    "as discussed above , the @xmath9 statistical tests introduced in this paper are able to detect deviations from the standard inflationary model in the wmap data at scales around 300 arcmin . moreover , the power of this new test resides in providing a direct way to determine which pixels in the wmap data set are generating these deviations . by comparing the values of the @xmath9 test at each pixel , with the value that defines the @xmath2 confidence limit at scale 9 , we were able to extract a total of @xmath97 pixels that are causing the detected deviation .",
    "figure 5 shows the individual pixel values of the @xmath9 statistic for the wmap data set at scale 9 .",
    "the selected pixels above the @xmath2 limit are plotted in the map shown in figure 6 .",
    "as can be seen , these pixels define a ring centered at position @xmath98 .",
    "it is important to note that the correlations introduced by the convolution with the wavelet need to be taken into account in order to properly interpret this result .",
    "some pixels within the ring could also initially ( in the map in real space ) deviate from gaussianity .",
    "removal of the pixels in the ring from the analysed wmap data resulted in a set of data compatible with the predictions from the standard inflationary model ( see figure 7 ) .",

    "the analysis is based on the recently developed @xmath9 statistic .",
    "this statistic is especially sensitive to two types of deviations from gaussianity : an unusually large amount of moderately significant values or a small fraction of unusually extreme values . in both of these cases",
    "the hc statistic is optimal ( donoho & jin 2004 , jin et al .",
    "moreover , the definition of the statistic naturally suggests a direct way to locate the possible sources of non - gaussianity . even if the wavelet transform is a linear process ,",

    "the three statistics provided comparable results , pointing to the presence of deviations at a wavelet scale of @xmath6 degrees .",
    "we made use of the @xmath9 statistic to automatically identify the pixels in the wmap data set that were causing such deviations .",

    "removal of this set of pixels from the wmap data made the data compatible with the predictions from the standard inflationary model .",
    "one should be cautious when interpreting this result .",
    "the detection is achieved in wavelet space .",
    "even if only the pixels in the ring appear as outliers of the hc distribution at wavelet scale of 5 degrees , some other pixels whithin the ring could be involved in the observed deviation .",
    "convolution with the wavelet introduces correlations between pixels that need to be properly taken into account in the definition of the statistic to allow a correct interpretation .",
