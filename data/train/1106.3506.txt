    "in this note we present the technical derivations of the results in the letter `` population genetics in compressible flows '' ( `` main text '' ) .",
    "first , we describes the derivation of the macroscopic equations for the particle model introduced in the main text .",
    "then , we describe details of the continuum simulations and of the shell model of turbulence .",
    "finally , we discuss the relation between the model introduced in the main text and the simpler stochastic fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piskounov ( fkpp ) equation ( eq . ( 1 ) of the main text ) .",

    "the birth and death processes are characterized by the following transition rates :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the probability per unit time of population @xmath11 to increase its size by one unit when the total populations are @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and similarly for @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    there",
    "exist several methods to derive macroscopic equations for particle models @xcite , most popular being the van kampen system size expansion and the kramers - moyal expansion . while the former is more rigorous when studying problems beyond the linear noise approximation , the latter is normally used because it leads to more transparent expressions .",
    "moreover , it can be shown ( see e.g. @xcite , page 251 ) that at the order of the fokker planck equation the two methods are completely equivalent .",
    "the kramers - moyal method works as follows : consider a master equation , and call @xmath99 the transition rate from @xmath100 particles to @xmath101 particles .",
    "when @xmath100 is typically large and @xmath102 relatively small ( @xmath103 in the case of birth - death process considered here ) a taylor series expansion of the master equation in @xmath102 for the probability @xmath104 of having @xmath100 particles at time @xmath46 is appropriate : @xmath105\\ ] ] with @xmath106 truncating the taylor expansion at the second order in @xmath107 leads to a fokker - planck equation .",

    "if @xmath18 is not large , the noise can not be approximated by a gaussian noise .",
    "the model is generalized to include advection and diffusion in space as follows : particles belonging to the two species advect and diffuse in space in a lagrangian way , i.e. the position @xmath66 of a given particle evolves according to : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a unit amplitude brownian noise source that implements diffusion with diffusion constant @xmath3 . at each time step @xmath121 , a given particle duplicates with probability @xmath122 or annihilates due to competition with rate @xmath123 , where @xmath124 are now the number of particles of type @xmath125 in a region of size @xmath32 centered in the particle itself .",
    "the macroscopic equations in the spatial case can be derived using arguments similar to the well mixed case .",
    "we assume that binary reactions can occur only when both particles are within a length @xmath32 , and also take this as the size of our discretization volume .",
    "although the total particle number in this region fluctuates , @xmath32 plays a role similar to an island spacing in a stepping stone model .",

    "one is left with a discretized set of well defined langevin equations , a natural generalization of the discrete stepping stone model with dimensionless species concentrations . the first procedure , after setting as before @xmath137 , results in : @xmath138 which is a set of well defined stochastic differential equations , valid for a particular lattice spacing @xmath32 .    the second procedure , however , leads to a more convenient passage to the continuum limit ,    @xmath139 + \\mathrm{diffusion / advection }    + \\sqrt{\\frac{c_a^i[\\mu+\\tilde{\\mu}n\\delta(c_a^i+c_b^i)]}{n\\delta}}\\xi^i_a    \\nonumber\\\\    \\frac{dc_b^i}{dt}&=&c_b^i[\\mu-\\tilde{\\mu}n\\delta(c_a^i - c_b^i ) ] + \\mathrm { diffusion / advection }    + \\sqrt{\\frac{c_b^i[\\mu+\\tilde{\\mu}n\\delta(c_a^i+c_b^i)]}{n\\delta}}\\xi^i_b\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    starting with eq.([spdiscr ] ) , a formal way to achieve the continuous limit is to set first @xmath140 by rescaling the densities .",

    "@xcite , page 314 ) .",
    "one reason is that advection and diffusion terms can contribute significantly to the variance of the noise when the cells are small ( @xcite , page 313 ) ; these terms can be neglected only if the equations will be discretized on a sufficiently coarse lattice . moreover ,",

    "in addition to particle simulations , eq.s ( [ model1]-[model2 ] ) ( i.e. eqs . ( 2 ) in the main text ) have been simulated numerically by using finite difference methods in space and the euler - cauchy method for time steps with a variety of velocity fields @xmath26 .",

    "<S> hereafter , we fix the following parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath38 and @xmath42 where @xmath30 is the one dimensional domain endowed with periodic boundary conditions . with these parameters , @xmath9 would be @xmath43 for the one dimensional fkkp equation , and @xmath44 for the well - mixed case .    introducing a compressible velocity field @xmath26 , as shown in fig.([fig1]b ) , leads to radically different dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> individuals tend to concentrate at sinks in the velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> further , competition is enhanced and the total number of individuals @xmath45 present at time @xmath46 is on average significantly smaller than the total carrying capacity @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we implemented three different velocity fields : 1 ) a velocity field @xmath26 generated by a shell model of compressible turbulence @xcite , reproducing the power spectrum of a high reynolds number turbulent velocity field of forcing intensity @xmath47 @xcite , 2 ) a static sine wave , @xmath48 , and 3 ) a linear velocity profile , @xmath49 , confining particles near the origin . </S>",
    "<S> periodic boundary conditions on the unit interval are used in cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , while in case ( 3 ) the system size is so large that particles never reach the boundaries .     for neutral competition in compressible turbulence and sine wave advection , as a function of ( left ) the reduced carrying capacity @xmath50 and ( right ) forcing intensity @xmath47 ( smaller @xmath50 in the left panel corresponds to larger forcing in the right panel ) . in ( a ) red circles and blue triangles </S>",
    "<S> are particle simulations . </S>",
    "<S> other symbols denote simulations of the continuum equations with different resolutions on the unit interval . </S>",
    "<S> the black dashed line is the mean field prediction , @xmath51 . in ( b ) , only particle simulations are shown and dashed lines are the theoretical prediction @xmath52 based on boundary domains , with fitted parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 in the case of the shell model and @xmath55 , @xmath56 in the case of the sine wave.[fig2],width=317 ]    fig.([fig2 ] ) shows the average fixation time @xmath9 for @xmath22 in the first two cases , at varying the intensity @xmath47 of advection . in the left panel , </S>",
    "<S> we plot the fixation times as a function of the time averaged reduced carrying capacity @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the carrying capacity reduction , i.e. the ratio between the actual number of particles and the average number of particles @xmath18 observed in absence of the velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> plotting vs. @xmath59 allows comparisons with the mean field prediction , @xmath60 , valid for well mixed systems ( black dashed line ) @xcite . for the shell model , </S>",
    "<S> we include simulations of the macroscopic equations ( [ model ] ) with different resolutions ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 lattice sites on the unit interval ) , obtaining always similar results for @xmath9 vs. @xmath59 .    in all cases </S>",
    "<S> , the presence of a spatially varying velocity field leads to a dramatic reduction of @xmath9 , compared to the mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the fixation time drops abruptly as soon as @xmath63 , even for very small @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> simulations suggest a singular limit of zero intensity ( @xmath64 ) of the velocity field ( and consequently @xmath65 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , as we discuss later .    </S>",
    "<S> these observations can be understood by assuming that global fixation is determined by coalescence of allele boundaries like those shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig1]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> although in the stochastic fkpp with @xmath22 the boundaries perform a random walk @xcite , here they are also advected by the velocity field . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the average position of one boundary @xmath66 , neglecting diffusion and number fluctuations , will simply evolve according @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the fixation time is then determined by the time needed for the boundaries to reach the center of a sink and annihilate . because periodic boundary conditions are imposed , the number of interfaces is necessarily even , so all of them annihilate pairwise . upon expanding the velocity field around a sink position @xmath68 , @xmath69 , we find a fixation time @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we model the average time to fixation @xmath9 vs. the velocity field intensity as @xmath9=@xmath71 , where @xmath72 represents the typical time to reach fixation at large strain rate @xmath73 and @xmath74 is an dimensionless constant of order unity . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenological theory describes well the data of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , right panel ( dot - dashed lines ) , where in the turbulent case we take the forcing @xmath47 as a proxy for @xmath73 ( @xmath75 for the sine wave and @xmath76 for turbulence ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now study particles subject to a converging linear velocity , @xmath49 . when @xmath73 is large ( and @xmath77 is small ) , the fixation time is comparable to the mean field prediction . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the forcing decreases , it becomes much _ </S>",
    "<S> larger _ than the mean field prediction ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a , dashed line ) . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> the fixation time probability distribution is bimodal ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a , inset ) : roughly half of the realizations have a short fixation time ( faster than mean field ) , while the other half maintain coexistence for an extended period . the space - time evolution of these configurations in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b reveals that the two mutant species are _ demixed _ , one on the left and one on the right of the sink . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the average total heterozigosity @xmath78 , defined as the probability of two random individuals to be of different type @xcite , decays exponentially for very large @xmath73 ( consistent with mean field theory @xcite ) , but tends to a constant , non - zero value when smaller values of @xmath73 are chosen ( fig [ fig3]c ) .     </S>",
    "<S> in the presence of a linear converging flow @xmath79 , as a function of the reduced carrying capacity @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> inset on left shows the distribution of fixation times in the case @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the right peak representing all realizations with fixation times @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) space - time plot of a realization with a very long fixation time . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) average heterozigosity as a function of time for different values of @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3],width=317 ]    this remarkable behavior arises because of the different boundary conditions for the linear sink , such that the number of domain boundaries is no longer always even . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the initial number of boundaries will be odd approximately half the time for random initial conditions , leading to the single surviving boundary as shown on the right of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration corresponds to a stable stationary solution of the deterministic version of eqs [ model ] with @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this demixed solution , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 nonzero on opposite sides of the sink , should have a lifetime ( inaccessible in numerical simulations ) which grows exponentially with @xmath18 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> , ( left ) species are neutral as in fig . 3 , ( right ) red reproduces 30% faster . </S>",
    "<S> notice the shift in the position of the boundary.[fig4],width=317 ]    finally , what happens for a selective advantage @xmath23 ? </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] shows a comparison between the neutral case of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] and a simulation in which red particles reproduce @xmath86 faster ( @xmath87 ) . </S>",
    "<S> even with such a large selective advantage , genetic interfaces are still present . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the shift in the interface as @xmath88 , by equating the outward fisher genetic wave velocity @xmath89 @xcite with the inward advection velocity at distance @xmath90 from the origin .    to conclude , we have introduced a new model which allows studies of how compressible advection affects darwinian competition . </S>",
    "<S> a compressible flow leads to a radically new scenario , with the fixation time being largely determined by how species boundaries collapse into the sinks of the velocity field , rather than by diffusive annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> our phenomenological theory suggests a significative effect even for very weak compressible fields . </S>",
    "<S> compressible advection becomes irrelevant for the fixation time only when the time to drift into the sinks ( of order @xmath91 ) is much larger than the diffusion time ( of order @xmath92 , where @xmath30 is a typical linear size of the population ) . </S>",
    "<S> an obvious application of the model is the study of compressible flows in higher space dimensions , including flows relevant to biological oceanography of photosynthetic organisms near the water surface . </S>",
    "<S> recent advances in experimental techniques could also lead to tests of the one dimensional results . </S>",
    "<S> motility of bacteria has been studied in microstructures of diameter comparable or even smaller to that of the organisms @xcite . in this </S>",
    "<S> setting , a compressible flow could be created by pumping liquid nutrient from the two ends of the tube and extracting it from the center via a semipermeable membrane . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility could be to study floating microorganisms @xcite and make use of the compressible effects caused by the vertical component of a convecting velocity field @xcite .    </S>",
