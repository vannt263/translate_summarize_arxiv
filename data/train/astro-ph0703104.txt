    "the formation of massive stars is currently one of the key questions in stellar astrophysics .",
    "various scenarios have been proposed ; accretion from a circumstellar envelope ( e.g.  shu et al .",
    "@xcite , behrend & maeder @xcite ) , accretion from a turbulent molecular core ( mckee & tan @xcite ) or a mixture of competitive accretion and collisions of lower mass protostars in the core of dense stellar clusters ( e.g.  bonnell et al .",
    "@xcite , bonnell & bate @xcite ) being the most popular ones .",
    "since the bulk of the massive stars are found in open clusters , some clues on this question can probably be obtained from a study of the star formation processes within young open clusters . beside their massive star population ,",
    "such clusters usually harbour a wealth of lower mass objects with the least massive ones that have not yet reached the zero age main sequence .",
    "an important issue is the relationship between the high - mass cluster members and these low - mass objects . while it has sometimes been suggested that the massive stars trigger the formation of the lower mass objects , in several cases , the lower mass pre - main sequence stars are found to be significantly older than the massive cluster members ( e.g.  damiani et al .",
    "@xcite , prisinzano et al .",
    "herbig ( @xcite ) accordingly suggested that the formation of early - type stars could stop the formation process of lower mass stars in a cluster by dispersing the ambient gas .",
    "other authors ( e.g.  sung et al .",
    "@xcite ) however suggested that the observed age discrepancy might result from the fact that the pms evolutionary tracks actually overestimate the _ real _ age of the protostars .",
    "obviously , investigating the properties of lower mass pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars in very young open clusters can help us to understand the feedback of massive stars on their environment and can thereby shed light on the way the most massive objects have formed .",
    "classical ttauri pms stars display emission in the balmer lines and can thus be identified through photometric observations with an h@xmath3 narrow band filter .",
    "most classical ttauri stars ( ctts ) also display near - infrared excesses that are attributed to heated dust in a disk - like accretion structure ( e.g.  meyer et al .",
    "however , another category of pms objects , the so - called weak - line ttauri stars ( wtts ) , display only weak optical line emission and do not show significant near - ir excesses . an interesting property that can help us to identify these pms stars",
    "is their relatively strong x - ray emission with @xmath1 reaching values as large as @xmath4 ( e.g.  neuhuser @xcite , feigelson & montmerle @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations can therefore enable the selection of pms stars , such as wtts , that would neither be detected through h@xmath3 nor through near - ir photometry ( e.g.  damiani et al .",
    "the high sensitivity of _ xmm - newton _ and the exceptional spatial resolution of _ chandra _ have already been used to study some rich young open clusters in the x - ray domain .",
    "for instance , ngc6530 at the core of the lagoon nebula was found to harbour both classical and weak - line ttauri stars with masses between 0.5 and 2.0m@xmath0 , but only a few of the x - ray selected pms candidates were found to be ctts ( rauw et al .",

    "] ngc6383 , on the other hand , does not contain any known ctts , but our _ xmm - newton _ observations revealed a number of weak x - ray sources in this cluster that are most likely associated with wtts ( rauw et al .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the optical properties of these sources suggested that they are in fact older than the massive binary hd159176 ( o7v + o7v ) in the centre of the cluster .",
    "ngc6231 - at the core of the scoob1 association - is another very young open cluster , rich in massive o - type stars . using @xmath5 photometry , sung et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter sbl98 ) inferred a mean cluster reddening of @xmath6 and a distance modulus of @xmath7 .",
    "these authors noted that the reddening law towards ngc6231 could be somewhat peculiar with @xmath8 .",
    "sbl98 found only 12 pms objects ( and 7 pms candidates ) brighter than @xmath9 displaying h@xmath3 emission .",
    "however , as pointed out above , there could be a number of pms stars without h@xmath3 emission ; but with optical photometry only , these would be very difficult to distinguish from field stars lying to the right of the cluster main - sequence . in this paper",
    ", we use the catalogue of _ xmm - newton _ sources in ngc6231 presented by sana et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) to investigate the properties of x - ray sources with faint optical counterparts in this cluster .",
    "the x - ray properties of the early - type stars in ngc6231 were discussed in a separate paper ( sana et al .",
    "@xcite , paper  ii ) .",
    "adopting a 3  correlation radius , 446 of the x - ray sources in the ngc6231 field have an optical counterpart in the catalogue of sung et al .",
    "( @xcite ) extended down to @xmath10 ( sung h. , unpublished ) .",
    "we note that our combined epic field of view extends over a wider area than the actual field investigated by sbl98 and some sources outside the sbl98 area actually have counterparts in other optical / near - ir catalogues ( see paper  i ) .",
    "nevertheless , throughout this paper , we will restrict ourselves to the sources with counterparts in the extended sbl98 catalogue .",
    "the reasons are , on the one hand , that the usno and gsc photometries are less accurate than the results of sbl98 . on the other hand , the new photometry acquired by one of us ( h.  sung ) over a larger field than initially investigated by sbl98 ( referred to as ssb06 in paper  i ) does not include observations with the h@xmath3 filter .",
    "the @xmath11 vs.  @xmath12 and @xmath11 vs.  @xmath13 colour - magnitude diagrams of the optical counterparts are shown in fig.[coulmag ] . the bulk of the objects are found to be rather faint stars mostly located to the right of the main - sequence . at @xmath14 ,",
    "the photometric error on most colour indices reaches about 0.1  mag .",
    "errors on the @xmath15 index tend however to be larger ( fig .",
    "[ coulmag ] , upper panel ) because of the lower quality of the @xmath16 photometry in sbl98 .",

    "have been observed in the @xmath11 , @xmath19 and h@xmath3 bands .",
    "this allowed the authors to compute a pseudo continuum ( labelled @xmath20 ) near h@xmath3 , as the mean of the @xmath11 and @xmath19 magnitudes . to identify h@xmath3 emitting stars among these x - ray selected objects",
    ", one can then compare the @xmath18 index to its value for main sequence stars .",
    "for the latter , we use the relation between the @xmath18 and @xmath13 indices for main sequence stars proposed by sung et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and we account for the effect of cluster reddening on the @xmath13 colour index ( see below ) . following sung et al .",

    "19 objects of our sample have @xmath23 and one has @xmath24 .",

    ", we find that about 18% ( 70 out of 392 ) of the x - ray selected objects are either confirmed or potential h@xmath3 emission objects .",
    "this large number of h@xmath3 emission candidates compared to the original results of sbl98 is mainly due to the fact that the photometry used here extends down to much fainter magnitudes ( fig.[ha ] , lower panel ) .",
    "a total of 384 epic sources in the field of view of ngc6231 have also a counterpart in the two micron all sky survey point source catalogue ( 2mass , cutri et al .",
    "@xcite ) . among these ,",
    "333 sources have also a counterpart in the sbl98 catalogue .",
    "we used the march 2003 update of the colour transformations , initially derived by carpenter ( @xcite ) and available on the 2mass website , to convert the @xmath26 and @xmath27 colour indices to the homogenized @xmath28 photometric system introduced by bessell & brett ( @xcite ) . assuming that the 2mass and sbl98 magnitudes are not affected by photometric variability",
    ", we tried to establish the effective temperature and bolometric correction using a dereddened @xmath29 colour index . comparing the results with those obtained from the @xmath13 index ( see below ) ,",
    "we find that , for the large majority of the stars , the former technique yields systematically lower temperatures ( sometimes by more than 1000k ) than the latter one . for objects surrounded by circumstellar material , such a discrepancy could reflect the presence of a near - ir excess ( that would mimic a lower temperature in the @xmath29 colour index ) .",
    "however , for the bulk of the objects , the most likely explanation for this effect is probably the rather large errors in the 2mass magnitudes .",
    "note also that the reddening correction over such a wide wavelength range , using the extinction law of rieke & lebofsky ( @xcite ) , might simply not be adequate for stars in ngc6231 ( perhaps as a result of the peculiarities of the extinction law discussed by sung et al .",
    "in addition , the 2mass colour indices and magnitudes of some objects are either subject to large uncertainties or are only upper limits due to non - detections . in total",
    ", we find that only 295 out of the 384 2mass counterparts have quality flags a , b , c or d for the measurements of all three individual near - ir magnitudes . restricting the @xmath28 colour - colour diagram to these objects",
    ", we find that their location is consistent with slightly reddened main - sequence or giant stars ( see fig.[2mass ] ) .",
    "only a couple of sources show evidence for a moderate ir excess and only about ten objects display strongly reddened ir colours .",
    "although a small fraction ( @xmath30% , see paper  i ) of the x - ray selected objects might in fact be field stars ( either foreground or background ) unrelated to ngc6231 , we have assumed that all stars are located at the distance of the cluster ( dm = @xmath31 , paper  i ) and are all subject to the same reddening ( @xmath32 , sung et al .",
    "we have then built the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) of these epic sources using effective temperatures and bolometric corrections interpolated from the dereddened @xmath13 colour indices for main sequence stars of spectral types b0 to m6 tabulated by kenyon & hartmann ( @xcite ) .",
    "eight sources ( a subset of those not covered by the @xcite sung et al .",

    "( @xcite ) for @xmath33 and without overshooting ( note that these evolutionary models include neither rotation nor accretion ) .",
    "errors on the effective temperatures and bolometric magnitudes were obtained by error propagation , including contributions from the photometric measurements , the cluster distance , and the average @xmath34 and @xmath35 color excesses obtained from sbl98 .",
    "note that the color degeneracy of the hotter stars ( i.e. the fact that a small range in color index corresponds to a large range of ) implies that the determination of their effective temperature becomes very sensitive to any uncertainty on the @xmath36 index .",
    "even when the observed @xmath37 data are excellent , the dereddening introduces a fix contribution to the error on @xmath36 , yielding uncertainties on the effective temperature of several thousands kelvin ( see fig .",
    "[ hrd ] ) . in the following ,",
    "the twelve stars with @xmath38  k will be ignored while computing the age distribution of the stars in ngc 6231 as they do not provide any constraint on the cluster age .",
    "we find that most of the x - ray selected , optically faint objects ( @xmath39 ) fall between the pms evolutionary tracks for stars of masses in the range 0.3 to 3.0m@xmath0 .",
    "a comparison with the isochrones further indicates that the majority of these objects should have ages ranging from 1 to 10myr ( see fig.[ages ] ) .",
    "we estimated the age of the 372 objects by linearly interpolating the isochrones ( computed between 0 and 20 myr with a step of 1myr ) along the  axis .",
    "the obtained distribution of ages peaks around @xmath40 1  4myr and decreases towards lower ages ( see fig .  [ ages ] ) .",
    "average and quartiles are given in table [ tab : qwart ] .",
    "the mean and 1-@xmath41 dispersion are strongly affected by the older age tail and does not represent neither the centroid nor the width of the peak seen in the histograms . within our uncertainties , no significant difference is found between the different distributions considered in table [ tab : qwart ] .",

    "( @xcite ) compared the h - r diagram of ngc6231 to pms tracks of bernasconi & maeder ( @xcite ) finding an age spread of about 11myr for the low mass objects . while this is similar to the age spread found here ,",

    ", we do not find a large age difference between those stars displaying h@xmath3 emission ( probable ctts ) and those without ( probable wtts ) .",

    "other sources ( such as # 467 ) show a slower flux increase than expected for typical flares .",
    "stelzer et al . ( @xcite ) suggested that such a shape could be explained by a rotational modulation of the x - ray emission produced by the flare .",
    "in such a configuration , the flare actually occurs on the hidden face of the star and then becomes slowly visible with the rotation of the object .",
    "it is however difficult to investigate more this possibility in the present case as the rotational periods of our objects are not known .",

    "this relation is valid for the initial decay phase during which the emission measure decay is roughly exponential and has been applied to flares in a variety of active stars ( e.g.  briggs & pye @xcite , giardino et al .",

    "most loops appear rather compact ( @xmath53 ) except perhaps for source # 467 .",
    "favata ( @xcite ) notes that while most flaring structures are indeed relatively compact , extremely slowly decaying flares have been detected in some young stellar objects ( with @xmath54ks ) which correspond to rather large loops ( @xmath55r@xmath0 ) .",
    "favata ( @xcite ) accordingly suggests that the magnetic structures that produce these large loops link the star to the circumstellar disk .",
    "we note that , although our dataset is not suited to clearly identify slowly decaying flares , the decay seen for source # 241 might be a candidate for such an event .",
    "unfortunately , the source could not be associated with an optical counterpart though a near - ir counterpart was found .",
    "hence , we can not exclude that # 241 is a background source .    in this context",

    "further evidence for circumstellar material around this source comes from its near - ir excess . from table[tbl-4 ] , it appears that # 467 is also the source with the largest loop half - length ( @xmath57 ) in our sample .      using the bolometric magnitudes derived above from the sbl98 photometry , and the vignetting and background corrected epic count rates determined by the source detection algorithm",

    ", we took the average of the available count rates of the pn , mos1 and mos2 instruments assuming a conversion factor 2 between the mos and pn count rates .",
    "next , we computed a flux / pn count rate conversion factor assuming that the sources have an absorbed optically thin thermal plasma spectrum with a temperature of 1kev and @xmath59@xmath60 ( bohlin et al .",
    "note that adopting a temperature of 2kev ( more typical of the spectra of the brightest sources ) would only slightly increase this conversion factor ( by 14% ) . finally , we converted the unabsorbed fluxes into luminosities , assuming that all sources are members of ngc6231 ( @xmath61 ) .",

    "this value increases from about @xmath63 for b0 stars ( the hottest objects plotted in this figure ) to almost @xmath64 for the lower mass objects .",
    "a similar trend was already observed in ngc6530 ( rauw et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    of course",
    "the results in fig.[lxlbol ] could be somewhat biased by the fact that some of the sources are detected only during their flaring activity .",
    "we have repeated the same procedure for the brighter sources discussed hereabove . in the bottom panel of fig.[lxlbol ] , we distinguish between the flaring and non flaring sources .",
    "we find that the average luminosity during a flare can reach up to @xmath65ergs@xmath66 ( source # 304 ) and @xmath1 can temporarily increase to values as large as @xmath67 ( source # 100 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the brighter steady sources also display rather large x - ray luminosities , up to @xmath68ergs@xmath66 , as well as large @xmath1 , up to @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that even non - flaring pms sources in ngc6231 can be rather x - ray bright .",
    "our _ xmm - newton _ campaign provides the deepest x - ray view ever of ngc6231 .",
    "while the x - ray images of the cluster are dominated by its high - mass members ( see paper  i ) , we detect a substantial number of sources that have faint optical counterparts .",
    "the typical spectra of these sources , their flaring behaviour , their x - ray luminosities as well as the location of their optical counterparts in the h - r diagram indicate that these sources form a population of pms stars .",
    "compared to previous optical investigations of the cluster ( sung et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the number of pms stars is increased by a factor 20 at least .",
    "an interesting feature is the age spread among the low - mass pms objects ( @xmath70myr ) that exceeds the main sequence lifetime of the massive o stars in the cluster .",
    "this feature was already noted by previous authors .",
    "raboud et al .",
    "( @xcite ) obtained photometry of ngc6231 in the geneva system .",
    "fitting isochrones to the main sequence and post - main sequence stars believed to be single , these authors derived an age between 3.2 and 4.5myr for the more massive stars , whilst they noted that the pms stars detected in their observations were mostly older than 3.2myr and had ages up to 10myr .",
    "a similar situation was found by sung et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who derived an age of 2.5  4myr for the massive stars in the cluster , while they found an age spread of 11myr in the pms objects .",
    "raboud et al .",
    "( @xcite ) accordingly suggested that there was a continuous low - mass star formation activity in ngc6231 at previous times , which came to an end about 3.2 ",
    "4.5myr ago when the massive o stars of the cluster formed during a nearly coeval burst . from our results ,",
    "the age distribution of x - ray selected low - mass stars peaks around 1  4myr , i.e.  at the time of the formation of the early - type cluster members .",
    "however , the formation of low mass stars in ngc6231 started already more than 10myr ago at a rather slow rate .",
    "the star formation rate subsequently increased , culminating in a starburst event during which most of the pms as well as the more massive objects formed .",
    "then , about 1myr ago , the formation of stars in ngc6231 came to an end rather abruptly .    in the case of ngc6530 , damiani et al .",
    "( @xcite ) report on a spatial age gradient , suggesting a sequence of star formation events . to check whether a similar situation holds for ngc6231",
    ", we have plotted the spatial distribution of x - ray selected pms stars of different ages in fig.[carte ] .",
    "it can be seen that , in the case of ngc6231 , there exists no clear separation between the different groups . while this could be a projection effect (",
    "if star formation were progressing along our line of sight towards the cluster ) , we nevertheless conclude that there is no evidence in our data for a spatial age gradient in ngc6231 .",
    "the star formation history of ngc6231 provides constraints on future modelling of massive star formation in open clusters .",
    "several properties of the ngc6231 cluster could be explained by a massive star formation scenario involving physical collisions in a dense cluster core ( bonnell et al .",
    "these features are the large binary fraction among the massive stars in this cluster , the spatial concentration of pms stars around the massive cluster members and last but not least , the age difference between the pms objects and the more massive stars . indeed , n - body simulations of compact cluster cores including the effects of stellar evolution and physical collisions ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "@xcite ) show that , because of mass segregation , physical collisions between stars are frequent in the cluster core .",
    "the resulting mergers could lead to the formation of very massive ( @xmath71m@xmath0 ) stars within 3  4myr .",
    "the stars are rejuvenated by each new collision , therefore considerably extending their lifetime .",
    "the products of such a process would thus appear as some sort of ` blue stragglers ' in the h - r diagram of the cluster .",
    "alternatively , a moderate age difference could also result if massive star formation proceeds through accretion as proposed by norberg & maeder ( @xcite ) and behrend & maeder ( @xcite ) .",
    "these authors assumed that the pms objects accrete a constant fraction of the observed outflow rates , which in turn increases with the stellar luminosity and hence the stellar mass . in their models ,",
    "the stars become visible on the birthline once a significant part of the surrounding cocoon has been dispersed . for instance , in the models of norberg & maeder ( @xcite ) , an accreting protostar that will eventually form a 120m@xmath0 star would spent half of the accretion time below a mass of about 2m@xmath0 .",
    "the time needed for an accreting protostar to increase its mass from 2 to 120m@xmath0 would then be about 1myr .",
    "these models require rather high accretion rates ( of order @xmath72m@xmath0yr@xmath66 to form an 85m@xmath0 star , behrend & maeder @xcite ) .",
    "though this value seems high , it is apparently not forbidden by the results of wolfire & cassinelli ( @xcite ) .",
    "the models of behrend & maeder ( @xcite ) accordingly predict that low mass stars form first and high mass stars form slightly later .",
    "however , the duration for the formation of an 80m@xmath0 star is only about 10% larger than that of an 8m@xmath0 star .",
    "henceforth , this scenario alone can not explain the large age spread observed in fig.[ages ] .",
    "in this third paper of the series , we discussed the properties of the ngc  6231 x - ray sources with faint optical counterparts .",
    "their typical x - ray spectra and luminosities , their flaring behaviour as well as their location in the h - r diagram indicate that the bulk of these objects are most probably pms stars with masses between 0.3 and 3.0  m@xmath0 .",
    "their observed age distribution suggests that the low - mass stars in ngc 6231 started their formation at a relatively slow rate over 10  myr ago .",
    "this process then culminated 1 to 4 myr ago in a starburst - like event that coincided with the time of formation of the massive stars in the cluster .",
    "no difference in the location of the ctts and wtts in the cluster as well as no spatial age gradient were observed .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the brightest pms sources are well reproduced by rather hard thermal plasma models .",
    "about one third of them displays flaring activity during the _ xmm - newton _ campaign .",
    "the observed @xmath1 values increase with decreasing bolometric luminosity up to values of @xmath2 for non - flaring sources and to even larger values during flares .",
    "finally , we qualitatively discussed possible implications for the massive star formation in ngc 6231 . briefly a scenario implying the merging of low - mass objects to create high - mass stars would probably allow to explain most of the observational properties of the cluster .",
    "in particular , it will likely be able to reproduce the large binary fraction seen in the massive star population as well as the important time ( several myr ) separating the beginning of formation of the low- and high - mass stars .    to conclude",

    "<S> we discuss the properties of the x - ray sources with faint optical counterparts in the very young open cluster ngc6231 . from their positions in the h - r diagram , we find that the bulk of these objects probably consists of low - mass pre - main sequence stars with masses in the range 0.3 to 3.0m@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the age distribution of these objects indicates that low - mass star formation in ngc6231 started more than 10myr ago and culminated in a starburst - like event about 1 to 4myr ago when the bulk of the low - mass pms stars as well as the massive cluster members formed . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for a spatial age gradient that could point towards a sequential star formation process . </S>",
    "<S> only a few x - ray sources have counterparts with a reddening exceeding the average value of the cluster or with infrared colours indicating the presence of a moderate near - ir excess . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectra of the brightest pms sources are best fitted by rather hard thermal plasma models and a significant fraction of these sources display flares in their light curve . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray brightest flaring sources have decay times between 2 and 16ks . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray selected pms stars in ngc6231 have @xmath1 values that increase strongly with decreasing bolometric luminosity and can reach a saturation level ( @xmath2 ) for non - flaring sources and even more extreme values during flares .    </S>",
