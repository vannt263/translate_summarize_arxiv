    "genetic drift is a generic term for fluctuations in allele frequencies that arise by sampling a finite population to produce offspring in the next generation . in the absence of mutation",
    ", these fluctuations can lead to extinction of some alleles , ultimately causing one allele to fix .",
    "one can therefore ask whether it is feasible for some trait to propagate across an entire population by neutral genetic drift alone . in the simplest mathematical models , such as those due to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , individuals from the entire population mate randomly and it is known that fixation time ( measured in units of the expected lifetime of one individual in the population ) increases linearly with the population size @xcite .",
    "this growth law calls into question the viability of neutral genetic drift as a mechanism for population - level change , on the grounds that changes in large populations are simply far too slow .",
    "an important question then arising is whether _ non - random _ mating  for example , that seen in subdivided populations",
    " can reduce fixation times in large populations .",
    "this very same question has recently arisen in the context of the cultural evolutionary phenomenon of language change , in which the unit of variation is some aspect of spoken language , such as a vowel sound , through which one can distinguish different dialects of the same language , but which are otherwise functionally equivalent .",
    "a simple , agent - based model of language reception and reproduction @xcite , has a mathematical description that coincides with that of neutral genetic drift in a subdivided population , although a number of details of the underlying evolutionary processes are rather different  in particular , the language does not evolve due to genetic changes in the speakers , but rather the frequencies of linguistic variants in the population of utterances change over time in a manner akin to genetic drift .",
    "the key points here , however , are that fixation of an allele corresponds to a linguistic innovation being adopted as a community s convention , and that interactions between speakers map to migrations between large subpopulations .",
    "thus here even a linear growth in fixation time with the number of speakers ( each one corresponding to a single subpopulation ) is untenable : a change that becomes established in a small clique in a few days would then require several hundred years to propagate across a modestly - sized society . to see why this is a problem , one should note that this long timescale roughly corresponds with the age of language itself @xcite , whilst society - wide language change has been seen to occur within one or two human generations , for example in the case of new dialect formation @xcite .",
    "it is therefore tempting to suggest that some form of selection , i.e. , intrinsic fitness of some linguistic variants over others , is required for an innovation to spread rapidly across an entire society . to be able to state this categorically , however",
    ", we must understand quantitatively how fixation times and probabilities depend on the network of interactions between speakers in the society ( which , in the biological interpretation of our model , corresponds to a set of migration rates between geographically separated subpopulations ) and the overall size of that network ( the number of subpopulations ) .",
    "we also need to explore how these fixation statistics vary with changes in the initial condition ( distribution of mutants across the total population ) since this is the information provided in the historical data that we hope to use to infer the propagation mechanisms of linguistic innovations . in this work",
    ", we aim to develop this required understanding .    a recurring theme in the considerable literature on genetic drift in subdivided populations ",
    "this beginning with @xcite and continuing through to the present day ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews)is that properties of fixation are not strongly affected by such subdivision . for example , when migration is conservative , the probability a mutant allele fixes , whether selectively advantageous or not , is the same as that as in an ideal panmictic population with the same overall size @xcite .",
    "in particular this means that no matter where mutants are initially positioned , they fix with equal probability . for this state of affairs to change ,",
    "one either has either has to introduce additional processes  such as extinction and recolonisation @xcite  or relax the assumption of conservative migration @xcite in which case certain geographical structures can result in an allele with even a small selective advantage fixing with near certainty .",
    "whilst the dependence of fixation probability on the initial mutant distribution can be established rather easily ( see below ) , the corresponding variation of fixation time seems harder to obtain and progress in this direction forms the bulk of the present work .",
    "a continued study of the literature reveals that the concept of effective population size  which again goes back to @xcite  has proved useful in characterising the overall fixation timescale .",
    "essentially , the idea is that many properties of neutral genetic drift in a subdivided population comprising in total @xmath0 instances of a gene is twice the number of organisms .",
    "since ploidy is irrelevant in the cultural evolutionary application , we shall suppress these factors of two .",
    "] are the same as those for an ideal panmictic population with an effective number of gene instances @xmath1 .",
    "one prominent definition of effective population size relates to the change per generation in the variance of a mutant allele frequency @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be the frequency of mutants present in a population at some time , and @xmath3 their frequency after a single generation .",
    "then , the variance effective size can be defined as @xmath4 .",
    "if this effective population size is large , one can then use a diffusion approximation to model the evolution of the distribution of mutant frequencies .",
    "one can then calculate the mean time to fixation to be @xmath5 as was shown in the classic work by @xcite .",
    "thus if one has the variance effective population size for the kind of large , subdivided population that is of interest in the present work , eq .",
    "( [ tideal ] ) can be used to estimate the fixation time . in principle",
    "such an effective population size could be extracted from the diffusion approximation that applies to genetic drift in a subdivided population .",
    "however , one typically finds that the effective size depends on the mutant allele frequency @xmath2 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which makes the resulting expressions difficult to handle , unless additional approximations are made such as that used by @xcite . instead",
    ", we exploit here the fact that equilibrium values of genetic variables , such as the frequency of mutants , are all approached exponentially with a common time constant asymptotically @xcite .",
    "this time constant can then be used to define an effective population size .    one way to do",
    "this is to consider the change per generation in the probability that two individuals sampled from the population are identical by descent , i.e. , share a common ancestor @xcite .",
    "let us recapitulate here the derivation of the formula for asymptotic effective size given by @xcite for the model of population subdivision that will be used throughout this work .",
    "this model comprises @xmath6 demes , each having a fixed subpopulation size @xmath7 . after a generation of reproduction and migration , the probability that an individual in deme @xmath8 is an offspring of a parent in deme @xmath9 is @xmath10 , hence @xmath11 for all @xmath8 .",
    "given the set of probabilities @xmath12 that two individuals , one sampled from deme @xmath8 , one from deme @xmath9 , share a common ancestor , one finds one generation later that the corresponding set of probabilities are given by @xmath13 this form arises because if the parents of the two sampled individuals came from different demes @xmath14 and @xmath15 , they are identical by descent with probability @xmath16 , whereas if the parents are from the same deme @xmath14 they have a probability @xmath17 of being the same individual ( and hence genetically identical in the absence of mutation ) whereas otherwise the probability they are identical is @xmath18 .    to simplify this expression",
    ", we introduce the important quantity @xmath19 which is defined as follows .",
    "consider some subset of the present - day population , and trace its ancestry backwards in time until a single common ancestor is found .",
    "now , if one keeps tracing backwards in time , this ancestor will hop from deme to deme and eventually the probability that it is to be found in deme @xmath8 approaches the stationary value @xmath19 . since",
    "a hop from deme @xmath8 to @xmath9 occurs with a probability @xmath10 per generation , these stationary probabilities satisfy the equation @xmath20 multiplying both sides of ( [ f ] ) by @xmath21 and summing over all @xmath8 and @xmath9 , one then finds that @xmath22 where @xmath23 . as @xmath24 , the probability that any pair of individuals share a common ancestor approaches unity under neutral evolution . as this limit of infinite time",
    "is approached , one can unambiguously define an asymptotic effective size of the subdivided population through @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of generations that have elapsed since imposing some initial condition .",
    "one way to interpret this equation is as an average of coalescence rates @xmath27 of two lineages present in the same deme @xmath8 in the limit @xmath24 _ given _ that they have not previously coalesced @xcite .",
    "if migration is a fast process , one can envisage that the identity probability @xmath12 is roughly the same for all pairs of demes @xmath8 and @xmath9 . under such conditions",
    ", the formula simplifies to @xmath28 this formula was obtained by an independent means by @xcite , and was shown to be valid in the limit of infinite deme sizes when migration rates per generation satisfy @xmath29 , an expression that defines a fast migration limit ( see * ? ? ? * for a fuller discussion of the various limits that are of interest ) . for intermediate migration rates",
    ", @xcite presented a formula in which the denominator of ( [ ne ] ) is replaced by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the identity probability averaged uniformly over all pairs of individuals in the population .    in this work",
    "we are almost exclusively interested in the slow migration limit , where deme sizes again again approach infinity , but one has @xmath32 .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "firstly , this is the limit that naturally arose in the model of language change previously described @xcite . in a population genetics context",
    "this limit is also relevant when the subpopulation sizes are large and one is interested in the evolution over a number of generations that is of the order of these subpopulation sizes .",
    "finally , it is a limit in which any deviation from panmictic behaviour  such as sensitivity to an initial distribution of mutants  would be most likely to arise , and thus worth exploring from a more theoretical point of view ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the different phenomenology in the fast and slow migration limits ) .",
    "we remark that this is not the only slow migration limit that can be taken : one can also take @xmath33 at fixed population sizes and measure time in units of @xmath34 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for clarity , we reiterate that throughout most of this work , we deal with a slow migration limit in which deme population sizes @xmath7 are infinite , and migration rates are inversely proportional to this size .",
    "furthermore , for reasons to be discussed in the next section , we will most often be dealing with the extreme case where the coefficients are vanishingly small .    in this limit ,",
    "it is unclear whether one can simply use the expression ( [ ne ] ) for the effective size that appears in eq .",
    "( [ tideal ] ) for the fixation time .",
    "tracing the ancestry of a state of fixation backwards in time , the extreme slow migration regime could lead to a situation in which the majority of the relevant coalesence events occur long before the time at which the mean coalescence rate given by the right - hand size of ( [ ne ] ) is reached .",
    "we also remark that it has also been argued that only when lineages are able to equilibrate through a rapid migration process between coalescent events , is it appropriate to characterise the coalescence rates by a single effective population size @xcite .",
    "this fact is particularly relevant when considering a final state of fixation , since one must trace the ancestry of the entire population .",
    "finally , whether or not the effective population size turns out to provide good estimates of fixation times in the slow migration limit , it does not provide a framework for understanding how fixation times vary with the initial distribution of mutants .    to assess the utility of the asymptotic effective population size in characterising fixation timescales , and to investigate the effect of varying the initial condition",
    ", we develop a formalism within which the spatial distribution of mutants as a function of time can ( in principle , at least ) be calculated exactly given any initial distribution and model of a subdivided population undergoing neutral genetic drift .",
    "specialising to the case of a final state of fixation , we can extract via eq .",
    "( [ tideal ] ) a measure of effective population size and compare with its asymptotic counterpart using eq .",
    "( [ ne ] ) .",
    "as has been hinted above , the approach we use is based on the backward time coalescent process @xcite that has found many applications in the context of drift in subdivided populations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main benefit of this approach is that lineages that do not contribute to the final state of fixation are explicitly excluded from the mathematical description .",
    "however , a fixed initial condition does not enter naturally in this description , and so some work is needed to match this up with the distribution of ancestors of the present day state of fixation . as we have already remarked , population subdivision is harder to handle in diffusion - equation - based approaches , although the initial condition is more easily enforced and extensions to alleles with a selective advantage can be treated more straightforwardly ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the next section we will present the details of the derivation of the exact formula relating forward- and backward - time properties to one another , and",
    "demonstrate the simplifications that occur in the limit of extemely slow migration .",
    "the rest of this work is then devoted to consequences of this formula under different models of subdivision .",
    "it is worth at this early stage to fix the basic ideas underlying the approach by considering the simple case of fixation probability as a function of initial condition .",
    "consider therefore the probability that a mutant allele fixes when initially a fraction @xmath35 of the individuals in deme @xmath8 are mutants .",
    "we denote this probability @xmath36 , where at this stage @xmath37 is a shorthand for the initial condition ( we will define it more formally below ) .",
    "if we look infinitely far forward in time from this initial state , fixation of either the mutant or the wild type is guaranteed to have occurred . then rewinding infinitely far from the final state back to the initial state",
    ", we find a single ancestor in deme @xmath8 with probability @xmath19 as previously discussed .",
    "since the initial assignment of mutants to individuals in the population is completely independent of the ensuing population dynamics , this ancestor is a mutant with probability @xmath35 .",
    "hence , the fixation probability is simply @xmath38 thus to find the fixation probability from any initial condition , it is enough to know the distribution @xmath19 which is the stationary distribution of the markovian migration process running backwards in time . since finding this stationary distribution is a fairly standard problem in the theory of stochastic processes , we shall not consider it in further detail here , other than to remark that through variation in the migration rates , it is possible to construct models in which @xmath19 for some deme @xmath8 is close to one . if selectively neutral mutants initially completely occupy that deme they are then almost guaranteed to spread to the whole population .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the phenomenon discussed by @xcite , in which it was seen that the spatial structure of the population could give rise to a mutant fixing with near certainty .",
    "the distinction is that in that work , the mutant was considered to have a selective advantage and thus that the initial location played only a minor role in the probability of fixation . under neutral genetic drift",
    ", the situation is reversed : the same mutation can fix or go extinct with near certainty depending on where it occurs .",
    "this will be demonstrated explicitly in section  [ singleseed ] below .    before this ,",
    "in section  [ ranic ] we derive from the exact formul  presented in section  [ prelim ] an expression that holds for arbitrary population subdivision and gives the mean fixation time from an initial condition in which mutants are randomly distributed with an overall frequency @xmath2",
    ". this would be the appropriate initial condition to use , for example , when modelling a historical situation for which initial mutant frequencies , but not their location , are known .",
    "we learn that the resulting expression involves the mean times to particular coalescence events from the final state of fixation , which need then to be obtained either analytically or by monte carlo sampling .",
    "one case in which the former is possible is wright s island model @xcite ; furthermore , the formula can be extended to an arbitrary initial condition .",
    "therefore , in section  [ wright ] we are able to perform a number of exact calculations for this very well - studied model , apparently for the first time .",
    "for example , we can consider in addition to the initial condition that has mutants initially randomly scattered across all islands with some overall mutant frequency @xmath2 the contrasting case where the same number of mutants are all initially confined to the smallest possible number of islands . in genetics terms , these two different initial conditions correspond to the two extreme values of the inbreeding coefficient @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "for the island model , we show that the difference in fixation time for these two initial conditions is short on the timescale of fixation which grows linearly with the number of demes .",
    "we further provide evidence that fixation from any non - random initial condition is slower than from a random initial condition . for more general models ,",
    "exact calculations are much more difficult .",
    "nevertheless , we introduce a formula for fixation time from a single mutation with known location ( a case of practical interest ) to the statistics of the most recent common ancestor of the whole population .",
    "this will be explained in section  [ singleseed ] . by combining analytical results with numerical data from simulations we explore fixation times , and their variation with initial condition , in two concrete and contrasting models in which there demes fall into clusters within which migration occurs at different rates than between demes from different clusters .",
    "our interest here is in how fixation times grow with increasing number of demes , either by adding more demes to each cluster , or by adding clusters of fixed size . whilst the former case has been considered in a number of works ( such as",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we obtain in this work some evidence that in the latter case , the mean time to fixation can remain _ finite _ in the limit of an infinite number of demes . this effect  and the general growth law for the fixation time in a subdivided population  is predicted by the effective size formula ( [ ne ] ) in the slow migration limit . in all cases other than that in which fixation in a finite time",
    "is seen , the coefficient of the growth law is also accurately predicted by ( [ ne ] ) .",
    "we discuss possible origins for the discrepancy that remains , along with implications of our findings for more plausible models of social interaction and migration between biological populations in the conclusion , section  [ discon ] .",
    "we begin by deriving an expression for the distribution of mutants that is valid for any model of population subdivision and arbitrary initial condition .",
    "we do however stipulate that under the population dynamics that an individual s chances of leaving offspring in the next generation are unaffected by whether it is a mutant or not ( i.e. , there is no selection ) , and that subpopulation sizes and migration rates are constant in time .    as stated in the introduction ,",
    "we consider a population that is subdivided into @xmath6 demes with @xmath7 individuals in deme @xmath8 .",
    "the initial condition , denoted @xmath37 , is specified by the number of mutants @xmath41 in each deme , @xmath42 .",
    "two distinct distributions are central to this work .",
    "the first is the probability @xmath43 that after @xmath26 generations of reproduction within and migration between demes , all descendants of @xmath37 form the set @xmath44 , i.e. , a distribution with precisely @xmath45 mutants in deme @xmath8 .",
    "the second is the probability @xmath46 that all ancestors of a present - day sample @xmath47 formed @xmath26 generations previously the set @xmath48 .",
    "the quantities @xmath49 and @xmath50 are defined analogously to @xmath41 and @xmath45 for these sets .",
    "these two distributions are connected by a duality relation that was given by @xcite for the panmictic case , @xmath51 .",
    "the generalisation to @xmath52 is found by recalling that  in the absence of selection  the assignment of mutant alleles to individuals within the population is a process independent of the population dynamics .",
    "we proceed by constructing equivalent expressions ",
    "one for @xmath53 and one for @xmath54for the probability of the event that a set of individuals @xmath37 contains all ancestors of some set of individuals @xmath47 present in the population @xmath26 generations later . to be clear",
    ", the set @xmath37 must contain at least the ancestors of individuals in @xmath47 , and may additionally contain ancestors of individuals outside @xmath47 , or individuals that have no descendants at the later time ; likewise , descendants of @xmath37 may form a superset of the individuals in @xmath47 . therefore ,",
    "we obtain the desired probability by summing @xmath43 over all sets of individuals @xmath44 that contain @xmath47 ; meanwhile @xmath46 must be summed over all sets @xmath48 that are contained within @xmath37 . in both cases ,",
    "the sum must be weighted by the probability that one randomly chosen set is contained within the other .",
    "the expression that results is @xmath55    in this work , we will find @xmath46 , or quantities derived from it , either analytically or numerically , and use this duality relation to derive new formul  relating to fixation .",
    "this requires us to to rearrange the implicit expression ( [ dual ] ) so that the forward - time probability @xmath53 ( that relates to fixation statistics ) is given explicitly in terms of @xmath54 .",
    "this is achieved by making use of the identity @xmath56 in which @xmath57 is the kronecker delta symbol . here , the first step is achieved by expanding the binomial coefficients in terms of factorials , making some cancellations and recombining remaining factorials as binomial coefficients . then , if @xmath58 , the sum is zero by definition ; if @xmath59 , the alternating binomial coefficients sum to zero ( see e.g. , formula ( 0.15.4 ) in * ? ? ? * ) ; if @xmath60 one can easily verify that that the resulting expression equals unity , as required . multiplying both sides of ( [ dual ] ) by @xmath61 and summing over all @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath49 one finds @xmath62 after dropping the prime on the variables @xmath45 that remain . for a final state of fixation , @xmath63 and this expression simplifies to @xmath64 in which we have introduced the notation @xmath65 for the probability of fixation from an initial distribution of mutants @xmath37 , and @xmath66 for the distribution of ancestors of the entire population a time @xmath26 previously .",
    "although we are concerned only with fixation in this work , we remark that ( [ pofq ] ) has wider applicability and could form the basis of further studies of genetic drift in a subdivided population . we also note ",
    "although we have no use for it here  that it is possible to write down a similar explicit formula for @xmath54 in terms of @xmath53 by making use of the identity ( [ i d ] ) .    in the remainder of this work we specialise to the slow migration limit for the reasons outlined in the introduction .",
    "in particular we know @xcite that if @xmath10 is the probability that an individual sampled at random from deme @xmath8 had a parent from the previous generation in deme @xmath9 , the overall population behaves like a panmictic population with an effective size given by eq .",
    "( [ nenag ] ) if one has @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mean deme size .",
    "since we are most interested in those cases where deviation from panmixia is most likely , and genetic diversity is maintained for the longest periods of time before the onset of fixation , we shall insist that @xmath69 holds for all @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in this limit",
    "it is convenient to work in rescaled time units , so that that one unit of time corresponds to @xmath68 generations of the underlying population dynamics .",
    "these rescaled time units will be in force until the end of this work .    in these rescaled time units ,",
    "the backwards - time hopping of lineages becomes in the limit @xmath70 a continuous - time process in which a hop from deme @xmath8 to @xmath9 occurs with rate @xmath71 .",
    "meanwhile , pairs of lineages collocated in deme @xmath8 coalesce at a rate @xmath72 which is assumed to remain finite in the limit @xmath70 .",
    "the fact that both of these processes occur on the same timescale makes calculation of @xmath66 in general difficult , since coalescence and migration events are intermingled . to simplify the calculations",
    ", we shall further assume that all the migration rates @xmath71 are proportional to some vanishingly small parameter @xmath73 .",
    "this defines an extreme slow migration limit that we shall henceforth assume is in operation .",
    "then , we expect that the probability that a migration event occurs in the time it takes all lineages that are present in a single deme to coalesce vanishes with @xmath73 , even in the limit of an infinite system .",
    "this expectation is based on the fact that the fixation time in an ideal population is of order one ( in the rescaled time units ) , one can choose @xmath73 sufficiently small that the probability that all lineages coalesce before any of them migrate elsewhere with arbitrarily high probability .",
    "we note that for large , but finite , populations this assumption has been used previously by @xcite and formally proved by @xcite ; furthermore , @xcite gives grounds to believe that in an infinite population , only a finite number of lineages remain at any nonzero ( rescaled ) time .",
    "given that this is the case , the probability for there to be more than one ancestor in any deme at a time of order @xmath74 vanishes , and hence all the sums over @xmath50 in ( [ pat ] ) can be truncated at @xmath75 .",
    "this yields for the fixation probability as a function of time the expression @xmath76 which is the fundamental equation that will be used repeatedly in this work . here",
    ", @xmath77 is the initial fraction of the individuals in deme @xmath8 that are mutants and by convention we take @xmath78 whenever @xmath79 .",
    "any timescales calculated from this expression will thus be proportional to @xmath74 , and it is to be understood that any times @xmath80 quoted in the following are believed to have the property that the combination @xmath81 is exact in the limit of extremely slow migration , @xmath82 .",
    "we remark that the formula for the ultimate probability of fixation , eq .",

    "one way that this can be assured is if it is possible for every deme to be reached from any other through some sequence of migration events , as is well known from the theory of markov chains ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our first application of the formula ( [ pfix ] ) concerns a random initial condition @xmath85 in which a fraction @xmath2 of all individuals are mutants , but are spatially distributed uniformly at random .",

    "we reiterate that this expression , believed not to have appeared before , is valid for any set of migration rates ( at least , in the extreme slow migration limit ) and further remark that when the coalescence times @xmath110 can not be obtained analytically , they can be easily estimated by monte carlo sampling of the genealogies .",
    "a model for which fixation times can be calculated analytically for any initial condition is wright s island model @xcite .",

    "an expression in terms of entry times @xmath110 is possible only because all states with @xmath97 ancestors are equiprobable at a given time in the history of the dynamics .",
    "the entry times themselves can be calculated easily because , as in an ideal population , the rate of coalescence from a state with @xmath97 lineages to one with @xmath119 lineages is a poisson process that occurs with a rate proportional to @xmath120 . in the slow migration limit ,",
    "the constant of proportionality is @xmath121 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the difference between the fixation time for the inhomogeneous and homogeneous initial conditions ( @xmath131 and @xmath85 respectively ) is @xmath140 as this difference is small on the timescale of fixation , which grows linearly with the number of demes @xmath6 , we suggest that an inhomogeneous initial condition relaxes quickly to a homogeneous state .",

    "we conclude this section by arguing that the homogeneous ( or random ) initial condition gives the shortest fixation time of all possible distributions that have an overall fraction @xmath2 of mutants in the population . to show this",

    "although this demonstrates only that this is an extremal fixation time , the fact that the fixation occurs more slowly from an inhomogeneous initial condition ( at least for large @xmath6 ) is suggestive that the extremum is a minimum , particularly since the analysis just outlined also shows that the point @xmath147 ( for all @xmath8 ) is the only extremum in the interior of the @xmath148-dimensional space of independent parameters @xmath35 .",
    "for models of migration that have more structure than wright s island model , calculation of the fixation time from an arbitrary initial condition is much more difficult .",
    "we thus specialise to the comparatively simple case of an initial condition that has a single mutant in the entire population .",
    "our approach is to assume that certain statistical properties of the most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) of the whole population are known , e.g. , from an explicit calculation or monte carlo sampling .",
    "then , starting from ( [ taudef ] ) we derive a new formula for the fixation time from a single mutation as a function of its location .",

    "we now determine fixation times in two concrete models of population subdivision undergoing extremely slow migration .",
    "the first is similar to wright s island model , in that migration is permitted between every pair of demes .",

    "note that the diagonal elements of the matrix of migration rates will be altered as a consequence of exchanging the off - diagonal elements so that probability is conserved ; note also that for the two - level model , both rules are equivalent .",

    "this implies that ratios of stationary probabilities satisfy the relation @xmath253 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 label demes . introducing @xmath254 for the _ total _",

    "however , since there are ( for @xmath259 ) more spoke demes than hub demes , a mutation occurring in the hub is @xmath260 times more likely to fix than one occurring in the spoke . under the uniform emigration rule , the opposite is true , a mutation somewhere in the spoke being @xmath260 times more likely to fix .",

    "the aim of this work was to develop a better understanding of the effects of population subdivision on fixation under neutral genetic drift .",
    "this was achieved by exploiting a connection between forward- and backward - time properties of neutral genetic drift which admitted the derivation of a number of new results for fixation properties in subdivided populations that are exact in the limit of extemely slow migration . since the underlying motivation was partly to assess the viability of genetic drift as a mechanism for propagating a social change , we were particularly interested in establishing how fixation times grow with the number of demes",
    ". furthermore , the existence of historical data requires knowledge of variation of fixation times with the initial distribution of mutants .",
    "we address the matter of variation first .",
    "it is clear from the elementary considerations leading to eq .",
    "( [ past ] ) that fixation probability can vary greatly with the initial location of mutants .",
    "for example , if one has in the hub - and - spoke model a mutation which is known to be located in the hub , it is @xmath260 times more likely to invade the whole population than the same mutation occurring in a spoke , as long as the uniform immigration rule is applied .",
    "thus , if the number of spokes is very large , one can approach near certainty for a mutation to fix by genetic drift alone .",
    "however , this is balanced by the fact that there are @xmath260 fewer hub demes than spoke demes , so a mutation occurring at a random location is as unlikely to fix in this subdivided population as any other with the same overall size .",
    "we contrast again with the findings of @xcite which showed almost certain fixation from a random initial condition driven by selection in a spatially structured population .",
    "such behaviour can also arise without the need for selection as long as one is able to position the initial mutations strategically , as would be the case when one is constrained by historical data .",
    "conversely , we observed only minor variation with the initial condition in the mean fixation time , averaged over those realisations of the dynamics where fixation actually occurs .",
    "this was seen both in new exact results for wright s island model ( section  [ wright ] ) and in numerical data for clustered models ( section  [ egs ] ) .",
    "in fact , in all cases the relative magnitude of variation vanishes in the limit of an infinite system , except possibly in the case where the fixation time remained constant in that limit .",
    "however , even there , the variation was of the order of a few percent .",
    "this lack of variation has two practical benefits .",
    "first , one may as well approximate any historical data by a random initial condition with the same overall frequency of mutants , and use eq .",
    "( [ taurt ] ) to calculate fixation times from the coalescence times @xmath110 which are easy to obtain numerically .",
    "we remark that this formula can easily be generalised to find higher cumulants of the fixation time distribution .",
    "the second benefit is that if one notices considerable variation of fixation times in historical data , it may then be possible to rule out genetic drift as a propagation mechanism as a consequence .",
    "finally , on the subject of variation , a curiosity that emerged from the exact analysis of wright s island model was evidence for mean time to fixation to be minimised ( subject to a constraint of a fixed overall mutant frequency ) by a random initial condition",
    ". it would be interesting to show this more rigorously , and to see if this is also the case for a wider class of models .    by considering the fate of a single mutation in models that had demes grouped into tightly - knit clusters , we established three different growth laws for the fixation time under various conditions : linear ( as in wright s island model ) , quadratic and approach to a constant .",
    "the latter scenario is , of course , the most intriguing , since then one has a population - level change occurring in an infinite population in a finite time through genetic drift alone .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon lies in the nonconservative nature of the migration process in place : the total number of individuals entering the spokes from the hub under the constant immigration rule vastly exceeds the number entering the hub .",
    "this has the consequence that , as one goes backward in time , the probability of finding pair of lineages in a vanishingly small region of space ( the hub ) remains finite as the number of demes is increased ; thus their coalescence , and hence fixation , can occur in a finite time .",
    "by contrast , under the uniform emigration rule , the probability that lineages are found in separate spokes is finite , and one must wait a long time until they are both present in the same deme : this drives the superlinear increase in fixation time .",
    "although in a biological context the hub - and - spoke model may be of limited application , one can think of this enhancement of offspring number as a form of spatially - dependent selection and it would perhaps be of interest to see if a similar effect is evident in potentially more realistic situations where the deme sizes are small and their number restricted by topological considerations .    on the other hand , in the cultural context of language change where migration corresponds to a speaker retaining a record of another s utterances , there is no particular reason to assume conservative migration .",
    "in fact , a uniform immigration rule as implemented in this work arises rather naturally , as it corresponds to every speaker dividing the same amount of attention equally between each person she listens to .",
    "furthermore , the hub - and - spoke model probably better reflects the nature of social interactions , in which some members of society have more long - range connections than others .",
    "it is unclear , however , if the phenomenon of a finite fixation time will be seen for infinite populations on more realistic social networks .",
    "we are currently investigating this possibility , and results will be reported in due course .    finally , we compared results from simulations with predictions from a formula for effective population size , eq .",
    "( [ ne ] ) whose general form was given by @xcite and that was specialised here to the extreme slow migration limit in which all migration rates are inversely proportional to the deme size and have a vanishingly small coefficient .",
    "the resulting formula , ( [ alphae ] ) , was found to give precise predictions for the fixation time in the limit of an infinite number of demes for all models considered , except when the fixation time appears to be bounded by a constant ; here , the predicted asymptote was seen to be exceeded by as much as @xmath304 .",
    "this would suggest that in this particular case , the fixation time is not well characterised by the asymptotic coalescence rate that appears on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ne ] ) . to explore this possibility ,",
    "it is worth considering the extreme case of two demes with arbitrary migration rates @xmath310 , @xmath311 in the extreme slow migration limit @xmath82 . if one starts with one lineage per deme in this model , the rate of coalescence between these lineages is @xmath312 , since that is the rate at which one of the lineages hops from one deme to another , at which time a coalescence immediately takes place ( as least in the limit @xmath82 ) .",
    "by contrast , the mean asymptotic rate of coalesence given by the asmyptotic effective size formula ( [ alphae ] ) is @xmath313 $ ] where @xmath314 . for any choice of migration rates , the true rate of coalescence between the last pair of lineages",
    "is overestimated by a least a factor of @xmath315 , and hence the effective population size underestimated as was seen for the hub - and - spoke model .",
    "this two - demes model provides an extreme example of a case where all coalesences occur before the onset of the asymptotic regime .",
    "we believe this is also what is happening in the hub - and - spoke model , and could further explain why this is the only case in this work in which any variation of fixation time with initial condition was observed . through more careful considerations of the relevant coalescence events",
    "@xcite , one anticipates that better predictions for the fixation time can be obtained .",
    "we end by remarking that if one is only interested in the general scaling of the fixation time with the number of demes ( and not in precise estimates of the coefficients ) , the simple formula of @xcite , @xmath316 , is much easier to apply than the full expression ( [ ne ] ) and can be used as long as lineages are well mixed by the dynamics and fluctuation effects are unimportant .",
    "an example of a model in which this simple formula gives the wrong prediction for scaling is the stepping - stone model in two dimensions and less @xcite .",
    "it is also perhaps worth noting that the stepping - stone model in the slow - migration limit @xmath82 is equivalent to the particle reaction system @xmath317 that has been of interest to physicists @xcite .",
    "the methods that have been employed in this context allow , in principle , the distribution of ancestors @xmath46 appearing in the general relation ( [ pofq ] ) to be calculated for the stepping stone model in one dimension",
    ". it would be interesting to exploit this connection to obtain further new results for the properties of fixation in subdivided populations .",
