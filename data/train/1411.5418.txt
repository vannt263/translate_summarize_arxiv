    "for @xmath1 and an oriented knot @xmath2 in @xmath3 , let @xmath4 $ ] be the @xmath5-colored jones polynomial of @xmath2 normalized so that @xmath6 .",
    "as melvin - morton proved @xcite , by putting @xmath7 , the colored jones polynomials can be expanded as a power series of two independent variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as @xmath10 further , we put @xmath11 and write the colored jones polynomials as a function on @xmath9 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 we call @xmath14 the _ colored jones function _ or , the _ loop expansion of quantum @xmath0-invariant _ since it coincides with the @xmath0 weight system reduction of the loop expansion of the kontsevich invariant . in particular , the @xmath15-th coefficient @xmath16 corresponds to the @xmath17-st loop part of the loop expansion of the kontsevich invariant @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 be the conway polynomial of @xmath2 , characterized by the skein relation @xmath19 and let @xmath20 be the alexander - conway polynomial .",
    "the alexander - conway polynomial appears as one of the basic building block of @xmath14 .",
    "the melvin - morton - ronzansky conjecture @xcite ( mmr conjecture , in short ) , proven in @xcite , states that the @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "more generally , @xmath16 is a rational function whose denominator is @xmath23 @xcite .    in a theory of quantum invariants , the appearance of the alexander - conway polynomial is well - understood .",
    "the aforementioned rationality of @xmath16 follows from ronzansky s rationality conjecture @xcite of the loop expansion of kontsevich invariant , proven in @xcite : the aarhus integral computation of kontsevich ( or , lmo ) invariant , based on a surgery presentation of knots , provides the desired rationality ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.2 ) for a brief summary of kricker s argument ) .    the clasper surgery @xcite explains a geometric connection between the loop expansion and infinite cyclic covering @xcite .",
    "a null - clasper , a clasper with null - homologous leaves in the knot complement , lifts to a clasper in the infinite cyclic covering , and the loop expansion nicely behaves under the clasper surgery along null - claspers .",
    "thus schematically speaking , the loop expansion provides a @xmath24-equivariant quantum invariants @xcite ( for example , the 2-loop part can be interpreted as the @xmath24-equivariant casson invariant , as discussed in @xcite ) , so it is not surprising that the alexander - conway polynomial appears in the loop expansion .    nevertheless , it is still mysterious why the alexander polynomial appears in such a particular and direct form . even for the mmr conjecture , the simplest and the most fundamental rationality result ,",
    "the situation is not so good as we want . in a known proof",
    ", one uses quantum - invariant - like treatment of the alexander - conway polynomial such as , state - sum , r - matrix , or weight systems so its topological content is often indirect .    in this paper",
    ", we give a topological formula of @xmath14 by using homological braid group representations ( theorem [ theorem : main ] ) .",
    "our starting point is a recent result in @xcite that identifies certain homological representations introduced by lawrence @xcite with generic @xmath25 representations .",
    "this allows us to translate a construction of the colored jones function in terms of corresponding homological representations .",
    "also , in section [ sec : ent ] we discuss a connection among the entropy of braids , quantum representations , and the growth of quantum @xmath0 invariants inspired from topological point of view .",
    "one may notice that our approach is similar to lawrence - bigelow s approach of jones polynomial @xcite , but there are several critical differences : we give a formula of the loop expansion @xmath14 but do not provide a formula of each individual colored jones polynomials .",
    "our formula uses closed braid representatives , whereas lawrence - bigelow description uses plat representatives and intersection products .",
    "it should be emphasized that quantum representations coming from finite dimensional @xmath25-module is _ not _ identified with homological representation .",
    "this is the reason why we do not have a direct topological formula of usual colored jones polynomials .",
    "our topological description leads to several insights .",
    "first , the mmr conjecture is now obtained as a direct consequence of our topological formula . by putting @xmath26 , topological considerations",
    "show that the homological representations is equal to the symmetric powers of the reduced burau representation , so they naturally lead to the alexander - conway polynomial .",
    "second , our formula gives a new and direct way to calculate @xmath27 without knowing or computing individual colored jones polynomial @xmath28 or appealing surgery presentation of knots , although a general calculation is still difficult .",

    "he would like to thank tomotada ohtsuki , jun murakami and hitoshi murakami for stimulating discussion and comments .",
    "in this section we review the result in @xcite that identifies a generic quantum @xmath0 representation given in @xcite with lawrence s homological representation and some additional arguments to treat non - generic case .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the following notations and conventions .",
