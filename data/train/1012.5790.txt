    "we show that cutting along an arc corresponds categorically to iyama - yoshino reduction . in particular , the coloured quiver after cutting along an arc in a partial triangulation",
    "can be obtained from the coloured quiver of the partial triangulation by deleting a vertex . in section 5",
    "we show that , for a partial triangulation of a surface and the corresponding rigid object in the cluster category of the surface , the two notions of coloured quiver coincide . in section @xmath25",
    "we show that mutation in the type @xmath24 case can be described purely in terms of the coloured quiver and give an explicit description .",
