    "ever since the discovery of a hidden broad - line region ( blr ) in ngc 1068 ( @xcite ) , spectropolarimetric observations have provided a powerful means to detect fundamental similarities among the diverse and often bewildering menagerie of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "unified models , based in large part on evidence from spectropolarimetry , have been very successful at explaining the impact of viewing angle on our classification of many different types of high - luminosity agns ( @xcite ) , but little is known about the place of low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) within the unification framework .",
    "the division between low- and high - luminosity agns is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "ideally this distinction should be made on the basis of bolometric luminosities , but these are not available for most nearby agns , and there is no clear physical basis for choosing a particular luminosity threshold for separating low- and high - luminosity objects .",
    "one criterion which is adequate for most purposes and observationally straightforward is the luminosity in the narrow  line .",
    "ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1997a ) note that typical seyfert nuclei in the markarian catalog have  luminosities of @xmath1 erg s(e.g . , @xcite ) , while in the ho sample of 500 nearby galaxies , 85% of the agns have @xmath4 ( ) @xmath5 erg s. ho ( 1997a ) propose that llagns may be defined operationally as those agns having @xmath4 ( ) @xmath6 erg s. we will adopt this definition here , bearing in mind the ambiguities brought about by anisotropic emission , the uncertain fraction of the bolometric luminosity contributed by , and the uncertainties in the distances to these nearby galaxies .",
    "low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions , or liners ( @xcite ) , are one class of llagns to which unified models have not been applied in the past .",
    "about 15% of liners have a broad component of the emission line ( @xcite ) , similar to the fraction of seyferts which are broad - lined , and we will refer to `` liner 1 '' and `` liner 2 '' nuclei as those in which broad  emission is detected or undetected , respectively , in the total flux spectrum . despite some observational effort in the past using 3-m and 4-m telescopes ( see @xcite and barth 1998 ) , it has never been determined whether the faint broad  wings in liner 1 nuclei are viewed directly or in scattered light .",
    "it is also not known whether some fraction of the liner 2 population may contain `` hidden '' type 1 nuclei .",
    "the latter question is of particular importance because some liner 2 nuclei may not be agns at all ; it is sometimes possible to explain their optical emission - line ratios and energetics in terms of shock heating ( @xcite ) or ionization by hot stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , rather than by agn - like photoionization by a nonstellar continuum source .",
    "since approximately one quarter of all nearby galaxies have liner 2 nuclei ( @xcite ) , our understanding of the faint end of the agn luminosity function depends crucially on determining the power source in these objects .",
    "the detection of polarized nonstellar continua and broad emission lines in liner 2 galaxies would provide convincing evidence that these objects do contain genuine low - luminosity active nuclei .",
    "unfortunately , several difficulties conspire to make the detection of polarization in llagns extremely challenging .",
    "the optical continua are typically dominated by unpolarized starlight , and it is generally impossible to detect any featureless continuum contribution to the total flux spectrum . due to this starlight contamination",
    ", the continuum polarization in llagns is expected to be at a level of @xmath7 , and such small intrinsic polarizations can easily be masked by foreground interstellar polarization . in some llagns the central engines may be hidden by dust lanes in the host galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and obscuration of this sort would not lead to any polarization signature , except possibly through dust transmission . in the well - studied case of ngc 1068 , the nuclear polarization is the result of scattering by electrons ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but a similar electron - scattering medium might not be present in low - luminosity , low - ionization agns . finally , some fraction of liner 2 nuclei may derive their power from hot stars , rather than from an agn , in which case no hidden blr would be present at all .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that very high signal - to - noise ratios ( ) will be required in order to detect optical polarization in llagns , and that most llagns will not be polarized at any detectable level other than from dust transmission .",
    "much progress has been made recently in searching for hidden blrs in starlight - dominated agns ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but previous surveys have not concentrated on llagns or liners specifically . in order to determine whether polarized broad emission lines occur in llagns , we have undertaken a spectropolarimetric survey at the keck observatory .",
    "our first detection of polarized broad - line emission , in the liner ngc 1052 , has been published separately ( barth , filippenko , & moran 1999a ) .",
    "this paper presents the data we have collected to date for this project , for a total of 14 objects .",
    "the observations were made during four observing runs at the keck - ii telescope , on 1997 december 20 , 1998 january 17 , 1998 march 7 , and 1999 january 6 ( ut ) .",
    "targets were selected from the liners and seyfert nuclei observed in the ho ( 1997a ) spectroscopic survey , and the well - known southern - hemisphere liner ngc 1097 was included as well .",
    "the galaxies observed do not form a statistically meaningful sample ; our primary goal was to determine whether polarized emission could be detected in the brightest liners , and we selected objects having emission lines of high brightness and large equivalent width .",
    "table [ journal ] lists the galaxy sample .",
    "most of the targets have faint broad  emisison in total flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "the narrow  luminosities listed in table [ journal ] are taken from ho ( 1997c ) or from other sources in the literature for those objects which were not observed under photometric conditions by ho et al .",
    "five galaxies exceed the nominal @xmath8 erg scutoff for classification as `` low - luminosity '' objects , but all have luminosities below the typical @xmath4 ( ) of @xmath9 erg s  for markarian seyfert nuclei .",
    "the median  luminosity of the sample is @xmath10 erg s.    observations were obtained with the lris spectropolarimeter ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , using a 600 grooves mm  grating blazed at 5000   and a slit width of 1 .",
    "the spectra covered approximately 43206860  , with a resolution of @xmath11   and a pixel scale of 1.2   bin .",
    "seeing and weather conditions were @xmath12 with clear skies during the december 1997 run , @xmath13 with thick clouds during the january 1998 run , @xmath14 with clear skies during the march 1998 run , and @xmath15 with thick clouds during the january 1999 run .",
    "exposure times for the individual targets are listed in table [ journal ] .",
    "most exposures were obtained with the slit oriented at the parallactic angle , but for a few objects at low airmass ( @xmath16 ) the slit was oriented at p.a .",
    "= 90 . total exposure times ranged from 10 to 70 minutes per galaxy .",
    "due to the wide range in emission - line and continuum fluxes of these galaxies , as well as to rapid changes in atmospheric conditions during parts of these nights , the resulting  varied from object to object .",
    "the spectra were flat - fielded , extracted , and wavelength- and flux - calibrated using iraf .",
    "subsequent spectropolarimetric processing was performed using routines written in idl , following the methods described by miller , robinson , & goodrich ( 1988 ) and cohen ( 1997 ) .",
    "uncertainties due to photon - counting statistics and detector readout noise were propagated at every step of the reduction process , yielding `` error spectra '' for the stokes parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "extractions were 2652 wide , depending on the seeing and the spatial profile of each individual galaxy .",
    "the large extraction widths were chosen in order to minimize the amplitude of spurious features in the continuum ; in narrower ( 1 - 2 ) extractions , broad and narrow bumps appeared in the continuum polarization spectra with amplitudes of a few tenths of a percent . such features in @xmath19 can arise from uncertainties in interpolating counts in fractional pixels at the edges of the extraction aperture , due to the finite sampling ( 043 pixel size ) of the galaxy s spatial profile .",
    "these spurious features in @xmath19 can be coherent over a broad wavelength range , as they depend on the spatial profile of the galaxy , the centering of the galaxy profile on the detector pixels , and the accuracy of the spectral traces .",
    "since the amplitude of these errors depends on the fraction of total flux contributed by the outermost pixel on each side of the extraction aperture , extractions were performed with apertures sufficiently wide that the outermost pixels did not contribute substantially to the total flux .",
    "this issue only becomes problematic when one is searching for true features in @xmath19 at the level of a few tenths of a percent in spatially extended sources .",
    "for point sources , such as the standard stars , the best approach is to use a wide extraction together with an optimal weighting algorithm ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the outermost pixels in a wide aperture contribute negligibly to the total counts .",
    "the extracted spectra were rebinned to 2   bin  prior to the polarimetric analysis .",
    "cosmic - ray spikes were removed by comparing adjacent pairs of extracted spectra . to account for slight shifts in wavelength among the eight individual extracted spectra from each observing sequence ,",
    "the spectra were aligned in wavelength to within 0.1   by measuring their cross - correlations .",
    "the instrumental polarization response was checked each night using observations of polarized and unpolarized standard stars , and the polarizations found for these stars agreed well with previously published values ( @xcite ) .",
    "the zeropoint of the polarization angle was calibrated using the polarized standard stars as references .",
    "observations of unpolarized standard stars ( figure [ null ] ) showed a well - behaved , flat response over the observed wavelength range and an instrumental polarization of @xmath20 .",
    "all measurements of emission - line and continuum polarization were carried out on the @xmath17 and @xmath18 spectra , with the results converted to @xmath19 and @xmath21 ( the position angle of polarization ) only as the final step , following the methods outlined by miller ( 1988 ) . for display purposes ,",
    "the rotated stokes parameter was computed by heavily smoothing the @xmath21 curve and rotating @xmath17 and @xmath18 by this smoothed angle , to yield a single stokes parameter containing essentially all of the measured polarization . as discussed by miller ( 1988 )",
    ", the polarization @xmath19 has a peculiar error distribution which becomes particularly problematic at low , because the usual formula @xmath22 is positive definite .",
    "the rotated stokes parameter is equivalent to the degree of polarization @xmath19 , but its noise properties are better behaved .",
    "the stokes flux spectrum is calculated as the product of total flux and the rotated stokes parameter , and gives the spectrum of the linearly polarized component of the total flux .",
    "the total flux , rotated stokes parameter , and stokes flux spectra for each galaxy are shown in figures [ ngc315plot]-[ngc4594plot ] and the individual galaxies are discussed in  [ sectionindividual ] .",
    "we do not display the @xmath21 spectra , as they are extremely noisy and convey little useful information .    as a check on the error propagation ,",
    "the stokes parameter error spectra can be compared with the actual pixel - to - pixel variations in the stokes parameter spectra . in regions where the stokes parameters appear roughly constant",
    ", we generally find excellent agreement between the propagated uncertanties in @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the standard deviations of pixel values in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 spectra .",
    "however , the quoted uncertainties on @xmath19 reflect only the random errors due to photon - counting statistics and readout noise . at the very weak polarization levels discussed here , systematic uncertainties in the spectral extractions and calibrations",
    "can contribute appreciably to the actual errors , causing faint broad features or undulations to appear in @xmath19 , as seen in some of our spectra .",
    "incompletely removed cosmic - ray hits can also lead to spikes appearing in @xmath19 .",
    "the continuum polarization and @xmath21 over the range 5100 - 6100 are listed for each galaxy in table [ continuumtable ] . as expected , these galaxies have very low polarization , with a median value of @xmath3",
    ". only one object , ngc 3718 , has a continuum polarization greater than 1% , and in this case the polarization is the result of transmission through interstellar dust in the host galaxy ( see  [ section3718 ] ) . only a small amount of internal or galactic dust would be required to produce the low levels of continuum polarization observed in most of these objects . along a given line of sight ,",
    "the maximum level of polarization typically produced by transmission through galactic dust is @xmath23(serkowski , mathewson , & ford 1975 ) .",
    "thus , a continuum polarization of 0.36% could in principle be produced by transmission through a reddening column of only  = 0.04 mag .    in some galaxies in this sample",
    ", @xmath19 rises steadily toward the blue , which could be a signature of scattered agn emission .",
    "if a polarized nonstellar continuum were present , @xmath19 would rise toward the blue end of the spectrum where the nonstellar continuum fraction is greatest .",
    "however , interstellar polarization from galactic dust or from dust in the host galaxy can mimic this effect . as shown by serkowski ( 1975 ) , the wavelength of maximum interstellar polarization ranges from 4500 to 8000   depending on the line of sight .",
    "since our wavelength setting does not extend significantly blueward of 4500  , we are unable to determine whether the @xmath19 spectrum turns over and begins to drop off at shorter wavelengths . future observations over a wider wavelength range could result in detections of scattered agn emission in some of these objects , if @xmath19 continues to rise blueward of 4500  .",
    "since the magnitude of interstellar polarization is comparable to or greater than that expected for the intrinsic polarization , special care must be taken to examine the @xmath17 and @xmath18 spectra for polarization features at .",
    "faint emission - line features in @xmath17 or @xmath18 may not appear in the rotated stokes parameter if they are oriented at a different p.a . from the continuum polarization . also , any emission - line feature at  appearing in stokes flux but not in @xmath19 is most likely a result of interstellar polarization , as it is generated by multiplying the total flux by a nonzero ( but noisy ) quantity .",
    "therefore , only those galaxies having clear emission - line features in @xmath19 , or in the @xmath17 or @xmath18 spectra , are considered to be detections of physically interesting polarization .",
    "ngc 4395 is the only exception to this rule , because its nuclear continuum is predominantly nonstellar ; see  [ section4395 ] below .    to assess the significance level of the emission - line polarizations ,",
    "we tested whether the stokes parameters at  differ from the stokes parameters in the surrounding continuum .",
    "the @xmath17 parameter was measured for the total emission ( line and continuum ) over 6500 - 6625  , a region which covers the + [ ] profile . for the continuum comparison measurement",
    ", a straight line was fitted to the @xmath17 spectrum in the line - free regions 63806480   and 66506700  , and the continuum level of @xmath17 in the  wavelength bin was determined from the best - fitting line .",
    "these default line and continuum wavelength regions were adjusted for a few galaxies with unusually broad  emission ( ngc 1097 , ngc 3998 , and m81 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 gives the significance level , in standard deviations , of the difference between the value of @xmath17 measured in the  bin and the @xmath17 continuum level determined from the fit .",
    "the same procedure was followed for the @xmath18 spectrum , and table [ resultstable ] lists the results for each galaxy .    since the @xmath17 and @xmath18 spectra commonly show spurious bumps and features at the level of @xmath25 with respect to the propagated uncertainties , we conservatively choose to set a detection threshold of @xmath26 to account for these systematic uncertainties .",
    "thus , if @xmath27 or @xmath28 , we interpret the result as a significant detection of emission - line polarization .",
    "the results listed in table [ resultstable ] show that three galaxies in our sample , ngc 315 , ngc 1052 , and ngc 4261 , have significant detections ( @xmath29 ) of emission - line features in one stokes parameter . in the remaining galaxies ,",
    "the polarization of the  bin is well within 4@xmath30 of the continuum polarization , and these results are interpreted as non - detections of emission - line polarization .",
    "inspection of the individual polarization spectra , presented in",
    " [ sectionindividual ] , shows that these quantitative results agree well with visual assessments of detection or non - detection in the data .    for the type 1 objects ,",
    "the broad - line flux in total light was measured by subtracting an absorption - line template spectrum and deblending the + [ ] profile , following the methods described by ho ( 1997c ) .",
    "if broad  was detected in total flux but not in @xmath19 , we determined @xmath26 upper limits to the polarization of the broad component under the assumption that the narrow emission lines are intrinsically unpolarized , but allowing for the possibility that there may be some intrinsic continuum polarization .",
    "the quoted limits on @xmath19 ( ) were calculated by determining the @xmath26 upper limits to the presence of polarization features in @xmath17 and @xmath18 individually .    throughout this paper , all galactic reddening estimates refer to the reddening map of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "this elliptical galaxy hosts a broad - lined liner nucleus ( ho 1997c ) surrounded by a dusty circumnuclear disk ( @xcite ) , and it is the source of a double - sided radio jet ( giovannini 1990 ) .",
    "broad features at  and  are visible in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 spectra , but the polarization angles of the continuum and the emission are misaligned by @xmath31 .",
    "this offset suggests that much of the apparent continuum polarization is due to galactic foreground dust .",
    "ngc 315 lies at @xmath32 behind a galactic reddening of  = 0.065 mag .    to remove the effects of interstellar polarization",
    ", we observed the galactic a2 star bd+30135 during the january 1998 observing run .",
    "the star is located at a projected separation of 13 from ngc 315 , and its apparent magnitude implies a distance of @xmath33 pc , large enough for it to be a good probe of galactic polarization .",
    "the two sight - lines appear to be affected by similar interstellar polarization : over the range 5100 - 6100  , ngc 315 has @xmath34 at @xmath35 , while bd+30135 has @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "the stokes parameter spectra of the star were fitted with low - order polynomials and the resulting fits were subtracted from the stokes parameters of ngc 315 , to yield a corrected set of parameters for the galaxy .",
    "the spectra shown in figure [ ngc315plot ] are the results after subtraction of the interstellar polarization .",
    "the polarization angle of the + [ ] blend is @xmath38 , which is offset by @xmath39 from the radio jet axis measured at vlbi resolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "after correction for interstellar polarization , the continuum over 5100 - 6100   has @xmath40 oriented at @xmath41 , roughly aligned with the emission - line polarization angle .    over the entire + [ ] blend ,",
    "the emission - line polarization is @xmath42 .",
    "starlight subtraction of the total flux spectrum was attempted using several emission - free template spectra , but none could perfectly reproduce the shape of the stellar continuum over the 6000 - 6700   range ; a spectrum of ngc 3115 was chosen as the best template . ho",
    "( 1997c ) used a seven - gaussian decomposition to fit the + [ ] profile in ngc 315 , but due to the lower spectral resolution of our data and an imperfect starlight subtraction , we chose to fit the blend using a simpler quadruple - gaussian model , representing the three narrow components and a broad  line . the fits in total flux and stokes flux",
    "are shown in figure [ ngc315hal ] .",
    "the broad component of  has fwhm = 3200  in stokes flux and 2300  in total flux .",
    "the ratio of the two line strengths gives @xmath43 for broad , but this measurement is very crude as a result of the noisy  profile in polarized light and the uncertain profile decompositions .",
    "results for ngc 1052 have been presented by barth ( 1999a ) .",
    "the wings of the broad  profile are polarized , and the broad line has fwhm @xmath44  in total flux and fwhm @xmath45  in polarized light .",
    "the angle of polarization is offset by 67  from the parsec - scale radio axis and by 83  from the kpc - scale radio axis , roughly in agreement with expectations for the obscuring torus model .",
    "we note that this dataset has significantly higher  than our observations of the other galaxies in this sample , owing to the brightness of this galaxy and the relatively long integration .",
    "the double - peaked broad  line which was first discovered by storchi - bergmann , baldwin , & wilson ( 1993 ) is still visible in our january 1998 and january 1999 data ( figure [ ngc1097plot ] ) .",
    "the displayed spectra are weighted averages of the results from these two observing runs .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations of such double - peaked emitters can provide constraints on accretion disk models for the origin of the broad - line emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the  polarization was evaluated over the wavelength range 66306710  , which includes most of the broad double - peaked feature .",
    "no significant polarization was found , with an upper limit of @xmath46 for the polarization of the broad  emission over this range .",
    "this limit is not stringent enough to constrain accretion disk models , as the simplest disk - emission model predicts a broad - line polarization of @xmath47 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) for a disk inclination of 34 , the orientation which best matches the double - peaked profile ( @xcite ) .      due to cloudy conditions and the faintness of this agn ,",

    "antonucci ( 1993 ) suggested that the broad  emission in m81 might be seen in reflection , as the apparent lack of variability of the broad - line emission prior to 1993 ( @xcite ) could be interpreted as the result of the light - travel time across a spatially extended reflection region .",

    "transmission through foreground dust within the nucleus of ngc 4395 could be responsible for the polarization , but only if the region of aligned dust grains covers the continuum and blr but not the more spatially extended nlr .",
    "electron scattering of the continuum and broad lines is a more likely explanation , and consistent with the relatively flat wavelength dependence of @xmath19 in the continuum .",
    "comparison of @xmath21 with a radio axis would provide clues to the scattering geometry , but the nuclear radio source in ngc 4395 is unresolved ( @xcite )",
    ". a clear sign of electron scattering would be a broadened  profile in stokes flux , but data of higher and greater spectral resolution would be required in order to deblend the + [ ] emission convincingly , because the broad line has a very non - gaussian profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "kormendy ( 1996 ) detected a faint broad component of  with fwzi @xmath69  in _ hst _ spectra .",
    "no broad - line polarization is detected , but the continuum polarization rises gradually toward the blue end of the spectrum ( figure [ ngc4594plot ] ) , from 0.40% over 65006800   to 0.57% over 45005000  .",
    "much of this continuum polarization could be the result of transmission through galactic dust , since the reddening column along this line of sight is  = 0.05 mag .",
    "in understanding the place of liners within agn unified schemes , a question of paramount importance is whether the broad  wings observed in some liners are viewed directly , or in light scattered above the midplane of an obscuring torus . in other words , as antonucci ( 1993 ) has asked , are these liner 1.9 nuclei intrinsically type 1 or type 2 objects ?",
    "one argument , based on the obscuring torus model , can be given as follows .",
    "suppose that the liner 1.9 nuclei are in fact type 2 objects , in which the broad  emission is seen only in scattered light .",
    "if this were the case , then there should be lines of sight from which these galaxies would appear as type 1 objects , and the broad - line emission would appear brighter by perhaps two orders of magnitude or more . thus , unless the torus opening angle is very small in these objects , a significant fraction of liner nuclei should have broad - line equivalent widths of at least 100  , as compared with the typical equivalent widths of a few   observed in liner 1.9 nuclei ( @xcite ) .",
    "but very few such nuclei are known to exist ; in the ho survey of 486 nearby galaxies , not a single liner was found to have a broad - line classification in the 1.01.8 range , under the osterbrock ( 1977 ; 1981 ) classification scheme .",
    "the few known examples of liners with very high equivalent width broad  lines include ngc 7213 ( @xcite ) , the radio galaxy pictor a ( @xcite ) , and the transient double - peaked source in ngc 1097 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that liner 1.01.8 nuclei are so rare provides a strong suggestion that the liner 1.9 nuclei _ are _ those liners in which we have a direct view of the nucleus , and that the broad emission lines in these objects are intrinsically faint .",
    "the undetectably low emission - line polarizations observed in most liner 1.9 nuclei are consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "if this line of reasoning is correct , then the liner 1.9 nuclei ngc 315 and ngc 1052 , in which polarized broad  is detected , may be cases in which the blr is viewed both directly and in reflected light .",
    "this explanation can also account for the low polarizations of the broad  lines in these galaxies , in comparison with the much higher broad - line polarizations of 1535% measured in some seyfert 2 nuclei ( @xcite ) .",
    "scattering within the opening cone of ( or above the plane of ) an obscuring torus provides a consistent explanation for the emission - line polarization observed in ngc 315 , ngc 1052 , and ngc 4261 , since the angle of polarization in each case is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the radio jet .",
    "the nuclear dust disks seen in _ hst _ images of ngc 4261 ( @xcite ) and ngc 315 ( @xcite ) provide supporting evidence for this interpretation , as these disks are likely to be the outer extensions of the obscuring tori .",
    "the nuclear morphology of ngc 1052 has yet to be studied with _",
    "hst _ data , but we note that ground - based observations have detected rotating disks of ionized ( @xcite ) and neutral ( @xcite ) gas on kiloparsec scales which could be connected with a dusty torus and/or accretion disk on smaller scales .",
    "the scattering material may consist of either dust particles or electrons , and it is difficult to distinguish between these possibilities with the limited information contained in our data . in ngc 1052 , the broad  emission is considerably broader in polarized light than in total light ( 5000  vs. 2000 ) , and this difference can be interpreted as the result of electron scattering by a @xmath70 k scattering medium , if the blr is viewed partially in direct light as well as in scattered light",
    ". in general , the best way to discriminate between dust and electron scattering is to obtain spectropolarimetric observations in the ultraviolet , where a @xmath19 spectrum rising to the blue would be a clear indicator of dust scattering rather than wavelength - independent thomson scattering .",
    "ultraviolet spectropolarimetry would also alleviate the problem of contamination by the surrounding old stellar population .",
    "one curious result of this survey is that polarized emission lines have been detected in all three of the ellipticals that were observed , but in none of the spirals .",
    "while it is true that our sample was not selected in a statistically meaningful way , this dichotomy between ellipticals and spirals is certainly intriguing , and should be investigated further with a larger , carefully selected sample of llagns .",
    "it will probably be very difficult to detect polarized broad - line emission from liner 2 nuclei in spiral hosts , however , since these nuclei tend to be very dusty ( @xcite ) and the emission - line equivalent widths tend to be low",
    ". it may be easier to detect hidden blrs in elliptical liners simply because these objects are less likely to be obscured by foreground dust lanes .",
    "heisler ( 1997 ) have shown that seyfert 2 nuclei with hidden blrs have systematically warmer far - infrared colors , as measured by the  @xmath71 flux ratio , than do seyfert 2 galaxies without hidden blrs .",
    "they interpret this trend as the result of viewing angle : in their model , galaxies in which hidden blrs are detected are those where our line of sight grazes the inner edge of the torus , and we view directly the hot dust in the inner torus . determining whether the infrared colors of liners follow this trend as well would require infrared data of higher spatial resolution , since the  beamsize includes much of the host galaxy as well as the faint nuclear emission .",
    "it is interesting that the two galaxies in our sample with the warmest  colors are ngc 1052 and ngc 4261 , with @xmath72 = 0.57 and 1.00 , respectively , although the measurement for ngc 4261 carries an 86% uncertainty ( using the results tabulated by @xcite ) . for the full sample of 14 galaxies observed in this survey ,",
    "the mean @xmath72 color is 0.27 .",
    "ngc 315 was not detected at 25 , resulting in an upper limit of @xmath73 .    the question of whether _ all _ seyfert 2 galaxies contain hidden type 1 nuclei has been difficult to address partly because of the starlight contamination problem . among seyfert 2",
    "nuclei , there is a strong tendency for hidden blrs to be detected preferentially in objects where the contamination by unpolarized starlight is low ( @xcite ) .",
    "most seyfert 2 galaxies known to have hidden blrs have galaxy fractions of @xmath74 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath75 is the fraction of the optical continuum flux contributed by starlight .",
    "our results indicate that some liners , in which @xmath76 , contain polarized broad - line emission which is detected at the level of only a few tenths of a percent in @xmath19 above the level of the surrounding continuum .",
    "many seyfert 2 nuclei with hidden blrs have probably been missed in previous surveys , which may not have been able to detect such faint polarization features . to alleviate the starlight problem",
    ", it would be useful to conduct a spectropolarimetric survey of seyfert 2 nuclei at  comparable to those we have reached in this work , with a sample which is not biased toward objects of high polarization . as shown by kay & moran ( 1998 ) , detection of hidden blrs in starlight - dominated seyfert 2 nuclei could provide important constraints on the applicability of the obscuring torus model to the seyfert population as a whole .",
    "our primary conclusion is that polarized broad - line emission is seen in some nearby galaxies classified as liners , indicating that unified models of agns apply to at least some members of this class .",
    "most galaxies we observed do not show emission - line polarization , however .",
    "a likely explanation is that most liners in which broad  wings are detected in total flux are intrinsically `` type 1 '' objects in which we view the central regions of the agn directly .",
    "objects classified as `` type 2 '' liners may have hidden blrs , as in ngc 4261 , and further observations should be able to detect more objects of this type and to constrain the fraction of liner 2s having hidden blrs .",
    "the objects in which we have detected polarized broad  are all elliptical galaxies with double - sided radio jets , and these may be interpreted as low - luminosity versions of more powerful narrow - line radio galaxies , some of which are known to host hidden quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "polarized broad - line emission was not detected in any liners in spiral hosts . as liner 2",
    "nuclei may be the most common manifestation of the agn phenomenon , further searches for hidden blrs in these objects can play an important role in determining the fraction of galaxies in which accretion - powered nuclear activity occurs .",
