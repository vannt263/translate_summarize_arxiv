    "one of the definitions of integrability of discrete equations , which becomes increasingly popular in the recent years , is based on the notion of multidimensional consistency . for two - dimensional systems ,",
    "this notion was clearly formulated first in @xcite , and it was pushed forward as a synonym of integrability in @xcite .",
    "the outstanding importance of 3d consistency in the theory of discrete integrable systems became evident no later than with the appearance of the well - known abs - classification of integrable equations in @xcite .",
    "this classification deals with quad - equations which are set on the faces of an elementary cube in such a manner that all faces carry similar equations differing only by the parameter values assigned to the edges of a cube .",
    "moreover , each single equation admits a @xmath1 symmetry group .",
    "thus , abs - equations from @xcite can be extended in a straightforward manner to the whole of @xmath2 . in @xcite , a relaxed definition of 3d consistency",
    "was introduced : the faces of an elementary cube are allowed to carry a priori different quad - equations .",
    "the classification performed in @xcite is restricted to so - called equations of type  q , i.e. , those equations whose biquadratics are all non - degenerate ( a precise definition will be recalled in section [ faces ] ) . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "numerous asymmetric systems of quad - equations have been studied , which also include equations of type h ( with degenerate biquadratics ) .",
    "a classification of such systems has been given in @xcite .",
    "this classification covers the majority of systems from @xcite and all systems from @xcite , as well as equations from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , it contains also a number of novel systems . the results of this local classification lead to integrable lattice systems via a procedure of reflecting the cubes in a suitable way ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the asymmetric systems still can be seen as families of bcklund transformations , and they lead to zero curvature representations of participating quad - equations .    after the pioneering work @xcite the variational ( lagrangian ) structure of discrete integrable systems is a topic which receives more and more attention .",
    "a lagrangian formulation of systems from the abs list is given in @xcite .",
    "the new idea in @xcite was to extend the action functional of @xcite to a multidimensional lattice , which is meaningful due to the invariance of the action under elementary 3d flips of 2d quad - surfaces in @xmath2 .",
    "this remarkable and fundamental flip invariance property was proven in @xcite for some particular cases from the abs list and in @xcite for the whole list .    in the present paper , we introduce a lagrangian formulation for an important subclass of systems from the classification in @xcite , namely those which include type h equations not all of whose biquadratics are degenerate , and prove the flip invariance of action functionals for these systems .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sections  [ faces ] and [ cubes ] we introduce the necessary notions and notation and recapitulate the classification results from @xcite which are relevant for the present paper .",
    "then , in section  [ threelegforms ] we use the so - called three - leg form of quad - equations to construct the lagrangians for our equations .",
    "the fundamental property of lagrangians on an elementary quadrilateral constitutes one of the main results of the paper ( theorem [ th : single ] ) .",
    "the lagrangians are elementary building blocks of the action functional constructed in section  [ flipquad ] , which also contains the second main result of the paper , namely the flip invariance of the action functional for systems of our class .",
    "we start with introducing relevant objects and notations . a _",
    "quad - equation _ is a relation of the type @xmath3 , where @xmath4 $ ] is an irreducible multi - affine polynomial .",
    "it is convenient to visualize a quad - equation by an elementary square whose vertices carry the four fields @xmath5 , cf . figure  [ fig:2 ] . for quad - equations without pre - supposed symmetries , the natural classification problem is posed modulo the action of four independent mbius transformations of all four variables : @xmath6 in the simplest situation , a quad - equation is thought of as an elementary building block of a discrete system @xmath7 for a function @xmath8 , but we will also encounter more tricky ways of composing discrete systems on @xmath9 from different quad - equations .    a very useful tool for studying and classifying quad - equations , or , better , multi - affine polynomials of four variables , are their _ biquadratics_. for any two ( different )",
    "indices @xmath10 , we define the corresponding biquadratic as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the complement of @xmath13 in @xmath14 . a biquadratic polynomial @xmath15 is called _ non - degenerate _ if no polynomial in its equivalence class with respect to mbius transformations in @xmath16 and @xmath17 is divisible by a factor @xmath18 or @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) .",
    "otherwise , @xmath21 is called _",
    "degenerate_. here , of course , the action of two mbius transformations on @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 we recall also that an important role in studying the multi - affine polynomials @xmath23 belongs to the four discriminants @xmath24 ( it can be shown that the result does not depend on @xmath25 ) .",
    "these are quartic polynomials which can be assigned to the vertices of an elementary square .",
    "note that the action of a mbius transformation on a quartic polynomial @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27    a multi - affine polynomial @xmath23 is said to be of _ type  q _",
    "if all its biquadratics are non - degenerate and of _ type  h _ otherwise .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that in the latter case either four out of six biquadratics are degenerate , and then @xmath23 is said to be of _ type  h^4^ _ , or all six biquadratics are degenerate , and then @xmath23 is said to be of _ type  h^6^_.    a complete classification of multi - affine polynomials @xmath23 up to mbius transformations in @xmath28 is given in @xcite . in the present paper , we will be only interested in 3d consistent six - tuples of quad - equations containing at least one equation of type  h^4^  but no equations of type  h^6^. ( recall that six - tuples consisting solely of type  q equations were already classified in @xcite , and the flip invariance of the action functional for such systems was completely discussed in @xcite . ) as shown in @xcite , the list of canonical normal forms of polynomials of type  h^4^  consists of three items ( which actually appeared already in @xcite ) :    * @xmath29 , * @xmath30 + @xmath31 , * @xmath32 .    thus , the members of this list , like those of the list q , depend on two parameters @xmath33 which can be assigned to the pairs of opposite edges of the elementary square .",
    "however , unlike the q case , where all vertices are on the equal footing ( which can be visualized as on figure [ fig:3 ] ) , for any type h^4^  polynomial , the four discriminants assigned to the vertices belong to two different types ( at least for @xmath34 ) . up to constant factors @xmath35 depending on the parameters only and listed in section [ typeh ] ( cf . also lemma [ lem:1param ] ) ,",
    "one has :    * @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ; * @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ; * @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to the coloring of the vertices in two black and two white ones .",
    "we will think of the black vertices as carrying the parameter @xmath48 , while for the white vertices @xmath49 .",
    "it will be useful to visually keep track of the distribution of the four degenerate and two non - degenerate biquadratics of a type h^4^  polynomial .",
    "we will indicate the two non - degenerate ones by thick lines .",
    "when composing discrete systems from quad - equations , it becomes crucial how to arrange the variables ( fields ) @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 over the vertices of an elementary square .",
    "there are two different ( up to rotations of an elementary square ) quad - equations of type  h^4^ , corresponding to two different _ biquadratics patterns _ , as shown on figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the first arrangement corresponds to assigning the two black vertices to one diagonal of the elementary square and the two white vertices to another diagonal , see figure [ fig:2a ] .",
    "we will call these quad - equations the _ rhombic version of @xmath54 _ , due to the symmetry properties @xmath55 of the corresponding polynomials .",
    "the second version of a quad - equation is obtained from the canonical normal form @xmath54 by the switching @xmath56 and @xmath57 . as a consequence ,",
    "the two black vertices share an edge rather than a diagonal , and the same holds true for the two white vertices .",
    "this version of a quad - equation possesses only one axis symmetry which interchanges the vertices of the same color ( see figure [ fig:2b ] ) .",
    "we will call the corresponding quad - equations the _ trapezoidal version of @xmath54_.    by the way , the biquadratics pattern provides us with an unambiguous way of bi - coloring the vertices of the square even in the case @xmath49 , when all four discriminants are the same ( this corresponds to the list h from @xcite ) : each of the two thick lines corresponding to the two non - degenerate biquadratics connects two vertices of the same color .",
    "concerning discrete systems composed of quad - equations , we mention that the rhombic version of any equation @xmath54 can be imposed on any bipartite quad - graph ( cf . also @xcite ) . as for the trapezoidal version of @xmath54",
    ", it can be imposed on the regular square lattice @xmath9 with horizontal ( or vertical ) rows colored alternately black and white , see figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "integrability of such a non - autonomous system of quad - equations understood as 3d consistency has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "consisting of quad - equations @xmath54 ]",
    "we will now consider six - tuples of ( a priori different ) quad - equations assigned to the faces of a 3d cube : @xmath59 see figure  [ fig : cube ] .",
    "such a six - tuple is _",
    "3d consistent _ if , for arbitrary initial data @xmath16 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the three values for @xmath60 ( calculated by using @xmath61 , @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) coincide .",
    "a 3d consistent six - tuple is said to possess the _",
    "tetrahedron property _ if there exist two polynomials @xmath64 and @xmath65 such that the equations @xmath66 are satisfied for every solution of the six - tuple .",
    "it can be shown that the polynomials @xmath64 and @xmath65 are multi - affine and irreducible ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a complete classification of 3d consistent six - tuples   possessing the tetrahedron property , modulo ( possibly different ) mbius transformations of the eight fields @xmath16 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath60 , is given in @xcite .",
    "we mention one of the important general properties of such six - tuples :    [ lem : opposite ] equations on opposite faces are of the same type and have the same biquadratics pattern .    in the present article , we consider only six - tuples   whose equations are not all of type  q and which do not contain type  h^6^  equations .",
    "taking into account lemma [ lem : opposite ] , one easily sees that three different combinatorial arrangements of biquadratics patterns are possible , as indicated on figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "arrangements on figures  [ fig:5a ] and [ fig:5b ] are related to each other by the following construction , see @xcite for a proof :    [ tetrahedronuse ] consider a 3d consistent six - tuple   possessing the tetrahedron property expressed by the two equations @xmath69 then the six - tuple @xmath70 assigned to the faces of a 3d cube as on figure  [ fig : cube2 ] , is 3d consistent and possesses the tetrahedron property expressed by the two equations @xmath71 3d consistency of is understood as the property of the initial value problem with the initial date @xmath16 , @xmath52 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "now we can formulate the main result of @xcite concerning 3d consistent six - tuples containing equations of type h^4^   but no equations of type h^6^. in this theorem , we use normal forms @xmath74 of equations of the list q which are slightly different from those adopted in @xcite , namely    * @xmath75 + @xmath76 , * @xmath77 + @xmath78 , * @xmath79 + @xmath80 .",
    "[ th : class ] modulo independent mbius transformations of all fields , there are nine 3d consistent six - tuples of quad - equations with the tetrahedron property which contain equations of type h^4^   but no equations of type h^6^ :    * three systems with the biquadratics pattern as on figure [ fig:5a ] , with all six face equations being rhombic @xmath54 , and the tetrahedron equations @xmath74 ( for @xmath81 ) . * three systems with the biquadratics pattern as on figure [ fig:5b ] , with two pairs of face equations being trapezoidal @xmath54 , one pair of face equations @xmath74 , and the tetrahedron equations @xmath54 ( for @xmath81 ) . * three systems with the biquadratics pattern as on figure [ fig:5c ] , with two pairs of face equations being trapezoidal @xmath54 , the third pair of face equations being rhombic @xmath54 , and both tetrahedron equations @xmath54 ( for @xmath81 ) .",
    "all these six - tuples can be embedded into the lattice @xmath82 by reflecting the cubes , see details of this construction in @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian formulation of these systems continued to the whole lattice constitutes the main subject of the present paper .",
    "as already demonstrated in @xcite , the lagrangian structures of quad - equations are closely related to their three - leg forms , which , in turn , can be derived from the biquadratics related to the quad - equations .",
    "[ lem:1param ] for any of the polynomials @xmath74 , @xmath54 @xmath83 there exits a re - scaling of the function @xmath23 such that the re - scaled biquadratics depend only on one parameter , namely the parameter assigned to the corresponding edge : @xmath84    the proof consists of a direct verification with the scaling factors given in sections [ typeq ] , [ typeh ] . in particular , for the polynomials @xmath74 , due to their high symmetry , all three biquadratics are given essentially by one and the same non - degenerate symmetric polynomial @xmath85 : @xmath86 for the polynomials @xmath54 , one still has @xmath87 where the biquadratic polynomial @xmath88 is degenerate and non - symmetric .",
    "the signs on the right - hand sides of the latter equations are responsible for the choice of signs in the three - leg form of quad - equations :    [ three - legs ] equations @xmath89 and rhombic equations @xmath90 possess three - leg forms @xmath91 and @xmath92 centered at @xmath93 and at @xmath94 , respectively , with the functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 listed in sections  [ typeq ] , [ typeh ] . for equations",
    "@xmath74 , one has @xmath97 .",
    "if @xmath98 denotes the uniformizing changes of variables for @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the discriminant corresponding to the vertex @xmath101 , then the leg functions satisfy the following relations : @xmath102 and @xmath103 in addition , we have the following properties :    * symmetry : @xmath104 * derivative with respect to the parameter : @xmath105    similar statements for equations of the abs list were already given in @xcite .",
    "here we provide the reader with slightly more explanations why these statements hold true .",
    "namely , the first statement follows from the result ( due to v. adler and published as exercise 6.16 in @xcite ) that the three - leg form of an arbitrary multi - affine equation @xmath106 , centered at @xmath93 , reads @xmath107 due to lemma [ lem:1param ] , for equations @xmath54 , @xmath74 one can replace here @xmath108 by the biquadratics @xmath109 depending on one parameter each . furthermore , all three leg functions in the latter formula can be simultaneously multiplied by an arbitrary function of @xmath93 . the choice of this function as @xmath110 ensures the symmetry properties of the derivative of the leg function with respect to the second argument : @xmath111 the both diagonal biquadratics are symmetric but different , so that one has two different long leg functions @xmath112 and @xmath96 .",
    "the formulas for the derivatives of the leg functions with respect to parameters are checked by a direct computation .    for trapezoidal equations @xmath54 ,",
    "the notion of short and long legs might be somewhat misleading .",
    "we will assume that , for both the rhombic and the trapezoidal versions of @xmath54 , the functions @xmath112 and @xmath96 correspond to two non - degenerate biquadratics ( black and white , respectively ) , while the functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 correspond to four degenerate biquadratics , with the first argument ( the center point of the three - leg form ) being black , resp .",
    "thus , the three - leg forms of a trapezoidal equation @xmath54 , as depicted on figure [ fig:2b ] , read : @xmath115 ( centered at a black vertex @xmath93 ) , resp .",
    "@xmath116 ( centered at a white vertex @xmath117 ) .",
    "we recall that the three - leg forms of quad - equations yield the so called laplace type equations of the stars of the vertices of the underlying quad - graph .",
    "these laplace type equations say that the sum of long - leg functions for diagonals of all quadrilaterals adjacent to a vertex is equal to zero . for the rhombic equations @xmath54 , the long - leg functions @xmath118 are the same as for the type q equations , so that they do not lead to new laplace type equations . for the trapezoidal equations @xmath54 , the long - leg functions are @xmath119 , so that one arrives at novel laplace type equations .",
    "for instance , the laplace type equations at the vertices @xmath117 ( black ) and @xmath120 ( white ) on figure  [ fig:8 ] read :     system of trapezoidal equations @xmath54 ]    @xmath121 resp .",
    "we are now in a position to construct functions which will play the role of lagrangians in the action functionals for system of quad - equations .",
    "[ lagr ] for equations @xmath89 , @xmath90 , there exist functions @xmath123 ( defined on directed edges starting at a black vertex and ending at a white vertex ) , @xmath124 ( defined on edges connecting two black vertices ) , and @xmath125 ( defined on edges connecting two white vertices ) such that , upon changes of variables @xmath126 introduced in lemma [ three - legs ] , there hold the following relations : @xmath127 these functions ( defined up to arbitrary additive functions of the respective parameters ) can be chosen so that @xmath128    the main theorem concerning the lagrangians for a single quad - equation , which serves as the major ingredient of the proof of the flip invariance of the action functionals , reads :    [ th : single ] for equations @xmath129 , the lagrangians @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 can be chosen so that the following relation holds on solutions of the equation @xmath133 :    \\a ) rhombic case with the enumeration of fields as on figure  [ fig:2a ] : @xmath134    \\b ) trapezoidal case with the enumeration of fields as on figure  [ fig:2b ] : @xmath135    for equations @xmath74 , the analogous statement holds true if one sets all lagrangians @xmath136 , and @xmath137 equal ( to @xmath131 , say ) .",
    "the proof of this theorem is completely analogous to the one of theorem  1 in @xcite and is obtained by showing that the gradient of the function on the left - hand side vanishes on the solutions of @xmath106 due to the equivalence of the equation @xmath106 to its three - leg forms .",
    "it is important to notice that in a 3d consistent six - tuple of quad - equations possessing the tetrahedron property , the choice of lagrangians of every quad - equation ( be it the face equation or the tetrahedron equation ) can be made in a consistent manner , i.e. , on every edge ( or diagonal ) the two lagrangians coming from the two different equations of the quadrilaterals sharing this edge coincide .",
    "this follows from the next result which was given for equations of the abs list in @xcite , and was proven in full generality in @xcite ) :    [ biquads ] consider a 3d consistent six - tuple   of quad - equations possessing the tetrahedron property . then :    1 .   for",
    "any edge of the cube , the two biquadratics corresponding to this edge coincide up to a constant factor ; for example @xmath138 2 .",
    "the product of these factors around one vertex is equal to @xmath139 ; for example , for the vertex @xmath16 one has : @xmath140 one can choose the normalization of the polynomials @xmath141 so that all such factors ( for all 12 edges of the cube ) are equal to @xmath139 .    as a consequence of this result , for consistent systems of quad - equations , each edge @xmath0 carries a well defined leg function and a well defined lagrangian , in the sense that these objects do not depend on the elementary square of @xmath0 adjacent to this edge .",
    "moreover , due to the construction of lemma [ tetrahedronuse ] , the same is true for diagonals of elementary squares of @xmath0 , which support leg functions and lagrangians coming alternatively from edges of black and white tetrahedra supporting their own quad - equations .",
    "following the main idea of @xcite , we consider the functional for a multidimensionally consistent system of quad - equations defined on any quad - surfaces @xmath142 in the @xmath0 by the formula @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the value of a discrete lagrangian two - form on an elementary ( oriented ) square @xmath145 , @xmath146 for equations @xmath54 and @xmath74 defined on black - and - white ( but not necessarily bipartite ) quad - graphs , one can encounter eight types of elementary squares depicted on figure  [ fig:9 ] .",
    "+   +    the corresponding values of the discrete two - form are : @xmath147 the choice of the sign of the third term in the expressions ( c)(f ) is dictated by the requirement that the two terms with the lagrangian @xmath130 have opposite signs .    with these definitions ,",
    "one has the value of the action functional on any quad - surface in @xmath0 , including @xmath9 . in the latter case",
    "the action can be represented as the sum of lagrangians over all edges of @xmath9 and over all diagonals running from north - west to south - east ( or in the opposite direction , since they could be directed ) .",
    "the term `` action functional '' is justified by the following statement .",
    "[ quad1 ] for any equation @xmath54 ( rhombic or trapezoidal ) or @xmath74 on the regular square lattice @xmath148 , the solutions are critical points of the action functional .",
    "our main result reads as follows :    for any 3d consistent system consisting of quad - equations @xmath54 and/or @xmath74 ( listed in theorem [ th : class ] ) , the action functional is flip - invariant in the sense that the following relation is satisfied on solutions : @xmath149 here @xmath150 denotes the difference operator that acts on vertex functions according to @xmath151    we give the proof which generalizes the first proof of the corresponding result for equations from the abs list given in @xcite .",
