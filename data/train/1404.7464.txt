    "zero group velocity ( zgv ) modes were observed experimentally with various techniques : air - coupled transducers,@xcite impact echo method,@xcite laser ultrasonics.@xcite these experiments demonstrate that the local vibration spectrum of a free plate is dominated by the resonance at the minimum frequency of the @xmath22 lamb mode .",

    "however , it was observed that some thickness resonances ( infinite wavelength ) are also detected when the signal to noise ratio is sufficiently high . for example , fig .  [ zgvthspectredispersion1 ] displays the resonance spectrum measured at the source point ( source spot 2.5 mm ) , on a 1 mm - thick duralumin plate .",
