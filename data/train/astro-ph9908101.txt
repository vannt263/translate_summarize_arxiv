    "we show that a kerr black hole can flare quasi - periodically , if it is connected to the accretion disk by a magnetic field .",
    "the averaged luminosity in the flares is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the magnetic field at the event horizon , @xmath2 is the event horizon radius , @xmath3 is the speed of light .",
    "the mechanism considered here is different from the blandford - znajek process - the magnetic field connects the hole to the accretion disk , instead of to infinity . in ",
    "2 we give the astrophysical formulation of the problem and an order - of - magnitude solution . in ",
    "3 we idealize the problem and solve it rigorously .",
    "1 . shows a kerr black hole , its accretion disk , and a magnetic spot in the disk .",
    "the hole will twist the magnetic field lines , that is a toroidal magnetic field will be generated . to calculate the toroidal field",
    ", we treat the hole as a rotating conducting ball , radius @xmath4 , conductivity @xmath5 ( znajek 1978 ) .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the ball is rotating at about the speed of light , corresponding to a nearly maximally rotating black hole . in the ball rest frame ,",
    "the poloidal electric field is @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is the magnetic field .",
    "the current is @xmath7 .",
    "this current creates a toroidal magnetic field , @xmath8 .",
    "the twisted magnetic field will try to unwind itself . according to the kruskal - shafranov criterion ( kadomtsev 1966 )",
    ", this leads to the screw instability when the toroidal field becomes so strong that the magnetic field line turns around itself about once .",
    "the instability condition is @xmath9 , or @xmath10 , where l is the distance from the event horizon to the magnetic spot measured along the field line .",
    "if the stationary magnetic configuration is screw - unstable , the black hole magnetosphere flares and releases part of the magnetic energy . then the hole twists the magnetic field again , and the magnetosphere becomes screw - unstable .",
    "the flares repeat quasi - periodically , with the period @xmath11 .",
    "we straighten the field lines connecting the hole and the magnetic spot in the disk .",
    "we neglect the motion of the spot as compared to the hole rotation .",
    "this transforms fig.1 into fig.2 .",
    "consider a kerr black hole and two ideally conducting plates at a distance @xmath12 from the hole .",
    "the plates are perpendicular to the black hole angular momentum .",
    "there is a uniform external magnetic field @xmath13 frozen into the plates . the electromagnetic field is force - free .",
    "we calculate the force - free magnetosphere in  3.1 , formulate the stability problem in  3.2 , and show that the magnetosphere can be screw - unstable in  3.3 .",
    "the results given here constitute a rigorous proof that the magnetosphere of a kerr black hole is screw - unstable for certain values of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the angular momentum of the hole per unit mass .",
    "in fact , this means that a fast , @xmath16 , kerr hole will flare if @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a dimensionless number of order unity .",
    "we derive the equation for the force - free magnetosphere following the steps similar to blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) . in our case",
    "the equations and their derivation are much simpler because the electrostatic potential is everywhere zero due the ideally - conducting plates .",
    "the boyer - lindquist coordinates are used , with @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the metric is @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 is the mass , @xmath15 is the angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "the event horizon radius is @xmath25 .",
    "the magnetosphere is described by the maxwell equations @xmath26 and the force - free condition @xmath27 here @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the electromagnetic field tensor , @xmath30 is the four - potential , @xmath31 is the four - current .",
    "we consider the stationary axisymmetric case , @xmath32 .    from ( 5 ) ,",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 then @xmath35 must be a function of @xmath36 . at the plates @xmath37 .",
    "assuming that all the points in the magnetosphere are connected to the conducting plates by the magnetic field lines , @xmath37 everywhere",
    ".    denote @xmath38 , @xmath39",
    ". then the remaining two force - free conditions and three of the maxwell equations are @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 the combination @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the poloidal current . from ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , @xmath47 from ( 7 ) and ( 13 ) , @xmath48 - the current flows along the field lines . from ( 10 ) , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 . now from ( 9 ) , @xmath51    with @xmath52 given by ( 14 ) , @xmath53 by ( 10 ) , and @xmath54 by ( 11 ) , equations ( 7)-(11 ) are satisfied .",
    "equation ( 12 ) takes the final form @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the boundary conditions at the plates are @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the boundary condition at the event horizon follows from the requirement that @xmath60 be finite at @xmath2 .",
    "this gives @xmath61 we now solve ( 15 ) assuming @xmath62 .",
    "for @xmath63 , ( 17 ) gives @xmath64 , and then ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) give @xmath65 .",
    "we use this @xmath66 in ( 17 ) and find the poloidal current , @xmath67 we can now use this @xmath68 in ( 15 ) and iterate if greater precision is required .",
    "but we do not need a more accurate solution for our current purpose .",
    "equation ( 18 ) is sufficiently accurate to analyze the stability of the magnetosphere in the limit of @xmath69 .",
    "we have found the stationary magnetic configuration .",
    "now we study its stability in the framework of force - free electrodynamics ( ffe ) defined by ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) . for @xmath70 , we can use the galilean metric .",
    "ffe is classical electrodynamics supplemented by the force - free condition .",
    "thus @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 is the initial condition .",
    "the speed of light is @xmath19 ; @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the charge and current densities multiplied by @xmath77 .",
    "the electric field is everywhere perpendicular to the magnetic field , @xmath78 .",
    ", @xmath78 follows from ( 21 ) , if @xmath79 , this condition is an independent basic equation of ffe . ]",
    "the electric field component parallel to the magnetic field should vanish because the charges are freely available in ffe .",
    "it is also assumed that the electric field is everywhere weaker than the magnetic field , @xmath80 .",
    "then equation ( 21 ) means that it is always possible to find a local reference frame where the field is a pure magnetic field , and the current is flowing along this field .",
    "ffe is lorentz invariant .",
    "equation ( 21 ) can be written in the form of the non - linear ohm s law @xmath81 equations ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) , ( 22 ) form an evolutionary system ( initial conditions @xmath74 and @xmath78 are implied ) .",
    "it therefore makes sense to study stability of equilibrium electromagnetic fields in ffe .",
    "one can also study linear waves and their nonlinear interactions in the framework of ffe ( thompson & blaes 1998 ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a formulation of ffe similar to magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) ; then we can use the familiar techniques of mhd to test stability of magnetic configurations . to this end , define a field @xmath82 , which is similar to velocity in mhd . then @xmath83 and equation ( 19 ) becomes the `` frozen - in '' law @xmath84 from @xmath82 , and from equations ( 19)-(21 ) , one obtains the momentum equation @xmath85 where @xmath83 .",
    "equations ( 23 ) , ( 24 ) are the usual mhd equations except that the density is equal @xmath86 and there are order @xmath87 corrections in the momentum equation .",
    "a force - free magnetic field ( @xmath88 ) with a zero electric field is a stationary ffe solution .",
    "we will study the stability of the force - free magnetic configurations using the mhd formulation of ffe .",
    "linear perturbations , denoted @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 , satisfy @xmath92 @xmath93 define the displacement by @xmath94 . from ( 25 ) , @xmath95 .",
    "now equation ( 26 ) can be written as @xmath96    since the operator @xmath97 is self - adjoint ( kadomtsev 1966 and references therein ) , the frequency is given by the variational principle @xmath98 the equilibrium field @xmath99 is unstable if the potential energy @xmath100 is negative for some displacements .",
    "consider the case of cylindrical symmetry , coordinates @xmath101 .",
    "the equilibrium field @xmath102 should satisfy @xmath103 , where the prime denotes the r - derivative . for an eigenmode @xmath104 , the potential energy reduces to ( kadomtsev 1966 ) @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the radial component of the displacement .",
    "the other two components of the displacement vector , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , were chosen to minimize the energy for a given @xmath106 .",
    "the functions of radius @xmath109 and @xmath110 are given by @xmath111 @xmath112    we now show that magnetic configurations with a non - zero toroidal field @xmath113 are screw unstable .",
    "screw means , e. g. , that @xmath114 , but not @xmath115 , is unstable for a given sign of @xmath116 .",
    "kadomtsev ( 1966 ) gives a clear discussion of the screw instability in plasmas , and shows that the screw mode is the most dangerous mode ( if the plasma is unstable , it is screw unstable ) .",
    "assume that @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 for @xmath120 , and @xmath113 is positive in between .",
    "assume that @xmath1 is everywhere positive .",
    "let @xmath116 be positive and small .",
    "take @xmath115 .",
    "let @xmath121 be the first zero of @xmath122 .",
    "take a trial function @xmath123 for @xmath124 , and zero at @xmath125 .",
    "we can chose this generalized function @xmath106 in such a way that the first term in the energy integral ( 31 ) vanishes .",
    "the second term is an integral of @xmath110 from @xmath126 to @xmath121 . for small @xmath116",
    ", @xmath127 is negative .",
    "thus an eigenmode @xmath128 is screw - unstable if @xmath129 .",
    "if the length of the magnetosphere in the z - direction is @xmath12 , the minimal value of @xmath116 is @xmath130 .",
    "the instability condition ( the kruskal - shafranov criterion ) is @xmath131 where @xmath18 is a dimensionless number of order unity .",
    "the value of @xmath18 depends on the boundary conditions .      for the black hole magnetosphere , in the limit @xmath69 , at a distance from the hole @xmath132 , the poloidal field",
    "@xmath1 is approximately constant and equal to @xmath13 .",
    "the poloidal current is given by ( 18 ) , and the toroidal field is @xmath133 in the cylindrical coordinates of  3.2 . according to the kruskal - shafranov criterion , the magnetosphere will be screw unstable if @xmath134 , where @xmath18 is a dimensionless number of order unity .",
    "the flaring is a new mechanism for the extraction of the rotational energy of kerr holes .",
    "many previous studies considered the blandford - znajek mechanism in which the magnetic field connects the event horizon to infinity . by contracts ,",
    "the flaring occurs when the magnetic field ends in the accretion disk .",
    "both mechanisms give the same averaged luminosity , as expected from dimensional analysis .",
    "the essential feature of our mechanism is that the rotational frequency of the hole determines the time structure of the radiated energy .",
    "the hole frequency may appear observationally as a quasi - periodicity of the x - ray flux .",
    "it would be interesting to search for this periodicity in the high - time - resolution data ."
