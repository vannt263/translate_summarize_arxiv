    "given the proximity of ngc1068 ( 14.4 mpc and corresponding scale of 70 pc per @xmath4 ) and the predicted size of the molecular torus in an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) from 1 to 100 pc , any trace or signature of a molecular torus in ngc1068 must be searched from data collected under sub - arcsec image quality .",
    "several recent discoveries point towards the presence of a conspicuous and structured molecular / dusty environment around the central engine of ngc1068 ( e.g. gallimore et al 1997 , rouan et al 1998 , marco & alloin 2000 , schinnerer et al 2000 , and references given in these papers ) .",
    "one piece of information still missing to ascertain the existence of a rotating torus in addition to other possible molecular components , is the kinematical status of the molecular / dusty material .",
    "such information is available for the cold molecular gas , from recent interferometric work in the co(21 ) line ( schinnerer et al 2000 ) : the authors infer the presence of a warped disc of cold molecular gas . in this study",
    "we have chosen to probe the molecular gas through the h@xmath1 1 - 0 s(1 ) line ( rest @xmath5 ) .",
    "being related to the hot molecular gas and having specific excitation mechanisms , it provides complementary information to that derived from the co transition which traces the cold molecular gas .",
    "after the pioneering discovery of the h@xmath1 2.12 @xmath6 line emission in ngc1068 by thompson et al ( 1978 ) , a first attempt to image the agn of ngc1068 in the h@xmath1 2.12 @xmath6 line has been reported by rotaciuc et al ( 1991 ) , covering a @xmath7 region at a resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "it is imperative to push further the spatial resolution .",
    "adaptive optics high resolution k , l and m band images of the agn have unveiled the presence and structure of hot to warm dust ( rouan et al 1998 , marco & alloin 2000 ) within the @xmath9 region around the central engine .",
    "we have selected from these observations two particular directions for our kinematical study : ( a ) pa @xmath10 102  possibly tracing the equatorial plane of the molecular / dusty torus around the central engine ; ( b ) pa @xmath10 12  which features the axis of the torus and is found to be close to the axis of the ionizing cone to the north - east .",
    "the location of the central engine  only visible directly in the ir as an unresolved core carrying around 90% of the emission and in the radio as the radio source s1 in muxlow et al ( 1996 )  is taken here as that derived by marco et al ( 1997 ) from simultaneous k and i band high resolution imaging with adaptive optics .",
    "given the error bar on this position ( @xmath11 ) , it is coincident with the astrometric position of the 12.4 @xmath12 m unresolved core ( braatz et al 1993 ) , the k band peak observed by thatte et al ( 1997 ) and the center of symmetry of the polarization pattern in the near - ir and mid - ir ( lumsden et al 1999 ) .",
    "we leave aside attempts at locating the central engine from uv data which are quite sensitive to dust extinction and provide so far discrepant results ( capetti et al 1995a & b , kishimoto 1999 ) .",
    "we present and discuss results of long - slit spectroscopy in the near - ir , obtained with isaac at vlt / antu on eso / paranal . in this letter , we concentrate on the h@xmath1 2.12 @xmath6 line emission observed over a @xmath0 region through the central engine at pa @xmath10 102",
    ". the kinematics of the hot molecular gas in particular is investigated to test the presence of an eventual super massive object in ngc1068 .",
    "the observations were performed using the sws1 short wavelength arm of the instrument isaac attached to the nasmyth focus of antu ( moorwood et al 1999 , cuby et al 2000 ) .",
    "the measured seeing value was of @xmath13 ( fwhm ) in the k band .",
    "the slit width was set to @xmath14 while its length was of @xmath15 at pa @xmath10 102 .",
    "a spectrum was first obtained with the slit centered on the near - ir unresolved core , imaged prior to the spectroscopic observations .",
    "then the position of the slit was offset by @xmath14 and @xmath16 on each side of the core , to the north and to the south , providing a complete mapping of a @xmath17 area .",
    "a complete description of the data collection and reduction procedures is given in galliano & alloin ( 2001 ) .",
    "the final spectral resolution at the observed 2.15 @xmath6 wavelength of the h@xmath1 line is 35 km / s .",
    "+ from the reduced 2d spectra , we extracted a series of 1d spectra , through a window 3 pixels - high ( i.e. @xmath18 ) along the slit , and with a sliding step of 1 pixel ( @xmath19 ) . in the very central area ,",
    "the intense continuum produces a fringing pattern at the level of 4% ( peak to peak ) that can not be fully corrected , leaving some residuals which prevent the measurement of eventual faint h@xmath1 line emission at a distance less than 15 pc from the central engine .",
    "we provide in figure  [ fig1 ] , a set of the h@xmath1 line profiles observed at various positions across the @xmath0 central area extended along the equatorial plane of the suspected torus ( pa @xmath10 102 ) . at each position",
    ", the displayed line profile corresponds to an @xmath20 emitting patch .",
    "we did not deconvolve the individual successive spectra : given the seeing ( @xmath13 in the k band ) , each spectrum is only moderately contaminated by its neighbours .",
    "the h@xmath1 line profiles are presented in the following manner : for each frame , offset coordinates of the patch to which the line - profile refers are given with respect to the central engine location .",
    "the horizontal axis provides the offsets along pa@xmath10 102  and the vertical axis the offsets along pa@xmath10 12 . in each frame , the black ( thin ) line features the line profile observed to the west of the agn ( from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) , while the red ( thick ) line features the line profile observed to the east ( from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , each frame provides the line profile of a given patch and the line profile of its symmetrical counter part with respect to the axis of the suspected torus .",
    "because of a large difference between the @xmath25 line fluxes to the east and west of the central engine , we have rescaled by a factor 3 , in figure  [ fig1 ] , the line profiles detected to the west . in most of the frames , the @xmath25 line shows a complex profile : from double peak ( north ) to the presence of an extended wing ( blue wing to the west and red wing to the east ) .",
    "the velocity difference between the main peaks in two symmetrical patches is maximum for patches [ @xmath26;@xmath27 and [ @xmath26;@xmath28 and reaches a value of @xmath29 .      for each @xmath20 emitting patch",
    "we have measured the total integrated h@xmath1 line emission and , from these values , we have reconstructed the 2d map in h@xmath1 line emission shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the existence of two symmetrical emission knots ( eastern and western knots ) with large flux difference is conspicuous .",
    "this map can be compared to the early image in the h@xmath1 line provided by rotaciuc et al ( 1991 , their figure 2 ) , within the limitation of different spatial resolutions and spatial coverage .",
    "indeed , the isaac reconstructed h@xmath1 map is consistent with the inner part of the image by rotaciuc , although the more limited area covered by the isaac data set may miss the maximum of the western knot ( which is also slightly shifted to the south ) .",
    "a detailed flux comparison between h@xmath1 data sets obtained previously ( references in section 1 ) and the isaac data set is presented in galliano & alloin ( 2001 ) .",
    "we concentrate here on the positional / kinematical aspects measured for the first time from this isaac h@xmath1 data .",
    "the strong eastern h@xmath1 knot , located about @xmath4 to the east of the central engine , is also well identified in velocity space ( figure  [ diagposvit_0 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the eastern and western knots , extended and asymmetric wings on the line profiles suggest the presence of an extended source of h@xmath1 emission , possibly in the form of an outflow ( galliano & alloin 2001 ) .",
    "we have also reconstructed a 2d map of the average continuum between @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( not shown here ) from which we have positioned the cross featuring the central engine in figure 2 .      as a first order result , a jump in radial velocity of about @xmath32",
    "is detected between the eastern and western knots at 70 pc from the central engine .",
    "the [ position velocity ] diagram ( figure  [ diagposvit_0 ] ) enlights this result .",
    "if the material associated with these knots pertains to a structured ensemble of molecular clouds in keplerian orbit , this implies the presence of an enclosed object with dynamical mass @xmath3 .",
    "a comparable value is found by schinnerer et al ( 2000 ) from co line emission observed on a scale of @xmath33 . yet",
    ", the enclosed central mass derived from h@xmath1o maser observations on a scale of less than 1 pc , is only @xmath34 ( greenhill & gwinn 1997 )",
    ". it should be noticed as well that the rotation axis of the molecular and maser `` pseudo '' discs differ by at least 30 .",
    "this result suggests that the mass enclosed within the 70 pc radius region around the central engine in ngc1068 is shared among different components .    at second order , across the western knot itself , an increase of the h@xmath1 line velocity",
    "is observed towards the center , as expected in the case of pseudo - keplerian rotation of the system , but a similar behaviour does not appear in an obvious way in the eastern knot where the brightest peak seems to remain at constant blueshift when approaching the center . considering the large flux difference between both sides",
    ", we can not exclude a superposition of components along the line of sight to the east of the central engine , or the existence of peculiar kinematics as discussed from co line data by schinnerer et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "a more refined analysis of the velocity field of the h@xmath1 emitting molecular material is in progress , aiming in particular at fitting the line profiles across the entire region .",
    "the integrated h@xmath1 line map derived from isaac data can be compared with the @xmath35 map recently obtained at iram with an @xmath36 beam by schinnerer et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "the strong h@xmath1 line emission of the eastern knot is detected as well in co , at the same location .",
    "on the western side , the isaac spatial coverage does not allow to check whether the co peak  located @xmath37 to the west and @xmath4 to the south  is also emitting in the h@xmath1 line .",
    "however , we do detect in h@xmath1 the tip of the western co knot .",
    "the spatial coincidence of co and h@xmath1 emission in the eastern and western knots is interesting and indicative that , in these knots , h@xmath1 is emitted in photo ( or / and x - ray ) dissociation regions ( pdr or xdr ) at the surface of molecular clouds . given the agn environment , rich in uv photons , x - rays and shocks , it is still unclear what would be the main source of excitation of the h@xmath1 line . for the time - being ,",
    "let us simply assume that the h@xmath1 line emission originates from molecular gas at temperature around 2000 k ( e.g. hawarden et al 1995 ) : we find that the total observed h@xmath1 line emission in the @xmath38 central area is of @xmath39 , corresponding to a total luminosity of @xmath40 .",
    "following thompson ( 1978 ) , an amount of @xmath41 of hot molecular gas is needed to produce this emission .",
    "conversely , co line emission is thought to arise from cold molecular gas with temperature at least one order of magnitude less ( e.g. barvainis et al , 1997 ) .",
    "the total mass of molecular hydrogen derived from the co line flux by schinnerer & al ( 2000 ) , over the same region , is of the order of @xmath42 , 4 orders of magnitude larger than the hot emitting h@xmath1 molecular gas .",
    "such a result is not surprising and is consistent with the pdrs or xdrs origin of h@xmath1 .",
    "still to be understood is the more diffuse h@xmath1 emission which is traced in the wings in the h@xmath1 line profiles ( figure 1 ) and we are developping a kinematical model for this extended component ( galliano & alloin 2001 ) .",
    "another interesting point to resolve is whether the dynamical mass @xmath3 enclosed within a 70 pc radius region around the central engine ( as derived both from cold and hot molecular gas kinematics independently ) corresponds to a super massive confined object or a mass - distributed component ( stellar cluster and molecular / dust gas ) .",
    "as there is most probably a contribution from each of these components , their respective share is an issue we intend to address in the near future ( galliano & alloin 2001 ) .    we are gratefully indebted to the eso service observing team on paranal and to the user support group and archive support group at eso / garching for efficient help .",
    "we acknowledge precious advice from c. lidman for the isaac spectra reduction and interesting comments from an anonymous referee ."
