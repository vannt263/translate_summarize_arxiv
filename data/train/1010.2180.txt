    "recently , the reaction @xmath11 has become accessible in photoproduction experiments on the deuteron or nuclei  @xcite . at energies around @xmath1 gev ,",
    "an excess of @xmath0 production on the neutron compared to the proton case has been reported in these experiments . on the theoretical side ,",
    "this excess has been interpreted as a potential signal for a non - strange member of an anti - decuplet of pentaquarks  @xcite although the most prominent of these states , the @xmath12 , may come from a peak created by the experimental cuts , helped by a statistical fluctuation due to the limited statistic of the experiment @xcite . for the peak in @xmath11 , there are also other explanations mostly in terms of different interfering partial waves  @xcite .    in the presented work , the phenomenon is addressed within the chiral unitary framework developed in ref .",
    "details on the results presented in these proceedings can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular a thorough discussion on the stability of the results .",
    "the hadronic interaction in the present framework  @xcite is mediated by the weinberg - tomozawa interaction in the coupled channels @xmath13 , and @xmath2 , unitarized in a bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the model also contains explicit resonance states which account for the @xmath14 and a phenomenological background .",
    "the gauge invariant implementation of the photon interaction follows refs .",

    "the ratio of these cross sections is shown ( solid line ) .",
    "the dashed line indicates the ratio of cross sections on free nucleons , which becomes fermi smeared ( solid line ) .",
    "the appearance of the sharp peak in @xmath29 is obviously due to the intermediate states @xmath28 and @xmath2 in the model . indeed , both in @xmath21 and @xmath20 , the photon can couple to charged pions and kaons in the intermediate @xmath30 and @xmath2 states ; however , in @xmath20 the photon coupling to the @xmath31 in the @xmath32 state is possible , while this is not possible in @xmath21 , because the corresponding intermediate state is given by @xmath33  @xcite . for the ratio @xmath29",
    ", this difference manifests itself in the observed peak structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : deueta ] to the right . indeed , removing the photon coupling to the @xmath32 state in the @xmath34 reaction , one obtains the ratio given by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : deueta ] to the right ; the peak has disappeared .    to check for the model dependence of the presented results",
    ", we have replaced the hadronic final state interaction ( fsi ) with the weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) term .",
    "the photoproduction is then given by the triangle graph which contributes at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the chiral expansion of the amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the resulting ratio @xmath29 , shown as the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : deueta ] to the right ( multiplied by an arbitrary factor of 20 ) , is , of course , very different in magnitude from the full result ( dashed line )  replacing the strong , non - perturbative fsi by the tree - level wt term is certainly an oversimplification .",
    "however , the energy dependence shows the same pronounced @xmath35 cusps as the full result . in the future",
    ", the present results could be tested within the hadron exchange framework of ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath35 states have been included recently .    summarizing , the experimentally determined @xmath0 photoproduction cross sections on quasi - free neutron and proton can be explained quantitatively within the present model which accounts for the @xmath9 wave contribution only .",
    "the chiral coupled channels su(3 ) dynamics and its interplay with the photon lead to the occurrence of the observed spike - like structure in @xmath29 .",
    "the photoproduction of meson pairs is proving to be a rich field allowing us to widen our understanding of hadron dynamics and hadron structure . following much work devoted to the photoproduction of two pions in the last decade ,",
    "@xmath37 photoproduction has attracted attention recently  @xcite .",

    "the reaction was studied theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite and partial waves analyses of the reaction have been also performed  @xcite , finding the @xmath38 partial wave to be important . in the chiral unitary approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the process turned out to be dominated at low energies by the excitation of the @xmath38 , which then decays into @xmath39 , with the @xmath40 subsequently decaying into @xmath30 . in that approach , predictions of the cross section are possible because the @xmath41 and @xmath42 couplings are known from the chiral unitary framework  @xcite in which the @xmath38 appears dynamically generated . in ref .",
