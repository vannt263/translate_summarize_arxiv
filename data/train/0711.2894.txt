    "this study investigates the elastic mechanical properties of dense random isotropic two - dimensional assemblies of disks .",
    "our work is framed in the context of micromechanics , which focuses on the relation between macroscopic behavior and microscopic interactions . at the macroscopic scale , stress and strain",
    "are measured , whose relation is determined by the elastic moduli of the equivalent continuum . at the microscale , forces arise between contacting particles that for quasi - static deformations must satisfy the balance of force and moment for all grains . in the context of elasticity ,",
    "contact forces oppose the relative displacement between contacting grains by means of a contact stiffness .",
    "the work of poritzky @xcite about contacting thin disks reveals for its normal component a dependence on the overlap that rapidly weakens with the confining pressure .",
    "we assume for our assemblies the limit case of constant normal stiffness .",
    "since we focus on small displacements , we also consider the tangential stiffness constant @xcite . by ignoring all inhomogeneity in the contact stiffness ,",
    "we specifically focus on the effects of geometric disorder .",
    "given the geometry of the contact network , the constitutive law for the contact forces determines the macroscopic mechanical properties once the relative displacements at the contact points are known .",
    "many micromechanical studies @xcite use the so - called ` average strain hypothesis ' , where the relative displacements reduce to the contribution from the average strain .",
    "the resulting prediction of the elastic moduli is inaccurate @xcite , particularly for the shear modulus , as in general grains undergo additional displacements in order to attain equilibrium .",
    "more sophisticated predictions have recently been developed that incorporate such fluctuations , in @xcite for three - dimensional systems and in @xcite and @xcite for two - dimensional ones .",
    "they are based on the idea that even though the deformation is not uniform , its fluctuations are strongly correlated .",
    "the study by koenders @xcite suggests that they occur with correlation lengths in the order of a few diameters , which implies that subassemblies of such a size already contain the essential features of the global structure .",
    "the validity of the theoretical predictions in @xcite and @xcite is investigated here by comparison with the elastic moduli computed by means of discrete element method ( _ dem _ ) simulations .",
    "the analysis is performed for various ratios of tangential to normal stiffness and coordination numbers .",
    "we consider assemblies with both larger and smaller coordination number than the onset of iso - staticity for disordered frictionless systems .",
    "this onset equals @xmath2 in two dimensions and is recurrent in numerical simulations , as dense assemblies are usually obtained by means of an initial frictionless compression . in experiments",
    "@xcite on hard disks , coordination numbers smaller and larger than @xmath2 are due , in turn , to the presence of friction and of ordered structures . in dem simulations ,",
    "disordered assemblies with larger coordination numbers than the onset of isostacity can be obtained , for example by neglecting in the constitutive law for the contact force the increase in the normal stiffness with the interpenetration or by applying a large pressure .",
    "such systems are mainly of academic interest , particularly in the development of statistical approaches aimed at predicting the evolution of disordered systems .",
    "also in three dimensions the scientific literature concentrates on samples with larger coordination numbers than the frictionless onset of iso - staticity , which equals @xmath3 in that case .",
    "however , studies concerned with the issue of numerically reproducing experimental results @xcite , @xcite emphasize that lower ones might be relevant to practical purposes .",
    "the outline of the study is as follows .",
    "firstly , the basic micromechanical quantities of interest are defined in section [ micromechanics ] .",
    "then , a concise description is given in section [ theories ] of theoretical approaches for predicting the elastic moduli based , in turn , on the average strain assumption and on the inclusion of displacement fluctuations .",
    "the performed dem simulations are described in section [ dem simulations ] .",
    "the corresponding results are analyzed in section [ analysis ] and compared to the results the theoretical predictions .",
    "the final section is dedicated to discussion of the results .",
    "we consider the contact between disks @xmath4 and @xmath5 of radius @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the contact is identified by the unit vector @xmath8 that points outwards from @xmath4 along the line that joins the centers .",
    "the unit vector @xmath9 is tangent to the contact ( see figure [ contact geometry ] ) . in components , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the _ contact orientation _ , counted counterclockwise from the horizontal axis . for future reference",
    ", we also define the _ branch vector _ @xmath12 , that joins the centre of particle @xmath4 to that of particle @xmath5 pointing outwards from @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath13 as in monodisperse two - dimensional assemblies crystallization occurs , a log - normal distribution for the particle radii is adopted .        contacting particles",
    "interact by means of contact forces .",
    "we denote by @xmath14 the @xmath15-th component of the force exerted on particle @xmath4 by particle @xmath5 .",
    "it has normal and tangential component to the contact @xmath16 and @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 in the hypothesis of quasi - static deformations , contact forces satisfy the balance of force and moment on each grain . for instance , on particle @xmath4 , @xmath19 where the sum is over particles @xmath5 that are in contact with it and @xmath20 is the two - dimensional permutation tensor .",
    "contact forces oppose the relative displacement between contacting particles by means of a contact stiffness , whose normal and tangential component we denote , in turn , by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , both considered constant .",
    "if we denote by @xmath23 the relative displacement between particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 that are in contact , and by @xmath24 and @xmath25 its normal and tangential component , we have @xmath26 the theory of contact elasticity predicts the decay with the distance from the contact zone of the effects of contact interactions . for small enough deformations and stiff enough particles ,",
    "as we assume to be the case here , contact interactions can be assumed to be confined to a contact point , and the grains kinematics to be approximated by that of rigid bodies .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath28 are the displacement of the centre of particle @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 their rotation .    at the macroscopic , continuum level , the relevant quantities are the stress tensor @xmath31 and the strain tensor @xmath32 , whose components are taken positive in compression . contact forces and the geometry of the particle arrangement determine the expression of the former , as @xcite @xmath33 that is the average over the area of interest @xmath34 of cauchy s stress @xcite .",
    "the orientation @xmath35 varies between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "finally , the superscript @xmath38 referring to contacting particles has been replaced by for corresponding contacts @xmath39 .",
    "expression ( [ stresstheta ] ) emphasizes the dependence of the macroscopic behavior on the average force over equally oriented contacts .",
    "experimental observations and numerical simulations @xcite suggest for it the same dependence on the contact orientation as for the effects of the average strain .",
    "that is , compressive forces are the larger the closer the contact orientation is to the direction of major compression , and tangential forces have their maximum at contacts oriented at 45 degrees from it .",
    "primary geometrical characteristics of granular assemblies are coordination number @xmath40 , i.e. the average number of contacts per particle , contact density @xmath41 , i.e. the average number of particles per unit surface , and the contact distribution function @xmath42 @xcite , defined such that @xmath43 gives the probability of finding a contact with orientation @xmath44 in the interval @xmath45 , @xmath46 . in the case of _ isotropic _ assemblies , as considered here , the contact distribution function becomes @xmath47 . with the use of such quantities and by denoting averages over equally oriented contacts by overbars , expression ( [ stresstheta ] ) transforms into the integral @xmath48 the elastic stiffness tensor relates stress and strain . in isotropic systems , it is fully described by the effective bulk modulus @xmath49 and shear modulus @xmath50 , as @xmath51 we determine them by means of dem computer simulations , by applying , in order , an isotropic compressive deformation @xmath52 and a shear deformation @xmath53 : @xmath54 and measuring the corresponding stress response .",
    "by @xmath55 we denote a magnitude of the imposed strain .",
    "if the deformation @xmath56 is prescribed , the theoretical prediction of the elastic moduli requires that of the corresponding stress tensor @xmath57 . due to ( [ contactconstitutiverelation ] )",
    ", this in turn requires a kinematic localization assumption , that is , the expression of the relative displacements between contacting particles as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "this procedure is depicted in figure [ localisation ] .",
    "various kinematic localization assumptions are considered in this section , such as the uniform strain assumption and more sophisticated approaches that account for fluctuations .          in the hypothesis of uniform strain",
    "the relative displacement between contacting particles becomes @xmath58 its average over equally oriented contacts in the case of isotropic compression is isotropic .",
    "only its normal component @xmath59 differs from zero , namely @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the average length of the branch vector . in the case of shear , the average normal and tangential component @xmath62 and @xmath63 of @xmath23 over equally oriented contacts are , in turn , @xmath64 for isotropic assemblies of disks , the average strain assumption results in the bulk and shear moduli @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite : @xmath67 \\overline{\\text { } l^{2 } } , \\label{moduliaccordingtouniform strain}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that are upper bounds .",
    "the symbol @xmath68 denotes the average over all contacts of the squared length of the branch vector . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", polydispersity makes the average length of the branch vector differ in general from the average diameter . for our size distribution @xmath61",
    "is about @xmath69 larger than the average diameter , and @xmath68 is about @xmath70 larger than the average diameter squared .",
    "two approaches are considered that incorporate the fluctuations into the prediction of the elastic moduli , namely the particle - fluctuation ( 1pf ) and the pair - fluctuation method ( pf ) .",
    "they are discussed in detail in @xcite and in @xcite , respectively . in @xcite ,",
    "the 1pf approach is applied numerically and proven to give upper bounds to the effective moduli , while in @xcite the analytical solution that corresponds to the pf method is presented .",
    "both approaches deal with the issue of equilibrium of a small assembly , made of a chosen particle @xmath71 and of a contacting pair @xmath72 , respectively , surrounded by their first neighbors .",
    "therefore , in these models fluctuations are assumed to occur with correlation lengths in the order of 3 or 4 diameters .    in the more general case",
    ", the relative displacement between contacting particles can be decomposed into the contribution from averages and fluctuations , that is , from the imposed strain and the average particle rotation , on one side , and from fluctuations in particle displacements and rotations , on the other . in the absence of macroscopic rotation ,",
    "as it is the case here , in an isotropic system the average particle rotation is zero @xcite .",
    "if we denote by @xmath73 and @xmath74 the fluctuation of contacting particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the center displacement , and by @xmath75 and @xmath76 the fluctuations in rotations , we can write : @xmath77    .",
    "the deformation of the particles shown in gray is according to uniform strain , while @xmath71 is allowed to fluctuate .",
    "its fluctuations stem from the balance of force and moment on it.,width=226 ]    in the 1pf and the pf approach , only the chosen particle or pair is allowed to fluctuate , while their neighborhood is compelled to move according to the average strain .",
    "this is depicted in figure [ pfmethod ] for the 1pf case . as a result , in the 1pf method",
    "the relative displacement between particle @xmath71 and its @xmath78-th neighbor reduces to @xmath79 so that the three equilibrium equations for particle @xmath71 can be solved for its three unknown fluctuations . in the pair - fluctuation method , @xmath80 but @xmath81 where @xmath78 denotes a neighbor of particle @xmath71 different from @xmath82 , and @xmath83 a neighbor of particle @xmath82 different from @xmath71 .",
    "the six equilibrium equations of particles @xmath71 and @xmath82 can be solved for the corresponding six fluctuations . in both cases ,",
    "the small size of the solving system permits an analytical formulation .    in this work ,",
    "the equilibrium equations are solved numerically , particle by particle and pair by pair for the 1pf and the pf approach , respectively , for the corresponding fluctuations . using the procedure sketched in figure [ localisation ] ,",
    "the corresponding contact forces are computed and the stress and elastic moduli estimated .",
    "the resulting fluctuations are also analyzed in terms of the associated deformation mechanisms in the sections that follow .",
    "dem simulations have been performed of large isotropic assemblies of 50,000 disks , with radii from a lognormal distribution .",
    "periodic boundaries have been employed to reduce boundary effects .    in the dem method ,",
    "the deformation of the assemblies is computed by numerically integrating in time the equations of motion of all particles , and the results can be employed to analyze the actual deformation mechanisms .",
    "initial equilibrium states with coordination numbers @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 have been first prepared . to obtain the first one , a succession of frictionless and frictional compressions has been employed .",
    "the second one results from the isotropic compression of a frictionless gas , and the third one results from an additional isotropic compression .",
    "the assemblies obtained this way have been subjected to the two strain paths specified by eqn.([loading paths ] ) .",
    "then , the corresponding stress response has been computed in order to determine the effective bulk and shear moduli @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "such simulations have been performed with bonded contacts : that is , neither contact creation nor disruption has been considered , which is appropriate for studying elastic behavior at small strains . at each coordination number , different ratios @xmath87 have been used , in the range between 0.05 and 1.0 .",
    "in this section , the results from the dem simulations and the theoretical approaches introduced in section [ theories ] are analyzed .",
    "the comparison between the elastic moduli from the dem simulations and the uniform strain assumption emphasizes the relevance of displacement fluctuations .",
    "the quality of the estimates of the elastic moduli given by the 1pf and the pf methods is also evaluated .",

    "the inclusion of the fluctuations with as few degrees of freedom as in the 1pf and pf methods does not guarantee an improvement with respect to the average strain assumption , as the case of the bulk modulus at @xmath96 proves .",
    "the dem simulations point out the dependence of the bulk modulus on the tangential stiffness , ignored by the average strain assumption , but captured once fluctuations are accounted for .",
    "the reason tofor such a dependence lies in the fact that even though the tangential forces are zero on average in hydrostatic compression , they are required at the particle level in order for the forces and moments to balance . by opposing the relative displacements along the tangential direction , the tangential forces stiffen the assembly , the more so the larger the tangential stiffness .",
    "the general belief that the average strain assumption gives a good approximation of the bulk modulus seems hardly acceptable , at least below the onset of iso - staticity for frictionless systems and at small ratios @xmath92 . regarding the shear modulus , the inclusion of the fluctuations into the prediction results in a significant improvement with respect to the average strain assumption , although important deviations from the dem simulations remain , especially for low coordination number and low stiffness ratios @xmath92 .",

    "typical group averages for the case of shear loading are shown in figure [ displ35 ] , where along the tangential direction the contributions from the center displacement and the rotation have been separated .",

    ". however , the relaxation they induce is underestimated , and the stiffening observed in the case of the particle displacement generally overestimated .",
    "the difference between estimate and measured values at low coordination number in the case of shear emphasizes the necessity of considering larger correlation lengths if reliable predictions of the mechanical behavior of such systems are to be obtained . given the remarkable improvement already obtained with respect to the average strain assumption , it might be sufficient to incorporate the fluctuations of the first neighbors .",
    "this study has emphasized the insufficiency of the average strain assumption in predicting the elastic moduli of granular media , especially in presence of shear , as particles undergo important additional displacements and rotations in order to attain equilibrium .",
    "this particularly holds in the case of coordination numbers smaller than that corresponding to the onset of iso - staticity for frictionless assemblies , whose occurrence seems relevant to practical purposes .",
    "we have shown that the role of the fluctuations is clearly phrased in terms of the relative displacements they induce at the contact points , coherently with the constitutive law for the contact forces .",
    "the relative displacements due to the fluctuations are highly correlated with contact orientation . along the normal and the tangential direction , respectively ,",
    "their average over equally oriented contacts is proportional to the relative displacements aligned with them and due to the average strain .",
    "such a proportionality is expressed by the numerical factors @xmath108 for the case of isotropic compression , and @xmath125 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 in the case of shear .",
    "their numerical value allows one to interpret the role of the different kinematic ingredients to the relaxation observed at the macroscopic scale .",
    "we have found that the normal component of the center displacements and the rotations always oppose the effect of the average strain . on the contrary",
    ", the tangential component of the center displacements generally stiffens the assembly , with the exception of large ratios @xmath92 at large coordination number .",
    "we have analyzed two approaches that include the fluctuations from the average strain into the prediction of the elastic moduli , namely the  particle - fluctuation  and the  pair - fluctuation  method .",
    "they both determine the fluctuations by considering the problem of equilibrium of a small subassembly .",
    "that is , they are based on the assumption that the fluctuations organize with short correlation length , in the order of three or four diameters .",
    "the comparison with the dem simulations shows a significant improvement in predicting the moduli with respect to the average strain assumption .",
    "the deformation mechanisms are qualitatively captured , even at small coordination numbers , together with their dependence on the ratio between tangential and normal stiffness and on coordination number , thus proving the correctness of the approach .",
    "however , the models do not capture with sufficient accuracy the fluctuations at low coordination numbers when a shear loading is applied ( especially for the tangential relative displacements ) .",
    "this may be caused by the occurrence of larger correlation lengths than those assumed here .",
    "future work will focus on identifying the correct correlation length .",
    "an other open issue is the mechanical behavior at ratios of tangential to normal stiffness larger than one , that easily occur at the contact between cylinders far from the onset of sliding .",
    "the independence of the @xmath130 s on the contact orientation assesses that the fluctuations that determine the macroscopic behavior originate in the average geometry of the assembly .",
    "therefore , analytical approaches can capture them . as the average geometry is disordered",
    ", its representation has to be resolved in statistical terms , as done in the analytical solution in @xcite .",
    "even though the issue has not been dealt with in this manuscript , we anticipate that the cited analytical prediction gives less accurate results than the numerical implementation of the corresponding approach .",
    "this emphasizes the sensitivity of the modeling to the details of the statistical representation .",
    "this representation is still a critical issue whose improvement we will pursue .",
