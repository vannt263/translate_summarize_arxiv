    "the fermi liquid is a metallic state which is adiabatically continuable to a non - interacting electron gas . its low - energy excitations are in one - to - one correspondence with those of the non - interacting system .",
    "many attempts to uncover non - fermi - liquid metallic behavior in strongly - correlated electron systems have focused on enhanced scattering mechanisms which might lead to anomalous behavior in the electron green function . in this paper",
    ", we attempt a different tack and focus on metallic states with a conventional fermi surface which can be distinguished from fermi liquids by an _ order parameter_. in order to preserve the fermi surface , the order parameter is taken to be _ odd in frequency_@xcite .",
    "when the order parameter breaks a continuous symmetry , the low - energy spectrum must also include goldstone modes . as a result ,",
    "odd - frequency ordering is a mechanism by which the set of low - energy excitations can be expanded from those of a fermi liquid ( so that they are no longer in one - to - one correspondence with those of a free fermi gas ) , leading to a manifestly non - fermi liquid state .",
    "a number of authors have considered superconducting states with order parameters @xmath0 which are odd in frequency@xcite .",
    "the energetic advantage of such a state is that it would enable the electrons to avoid instantaneous coulomb repulsion while still benefitting from pairing .",
    "some exactly soluble one - dimensional models , such as the one - dimensional kondo lattice , have a tendency towards such ordering @xcite .",
    "however , there are claims that the simplest models of odd - frequency superconducting states suffer from pathologies which make them unstable @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the analogous states in the particle - hole channels .",
    "we find that simple models of odd - frequency density wave states do not suffer from any pathologies ( and suspect that this holds for the corresponding superconducting states , as well ) .",
    "odd - frequency states can exhibit a number of interesting non - fermi liquid properties including the goldstone modes mentioned above , a range of states above the fermi surface with finite lifetimes even in the limit of vanishing frequency and temperature @xmath1 , and a non - mean - field - like temperature - dependent order parameter .    however , the question of their detection is non - trivial and cuts to the heart of attempts to experimentally distinguish non - fermi liquids from fermi liquids .",
    "while an odd - frequency superconducting state is , first and foremost , a superconducting state , which would be identified by its vanishing resistivity , meissner effect , etc . , an odd - frequency density wave state can masquerade as a fermi liquid since the order parameter vanishes at zero frequency .",
    "there will be signatures in thermodynamic and transport measurements , but they can easily be mistakenly attributed to other effects , as we discuss below .",
    "an odd - frequency charge - density wave state is defined by the anomalous correlation function @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an odd function of frequency , @xmath4    to find an equal - time correlation function which serves as an order - parameter , we fourier transform ( [ eqn : op - def ] ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is imaginary and odd in @xmath7 .",
    "hence , we can use the time - derivative as an order parameter : @xmath8    the state defined by these order parameters , ( [ eqn : op - def ] ) or ( [ eqn : order_time_deriv ] ) , breaks translational symmetry .",
    "time - reversal symmetry is not broken .",
    "this is most easily seen by considering ( [ eqn : order_time ] ) . taking the complex conjugate of both sides of ( [ eqn : order_time ] ) gives @xmath9 meanwhile , ( [ eqn : order_time ] ) is transformed under time - reversal , @xmath10 , into : @xmath11 and , hence , the order parameter does not break time - reversal symmetry . in going from the first equality to the second , we have used ( [ eqn : order - cc ] ) .",
    "an odd - frequency spin - density wave is defined by @xmath12 where @xmath3 is again an odd function of frequency and @xmath13 is the direction chosen spontaneously by the ordered state .",
    "this state breaks translational symmetry and spin - rotational symmetry , which is broken to the @xmath14 subgroup of rotations about @xmath13 .",
    "again , time - reversal is preserved .",
    "such a state will exhibit a non - zero expectations value and anomalous correlations of the spin nematic order parameter , @xmath15 , such as those discussed for spin - only models in @xcite .",
    "we now consider a simple two - dimensional model which admits an odd - frequency charge - density - wave state at the mean - field level .",
    "the model contains a non - singular four - fermion interaction which can be generated by the exchange of phonons or some gapped electronic collective mode . for simplicity , we focus on the charge - density - wave case ; the spin - density - wave is analogous .",
    "we consider an effective action which consists of a kinetic term @xmath16 and an interaction term @xmath17_c } \\ : { v_{kk^{\\prime } } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad \\times { \\biggl[{c^{\\beta \\dagger } } ( k^{\\prime}){\\partial_\\tau } { c_\\beta}(k^{\\prime}+q)\\biggr]_c } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to avoid clutter , the @xmath18 is used as shorthand for the integrals over @xmath19 .",

    "to incommensurate order and other band structures is straightforward .",
    "the interaction term @xmath27 is long - ranged in precisely the same way as the bcs reduced interaction .",
    "a more realistic short - ranged interaction would be of the form @xmath28_c } \\:{v^q_{kk^{\\prime}}}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad \\times { \\biggl[{c^{\\beta \\dagger}}(k^{\\prime}){\\partial_\\tau } { c_\\beta}(k^{\\prime}+q)\\biggr]_c},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which includes ( [ eqn : l_int ] ) as one term in the sum over @xmath29 .",
    "such an interaction could arise from the diagram of figure [ fig : int - diag ] if the collective mode has a propagator of the form @xmath30 if @xmath31 is small , then we can expand the collective mode propagator to obtain @xmath24 , for @xmath32 .",
    "other terms will also be generated which could drive the formation of even - frequency order , but they appear to be weaker .",
    "= 1.8 in    we assume an order parameter of the form : @xmath33 according to our previous observations , @xmath34 is real .",
    "then the mean - field action takes the form @xmath35 the equation of motion following from the mean - field action is : @xmath36 we multiply the equation of motion by @xmath37 and take the imaginary time - ordered expectation value . we see that the ordinary and anomalous green functions satisfy the equation : @xmath38 the right - hand - side results from the time - derivative ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) acting on the time - ordering symbol @xcite .",
    "if we make the replacement @xmath40 in ( [ eqn : eom ] ) , then we can derive a second equation in the same way , @xmath41 and the green function and anomalous green function for @xmath42 take the form :    @xmath43    one might naively think that equation ( [ eqn : fg_eq2 ] ) could be obtained by inspection from ( [ eqn : fg_eq1 ] ) by replacing @xmath44 by @xmath45 as one usually does in the case of an even - frequency gap . in this case , this would amount to the replacement of @xmath46 by @xmath47 , as was done in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of an odd - frequency gap , this simple substitution only works for _ real _ frequencies .",
    "since the gap is linear in frequency and the squared modulus of the gap appears in the green functions , the green functions are no longer analytic in the frequency . as a result ,",
    "the analytic continuation from real to matsubara frequencies is subtle .",
    "the safe route is to derive both ( [ eqn : fg_eq1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : fg_eq2 ] ) directly from the mean - field action , as we have done .",
    "the naive , incorrect form of ( [ eqn : fg_eq2 ] ) would lead to a negative superfluid density in the case of odd - gap superconductors . on the other hand ,",
    "the correct analogue of ( [ eqn : fg_eq2 ] ) for a superconducting action induced by disorder was used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath48 , @xmath49 vanishes and @xmath50 returns to its normal state form .",
    "in principle , we should also allow for a quasiparticle renormalization @xmath51 resulting from the interaction , but this does not qualitatively modify our results , so we drop this correction for simplicity .    from these green functions ,",
    "we see that , at @xmath52 , the odd - frequency charge - density - wave order parameter modifies the quasiparticle spectrum to : @xmath53 i.e. , it renormalizes the effective mass . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the effect is more complicated . as a result of the odd - frequency charge - density - wave",
    ", @xmath55 is replaced with @xmath56 from ( [ eqn : qp - spectrum ] ) , we see that the fermi surface is unmoved , i.e. , @xmath57 when @xmath58 , as we expect , since the order parameter vanishes at zero frequency .    furthermore , there is a range of @xmath59 values above the fermi surface , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 has an imaginary part , so that quasiparticles in this region have a finite lifetime .",
    "however , these states have zero occupation number , as the corresponding poles in the green functions turn out to be lying outside of the integration contour .",
    "this gives rise to a possibility of the ground state in which some of the quasiparticles are in levels which are in disconnected from the rest of the fermi sea .",
    "we must now impose a self - consistency condition on @xmath62 , which is the gap equation .",
    "we will also impose a condition on the particle number , thereby implicitly fixing the chemical potential .",
    "these conditions read :    @xmath63    for simplicity , we consider the case of half - filling , @xmath64 .",
    "we have repeated our calculations at non - zero doping and found similar results .",
    "the prime on the matsubara summations in ( [ eqn : gap - eqn ] ) , ( [ eqn : mu - eqn ] ) indicate that they are done with @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 only for @xmath68 .",
    "a more realistic model replaces the interaction with one that has a `` smooth '' cutoff @xmath69 and @xmath34 by @xmath70 , with @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "we can vary @xmath75 between the limit @xmath76 , which corresponds to a sharp cutoff , and @xmath77 which corresponds to the absence of a cutoff . for computational simplicity , we take @xmath78 .",
    "we now discuss the analysis of ( [ eqn : gap - eqn ] ) , ( [ eqn : mu - eqn ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the case of a sharp cutoff .",
    "the left - hand side of the gap equation vanishes if the temperature is above @xmath79 @xmath80 is the highest possible transition temperature for this system . just below this temperature",
    "there is only one pair of terms in the matsubara sum which is allowed by the cutoff @xmath21 . as the temperature",
    "is decreased , more matsubara frequencies begin to contribute , resulting in minor steps in the phase diagram .    for large @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "decreasing @xmath81 , we enter a regime , @xmath83 , in which the system is in the odd - frequency density - wave phase for an intermediate range of temperatures @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 is the location of the quantum phase transition at which the odd - frequency density - wave order first appears at zero temperature .",
    "it is obtained from ( [ eqn : gap - eqn ] ) by setting @xmath52 and @xmath86 and converting the matsubara sum into an integral : @xmath87 = \\frac { \\pi \\omega _ c^2}{\\lambda _ { c1}}.   \\label{eqn : lambda_c1}\\ ] ] the integrand is approximately @xmath88 for small @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "as @xmath92 is further decreased , @xmath93 increases and finally reaches @xmath94 at @xmath95 . to find @xmath95 , we again set @xmath52 and @xmath86 , but now we retain only the pair of terms in the matsubara sum corresponding to the frequencies @xmath96 : @xmath97 comparing expressions ( [ eqn : lambda_c1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : lambda_c2 ] ) , we find that the latter is larger by a factor of @xmath98 for large @xmath99 ; hence , @xmath100 .",
    "for @xmath101 , @xmath34 jumps discontinuously at @xmath94 .",
    "finally , for @xmath102 , there are no odd - frequency charge - density - wave solutions . as a result , the phase diagram has the shape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : odd - phase - diag ] ( dashed line ) with re - entrant transitions for @xmath103 .",
    "let us now consider how this picture is modified when we make the cutoff smooth , as it must be in a physical system .",
    "the sharpness of the steps which separate the re - entrant transitions depends on the details of the high - frequency cutoff ; they disappear in the limit that the cutoff is very smooth . when the cutoff is relatively sharp , more re - entrant transitions are possible , and there will be several temperature regions in which an odd - frequency charge - density wave occurs . however , for a smooth cutoff , there is typically only one such region .",
    "the transition at @xmath94 is replaced with a smooth curve @xmath104 , at which a second - order transition takes place .",
    "the corresponding phase boundary is depicted by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : odd - phase - diag ] .",
    "= 3.375 in    below @xmath105 , @xmath106 increases as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha - t ] .",
    "note that for a smooth cutoff all transitions are of second order , even though the rise of @xmath106 at @xmath107 is very steep for large values of @xmath81 and may give a false impression of a first - order transition .",
    "it is also noteworthy that even for large @xmath81 the order parameter @xmath106 rapidly attains its maximum as @xmath108 is decreased below @xmath109 and then decreases as @xmath110 to some non - zero asymptotic value .",
    "this has a significant impact on experimentally measurable parameters , as we describe in the following section .",
    "= 3.375 in    the unusual temperature dependence of the order parameter , which is reflected in the re - entrant phase diagram and ( as we will see in the next section ) the condensation energy , is a consequence of the frequency - dependence of the gap . in an ordinary , frequency - independent ( or weakly - dependent )",
    "ordered state , the condensation energy at weak - coupling comes primarily from states near the fermi energy . at high temperatures , these states are thermally excited ,",
    "so there is little condensation energy to be gained , and the order parameter decreases as the temperature is increased . in the case of odd - frequency ordered states , there is very little condensation energy to be gained from the particles near the fermi surface because their energy is low ( and , hence , they interact weakly with the order parameter ) . as a result , the order parameter and condensation energy decrease as the temperature is decreased .",
    "in fact , there is a second solution to the gap equation in which it is favorable to have a disconnected fermi sea in which some electrons are excited to a strip in momentum space above the fermi surface which is diconnected from the rest of the fermi sea , which is centered about @xmath111 .",
    "when this occurs , the occupation number does not increase monotonically with @xmath112 .",
    "however , this solution is higher in energy , so it does not occur .",
    "at @xmath109 , there will be the usual thermodynamic signatures of a second order phase transition .",
    "the condensation energy associated with this transition is the difference between the free energy of the odd - frequency charge - density - wave state and corresponding free energy of the normal state at the same temperature . at @xmath113 and with a sharp cutoff , @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "this equation is obtained by using @xmath34 as a hubbard - stratonovich field to decouple ( [ eqn : l_int ] ) , resulting in the first term in ( [ eqn : cond_energy ] ) .",
    "the electronic action is then the mean - field action ( [ eqn : action_mf ] ) , so that the partition function may be evaluated to give the second term in ( [ eqn : cond_energy ] ) . at zero temperature",
    ", the integrals may be evaluated analytically : @xmath116 the last term is overwhelmingly negative , as may be seen in various limits ( e.g. , @xmath117 or @xmath118 ) .",
    "note that the energetic gain comes not from the terms in the frequency sum ( [ eqn : cond_energy ] ) with small matsubara frequency , which actually increase energy , but from the terms near the cutoff  in a complete reversal of the situation for a frequency - independent gap@xcite .",
    "again , for a smooth cutoff the matsubara frequency sum becomes infinite and @xmath106 should be replaced with @xmath119 . for smooth cutoff and finite temperature ,",
    "the condensation energy must be evaluated numerically .",
    "the dependence of the condensation energy @xmath120 on temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy - t ] . unlike in even - frequency phases , where @xmath121 slowly increases as the system cools down and attains its maximum at zero temperature , in our model it rapidly reaches a maximum and decreases to a constant asymptotic value as @xmath110 .",
    "as may be seen in figure [ fig : energy - t ] , the condensation energy is of order of @xmath122 at the maximum , which is comparable to the maximum condensation energy attained in even - frequency phases .    = 3.375 in    the dc conductivity can be computed from the kubo formula .",
    "we assume a model in which impurities give rise to a lifetime , @xmath123 .",
    "the resulting conductivity is given by @xmath124 where @xmath61 is given in ( [ eqn : qp - spectrum ] ) .",
    "for small @xmath125 , the modification of the quasiparticle spectrum in the odd - frequency charge - density - wave phase reduces to the rescaling of the electron mass near the fermi surface , so that the new effective mass is @xmath126 .",
    "this mass enhancement leads to a noticeable increase of the resistivity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond ] . of course",
    ", outside of the the region @xmath127 the resistivity is that of the normal phase .",
    "in this work we have considered a model with an odd - frequency charge - density - wave solution . the transition to this state",
    "is signaled by a second - order phase transition with a jump in the specific heat . for strong interactions ,",
    "the model is in an odd - frequency charge - density - wave phase for all temperatures @xmath128 . for moderately weak interactions ,",
    "the model is in such a phase for an intermediate temperature regime @xmath129 .",
    "there is a quantum phase transition at @xmath130 ; for weaker interactions , the system is not ordered at @xmath131 .",
    "a similar model admits an odd - frequency spin - density - wave ground state .",
    "such a state will have , in addition to its fermi - liquid - like quasiparticles , goldstone boson excitations . as a result @xmath15 ,",
    "has a non - zero expectation value , and its correlation functions have goldstone poles .",
    "the method that we used to derive the green functions of the odd - frequency density wave can be applied to the analysis of odd - frequency superconductivity as well , with some modification .",
    "the corresponding mean field theory should describe a stable state with positive superfluid density .",
    "odd - frequency charge - density wave order results in mass enhancement .",
    "this affects transport properties ; in the density - wave state the resistivity is considerably larger than in the normal state .",
    "the effect is largest at intermediate temperatures . at low temperatures ,",
    "the system is either in the normal state ( for @xmath132 ) or in an ordered state ( for @xmath133 ) with some asymptotic value of the order parameter .",
    "this type of non - monotonic resistivity curve has been observed in a number of strongly - correlated electron systems . in layered materials such as the cuprates and ruthenates",
    ", it has been observed in @xmath20-axis transport @xcite . in 2degs , this type of behavior has been observed in the vicinity of a putative metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "it would be premature to suggest that odd - frequency order is developing in any of these experiments , but it is noteworthy that it does provide a natural explanation of otherwise puzzling behavior .",
    "odd - frequency density wave ordering is also manifested in thermodynamics .",
    "unlike in even - frequency states , where the condensation energy @xmath121 is small near the phase transition and reaches a maximum at zero temperature , in odd - frequency states the maximum of @xmath121 is located near the upper critical temperature .",
    "consequently , there is strong variation of all thermodynamic quantities with temperature just below @xmath109 .",
    "again , at lower temperatures these phenomena disappear .",
    "the model that we have introduced is certainly simplified , as it ignores the possible proximity of other phases .",
    "however , we believe that odd - frequency density - wave order can result when a tendency towards ordinary even - frequency density - wave order is frustrated by some competing interaction .",
    "the resolution of the competition will depend on the scales at which the various interactions act  essentially @xmath21 in our model . in particular , one can imagine a scenario in which an ordinary even - frequency density wave is favorable at higher temperatures , but below a certain temperature , the system undergoes a transition into an odd - frequency state .",
