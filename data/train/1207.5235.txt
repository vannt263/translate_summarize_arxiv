    "the adiabatic theorem of hermitian quantum mechanics provides the basis for many experimental schemes to manipulate and control quantum systems .",
    "prominent examples from atomic physics include the rap and stirap schemes @xcite for population transfer in effective two or three level systems . in many applications ,",
    "however , quantum systems have states with finite lifetimes described by complex energies .",
    "these more realistic situations can not be described by conventional hermitian quantum mechanics , but require an additional anti - hermitian part in the hamiltonian ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . due to the analogy of the time dependent schrdinger equation and the paraxial approximation for light propagation in optical media @xcite , the dynamics generated by non - hermitian hamiltonians",
    "can conveniently be realized using optical systems @xcite .",
    "it has previously been pointed out in the literature that the adiabatic theorem does not necessarily hold for non - hermitian systems @xcite , and it has recently been shown that this can lead to new effects in the `` deep '' non - hermitian regime in the presence of exceptional points @xcite .",
    "however , it is often assumed that _ small _ decay rates do not modify the systems behaviour drastically , and their effects on adiabatic behaviour seem hitherto not to have been fully appreciated .    here",
    "we show that even a small decay rate , which does not modify the static behaviour of a system significantly , can lead to a breakdown of adiabatic transfer properties .",
    "we demonstrate this fact for a stirap - related scheme , which is readily implemented in optical waveguide structures . in this scheme a sharp threshold for the breakdown of the transfer property is observed , which we calculate to a good approximation using simple analytical arguments .",
    "note that models similar to the one considered here also appear in the context of cavity qed systems @xcite .",
    "the stirap scheme was originally proposed and implemented for population transfer in three - level atoms @xcite .",
    "recently , stirap - type schemes have also been implemented in optical waveguides @xcite , where the propagation distance @xmath0 takes the role of time in conventional quantum systems .",
    "the optical realization allows for a straightforward experimental implementation of additional decay of varying strength using absorbing materials .",
    "thus , in what follows we shall proceed our analysis in the waveguide context .",
    "the propagation of light in this system is governed by a schrdinger type equation , where the propagation distance @xmath0 takes over the role of time in conventional quantum systems @xcite : @xmath1 in a system of @xmath2 waveguides @xmath3 is a vector in @xmath4 , whose components are the wave amplitudes in the different waveguides , and the hamiltonian @xmath5 encodes the refractive index in the waveguides as well as the coupling between them .        in the following , we study a generalization of the setup investigated in @xcite , which consists of two parallel ( left and right ) waveguides with an additional diagonally directed central waveguide , as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "since the couplings between neighbouring waveguides depend exponentially on their distances , this system can be described by a hamiltonian of the type @xmath6 with couplings of the form @xmath7 the eigenvalues of the system for a given value of @xmath0 are given by @xmath8 with the corresponding eigenstates @xmath9 where @xmath10 . for convenience , and in analogy to the quantum case , we will refer to these eigenvalues and eigenstates as _ instantaneous _ eigenenergies and eigenstates in the following .",
    "an example of the instantaneous eigenvalues of this system is depicted in the left panel in fig .",
    "the right panel shows the components of the instantaneous eigenstate @xmath11 corresponding to the zero energy eigenvalue . as in the conventional stirap scheme",
    ", @xmath11 varies from @xmath12 ( only populating the right waveguide ) at @xmath13 to @xmath14 ( only populating the left waveguide ) at @xmath15 for sufficiently large values of @xmath16 , for which @xmath17 thus , adiabatic parameter variation , which is given for sufficiently large values of @xmath18 in the present case , leads to a complete population transfer from the right to the left waveguide .",
    "furthermore , since the second component of @xmath11 is identically zero for all @xmath0 , the central waveguide is never significantly populated during the process .",
    "this has been experimentally demonstrated in the waveguide setup in @xcite .    ) , with the parameter dependence ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath19 .",
    "the right figure shows the squared absolute values of the components of the adiabatic eigenstate @xmath11 ( first , second , and third component shown in blue , green , and red , respectively).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=23.5% ] ) , with the parameter dependence ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath19 .",
    "the right figure shows the squared absolute values of the components of the adiabatic eigenstate @xmath11 ( first , second , and third component shown in blue , green , and red , respectively).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=23.5% ]      let us now consider the transfer probability in more detail .",
    "we wish to adiabatically follow the state @xmath11 , which corresponds approximately to the right waveguide at @xmath13 , that is , @xmath20 the transfer probability to the left waveguide at @xmath15 is defined by @xmath21 where the denominator is constant if there is no absorption , and can be set to unity .",
    "let us express the solution of the evolution equation ( [ eqn_evo ] ) as a sum of adiabatic and non - adiabatic parts in the instantaneous eigenbasis : @xmath22 where the absolute values of the nonadiabatic coefficients of the instantaneous states @xmath23 are equal due to the symmetry of the problem . on account of the relation @xmath24 , the transfer probability in eq .",
    "( [ eqn_transprob_def ] ) can be estimated as @xmath25 again , if there is no absorption in the system , the denominator is equal to unity if the initial wave function is normalised .",
    "the dynamical equations for the coefficients @xmath26 directly follow from ( [ eqn_evo ] ) as @xmath27 with the initial conditions @xmath28 the bar denotes complex conjugation distinguishing left and right eigenvectors for the symmetric possibly non - hermitian hamiltonian to be considered in the following . in that case the geometric phase is included in the eigenvectors by using the normalisation condition @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "if there is no absorption the hamiltonian under consideration is real symmetric , and the instantaneous eigenstates can be chosen real ; thus no complex conjugation is required . for the hamiltonian ( [ eq_ham ] ) the equations ( [ new4 ] ) explicitly read @xmath30 with @xmath31 , which depends on @xmath0 . for large values of l",
    "the non - adiabatic coupling constant @xmath32 is small for all values of @xmath0 , and reaches its maximal value at @xmath33 .     for @xmath19 ( blue solid line ) . for comparison also",
    "the estimation based on equation ( [ eq10 ] ) is shown ( black dashed line).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the nonadiabatic transition probability can be obtained by a numerical integration .",
    "the result is depicted in a semilogarithmic plot as a function of @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , for @xmath19 .",
    "while there is an approximate exponential decay initially , at a critical value of @xmath18 the transition probability begins to oscillate around an only slowly decreasing mean value .",
    "similar behaviour is typically observed in stirap schemes @xcite .",
    "the initial exponential decay of the non - adiabatic transition probability in fig . [ fig2 ] can be estimated by a landau - zener type argument as @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the position of the exceptional point , where @xmath36 or @xmath37 , nearest to the real @xmath0-axis @xcite . since @xmath38",
    ", exceptional points appear as triple degeneracies ( ep3 ) with @xmath39 , corresponding to complex values of @xmath0 given by the equation @xmath40 . using ( [ eq2 ] )",
    ", we find that they are located at @xmath41 the ep3 with the smallest positive imaginary part of @xmath0 is @xmath35 . from @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ", we can compute the integral in ( [ eq8 ] ) as @xmath44 this estimate is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a dashed black line .",
    "it can be seen that it provides a good approximation for the initial decrease of the transition probability with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "the saturation of the transition probability with larger values of @xmath18 is due to the fact that the landau - zener approximation assumes a vanishing coupling at the beginning and the end of the `` time evolution '' ( i.e. at @xmath13 and @xmath15 , respectively ) , which is not the case in the stirap scheme investigated here .    in summary",
    ", the transfer probability ( [ eqn_transprob ] ) is very close to unity as long as @xmath18 is large . in the following",
    "we will see how the scheme can break down in the presence of losses , even though the non - adiabatic transitions stay small .",
    "the adiabatic theorem states that a system initially prepared in an eigenstate remains in the corresponding instantaneous eigenstate if the system parameters are varied infinitely slowly and the corresponding energy level is nondegenerate at all times . for finite parameter variations ,",
    "there are small transition amplitudes between the adiabatic states , which are typically of order @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the small adiabatic parameter @xcite .",
    "we have seen for the stirap scheme in waveguides investigated here , that indeed the non - adiabatic transitions are negligible for large values of @xmath18 . in the presence of absorption , however , this alone does not guarantee adiabatic evolution .",
    "this is due to the fact , that absorption leads to complex eigenvalues , that is , the amplitudes of the instantaneous eigenstates are themselves exponentially decreasing in time .",
    "this can lead to a situation in which the small nonadiabatic transition amplitude grows exponentially in time relative to the adiabatic amplitude , if the adiabatic state is not the one with the smallest decay rate . in other words ,",
    "the effect is caused by the dominance of the single gain mode of the time evolution operator @xcite .",
    "we will now demonstrate how this general phenomenon can lead to a breakdown of the adiabatic population transfer in our waveguide system , if one of the waveguides has an additional absorption .",
    "note that this does not rule out the existence of a modified transfer scheme which could lead to a total population transfer in the presence of absorption .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for investigations of such alternative schemes in the context of cavity qed .",
    "the case of absorption in the central waveguide is well studied in the context of the original stirap scheme , and it is straight forward to show , that it does not influence the transition probability significantly . intuitively this can be understood by realizing that the adiabatic state @xmath11 is not affected by the additional decay , and thus , does not populate the central waveguide at any instant . for moderate absorption the non - adiabatic coupling elements are not altered and thus the system will simply not feel the absorption in the unpopulated state in a first order approximation . in the following",

    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the boundary given by ( [ new16 ] ) together with the results of direct numerical simulation , confirming the validity of our derivation .",
    "the deviation for smaller values of @xmath18 is due to the fact , that the assumption of the only relevant non - adiabatic transitions occurring for small values of @xmath55 is only justified for sufficiently large values of @xmath18 .",
