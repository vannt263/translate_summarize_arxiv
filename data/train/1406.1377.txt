    "compressible two and multi phase flows occur in nature as well as in numerous industrial applications . in many cases phase transitions between the fluids are of major importance .",
    "examples are the formation of clouds or the phenomenon of cavitation that for instance appears in liquid water flows around ship propellers .",
    "the modeling of such processes is a challenge .",
    "the description of the interfaces between the fluids as well as their interaction is of high complexity .",
    "therefore in the spotlight of the methods is the treatment of the interfaces .",
    "many numerical simulations are based on the euler equations of compressible fluid flow .",
    "we will direct our attention to two phase models of this type that take into account mass transfer between the fluids .    very famous",
    "are the models of baer - nunziato type . here",
    "both phases are described by their own set of euler equations .",
    "an additional equation for the volume fractions of the phases is considered , see section [ s : moddis ] .",
    "the original model of baer and nunziato @xcite , that does not include the effect of mass exchange between the phases , was modified by saurel and abgrall in @xcite by introducing relaxation terms for pressures and velocities of the phases .",
    "later in @xcite a similar idea allowed the description of phase transition by using relaxation terms for the temperatures and chemical potentials .",
    "this idea was picked up for instance by petitpas et al .  in @xcite or by zein et al . in @xcite .",
    "another type of modeling of two phase flows is to use only one set of euler equations .",
    "each phase has its own equation of state .",
    "phase transitions can be described by a further equation that is called kinetic relation .",
    "see for instance the well reputed article of abeyaratne and knowles @xcite that deals with solid - solid interfaces , the papers of merkle @xcite or hantke et al .",
    "@xcite on the isothermal euler equations .",
    "finally we want to refer to a recent paper of dumbser et al .  @xcite . in their work",
    "also only one set of equations is used .",
    "phase transitions take place only in thermal equilibrium , no kinetic relation is used .",
    "surprisingly this type of modeling is closely related to the baer - nunziato type modeling mentioned above including relaxation terms to describe mass transfer .",
    "we come back to this and the abovementioned models later in section [ s : moddis ] .    one can find an extensive literature on cavitating flows , but the opposite question of the creation of a liquid phase by a strong compression is discussed only in rare cases . in the following we consider pure water vapor , that will be highly compressed .",
    "this can be realized by a steam filled tube with a flexible piston , see figure [ comkolb ] .",
    "if there is no heat exchange with the neighbourhood of the tube , the process is nearly an adiabatic flow .",
    "therefore it can be fairly described by the compressible euler equations .",
    "one may expect , that it is possible to compress the vapor phase such that the vapor will condensate .",
    "this means that a liquid phase is created .",
    "in fact , it turns out this is impossible in a non - isothermal approach based on euler equations , which is in agreement with observations from experiments .",
    "the main focus of our work is to give a * mathematical proof for this phenomenon*.    in the case of expanding a liquid under the same boundary conditions , see figure [ expkolb ] the situation is more complex .",
    "nevertheless , also for the cavitation case we can prove some theoretical results . for detailed discussions of cavitation models we refer to iben @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s : eulergl ]",
    "we introduce the compressible euler equations and briefly recall some well - known analytical results on the riemann problem . afterwards in section [ s : eos ] we give some equations of state to close the system and provide some physical background .",
    "section [ s : nucl ] deals with compressed water vapor .",
    "first in section [ s : idea ] we explain the idea for the proof of our statement . in section [ s : spec ] we show for a special choice of equations of state for the phases , that condensation by compression can not occur .",
    "after that in section [ s : moddis ] we show , that this idea is also applicable to baer - nunziato type models with relaxation terms as in saurel et al .",
    "@xcite , zein et al .",
    "thereafter , in section [ s : exteos ] we generalize the proof to the _ real equation of state for water_. finally we consider the opposite case of cavitation by expansion in section [ s : cav ] .",
    "we end up with some closing remarks in section [ s : clos ] .",
    "the compressible euler equations in one space dimension are given by the following system @xmath0u&=&0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the variables @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the _ mass density _ , the _ velocity _ and the _ internal energy _ , resp .",
    "the further quantity @xmath4 describes the _",
    "pressure_. it is related to the mass density @xmath1 and the internal energy @xmath3 by an _ equation of state _ , see section [ s : eos ] .",
    "all physical fields depend on time @xmath5 and on space @xmath6 .    here",
    "we consider riemann problems for the euler equations , that are given by the above balance equations ( [ e : mb])-([e : eb ] ) , an equation of state and the corresponding _ riemann initial data _",
    "@xmath7 this is the simplest choice of initial conditions with piecewise constant data .",
    "it is possible and conventional to give initial states for @xmath8 or @xmath9 instead of initial states for @xmath10 .",
    "also other choices are imaginable .",
    "the riemann problem is very helpful in the context of hyperbolic partial differential systems , because it exhibits all phenomena as shock or rarefaction waves .",
    "it is a basic problem in the theory of hyperbolic systems . in numerics",
    "riemann problems appear in finite volume methods for systems of conservation laws due to the discreteness of the grid .",
    "for the riemann problem for the compressible euler equations equipped with an appropriate equation of state one can construct the exact solution .",
    "the solution is selfsimilar .",
    "it consists of constant states , that are separated by shock and rarefaction waves and a contact discontinuity .",
    "details can be found in several textbooks . for basics on conservation laws",
    "see the books of toro @xcite , lax @xcite , leveque @xcite , smoller @xcite , krner @xcite , dafermos @xcite , and others .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section we need an equation of state to close the system ( [ e : mb])-([e : eb ] ) .",
    "several commonly accepted equations of state are available like the van der waals equation of state or the tait s equation .",
    "a collective problem is that for any choice of parameters all these equations at the best only locally give a good approximation of the thermodynamic properties of water vapor or liquid water .    on the other hand , the real equation of state for water to the official standard _ iapws - if97 _ based on the standard formulation of wagner et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite is too complex for analytical consideration . in the following this equation of state",
    "is called _ real equation of state_.    for the moment we use a modified form of the stiffened gas equation of state , see @xcite .",
    "it is given by the following relations @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the _ temperature _ and the _ specific entropy _ of the fluid .",
    "the speed of sound is given by @xmath14 .",
    "the index @xmath15 indicates the fluid under consideration , vapor or liquid .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 will be specified later .",
    "note , that for the special choice of @xmath21 and @xmath22 the equation of state reduces to the ideal gas law .    for the physical background of the following considerations and more details on thermodynamics we refer to the books of mller and mller @xcite and mller @xcite .",
    "the _ specific gibbs free energy _ of the phases is given by @xmath23 if the vapor and the liquid phase are in thermodynamic equilibrium the gibbs free energies equal each other , this means that @xmath24 using the relations ( [ e : eos - e])-([e : eos - s ] ) the gibbs free energy of each phase can be expressed as a function of the temperature and the pressure @xmath25 then the equilibrium condition ( [ eqcon ] ) gives a direct relation between the temperature and the corresponding equilibrium pressure or _ saturation pressure _ @xmath26 this relation gives the _ saturation line _ in the @xmath27-phase space .",
    "sometimes it is useful to inversly express the temperature as a function of the pressure @xmath28 for admissible pressures we obtain the corresponding _",
    "saturation temperature_.    for the moment we use the same parameters as saurel et al .",
    "these parameters are given in table [ tab : para ] .",
    ".parameters for water vapor and liquid water , @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for this special choice of parameters we obtain the saturation curve given by the solid line in figure [ fig : sat ] .        here",
    "region 1 belongs to the liquid water phase , whereas region 2 belongs to the water vapor .",
    "the dashed line marks the real saturation line .",
    "obviously the precise shape of the saturation line directly depends on the choice for the equations of state and the parameters therein",
    ".    note that for a thermodynamic consistent equation of state the following relations hold @xmath29 these relations will be used for the proof of our statement .",
    "at first we consider the case of the compression of water vapor .",
    "this case can be simulated by a steam filled tube equipped with a flexible piston , which is highly sped up to compress the vapor phase , see figure [ comkolb ] .",
    "the compression of water vapor will lead to an increase of the pressure and the density of the vapor phase . from the theory of the euler equations we know , that a shock wave will propagate through the vapor phase .",
    "assume that the state ahead of the shock is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the state behind the shock is denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "then we have the following relationship for the density and the pressure @xmath33 for details of the derivation of relation ( [ e : p_rho ] ) we recommend the book of toro @xcite , section 3.1 .",
    "note , that this relation holds only for the generalized stiffened gas law ( [ e : eos - e])-([e : eos - s ] ) . using the equation of state ( [ e : eos - t ] )",
    "we easily obtain an analogous relation for the pressure and the temperature , which is given by @xmath34 from equation ( [ e : p_t ] ) we find the wave curve @xmath35 in the @xmath30-phase space , that denotes all states @xmath36 that can be connected to the initial state @xmath37 by a shock wave .",
    "assume that the vapor phase with initial pressure and temperature @xmath38 is compressed sufficiently such that a liquid phase is created , then the corresponding wave curve @xmath35 must have an intersection point with the saturation line , see the sketch in figure [ fig : nucl ] .",
    "we want to prove that this is impossible . for the proof",
    "we assume the existence of the intersection point and derive a contradiction .",
    "assume , the intersection point of the wave curve and the saturation line is given by @xmath36 .",
    "then the function @xmath39 denotes all admissible initial states @xmath38 .",
    "here we already used the fact that for the vapor phase we have @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath40 denote the derivative of the temperature functions with respect to the pressure . at the intersection point the following relation must hold @xmath41 by a simple calculation we find @xmath42 to find @xmath43 we start with the equilibrium condition ( [ eqcon ] ) and express the gibbs free energies of the phases as functions of @xmath4 and @xmath12 .",
    "we obtain @xmath44 with @xmath45 . from @xmath46",
    "we derive by using the implicit function theorem @xmath47 and finally @xmath48 this is clear because @xmath49    obviously ( [ e : abl2 ] ) implies @xmath50 this is a contradiction , see ( [ e : intrel ] ) .",
    "accordingly we have    [ n_sp ] using the equations of state ( [ e : eos - e])-([e : eos - s ] ) and the parameters given in table [ tab : para ] condensation by compression of pure water vapor can not occur .      in the following paragraph",
    "we explain , why the proof of our statement given in section [ s : spec ] resp.in section [ s : exteos ] is applicable for all considered models based on euler equations .",
    "a pure water vapor phase can be described by a single set of euler equations .",
    "the compression leads to an increase of the density and the pressure as already mentioned in the previous section .",
    "one may assume that for sufficiently strong compression the vapor phase starts to condensate .",
    "this means , that a liquid phase is created .    of course , for any state @xmath30 which is in the interior of region 2 ( water vapor ) , the vapor phase is situated in a stable state . in order that phase condensation can happen , there must be a mechanism for phase transition .",
    "therefore , it is clear that in the case of condensation the wave curve , see the next to last section , must have an intersection point with the saturation line . for this it does nt matter , whether phase transition is modeled by a kinetic relation @xcite , @xcite or by using an equilibrium assumption as done in @xcite .    using a kinetic relation ,",
    "a nucleation criterion is used , see @xcite . here a critical state is reached , in which the vapor phase starts to condensate , which implies the intersection point .    in dumbser et al .",
    "@xcite phase transition is modeled by an equilibrium assumption . for",
    "any given temperature @xmath12 and @xmath51 the pair @xmath27 describes some vapor state .",
    "analogously @xmath27 with @xmath52 describes the fluid in the liquid state . for @xmath53",
    "one may have water vapor or liquid water as well as a mixture of both fluids .",
    "the fluid at the saturation state is defined by its temperature and the mass fraction or equivalently by its pressure and the mass fraction of the vapor / liquid phase .",
    "all corresponding states in the @xmath30-phase plane are located at the saturation line . for more details",
    "see iben et al .",
    "nevertheless , for condensation a wave curve must have an intersection point with the saturation line .",
    "the euler equations are only valid for pure fluids or homogeneous mixtures in the thermodynamic equilibrium . for models that use only one set of euler equations as discussed before pure fluid",
    "are present . on the other hand in literatur often models of baer - nunziato type",
    "are used to describe the situation considered .",
    "the generalized baer - nunziato model is given by a two phase model using two sets of euler equations @xmath54u_k&=&\\mp",
    "p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\alpha_k\\pm e\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath55 and a further equation to describe the volume fractions of the phases @xmath56 with the same notations as before .",
    "further , @xmath57 denotes the volumefraction of phase @xmath58 .",
    "the sources @xmath59 on the right hand side of the equations describe the exchange of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "they include relaxation terms for velocity , pressure , temperature and gibbs free energy of the phases , that guarantee , that both phases relax to thermodynamic equilibrium . the pressure @xmath60 und the velocity @xmath61 have to be defined by some closure law , see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "again we start with a pure vapor phase , that will be compressed .",
    "for numerical reasons the volume fraction of the pure phase is assumed to be @xmath62 , whereas the volume fraction of the absent phase is assumed to be @xmath63 .",
    "typically one uses @xmath64 , see for instance saurel and abgrall @xcite .",
    "mass transfer is described by the gibbs free energy relaxation term .",
    "condensation will occur only in the case , that the specific gibbs free energy of the vapor phase is larger than the specific gibbs free energy of the ( artificial ) liquid phase .",
    "this is not the case for any set of initial data that describes a pure water vapor phase .",
    "therefore there is no contribution by the relaxation terms as long as @xmath27 is in the interior of region 2 ( vapor phase ) .    in regions of constant volume fractions",
    "the system decouples .",
    "the solution for each phase can be determined separately .",
    "this implies that the relations of the single phase euler equations are also valid for the baer nunziato model in the case considered .",
    "in order that condensation can occur the vapor phase must be compressed in such a manner that the specific gibbs free energy of the vapor phase is larger than the specific gibbs free energy of the ( artificial ) liquid phase .",
    "this implies an intersection point of the wave curve with the saturation line .",
    "in the previous section [ s : nucl ] we have proved , that condensation by compression can not occur for the chosen equations of state with parameters given in table [ tab : para ] . on the other hand , in figure [ fig : sat ] we can see , that this choice gives a very bad approximation of the real saturation curve for higher temperatures .",
    "we now generalize our statement using the results from the last section .",
    "we want to show , that for the _ real equation of state _ and for _ good _ approximations of the real equation of state condensation by compression can not occur .",
    "the proof uses the same arguments as before .",
    "we start with an arbitrary initial state in the vapor region and we consider the corresponding wave curve .",
    "assume , @xmath36 is the intersection point of the curve @xmath65 of all admissible initial states in the @xmath30-phase space with the real saturation line @xmath66 .",
    "we compare the derivatives and find the contradiction .      for our purpose",
    "it is sufficient to find a good approximation of the real equation of state in a small neighborhood of the saturation line . in the following",
    "we show how to find suitable parameters , coming from the intersection point @xmath36 .",
    "this is an improvement of the method of le metayer et al .",
    "@xcite , which is a modification of the idea introduced by barberon and helluy @xcite .",
    "for any temperature @xmath67 the corresponding ( real ) saturation pressure is known by the real formulas given by wagner @xcite , @xcite . the same is true for the corresponding vapor density @xmath68 , the speed of sound @xmath69 , the entropy @xmath70 and the internal energy @xmath71 . for simplicity",
    "we choose @xmath72 .",
    "then from ( [ e : eos - a ] ) we directly obtain @xmath73 .",
    "next we calculate @xmath74 from ( [ e : eos - e ] ) , @xmath75 from ( [ e : eos - t ] ) and @xmath76 from ( [ e : eos - s ] ) .",
    "the results are given in figure [ fig : vap_para ] .",
    "for the liquid phase we disclaim the simplifying assumption for the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly we are looking for 5 parameters . therefore beside the relations ( [ e : eos - e ] ) - ( [ e : eos - s ] ) we can use a further relation . from thermodynamics",
    "it is known , that @xmath77 with the _ specific heat capacity at constant pressure_. using ( [ e : eos - s ] ) , ( [ e : eos - t ] ) and ( [ e : eos - e ] ) we find that @xmath78 this gives us the further relation @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the specific heat capacity at constant pressure of the liquid phase .",
    "again we use the real equation of state to obtain the liquid density @xmath81 , the speed of sound @xmath82 , the entropy @xmath83 , the internal energy @xmath84 as well as the specific heat capacity @xmath85 . then from ( [ e : eos - cp ] ) we find @xmath86 . after that we calculate @xmath87 and @xmath88 from ( [ e : eos - e ] ) and ( [ e : eos - a ] ) .",
    "finally we obtain @xmath89 from equation ( [ e : eos - t ] ) and @xmath90 from equation ( [ e : eos - s ] ) .",
    "the results are given in figure [ fig : liq_para ] .",
    "+   + using the parameters @xmath91 obtained in sections [ parv ] and [ parl ] the equations of state ( [ e : eos - e])-([e : eos - s ] ) give the exact values for the densities , the internal energies , the entropies and the sound speeds at saturation state @xmath36 .",
    "also we obtain the exact values for the gibbs free energies and the enthalpies . from equations ( [ e : gibbsrel])@xmath92 and ( [ e : gibbsrel])@xmath93 as well as equation ( [ e : f ] ) and the implicit function theorem we see , that we also find the exact value @xmath94 due to the smoothness of all expressions for any given tolerance @xmath95 we find a sufficiently small neighborhood of the saturation state @xmath36 such that all relevant physical states @xmath96 are approximated with a deviation less then @xmath63 .",
    "assume , for any initial state in the vapor region , that is close to the saturation line , the corresponding wave curve in the @xmath97-phase space and the ( real ) saturation line have the intersection point @xmath36 .",
    "assume further , that we used the optimal parameters @xmath91 , such that the equations of state ( [ e : eos - e])-([e : eos - s ] ) give the exact values for @xmath96 for both phases at saturation state @xmath36 .",
    "then the following relation must hold at the intersection point @xmath98 as before @xmath65 denotes all admissible initial states @xmath38 in the vapor region , in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath36 . for the derivative we have @xmath99 moreover",
    ", we have @xmath100 in both equations ( [ e : abl5 ] ) and ( [ e : abl6 ] ) we used the local optimal parameters .",
    "as already explained at the end of section [ approx ] , equation ( [ e : abl6 ] ) gives the exact value for the derivative .",
    "simple estimations show , that @xmath101 accordingly , there is no such intersection point . due to the smoothness of all expressions and the exactness of ( [ e : abl6 ] ) this statement is true for the real equation of state and for all sufficiently good approximations of the real equation of state .",
    "if there is any set of parameters @xmath91 such that ( [ e : abl7 ] ) is not satisfied , then the parameters obviously give a coarse approximation of the saturation line and the result is not meaningful .",
    "the same is true for any other choice of equations of state for the liquid and the vapor phase .",
    "we summarize    [ n_allg ] using the real equations of state @xcite or any good approximation of the real equation of state nucleation by compression can not occur .",
    "after the discussion of condensation by compression one may ask for the opposite case of cavitation by expansion .",
    "we will see , that this process is more complicated and we will distinguish between two cases .",
    "the liquid phase will be expanded in a manner that phase transition will occur .",
    "this case corresponds to a cavitation tube , which is a tube filled with liquid water and a flexible piston , see figure [ expkolb ] .        to illustrate the physics we give the @xmath102-diagram in figure [ sdia ] , where the path ( 1 ) corresponds to the process considered .",
    "we have seen , that the baer nunziato type relaxation model allows the coexistence of both the vapor and the liquid phase in the same point of the physical domain at the saturation state .",
    "the same is true for the eulerian model used by dumbser et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the phase transition is modeled by an equilibrium assumption .",
    "the mixture is called _",
    "wet steam_. an expansion process such that a mixture of water vapor and liquid water ( wet steam ) is created , we call the process * weak cavitation*. on the other hand , if pure water vapor is created , we call this process * strong cavitation*.      if the liquid phase is expanded , a rarefaction wave will propagate through the liquid phase . in analogy to the condensation case",
    "we start with an arbitrary set of initial data in the liquid phase ( region 1 ) .",
    "we construct the wave curve , that connects the initial state to all possible states behind the rarefaction wave . if ( weak ) cavitation , by sufficiently strong expansion , can occur this wave curve must have an intersection point with the saturation line .",
    "it is not surprising , that this is usually the case .",
    "numerous examples can be found in the literature , see for instance the example _",
    "cavitation by strong rarefaction _ using one set of euler equations and the equilibrium assumption in dumbser et al .",
    "@xcite . see further the _ expansion tube problem _ in zein et al .",
    "@xcite using the baer nunziato type relaxation model .      for the moment",
    "we restrict ourselves to the two model types , that allow the coexistence of vapor and liquid , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "models , using a kinetic relation will be discussed later .",
    "one may assume that for sufficiently strong expansions one may create pure water vapor . to illustrate that situation we refer to figure [ fig : cavwc ] .",
    "because region 3 , the wet steam region , reduces to a single line in the @xmath30 phase plan , we now plot all the data in the more descriptive @xmath103 phase plane .",
    "the wet steam region is bounded by the saturation ( solid ) lines .",
    "assume , there is any initial liquid state , marked by the star and assume further , the liquid is expanded in a manner that pure water vapor is created .",
    "this state is indicated by the circle .",
    "then there is a rarefaction wave curve , connecting the star and the circle state .",
    "this wave curve crosses the two curves @xmath104 .        the same situation in the @xmath30 phase plane",
    "is given in figure [ fig : cav_sk ] . in the following",
    "we will show , that strong cavitation for the models considered can not occur .",
    "the argument is similar to the argument in the condensation case .",
    "assume , the circle state exists .",
    "this implies the existence of a rarefaction wave curve that connects both the circle and the star state .",
    "the intersection point of the wave curve and the saturation curve @xmath66 in the @xmath30 phase plane is called @xmath36 .",
    "let us consider that part of the wave curve , that is located in the vapor in region 2 .",
    "we denote this curve by @xmath105 . as before for the intersection point we must have @xmath106    the wave curve is found to be @xmath107 this directly follows from equation ( [ e : eos - s ] ) and the fact , that the entropy is constant across a rarefaction wave . equation ( [ wcrf ] ) implies @xmath108 this gives a contradiction , see ( [ e : abl5 ] ) and ( [ e : abl7 ] ) .",
    "using the real equation of state or any good approximation of the real equation of state strong cavitation by expansion can not occur in an approach based on euler equations and an equilibrium assumption , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is an alternative , very simple argument to show , that a pure liquid state and a pure water vapor state can not be connected by a rarefaction wave .",
    "as already mentioned it is a well known fact , that the entropy is constant across a rarefaction wave .",
    "but it is also known , that for any temperature between triple point temperature and critical temperature @xmath109 the entropies satisfy the inequalities @xmath110 obviously there are no liquid and vapor states with the same entropy .",
    "this also can be seen in figure [ sdia ] .    using an eulerian approach like dumbser et al .",
    "@xcite one can obtain only weak cavitation .",
    "wet steam is created , which is a mixture of water vapor and liquid water at saturation state . for",
    "the entropy one has @xmath111 where @xmath112 $ ] denotes the vapor mass fraction , see @xcite .",
    "due to equation ( [ entropy ] ) the value @xmath113 is bounded for cavitation starting from pure liquid water . using the steam tables of wagner @xcite we find @xmath114    in contrast to the equilibrium models discussed in the first part of section [ strongcav ] models using a kinetic relation are able to produce strong cavitation .",
    "this is clear by section [ weakcav ] .",
    "a rarefaction wave curve in the liquid region 1 can have an intersection point with the saturation line . here",
    "a critical state is reached .",
    "a cavitation criterion can be used , see hantke et al .",
    "the liquid phase starts to evaporate and a pure vapor phase is created .",
    "an important difference to the previous models is , that the solution is nonsmooth and entropy production by phase transition is allowed .",
    "therefore there is no contradiction to previous results .",
    "we have seen , that condensation by compression can not occur in an eulerian approach . due to the compression of the water vapor not only the pressure but also the temperature is increasing . because of the temperature rise the saturation pressure is increasing .",
    "the key point is , that the saturation pressure increases much faster than the pressure inside the vapor phase .",
    "therefore phase transition can not take place . from observations of nearly adiabatic flows ,",
    "see figure [ expkolb ] , [ comkolb ] this phenomenon is known .",
    "* the euler equations correctly reflect this behavior .",
    "we gave a mathematical proof for this .",
    "* adiabatic compression of vapor does not lead to liquid phase , see figure [ sdia ] , path ( 1 ) . to reach this state",
    ", negative heat flow has to be used .",
    "this is equivalent to the use of isothermal euler equations such as done by hantke et .",
