    "the prevalence of infrared emission from accretion disks around young stars is consistent with the idea that such disks are ubiquitous .",
    "their disappearance on a time scale of 50 to 100 million years suggests that the dust and gas accrete into planetesimals and eventually planets ( haisch 2001 ) .",
    "such observations support the widely accepted idea that planet formation is a common by - product of star formation ( e.g. beckwith 2000 ) . in the standard model of planet formation , earth - like planets accrete near the host star from rocky debris depleted of volatile elements , while giant gaseous planets accrete in the ice zones ( @xmath3 au ) around rocky cores ( lissauer 1995 , boss 1995 ) .",
    "when the rocky cores in the ice zones reach a critical mass ( @xmath4 ) runaway gaseous accretion ( formation of jupiters ) begins and continues until gaps form in the protoplanetary disk or the disk dissipates ( papaloizou & terquem 1999 , habing 1999 ) , leaving one or more jupiter - like planets at @xmath5 au .",
    "we can not yet determine how generic the pattern described above is .",
    "however , formation of terrestrial planets is thought to be less problematic than the formation of jupiter - like planets ( wetherill 1995 ) .",
    "gas in circumstellar disks around young stars is lost within a few million years and it is not obvious that the rocky cores necessary to accrete the gas into a jupiter can form on that time scale ( zuckerman 1995 ) .",
    "thus , jupiter - like planets may be rare .",
    "planets may not form at all if erosion , rather than growth , occurs during collisions of planetesimals ( kortenkamp & wetherill 2000 ) .",
    "the present day asteroid belt may be an example of such non - growth .",
    "in addition , not all circumstellar disks produce an extant planetary system .",
    "some fraction may spawn a transitory system only to be accreted by the central star along with the disk ( ward 1997 ) .",
    "also , observations of star - forming regions indicate that massive stars disrupt the protoplanetary disks around neighboring lower mass stars , aborting their efforts to produce planets ( henney & odell 1999 ) . given these uncertainties , whether planetary systems like our solar system",
    "are common around sun - like stars and whether jupiter - like planets are typical of such planetary systems , are important open questions .",
    "the frequency of jupiter - like planets may also have implications for the frequency of life in the universe .",
    "a jupiter - like planet shields inner planets from an otherwise much heavier bombardment by planetesimals , comets and asteroids during the first billion years after formation of the central star .",
    "wetherill ( 1994 ) has estimated that jupiter significantly reduced the frequency of sterilizing impacts on the early earth during the important epoch @xmath6 billion years ago when life originated on earth .",
    "the removal of comet shoemaker - levy by jupiter in 1994 , is a more recent example of jupiter s protective role .    to date",
    "( november , 2001 ) , @xmath7 giant planets ( @xmath8 ) in close orbits ( @xmath9 ) around 66 nearby stars have been detected by measuring the doppler reflex of the host star ( marcy 2001 , mayor 2001 ) .",
    "seven stars are host to multiple planets ( six doubles , one triple system ) .",
    "approximately 5% of the sun - like stars surveyed possess such giant planets ( marcy & butler 2000 ) .",
    "the large masses , small orbits , high eccentricities and high host metallicities of these 74 exoplanets was not anticipated by theories of planet formation that were largely based on the assumption that planetary systems are ubiquitous and our solar system is typical ( lissauer 1995 ) .",
    "naef ( 2001 ) point out that none of the planetary companions detected so far resembles the giants of the solar system .",
    "this observational fact however , is fully consistent with the idea that our solar system is a typical planetary system",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] shows explicitly that selection effects can easily explain the lack of detections of jupiter - like planets .",
    "exoplanets detected to date can not resemble the planets of our solar system because the doppler technique used to detect exoplanets has not been sensitive enough to detect jupiter - like planets . if the sun were a target star in one of the doppler surveys , no planet would have been detected around it .",
    "this situation is about to change . in the next few years",
    "doppler planet searches will be making detections in the region of parameter space occupied by jupiter .",
    "thus    it is timely to use the current data to estimate how densely occupied that parameter space will be .",
    "the detected exoplanets may well be the observable @xmath10 tail of the main concentration of massive planets of which jupiter is typical . the main goal of this paper is to correct or account for selection effects to the extent possible and then examine what the trends in the mass and period distributions indicate for the region of parameter space near jupiter .",
    "such an analysis is now possible because a statistically significant sample is starting to emerge from which we can determine meaningful distributions in mass , period as well as in eccentricity and metallicity .",
    "our analysis helps answer the important question : how does our planetary system compare to other planetary systems ?    in the next section we present our method for identifying a less biased subsample of exoplanets . in section [ sec : pmplane ] we identify and extrapolate the trends in mass and period . in section [",
    "sec : discuss ] we discuss our analysis and compare our results to previous work . in section [ sec : summary ]",
    "we summarize our results .",

    ", its host star must be doppler - monitored regularly for a period @xmath12 greater than or comparable to the orbital period @xmath13 of the planet .",
    "thus , one selection effect on the detection of exoplanets is p_obs p. [ eq : p ] the relationship between the observable line - of - sight velocity of the host star , @xmath14 , the mass of the planet , @xmath15 , the mass of the host star , @xmath16 , the velocity of the planet , @xmath17 , and the semi - major axis of the the planet s orbit , @xmath18 , is obtained by combining @xmath19 $ ] ( where @xmath20 is orbital eccentricity ) with momentum conservation , @xmath21 , and kepler s third law @xmath22 ( in the limits that @xmath23 , and where @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath13 are measured in solar masses , au and years respectively ) . simultaneously solving these equations yields the induced line - of - sight velocity of the host star , k = 2 p^-1/3 .",
    "[ eq : k ]    this equation is used to find @xmath0 as a function of the doppler survey observables @xmath24 and @xmath20 , with @xmath16 estimated from stellar spectra . to detect an exoplanet",
    ", the radial velocity @xmath25 must be greater than the instrumental noise , @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the doppler technique is most sensitive to massive close - orbiting planets .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] shows that we are now on the verge of being able to detect planetary systems like ours , i.e. , jupiter - mass planets at @xmath3 au from nearby host stars .",
    "the grey regions of fig . [ fig : massperiodesp ] partition the parameter space and represent the selection effects of the doppler surveys .",
    "we use these partitions to identify a less biased subsample of 44 exoplanets within the rectangular area enclosed by the thick solid line .    the largest observed @xmath13 and the smallest observed @xmath25 of the exoplanets in fig . [ fig : massperiodesp ]",
    "are inserted into equations [ eq : p ] & [ eq : k ] to empirically define the boundary between the `` being detected '' and the `` not detected '' regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] . to define the `` detected '' region of parameter space",
    "in which virtually all planets should have been detected ( thus defining a less biased subsample of exoplanets ) we consider planets with @xmath27 years with @xmath28 m / s , that have been observed for more than 3 years with an instrumental noise @xmath29 m / s .",
    "the rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] is the largest rectanglar area that approximately fits inside the `` detected '' region .",
    "this method of cutting the data to remove biases is reminiscent of the astronomical practice of constructing a volume - limited sample from a magnitude - limited sample .",
    "the area within the rectangle subsumes the ranges @xmath30 days and @xmath31 and is subdivided into a minimum number of smaller areas ( 12 boxes ) for histogram binning convenience ( figs .",
    "[ fig : masshistogramfit ] & [ fig : periodhistogramfit ] ) .",
    "trends in @xmath32 and @xmath13 identified within this subsample are less biased than trends based on the full sample of exoplanets .    if jupiter is a typical giant planet , the region around jupiter in the @xmath33 plane of fig .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] will be more densely occupied than other regions  the density of planets in the lower right will be larger than in the upper left .",
    "although we are dealing with small number statistics , that trend is the main identifiable trend in fig . [",
    "fig : massperiodesp ] ; the number of exoplanets in the boxes increases from left to right and top to bottom . in the rest of the paper we quantify and extrapolate these trends into the lower mass bin and longer period bin enclosed by the dotted rectangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] .      within the rectangle enclosed by the thick solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] , two boxes in the lower right lie partially in the `` being detected '' region .",
    "thus they are partially undersampled compared to the other boxes within the rectangle .",
    "we correct for this undersampling by making the simple assumption that the detection efficiency is linear in the `` being detected '' region .",
    "that is , we assume that the detection efficiency is @xmath34 in the `` detected '' region and @xmath35 in the `` not detected '' region and decreases linearly inbetween .",
    "this linear correction produces the `` + 1 '' and `` + 5 '' corrections to the number of exoplanets observed in these two boxes and produces the dotted corrections to the histograms in figs .",
    "[ fig : masshistogramesp ] , [ fig : masshistogramfit ] and [ fig : periodhistogramfit ] .",
    "eight new planets were detected while this paper was in preparation ( vogt 2002 , tinney 2002 ) .",
    "these are distinguished in fig .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] by crosses plotted over the dots .",
    "five of the eight justify our parameter space partitions by falling as expected , in the `` being detected '' region .",
    "the other three fall unexpectedly in the `` detected '' region .",
    "if this region were fully detected newly detected planets would not fall there .",
    "however , two of the three ( hd 68988 & hd 4203 , both with @xmath0 between 1.5 and 2 @xmath1 ) had only been observed for 1.5 years and therefore do not qualify for our least biased sample containing only host stars that have been monitored for at least three years .",
    "therefore , these two apparent anomalies do not undermine our parameter space partitions .",
    "the third host lying in the `` detected '' region lies near the `` being detected '' boundary .",
    "it has a two year period and was monitored for four years at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) ( tinney 2002 ) .",
    "its observed velocity of @xmath36 m / s made it a @xmath37 signal with the aat s @xmath38 m / s sensitivity .",
    "its appearance in the `` detected '' region may be ascribable to late reporting or may reflect the need to combine the constraints from eqs .",
    "[ eq : p ] & [ eq : k ] into a smooth curve rather than two straight boundaries .",
    "subsequent exoplanets can be similarly used to verify the accuracy of our representation of the doppler detection selection effects in the @xmath39 plane .",
    "the distribution of the masses of the exoplanets is shown against @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : masshistogramesp ] and against log @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : masshistogramfit ] . the 6 planet correction ( section [ sec : correction ] ) to the @xmath40 bin in both figures",
    "is indicated by the dotted lines . in fig .",
    "[ fig : masshistogramesp ] the solid curve and the enclosing dashed curves are the best fit and @xmath41 confidence levels of the functional form @xmath42 fit to the histogram of the corrected less - biased subsample ( 50 = 44 + 6 exoplanets ) .",
    "we find @xmath43 .",
    "this means , for example , that within the same period range there are @xmath44 times as many @xmath1 as @xmath45 exoplanets and similarly @xmath44 times as many @xmath46 as @xmath1 exoplanets .",
    "this slope is steeper than the @xmath47 of previous analyses ( section [ sec : compare ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : masshistogramfit ] the line is the best fit of the functional form @xmath48 to the histogram .",
    "the best - fit slope , @xmath49 , is significantly steeper than flat .",
    "the extrapolation of this trend into the adjacent lower mass bin ( @xmath50 ) indicates that at least @xmath51 exoplanets with periods in the range @xmath52 days are being hosted by the target stars now being monitored .",
    "since 13 have been detected to date in this mass range , we predict that @xmath53 more have yet to be detected .",
    "thus we predict that the continued monitoring of the target stars that produced the current set of exoplanets will eventually yield @xmath54 new planets in the parameter range @xmath55 days with @xmath50 ( dotted horizontal rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] ) .",
    "the trend of increasing number of exoplanets per box as one descends in mass does not hold true in the highly undersampled longest period bin ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the absence of this trend may be the result of small number statistics or an additional    hint that a smooth curve , rather than our two straight boundaries , more accurately describes the selection effects .",
    "extrapolation of the linear trend found in fig .",
    "[ fig : periodhistogramfit ] indicates that 22 new planets will be discovered in the first bin to the right of the rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] ( @xmath57 days in the mass range @xmath31 ) . following the trend in @xmath0 identified in fig .",
    "[ fig : masshistogramfit ] , these 22 should be preferencially assigned to the lower masses in this range .",
    "extrapolation of the trend in period into an even longer period bin , which would include saturn , is more problematic .",
    "a significant difference between the detected exoplanets and jupiter , is the high orbital eccentricities of the exoplanets .",
    "the eccentricities of the planets of our solar system were presumably constrained to small values ( @xmath58 ) by the migration through , and accretion of , essentially zero eccentricity disk material .",
    "a simple model that can explain the higher exoplanet eccentricities is that in higher metallicity systems , the higher abundance of refractory material in the protoplanetary disk may lead to the production of more planetary cores in the ice zone producing multiple jupiters which gravitationally scatter off each other .",
    "occasionnaly one will be scattered in closer to the central star and become doppler - detectable ( weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ) .",
    "if that is the origin of the hot jupiters , then the detected exoplanets may be the high metallicity tail of a distribution in which our solar system is typical , and as longer period giant planets are found they will have lower eccentricities , comparable to jupiter s and saturn s .",
    "thus , if jupiter is the norm rather than the exception , not only will we find more planets in the @xmath59 parameter space near jupiter as reported above , but also the eccentricities of the longer period exoplanets will be lower .",
    "the general distribution of the eccentricities of the exoplanets does not seem to reflect this , but exoplanets in planetary systems lend some support to the idea ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eccperiodesp ] and caption ) .      in this paper",
    "we have focused on the position of jupiter relative to the exoplanets .",
    "this relative comparison does not require a conversion of exoplanet @xmath0 values to @xmath15 values ( jorissen 2001 , zucker & mazeh 2001a , 2001b and tabachnik & tremaine 2001 ) .",
    "however , for this comparison jupiter s position needs to be lowered and spread out a bit . given a random distribution of orbital inclinations , the probability of @xmath61 , given @xmath15 , is p(y|m ) = . with @xmath62 , this probability is the curve placed outside the plotting area on the lower right of fig .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] .",
    "it represents the region of @xmath0 that jupiter - mass planets would fall in when observed at random orientations .",
    "the mean of this distribution is @xmath63 while the median is @xmath64 ( in units of @xmath1 ) .",
    "this lowers and spreads out in @xmath0 the position of jupiter but does not change the main results of the extrapolations done here .",
    "the functional form @xmath65 can be fit in various ways to various versions of the @xmath0 histogram of exoplanets . when the histogram of all 74 exoplanets is fit , including the highly undersampled lowest @xmath0 bin , the result is @xmath66 .",
    "this is reported in marcy 2001 and we confirm this result .",
    "this value for @xmath60 is close to the @xmath67 found for very low mass stars ( bejar 2001 ) .",
    "when the lowest exoplanet @xmath0 bin is ignored because of known incompleteness we obtain @xmath68 .",
    "this is very similar to the @xmath69 found in fits to the derived @xmath15 distribution ( zucker & mazeh 2001a , tabachnik & tremaine 2001 ) .",
    "the fit for @xmath60 seems to be more dependent on how the first bin is treated and how the sample for fitting is selected than on whether one fits to @xmath0 or @xmath15 .",
    "fitting to the @xmath0 histogram of the less biased sample of 44 exoplanets , uncorrected for undersampling , yields @xmath70 . after correcting for undersampling as described in section [ sec : correction ] we obtain our final result : @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : masshistogramesp ] ) . this slope is steeper than the @xmath47 of previous analyses and indicates that instead of @xmath1 mass exoplanets being twice as common as @xmath2 exoplanets , they are three times as common .",
    "despite the fact that massive planets are easier to detect , the mass distribution of detected planets is strongly peaked toward the lowest detectable masses . and despite the fact that short period planets are easier to detect , the period distribution is strongly peaked toward the longest detectable periods . to quantify these trends as accurately as possible ,",
    "we have identified a less - biased subsample of exoplanets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] ) . within this subsample",
    ", we have identified trends in @xmath0 and period that are less biased than trends based on the full sample of exoplanets .",
    "straightforward extrapolations of the trends quantified here , into the area of parameter space occupied by jupiter , indicates that jupiter lies in a region of parameter space densely occupied by exoplanets .",
    "our analysis indicates that 45 new planets will be detected in the parameter space discussed in the text .",
    "this estimate of 45 is a lower limit in the sense that if a smooth curve , rather than our two straight boundaries , more accurately describes the selection effects in fig [ fig : massperiodesp ] , larger corrections to the bin numbers would steepen the slopes in both fig .",
    "[ fig : masshistogramfit ] & [ fig : periodhistogramfit ] .    despite the importance of the mass distribution and the trends in it ,",
    "it is the trend in period that , when extrapolated , takes us to jupiter and the parameter space occupied by jupiter - like exoplanets ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : massperiodesp ] & [ fig : periodhistogramfit ] ) .",
    "long term slopes in the velocity data that have not yet been associated with planets are present in a large fraction of the target stars surveyed with the doppler technique ( butler , mayor private communication ) .",
    "however , quantifying the percentage of host stars showing such residual trends is difficult and depends on instrumental noise , phase coverage and the signal to noise threshold used to decide whether there is , or is not , a long term trend .",
    "figure [ fig : massperiodmore ] shows that the doppler technique has been able to sample a very specific high mass , short - period region of the @xmath71 plane .",
    "thus far , this sampled region does not overlap with the 10 times larger area of this plane occupied by the nine planets of our solar system .",
    "thus there is room in the @xmath72 of target stars with no doppler - detected planets , to harbour planetary systems like our solar system .",
    "the trends in the exoplanets detected thus far do not rule out the hypothesis that our solar system is typical .",
    "they support it .",
    "the extrapolations of the trends quantified here put jupiter in the most densely occupied region of the @xmath33 parameter space .",
    "our analysis suggests that jupiter is more typical than indicated by previous analyses  instead of @xmath1 mass exoplanets being twice as common as @xmath2 planets we find they are three times as common . in addition",
    "long term trends in velocity , not yet identified with planets , are common .",
    "both of these observations indicate that the detected exoplanets are the observable tail of the main concentration of massive planets of which jupiter is likely to be a typical member rather than an outlier .",
    "null results from microlensing searches have been used to constrain the frequency of jupiter - mass planets ( gaudi et al .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : massperiodmore ] . less than @xmath73 of the lensing objects ( presumed to be galactic bulge m - dwarfs ) have planetary companions within the dashed wedge - shaped area ( the period scale , but not the au scale , is applicable to this area ) .",
    "a conversion of the relative frequencies reported here to a fractional abundance in the wedge - shaped area yields the rough estimate that more than @xmath44 percent of doppler - surveyed sun - like stars will be found to have companions with masses and periods in the wedge - shaped area .",
    "thus our results are crudely consistent with current microlensing constraints . however , because of the difference in host mass , ( @xmath74 for doppler surveys and @xmath75 for microlensing ) it is not clear that such a direct comparison is meaningful .",
    "for example , if in the next few years doppler and microlensing constraints appear to conflict , it may simply be that typical planetary masses scale with the mass of the host star , that is , jupiter - mass planets at jupiter - like orbital radii may be more common around @xmath74 stars than around @xmath75 stars .",
