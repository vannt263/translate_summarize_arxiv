    "psr b1259@xmath063 is a young radio pulsar ( spin period 48 ms ) orbiting a b2e star ss 2883 in a highly eccentric 3.4 yr orbit , having spindown power of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the distance from the earth is estimated as @xmath5 kpc @xcite .",
    "psr  b1259@xmath063  was the first example of a radio pulsar forming a binary with a non - degenerate companion @xcite .",
    "the psr  b1259@xmath063  system is an important astrophysical laboratory for the study of the pulsar wind interacting with a stellar wind , and the nonthermal radiation arising from the shocked pulsar wind .",
    "apart from psr  b1259@xmath063 , the only other example known in our galaxy is the psr  j1740@xmath03052 binary system @xcite , which has , however , much lower spindown power .",
    "be stars are characterized by strong mass outflows through the formation of a slow and dense equatorial disk @xcite . because psr  b1259@xmath063  has a highly eccentric orbit and",
    "the equatorial disk is likely inclined with respect to the orbital plane , the pulsar is expected to interact with the disk of the be star near periastron , by crossing the disk twice before and after the periastron passage ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the signatures of disk crossings can be seen in the radio observations , such as pulsar eclipse , the light curve of transient unpulsed emission , and the change of dispersion measure @xcite .",
    "the disk crossings also play important roles in producing the x - ray and gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "enhanced high - energy emission around periastron which is thought to arise from the interactions between the pulsar wind and the stellar wind / disk , has been observed in x - ray @xcite , soft @xmath6-ray @xcite , and very high energy gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "the basic properties of the x - ray emission have been revealed by the series of _ asca _ observations @xcite , which are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the x - ray luminosity is modest around periastron with @xmath7 , corresponding to about one percent of the spindown power .",
    "the intensity within a day is constant , while it varies by a factor of @xmath8 during the periastron passage . at around apastron ,",
    "the luminosity decreased by one order of magnitude ; ( 2 ) the x - ray spectrum is characterized by a power law of photon index @xmath9 without any detectable line emission ; ( 3 ) no significant x - ray pulsed emission at the pulsar spin period has been found . the upper limit ( at a 90% level ) on the pulse component is @xmath10 of the total x - ray flux .",
    "observations during the periastron passage in 2004 with _ xmm - newton _ have revealed more detailed behavior of x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the x - ray brightening prior to periastron was roughly coincident with the brightening of unpulsed radio emission , which can be identified with the entrance to the be star equatorial disk .",
    "moreover , @xcite have found remarkable hardening down to @xmath11 at the entrance of the disk prior to periastron , followed by a recovery to @xmath12 during the disk crossing .    in the hard x - ray domain , a dedicated three - week _ cgro _ observation in 1994 has resulted in a significant detection in the 30200 kev range at a few mcrab level with the osse instrument , with the spectrum being characterized by a power law of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the osse spectrum was consistent with the time - averaged _ asca _ spectrum extrapolated to the osse band . with the _",
    "integral _ satellite , the hard x - ray emission in the 20200 kev band was detected with @xmath14 significance based on the observation performed in 2125 march 2004 @xcite .",
    "the properties of the x - ray and soft @xmath6-ray emission observed with _",
    "asca _ and _ cgro _ have been shown to be consistent with the idea that the emission is produced by shock - accelerated @xmath2  pairs as a result of the interactions between the pulsar wind and the be star outflows @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2  pairs are considered to be accelerated at the inner shock front of the pulsar wind and adiabatically expanding in the relativistic flow of the pulsar cavity . as a scale - down version of pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne )",
    ", the psr  b1259@xmath063  system can be referred to as a _ compactified pulsar wind nebula _ , and serves as a unique diagnostic of shock acceleration subject to very fast cooling .",
    "indeed , synchrotron radiation by the accelerated @xmath2  pairs offers an excellent explanation for the observed x - ray emission , indicating the existence of a remarkably efficient acceleration mechanism at an energy of tev on a timescale less than @xmath15 sec @xcite . the anisotropic inverse - compton scattering on the intense stellar light of the accelerated @xmath2  pairs was predicted to be detectable by air cherenkov telescopes @xcite .    during the periastron passage in 2004 ,",
    "very high energy gamma - rays have been indeed detected by the hess telescopes @xcite .",
    "the level of the tev gamma - ray flux and the spectral shape were in a reasonable agreement with the theoretical expectation based on the compactified pwn model .",
    "however , the light curve around periastron disagreed with the early expectation , requiring a revision of the model . @xcite have introduced the change of the maximum energy of pairs as a viable explanation for the behavior of the tev light curve . also , they argued that the increase of the adiabatic loss rate near periastron is another possible way to naturally account for the reduction of the tev flux .",
    "since the change of the maximum energy and/or the adiabatic loss rate can be imprinted in the synchrotron x - ray spectrum , the detailed x - ray observations are thus quite important to understand the behavior of the tev radiation as emphasized by @xcite .    in this paper , we present the results from our monitoring observations made with the _ suzaku _ satellite in the x - ray and hard x - ray bands , with an effective energy range of 0.650 kev , performed during the most recent periastron passage in 2007 .",
    "combined with the previous measurements in x - ray , the _ suzaku _ observations have clarified the spectral evolution of the psr  b1259@xmath063  system .",
    "thanks to the wide band coverage , we have discovered the existence of a spectral break in a certain epoch .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the observations and basic data reduction are described in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the results of x - ray analyses are presented in  [ sec : ana ] . in ",
    "[ sec : interpretation ] , we outline our model of a compactified pulsar wind nebula , and interpret the x - ray spectral break as a manifestation of the lorentz factor of the pulsar wind . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the distance to the psr  b1259@xmath063  system from the earth to be @xmath16 @xcite . for the calculation of the pulsar orbit , we assume a mass of ss  2883 to be @xmath17 and the pulsar mass to be @xmath18 , which implies an inclination angle of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the adopted orbital elements of the pulsar are an orbital period of 1236.72 day , eccentricity of @xmath20 , longitude of periastron of @xmath21 , and the epoch of periastron of mjd 48124.34 @xcite .",
    "all errors are quoted at a 90% confident level unless otherwise stated .",
    "we observed the psr b1259@xmath063 system eight times with the _ suzaku _ satellite each with @xmath22 ks exposure in 2007 july , august , and september .",
    "the total exposure time amounts to @xmath23 ks after standard data screening .",
    "we note that this is the first and possibly last chance for _ suzaku _ to observe the first disk transit since target visibility does not permit us to observe it next time .",
    "table  [ tbl : suzakulog ] gives the log of the _ suzaku _ observations ; the eight observing epochs are referred to as sz1sz8 hereafter . during the first four epochs ( sz1sz4 ) simultaneous observations with hess were coordinated .",
    "the results of the hess observations will be presented separately .",
    "the _ suzaku _ observations were performed with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in 0.312 kev and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in 13600 kev .",
    "the xis , located at the focal plane of the x - ray telescopes ( xrt : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consists of one back - illuminated ccd camera ( xis-1 ) and three front - illuminated ccds ( xis-0 , -2 and -3 ) .",
    "one of the front - illuminated ccds , xis-2 , was not available at the time of our observations , since it suffered from a fatal damage on 2006 november 9 , and unusable since then .",
    "the hxd consists of the silicon pin photo diodes ( hereafter pin ) capable of observations in the 1370 kev band and the gso crystal scintillators ( hereafter gso ) which cover the 40600 kev band .",
    "the xis instruments were operated in a normal full - frame clocking mode , with a frame time of 8 s. in this work , we present results from front - illuminated ccds ( xis-0 and -3 ) , which have a larger effective area at high energies , and therefore suited for our purpose .",
    "xis-0 and -3 have almost identical properties , so we co - added the data to improve photon statistics .",
    "psr  b1259@xmath063  was observed slightly off - axis ( @xmath24 from the optical axis ) , placed on the hxd nominal pointing position , to maximize the effective area of the hxd detectors .",
    "the hxd instruments were operated in the normal mode .",
    "the relative normalization of the hxd - pin spectrum to the xis was fixed at 1.15 , as was determined by the calibration observations of the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "the field - of - view ( fov ) of the xis contains another x - ray source , 2rxp j130159.6@xmath0635806 ( shortly 2rxp  j1301 ) , as shown in figure [ fig : image ] .",
    "this is an accretion - powered pulsar with a spin period of @xmath25  s @xcite , which is located @xmath26 away from psr b1259@xmath063 .",
    "we have monitored the 700-sec accretion - powered pulsar with the xis by tuning a telescope roll angle , to estimate its contribution to the hard x - ray flux measured by the non - imaging hxd - pin detector .",
    "we analyzed data delivered to us via pipeline processing version 2.0.6.13 ( sz1sz5 ) or version 2.1.6.15 ( sz6sz8 ) .",
    "basic analysis was done using the heasoft software package ( version 6.5 ) , with calibration files distributed on 9 july 2008 . for the xis and hxd - pin , we made use of cleaned event files , in which standard screening was applied .",
    "on the other hand , we reprocessed the hxd - gso data by ourselves to apply appropriate gain files .",
    "the standard screening procedures include event grade selections , and removal of time periods such as spacecraft passage of the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , intervals of small geomagnetic cutoff rigidity ( cor ) , and those of a low elevation angle .",
    "specifically , for the xis , the elevation angle larger than @xmath27 above the earth and larger than @xmath28 from the sunlit earth limb are selected .",

    "this is roughly consistent with the values obtained with _ xmm - newton _ during the previous disk passage in 2004 , @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that smaller column density ( @xmath77 ) has been observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ when the pulsar was positioned outside the disk @xcite .",
    "the excess column density can therefore be ascribed to the dense stellar disk . on the other hand ,",

    "such spectral hardening was discovered in 2004 with _ xmm - newton _ , but it appeared slightly earlier in phase ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "later in section  [ sec : broadband ] , we will demonstrate the presence of a spectral break during the hard - spectrum state , by utilizing hard x - ray measurements in the 1560 kev band with the _ suzaku _ hxd - pin .",
    "the x - ray lightcurves for individual observations were examined in order to study the temporal characteristic of the x - ray emission on short time scales .",
    "the 110 kev lightcurves with a bin size of 500 sec are shown in figure  [ fig : rate ] .",
    "we found moderate hour - scale flux variability ( @xmath81 ) at the time of disk crossings . on the other hand , the lightcurves in epochs sz5 and sz6",
    "can be fit well with a constant , suggesting that the flux variations would be characteristics of disk passage .",
    "the size of the emitting regions may be smaller in the equatorial disk .",
    "alternatively , there is a large density fluctuation inside the disk .    to search for possible spectral changes within each observation",
    ", we subdivided each epoch into several periods typically with an hour exposure , and fitted the short time - frame spectra with a power law modified by photoelectric absorption .",
    "though the power - law normalization differs between sub - epochs , no statistically significant spectral changes were found , which indicates the stability of a spectral shape on hour scales .",
    "the density fluctuation inside the be star disk would be imprinted in the chaotic behavior of the x - ray lightcurves on hour scale in one way or another . the hour - scale variability _",
    "suzaku _ uncovered would offer a way to infer the pulsar s location relative to the be disk plane .",
    "future intense coverages during the post - periastron disk transit of the pulsar with _ suzaku",
    "_ will be able to constrain the structure of the be star disk .      with the _ suzaku _ observations , we are now accessible to a _ day - by - day _ broadband x - ray spectrum spanning two orders of magnitude in energy from 0.6 to 50 kev with sufficient sensitivities , by combining the xis ( 0.610 kev ) and the hxd - pin ( 1550 kev ) instruments .",
    "to extract the hxd - pin spectra of psr  b1259@xmath063 , we have to subtract the following background spectra from the total cleaned spectra : ( 1 ) instrumental background so - called non x - ray background ( nxb ) , ( 2 ) cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , that is the sum of unresolved active galactic nuclei in the fov of the pin , and ( 3 ) the emission from the nearby pulsar 2rxp  j1301  that lies within the fov of the pin . the instrumental background spectra ( perhaps due mostly to atmospheric neutrons ) , provided by the hxd instrument team ,",
    "are constructed by the empirical models , which rely on a database of earth occultation observations .",
    "the hxd team provides two kinds of background models ,  quick \" and  tuned \" .",
    "we found the two models give almost identical results within the statistical uncertainties . in this paper",
    "we make use of the  tuned \" nxb model , which offers better background reproducibility achieving the @xmath82 systematic error of @xmath833% @xcite .",
    "the systematic error of the nxb subtraction does not have noticeable impact on the results presented in this paper .",
    "the cxb flux in the fov of the pin instrument was subtracted from each pin spectrum in the same way as @xcite .",
    "the cxb flux amounts to @xmath1% of the nxb , comparable to the systematic error of the nxb model itself .",
    "we now describe the procedures used for the derivation of hard x - ray spectra of 2rxp  j1301  in each pointing .",
    "in fact , the main contributions to the systematic error of the pin spectral data of the psr  b1259@xmath063  system itself would be the uncertainties in the hard x - ray flux contaminated by 2rxp  j1301 . to describe the x - ray spectrum of 2rxp  j1301 , we adopt the following empirical spectral form that has been traditionally applied to accretion - powered pulsars : @xmath84 where @xmath64 is the normalization @xcite .",

    "the assumption of a power - law spectrum for psr  b1259@xmath063  in the 0.650 kev band in epochs sz5 and sz6 can be justified , to some extent , by the osse results @xcite , which came from the three - week observation covering a certain orbital phase that encompasses the two _ suzaku _ epochs .",

    "<S> we observed psr b1259@xmath063 , a young non - accreting pulsar orbiting around a be star ss 2883 , eight times with the _ suzaku _ satellite from july to september 2007 , to characterize the x - ray emission arising from the interaction between a pulsar relativistic wind and be star outflows . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectra showed a featureless continuum in 0.610 kev , modeled by a power law with a wide range of photon index 1.31.8 . when combined with the _ suzaku _ pin detector which allowed spectral analysis in the hard 1550 kev band , x - ray spectra </S>",
    "<S> do show a break at @xmath1 kev in a certain epoch . regarding the psr  b1259@xmath063  system as a compactified pulsar wind nebula , in which @xmath2  pairs </S>",
    "<S> are assumed to be accelerated at the inner shock front of the pulsar wind , we attribute the x - ray spectral break to the low - energy cutoff of the synchrotron radiation associated with the lorentz factor of the relativistic pulsar wind @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our result indicates that comptonization of stellar photons by the unshocked pulsar wind will be accessible ( or tightly constrained ) by observations with the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope during the next periastron passage . </S>",
    "<S> the psr  b1259@xmath063  system allows us to probe the fundamental properties of the pulsar wind by a direct means , being complementary to the study of large - scale pulsar wind nebulae . </S>"
