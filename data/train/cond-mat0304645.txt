    "in the preceding paper@xcite we suggested a new method for ab - initio electronic - structure calculations of solids .",
    "the main steps of this procedure are :    1 .",
    "perform a conventional , self - consistent , band - structure calculation for an effective one - particle hamiltonian , namely , the hartree hamiltonian , to obtain a suitable basis set of bloch functions . 2 .   by taking into account only a finite number @xmath0 of bands",
    "one chooses a truncated one - particle hilbert space .",
    "the marzari - vanderbilt@xcite algorithm is then used to construct a maximally localized set of wannier functions , which span the same truncated one - particle hilbert space .",
    "3 .   all one - particle ( tight - binding ) and two - particle ( coulomb ) matrix elements of the hamiltonian within this wannier function basis are calculated .",
    "the resulting electronic many - body hamiltonian in second quantization with parameters determined from first principles is studied within standard many - body approximations for lattice electron systems .    in this paper",
    "we apply this scheme to the 3d transition metals fe , co , ni , and cu .",
    "we use the `` linear muffin - tin orbital '' ( lmto ) method within the `` atomic - sphere approximation '' ( asa)@xcite to perform the band - structure calculation for the hartree hamiltonian in first quantization .",
    "the direct coulomb matrix elements of the maximally localized wannier basis are rather large , about 20 ev in magnitude .",
    "we then use the simplest possible many body approximation , the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) , to study the second - quantized multiple - band hamiltonian .",
    "our results are compared with those obtained from a standard lsda calculation.@xcite although the 3d - bands and the 4s - band overlap in the l(s)da approximation , our unscreened hfa calculations give 3d - bands that lie considerably lower ( between 10 and 20 ev ) than the 4s - band .",
    "the hfa correctly predicts ferromagnetism for the ferromagnetic metals fe , co , and ni and no magnetism for cu , but with a much larger exchange splitting between majority and minority 3d bands than obtained within lsda and with a slightly larger magnetic moment per site than obtained experimentally or within lsda . on the other hand ,",
    "the total energy is lower in hfa than in lsda .",
    "the lsda results for metals are probably more reliable than our new hfa results , which lack important screening and correlation effects . in order for our method to go beyond lsda",
    "we would need to use better many body methods than the ( unscreened ) hfa , which should be possible within our scheme .",
    "our purpose in presenting the hfa results is to demonstrate that the new ab - initio many - body method that we have proposed is feasible and can be applied to practical calculations of materials .",
    "in addition , because hfa is the assumed standard starting point before adding complex many - body correlations , and because it is the simplest many - body approximation ( or the best mean - field one - particle approximation ) , it is useful to know what the hfa predicts for the 3d transition metals , which have been so heavily studied by other techniques .",
    "comparisons of hfa results with experiments , other ( higher order ) theories , or established standard methods such as the l(s)da should demonstrate the effects of correlation on electronic properties in d - electron systems .    to the best of our knowledge we do not know of any published hfa results ( band structure , density of states , magnetism , magnetic moment , total energy , etc . ) for the 3d ferromagnets fe , co and ni , unless it was implicitly applied to these materials for schemes like the local ansatz@xcite , where hfa results serve as an input to higher order calculations .",
    "the is not surprising since the hfa has , from very early on , been viewed as a poor approximation for metals . for example , when applied to the homogeneous electron gas ( as the simplest model of an infinite metallic system ) , the hfa has well - known fermi edge singularities@xcite .",
    "these lead , in particular , to a vanishing density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy , which is , of course , unphysical .",
    "this unphysical feature usually prevails in actual hfa - calculations for real metals@xcite , though sometimes this singularity is hard to see in actual hfa - results@xcite . in our calculations",
    "the non - locality is handled through the calculation of expectation values ( matrix elements of the density matrix ) , which makes hf calculations as easy as hartree calculations .",
    "furthermore , because of our localized wannier basis , we only keep on - site and a few inter - site coulomb and exchange matrix elements .",
    "hence our calculations have an effective short - ranged coulomb interaction . although longer - range coulomb matrix elements are small in our calculations , which is why we truncate them , it is possible that if all of them were kept to infinite distances that they could add up to give fermi edge singularities ( which are due to the long - ranged nature of the bare coulomb interaction ) and other standard anomalies .",
    "correlation or screening would quickly kill these effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : lmtohartree ] we describe the lmto - hartree calculations and the hartree - results for the band structure and density of states , respectively .",
    "section [ sec : wannierfunctions ] describes some results obtained for the maximally localized wannier functions obtained within the marzari - vanderbilt algorithm@xcite , in particular their localization properties .",
    "results for the matrix elements , in particular the direct coulomb and exchange matrix elements are given in section [ sec : matrixel ] ; we also compare these results with calculations of the slater integrals .",
    "the application of the ( unscreened ) hfa to the multiband many - body hamiltonian in second quantization is the subject of section [ sec : hartreefock ] . for an interpretation of the results we compare the numerical hfa results obtained for the crystal with previous atomic hfa results and with numerical and analytical results for a simplified local ( atomic or zero band width ) model in section [ sec : atomichfa ] .",
    "a comparison with the more standard lsda - results follows in section [ sec : lsda ] , before the paper closes with a short discussion .",
    "for the four materials of interest ( fe , co , ni , cu ) we performed a selfconsistent hartree band - structure calculation . besides the nuclear charge we used the ( experimentally ) known results for the lattice structure ( bcc for fe , fcc otherwise ; co should actually be hexagonal ) and for the lattice constant as input . for the band - structure calculation we used the lmto method@xcite within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) .",
    "the radius of the ( overlapping ) muffin - tin spheres ( the wigner - seitz radius @xmath1 ) is determined by the condition that the sphere volume equals the volume of the unit cell .",

    "the bloch functions obtained from this hartree calculation are used as the basis of a truncated hilbert space . in the band calculation",
    ", there is already a natural truncation due to the spherical harmonics expansion cutoff @xmath15 , which limits the calculation to 9 bands for one atom per unit cell .",
    "the connection between the bloch functions in the different muffin - tin spheres is given by the standard bloch relation @xmath16 hence the bloch function in a single muffin - tin sphere determines the function for the whole crystal .",

    "the wannier functions are rather admixtures having different @xmath24-contributions ( 3d , 4s , 4p etc . ) .",
    "but , since the original bloch functions from which the wannier functions are constructed were given in terms of a spherical harmonics expansion , the new wannier functions ( and their contribution in each individual muffin - tin sphere ) can also be decomposed into these spherical harmonics contributions @xmath25 one can then calculate the weight of the contributions to the wannier function ( centered at @xmath21 ) within the different muffin - tin spheres @xmath26 and one can also decompose this into the different @xmath27-contributions according to : @xmath28 for the 3d - system iron these quantities are tabulated in table [ tab : fe_wf ] .",

    "the splitting between the occupied and unoccupied 3d - states is about 23 ev , which is the on - site @xmath46 for co. magnetic hfa solutions are also found in the atomic limit for co , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : coatom ] .",
    "the majority - spin 3d states ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) are now completely filled and energetically lie lower than the corresponding non - magnetic hfa - states .",
    "but only the ( 3-fold degenerate ) @xmath48-states of the minority - spin electrons are filled whereas the @xmath49-states of the minority electrons are empty ( and now even 26 ev above the occupied d - states ) .",
    "the additional energetical shifts between the occupied 3d - states in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic atomic hfa solution are due to the exchange matrix elements @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior can qualitatively be understood within the framework of the following simple , analytically solvable model .",
    "similar to the numerical hfa - results presented and discused above , we neglect all intersite one - particle ( hopping ) and interaction matrix elements . furthermore , we assume that we have diagonalized the one - particle hamiltonian , taking into account only the atomic 3d - levels and assuming that the on - site one - particle diagonal matrix elements @xmath50 , the coulomb matrix elements @xmath46 , and the exchange matrix elements @xmath0 are equal , i.e. , that the 3d - levels are degenerate in the atomic limit with no crystal - field effects .",

    "this also explains why the hartree - fock bands are shifted downwards from the hartree bands by an energy of the amount @xmath46 .",
    "one also sees from this simple atomic - limit hartree - fock model that the energy difference between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied effective hartree - fock one - particle energies is again essentially @xmath46 , which is once more in agreement with our numerical results for the crystal and for the atom ( cf .",

    "this downwards shift of the hfa 3d - bands compared to the hartree- and l(s)da-3d - bands can be understood as due to the self - interaction correction of hfa .",

    "our ab - initio calculation of the direct coulomb matrix elements yields large values of the magnitude of 20 ev .",
    "therefore the coulomb energies are large for these materials and hfa can be considered to be an approximation for the selfenergy which is correct only in linear order in the coulomb interaction .",

    ". one should apply systematic extensions of hfa , which within the standard perturbational approach can be represented by ( a resummation of an infinite series of ) feynman diagrams , or one can try to apply the recently so successful non - perturbational many - body schemes like `` dynamical mean field theory '' ( dmft)@xcite or variational ( gutzwiller ) approaches@xcite .",
    "the simplest standard diagram series are the bubble diagrams leading essentially to the  random phase approximation ",
    "this means just a renormalization of the interaction line , i.e. the pure `` naked '' coulomb interaction has to be replaced by a `` dressed '' interaction . or in other words , the exchange ( fock ) contribution has not to be calculated with the bare coulomb matrix elements but with screened coulomb matrix elements .",
    "probably the non - perturbational schemes like dmft are also only applicable for screened coulomb matrix elements .    to summarize , the new many - body ab - initio approach proposed in ref .",
    "is applicable to real materials .",
    "maximally localized wannier functions and their one- and two - particle matrix elements can be calculated from first principles so as to obtain a many - body multi - band hamiltonian in second quantization .",
    "standard methods of many - body theory can then be applied to this hamiltonian .",
    "the simplest approximation ( hfa ) is unreliable , because the large coulomb matrix elements are unscreened .",
    "therefore , in the future better many - body approximations should be used . within the standard feynman diagram approach the most straightforward next step consists in a summation of bubble diagrams leading to a renormalized ( screened ) coulomb interaction .",
    "this requires calculating the exchange contribution not with the bare but with a screened coulomb interaction . to take into account the effects of screening one",
    "has to calculate the charge susceptibility and the ( static ) dielectric constant , which can be done within a generalized lindhard theory , for instance .",
