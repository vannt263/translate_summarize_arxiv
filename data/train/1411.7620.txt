    "due to the promising applications in the area of quantum information processing@xcite and device technology,@xcite spin dependent phenomena@xcite in low dimensional structures have been of major interest in scientific communities for several years .",
    "the main route of spin related phenomena is the well known spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) . in semiconductor structures",
    ", soi originates due to the inversion symmetry breaking either in the bulk or at the hetero - interface .",
    "band bending in heterostructure gives rise to an electric field to produce an asymmetric confining potential which itself is responsible for generating a soi of rashba type.@xcite the strength of rashba soi is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field generated and hence is tunable@xcite with the aid of an external gate voltage .",
    "another kind of soi , usually termed as dresselhaus soi,@xcite originates due to the breaking of inversion symmetry in the bulk crystal . in general the strength@xcite of the dresselhaus soi is smaller than that of rashba soi in heterostructure .",
    "the case of equal strength of both sois is of particular importance for future scope of developing non - ballistic spin field effect transistor.@xcite    in a quantum well , restriction of carrier s motion by an additional confinement in a particular direction essentially leads to the formation of a quantum wire ( qw ) .",
    "the width of qw is of the order of the fermi wave length in order to allow ballistic transport.@xcite semiconductor qw with soi is considered as a building block for a better implementation@xcite of spin - field effect transistor.@xcite an in - plane magnetic field along the wire direction lifts the @xmath13 degeneracy in a spin - orbit coupled qw and as a result a gap is induced in the energy spectrum .",
    "immense interests have been grown on the gapped spin - orbit coupled qw because of several proposals of asymmetric spin filtering,@xcite controlling impurities@xcite by a magnetic field , topological superconducting phase,@xcite helical states@xcite etc .",
    "recently , magnetic field induced spin - orbit gap in an one dimensional hole gas has been realized experimentally.@xcite    in the present study we mainly focus on various consequences of electron - phonon interaction in a spin - orbit coupled gapped qw by calculating phonon limited resistivity and phonon - drag thermopower in the bloch - gruneisen ( bg ) regime . in the bg regime , the resistivity differs abruptly from its equipartition behavior .",
    "an upper bound of the bg regime can be defined by the characteristic temperature @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the sound velocity and @xmath16 is the fermi wave vector .",
    "below @xmath17 the acoustic phonon energy is comparable with the thermal energy . due to the smallness of fermi surface in semiconductor structures , acoustic phonon with wave vector @xmath18",
    "can not be excited appreciably which in turn leads to a complicated temperature dependence of resistivity below @xmath17 .",
    "the existence of the bg regime in semiconductor quantum well has been confirmed experimentally.@xcite another important quantity that can be used to probe the electron - phonon interaction in semiconductor nanostructure is the phonon - drag contribution to the thermoelectric power .",
    "a number studies have been performed to understand the behavior of phonon limited mobility@xcite and phonon - drag thermopower@xcite in quantum well and wire for several years .",
    "recently , acoustic phonon limited resistivity@xcite and phonon - drag thermopower@xcite in a rashba spin - orbit coupled two dimensional electron gas have been studied .",
    "it is revealed through a numerical analysis that the effective exponents of the temperature dependence of both resistivity and thermopower depend significantly on the strength of the rashba soi .    in bg regime",
    ", we find analytically that both resistivity and phonon - drag thermopower in a spin - orbit coupled gapped qw maintains a power law dependence with temperature i.e. @xmath0 or @xmath3 .",
    "the effective exponent @xmath4 is @xmath5 and @xmath6 due to deformation potential ( dp ) and piezoelectric ( pe ) scattering , respectively in the case of phonon limited resistivity .",
    "for phonon - drag thermopower @xmath4 becomes @xmath7 and @xmath8 due to dp and pe scattering , respectively .",
    "the exponent @xmath4 has also been extracted numerically which clearly undergoes a transition from bg regime to equipartition limit . at a relatively higher density , @xmath4 is in excellent agreement with the analytical results .",
    "temperature variation of @xmath4 for different rashba parameter ( @xmath9 ) at a fixed density has also been shown .",
    "the effect of @xmath9 on the temperature dependence of @xmath4 becomes less prominent as one approaches towards higher density .",
    "additionally , the dependence of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 on carrier density has been shown in which both quantities undergo a transition from a relatively low to a higher density behavior .",
    "we organize this paper in the following way . in section",
    "ii we present all the theoretical details .",
    "numerical results and discussions have been reported in section iii .",
    "we summarize our work in section iv .",
    "we consider a semiconductor qw of radius @xmath19 in which electrons are free to move in the @xmath20- direction .",
    "rashba soi in a qw essentially breaks the spin - degeneracy@xcite by shifting the non - degenerate subbands laterally along the wave vector .",
    "but the spectrum is still degenerate at @xmath13 .",
    "an external magnetic field @xmath21 along the wire direction can be used to lift this degeneracy further by inducing a gap @xmath22 in the energy spectrum.@xcite now the single particle hamiltonian describing a gapped qw with rashba soi is written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electron momentum in the @xmath20- direction , @xmath25 is effective mass of electron , @xmath26 is the unit matrix , @xmath27 s are the pauli spin matrices , and @xmath9 is the strength of rsoi .",
    "also @xmath28 is the zeeman energy with @xmath29 and @xmath30 as the effective lande @xmath31- factor and bohr magneton , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath32 is the confining potential in the transverse direction @xmath33 .",
    "the wire is assumed to be thin enough so that only the lowest subband in the transverse direction is occupied by electrons . by diagonalizing eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) , the eigen energies corresponding to the present physical system can be found in the following form @xmath34 where @xmath35 describes the branch index .",
    "note that the energy is measured from the bottom of the lowest sub - band energy @xmath36 with @xmath37 as the sub - band wave vector .",
    "the eigen functions corresponding to the @xmath38 and @xmath39 branches are respectively given by @xmath40    and    @xmath41    where @xmath42 .",
    "the lowest subband wave function for @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 as the bessel function of order @xmath46 .",
    "it is important to mention that @xmath47 is the first zero of @xmath48 . out side the quantum wire @xmath49 vanishes .    at a fixed energy namely , fermi energy @xmath50",
    ", one can have the following expression for the fermi wave vectors @xmath51 where @xmath52 . in the @xmath53 limit , eq .",
    "( [ ferm_wave ] ) reduces to the known forms of the fermi wave vectors of a rashba spin - orbit coupled quantum wire .    the velocity corresponding to the energy spectrum given in eq .",
    "( [ eig_eng ] ) is calculated as @xmath54      in this section we shall calculate resistivity due to the electron - phonon interaction using boltzmann transport theory .",
    "we restrict ourselves to consider only the longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonon modes . using drude s formula , the resistivity is simply written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the inverse relaxation time ( irt ) averaged over energy and @xmath10 is the density of electron .",
    "the energy averaged irt for a specific energy branch @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59^{-1}$ ] is the fermi - dirac distribution function with @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath8- factor appears to consider the @xmath61 contribution since the energy spectrum is symmetric about @xmath13 .    according to the boltzmann transport theory ,",
    "the irt can be found in the following semi - classical form @xmath62    the transition probability from an initial state @xmath63 to a final state @xmath64 is given by the fermi s golden rule as    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the phonon wave vector with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69^{-1}$ ] is the phonon distribution function , @xmath70 is the matrix element corresponding to the electron - phonon interaction , @xmath71 is the form factor arising due to the transverse confinement .",
    "the first and second terms in the braces of eq .",
    "( [ trans_prob ] ) correspond to the absorption and emission of acoustic phonons , respectively .",
    "finally , the overlap integral @xmath72 coming from the spinor part of the wave function is given by @xmath73    the square of the electron - phonon matrix elements corresponding to dp and pe scatterings are respectively given by    @xmath74    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is deformation potential strength , @xmath77 is the relevant pe tensor component , @xmath78 is the mass density , and @xmath79 is the longitudinal ( transverse ) component of sound velocity .",
    "the anisotropic factors are given by @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "finally , the square of the form factor is defined as @xmath82    in literature , it is assumed@xcite that the electron density is sufficiently high near the axis of the wire and vanishes everywhere and consequently one replaces @xmath83 , where @xmath84 defines some confinement region . so in this approximation the square of the form factor can be readily obtained in the following exact form as @xmath85 . in the rest of the paper we will be using this expression of the form factor .",
    "let us now discuss the possibility of intra and inter - branch scatterings .",
    "generally , at low temperature intra - branch scatterings are dominant .",
    "to occur inter - branch scattering large momentum transfer is needed . since in the bg regime",
    "@xmath86 so the possibility of inter - branch scatterings are ruled out . in a spin - orbit",
    "coupled qw without the gap , the inter - branch scattering is strictly forbidden as readily understood from eq .",
    "( [ spinor_over ] ) since @xmath87 becomes unity as @xmath53 . but for @xmath88 inter - branch scattering are possible .",
    "we have checked numerically that the inter - branch contribution is very small in comparison with the intra - branch one .",
    "so henceforth we will consider only the intra - branch scattering .",
    "now , the summation over @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ invrt ] ) can be performed with the aid of @xmath90 given in eq .",
    "( [ trans_prob ] ) . in the bg regime ,",
    "phonon energy is comparable with the thermal energy but much less than the fermi energy i.e. @xmath91 .",
    "so one can safely make the following approximation @xmath92 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 signs correspond to the absorption and emission of acoustic phonons , respectively .",
    "using the above mentioned simplification and approximation one can find the energy averaged irt in the following form @xmath93    the summation over @xmath94 in eq .",

    "phonon gains a finite heat flux which in turn drags electron along with it from the hot to the cold end . in this way",
    "a phonon - drag contribution to the thermoelectric power is generated .",
    "phonon - drag thermopower is more fundamental quantity in probing electron - phonon strength experimentally .    to calculate phonon - drag thermopower two approaches named as @xmath109 and @xmath110-approach",

    "the boundary of the bg regime is defined by the characteristic temperature @xmath14 . for a typical value of electron density ,",
    "say @xmath204 we have @xmath205 k. but it is obtained numerically that the bg regime exists for a small range of temperature below @xmath200 k.    the temperature dependence of @xmath4 not only depends on the density but also on the rashba parameter @xmath9 .",
    "these facts are depicted in figs . 3 and 4 in which the temperature dependencies of @xmath4 corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath1 for different @xmath9 are shown .",
    "when density is low the temperature variation depends significantly on @xmath9 . at a relatively higher density ,",
    "the effect of @xmath9 on this temperature dependence is not so prominent for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
