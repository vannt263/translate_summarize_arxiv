    "the fluorescence of the nitrogen gas in the atmosphere in the visible ( vis ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) regions was independently proposed in the sixties of last century by greisen @xcite , delvaille et al .",
    "@xcite , suga @xcite , and chudakov @xcite as a way to detect high energy showers created by cosmic rays impinging on the earth atmosphere .",
    "nowadays the air fluorescence method is a well established technique used by the experiments hires @xcite , which is the continuation of the pioneering fly s eye experiment @xcite , auger @xcite , and by the telescope array project @xcite .",
    "the main emission of the fluorescence light is in the uv region between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the transparency of the atmosphere at those wavelength is limited by the presence of molecular oxygen and ozone , which absorb the uv photons . the rayleigh scattering , whose cross section scales as @xmath4 , and the mie scattering further reduce the number of photons which arrive at the detector .",
    "we introduce an extinction length @xmath5 , function of the wavelength @xmath6 , which enters in the transmission of the light through the relationship @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the intensity of a collimated light beam of wavelength @xmath6 after having travelled for the distance @xmath9 in the atmosphere , and @xmath10 is the initial intensity ( at @xmath11 ) . for the uv , @xmath12 .",
    "this fact poses two main drawbacks .",
    "first , the detector can not be placed at sea level , but at altitude .",
    "for example , auger is at about @xmath13 above sea level , hires at @xmath14 .",
    "second , the detection range of the instruments extends to a distance of the order of @xmath15 .",
    "auger , for example , is capable to detect the highest energy air showers at a distance of the order of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this is correlated to the total observation rate , which goes roughly as @xmath17 , which is therefore limited also by the atmospheric transmission .",
    "the atmosphere is very transparent in some regions of the near - infrared ( nir ) region , below @xmath18 .",
    "the molecules which present absorption bands are water and , in a minor extent , co@xmath19 .",
    "several high transparency windows are present : from 0.8 to @xmath20 , from 0.95 to @xmath21 , from 1.15 to @xmath22 , from 1.5 to @xmath23 , from 2.0 to @xmath24 ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) . moreover , the rayleigh scattering is negligible in the nir , because of the @xmath4 dependence . if the air fluoresces at those wavelengths , then there is the possibility to detect high energy cosmic rays impinging on the atmosphere at a very long distance from the detector , thus increasing the observation rate .",
    "the spectroscopy of the molecule of nitrogen is rather complex and has been extensively studied in the last century .",
    "an exhaustive review can be found in ref.@xcite . despite of this , to our knowledge there are no investigations on the infrared fluorescence emission from n@xmath19 or air excited by ionizing radiation .",
    "the only research which extends somewhere in the nir region was performed in the sixties by davidson and oneil @xcite , who used photomultipliers to reach the maximum wavelength of @xmath25 .    in this paper",
    "we present our first measurements of the fluorescence light in the nir region of air , nitrogen , and oxygen .",
    "the light emitted by the gas , excited by a @xmath0 electron beam , was detected by an ingaas photodiodes , sensitive down to about @xmath26 .",
    "spectra have been recorded at atmospheric pressure and room temperature by mean of a fourier transform infrared spectrometer .",
    "we also report on the light yield , which has been obtained by comparing the nir signal with the known fluorescence output in the uv region , measured by means of a silicon photodiode .",
    "a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig.[fg : setup ] .",
    "an electrostatic gun @xcite accelerated electrons , emitted by a hot filament , up to @xmath27 kinetic energy .",
    "electrons exited the gun through a cvd diamond window @xcite , @xmath28 thick , whose external side had been metalized to screen the fluorescence light emitted by the diamond itself .",
    "the gun was operated at @xmath0 in pulsed mode , with pulses @xmath29 long and rate of @xmath30 . in those conditions ,",
    "the electron current behind the diamond windows was a few hundreds @xmath31 .",
    "the chamber containing the gas was a stainless - steel cylinder with the axis along the beam path and volume about @xmath32 .",
    "the chamber size was a compromise between the range of the electrons in the gas and the need of an adequate solid angle for the detection of the light .",
    "the ionization cloud was almost entirely contained in the chamber , and the electrons that hit the materials of the chambers did not affected neither disturbed the measurements , as proved in section 3 .",
    "perpendicular to the axis , one opposed to the other , two quartz windows allowed to view inside the chamber .",
    "they were @xmath33 thick in order to stop the x - rays generated in the chamber , that could alter the signals of the photodiodes . by construction",
    ", they looked exactly at the same gas region , a small fraction ( about @xmath34 ) of the chamber volume .",
    "the light to the spectrometer exited through a third quartz window on the closing flange of the vessel . inside the chamber ,",
    "an electrode collected the ionization charge for the beam monitoring and normalization , which was fed into a charge amplifier .",
    "the output signal @xmath35 was displayed on a digital oscilloscope and also used as a feedback to stabilize the electron gun current against long term drifts .",
    "@xmath35 was compared to a reference voltage level , and the difference signal was used to opportunely bias the grid in front of the filament , which regulated the electron beam current intensity before acceleration .",
    "gas from certified bottles was flown in the chamber at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with a flux of @xmath36 .",
    "we used n@xmath19 ( impurity concentration @xmath37 ) , o@xmath19 ( impurity concentration @xmath38 ) , and dry air , which is a mixture of @xmath39 nitrogen and @xmath40 oxygen ( impurity concentration @xmath41 ) .",
    "the fluorescence light was detected by two solid state photodiodes ( pds ) , which could be placed on the two lateral windows of the chamber or inside the spectrometer .",
    "the uv light was detected by a squared si pd @xcite , @xmath42 area , with a quantum efficiency ( qe ) of about @xmath43 from @xmath2 to @xmath44 .",
    "the infrared radiations was detected by a round ingaas pd @xcite , @xmath45 diameter , sensitive from about @xmath46 to @xmath26 and cooled down to about @xmath47 by a built - in peltier cooler .",
    "its qe is above @xmath39 from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "the qe curves of both pds are shown in fig.[fg : pd_qe ] .",
    "each photodiode was readout by a dedicated charge preamplifier , based on the ua1 hybrid @xcite .",
    "the gain was measured by injecting a known calibration charge .",
    "the output signals were displayed and measured by means of a digital oscilloscope .",
    "since the si pd is also sensitive to the nir radiation , we used some colored glass filters to select only the uv photons .",
    "the combinations of two filters , the filter fgb25 ( by thorlabs ) and the filter ha30 ( by hoya corp . ) , produced the transmission curve shown in fig.[fg : pd_qe ] .",
    "only two bands are allowed , from @xmath2 to @xmath46 , which is the region of the uv fluorescence , and from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , where the fluorescence light output of air and nitrogen is negligible @xcite .",
    "spectra were recorded and analyzed by a fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) spectrometer ( mod .",
    "equinox55 by bruker optics ) which is essentially a two - arm michelson interferometer with a @xmath52 he - ne laser as reference light source .",
    "for the equinox55 the minimum measurable wavelength was @xmath52 .",
    "for details of this well known spectroscopic technique see for example ref.@xcite .",
    "the spectrometer was controlled and the data were elaborated by the software opus 5.5 ( by bruker optics ) .",
    "the laser light covered the same path of the radiation under measurement , and reached the detector , producing a very large noise . to filter the he - ne light",
    ", we placed a colored glass filter in front of the photodiode , which transmitted only photons with wavelength longer than @xmath53 ( filter fgl780 by thorlabs ) .",
    "the ftir spectrometer recorded the interferogram of the light source as a function of the wavenumber @xmath54 . in the calculation of the fourier transform of the interferogram to obtain the spectrum , we applied the apodization function blackman - harris ( 3-terms ) , and the phase correction with the mertz method ( no peak search ) @xcite .",
    "the spectrometer resolution on @xmath55 ranged between 20 and @xmath56 but the final spectrum resolution was worse because of the low spatial coherence of the light source and of the mathematical operations involved in the interferogram - to - spectrum conversion .",
    "note that a constant resolution @xmath57 on @xmath55 implies a non constant wavelength resolution @xmath58 , given by @xmath59 .    to reduce fluctuations and noise in the spectrum ,",
    "the final result was obtained by averaging together many different spectra ( between 10 and 20 ) .",
    "as preliminary operation , we verified that no light emission occurred from the cvd diamond window or from the quartz windows or other materials of the chamber . to accomplish that , we evacuated the chamber with a rotative pump and run the electron gun at the highest beam current and energy .",
    "we could not observe any light signal .",
    "figures [ fg : spettron2 ] , [ fg : spettroo2 ] , and [ fg : spettrodryair ] show the measured spectra of nitrogen , oxygen and dry air , respectively . the spectra were recorded at atmospheric pressure and room temperature ( @xmath60 ) , and measured with a resolution @xmath61 , apart from oxygen .",
    "they are corrected for the transmission curve of the filter fgl780 and for the qe curve of the ingaas pd , and truncated to @xmath62 . to identify the atomic transitions",
    ", we used the nist atomic spectra database @xcite .",
    "molecular nitrogen has a very rich spectrum , with numerous band systems corresponding to electronic transitions of n@xmath19 and n@xmath63 .",
    "the near infrared region is dominated by the first positive system ( @xmath64 ) ( fps ) .",
    "a less important system is the @xmath65 meinel system ( ms ) of the ionized nitrogen .",
    "the herman infrared system ( his ) also appears , which extends from @xmath50 to @xmath66 @xcite .    the spectrum in fig.[fg : spettron2 ] is dominated by the unresolved band around @xmath67 , which has been already observed by @xcite .",
    "the band is the overlap of two nearby atomic transitions at @xmath68 , characteristic of the forbidden doublet transition @xmath69_{32}$ ] , and of the fps ( 0 - 0 ) band ( fig.[fg : spettron2zoom ] ) .",
    "the second more intense band is the ( 0 - 1 ) band of the fps centered at @xmath70 .",
    "other minor bumps has been identified as belonging to the hir , to the ms ( at about @xmath71 ) and to the fps ( the ( 0 - 2 ) band centered at @xmath72 ) .",
    "two very weak atomic lines of the neutral nitrogen atom are distinguishable at the side of the main band , at @xmath73 ( transition @xmath74 ) and at @xmath75 ( transition @xmath76 ) .",
    "because of the weak intensity and the poor resolution , bands from about 1250 to @xmath77 can not be unambiguously identified .",
    "since the oxygen fluorescence light output is sensibly lower than the nitrogen or dry air one , we run the spectrometer with a resolution @xmath78 .",
    "molecular oxygen is a weak light emitter since transitions from excited states to the ground state are strongly forbidden , for most of the excited states . as a fact",
    ", the only line we could clearly identify to belong to a molecular transition is the faint line at @xmath79 , which is the well - known @xmath80 magnetic dipole intercombination transition @xcite .",
    "all other lines have been identified as atomic transitions from the excited neutral oxygen ( o i ) , created by electron - impact dissociation of the o@xmath19 molecule , or from the single ionized atom ( o ii ) .",
    "the list of the lines and relative transitions is reported in table [ tab : o2lines ] .",
    "the line at @xmath81 is the sum of two very close lines , which were not resolved by the spectrometer .",
    "the line intensities , after the continuum subtraction , are normalized to the highest intensity line .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we calculated the weighted average , which yields @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , our estimate of the nir light yield @xmath83 is    @xmath84",
    "the light yield of dry air in the nir is about @xmath85 of the uv yield .",
    "the qe of the ingaas semiconductor is about @xmath86 times higher than the uv photocathode of a photomultiplier , so the total number of photoelectrons is approximately the same in the two cases .",
    "however , from a practical point of view , when compared to photomultipliers , operation with ingaas photodiodes poses several drawbacks , such as :    - small dimension ( area @xmath87 ) ;    - no multiplication ;    - need of a low noise electronics .",
    "therefore , detection of cosmic showers with ingaas pds is nowadays not compelling",
    ".    the situation could be different if we adopt si semiconductor , whose qe can extend down to the neighborhood of @xmath88 , being limited by the @xmath89 band - gap of the ordinary bulk silicon .",
    "moreover , photodiodes can be produced with an internal gain , obtaining avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) , with gain in the range @xmath90 and surface area larger than @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "however , limiting the wavelength range would decrease the light output .",
    "the amount of nir light with @xmath92 is about @xmath93 of the total light yield in the @xmath94 range .",
    "therefore , si apd in the nir is about a factor of 10 less sensitive with respect to the uv light , at parity of detecting surface area .",
    "so far we have not mentioned the main argument in favor of the nir fluorescence , namely , the transparency of the atmosphere . the uv light produced by a shower @xmath95 far away from the detector is attenuated by the atmosphere by about a factor of 10 .",
    "then , since atmosphere is transparent in the nir , detection of the nir fluorescence with a si apd is , in this case , equivalent to the detection of the uv light with photomultipliers .    for the general case",
    ", it is likely that the detection of uhecrs through the nir fluorescence with si apds is not much disadvantaged with respect to the uv fluorescence with photomultipliers .",
    "the principal pro for the physics of uhecrs would be the increase of the event rate , which scales as @xmath17 .    on the opposite side , however , it must be demonstrated that the large background noise of the atmosphere in the nir , which is higher than in the uv @xcite , can be handled and does not introduce other limitations .",
    "the technological research on si apds towards the enhancement of the response in the nir is progressing and has already reached remarkable results , not yet transferred on commercial devices .",
    "for example , several groups have obtained apds with qe above @xmath96 for @xmath97 by laser treatment of the si surface @xcite .",
    "others used inclusions of sige absorbing layers to enhance the qe well beyond the si cutoff wavelength @xcite .",
    "it is therefore thinkable that in the near future the si apds are much more performing than the actual ones .",
    "for sake of completeness , we have also to mention the possibility to use nir photomultipliers , whose sensitivity now extends down to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "they have a small active area ( smaller than the ingaas pd ) and a qe @xmath98 .",
    "therefore operation with such photomultipliers seems not competitive with respect to large area si apds .",
    "we have measured for the first time the fluorescence light of the air in the near infrared region .",
    "the nir photon yield is 1/5 of the uv yield .",
    "we propose such fluorescence light as a new way to detect uhecrs .",
    "since the atmosphere is more transparent in the nir than in the uv region , there is reasonable expectation that the new method could lead to an increase of the uhecr observable rate .",
    "this paper is the first step of a research program which aims to this goal .",
