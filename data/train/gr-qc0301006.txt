    "in this paper we introduce a numerical code designed to solve the einstein field equations for axisymmetric spacetimes . even though the predominant focus in numerical relativity in recent years has been to study situations of relevance to gravitational wave detection , and hence lacking symmetries , there are still numerous interesting problems , both physical and computational , that can be tackled with an axisymmetric code .",
    "the advantages of restricting the full 3d problem to axisymmetry ( 2d ) are that the complexity and number of equations are reduced , as are the computational requirements compared to solving a similar problem in 3d .",
    "prior numerical studies of axisymmetric spacetimes include head - on black hole collisions  @xcite , collapse of rotating fluid stars  @xcite , the evolution of collisionless particles applied to study the stability of star clusters  @xcite and the validity of cosmic censorship  @xcite , evolution of gravitational waves  @xcite , black hole - matter - gravitational wave interactions @xcite , and the formation of black holes through gravitational wave collapse  @xcite and corresponding critical behavior at the threshold of formation  @xcite .",
    "our goals for creating a new axisymmetric code are not only to explore a wider range of phenomena than those studied before , but also to provide a framework to add adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) and black hole excision to allow more thorough and detailed investigations than prior works .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : formalism ]",
    "we describe the @xmath0 decomposition  @xcite of spacetime that we adopt to arrive at our system of equations",
    ". the @xmath0 formalism is the familiar adm space + time decomposition ( in this case @xmath1 ) applied to a dimensionally reduced spacetime obtained by dividing out the axial killing vector , following a method devised by geroch  @xcite . in section  [ sec : coords_and_vars ] we specialize the equations to our chosen coordinate system , namely cylindrical coordinates with a conformally flat @xmath2metric . at this stage",
    "we do not model spacetimes with angular momentum , and we include a massless scalar field for the matter source . in section  [ sec : apph ]",
    "we discuss how we search for apparent horizons during evolution . in section  [ sec : implementation ] we describe our numerical implementation of the set of equations derived in section  [ sec : coords_and_vars ] .",
    "a variety of tests of our code are presented in section  [ sec : test ] , which is followed by conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . some details concerning our finite difference approximations ,",
    "solution of elliptic equations via the multi - grid technique , and a spherically symmetric code used for testing purposes are given in appendices a and b. unless otherwise specfied , we use the units and conventions adopted by misner , thorne and wheeler  @xcite .",
    "the most common approach in numerical relativity is to perform the so - called @xmath3 , or adm , split of the spacetime that one would like to evolve . in this procedure , a timelike vector field",
    "is chosen together with spatial hypersurfaces that foliate the spacetime .",
    "if axisymmetry is assumed , it is usually incorporated once the adm decomposition has been done , and is reflected in the independence of the various metric and matter quantities on the ignorable , angular coordinate , @xmath4 .",

    "the finite - difference equations on the boundary yield algebraic equations which determine the given fields there `` exactly . ''",
    "the subtlety arises because these algebraic conditions couple neighboring boundary points and thus despite the fact that we solve these equations exactly , the residual ( as computed after the entire boundary is `` relaxed '' ) will not be identically zero .",
