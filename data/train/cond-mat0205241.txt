    "forecasting in empirical finance is based on _ recipes _ that are often heuristic in nature and specific to the market being considered .",
    "numerous predictive techniques exist,@xcite some of which may be theoretically justified to a certain extent , but many others have been proposed in a purely _ ad hoc _ manner . technical analysis and",
    "the related  charting \" methods are therefore often dismissed by academics .",
    "nevertheless , in keeping with a more general trend,@xcite it is of interest to see whether statistical physics can bring some insight into the validity or applicability of these recipes .",
    "the ultimate and more general goal of such an analysis is to connect optimal strategies to fundamental questions about chaos and deterministic sequences in natural signals .",
    "the moving average ( ma ) of a stock price is a common tool in technical analysis , frequently used as an indicator for customers to buy or sell stocks.@xcite often , several mas are studied and their interrelations used as a trading signal .",
    "this method may also be applied to indices , sometimes in order to forecast market activities .",
    "a ma , @xmath0 at time @xmath1 of a time - dependent quantity @xmath2 is defined as :    @xmath3    i.e. the average of @xmath4 over the last @xmath5 data points prior to time @xmath1 .",
    "many other forms of mas exist , such as those involving an exponential smoothing , which tends to dampen out sudden changes .",
    "as was shown elsewhere @xcite the density of crossing points ( @xmath6 ) between two mas is a measure of the signal roughness :    @xmath7^{h-1},\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the hurst exponent and @xmath9 .",
    "let us now consider two mas , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , calculated over two different intervals , respectively @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath14.@xcite in empirical finance the two time intervals often correspond to quite distinct durations , two common choices being a week and a month , and 10 days and 30 days . in those cases it is possible to talk about a long - term and a short - term ma of a given time series .",
    "for conciseness we will use the same terminology here ( i.e. @xmath13 is the long - term ma , @xmath12 is the short - term ma ) , although in the present analysis occasionally the two time - periods may be quite close . clearly , if the original signal @xmath15 increases for a while before decreasing , then @xmath10 will cross @xmath11 from above .",
    "this event , in which the short - term ma crosses the long - term ma from above , is called a `` death cross '' in empirical finance,@xcite often interpreted as a `` sell '' signal.@xcite we will denote it by the symbol @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , if the short - term ma , @xmath10 , crosses the long - term ma , @xmath11 , from below , the crossing point coincides with an upsurge of the signal @xmath15 and may be taken as a  buy \" signal .",
    "this event is called a `` gold cross '' and we will denote it by @xmath17 .",
    "technical financial analysts usually try to `` extrapolate '' the evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and hence the underlying signal @xmath15 , based on their expectations for the occurrence of @xmath17 or @xmath16 crosses .",
    "most computers at brokerages or trading houses are equipped to automatically perform this kind of analysis and trigger the associated activity signals .",
    "as proposed by vandewalle and ausloos,@xcite one can visualize the change in the _ trend _ of a signal over some interval @xmath5 by considering a set of mas , thus displaying a ma spectrum , taking into account the successive crosses and/or their density .",
    "such a spectrum of mas is a powerful visualization tool that provides a compact representation of the trends of complex signals .    as noted before",
    ", the rate with which mas vary is of interest to investors who may base their trading strategies on it .",
    "it is clear that some uncertainty arises if @xmath17 and @xmath16 crosses are close to each other , or if the angles between crossing mas are small .",
    "thus , one can argue compellingly that in order to develop a reliable trading strategy , the angle between the ma signals as well as that between the ma signal and the horizontal should also be studied .",
    "all of these results will provide information on the slopes of the ma and therefore on the rates of the trend .",
    "the occurrences of @xmath17 and @xmath16 crosses are preceded by turnovers in the trend of the mas .",
    "thus an investigation of the distribution of time intervals between successive minima and maxima is of interest to provide a quantitative measure of the dynamics of the market . in order to gather more information for building an investment strategy based on such a generalized technical analysis , as well as to gain a better understanding of analysis tools for complex time series",
    ", we have also studied the distribution of time intervals between successive [ @xmath17,@xmath17 ] , [ @xmath16,@xmath16 ] , [ @xmath17,@xmath16 ] , and [ @xmath16,@xmath17 ] .",
    "finally , we have also analyzed the time interval between successive extrema in the ma as yet another measure of underlying trends .",
    "our methodology will be generally applicable , but to be specific we will use it here to analyze daily closing prices of the standard and poor s 500 index ( s&p500 ) over a 22-year period .",
    "we note that gopikrishnan et al.@xcite have studied a related s&p500 time series from a scaling perspective .",
    "however , these authors analyzed the signal over different time intervals and with finer time resolution .",
    "in addition , they did not address the ma technique .",
    "we consider the s&p500 daily closing price signal from jan . 01 , 1980 to dec . 31 , 2001 , as plotted in fig . 1a , with the associated probability density function ( pdf ) shown in fig",
    "the time series consists of 5556 data points , obtained from yahoo.@xcite . in order to visualize the mas calculated over different time periods and related crosses between them , fig .",
    "2 shows two mas of the s&p500 signal : @xmath20 for @xmath211  week and @xmath22 for @xmath231  month .",
    "as is to be expected , the monthly moving average is much smoother than the weekly one .    following the methodology of vandewalle and ausloos,@xcite we analyze the density of crossing points between two mas of the s&p500 closing price signal .",
    "this data is plotted in fig .",
    "3 as a function of @xmath9 , where @xmath12 varies between 1 and @xmath13 and @xmath13 = 120  days .",
    "the hurst exponent estimated from this data , using the relationship given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , is @xmath24 , in numerical agreement with that obtained by the detrended fluctuation analysis method and clearly distinct from the random walk ( rw ) value h = 0.50 .",
    "this confirms prior findings@xcite that both methods tend to give the same results for @xmath8 on the order of 0.45 .    in order to test the robustness of this result , following the proposal of viswanathan et al.@xcite , we shuffled the s&p500 signal in two ways yielding two new ( surrogate ) time series : one in which the amplitudes were randomly shuffled , the other where the sign of the s&p500 signal was randomly shuffled .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "1b , the pdf of the fluctuations of the s&p500 closing price signal is characterized by fat tails , which is a well - known result.@xcite it is generally accepted@xcite that the origin of the fat tailed distributions is a key question to understand financial time series .",
    "most authors believe that the fat tails are caused by long - range volatility correlations . by shuffling the order of the fluctuations the correlations between them",
    "are destroyed . the hurst exponent estimated from the scaling properties of the density of crossing points for the shuffled signal",
    "is found to be @xmath25 quite close to the rw value indicating a near - absence of long tails .",
    "in contrast , destroying only sign correlations , by shuffling the order of the signs ( but not the absolute values ) of the fluctuations , allows the fat tails to persist : the corresponding roughness exponent is @xmath26 . in both cases",
    "the surrogate data lead to densities of crossing points that scale like a brownian walk signal ( see fig .",
    "to visualize the change in the _ trend _ of the signal over some interval @xmath5 we consider a set of mas@xcite , with the long - term period fixed at @xmath27250  days , i.e. one market year .",
    "the short - term period @xmath12 is varied between 1 and @xmath28 and the relative difference @xmath29 between the two moving averages is computed .",
    "4a represents the resulting spectrum for the s&p500 closing price signal for the period from jan . 01 , 1990 to dec .",
    "31 , 2000 .",
    "the darker the grey levels the larger the distance ( i.e. the absolute value of the difference ) between the two mas.@xcite note the three light grey regions between 1995 and 2000 corresponding to a close proximity ( @xmath30 ) between the mas . this triplet pattern is repeated in rescaled form and for larger separation between the mas ( darker grey levels ) in 1997/98 within the middle light grey region and on an even smaller scale further repeated during 1999 within the right - hand - side light grey region .",
    "these rescaled patterns correspond to larger differences , @xmath31 , between the yearly ma and the mas with @xmath32  days . in the second half of 1997",
    "one can see the black region corresponding to a large difference , @xmath33 between mas for @xmath34  days and @xmath27250  days indicating the crash of oct .",
    "note that from the point of view of the difference between the mas , what happened during 1999 looks like a rescaled version of what took place in 1997/98 .    for the signals with shuffled order of the fluctuations these characteristic patterns disappeared and",
    "are replaced by a rather uniform structure ( see fig .",
    "the apparent streaking in this figure is an artefact due to the cut - off point for the various grey levels , corresponding to @xmath35 , and does not reflect any underlying periodicity .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the structures seen in fig .",
    "4a are the result of the long tails in the pdf , which are in turn associated with volatility correlations .",
    "clearly , then , the ma spectrum contains a great deal of relevant information about the dynamics of the signal . in the next few sections we will see how",
    "further dynamic parameters can be extracted from this ma information .",
    "in order to estimate the relative position between the two mas one can measure the angle between them at @xmath17 and @xmath16 crosses . the angle between the short- and long - term mas is a unique measure of the rate of change in the signal and should therefore be able to serve as a useful quantitative indicator of the system dynamics .",
    "the angle between two mas at a @xmath17 or @xmath16 cross can appear in three different settings depending on the angles between the mas and the horizontal ( i.e. the slope of the ma at the intersection ) . in fig . 5a and 5b these three scenarios",
    "are schematically drawn when the intersection is a @xmath17 , respectively , @xmath16 cross .",
    "note , for example , that at a @xmath17 cross the angle at which the short- or long - term ma intersects the horizontal , @xmath38 , respectively , @xmath39 , can be positive or negative . however , in all cases the long - term ma crosses the short - term one from above .",
    "this mutual relationship is expressed in the distribution of the angle @xmath40 between them .",
    "results for the s&p500 closing price signal for the period from jan . 1 , 1980 to dec . 31 , 2001 are shown in fig .",
    "6(a - f ) for @xmath17 and @xmath16 crosses .    the distribution of @xmath38 angles at @xmath17 crosses for the s&p500 closing price signal for the period from jan . 1 , 1980 to dec . 31 , 2001",
    "is plotted in fig . 6a as a set of histograms with bin - size 3@xmath41 . for brevity ,",
    "in the following , whenever we refer to an angle we will take this as the center of the corresponding bin .",
    "note that there is only one case of a negative angle , the relation schematically drawn in the left - hand - side inset of fig .",
    "the most frequently observed angle under which the short - term ma intersects the horizontal is 67@xmath41 .",
    "the angles are relatively uniformly distributed between 16@xmath41 and 85@xmath41 with additional spikes at 43@xmath41 , 79@xmath41 and 85@xmath41 .",
    "the distribution of the angle @xmath39 under which the long - term ma intersects the horizontal at a @xmath17 cross is rather different from that for the angle @xmath38 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "this histogram is approximately symmetrical with respect to positive and negative values with maxima at -14@xmath41 and at 7@xmath41 .",
    "the distribution of the angle @xmath40 between the two mas at a @xmath17 cross ( see fig .",
    "6c ) is rather uniform in the interval [ 20@xmath41,50@xmath41 ] with a maximum at 26@xmath41 and a number of low frequency occurrences at 29 , 38 and 46@xmath41 .    the distribution of angles under which the two mas intersect the horizontal and with one another at @xmath16 cross is plotted in fig .",
    "6(d - f ) .",
    "the angle @xmath38 of the short - term ma is mostly negative with one case of positive 60@xmath41 which corresponds to the case sketched in the right - hand - side inset of fig .",
    "at the time of crossings the @xmath38 angles of the short - term ma are paired with @xmath39 angles whose distribution is plotted in fig . 6e .",
    "therefore , the negative @xmath38 angles and positive @xmath39 angles correspond to the schematic representation in fig . 5b , while negative @xmath38 and negative @xmath39 values represent the case sketched in the left - hand - side inset in fig .",
    "the maximum value of the @xmath38 angle is at -82@xmath41 .",
    "one is very unlikely to observe an angle of -47@xmath41 in the data .",
    "the maximum @xmath39 value is equal to 7@xmath41 , so the long - term ma is most likely to be rather close to the horizontal with a quasi - homogeneous spread over the interval [ -10@xmath41 , 10@xmath41 ] . in comparison",
    "the spread of @xmath39 values at @xmath17 crosses reported above is a bit wider .",
    "the most likely angle @xmath40 between the mas at @xmath16 cross can have two values 23@xmath41 and 59@xmath41 with 33% less chance to have a value of 47@xmath41 .",
    "clearly , the distribution of the slopes of the mas at crosses as well as the angles between them is very rich and far from random .",
    "it remains to be seen if similar patterns can be detected in other financial time series and if their occurrence can be related to features of the spectrum .",
    "however , it seems evident that more sophisticated prediction strategies should take these variables into account .",
    "next , we have studied the distribution of the time intervals between successive [ @xmath17,@xmath17 ] , [ @xmath16,@xmath16 ] , [ @xmath17,@xmath16 ] , and [ @xmath16,@xmath17 ] crosses for the s&p500 closing price signal in two distinct time intervals chosen because they differ strongly in their investment environment .",
    "these are the time periods from jan 1 , 1980 to dec 31 , 1990 ( see fig .",
    "7(a - d ) ) and from jan 1 , 1991 to dec 31 , 2001 ( see fig .",
    "7(e - h ) ) , the former generally characterized by a rather  sluggish \" economy , the latter mainly reflecting the  bull market \" of the 1990s .",
    "while the shortest interval between successive [ @xmath17,@xmath17 ] crosses in the first case appears to be 3 days , during the second period it is twice as long , i.e. 6 days .",
    "the maximum of the distribution is observed to occur at 9 and 13 for the first period and at 17 days for the second period , and is thus not drastically different between the two periods .",
    "the most probable time interval between successive [ @xmath16,@xmath16 ] crosses during the first period is 19 days .",
    "time intervals of similar length : 20 - 22 days , e.g. approximately one market month , are very unlikely to occur during the second period , whose maxima are at 16 and 28 days .",
    "thus , downturns tended to occur more frequently in the 1980s than in the 1990s .",
    "a measure of the time necessary for the market to recover is the interval between [ @xmath17,@xmath16 ] crosses .",
    "its maximum is at 4 days during the first period . in sharp contrast , the second period is characterized by a high frequency of occurrence of [ @xmath17,@xmath16 ] crosses for time intervals between 2 to 6 days , indicating that the market tended to recover faster during the second observation interval .",
    "the way the market is going down from a @xmath16 to @xmath17 cross is reflected in the distribution of time intervals between consecutive @xmath16 and @xmath17 crosses . during both periods ,",
    "the most likely interval between successive @xmath16 and @xmath17 crosses is 4 days .",
    "as can be noticed in fig .",
    "2 , the occurrences of @xmath17 and @xmath16 crosses are preceded by turnovers of the trend of the mas . thus the distribution of time intervals between successive minima and maxima",
    "can be calculated in order to provide information on the dynamics of the market . to this end for the s&p500 signal studied here the pdfs of the time interval between successive maxima [ @xmath43 , minima [ @xmath44 , maxima - minima [ @xmath45 , and minima - maxima [ @xmath46 , are plotted in fig .",
    "8(a - h ) for the short - term , @xmath20 , and long - term , @xmath22 , mas .",
    "the x - axis of all data in fig .",
    "7(a - h ) is chosen in such a way that the bin of each x - axis is equal to one day .",
    "also the ticks are associated with the middle of the bin , i.e. to 0.5 . for the purpose of comparison the insets of fig .",
    "8(c - h ) have their x- and y - axis limits the same as those of fig .",
    "8(a , b ) .",
    "it is of interest to note that the pdfs of [ @xmath43 and [ @xmath44 for the short - term ma , @xmath20 , are very similar , which is not surprising , both with a maximum at 2 days .",
    "in contrast , the [ @xmath44 pdf for the long - term ma , @xmath22 , exhibits a maximum at 2 days and a rather homogeneous distribution for time intervals between 3 and 11 days , while the respective maxima - minima [ @xmath45 pdf has the appearance of an exponential one , although the scarcity of data does not allow us to make this statement rigorous .",
    "we also checked the frequency of appearance of combinations of positive and negative increments of the mas .",
    "let a positive increment be marked by 1 and a negative increment be marked by -1 .",
    "then we test the frequency of occurrence of time intervals between two consecutive triplets ( 1 1 -1 ) and between two consecutive triplets ( -1 - 1 1 ) for the two mas of interest .",
    "these data are shown in fig .",
    "9 for the weekly and monthly ma and the entire 22-year period .",
    "the increment of the histogram is 1  day .",
    "the weekly ma @xmath20 has a maximum of [ ( 1 1 -1),(1 1 -1 ) ] time interval at 9 days .",
    "the maximum of the [ ( -1 - 1 1),(-1 - 1 1 ) ] interval for @xmath20 is at 8 days with very low probability of occurrence at 4 days time interval .",
    "the maxima for [ ( 1 1 -1),(1 1 -1 ) ] is at 5  days and for [ ( -1 - 1 1),(-1 - 1 1 ) ] at 3  days for the monthly ma @xmath22 , while it is very unlikely that ( 1 1 -1 ) will be followed by ( 1 1 -1 ) after 21  days .",
    "there are also many time intervals that have zero probability to occur for [ ( -1 - 1 1),(-1 - 1 1 ) ] .",
    "they are 20 , 21 , 30 , 36 , 39 , 48 , 50 , 51 , 53 , 56 , 61 days , to mention some of them .",
    "we presented a set of quantitative measures of two mas of the s&p500 daily closing price signal and of their relative position to one another . since different mas",
    "represent the trend of the signal looked upon from different investment horizons , the measures of their relative geometry provide information on the change of the trend of the signal .",
    "the distribution of the time interval between @xmath47 and @xmath48 crosses , together with that of the maxima and minima in the ma , and the distribution of the angle between the two mas at the crosses can serve as ingredients for an investment strategy that enriches the classical technical analysis with parameters of the dynamics of the signal trend , i.e. of the momentum of s&p500 closing price .",
    "we emphasize , that these conclusions should not be taken as an endorsement of chartist strategies or technical analysis in general .",
    "whether it is possible to base a successful trading strategy on the rather subtle patterns observed here remains to be seen and has not been addressed in this paper .",
    "strictly speaking , in accord with the notation established in eqn .",
    "( 1 ) , these should be labelled @xmath49 and @xmath50 , but we will prefer the lighter notation established in the main text whenever no confusion can arise .    the vivid terms  death \" cross and  gold \" cross were introduced in the physics literature by vandewalle and ausloos.@xcite they are commonly used in the french financial literature (  croix de mort \" and  croix dore \" ) , although they are not as widespread in anglophone financial sources ."
