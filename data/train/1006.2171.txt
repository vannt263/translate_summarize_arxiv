    "charge - parity ( cp ) violation is one of the key ingredients for the dominance of matter over anti - matter in the present day universe .",
    "the presence of a complex phase in the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskwaw ( ckm ) matrix @xcite leads to cp violation in the standard model(sm ) . since the first observation of the cp violation in the kaon system @xcite ,",
    "several measurements have been performed to observe the same in @xmath2 and @xmath8 mesons and the experimental findings have , so far , been largely consistent with the prediction of the sm .",
    "however , the sm neither admits sufficient cp violation nor is the phase transition strong enough to explain the observed magnitude of the baryon asymmetry of the universe . this has led to a sustained effort over decades to look for an evidence of cp - violation going beyond what the sm predicts .",
    "indeed , during the past few years some experimental data collected at tevatron and b - factories in the heavy flavour - sector indicates mild conflict with the ckm picture of cp violation within the sm @xcite .",
    "several new scenarios have been proposed to explain these anomalies@xcite .",
    "much interest has been garnered by the recent observation@xcite , by the d0 collaboration , of an anomalous like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry .",
    "they find an excess of negatively - charged dimuon pair over positively charged ones , namely @xmath9 .",
    "reconstructing the events , and subtracting the backgrounds , they conclude that the only possible explanation is offered by the conjecture that a @xmath10 , created in a hard process , hadronize into a pair of neutral @xmath2-mesons ( say , @xmath11 ) each of which suffers a semileptonic [ @xmath12 decay .",
    "the oscillation of one into the other allows for a ` wrong - sign ' decay leading to like - sign dimuons .",
    "the asymmetry , then , would be a consequence of unequal probabilities of @xmath13 and @xmath14 oscillations , a manifestation of cp - noninvariance .",
    "thus , the d0 measurement@xcite , using @xmath15 of data , of @xmath16 would amount to a @xmath17 deviation away from the sm prediction of @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "the cdf collaboration @xcite , using @xmath19 of data has also measured @xmath20 with a positive central value , namely @xmath21 .",
    "because of the large errors in the cdf measurements , it is still compatible with the d0 one within @xmath22 level . combining the two , one obtains @xmath23 which still is @xmath24 away from the sm value .",
    "it should be noted at this stage that the like - sign charge asymmetry @xmath20 measured by d0 collaboration @xcite is related to the semileptonic decay asymmetries @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 mesons , respectively , through @xmath29 where @xmath30 the d0 collaboration has also directly measured @xmath26 , albeit with much large errors@xcite a^s_sl = -(1.7 9.1^+1.4_-1.5)10 ^ -3  , [ assl_d0 ] whereas the current direct bound on @xmath25 reads@xcite a^d_sl = ( 4.7 4.6)10 ^ -3  . [ adsl_hfag ] at this stage , it should be realized that , within the sm , @xmath25 would contribute negligibly to @xmath20 . and",
    "since the new physics ( np ) scenario that we would be considering entails almost a vanishingly small contribution to this quantity , it is meaningful to assume a sm value for the same .",
    "thus , combining all the data , we have@xcite a^s_sl -(12.7 5.0)10 ^ -3 .",
    "[ assl_comb ] this result is still @xmath31 away from the sm value@xcite , namely , a^s_sl0.02 10 ^ -3 .",
    "[ absl_sm ] while a discrepancy of this magnitude can not be considered a definitive discovery of np effects , it certainly adds to the existing list of deviations from the sm expectations seen in the @xmath32-sector .",
    "it , thus , becomes interesting to consider well - motivated np scenarios that might lead to an coherent explanation of such anomalies while leading itself to experimental verification in other independent channels @xcite .",
    "perhaps the simplest such extension is the postulation of a fourth family of quarks that mix with the three known families , thereby altering the structure of meson - mixings , cp violation , flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) etc .",
    ". a striking consequence of such a fourth family would be the introduction of additional phases in the analogue of the ckm matrix , or in other words , the existence of new jarlskog invariants  @xcite .",
    "as some of these are no longer suppressed by the first generation quark masses , there is an enormous enhancement in the effective magnitude of cp violation available to the mechanism of baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "although the addition of vector - representations of quarks is , in some sense , minimal and also suffices to explain the long - standing anomaly in the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath32-pair production at lep / slc  @xcite , the introduction of such representations typically results in tree - level fcncs  @xcite .",
    "we , rather , choose to work with the more canonical scenario , namely a chiral fourth generation @xmath33 quark model ( sm4 ) .",
    "the cdf collaboration has looked for the existence of such quarks and quote bounds of @xmath34  @xcite and @xmath35  @xcite respectively .",
    "however , as both these analyses assume a 100% decay branching fraction into particular modes , the model - independent bounds would be relaxed somewhat and heavy quarks of @xmath36 are still quite consistent . on the other hand ,",
    "the introduction of chiral fermions can cause deviations in electroweak precision test variables ( in particular , the custodial symmetry parameter @xmath37 ) from their sm values , and this severely constrains the allowed mass splitting between the quarks to @xmath38 gev  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section 2",

    "both @xmath165 and @xmath166 become relevant .",

    "it should also be realized that the presence of such quarks would enhance the @xmath168 cross section as well @xcite . while , for a light higgs , the experimentally important two - photon decay mode also suffers a change ,",
    "the last effect is not relevant for @xmath169 .",
    "to summarise , we have sought to explain the recently claimed evidence for an anomalous asymmetry in like - sign dimuon events by the d0 collaboration@xcite in terms of a possible four - generation extension of the standard model . while a degenerate fourth - family is protected from both electroweak precision tests as well as tree - level fcncs , the inclusion of such extra quarks , immediately leads to the possibility of additional quark - mixing , and , hence , to additional sources of cp - violation .",

    "if no other new physics effects are around the corner , then the lep and slc data on @xmath104 would disfavor two of the allowed regions .",
    "however , any such new physics effects and/or a shift in the values of the hadronic parameters ( such as @xmath171 ) would change this conclusion to a significant degree . as for @xmath108 transitions ,",
    "the solutions found herein are consistent with the data . given the large qcd uncertainties and the strong dependence on the scale at which the wilson coefficients are calculated , the constraints from this arena turns out to be not so crucial .    with a not too - heavy @xmath49 being favoured by the data , the prospects for detection at the lhc are very good .",
    "what is particularly interesting is that the preferred value of @xmath172 indicates that single production of @xmath49-quarks may be an interesting channel to consider . and",
    "while such modes do win over the qcd - driven process for very high @xmath100 values , it should be noted that such large yukawa couplings would tend to make the theory non - perturbative relatively early , thereby necessitating the introduction of other new physics , an eventuality also indicated by the electroweak precision tests . and",
    ", finally , the presence of such quarks would have a very important bearing on higgs physics , both in terms of enhancing the glue - glue fusion cross - section as well as through direct associated production ( with either of @xmath49 and @xmath137 ) rendering it quite important in the lhc context .",
    "in other words , if the d0 anomaly stands the test of time and if a fourth generation is the explanation of the same , the experiments at the lhc would soon be in a position to validate it .",
