    "coherent dynamical processes in complex systems have become popular in different fields of science , ranging from chemistry and statistical physics @xcite to quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the systems can be vastly different , say , optical waveguides @xcite , ultracold rydberg gases @xcite or carbon nanotube networks @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically as well as classically , transport in these systems takes place over different topologies which can vary from very ordered ( regular ) lattices to randomly build networks of interacting nodes .",
    "then , an excitation is created at one or more of the nodes : the dynamics of the excitation is then described in the classical ( diffusive ) case by continuous - time random walks ( ctrw ) and in the quantum case by continuous - time quantum walks ( ctqw ) @xcite .    in many cases one is interested in the transport _ through _ a network , i.e. , an excitation is created somewhere in the network and can leave the network at a given set of nodes . the topological influence on the dynamics",
    "is then captured in the survival probability of the excitation to remain within the network . here , we consider the example of a set of @xmath0 disconnected nodes arranged on two - dimensional lattices of different aspect ratios ( ar ) to which we randomly add a fixed number of bonds , @xmath1 , between axially nearest - neighboring nodes .",
    "this resembles the random two - dimensional lattices of nanotubes whose conductivity properties have been studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "there , the interest was in the conductivity from , say , the left side of the lattice to the right side .    in order to elucidate the transport properties of such networks ,",
    "we calculate for each @xmath1 the long - time behavior ( ltb ) of the survival probabilities for ctqw and compare them to the ones for ctqw .",
    "we define @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is that number of bonds , out of the total number @xmath4 , which is needed in order for the ltb of the ctqw survival probability to have reached ( roughly ) the value @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding ctrw probability is @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , for the same ar , @xmath7 and @xmath6 can be vastly different , as the quantum - mechanical localization of eigenstates may lead to higher @xmath8-values for ctqw than for ctrw , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a study of discrete - time quantum walks .    before continuing with our analysis we mention the obvious connection to percolation theory @xcite . while we focus on the survival probabilities and their decay due to existing connections from left to right , classical bond percolation focusses on the ( first ) appearance of such a connection . in our case ,",
    "typically several of these connections are needed in order to reach the values @xmath5 for the ltb of both , ctqw and ctrw .",
    "we further focus on the time - independent case where bonds are permanent , i.e. , they can not be removed from the lattice once they are placed . in dynamical percolation ,",
    "bonds might also be removed , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section introduces the general concepts of ctrw and of ctqw .",
    "furthermore , it discusses the trapping model and the different two - dimensional systems considered here .",
    "section displays our numerical results obtained for lattices with different ar for classical and for quantum mechanical transport .",
    "the paper ends in section with our conclusions .",
    "we start by considering both classical and quantum transport over two - dimensional structures consisting of @xmath9 nodes .",
    "we denote the position of a site by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 and @xmath14 are integers which label the lattice in the @xmath15- and the @xmath16-directions .",
    "several of these nodes get connected by the @xmath1-bonds distributed over the structure .",
    "this procedure leads to a group of clusters of sites .",
    "the information about these bonds is encoded in the @xmath17 connectivity matrix @xmath18 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the non - diagonal elements of @xmath19 : pertaining to two sites are @xmath20 if the sites are connected by one of the @xmath1-bonds and zero otherwise .",
    "the diagonal element of @xmath19 corresponding to a particular site is @xmath21 , where @xmath21 equals the number of @xmath1-bonds to which the particular site belongs .",
    "now , it is non - negative definite , i.e. all its eigenvalues are positive or zero .",
    "when the structure contains no disconnected parts , @xmath22 has a single vanishing eigenvalue @xcite . in the following",
    "we describe the dynamics of purely coherent and of purely incoherent transport by using the ctqw and the ctrw models , respectively @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the dynamics depends very much on the topology of the structure , i.e. , on @xmath23 . in a bra - ket notation",
    ", an excitation localized at node @xmath24 will be viewed as being in the state @xmath25 .",
    "the states @xmath26 form an orthonormal basis set .",
    "classically , the transport over unweighted and undirected graphs can be described by ctrw with the transfer matrix @xmath27 @xcite ; here , for simplicity , we assume equal transition rates @xmath28 for all the nodes .",
    "quantum mechanically , the set of states @xmath29 spans the whole accessible hilbert space . the time evolution of an excitation starting at node @xmath30 can be described by the discrete hamiltonian @xmath31 ; fahri and guttmann assumed in @xcite that @xmath32 which defines the ctqw corresponding to a ctrw with a given transfer matrix @xmath33 .",
    "the ctrw and the ctqw transition probabilities from the state @xmath30 at time @xmath34 to the state @xmath35 at time @xmath36 read @xcite :    @xmath37    respectively , where we assume @xmath38 in eq.([eq : trans_prob ] ) .",
    "an excitation does not necessarily stay forever in a particular system : it can either decay or get absorbed at certain sites . since we assume the lifetime of the excitation to be much longer than all the other relevant time scales , we neglect the global radiative decay . however , there are specific nodes where the excitation can get absorbed ( trapped ) .",
    "we call these nodes traps and denote their set by @xmath39 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath40 the number of elements in @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the presence of traps leads to the decay of the probability to find the excitation in the system as a function of time @xcite . for a trap - free structure",
    "we denote the transfer matrix and the hamiltonian by @xmath41 and by @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we assume the trapping operator @xmath43 to be given by a sum over all trap - nodes @xmath44 @xcite :    latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : trapping matrix }   \\hat{\\mathbf{\\gamma}}= \\sum_{m\\in\\mathcal{m } } \\gamma_m     then @xmath33 and @xmath31 can be written as @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the ctrw case",
    "the transfer matrix stays real ; then the transition probabilities can be calculated as :    @xmath48    in eq.([survprobctrw ] ) @xmath49 are the ( real ) eigenvalues @xmath49 and the @xmath50 are the eigenstates of @xmath51 .    in the quantum mechanical case , @xmath52 is non - hermitian and can have up to @xmath0 complex eigenvalues @xmath53 , ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "then the transition probabilities read :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the right and the left eigenstates of @xmath58 , respectively . obviously , the imaginary parts @xmath59 of @xmath60 determine the temporal decay of @xmath61 .",
    "we now turn to specific examples two - dimensional structures with different ar , see fig .",
    "[ fig : incond ] .",
    "we distinguish the structures by their aspect ratio @xmath62 ; in particular we denote the configurations of lattices with @xmath63 as `` landscapes '' and with @xmath64 as `` portraits '' ; the case @xmath65 is the square .",
    "as stated above , we start from a set of @xmath66 disconnected nodes , to which we randomly add @xmath1 bonds between nearest neighbor sites .",
    "this can be viewed as having bonds occupied with probability @xmath67 , with @xmath4 being @xmath68 . a simply connected component of this graph is called a cluster ; every two nodes of such a cluster are connected to each other by at least one unbroken chain of nearest - neighbors bonds",
    ".    -bonds are places on the horizontal and vertical connectivity segments . ]",
    "we now focus on the transport in the @xmath15-direction . for this",
    "we depict the sites in the first column of the lattice by triangles and call them sources ; their coordinates are @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , see fig .  [ fig : incond ] . in a similar way",
    ", we depict the nodes of the last column by squares and call them traps ( sinks ) .",
    "their coordinates are @xmath71 , see fig.[fig : incond ] .",
    "thus , @xmath72 .",
    "now , a typical process starts by exciting one of the sources .",
    "the process gets repeated by exciting another of the sources , and so forth .",
    "the classical and the quantum mechanical survival probabilities @xmath73 and @xmath74 are now :    @xmath75    and @xmath76 note that in this way @xmath77 and @xmath78 are averaged over all possible initial states @xmath69 and over all possible final states @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , the time evolution of @xmath77 and @xmath78 depends on the particular realization of the structure , since for a given , fixed @xmath1 the distribution of bonds and hence the structure is , in general , random .",
    "we evaluate interesting quantities through ensemble averaging over @xmath80 random structure realisations and set : @xmath81_r.\\ ] ] in such a way , we obtain ensemble - averaged survival probabilities @xmath82 and @xmath83 along with their long - time behavior ( ltb ) @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    as stressed above , our interest is to determine for which values of @xmath1 @xmath86 and @xmath87 reach the value @xmath5 .",
    "we denote these values by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , and obtain thus @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pcr ] summarises our findings for the classical @xmath92 and for the quantum @xmath93 as a function of the ar , namely of @xmath62 . in general",
    ", we find @xmath94 . for structures with @xmath63 , i.e. in landscape configurations , @xmath92 and @xmath93 behave quite similarly as a function of @xmath62 . now ,",
    "increasing @xmath62 we find that @xmath92 has a minimum at @xmath95 , which is not the case for @xmath93 . for structures with @xmath64 ,",
    "i.e. in portrait configurations , the behavior of @xmath92 and of @xmath93 differs with increasing ar : in the ctrw case @xmath92 decreases with increasing ar , reflecting the fact that the opposite ends get then closer , so that lower @xmath8-values are sufficient to ensure on efficient transport . in the ctqw case",
    "we find that for @xmath64 @xmath93 increases with increasing ar , a quite counter - intuitive effect which we will discuss in detail in the following .     and of @xmath93 for different ar , @xmath62 .",
    "note the logarithmic - linear scales . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : percolationexamples ] we show particular examples of the @xmath8-dependence of @xmath86 and @xmath87 for structures with different ar but with roughly the same total number @xmath0 of nodes .",
    "displayed are:(a ) a landscape configuration with @xmath96 nodes , ( b ) a square configuration with @xmath97 nodes , and ( c ) a portrait configuration with @xmath98 nodes . one observes as a function of @xmath8 the transition from states with very inhibited transport , for which @xmath86 and @xmath87 are very close to unity , to states in which the transport is very effective , so that @xmath86 and @xmath87 get very close to zero . from fig .",
    "[ fig : percolationexamples ] the values of @xmath92 and of @xmath93 may be read off . due to the finite size of the lattices",
    "the transition region is rather broad ; it gets sharper while increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the difference in behavior between @xmath99 and @xmath87 is most evident for the portrait configuration , see fig .",
    "[ fig : percolationexamples](c ) .",
    "furthermore , in the portrait case the ctrw @xmath86 is smaller than in the square and in the landscape configurations .",
    "this is different than for the ctqw case , where @xmath93 is larger than in the square and in the landscape configurations .    in the landscape configuration ,",
    "the limit @xmath100 leads to the situation of a very long ( infinite ) chain . in this case already",
    "one broken bond is enough to inhibit transport , this is in line with our findings , both in the classical and in the quantum mechanical cases , where we have @xmath101 .",
    "on the other hand , in the limit @xmath102 one finds that for ctrw only a small number of bonds @xmath1 , i.e. , a small probability @xmath8 is sufficient to cause a drop in @xmath86 .",
    "this is readily seen in the limit @xmath103 , when a horizontal bond is guaranteed in average when @xmath1 is around @xmath104 ( one has for @xmath103 roughly twice as many vertical as horizontal bonds ) , i.e. for @xmath105 .",
    "such a bond connects a source to a trap and this @xmath8 value , @xmath106 tends to zero as @xmath102 .",
    "the picture is not so simple in the ctqw case . here",
    ", the survival probability depends on specific features of the eigenstates @xmath107 .",
    "if these are localized , transport from one node to the other will be inhibited as in the anderson localization @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will analyze the eigenstates of @xmath108 in order to understand the relatively large values of @xmath93 compared to @xmath92 for lattices with portrait configurations .",
    "we recall that the participation ratio @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the @xmath111th eigenstate of the @xmath112th realization of the @xmath113 , is a measure of the localization of the different eigenstates . in order to take the ensemble averaging into account",
    ", we introduce @xmath114 as the ensemble averaged participation ratio @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : partratio ] shows in contour plots @xmath115 for lattices whose configuration is ( a ) landscape , ( b ) square , and ( c ) portrait . here , in each separate panel",
    "each row reflects the average contribution of every node @xmath30 of the lattice to a given eigenstate @xmath116 . in order to see the transition from the situation for @xmath117 to the one for @xmath118",
    ", we present @xmath115 for distinct @xmath8 values , namely for @xmath117 , for @xmath119 , for @xmath120 , for @xmath121 , and for @xmath118 .",
    "bright shadings correspond to low while dark shadings correspond to high values of @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , localized dark regions indicate localized eigenstates .",
    "these , in turn , will inhibit the transport .",
    "this is well in line with the information obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig : percolationexamples ] , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : percolationexamples](a ) for the landscape configuration .",
    "we ramark that , as already noticeable from fig .",
    "[ fig : percolationexamples](a ) , for the landscape configuration the quantum and the classical @xmath122-probabilities lie very close together , being @xmath123 and @xmath124 . in the depicted case @xmath92 and @xmath93 differ only by @xmath125 , i.e. , for @xmath126 only by @xmath127 bonds in @xmath128 .",
    "the eigenstates stray localized up to @xmath121 , see the first panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : partratio](a ) . for @xmath118",
    "the eigenstates get more delocalized , which is visible as the grey gets more evenly - distributed over the different nodes @xmath111 .    for the square configuration , fig .",
    "[ fig : partratio](b ) , the relative difference between @xmath92 and @xmath93 is about twice as large as for the landscape configuration . here",
    ", one notices a strong localization of the eigenstates for @xmath8-values up to @xmath92 , see the first two panels , while this effect is getting less pronounced for larger values of @xmath8 , this already indicates that quantum transport is strongly inhibited for @xmath8-values below and close to @xmath92 .",
    "this effect is even more enhanced for the portrait configuration , as may be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : partratio](c ) : up to @xmath92 one ramarks very strong localization .",
    "this persists even up to @xmath129 which value is more than twice as large as @xmath130 . in this particular example",
    "one has @xmath126 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "this means that one needs more than twice more bonds in order to render the quantum transport as efficient as the classical one , in this particular portrait configuration . for smaller @xmath1 values , the eigenstates are too localized for the quantum transport to be efficient",
    "we have studied the coherent , continuous - time quantum transport on two - dimensional structures of different aspect ratios @xmath62 with a given , fixed number @xmath1 of randomly placed bonds .",
    "having focused on three types of configurations  landscape , square , and portrait  we investigated the long - time probability for an excitation not to get trapped .",
    "our analysis shows that in the average the quantum excitation transport in the @xmath15-direction becomes very inefficient for structures with portrait configurations , i.e. , for those where @xmath133 .",
    "this is particularly remarkable , since the opposite holds for ( incoherent ) continuous - time random walks , where the transport becomes more efficient when the @xmath134 increases .",
    "this is rendered clear by our evaluations of the classical and quantum mechanical probabilities @xmath92 and @xmath93 which we have introduced in this article .",
    "the behavior in the quantum case can be understood based on an analysis of the corresponding eigenstates .",
    "their participation ratios show that in portrait configurations the eigenstates are still localized for probabilities @xmath8 such that @xmath135 . only for",
