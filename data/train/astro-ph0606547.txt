    "this value should be more appropriate for a star - forming than for a prestellar core .",
    "however , due to slightly different beamsizes the accuracy of the present determination of the @xmath6/@xmath77  ratio is not sufficient for distinguishing between the two cases .",
    "@xcite suggested that the large @xmath78  abundance observed in cha - mms1 indicates either a so called late - time cyanopolyyne peak associated with a large degree of depletion according to the model of @xcite , or carbon chemistry revival by the influence of a newly born , so far undetected star .",
    "a large ammonia abundance can be understood in either case .",
    "ammonia production benefits from the diminishing of co and can resist depletion longer ( e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", ammonia can possibly form on grain surfaces and be released into the gas phase in shocks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . as there is no clear evidence for star - cloud interaction in cha - mms1 , the alternative that the core - or the portion traced by the present observations - represents",
    "matured pre - stellar chemistry is more likely .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath1  and @xmath2  under these circumstances is not clear .",
    "the main gas - phase production pathway via the hcnh@xmath19 , which is effective especially at later stages , requires @xmath6  and c@xmath19 ions .",
    "the latter can be produced also in deep interiors of molecular clouds via the cosmic ray ionization of c atoms , or in the reaction between co and the he@xmath19 ion , the latter mechanism becoming less important with co depletion ( @xcite ) . to our knowledge",
    "the production of @xmath1  and @xmath2  on interstellar grains and their desorption has not been studied .",
    "the models of @xcite for collapsing prestellar cores include the gas - phase production of @xmath1 , @xmath78 , @xmath6 , and @xmath77 .",
    "although the order of fractional abundances , @xmath85 , and the @xmath6/@xmath77  abundance ratio derived from the present observations are well reproduced by this model , especially for the gravity - to - pressure ratio @xmath86 impying a rapid collapse and less marked depletion , the predicted @xmath1  column densities relative to @xmath6  and @xmath77  are an order of magnitude larger than those observed here .",
    "a likely explanation is that @xmath1  is not as centrally peaked than @xmath6  and @xmath77  ( see fig .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore a large fraction of @xmath1  resides in on the outskirts of the core , where the density is not sufficient for the collisional excitation of its rotational levels , and the molecule is not seen in emission ( see also the next section ) .",
    "another discrepancy is that the model predicts much lower @xmath78  column densities relative to ammonia than observed here .",
    "the agreement is slightly better for the model with overwhelmingly large gravitational potential ( @xmath86 ) than for the slowly evolving model near hydrostatic equilibrium ( @xmath87 ) which results in very high degrees of depletion .",
    "unfortunately the spectral resolution and s / n ratio of the present data do not allow to study the core kinematics .",
    "as compared to the principal n - bearing molecules @xmath6  and @xmath78 , @xmath1  and @xmath2  have clearly smaller abundances , and probably only marginal importance to the nitrogen chemistry in the core .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that @xmath2/@xmath1  abundance ratio is once again observed to be larger than unity remains a problem .",
    "@xcite have shown that even though the reaction between @xmath6  and c@xmath19 may produce a significant amount of the metastable ion @xmath88 , which should produce only @xmath2  in electron recombination , the energy released in the former reaction leads to the efficient transformation into the linear isomer @xmath89 before the recombination . likewise , according to @xcite , the vibrational energies of @xmath2  and @xmath1  formed in the _ neutral _ reactions @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are sufficient to overcome the isomerization barrier , and roughly equal amounts of both isomers are produced .",
    "the theoretical results presented in @xcite and @xcite , and more recently by @xcite and @xcite , show quite convincingly that the @xmath2/@xmath1abundance ratio resulting from the chemical reactions known to be effective in dark clouds _ can not _ differ significantly from unity .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the discrepancy between the observations and theoretical predictions .",
    "either so far unknown processes favour @xmath2  in the cost of @xmath1 , or then the derived @xmath3/@xmath4  column density ratio is affected by different degrees of @xmath11c fractionation in @xmath2  and @xmath1 . in the latter case @xmath11c",
    "would about three times more enhanced in @xmath2  than in @xmath1 in cha - mms1 .",
    "the @xmath3/@xmath5  column density ratio 7.4 together with the above quoted range of @xmath44n/@xmath9n ratios imply that the @xmath2/@xmath3ratio in cha - mms1 is in the range @xmath10 . as the typical @xmath32c/@xmath11c isotopic ratio observed in nearby clouds",
    "is 60 ( @xcite ) the result suggests considerable @xmath11c enhancement in @xmath2 .",
    "an @xmath92  column density determination would readily show , according to the results of @xcite , whether also @xmath1  has a similar degree of @xmath11c fractionation .    in the only survey",
    "so far including all these isotopologues , @xcite found very similar @xmath3/@xmath5  and @xmath4/@xmath92  intensity ratios ( @xmath93 ) towards tmc-1 .",
    "this observation suggests similar @xmath11c fractionation in @xmath1  and @xmath2 . on the other hand",
    ", this result might not be universally valid .",
    "@xcite determined substantially different @xmath4/@xmath92column density ratios in the starless dark cloud cores l1521e , tmc-1 , and l1498 , listed in order of increasing @xmath4/@xmath92  ratio ( 2.6 , 6.7 , and 11 ) .",
    "the @xmath3/@xmath4  column density ratios in these sources increase in the same order ( 0.54 , 1.7 , and 4.5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the values obtained towards tmc-1 are consistent with those of @xcite , but the results towards l1521e and l1498 suggest ( if the possibility of @xmath9n fractionation is neglected ) that the @xmath11c fractionation in @xmath1  changes from source to source , and perhaps the variation in the case of @xmath2  is even larger .",
    "l1521e is suggested to represent youthful chemistry with little molecular depletion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) whereas the position observed in l1498 is known to be heavily depleted ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it appears that the freeze - out of molecules favour the @xmath11c substituted isotopologues of @xmath1  and @xmath2 .",
    "it seems warranted to further examine the possibility of their differential @xmath11c fractionation , although no theoretical arguments are in favour of different gas - phase production and destruction rates of @xmath3  and @xmath4 , or their different freezing rates . as no empirical data on this matter",
    "is currently available , the best way to proceed is probably to perform similar observations as those done by @xcite towards a sample of cores with different degree of depletion .",
    "the low @xmath1/@xmath4  and @xmath2/@xmath3  intensity ratios and the line shapes in the @xmath1  and @xmath2  spectra observed towards the centre of the core require some attention .",
    "the intensity ratios suggest very large optical thicknesses for the @xmath1  and @xmath2lines , and consequently , deep self - absorption features and anomalous hyperfine component ratios are to be expected .",
    "a clear absorption feature can be seen in the _ simulated _",
    "@xmath1  spectrum shown in fig .",

    "the _ observed _",
    "@xmath1and @xmath2  spectra are , however , free from absorption dips , and they look more like weakened normal lines .",
    "this weakening can probably be attributed to less dense gas surrounding the core .",
    "the @xmath1  and @xmath2  molecules in the envelope , where the density lies below the critical density of their @xmath0 lines , function as scatterers of line emission arising from the core , i.e. they re - emit absorbed photons ( into random directions ) before colliding with other particles .",
    "the effect is less marked for @xmath11c isotopologues , and the resulting @xmath1/@xmath4  and @xmath2/@xmath3intensity ratios decrease , without @xmath1  and @xmath2  loosing their characteristic line patterns .",
    "this model was used by @xcite to explain @xmath1  hyperfine anomalies , particularly the intesity of the intrinsically weakest component @xmath43 observed towards dark clouds .",
    "the @xmath1  spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ figure:5spectra ] conforms with this explanation : the @xmath43 component on the left is stronger than @xmath94 component on the right , although the optically thin lte ratio is @xmath95 .",
    "the scattering of @xmath1  emission from the core has probably lead to underestimation of the excitation temperature and column densities derived using the lte method in sect .  3.2 .",
    "for example , an increase of 1 k in @xmath96 , would mean 30 % larger column densities , and 3 k would correspond to a 100% increase in the column density .",
    "quantitative estimates of the scattering effects are , however , beyond the scope of this paper , and here we merely note this additional source of error .",

    "the column density determinations of @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath5  and @xmath6 , and the results of the quoted two studies allow us to estimate that the fractional @xmath1  and @xmath2  abundances are @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "these are slightly larger than that of @xmath77 , but clearly smaller than the @xmath6  and @xmath78  abundances ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively ) . in accordance with recent results in other dense cores",
    "we find that @xmath6  is about 100 times more abundant than @xmath77 .",
    "the kinetic temperature derived from the @xmath6  lines is about 12 k. the derived fractional abundances conform with the previous suggestion of @xcite , that cha - mms1 represents an advanced chemical state , although it has a large @xmath78abundance , which usually is thought to indicate early times .",
    "this situation is likely to have developed under the circumstances of co depletion ( @xcite ) .",

    ", we estimate that the [ @xmath2]/[@xmath3 ] ratio is between 30 and 40 . as there is no @xmath92  column density determination available towards this source , the possibility that differential @xmath11c fractionation causes the observed relatively high [ @xmath3]/[@xmath4 ] ratio can not be entirely ruled out .",
    "the @xmath1  and @xmath2  lines are not much brighter than those of the @xmath11c substituted species , but still show no absorption dips .",
    "these lines are probably weakened by scattering by @xmath1  and @xmath2  molecules residing in less dense gas around the core . as suggested by @xcite",

    "<S> the core was mapped in the @xmath0 rotational lines of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the column densities of @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath5and @xmath6  were estimated towards the centre of the core .    </S>",
    "<S> _ results . _ </S>",
    "<S> the core is well delineated in all three maps . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic temperature in the core , derived from the @xmath6  ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion lines , is @xmath7 k. the @xmath3/@xmath4  column density ratio is between 3 and 4 , i.e. similar to values found in several other cold cores . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3/@xmath5  column density ratio is @xmath8 . in case </S>",
    "<S> no @xmath9n fractionation occurs in @xmath2  ( as suggested by recent modelling results ) , the @xmath2/@xmath3  abundance ratio is in the range @xmath10 , which indicates a high degree of @xmath11c fractionation in @xmath2 . assuming no differential @xmath11c fractionation the @xmath1  and @xmath2  abundances are estimated to be @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , the former being nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath6 . using also previously determined column densities in cha - mms1 </S>",
    "<S> , we can put the most commonly observed nitrogenous molecules in the following order according to their fractional abundances : @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> _ the relationships between molecular abundances suggest that cha - mms1 represents an evolved chemical stage , experiencing at present the late - time cyanopolyyne peak . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility that the relatively high hnc / hcn ratio derived here is only valid for the @xmath11c isotopic substitutes can not be excluded on the basis of the present and other available data .    </S>",
