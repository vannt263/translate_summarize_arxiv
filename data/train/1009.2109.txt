    "graphs are widely used to depict relations between objects . there",
    "exist several criteria that have been used to judge the quality of a graph drawing @xcite . from a human point of view",
    ", it is necessary to obtain drawings that are easy - to - read , i.e. , they should nicely convey the structure of the objects and their relationships . from an algorithmic point of view ,",
    "the quality of a drawing is usually evaluated by some objective function and the main task is to determine a drawing that minimizes or maximizes the specific objective function .",
    "various such functions have been studied by the graph drawing community , among them , the number of crossings among pairs of edges , the number of edge bends , the maximum edge length , the total area occupied by the drawing and so on .    over the last few decades",
    ", much research effort has been devoted to the problem of reducing the number of crossings .",
    "this is reasonable , since it is commonly accepted that edge crossings may negatively affect the quality of a drawing . towards this direction , there also exist eye - tracking experiments that confirm the negative impact of edge crossings on the human understanding of a graph drawing @xcite .",
    "however , the computational complexity of the edge crossing minimization problem , which is @xmath1-complete in general @xcite , implies that the computation of high - quality drawings of dense graph is difficult to achieve .",
    "apart from the edge crossings , another undesired property that may negatively influence the readability of a drawing is the presence of edges that are too close to each other , especially if these edges are adjacent .",
    "thus , maximizing the angles among incident edges becomes an important aesthetic criterion , since there is some correlation between the involved angles and the visual distinctiveness of the edges .",
    "motivated by the cognitive experiments by huang et al.@xcite that indicate that the negative impact of an edge crossing is eliminated in the case where the crossing angle is greater than @xmath2 degrees , we study a new graph drawing scenario in which both _",
    "angular _ and _ _ crossing resolution _ _ are taken into account in order to produce a straight - line drawing of a given graph . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first attempt , where both angular and crossing resolution are combined to produce drawings .",
    "we prove that the classes of complete and complete bipartite graphs admit drawings that asymptotically maximize the minimum of the angular and crossing resolution ( section  [ sec : complete - graphs ] ) .",
    "we also present a more practical , force - directed based algorithm that constructs drawings of large angular and crossing resolution ( section  [ sec : force - directed - algorithm ] ) .",

    "angelini et al .",
    "@xcite showed that there are acyclic planar digraphs not admitting straight - line upward rac drawings and that the corresponding decision problem is @xmath1-hard .",
    "they also constructed digraphs whose straight - line upward rac drawings require exponential area .",

    "for this class of graphs , they proved upper and lower bounds for the number of edges .",
    "force - directed methods are commonly used for drawing graphs @xcite . in such a framework ,",
    "a graph is treated as a physical system with forces acting on it .",

    "in this section , we define the total resolution of a drawing and we present drawings of asymptotically optimal total resolution for complete graphs ( circular drawings ) and complete bipartite graphs ( @xmath0-layered drawings ) .",
    "the _ total resolution _ of a drawing is defined as the minimum of its angular and crossing resolution .",

    "our aim is to construct a circular drawing of @xmath43 of maximum total resolution .",
    "our approach is constructive and common when dealing with complete graphs . a similar",
    "one has been given by formann et al .",
    "@xcite for obtaining optimal drawings of complete graphs , in terms of angular resolution .",
    "consider a circle @xmath44 of radius @xmath45 centered at @xmath46 and circumscribe a regular @xmath7-polygon @xmath47 on @xmath44 . in our construction ,",
    "the nodes of @xmath43 coincide with the vertices of @xmath47 . w.l.o.g .",
    ", we further assume that @xmath48 appear in this order in the counter - clockwise direction around @xmath46 , as illustrated in fig.[fig : complete - case ] .    a complete graph @xmath43 admits a drawing of total resolution @xmath49 .",
    "[ thm : complete - total - resolution ]    we prove that the angular resolution of the presented drawing of @xmath43 is @xmath50 , whereas its crossing resolution is @xmath51 .",
    "first , observe that the arc of circle @xmath44 that connects two consecutive nodes @xmath52 and @xmath53 is equal to @xmath51 , for each @xmath54 . therefore , the angular resolution of the drawing is @xmath50 , as desired .",
    "let now @xmath55 and @xmath56 be two crossing edges . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath57 , as in fig.[fig : complete - case ] . the crossing of @xmath58 and @xmath59 defines two angles @xmath60 and @xmath61 such that @xmath62 . in fig.[fig :",

    "similarly , we can prove that the minimum value of @xmath61 is also @xmath51 .",
    "this establishes that the crossing resolution is @xmath51 .",
    "we now proceed to consider the class of complete bipartite graphs .",
    "since an @xmath7-vertex complete bipartite graph is a subgraph of a @xmath7-vertex complete graph , the bound of the total resolution of a complete bipartite graph can be implied by the bound of the complete graph . however , if the nodes of the graph must have integer coordinates , i.e. , we restrict ourselves on grid drawings , few results are known regarding the area needed of such a drawing .",
    "an upper bound of @xmath70 area can be implied by @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to separately study the class of complete bipartite graph , since we can drastically improve this bound .",

    "consider now the case where the nodes of the graph must have integer coordinates , i.e. , we restrict ourselves on grid drawings .",
    "an interesting problem that arises in this case is the estimation of the total area occupied by the produced drawing .",
    "we will describe how we can modify the positions of the nodes produced by our algorithm in order to obey the grid constraints .",
    "assume without loss of generality that @xmath72 and @xmath73 are two horizontal lines , so that @xmath73 coincides with @xmath158-axis and the drawing produced by our algorithm has @xmath159 .",

    ", we move the horizontal line @xmath72 to the horizontal grid line immediately above it and each node of both @xmath76 and @xmath77 to the rightmost grid - point to its left . in this manner",
    ", we obtain a new drawing @xmath163 , which is grid as desired . by lemma  [ lem : line - segment - comparison ]",

    "we present a force - directed algorithm that given a reasonably nice initial drawing , probably produced by a classical force - directed algorithm , results in a drawing of high total resolution .",
    "the algorithm reinforces the classical force - directed algorithm of eades @xcite with some additional forces exerted to the nodes of the graph .",
    "more precisely , these additional forces involve springs and some extra attractive or repulsive forces on nodes with degree greater than one and on end - nodes of edges that are involved in an edge crossing .",
    "this aims to ensure that the angles between incident edges and the angles formed by pairs of crossing edges will be as large as possible .",
    "the classical force - directed algorithm of eades @xcite models the nodes of the graph as electrically charged particles that repel each other , and its edges by springs in order to attract adjacent nodes . in our approach ,",
    "we use only the attractive forces of the force - directed algorithm of eades ( denoted by @xmath170 ) , which follow the formula :    @xmath171    where @xmath172 and @xmath173 capture the stiffness and the natural length of the springs , respectively . recall that @xmath21 denotes the unit length vector from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",

    "the time complexity can be improved using standard techniques from computational geometry @xcite . if @xmath242 is the number of pairwise - crossing edges , then the @xmath242 intersections can be reported in @xmath243 time @xcite , which leads to a total complexity @xmath244 per iteration .      in this section",

    "the experiment was performed as follows .",
    "first , each rome graph was laid out using the smartorganic layouter of yfiles .",
    "this layout was the input layout for all three algorithms , in order to speed up the experiment and overcome problems associated with local minimal traps especially in large graphs .",
    "if both the angular and the crossing resolution between two consecutive iterations of each algorithm were not improved more that 0.001 degrees , we assumed that the algorithm has converged and we did not proceed any more .",
    "the maximum number of iterations that an algorithm could perform in order to converge was 100.000 .",
    "we note that the termination condition is quite strict and demands a large number of iterations .",
    "our algorithm is evaluated as ( a )  crossing - only , ( b )  angular - only and ( c )  mixed .",

    "our experimental analysis shows that our angular - only algorithm achieves , on average , better angular resolution .",
    "the angular resolution of our mixed algorithm is almost equal , on average , to the one of lin and yen .",
    "note that the algorithm of lin and yen , in contrast to ours , does not modify the embedding of the initial layout  @xcite ( i.e. , it needs a close - to - final starting layout and improve on it ) .",
    "this explains why our mixed algorithm achieves almost the same performance , in terms of angular resolution , as the one of lin and yen . in @xmath249% of the graphs our mixed algorithm yields a better solution compared to lin - yen s algorithm with an average improvement of @xmath250 .",

    "_ the total resolution maximization problem : _ refer to fig.[fig : total - resolution ] .",
    "this is the most important result of our experimental analysis .",
    "it indicates that our mixed algorithm applied on graphs with more than @xmath252 nodes constructs drawings with total resolution of @xmath253 degrees , on average .",
    "note that this is an achievement on average and under the particular termination condition discussed above , i.e. , there is no guarantee , that it would be maintained indefinitely .",
    "an example is given in fig.[fig : grafo1012999 ] .",
    "finally , fig.[fig : algorithm - time ] summarizes the running time performance of the algorithms .",
    "our algorithm needs , on average , @xmath254 milliseconds and @xmath255 iterations to converge , whereas the one of lin and yen @xmath256 and @xmath257 , respectively .",
    "note that the time complexity of lin - yen s algorithm is better than ours .",
    "however , the termination condition takes into account the crossing improvement and therefore the algorithm of lin and yen needs more iterations to converge , which explains this contradiction .",

    "of course , our work leaves several open problems .",
    "it would be interesting to try to identify other classes of graphs that admit optimal drawings .",
