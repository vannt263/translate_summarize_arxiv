    "this paper gives a geometric characterization of the arf invariant of a knotted circle in the 3sphere that is related to recent developments in knot theory .",

    "gropes are built by gluing together embedded surfaces and in this setting the vassiliev degree corresponds to a measure of grope complexity called _ class _ , which counts the layers of attached surfaces .",
    "the arf invariant @xmath1 of a knot @xmath2 is the mod 2 reduction of the lowest degree nontrivial vassiliev invariant ( the degree two coefficient of the conway polynomial of @xmath3 ) and a result of ng ( @xcite ) says that @xmath4 is the only finite type invariant of @xmath3 up to _ concordance _ , that is , up to bordism of @xmath3 by an embedded annulus in the product @xmath5 of the 3sphere with an interval .",
    "gropes have been extensively studied in 4dimensional topology ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and are closely related to _",

    "the following theorem illustrates geometrically how , in the setting of knot concordance , the vassiliev isotopy invariants `` collapse '' to the arf invariant and the failure of the whitney move can be `` pushed out '' to arbitrarily high order whitney disks :    [ arf - thm ] for knots @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath0 the following are equivalent :    1 .",

    "whitney towers are of interest in their own right , in part because an order @xmath13 whitney tower comes equipped with an @xmath9th order geometric intersection obstruction to the existence of an @xmath9th order tower which is related to milnor s ( @xmath14 ) link invariants and the reduced kontsevich integral ( @xcite ) .",
