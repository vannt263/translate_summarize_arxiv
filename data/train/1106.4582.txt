    "we consider _ join the shortest queue _ ( jsq ) networks , where incoming  jobs \" ( or  customers \" ) are assigned to the shortest queue from among @xmath0 distinct queues , @xmath14 , with these queues being chosen uniformly from among the @xmath1 queues in the system , with @xmath15 .",
    "when two or more of these queues each have the fewest number of jobs , each of the queues is chosen with equal probability .",

    "we are interested in this article in the case where the service discipline at each queue is first - in , first - out ( fifo ) .",
    "when the service at queues is exponentially distributed , the evolution of the system is given by a countable state markov chain where a state is given by the number of jobs at each queue .",

    "little work has been done on the behavior of jsq networks when the service times are not exponentially distributed . in this",
    "setting , the underlying markov process will typically have an uncountable state space , and positive harris recurrence for the process is no longer obvious .",
    "the latter was shown in foss - chernova @xcite , and uniform bounds on the equilibria were shown in bramson @xcite .",
    "( both articles also considered jsq networks with more general arrivals and routing of jobs . )",
    "an important first step in analyzing the limiting behavior of the equilibria , as @xmath7 , is to show that any fixed number of queues become independent of one another and converge to a limiting distribution .",
    "moreover , one wishes to show that such a limiting distribution is the unique equilibrium for an associated markov process at a single queue , the _ environment process _ , which corresponds in an appropriate sense to  setting @xmath19 and viewing the corresponding infinite dimensional process at a single queue .",
    "we will refer to this equilibrium as the _ equilibrium environment_. in section 2 , we will precisely define this terminology .",
    "although it seems that this independence should hold in a very general setting , including under a wide range of service disciplines , demonstrating it appears to be a difficult problem . in bramson",
    "@xcite , this independence and the corresponding behavior for the environment process were stated as an ansatz .",

    ", we summarize it for application in the current section : @xmath20 although this ansatz has only been demonstrated for service distributions having decreasing hazard rate and for general service distributions with sufficiently small @xmath21 for arrivals , our arguments here do not otherwise require either restriction .",
    "other applications of the ansatz , but for the processor sharing and lifo service disciplines , are given in @xcite .    our goal , in this article , is to investigate the limiting behavior of the right tail of the associated equilibrium environment , under the fifo service discipline and with the assigned mean-@xmath4 service distribution @xmath22 . denote by @xmath23 the probability that there are at least @xmath17 jobs in the equilibrium environment .",
    "we will show that , when @xmath22 has a power law tail with exponent @xmath8 , for given @xmath9 , the tail of @xmath23 exhibits a wide range of behavior depending on the relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
