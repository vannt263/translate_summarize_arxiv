    "the commissioning of the 4 m telescope at cerro tololo ( now the blanco telescope ) included a new wide field grating / prism developed by blanco @xcite at the prime focus , permitting large scale surveys yielding slitless spectra at classification resolution .",

    "the discovery and spectral classification of hundreds of m giants in the baade s window field @xcite identified large numbers of m giants with spectral types later than m4 and as cool as m9 .",
    "such cool luminous stars are not found in globular clusters , so this characteristic of the bulge population was immediately understood at the time to contradict the dominant view of the bulge being a metal poor , population ii system . using the identifications of @xcite , @xcite obtained infrared photometry from which they obtained effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities ( reaching as bright as @xmath7 ) of the bulge m giant population .",
    "even at high resolution , m giants are difficult to study using optical abundance analysis due to their severe molecular blanketing . while @xcite and subsequent studies perform high resolution abundance analysis of of the bulge k giants , the composition of the baade s window m giants which includes stars as late as m9 , continues to remain as an unsolved problem . because stars like these are a major contributor to the integrated light of elliptical galaxies , the study of these stars has broader implications .",
    "during the 1980 s , the indications of a wide abundance spread in the bulge from the presence of both rr lyrae and late m giant stars was confirmed from the study of the k giants @xcite .",

    "especially , one would very much like to see abundances measured from high resolution spectra as the gradient in composition remains unconstrained .",
    "when the commissioning of nirspec @xcite on keck ii made it possible to obtain high dispersion infrared spectroscopy , we decided to obtain spectra of the baade s window m giants .",
    "having established abundances for the m giants in baade s window , our aim is to extend our study to include the population of old late - type giants closer to the galactic center .",
    "while all low mass stars ascend the first giant branch , only the most metal rich stars might be expected to become m giants .",
    "are the m giants the progeny of the most metal rich , or perhaps the most alpha - enhanced , bulge stars ?",
    "given their high luminosities , are the m giants be a separate , perhaps younger , stellar population ?",
    "detailed abundance analysis plays a critical role in answering these questions . here",

    "the fainter k giants ( i-195 and i-194 ) required a total of 1800 sec of exposure time , as they are typically 3 - 4 mag fainter .",
    "we nod the star by 5 - 10 arcsec to take at least two separate exposures .",
    "the m giants were frequently observed in conditions of less than ideal seeing and transparency .",

    "these discrepancies are most likely due to differences in the temperature structure of the model atmospheres which however have a minor impact on the overall inferred abundances . to test this , we analyzed the 3600k m giant bmb93 using both atmospheres , finding numerical results for [ fe / h ] and o , si , m , ca , ti , and c / fe in agreement to within 0.02 dex .",

    "<S> we report the first abundance analysis of 14 m giant stars in the galactic bulge , based on @xmath0 infrared spectroscopy @xmath1 using nirspec at the keck telescope . because some of the bulge m giants reach high luminosities and have very late spectral type , it has been suggested that they are the progeny of only the most metal rich bulge stars , or possibly members of a younger bulge population . </S>",
    "<S> we find the iron abundance and composition of the m giants are similar to those of the k giants that have abundances determined from optical high resolution spectroscopy : @xmath2 \\rangle = -0.190 \\pm 0.020 $ ] , with a @xmath3 dispersion of @xmath4 . comparing our bulge m giants to a control sample of local disk m giants in the solar vicinity , we find the bulge stars are enhanced in @xmath5-elements at the level of + 0.3 dex relative the solar composition stars , consistent with other studies of bulge globular clusters and field stars . </S>",
    "<S> this small sample shows no dependence of spectral type on metallicity , nor is there any indication that the m giants are the evolved members of a subset of the bulge population endowed with special characteristics such as relative youth or high metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we also find low @xmath6 , confirming the presence of extra - mixing processes during the red giant phase of evolution . </S>"
