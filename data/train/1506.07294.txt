    "a common feature of all these film systems is that the rock salt unit cells of these materials have only one sort of atomic sublayer in the ( 001)-plane . here , we focus on hausmannit ( mn@xmath0o@xmath1 ) a spinel with a stack of 8 sublayers and a jahn - teller distortion of the unit cell in c direction .",

    "this means that the ( @xmath5 ) unit mesh is rotated by 45@xmath3 resulting in a ( @xmath6 ) leed pattern with respect to the mno(001 ) substrate .",
    "such a 45@xmath3 rotation has also been observed for other film - substrate combinations , e.g. , lif , kcl , and nai on mgo(001 ) @xcite and nacl on ag(001 ) @xcite . according to the roles of lattice fitting in epitaxy @xcite",

    "manganese was evaporated from ta crucibles heated by electron bombardment .",
    "the deposition rate of 30  pm ( i.e. 0.03  ml ) per minute was calibrated by means of a quartz microbalance , aes , leed , and stm and controlled by monitoring the flux of mn ions as reported previously @xcite .",
    "the deposition was performed at sample temperatures between room temperature and 450  k.    the integral structure of the as grown mn@xmath0o@xmath1 films was characterized by leed .",

    "the resulting lowering of the symmetry from cubic to tetragonal might explain the small differences in fig .",
    "[ fig : nexafs ] at 533  ev .",
    "in addition , the reduced coordination of mn ions in the top surface layer and in the bottom layer at the interface to the ag substrate can contribute to this anisotropy .    in order to obtain the oxygen richer mn@xmath0o@xmath1 films , the o@xmath13 pressure during mn evaporation",

    "the mn@xmath0o@xmath1 film of fig . [ fig : nexafs ] , therefore , has a thickness of 6.7 unit cells or about 50 sublayers .",

    "the presence of @xmath26-mn@xmath13o@xmath0 can clearly be ruled out , since its characteristic resonance at 542  ev is missing in [ fig : nexafs]b . instead , the two resonances at 539.4 and 540.8  ev and the one at 548  ev are characteristic for mn@xmath0o@xmath1 and not present at all in @xmath26-mn@xmath13o@xmath0 .",
    "however , the spectra of @xmath27-mn@xmath13o@xmath0 and mn@xmath0o@xmath1 are very similar and can hardly be distinguished @xcite .",
    "this similarity originates in nearly identical geometric structures with no difference in bond lengths and angles .",
    "the only difference is the occupation of octahedral and tetrahedral sites by mn ions and @xmath27-mn@xmath13o@xmath0 can be considered as a vacancy structure of mn@xmath0o@xmath1 , whereby the occupation of octahedral or tetrahedral sites has not fully been resolved .",

    "@xcite and octahedral vacancies by sinha et al .",
    "@xcite ) which have not been further investigated later on .",
    "our subsequent discussion will be based on the vacancy - less structure of mn@xmath0o@xmath1 , because we started from growth conditions for mno and slowly increased the oxygen pressure .",
    "mn@xmath0o@xmath1 is expected to be formed prior to mn@xmath13o@xmath0 due to its lower oxygen content .",
    "compared to the nexafs spectra of mno , the absorption onset in the mn@xmath0o@xmath1 spectra is shifted characteristically to a lower photon energy .",
    "since this edge is very prominent , its absence in the first spectrum clearly rules out even small amounts of mn@xmath0o@xmath1 in the mno film .",
    "contrary to mno , the nexafs spectra of the mn@xmath0o@xmath1 film strongly depend on the angle of light incidence . taking into account that the bulk structure of mn@xmath0o@xmath1 has a tetragonal unit cell ( fig .",
    "[ fig : unitcell ] ) with different atomic arrangements of o ions around mn ions , the dependence of the x - ray absorption on the angle of incidence indicates directly a c - axis alignment of the mn@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) film .",
    "since the shorter a axis of mn@xmath0o@xmath1 matches better to the lattice of the substrate , preferential alignment of the c - axis normal to the surface is assumed .",
    "the initial stages of film growth for mn@xmath0o@xmath1 on ag(001 ) at a substrate temperature of 450 k have been characterized by stm .",
    "after the deposition of 0.1  nm mn@xmath0o@xmath1 , two different island types can be distinguished in stm images as shown in fig .",

    "one type of islands is of rectangular shape and has a well - resolved striped atomic pattern pointing along [ 110 ] directions .",
