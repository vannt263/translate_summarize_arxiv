    "initiated by the seminal work of gupta and kumar  @xcite , the studies for understanding the capacities of wireless ad hoc networks have made great progresses . considering @xmath0 nodes that are randomly distributed in a unit area and grouped independently into one - to - one source - destination ( s - d ) pairs , gupta and kumar  @xcite showed that a typical time - slotted multi - hop architecture with a common transmission range and adjacent - neighbor communication can achieve a sum throughput that scales as @xmath1 . by using percolation theory , franceschetti _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath2 sum throughput scaling is achievable . in  @xcite , grossglauser and",
    "tse showed that by allowing the nodes to move independently and uniformly , a constant throughput scaling @xmath3 per s - d pair can be achieved . in  @xcite , baccelli _",
    "et  al . _",
    "proposed a multi - hop spatial reuse aloha protocol . by optimizing the product between the number of simultaneous successful transmissions per unit area and the average transmission range , they showed that the transport capacity is proportional to the square root of the node density , which achieves the upper bound of gupta and kumar  @xcite .",
    "et al _ in  @xcite derived the upper and lower bounds on transmission capacity of spread - spectrum wireless ad hoc networks , where the transmission capacity is defined as the product between the maximum density of successful transmissions and the corresponding data rate , under a constraint on the outage probability .",
    "all the above results focus on the capacity of a single ad hoc wireless network . in recent years , due to the scarcity and poor utilization of spectrum , the regulation bodies are beginning to consider the possibility of permitting secondary ( sr ) networks to coexist with licensed primary ( pr ) networks , which is the main driving force behind the cognitive radio technology  @xcite . in cognitive radio networks ,",
    "the pr users have a higher priority to access the spectrum and the sr users need to operate conservatively such that their interference to the pr users is limited below an `` acceptable level '' . in this overlaid regime , the capacity or throughput scaling laws for both of the pr and sr networks are interesting problems .",
    "recently , some preliminary works along this line appeared . in  @xcite , vu  _ et  al . _ considered the throughput scaling law for a single - hop cognitive radio network , where a linear scaling law is obtained for the sr network with an outage constraint for the pr network . in  @xcite ,",
    "jeon  _ et  al_. considered a multi - hop cognitive network on top of a pr network and assumed that the sr nodes know the location of each pr node . with an elegant transmission scheme",
    ", they showed that by defining a preservation region around each pr node , both networks can achieve the same throughput scaling law as a stand - alone wireless network , while the sr network may suffer from a finite outage probability . in  @xcite ,",
    "yin  _ et  al_. assumed that the sr nodes only konw the locations of pr transmitters ( txs ) and proposed a transmission scheme to show that both networks can achieve the same throughput scaling law as a stand - alone wireless network , with zero outage .    in this paper",
    ", we study the coexistence of two ad hoc networks with different transmission scales ( power and/or transmission range ) based on the transmission capacity defined in  @xcite .",
    "we extend the definition of transmission capacity from a single network to two overlaid networks .",
    "different from the approaches in  @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite , we resort to stochastic geometry tools to quantify the transmission capacities for both the pr and sr networks without defining any preservation regions . by considering the mutual interferences from the two networks",
    ", we discuss the tradeoff of the transmission capacities between them .",
    "the results show that if we permit a slight increase over the outage probability of the pr network , the sum transmission capacity ( i.e. , the overall spectrum efficiency per unit area ) of the overlaid networks will be boosted significantly over that of a single network .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the network model and symbol notations are described in section ii .",
    "the transmission capacity for a single network case is analyzed in section iii .",
    "the transmission capacities for the pr and sr networks and their tradeoff are discussed in section iv .",
    "the numerical results and observations are given in section v. finally , section vi summarizes our conclusions .",
    "consider the scenario where a network of pr nodes and a network of sr nodes coexist in the same geographic region , and assume that the pr network is the legacy network , which has a higher priority to access the spectrum .",
    "the prerequisite condition for introducing a new sr network into the territory of the pr network is that the outage probability increment of the pr network is upper - limited by a target constraint @xmath4 , where @xmath4 usually takes a very small value .",
    "we assume that at a certain time instance the distribution of pr txs follows a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath5 of density @xmath6 , and the distribution of sr txs follows another independent homogeneous ppp @xmath7 of density @xmath8 .",
    "our goal is to evaluate the outage probability of the pr network , @xmath9 , and that of the sr network , @xmath10 , which are functions of the tx node densities @xmath6 and @xmath8 . the specific definitions of outage probability will be given in section iii and section iv .",
    "similar to that in  @xcite , in order to evaluate the outage probabilities , we condition on a typical pr ( or sr ) rx at the origin , which yields the palm distribution for pr ( or sr ) txs .",
    "following the slivnyak s theory in stochastic geometry  @xcite , these conditional distributions also follow homogeneous ppps with the corresponding densities ( i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ) .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the locations of the pr txs and the sr txs , respectively , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the distances from pr tx @xmath17 and sr tx @xmath18 to the origin , respectively .",
    "an attempted transmission is successful if the received signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) at the reference rx is above a threshold , @xmath19 ; otherwise , the transmission fails , i.e. , an outage occurs .",
    "we use @xmath20 and @xmath21 to represent the sinr thresholds for the pr network and the sr network , respectively .    for simplicity ,",
    "we limit our discussion to single - hop transmissions , and assume that all pr txs use the same transmission power @xmath22 , and all pr transmissions are over the same distance @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , all sr txs use the same transmission power @xmath24 over the same transmission distance @xmath25 . for the wireless channel , we only consider the large - scale path - loss , and ignore the effects of shadowing and small - scale multipath fading . as such ,",
    "the normalized channel power gain @xmath26 is given as@xmath27 where @xmath28 is a system - dependent constant , @xmath29 is the distance between the tx and the corresponding rx , and @xmath30 denotes the path - loss exponent . in the following discussion , we normalize @xmath28 to be unity for simplicity .",
    "the ambient noise is assumed to be additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with an average power @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that all the pr txs and the sr txs use the same spectrum with bandwidth normalized to be unity .    as in  @xcite",
    ", we define transmission capacity as follows .",
    "_ transmission capacity _ @xmath32 of a randomly - deployed wireless network is defined as the product among the maximum density @xmath33 of transmissions , the common transmission data rate @xmath34 , and @xmath35 with @xmath36 an asymptotically small outage probability .",
    "therefore , we have@xmath37 as noted in _ _",
    "_ _ @xcite , @xmath32 also represents the unit - area spectral efficiency of the successful transmissions .",
    "in this section , we derive the asymptotic result ( asymptotic over vanishingly - small outage probability values ) for the transmission capacity of the pr network when the sr network is absent . as an example",
    ", we focus on the case when the path - loss exponent @xmath38 , over which we build an asymptotic analysis framework that is useful for the future study over the cases of general @xmath39 values .    when the sr network is absent , denote the target outage probability of the pr network over per - link sinr as @xmath40",
    ". then we have @xmath41 rewrite ( [ eq : p_outage ] ) as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 the moment generating function ( mgf ) of @xmath45 is given by  @xcite @xmath46.\\ ] ] when @xmath38 , we have @xmath47.\\ ] ] via the inverse laplace transform , we obtain the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath45 as @xmath48 and the corresponding cumulative density function ( cdf ) of @xmath45 as @xmath49 from ( [ eq : cdf_p ] ) , we have @xmath50 combined ( [ eq : pout_s1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pr_s_outage ] ) , it is clear that the following condition has to be satisfied : @xmath51 when @xmath52 such that @xmath53 , with taylor series expansion , we obtain the maximum allowable value ( via the monotonicity of the q function ) of @xmath6 asymptotically for @xmath38 as @xmath54 as we can see from ( [ eq : prs_l0 ] ) that when the outage probability @xmath55 is very small , the density of txs is a linear function of @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the transmission capacity of the pr network is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the data rate when the transmission between the tx and its associated rx is successful , which is set to be same for all the links .",
    "when the sr network is present , it introduces interference to the pr network and the outage probability of the pr network will be increased .",
    "if we set the target outage probability increment of the pr network as @xmath4 , we have @xmath58 with @xmath59 , ( [ eq : bi_pr ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath60 the mgf of @xmath61 is given by@xmath62.\\ ] ] define @xmath63 such that the mgf of @xmath64 is given by @xmath65.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath38 , we have @xmath66,\\ ] ] and the pdf of @xmath64 is given by @xmath67 .",

    "the first setup is that we change the value of @xmath73 only , and fix other parameters ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath31 , and @xmath40 ) .",
