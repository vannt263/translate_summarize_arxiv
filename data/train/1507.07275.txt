    "the corresponding direct exchange will be weekly antiferromagnetic @xcite .",

    "[ fig : path]-(a ) , which is expected to be ferromagnetic . due to the large distance ( 4.05  ) between the two cr ions , which reduces direct antiferromagnetic exchange ,",
    "the fm superexchange will dominate the total exchange interaction .",
    "the underlying mechanism of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is more subtle .",
    "the cations are separated by two anions in the possible superexchange path , forming an extended cation - anion - anion - cation interaction path .",
    "goodenough argued @xcite that the rules for an extended cation - anion - anion - cation path are the same as those for cation - anion - cation interactions .",
    "the extended cation - anion - anion - cation interaction can thus be seen as the sum of exchange interactions from two cation - anion - anion `` superexchange path '' .",
    "in addition , according to the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rule @xcite which has been used widely to understand the signs and strengths of superexchange interactions , a 180@xmath2 superexchange is antiferromagnetic while a 90@xmath2 superexchange interaction is ferromagnetic . for an intermediate angle between 90@xmath2 and 180@xmath2 ,",
    "fm and afm will compete with each other and a crossover angle from fm to afm superexchange should exist .",
    "_ @xcite have investigated the fm - afm transformation by controlling the cation - anion - cation angle in cuprate perovskite and find a crossover angle about 127@xmath240.6@xmath2 .",
    "thus , we can reasonably assume that a large cation - anion - anion angle ( @xmath25130@xmath2 ) contributes a afm interaction while an angle near 90@xmath2 presents a fm contribution .",
    "as suggested by sivadas _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , there are many possible exchange paths for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "since the shortest distance between the x@xmath26 pairs in different layers is larger than that between in - plane pairs , the most possible exchange path for @xmath22 and @xmath23 should involve two x anions on the same plane .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : path]-(c ) , both cation - anion - anion angle for @xmath23 is 132.7@xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath23 should be afm due to both afm contributions from the two cation - anion - anion superexchanges . however , for the nnn exchange interaction in fig .",
    "[ fig : path]-(b ) , the two cation - anion - anion angles are 139.8@xmath2 and 97.0@xmath2 , which contributes afm and fm superexchange interactions , respectively .",
    "the sign of @xmath22 will depend on the competition of the fm and afm superexchange interactions . in crx@xmath0",
    ", fm dominates over afm and the resulting extended superexchange is fm .",
    "in contrast , for other systems such as mnps@xmath0 ( se@xmath0 ) and crsi(ge)te@xmath0 , the total nnn exchange interaction with the extended superexchange path is afm.@xcite    ( color online ) the strain dependence of exchange interactions and curie temperature of single - layer chromium trihalides.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    furthermore , we also investigate the magnetic interactions and curie temperature of crx@xmath0 under a biaxial strain .",
    "results obtained based on interactions up to nearest - neighbours or third - nearest neighbours are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain ] .",
    "we find that the nn and nnn exchange interactions and the corresponding curie temperature increase with strain , whereas the magnitude of 3nn interaction decrease .",
    "yoshida _ _ et al.__@xcite have investigated experimentally the pressure effect on the curie temperature of crbr@xmath0 and found that t@xmath27 decreases linearly with pressure , which agrees with our calculations .",
    "the curie temperature can be tuned gradually with strain and 130 k can be reached in the case of cri@xmath0 using a 10% strain .",
    "similar results are also reported in other systems such as crsite@xmath0.@xcite in addition , we also find that a compressive strain can also induce a fm to afm transition . the af - nel phase becomes the most stable phase at a strain of 6% , 4% , 6% , 8% for crf@xmath0 , crcl@xmath0 , crbr@xmath0 and cri@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "such a large compressive strain required to destroy the ferromagnetic state implies the robustness of the intrinsic ferromagnetism in single - layer crx@xmath0 .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the geometry , electronic , optical and magnetic properties of chromium trihalides in single - layer and bulk forms .",
    "our results indicate that the optb88-vdw functional can capture the interlayer vdw interaction of bulk crx@xmath0 quite well while hse06 gives consistent electronic structures and optical properties with available experiment .",
    "single - layer chromium trihalides are found to have very low cleavage energies and high in - plane stiffness , which suggests that free - standing single - layer chromium trihalides can be easily exfoliated from the bulk crystals .",
    "the stability of single - layer chromium trihalides is further confirmed using the phonon dispersions calculation and _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "furthermore , our results also suggest that these 2d crystals exhibit robust long - range ferromagnetic order with magnetic moments of 3@xmath1 per formula unit and large magnetic anisotropy energies .",
    "the ferromagnetic nearest - neighbour exchange interactions can be attributed to the competition between direct antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and near 90@xmath2 ferromagnetic superexchange interactions .",
    "the next - nearest - neighbour fm exchange interactions can be understood by the angle - dependent extended superexchange cr - x - x - cr interaction .",
    "monte carlo simulations based on the classical heisenberg model predicts curie temperatures of chromium trihalides up to 90 k , and can be further increased by applying biaxial tensile strains .",
    "electronic structure calculations indicate that both bulk and 2d chromium trihalides are half semiconductors with indirect band gaps and the absorption edges of crbr@xmath0 and cri@xmath0 lie in the visible range , which suggests that they are promising candidates for future low - dimensional semiconductor spintronic , magneto - electronic and magneto - optic applications .    the financial supports from the national natural science foundation of china ( grant no .",
