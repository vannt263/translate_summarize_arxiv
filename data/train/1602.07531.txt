    ", convex set @xmath0 in @xmath4 ( i.e. , a convex body ) is said to be of _ constant width _ if the distance of any two parallel supporting hyperplanes of @xmath0 is the same . on the other hand ,",
    "such a convex body @xmath0 is called ( diametrically ) _ complete _ if any proper superset of it has larger diameter than @xmath0 .",
    "it is obvious that these definitions can also be used in any ( normed or ) minkowski space , using the corresponding distance measures . in euclidean spaces of any dimension as well as in arbitrary normed planes constant width and completeness",
    "are equivalent .",
    "this is no longer the case in @xmath5-dimensional minkowski spaces if @xmath6 , yielding the notion of perfect norms ( used for norms in which this equivalence still holds ) . surveys and basic references on bodies of constant width and complete bodies in euclidean @xmath5-space are @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and results on their analogues in minkowski spaces are collected or proved in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a relatively new and closely related notion is that of reduced bodies : a convex body @xmath0 in @xmath4 is said to be _ reduced _ if any convex proper subset of it has smaller ( minimal ) width .",
    "this notion creates already in euclidean @xmath5-space sufficiently interesting open research problems ( see the survey @xcite ) .",
    "for example , it is unknown whether there exist reduced polytopes in euclidean @xmath5-space if @xmath6 (  @xcite and @xcite ) . as first shown in @xcite , the notion of reducedness can be carried over to minkowski spaces , too ; existing results and interesting research problems are presented in @xcite . since , in general ,",
    "in such spaces complete bodies need not be reduced ( see @xcite ) and one can construct reduced bodies which are not complete , the question is how these two classes are related to each other .",
    "indeed , the family of bodies of constant width forms a subfamily of both . in this article , for the first time the question is posed whether for non - perfect norms the family of bodies of constant width forms the intersection of the two other families ! moreover , this question is investigated even for _ generalized minkowski spaces _ , in which the unit balls ( called gauge bodies ) are still convex bodies having the origin as interior point , but need not be centrally symmmetric .",
    "so our paper contains also various new notions which are interesting for themselves and necessary for switching from normed spaces to generalized minkowski spaces .",
    "to do so , we use the so called minkowski asymmetry several times .",
    "there exists a rich variety of asymmetry measures for convex sets ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) for the possibly most comprehensive overview ) , but amongst all , the one receiving most attention is the minkowski asymmetry . in @xcite",
    "it is shown how it naturally relates to complete and constant width sets in minkowski spaces .",
    "moreover , it has been repeatedly used to sharpen and strengthen geometric inequalities and related results ,  @xcite .",
    "we prove the following results for generalized minkowski spaces : if the convex body @xmath0 is a complete and reduced simplex , then it is of constant width .",
    "and the same implication holds for the large family of all convex bodies possessing a smooth extreme point ( obviously , this class contains all strictly convex and all smooth convex bodies ) . extending the notion of perfect norm to generalized minkowski spaces , we also obtain some results on perfect gauge bodies , including a characterization of them via completions of the convex bodies under consideration .",

    "note that in the following we do not really assume @xmath24 to be an interior point of @xmath1 , as we do not use the gauge function ; our considerations are , more generally , based on translation - invariant radius functions .    denoting the hausdorff distance by @xmath31",

    "indeed , if @xmath217 is a @xmath24-symmetric polytope possessing a pair of facets @xmath219 intersecting only in a vertex of @xmath1 , then each of the facets contains two different edges intersecting in the vertex .",
    "however , since the facets only intersect in the vertex , the four edges are different , thus implying that @xmath1 is not simple .",
    "conversely , since in 3-space there is a rotational order of the facets around any vertex , the assumption that @xmath1 is non - simple implies the existence of two different facets intersecting only in a vertex .    in dimensions",
    "at least @xmath252 , the assumption that every pair of non - disjoint facets intersecting in at least an edge does not imply that @xmath1 is simple .",
    "observe that the other way around still holds true : every two non - disjoint facets of a simple polytope intersect in an @xmath222-dimensional face of @xmath123 .",
    "for the converse take , as an example , a double pyramid @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is an @xmath255-dimensional minkowski - centered simplex and @xmath256 .",
    "on the one hand , @xmath123 is non - simple , as every vertex in @xmath257 is contained in @xmath258 edges of @xmath123 . on the other hand ,",
    "every facet of @xmath123 contains exactly @xmath5 vertices , while @xmath123 has @xmath259 vertices in total .",
    "thus every two different facets have at least @xmath248 vertices in common . hence , if @xmath260 , any two ( intersecting ) facets of @xmath123 intersect at least in an edge .      because of lemma [",
    "l : gauge ] , it is enough to verify the corollary in case of @xmath263 , and we may assume that , without loss of generality , @xmath150 is minkowski - centered . let @xmath264 , and @xmath265\\setminus\\{i\\}\\})$ ] be the facet of @xmath150 not containing @xmath117 .",
    "let us consider the two facets @xmath266 and @xmath267 of @xmath155 , which have the same outer normals as @xmath227 and @xmath268 , respectively , and @xmath269 as a common vertex . from corollary [ cor : asymcont ]",
    "we obtain @xmath270 indeed , since @xmath271 , we have @xmath272 .",
    "thus @xmath273 and , analogously , @xmath274 hence @xmath275 , which finishes the proof because of lemma [",
    "l : exteggleston ] .      because of proposition [ prop : tcomplete ] we know that in case of @xmath278 we have that @xmath150 is complete but not of constant width with respect to @xmath1 , showing the non - perfectness of @xmath1 .",
    "however , in case that @xmath279 , corollary [ cor : s - snonperfect ] implies that @xmath1 is non - perfect either .              now let us assume that ( i ) is false .",
    "then we will prove that ( ii ) is false as well . assuming that ( i ) is false , there exists a complete body @xmath283 which is not of constant width .",
    "the idea of the proof is to construct a subset @xmath0 of @xmath283 such that @xmath283 is a completion of @xmath0 and the width @xmath73 and the width @xmath284 are not achieved in the same direction .",
    "this then implies @xmath285 , thus leading to the desired contradiction .",
    "now we obtain from proposition [ prop : opt_hom ] that there exist points @xmath287 and outer normals @xmath122 of hyperplanes supporting @xmath283 and @xmath288 at @xmath117 , @xmath289 $ ] , with @xmath290 .",
    "moreover , we may scale the vectors @xmath122 such that @xmath291 .",
    "now , defining @xmath292 , we see that all the segments @xmath293 $ ] are diametrical chords of @xmath283 .",
    "hence it must hold that @xmath294 for all @xmath289 $ ] and , defining @xmath295 , also that @xmath296 .    since @xmath297 , @xmath298",
    ", we may assume that @xmath299 .",
    "now consider the set @xmath300 , which still contains @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "the half - space @xmath303 supports the inball @xmath304 and therefore contains extreme points of it .",
    "now , by continuity of @xmath305 , @xmath306 , for any @xmath41 sufficiently close to @xmath307 holds @xmath308 .",
    "however , since the set of exposed points is dense within the set of extreme points of any convex body , we may carefully choose @xmath41 such that the following are true :      due to these conditions , there exists @xmath225 small enough such that @xmath312_2}$ ] still satisfies @xmath313 .",
    "now , because @xmath314,c)=d(u , c)$ ] , we see that @xmath283 is a completion of @xmath0 . moreover , since each of the half - spaces @xmath315_2}$ ] touches @xmath316 in a unique exposed point and @xmath317 , @xmath318 for all directions @xmath319 .",
    "thus the width of @xmath0 is uniquely attained in direction of @xmath41 , and because @xmath320 , we can conclude that @xmath285 .        because of lemma [",
    "l : gauge ] , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath1 is centrally symmetric .",
    "first we show the case in which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are polygons .",
    "let @xmath45 be a point in the relative interior of the edge @xmath323 of @xmath0 induced by @xmath116 .",
    "then @xmath324 ( which follows from the uniqueness of the outer normal , up to positive multiples , at that point and the completeness of @xmath0 ) means that the edges of @xmath142 parallel to edges of @xmath323 are contained in the boundary of @xmath191 . since for @xmath325",
    "all edges of @xmath142 are parallel to edges of @xmath123 it follows that @xmath326 .",
    "now , let @xmath0 be an arbitrary , planar convex set , @xmath41 a unit vector such that @xmath327 , and @xmath328 , @xmath329 $ ] , such that @xmath330 , @xmath331 , @xmath329 $ ] , are the parallel supporting hyperplanes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the direction of @xmath41 .",
    "we then consider a sequence @xmath332 of polygons with @xmath333 and @xmath334 ( @xmath335 ) .",
    "then @xmath336 and therefore @xmath337 for all @xmath338 .",
    "now we let @xmath339 be a completion of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath332 .",
    "we now prove by contradiction that @xmath340 ( @xmath335 ) .",
    "if not , let us observe that since @xmath341 is a completion of @xmath0 , then @xmath342 , for some @xmath45 . hence @xmath343 is absolutely bounded . using the blaschke selection theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.8.7 ) , there exists a subsequence of @xmath341 ( for which , , we may assume that it is the sequence itself ) such that @xmath344 ( @xmath335 ) .",
    "then on the one hand the completeness of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 tells us that @xmath345 , and on the other hand the continuity of the diameter implies that @xmath346 .",
    "altogether this shows that @xmath347 a contradiction .",
    "thus @xmath340 ( @xmath335 ) , and hence @xmath348    let us observe that the argument for general @xmath0 and @xmath1 in lemma [ l : polyimplgen ] uses the fact that open question [ op : compltred ] is true for polygons .",
    "indeed , it holds true for every @xmath24-symmetric @xmath96 , with @xmath349 .",
    "this therefore motivates why examples of non - perfect norms are polytopal .",
    "moreover , this approach might be useful as well when considering sets that are complete and reduced simultaneously .",
