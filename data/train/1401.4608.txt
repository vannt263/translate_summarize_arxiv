    "miniaturization is one of the requirements to make electronic devices smaller and smaller . to fulfill this requirement , graphene based electronic devices might provide a breakthrough alternative for the current state - of - the - art semiconductor industry .",
    "graphene is a promising material to build electronic devices because of its unusual properties due to the dirac - like spectrum of the charge carriers .",
    "@xcite in addition , researchers around the world seek to make next generation electronic devices from graphene because the material possesses high charge mobility .",
    "there is an opportunity to control electronic properties of graphene - based structures by several different techniques such as gate controlled electric fields , magnetic fields , and to engineer the electromechanical properties via pseudomorphic gauge fields .",
    "@xcite recently , spin echo phenomena , followed by strong beating patterns due to rapid oscillations of quantum states along a graphene ribbon , have been investigated for realization of quantum memory at optical states in the far - infrared region for quantum information processing .",
    "@xcite    graphene sheets designed to make next generation electronic devices consist of surfaces that are not perfectly flat .",
    "the surfaces exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening , the surface normal varies by several degrees and the out - of - plane deformations reach to the nanometer scale .",
    "@xcite out - of - plane displacements without a preferred direction induce ripples in the graphene sheet ,  @xcite while in - plane displacements induced by applying suitable tensile edge stress along the armchair and zigzag directions lead to the relaxed shape graphene .",
    "@xcite in experiments with graphene suspended on substrate trenches , there appear much longer and taller waves ( close to a micron scale ) directed parallel to the applied stress .",
    "@xcite these long wrinkles are mechanically induced and we know that theoretically it is possible to corrugate an elastic membrane at absolute zero temperature .",
    "the mechanical deformation of a free standing graphene sheet can be understood by applying suitable edge stress along the armchair and zigzag directions .",
    "the tensile forces , that can be applied on the graphene sheet with a compressed elastic string , are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this paper , we show that intrinsic edge stresses can have a significant influence on the morphology of graphene sheets and substantially modify the bandstructures of graphene quantum dots .",
    "we present a model that couples the navier equations , accounting for thermo - electromechanical effects , to the electronic properties of graphene quantum dots .",
    "@xcite here we show that the amplitude of the induced waves due to applied tensile edge stress along the armchair and zigzag directions increases with temperature and provides the level crossing in the localized edge states .",
    "this kind of level crossings is absent for the states formed at the center of the graphene sheet due to the presence of three fold symmetry induced by pseudomorphic strain tensor .",
    "the total thermoelastic energy density associated to the strain for the two - dimensional graphene sheet can be written as  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a tensor of rank four ( the elastic modulus tensor ) , @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) is the strain tensor and @xmath4 are the stress temperature coefficients . also , @xmath5 is the distribution of temperature in the graphene sheet that can be found by solving laplace s equation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the heat induction coefficients of graphene .",
    "thus we write the laplace s equation as @xmath9 we suppose that the graphene sheet at the boundary 4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is connected to the heat bath of temperature @xmath10 and all other three boundaries 1,2,3 are fixed at zero temperature .",
    "thus , the exact solution of laplace s equation can be written as @xmath11 where the constant @xmath12 relates to the temperature of the thermal bath @xmath10 as : @xmath13 here @xmath14 , m is an integer , @xmath15 is the length and @xmath16 is the width of the graphene sheet .",
    "the arbitrary constant @xmath12 can be found by performing fourier s transform of  ( [ tx ] ) : @xmath17 in  ( [ u - s ] ) , the strain tensor components can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are in - plane and out - of - plane displacements , respectively .  @xcite it is believed that the ripples in graphene have two different types of sources ( see figs . 1 and 3 of ref .  ) .",
    "both types of ripple waves are considered to be the sinusoidal function of position whose amplitude lies normal to the plane of two - dimensional graphene sheet .",
    "the origin of first type ripples results in the relaxed shape graphene ( i.e. , the displacement vector relaxed to the equilibrium position where the total elastic energy density is minimized ) due to externally applied in - plane ( along x and y - directions only ) tensile edge stress .",
    "@xcite such kind of ripples that can be seen in the form of relaxed shape graphene occurs in a fashion similar to leaves or torn plastic  @xcite where buckling mechanism displaces only the carbon atoms near the edge of the graphene sheet .",
    "@xcite while the origin of second type ripples results in the height fluctuations through out the graphene sheet due to adsorbed hydroxide molecules sitting on random sites of hexagon graphene molecules in a two - dimensional graphene sheet .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we only consider the ripple waves induced by buckling mechanisms ( @xmath21 ) by applying tensile edge stress along the armchair and zigzag directions .",
    "@xcite hence the strain tensor components for graphene in 2d displacement vector @xmath22 can be written as @xmath23 the stress tensor components @xmath24 for graphene can be written as  @xcite @xmath25 in the continuum limit , elastic deformations of graphene sheets are described by the navier equations @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the coupled navier - type equations of thermoelasticity for graphene can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 now we apply the compressive tensile edge stresses through the boundaries of the graphene sheet ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) along the lateral directions and seek to establish the relationship between the waves generated due to applied tensile edge stresses and the in - plane displacement vector .",
    "more precisely , the mechanical deformation along the lateral direction of a graphene sheet can be understood by considering the effect of externally applied tensile edge stresses along the lateral direction in the form of compressed elastic string between which the 2-dimensional free standing graphene sheet is clamped .",
    "@xcite it is natural to expect that the longitudinal waves , generated by compressed elastic forces , travel along the direction of applied tensile edge stresses .",
    "hence we might think the sinusoidal function in the deformation of in - plane displacement vectors that correlate the geometric features of the longitudinal waves generated in the graphene sheet due to compressed elastic tensile edge stresses which finally turn the flat surface of the graphene sheet into the relaxed shape graphene in the form of torn plastic .",
    "thus we assume the functional form of @xmath29 at the boundary @xmath30 of armchair as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the amplitude and @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the wavelength while the total edge energy per unit length becomes  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the edge stress and the elastic modulus of the edge along the armchair direction of the graphene sheet .",

    "the variation in the amplitude of ripple waves , expressed in nanometer , is shown in the color bar ( see eq .",

    "( [ a ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we investigate the influence of temperature on the strain tensor under an applied tensile edge stress along the armchair direction .",
    "again , the oscillations in the strain tensor occur due to the applied tensile stress along the armchair direction that induces longitudinal waves and propagate along the armchair direction .",
    "we note that the increasing temperature from @xmath109 ( upper panel ) to room temperature ( lower panel ) enhances the amplitude of the waves that eventually increase the magnetic field of the pseudomorphic vector potentials and allow us to investigate its influence in the bandstructure calculation of graphene at dirac points ( for details , see figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we investigate the total elastic energy density vs temperature .",
    "even though the optimum values of the amplitudes of waves along the armchair and zigzag directions are exactly the same , the variation in the total free elastic energy density is enhanced for the case of applied tensile edge stress along the zigzag direction ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "this occurs because the graphene sheet along the boundary 4 is connected to the heat reservoir that enhances the free elastic energy of the waves traveling along the zigzag direction .",
    "another important result of the paper is the study of the influence of thermomechanics on the bandstructure of bilayer graphene qds via pseudomorphic vector potentials . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we have plotted several states wavefunctions of the graphene qds . it can be seen that in addition to the localized states formed at the center of the graphene sheet , edge states are also present at the zigzag boundary .",
    "the localized edge states at the zigzag boundary can be seen due to the fact that the pseudomorphic vector potential originating from the thermo - electromechanical effects generates a large magnetic field applied perpendicular to the two - dimensional graphene sheet .",
    "for example , considering @xmath110 , we find @xmath111 , where @xmath112 .",
    "further , by assuming sinusoidal functions of strain tensor ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) generated by applying tensile edge stress along the armchair direction , for example : @xmath113 and @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the amplitude of the strain tensor , we find @xmath116 , where @xmath117 . by considering @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( upper panel ) ) , we estimate @xmath120 .",
    "hence such a large magnetic field along z - direction originating from electromechanical effects induces a persistent current that flows toward the edge of the graphene . as a result , a positive ( negative ) dispersion in the electron ( hole ) like states is induced at the zigzag edge ( also see fig.4 of ref .  ) and the localized electron - hole states wavefunction drift towards and over the edge of graphene sheet .",
    "@xcite hence the wavefunctions that are pressed against the edge finally turn into the localized edge current carrying states .",
    "@xcite similar kind of localized edge states are also shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) of ref .  .",
    "furthermore , by utilizing tight binding and continuum model , the authors in ref .   have shown that the tunneling effect at the interface between the internal and external regions of the dots can be avoided and consequently the charge carriers are confined at the zigzag edge ( for example see eq .  ( 11 ) and left panel of fig .",
    "6 of ref .  ) .",
    "such localized edge states , shown in the lower panel of fig .  [ fig5 ] in this paper , are highly sensitive to the applied tensile edge stress along the armchair and zigzag directions .",
    "we observe three fold symmetry in the first excited state wavefunction ( see inset plot of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) of graphene that is in agreement to the experimentally reported results ( see fig.(4 ) of ref .  ) and as well as previously reported theoretical results ( see ref .  ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we find the level crossing at @xmath121 due to the fact that the edge energy difference between the ground and first excited states decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "this level crossing point extends to higher temperatures with decreasing values of tensile edge stress ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we have analyzed why the level crossing point can be seen on the edge states , but can not be seen on the localized states formed at the center of the graphene sheet .",
    "the reason is that the graphene sheet on boundary 4 is connected to the heat reservoir .",
    "hence , the energy difference between the ground and first excited states decreases with increasing temperature . as a result",
    ", we find the level crossing in the edge states to be at the zigzag boundary with the accessible values of temperatures .",
    "the energy difference between the ground and first excited states formed at the center of the graphene sheet also decreases with increasing temperature ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "however , such energy states do not meet each other with any practically applicable values of the temperature due to absence of two fold symmetry in graphene .",
    "in fact , the induced pseudomorphic fields by the strain tensor affect the graphene charge carriers and produce a three fold symmetry in the wavefunction of two - dimensional graphene sheet ( see inset plot of  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the symmetry of the pseudomorphic fields is determined by the corresponding symmetry of the strain field .",
    "for example , a uniform pseudomorphic field requires a special strain field distorted with three fold symmetry .",
    "to conclude , we have developed a model which allows us to investigate the influence of temperature on the relaxed shape of the graphene sheet as well as in the qds that are formed in the two - dimensional graphene sheet with the application of gate potentials .",
    "we have shown that the variation in the total free elastic energy density is enhanced with temperature for the case of applied tensile edge stress along the zigzag direction .",
    "we have treated the strain , induced by an applied tensile edge stress along the armchair and zigzag directions , as a pseudomorphic vector potential and shown that the level crossing point between the ground and first excited edge states at the zigzag boundary extends to higher temperatures with decreasing values of the tensile edge stress .",
    "such kind of level crossing is absent in the states formed at the center of the graphene sheet due to the presence of three fold symmetry .",
