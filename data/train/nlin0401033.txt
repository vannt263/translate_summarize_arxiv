    "the interaction of oscillatory systems arise naturally in many areas of science and has intrigued investigators for a long time .",
    "the earlier studies go back to the 17th century when the dutch scientist christiaan huygens observed that two clocks mounted on a common basis tend to synchronize regardless of the initial conditions @xcite . in the last several decades",
    ", models based on coupled oscillators have found diverse applications in physics and biology . among many examples",
    "are arrays of josephson junctions @xcite , semiconductor lasers @xcite , relativistic magnetrons @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , circadian pacemakers @xcite , intestinal electrical rhythms @xcite , and a variety of biological processes @xcite .",
    "the investigation of these systems has provided striking examples of different types of dynamical behavior that can be induced by the presence of coupling .",
    "synchronization is probably the most widely studied among these @xcite .",
    "another interesting dynamics is the so - called amplitude ( or oscillator ) death , whereby individual oscillators cease to oscillate when coupled and go to an equilibrium solution instead .",
    "one of the first accounts of this phenomenon was given in the 19th century by lord rayleigh , who noted that when two organ pipes stand side by side they `` ...  may almost reduce one another to silence '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vol .  2 , chapter xvi ) .",
    "later , amplitude death was observed in electronic systems @xcite and chemical oscillators @xcite , causing renewed interest in this area .",
    "a theoretical analysis was given in @xcite , which considered a pair of linearly coupled oscillators each of which is near a hopf bifurcation .",
    "in particular , it was established that a fairly general class of such systems can exhibit amplitude death in case the individual oscillator frequencies are sufficiently different and the coupling is diffusive . in a similar vein , it was shown that a network of limit cycle oscillators can experience amplitude death if there is a distribution in frequencies @xcite .",
    "a series of more recent studies have demonstrated that time delays in the coupling can induce amplitude death even in the case of identical frequencies @xcite . in these works ,",
    "a pair of identical stuart - landau equations are considered under scalar and diffusive coupling . a linear stability analysis and numerical simulations",
    "are used to show that the presence of delay can stabilize the equilibrium solution in this case .",
    "a similar conclusion is drawn for an all - to - all coupled network of identical stuart - landau systems , where the coupling strengths and time delays between pairs are also identical . from a different perspective",
    ", other studies have shown the role of feedback delays in suppressing or modifying oscillations in a single oscillator @xcite .",
    "time delays are thus significant in the oscillations and stability of many systems , which justifies the efforts devoted to their analysis .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to obtain rigorous conditions for amplitude death when weakly nonlinear planar systems ( such as those near a hopf bifurcation ) are diffusively coupled and the coupling involves time delays .",
    "we consider arbitrary nonlinearities and network structure to prove the generality of amplitude death for the interconnection of such systems .",
    "furthermore , we show the existence of parameter ranges for which only parts of the network are quenched while the others continue to oscillate , even though they remain connected .",
    "this phenomenon , which may be termed partial amplitude death , is shown to be possible in case when the individual units are sufficiently different .",
    "this study extends the previous results in several directions .",
    "firstly , we treat a general class of systems and derive conditions for delay - induced amplitude death irrespective of the particular nonlinearities that may be present . in the absence of delays ,",
    "general conclusions can be drawn by considering normal forms that represent the dynamics on a center manifold when each oscillator is near a hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis is more difficult when delays are introduced , and as a result , the study of amplitude death in the delayed case so far has been confined to some special equations .",
    "for instance , the system studied in @xcite is obtained by adding delays to the center manifold equations considered in @xcite , and as such it does not represent general center manifold dynamics for delay - coupled oscillators . hence , an interesting question is what conclusions can be drawn in the presence of delays when nonlinearities other than the stuart - landau system are considered .    secondly , we consider very general coupling conditions .",
    "we do not restrict to scalar coupling and present results for arbitrary diffusion matrices between oscillators .",
    "both the diffusion matrices and the delays are allowed to vary from pair to pair within the network .",
    "in addition , there are no assumptions on either the size or the topology of the network , and the results apply to any network layout , including all - to - all , nearest - neighbor , and sparse coupling types .",
    "finally , instead of a local stability analysis we obtain global results using averaging theory . among other things ,",
    "this allows the results to be applicable to more general systems such as bistable oscillators , where the origin is stable but there are also limit cycle solutions which may be annihilated by the effect of coupling .",
    "in fact , in such cases the local stability analysis of the origin can not yield parameter ranges for amplitude death since the origin always remains stable . on the other hand ,",
    "the averaging approach enables one to study the ( averaged ) trajectories inside a large sphere and derive conditions that ensure that they all decay to zero .",
    "furthermore , this non - local view is essential for investigating the phenomenon partial amplitude death , since here also , the stability type of the origin for the overall system remains unchanged as parts of the network collapse to approach the zero solution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section a pair of coupled oscillators",
    "is considered . after a brief discussion of averaging theory for delay - differential equations ,",
    "the averaged equations are obtained , which indicate that qualitatively there are two cases to consider .",
    "section [ sec : similar ] treats the first case where the frequencies of individual oscillators are close to each other . here",
    ", sufficient conditions are derived for the occurrence of amplitude death , and the possibility of death for identical oscillators for almost all positive values of the delay is proved .",
    "the case of large frequency differences is addressed in section [ sec : dissimilar ] , where it is shown that it is possible for only one of the oscillators to be suppressed while the other one continues to oscillate .",
    "section [ sec : network ] extends the results to an arbitrary size network with varying coupling coefficients and delays between the oscillators .",
    "a general condition is derived under which the network experiences amplitude death as a whole or only in parts .",

    "the results of the previous sections suggest that each set can undergo amplitude death independently of the others .",
    "this observation is made precise by the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : net ] suppose @xmath28 and @xmath186and let @xmath86 , @xmath244 , be defined by ( [ q ] )",
    ". let @xmath248 denote the vector formed by the concatenation of @xmath192 for @xmath244 .",

    "if@xmath252 then the zero solution of ( [ net - avg ] ) is unstable .",
    "taking the inner product of the @xmath188-th equation in ( [ net - avg ] ) with @xmath192 and adding over @xmath244 gives@xmath253 let @xmath84 . by ( [ kbar ] ) and ( [ q ] ) , @xmath254 provided",

    "suppose that the network consists of @xmath219 oscillators with identical ( or @xmath75 close ) frequencies , and consider the condition ( [ stab - net ] ) for amplitude death .",
    "when an additional oscillator with a different frequency is connected , the first sum in ( [ stab - net ] ) changes by @xmath274 while the other terms remain the same .",
    "thus if @xmath274 is sufficiently large for @xmath275 , then the original set of @xmath219 oscillators will experience amplitude death after the new connection .",
    "conversely , if @xmath274 is negative for some @xmath188 , then it is possible for the new connection to `` awaken '' the network from a previous death state , by satisfying the instability condition ( [ instab - net ] ) .",
    "when the newly added oscillator has the same frequency as the rest , the coupling delay becomes important .",
    "for simplicity let us assume that all oscillators and the coupling conditions between them are identical , so the indices can be dropped .",
    "the death condition ( [ stab - net ] ) then has the form @xmath276 assuming @xmath277 , this condition can not be satisfied for any @xmath219 if either @xmath278 or @xmath279 .",
    "however , if @xmath280 and @xmath1 is symmetric with positive trace , the network will undergo amplitude death for all sufficiently large network sizes @xmath219 . for nonsymmetric matrices",
    "the same conclusion holds whenever the left hand side of ( [ large ] ) is positive , i.e. , if @xmath3 is sufficiently larger than @xmath281 .",
    "however , for highly nonsymmetric matrices the presence of the connection delay may make amplitude death impossible , as the left hand side of ( [ large ] ) becomes negative .",
    "although physically meaningful in most models , the assumption that there are no self - connections in the network ( [ network ] ) is not an essential requirement for theorem [ thm : net ] .",
    "in fact , an investigation of the first part of the proof shows that ( [ stab - net ] ) remains a sufficient condition for amplitude death even when the matrices @xmath226 are not zero .",
    "this observation points to an interesting connection between the present paper and previous works on feedback control of oscillations . for if one considers the system@xmath282 as a special case of the network ( [ network ] ) consisting of a single oscillator , theorem [ thm : net ] gives the sufficient condition@xmath283 for its stability .",
    "since the latter inequality can be satisfied if @xmath3 is large and @xmath133 , one concludes that for almost all positive values of the delay @xmath29 and sufficiently small @xmath284 , the oscillator given by the left hand side of ( [ qq71 ] ) can be stabilized by a linear delayed feedback of the form @xmath285 , regardless of a precise knowledge about the nonlinearity @xmath8 .",
    "this is in agreement with related results which were obtained for similar systems in the context of delayed - feedback control of oscillatory behavior @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the network may be divided into clusters which separately experience amplitude death entails the formation of spatial patterns consisting of oscillating and suppressed units .",
    "such pattern formation is best studied under more specific assumptions on the network structure ; therefore , it is not treated further in this paper .",
    "we have presented a mathematical analysis of the phenomenon of amplitude death for a general class of weakly nonlinear systems which are diffusively coupled with time delays .",
    "sufficient conditions are derived for the coupled network to exhibit amplitude death .",
    "it is shown that when the individual oscillators are sufficiently different , it is possible for only parts of the network to be suppressed , while the rest continues to oscillate .",
    "the size of the network may enhance or inhibit amplitude death depending on the nature of the coupling matrices , where both the magnitude and the sign of the trace of the matrix plays an important role .",
    "the quantitative conditions presented are rigorously justified for weakly nonlinear oscillators . in particular , they are significant when considering networks where each individual unit is near a hopf bifurcation . on the other hand , numerical simulations suggest that in many cases the qualitative aspects of the results remain valid for stronger nonlinearities as well . in view of the few assumptions required on the network structure and the individual units ,",
    "the generality of the results imply that the death of the network , either in part or as a whole , may be among the common and robust dynamical behaviors in many practical systems",
