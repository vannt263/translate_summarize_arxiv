    "integrated spectroscopy of galaxies has been performed primarily in the optical because much of the ( blue ) optical light comes from the well - understood main sequence turnoff stars .",
    "as one pushes into the near infrared ( nir ) , the integrated light of a stellar population is dominated by very luminous stars in later stages of stellar evolution , such as thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars . beginning with @xcite and continuing with , e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "it has become clear that the unique features and high luminosity of tp - agb stars profoundly affect the nir integrated light of stellar populations .",
    "specifically , for stellar populations with ages @xmath0100  myr to @xmath01  gyr , the tp - agb can contribute up to @xmath060% of the k - band flux ( depending on metallicity , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "strong molecular features , from cn , co , c@xmath2 , and h@xmath2o , in tp - agb stellar atmospheres should appear in the integrated nir spectrum of populations in this age range .",
    "unfortunately , relatively poorly understood processes such as mass loss , convective transport of heavy elements to the surface , and thermal pulsation influence the late stages of stellar evolution and thus predictions for the integrated spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of c - rich to o - rich agb stars in a population is known to depend strongly on metallicity , meaning that the contribution from tp - agb stars can vary drastically not only with age but also composition @xcite . however , observational work has constrained these effects on the integrated light of stellar populations with observations of magellanic cloud and galactic clusters , and the predictive potential of nir spectroscopic features has been demonstrated ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in short , tp - agb features should be traceable in galaxies",
    "whose nir light is dominated by stars in the @xmath0100  myr to @xmath01  gyr age range .",
    "for example , @xcite have detected the presence of tp - agb stars in the nir spectrum of a young star cluster in the galaxy ngc 7252 , and have verified that the predicted features expected in a young population ( @xmath0300  myr ) are present in the nir spectrum .",
    "this successful detection of tp - agb features in ngc  7252 thus motivates additional nir spectroscopy of bright , nearby galaxies with young populations to further test the use of nir spectral indicators as chronometers .",
    "we also note that while light from the tp - agb can dominate the nir flux , the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) also contributes an appreciable amount to the integrated light , and hydrogen features ( specifically the paschen series ) due to msto stars will be visible . to investigate the behavior of the tp - agb and msto features as a function of both age and metallicity we consulted the (",
    "* hereafter m05 ) stellar population synthesis models , which include a careful treatment of the tp - agb . in this letter",
    "we use nir spectra of two galaxies with very different star formation histories to test if population synthesis models of tp - agb and msto features can differentiate between young and intermediate - age populations .",
    "because its high nuclear surface brightness and proximity allow for both high snr spectroscopy and resolved stellar photometry of the giant branch , the intermediate age compact elliptical galaxy m32 has been extensively studied .",
    "recent work has included integrated optical spectroscopy of the nucleus and extranuclear region out to the half - light radius @xmath3 @xcite , and nir imaging of the giant branches @xcite .",
    "these studies find that the nuclear light is dominated by an approximately solar metallicity intermediate - age population ( @xmath03  4  gyr ) .",
    "because its stellar content has been constrained by several established age - dating techniques , m32 is ideal for testing other predictive techniques .    likewise , the blue s0 galaxy ngc  5102 is close and bright enough for high snr integrated spectroscopy plus resolved cmd analysis of its brightest stars .",
    "it is classified as a post - starburst ( psb ) galaxy because its strong balmer - line absorption and absence of emission indicates that star formation terminated recently .",
    "studies by , e.g. , @xcite have indicated that the nuclear region of ngc 5102 has undergone a termination of star formation within the past @xmath010100  myr , after a several hundred myr period of activity , guaranteeing that there is an appreciable young population with a mean age of a few 100 myr . the intermediate age stars in m32 and the younger stars in ngc  5102 are a useful pairing because most of the nir light emitted by these two galaxies comes from stars in different evolutionary stages : the younger population will be dominated by the tp - agb and a blue msto , while in the intermediate age population most of the light comes from the red giant branch and an older msto ( see fig .  13 in m05 ) .",
    "in this letter we define four age - sensitive nir spectroscopic indices , two of which measure previously defined tp - agb features , and two that measure paschen series absorption lines , and compare the observed values in m32 and ngc  5102 to predictions of the m05 stellar population models .",
    "we demonstrate that the derived ages from the nir indices agree closely with previously published ages determined from optical spectroscopy , and thus provide evidence to support the reliability of nir spectral signatures as a useful chronometer for galaxy evolution .",
    "on the nights of 12 and 13 may 2010 , we observed ngc  5102 with the spex spectrograph on the nasa infrared telescope facility @xcite . the detector is a 1024@xmath41024 aladdin  3 insb array .",
    "we used the short cross - dispersed ( sxd ) mode , with a 0@xmath58 slit ( spectral @xmath6 ) aligned with the parallactic angle .",
    "we took two abba object / sky sequences for a total of eight on - object exposures of 120  s each .",
    "the sxd mode simultaneously covers @xmath7  @xmath8 m , so avoids issues such as order overlap and variable sky features that plague single - order infrared spectroscopy .",
    "standard spex calibrations ( arc lamps and flats ) were performed after the exposures , and we observed a standard a0  v star at similar airmass to remove atmospheric absorption and calibrate fluxes .",
    "the nuclear region of m32 was observed on 10 june 2010 with the same instrumental setup , number of exposures and integration time .",
    "spectral extraction and atmospheric correction were performed using the spextool package , version  3.4 @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed description of the telluric correction process .",
    "the final spectra of six separate orders were coadded and combined , and are displayed in figure  [ fig : spec ] , along with optical spectra .",
    "l l l c c c c c c    @xmath9 m pa@xmath10 & 0.9971.000 & 1.0121.015 & 1.0021.011 & 0.84  & 2.63  + @xmath11 m cn & 1.0601.070 & 1.0951.105 &  & 1.10 & 1.20 + @xmath12 m pa@xmath13 & 1.2581.265 & 1.2971.305 & 1.2751.289 & 1.75  & 2.89  + @xmath14 m c@xmath2 & 1.7531.763 & 1.7751.785 &  & 1.06 & 1.11    ]    we define four spectroscopic indices ( see table  [ tab : feat ] ) : two are flux ratios of narrow bands bracketing absorption breaks ( 1.08@xmath8 m cn , 1.77@xmath8 m c@xmath2 ) , and two are equivalent widths of hydrogen paschen lines ( 1.00@xmath8 m pa@xmath10 , 1.28@xmath8 m pa@xmath13 ) , where the `` @xmath15 '' reminds the reader that due to the low resolution of the models , other lines are present in the pa@xmath16 equivalent width feature .",
    "the absorption breaks arise from the cool , luminous stars on the tp - agb , while the paschen lines are contributed by hot main sequence turnoff stars in young populations , and thus this method probes two independent stellar phases with very different physical origins ( the cool , extended atmospheres of tp - agb stars vs. the hot atmospheres of msto stars ) .",
    "an enhanced view of the spectra of m32 and ngc  5102 in the regions of the four spectral indices is shown in figure  [ fig : feat ] . to track the dependence of these four indices on age and metallicity",
    "we have measured them in the m05 simple stellar population ( ssp ) models , which cover a large range in both age and metal abundance , and provide an output integrated spectrum for each age and metallicity . in all cases we have used a kroupa initial mass function and a red horizontal branch .",
    "as can be seen qualitatively in figure  [ fig : spec ] , there are clear differences between both the optical and nir spectra of the recent psb galaxy ngc  5102 and the intermediate - age m32 . in the optical the balmer lines are much more prominent , and the k line weaker , in ngc  5102 than in m32 .",
    "likewise , the paschen line series and the two break features due to the tp - agb are significantly stronger in the nir spectrum of ngc  5102 than m32 . to provide a quantitative foundation to these differences and to make a direct comparison with the predictions for spectral index behavior of the m05 models , in figure  [ fig : inds ] values for the four above - defined indices",
    "are plotted as a function of age for the m05 models , at four different metallicities , along with the observed values for ngc  5102 and m32 . due to the high snr of the observed spectra , the formal ( photon statistical ) error bars for the ngc  5102 and m32 index values are actually smaller than the width of the plotted lines .",
    "systematic errors due to , e.g. , flat - fielding issues , subtraction of night sky emission lines , and removal of telluric features , clearly dominate the true uncertainties , and await a more detailed analysis .",
    "it is readily seen that the two absorption break indices , as well as the pa@xmath13 index , first increase with increasing age as the tp - agb becomes more prominent , and then decline at ages greater than @xmath01  gyr , as the rgb overtakes the tp - agb as the dominant contributor in the nir .",
    "the pa@xmath10 index behaves similarly , but with the index first rising and then falling more rapidly with age ( at  100 myr ) .",
    "the two galaxies are seen to have quite distinct sfhs ; the large break indices and large paschen index values in ngc  5102 argue for a young ( @xmath12  gyr ) population with appreciable flux from the tp - agb , and from upper main sequence stars , while m32 shows little contribution from the tp - agb or young stars .        because both ngc  5102 and m32 must have had complicated sfhs and chemical enrichment histories , it is certainly an oversimplification to compare their integrated spectra to ssp model predictions .",
    "the derived ages are really an ssp - equivalent age @xcite , in that the mean age derived from the indices is weighted by the contributions from the entire sfh of the galaxy , which tends to more heavily weight the younger , more luminous , populations .",
    "nevertheless , we can demonstrate that inferences about the sfhs of these two galaxies from the nir spectra concur with previous results obtained at optical wavelengths . in the case of m32 ,",
    "the low values of all four nir indices consistently argue for an ssp - equivalent age @xmath173  gyr , which is in accord with the ages of @xmath04  gyr obtained from optical spectra by worthey ( 2004 ) and @xcite for the central region ; @xcite also find an intermediate - age population in m32 based on resolved star photometry of the rgb .",
    "@xcite find evidence for an old ( @xmath1810  gyr ) population underlying the intermediate age population , each contributing roughly half of the optical light .",
    "the implication is that the ssp - equivalent age results from the combination of an old population , and one no older than @xmath04  gyr . in principle , for instance , the ssp - equivalent age of 4  gyr could arise from the combination of a young , @xmath01  gyr , population superposed on the old population .",
    "however , in @xcite it was found on the basis of spectral indices in the blue that any contribution from a 1 gyr population must be very small .",
    "the nir spectral indices for m32 plotted in figure  [ fig : inds ] certainly supports the conclusion from the optical indices that any contribution from a population as young as 1  gyr must be small .",
    "turning now to ngc  5102 , the most striking aspect of figure  [ fig : inds ] is the contrast between the consistently higher nir indices in ngc  5102 and those in m32 , implying that while the light of m32 is dominated by an intermediate - age population , that of ngc  5102 is dominated by a younger population in which both the tp - agb and hot young main sequence stars make a strong contribution .",
    "the tp - agb signature is evident in the high observed values of the 1.08@xmath8 m and 1.77@xmath8 m break features , while the young main sequence contribution is evident in the high value of the pa@xmath10 index at 1.00  @xmath8 m and to a lesser extent the partially - contaminated pa@xmath13 index at 1.28  @xmath8 m .",
    "two aspects of the behavior of the nir indices with age and metallicity complicate their interpretation .",
    "first , as mentioned , the break indices initially rise with age at @xmath0100 myr as the tp - agb phase develops , then decline beyond @xmath01  gyr as the rgb develops .",
    "the paschen indices behave similarly as the hydrogen lines in upper main sequence stars first strengthen and then weaken with the turnoff temperature .",
    "thus two age solutions are possible for many index values .",
    "however , the pa@xmath10 index peaks at substantially younger ages than the other three indices , so can often lift the age degeneracy .",
    "second , the timing and duration of the index peaks depend on metallicity .",
    "this is due in part to the strong metallicity dependence of the ratio of c - rich to o - rich agb stars in a population : metal - poor populations will have a larger fraction of c - rich giants than their metal - rich counterparts . for ngc  5102 we can assume approximately solar metallicity , because @xcite finds that the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of its disk rgb stars peaks at [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 0.1 , whereas @xcite report that the young nuclear population has [ fe / h]@xmath19 .",
    "the solar metallicity models in figure  [ fig : inds ] show that each of the observed indices for ngc 5102 is consistent with an age of @xmath0300  myr .",
    "the shape of the absorption breaks and the 1.28@xmath8 m indices yield two possible ages from any measurement , but the 1.00@xmath8 m pa@xmath10 feature is sufficiently distinct in age sensitivity to distinguish between a younger and more intermediate age population , and constrains the age to @xmath0300  myr . as mentioned , recent studies of ngc  5102 report a period of star formation lasting several hundred myr and ending within the past @xmath0100  myr , showing that our index values are consistent with the results from established age - dating techniques .",
    "our measured nir spectral indices in m32 and ngc  5102 reinforce the importance of tp - agb constraints on galaxy ages obtained from nir spectra , especially when combined with features that probe the msto .",
    "this technique is particularly useful for distinguishing intermediate age ( @xmath03 - 5  gyr ) galaxies from those dominated by a young ( @xmath01  gyr ) population .",
    "we can further discriminate for the presence of a very young ( @xmath0100  myr ) population on the basis of the pa@xmath10 index .",
    "hence our analysis demonstrates that nir indices allow for a fairly complete description of age and metallicity for a range of stellar population ages that will become accessible with the large lookback times observable with the next generation ir space telescope , the _ james webb space telescope_. specifically , this chronometer will aid in testing models of galaxy formation in the early universe : as a large number of high redshift galaxies are observed in the mid - ir , formation timescales can be constrained with the ( restframe ) nir indices presented here . because @xmath20 galaxies are @xmath212  gyr old ( assuming standard @xmath22-cdm cosmology ) , the tp - agb and young main sequence turnoff will provide much of the integrated flux , and the time of their formation can be determined from the measured nir indices .",
    "we present an analysis of integrated nir spex sxd spectra of the nuclear regions of m32 and ngc  5102 , and show that mean ages determined from spectroscopic indices agree with previous studies , with the important result that this method can differentiate between young and intermediate - age populations . the indices probe contributions from two different stellar evolutionary phases , the tp - agb and the msto , which effectively provides two independent chronometers .",
    "galaxy ages are derived by comparing index values to those measured in m05 model ssps , indicating an accurate treatment of the tp - agb in the models .",
    "this method of defining nir indices is the first step towards a robust nir spectroscopic age - dating technique , which will be particularly useful when applied to high redshift spectroscopic surveys undertaken by the next generation of infrared observatories .",
