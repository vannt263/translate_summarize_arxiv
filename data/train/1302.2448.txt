    "the modeling of chemically reacting flows comprises the interplay between flow ( convection ) , diffusion , and chemical reaction processes .",
    "this interplay is fairly complex if the model is based on a detailed combustion mechanism involving a large number of chemically reactive species and reactions . here",
    "complexity reduction and model reduction methods can be effective tools .",
    "a common aim of many model reduction approaches is the identification ( and computation ) of so called slow invariant manifolds ( sim ) .",
    "many model reduction methods are applied to the chemical source term of the system of reaction transport partial differential equations ( pde ) , which describe the reactive flow .",
    "this means , the model reduction method is only regarding a system of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) modeling the kinetic source term .",
    "trajectories in chemical composition space are relaxing to the sim while converging towards equilibrium . in this sense ,",
    "the sim represent the slow chemistry for a time scale separation between the tangent and normal dynamics .",
    "the existence of a sim is closely related to multiple time scales and time scale separation and a spectral gap in the eigenvalues of the jacobian of the chemical source term characterizes the ratio of contraction rates in tangent and normal directions .",
    "in general , certain species will be chosen as `` represented '' ones for the simulation of the reacting flow based on reduced chemistry models ; these are also called _ reaction progress variables_. these variables parametrize the reduced chemistry model and for these variables the transport pde are actually solved .",
    "the values of the remaining unrepresented variables are computed in dependence of the represented species by considering a point on the slow manifold parameterized by the reaction progress variables .",
    "historically , model reduction techniques have been used since the quasi steady state assumption ( qssa ) and the partial equilibrium assumption ( pea ) became popular ",
    "methods that had to be performed by hand @xcite .",
    "by contrast , modern model reduction methods compute a slow manifold approximation automatically without the need of expert knowledge for identification of reactions in partial equilibrium and species in steady state within a complex chemical reaction mechanism .",
    "a very popular automatic method is the intrinsic low dimensional manifold ( ildm ) method , that has originally been published by maas and pope in @xcite in 1992 , and its extensions .",
    "also the computational singular perturbation ( csp ) method by lam and goussis @xcite is widely applied , e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "another widely applied method , e.g.  in @xcite , is the method of flamelet generated manifolds @xcite . for an overview of model reduction methods ,",

    "there is also a restriction to the choice of the elemental specific moles @xmath18 requiring that the mass fractions sum to one @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the molar mass of element @xmath9 .",
    "this is equivalent to the conservation of the total mass of the system .",
    "energy conservation has to be regarded , too .",
    "we consider systems within one of the four standard thermodynamic environments , i.e.    * isothermal and isochoric * isothermal and isobaric * adiabatic and isochoric ( hence isoenergetic ) * adiabatic and isobaric ( hence isenthalpic )    systems . only the temperature is fixed in the isothermal case , while the specific enthalpy @xmath21 @xmath22 or the specific internal energy @xmath23 @xmath24 respectively , are fixed in the adiabatic cases , where we assume an ideal gas mixture , and @xmath25 is the mean molar mass @xmath26 the molar enthalpy @xmath27 of species @xmath9 is computed by evaluation of so called nasa polynomials @xcite .      in the optimization problem",
    "discussed later in section [ s : variational_problem ] , the dynamics of the system are considered as constraints . therefore , the reaction ode system that is given by the source term only is discussed in the following .",
