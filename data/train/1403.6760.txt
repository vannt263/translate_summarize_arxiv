    "optical analogs of quantum processes @xcite may become a valuable resource for the design of integrated optics devices @xcite . in this spirit , a zoo of optical analogs to quantum mechanical systems and the algebraic methods to solve them provide a valuable toolbox for optical designers . here",
    "we want to show that a quantum analogy may be helpful in the design of optical integrated circuits even when it fails to provide a closed - form analytic impulse function for its optical simulator . for this reason",
    ", we will consider the two - dimensional array of couple photonic waveguides described by the differential set @xmath0 this photonic lattice is a two - dimensional semi - infinite array of waveguides , where the effective refractive index depends from both horizontal and vertical positions in the array , and the couplings between nearest - neighbor waveguides go as the square root of their horizontal or vertical position .",
    "it can be seen as a two - dimensional realization of a glauber - fock oscillator lattice @xcite with some modifications .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this differential set can be cast into a schrdinger equation , @xmath1 , with effective hamiltonian , @xmath2 once we propose the variable change @xmath3 and a wavefunction decomposition @xmath4 where the state @xmath5 is the @xmath6th fock state of the @xmath7 oscillator , and the field at the @xmath8th waveguide is @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the hamiltonian in ( [ eq : optomech ] ) describes an optomechanical model composed by a driven cavity coupled to a mechanical oscillator @xcite . here",
    ", the detunning between the cavity field mode described by the creation ( annihilation ) operators , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , and the pump field frequencies is given by @xmath14 , the frequency of the mechanical oscillator described by the creation ( annihilation ) operators , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is @xmath17 , and the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the strenght of the pump field and the linear coupling between the field and the mechanical oscillator , respectively . up to our knowledge , it is not possible to provide a closed form analytic result for these equivalent models but some approximations can be made in the quantum model .",
    "we will use this insight to predict the behavior of classical light propagating in the photonic lattices .",
    "the trivial case corresponds to the absence of driving in the optomechanical model , @xmath20 , @xmath21 which has been shown to produce non - classical light states @xcite , and its optical analogue is a one - dimensional glauber - fock oscillator lattice @xcite , @xmath22 it is straightforward to diagonalize ( [ eq : effham1 ] ) via the coherent displacement @xmath23 @xcite , such that in diagonal form the effective hamiltonian is given by @xmath24 and leads to a spectrum for the photonic lattice in the form : @xmath25 the impulse function giving the field amplitude at the @xmath6th waveguide given that the initial field was located at the @xmath7th waveguide is @xmath26 and we can recover the terms given by @xmath27 via reference @xcite where @xmath28 stands for the generalized laguerre polynomials @xcite .",
    "it have been shown that the glauber - fock oscillator is equivalent to a harmonic oscillator of constant mass and frequency where , for a fixed effective refractive index , the only way to change the oscillator frequency is the inclusion of second - neighbor couplings @xcite .",
    "thus , in our case a single - waveguide input will produce coherent oscillations and its spatial frequency will remain the same for a fixed effective refractive index , @xmath17 , and variable coupling , @xmath29 , as shown in fig .",

    "so , we may expect some kind of oscillation in the two - dimensional model . in order to gain some intuition",

    "the second term of this hamiltonian is equivalent to that of a trapped - ion setup @xcite and , as long as @xmath37 , we can use the approach used in ion - trap quantum electrodynamics to approximate it to different types of coupling by setting the pump - cavity field detunning to @xmath38 with @xmath39 for positive values of @xmath40 , we obtain @xmath41 and , as far as we know , it is not possible to create an optical analog involving photonic lattices for negative values of @xmath40 .",
    "then , under the condition @xmath37 , if we choose the lattice to show @xmath42 , the horizontal and vertical modes of the lattice should remain effectively uncoupled , as strange as it may sound .",
    "if we choose a paremeter value @xmath43 , then we have : @xmath44 which tells us that horizontal and vertical modes interact such that @xmath9 will effectively couple to @xmath45 .",
    "if we choose a @xmath46 , then the effective hamiltonian is @xmath47 and the nearest - neighbor coupling lattice will behave as if second nearest diagonal neighbors were coupled ; i.e. , @xmath9 will effectively couple to @xmath48 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows a diagram exemplifying these cases .",
    "note that by choosing @xmath49 and staying close to the first waveguides we could neglect the importance of the quadratic term @xmath50 and that experimental considerations should be taken into account for the definition of the parameter ranges as stronger couplings for waveguides far from the zeroth waveguide will induce second- and higher - neighbor couplings .    ) and the effective couplings derived from the quantum analog for parameters @xmath37 and @xmath51 with ( b ) @xmath52 , ( c ) @xmath53 and ( d ) @xmath54 . ]",
    "if we were able to diagonalize @xmath55 , then the impulse function giving the field amplitude at the @xmath56th waveguide for an input at the @xmath57th waveguide would be given by @xmath58 as we mentioned before , we are not able to do so but we can provide certain approximations .",
    "for example , the quantum optomechanical model tells us that if we consider @xmath59 then the effective hamiltonian does not involve any term with the form @xmath60 that relates to coupling between horizontal waveguides in the photonic lattice .",
    "then , we can argue that we will effectively have a series of vertical glauber - fock oscillators which do not see each other .",
    "this is confirmed by the approximate impulse function , @xmath61 this impulse function is just the impulse function of a glauber - fock oscillator in ( [ eq : impfn1d ] ) times a phase factor .",
    "we already know from the harmonic oscillator analog @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] that the oscillation frequency between different single - waveguide inputs is the same .",

    "the lattice size is adequate to keep the propagating field away from the end boundary and the parameters are chosen to fulfill @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",

    "figure [ fig : fig3](a ) shows the fidelity between the original input field and the propagating field , @xmath75 , where the field amplitudes vector is defined as @xmath76 .",

    "in summary , we have shown that analogies between optical and quantum systems may help the optical designer even in those cases where an exact solution can not be procured .",
    "we chose as an example a two - dimensional array of waveguides that is the optical analog of a quantum optomechanical system .",
    "first , we show that the closed quantum model is related to the one - dimensional glauber - fock oscillator and calculate its spectra and impulse function using an algebraic approach that some may find simpler than the bargmann formalism used in the literature .",
    "then , we move to the driven quantum model and bring forward a method used in trapped - ion cavity quantum electrodynamics to approximate the dynamics in a given regime .",
    "such an approach leads us to approximate dynamics where different effective couplings between waveguides appear ; e.g. , uncoupling between columns or effective diagonal coupling .",
    "we chose to work with the case where waveguide columns do not effectively couple , which means that each and every column of the array behaves as an independent glauber - fock oscillator .",
