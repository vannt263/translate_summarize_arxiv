    "since the seminal work by @xcite on broad emission line properties of spiral nebulae , there has been a rapid advance in our understanding of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "a number of spectroscopic surveys of nuclei of nearby galaxies have been performed since then ( e.g. , @xcite ) and large surveys of the local universe such as the 2 degree field survey @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) have characterized properties of agns with an unprecedented statistical accuracy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the realization that black hole mass correlates with host galaxy properties such as bulge luminosity and mass @xcite has triggered a lot of effort to link super - massive black hole growth with galaxy growth .",
    "recent simulations of galaxy evolution seem to achieve some success in reproducing observed properties of galaxies by incorporating energy feedback from agns , although details of such a feedback mechanism are still fairly uncertain @xcite .    in order to perform an observational study of effects of agns on galaxy evolution ,",
    "one first has to identify agns .",
    "agns can be identified in a variety of ways at essentially all wavelengths ( x - rays , mid - ir , and radio detections and optical emission line diagnostics ) .",
    "the energy source of agn activity is the material accreting onto a central super - massive black hole that is heated to high temperature , traveling at high velocity .",
    "it is thought to be the source of x - ray emission due to the inverse - compton scattering of thermal photons from the accretion disk off relativistic electrons .",
    "the surrounding dust torus is heated by the radiation , thus resulting in strong thermal emission at mid - ir wavelengths . in some cases , the central engine ejects jets perpendicular to the accretion disk and they are often observed in radio wavelengths due to the synchrotron radiation",
    ". also , the central engine ionizes the gas in the galaxy out to hundred - parsec to kilo - parsec scales .",
    "the ionization state of the surrounding gas is often higher than normal star forming regions , showing characteristic emission line intensity ratios .",
    "agns exhibit these unique spectral features and agn identification methods aim at detecting them .    in this paper , we focus on optical emission line techniques . @xcite",
    "first presented a method to separate agns from star forming galaxies using flux ratios of four emission lines in the optical wavelengths ( h@xmath1 , , h@xmath2 , and ) . we refer to this diagnostics as bpt in what follows .",
    "agns and star forming galaxies form distinct sequences with some overlap on the bpt diagram .",
    "theoretical calculations based on photo - ionization models have been made to understand the distribution on this diagram ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite performed detailed photo - ionization modeling over a range of ionization parameters and defined a region of the diagram where photo - ionization is unlikely due to stars .",
    "massive spectroscopic surveys of the local universe such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) revealed that star forming galaxies form a tight sequence on the bpt diagram , suggesting that the ionization state of star forming galaxies does not vary so widely as explored by @xcite . @xcite",
    "empirically revised the theoretical curve of @xcite using the data from sdss and this is now a commonly used discriminator between agns and star forming galaxies .    despite the popularity",
    ", however , the bpt diagnostics has disadvantages .",
    "firstly , it requires four emission lines , which are not always easy to measure with sufficient signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "in particular , h@xmath1 can be very weak in low - luminosity agns and it often limits the sensitivity of bpt .",
    "secondly , it requires h@xmath2 and .",
    "these lines migrate to near - ir at @xmath3 and it is hard to measure these lines at high redshifts .",
    "attempts have been made to overcome these issues by using emission lines that are observable even at @xmath3 or by making a priori assumption of host galaxy properties .",
    "@xcite suggested that and @xmath4 could help identify agns when h@xmath2 and are not available .",
    "@xcite showed that /h@xmath1 can be used in place of /h@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed ways to identify agns using a priori assumption about host galaxy properties .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a new diagnostics using /h@xmath1 and stellar mass of the hosts . in this paper",
    ", we make an attempt to overcome the issues with a new , physically motivated method to identity agns . in particular , we do not assume any host galaxy properties a priori as done in yan et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2011 ) and @xcite to identify agns .",
    "this is essential to study relationships between the agn activity and host galaxy properties .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we develop a new method to identify agns in section 2 , followed by extensive tests of the method in section 3 .",
    "we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the method and conclude the paper in section 4 .",
    "nature of low - luminosity agns and their host galaxy properties will be presented in paper - ii . unless otherwise stated , we adopt @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "all the magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we use the following abbreviations : agn for active galactic nucleus , bpt for the @xcite diagnostics , sf for star formation , and sfr for star formation rate .",
    "emission lines used in this work include @xmath8 , h@xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , h@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "as mentioned in the last section , the commonly used emission line diagnostics involves intensity ratios of emission lines to identify a signature of agn .",
    "an ionizing spectrum of agn is typically harder than spectra of young stars , and thus agns exhibit characteristic emission line intensity ratios .",
    "the most commonly adopted @xcite diagnostics involves four emission lines , which are not always easy to measure at high signal - to - noise .",
    "that hinders efficient identification of low - luminosity agns in surveys such as sdss .",
    "however , one does not necessarily have to rely on ratios of emission lines .",
    "a single emission line in principle contains information about an underlying agn .",
    "if a galaxy hosts an agn , the emission line luminosity we observe originates both from star formation and agn :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is an emission line luminosity due to star formation and @xmath17 is a luminosity due to agn .",
    "the idea behind our method is to estimate @xmath16 of a galaxy and compare it with @xmath18 .",
    "if we observe a significant luminosity excess in @xmath18 , it means that the galaxy shows a significant @xmath17 and it likely hosts an agn . in this section ,",
    "we develop a method to estimate @xmath16 and quantify how accurate our @xmath16 is .",
    "then we move on to perform an extensive test of our agn identification method in the next section .      in this paper",
    ", we use data from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 @xcite .",
    "the sdss utilizes a dedicated 2.5 m telescope installed at the apache point observatory @xcite and the survey is in two parts : imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "the sdss has imaged a quarter of the sky in five photometric bands ( @xmath19 ; @xcite ) with unprecedented accuracy @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic survey utilizes double fiber - fed spectrographs and obtains 640 spectra simultaneously covering a wavelength range of 3800   to 9200   with a resolving power of @xmath20 .",
    "each fiber subtends @xmath21 on the sky .",
    "the survey consists of 3 major components : main galaxy sample @xcite , luminous red galaxy sample @xcite , and qso sample @xcite .",
    "the main sample is a flux - limited sample down to @xmath22 selected from the imaging survey and we use objects in the main sample in this paper .",
    "we apply the following criteria to select galaxies for our study : specclass=2 ( i.e. , objects are galaxies ) located at @xmath23 with high confidence flags ( zconf@xmath240.8 and zwarning=0 ) .",
    "we intentionally remove qso - like objects ( specclass=3 ) from the sample because our method is not applicable to those objects ( as shown below , our method assumes that a continuum spectrum is dominated by stars , not by agn ) .",
    "we have 283,031 objects in total , a quarter of which are identified as agns by the method developed in this paper .",
    "we correct the sdss spectra for the galactic extinction using the extinction curve of @xcite and the extinction map from @xcite .      how do we estimate @xmath16 of an emission line ?",
    "it has actually been a long standing issue in agn studies .",
    "agn emission is contaminated with star formation emission and that has often hindered detailed studies of intrinsic agn output .",
    "we can not use any emission lines to estimate @xmath16 because it is hard to discriminate it from @xmath17 .",
    "we have to rely on other available information .",
    "one might use an star formation indicator such as mid - ir emission to measure it , but one faces the same problem  it is difficult to disentangle @xmath16 and @xmath17 in mid - ir .",
    "we take a novel approach to solve the problem .",
    "agns show strong emission lines , but their continuum emission is usually very weak in optical wavelengths , except for very strong agns and quasars @xcite .",
    "we use optical continuum emission of galaxies , which is dominated by stellar light , not by agns , to estimate @xmath16 .",
    "we fit observed spectra of galaxies with model spectral templates of galaxies with various star formation histories to obtain star formation rates ( sfrs ) and dust extinction . from these numbers",
    ", we can work out @xmath16 .",
    "we generate model templates using an updated version of the @xcite code with improved treatment of thermally pulsating agb stars .",
    "free parameters in the models are    * * star formation history : * we assume a simple , exponentially decaying star formation rate to describe star formation histories .",
    "the exponential time scale is allowed to vary between 0 ( i.e. , instantaneous burst ) and @xmath25 ( i.e. , constant star formation rate ) . * * dust extinction : * we use the two component extinction model of @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath26 , which means that 30% of the extinction is due to the ambient interstellar medium , which affects all stars .",
    "the remaining 70% is due to dust in star forming regions , and it affects only stars younger than @xmath27 yr .",
    "we modify the extinction curve of @xmath28 to that of @xcite , which is close to @xmath29 .",
    "we justify the choice of the @xcite curve over the @xcite curve in the appendix .",
    "we allow the optical depth in the @xmath30-band , @xmath31 , to vary between 0 ( i.e. , no dust ) and 3 .",
    "* * metallicity : * we use the solar metallicity models only .",
    "if we include super - solar and sub - solar metallicity models , we introduce too much degeneracies between age , metallicity , and dust and degrade the fits .",
    "we justify the exclusion of non - solar metallicity models in the appendix . * * age : * we apply a logical constraint that the age of an model template must be younger than the age of the universe at a given redshift .",
    "we do not use models with young ages with @xmath32 gyr . due to the degeneracies between the above mentioned parameters",
    ", we can fit galaxies with very young models , but they often give inaccurate sfrs .",
    "the age limit of 1 gyr removes most of such bad fits .",
    "we assume the chabrier initial mass function @xcite .",
    "we fit the observed spectra of galaxies with these templates using the @xmath33 statistics .",
    "we generate sets of the templates with varying stellar velocity dispersions ranging from 75 to 250 @xmath34 with a @xmath35 step and fit the galaxies with the closest dispersion .",
    "we have @xmath36 model templates in each set . in the fitting ,",
    "we mask out regions around strong emission lines such as , h@xmath1 , , h@xmath2 , , , etc , because we want to fit the spectra of stars . in addition",
    ", we mask out a region around 5577@xmath37 , where a strong night - sky oxygen line is located .",
    "the best - fitting models give sfrs , stellar mass , and @xmath31 , which we will extensively use in our analysis .",
    "we derive an uncertainty on each parameter by taking @xmath38 from the best fit . however , due to correlations between adjacent wavelength points of the sdss spectra and also to strong degeneracies between the model parameters , the derived errors may not be accurate . we can empirically measure the errors in , e.g. , @xmath16 by comparing those from direct emission line measurements as shown below .",
    "we subtract the best - fitting model spectra from the observed spectra to obtain continuum - subtracted spectra to measure emission line fluxes .",
    "as summarized by @xcite , population synthesis models are not always perfect and they under / over subtract the continuum in some wavelength regions .",
    "for example , in the case of @xcite model , it often over - subtracts the continuum around h@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we therefore remove the residual continuum by median - filtering the spectra within a running box of @xmath39 .",
    "we then simply sum the fluxes around an emission line to measure its flux within a wavelength range of @xmath40 .",
    "one could fit gaussian to an emission line to measure the flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but agns may well show narrow and broad components simultaneously . as agns are the focus of this work , we do not assume any line profiles .",
    "a fraction of galaxy light is missed from the 3 arcsec fiber . in order to correct for the missing light ,",
    "we compute the slit loss by comparing @xmath41-band magnitude synthesized from the spectrum with the @xmath41-band petrosian magnitude from imaging .",
    "the stellar masses and sfrs of the host galaxies are corrected for the slit losses and are indicated with a subscript _ apercorr _ in figures .",
    "note that this is only a first - order correction because of the assumption employed here that the light in the fiber is representative of the entire galaxy light .",
    "strong agns often exhibit featureless continuum in the uv ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which might affect our spectral fitting and the resultant parameters .",
    "we have checked effects of such featureless continuum by including additional continuum flux in the form of @xmath42 @xcite to the stellar spectra generated with the population synthesis code .",
    "the strength of the featureless continuum ranges from 0 to 30% of an observed spectrum at 5500  with a step of 5% .",
    "we find that such a continuum decreases the accuracy of our spectral fits .",
    "for example , an accuracy of the predicted + [ oiii ] luminosity decreases to 0.35 dex ( we obtain 0.24 dex without the continuum as shown below ) .",
    "furthermore , the best - fitting models often give strong featureless continuum to star forming galaxies selected from bpt ( i.e. , non - agns ) .",
    "these results suggest that such a continuum just increases the degeneracies between the model parameters and does not improve the fits .",
    "it probably makes sense to include the featureless continuum in the fits to study strong agns , but for our purpose of studying low - luminosity agns , we choose not to include it .",
    "the so - called big blue bump seems to disappear in low - luminosity agns @xcite .",
    "this observation adds further motivation not to include the featureless continuum in the fits .",
    "we admit that there is room for improvements in our spectral fitting .",
    "first , we do not use any priors in the fitting .",
    "we may obtain better fits if we use priors on correlations between parameters ( e.g. , one can assume a broad correlation between dust , sfrs , and stellar mass ) , although it is not very straightforward to set priors at high redshifts , where we actually would like to apply the method in the future .",
    "also , one can model more realistic star formation histories by including a secondary burst . despite the simplicity , however , our models deliver good estimates of sfrs and emission line luminosities as shown below .",
    "( 70mm,80mm)fig1a.eps ( 70mm,80mm)fig1b.eps    using the sfrs and dust extinction measurements derived from the model fits , we can now estimate @xmath16 .",
    "but , first of all , we shall quantify how accurate our estimate of sfrs and @xmath31 from the model fits are . in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_vs_obs ] , we compare sfrs from the spectral fits and those from h@xmath2 corrected for extinction using the balmer decrement . for the purpose of quantifying the accuracy of @xmath16 , we remove agns using the bpt diagram with the @xcite threshold from the figure for now .",
    "we use galaxies with all the h@xmath1 , , h@xmath2 and lines detected at @xmath43 here .",
    "we obtain reasonably good estimates of sfrs from the spectral fits , although there is a tilt there .",
    "we apply a biweight fit and find a log - linear slope of 0.63 and the scatter around the solid line to be only 0.23 dex ( a factor of 1.7 ) .",
    "as discussed in the appendix , the tilt and the mean offset becomes slightly larger if we use the original @xmath28 law of @xcite .",
    "note as well that we obtain a better correlation with a log - linear slope of 0.8 if we do not correct for the dust using the balmer decrement .",
    "we will extensively use sfrs from the spectral fits , and we could empirically correct for the observed tilt to obtain more precise sfrs .",
    "but , we choose not to do so because it does not change our conclusions in the paper .",
    "we try not to use empirical calibrations of the outputs from the spectral fitting throughout the paper as long as they do not affect our main conclusions .",
    "while we can estimate sfrs reasonably well , our dust estimates are not as good as we hoped for .",
    "the two component dust model of @xcite does not seem to work very well and our dust measurements are almost always smaller than those from the balmer decrements particularly at low @xmath31 .",
    "the median difference between the two extinction estimates is @xmath44 .    from sfr and @xmath31 , we can work out @xmath16 . in case of h@xmath2",
    ", we use the following equation to derive it :    @xmath45    the conversion factor from sfr to h@xmath2 flux is from @xcite and the factor of 1.7 is applied to change the initial mass function from salpeter ( which is assumed in @xcite ) to chabrier @xcite .",

    "this good correlation might appear surprising given the poor dust estimates , but it is due to the degeneracies between sfr and dust  slightly underestimated sfrs and underestimated dust extinction nearly cancel out and give us good emission line luminosity estimates .",
    "we perform a biweight fit to the data and obtain a log - linear slope of 0.80 .",

    "continuum may provide sfrs on different time scales from those from h@xmath2 .",
    "h@xmath2 comes from star forming regions and is a good probe of instantaneous sfrs , while continuum may provide sfrs smoothed over an extended period .",
    "the scatter we observe in fig .",

    "but , including all these effects , we obtain a remarkable accuracy with only a small tilt .",
    "we find that this scatter does not significantly reduce if we use h@xmath2 measured at @xmath47 only , suggesting that the scatter is primarily due to scatter in @xmath48 .",
    "the errors in the physical parameters from the spectral fits may not be accurate due to correlations between the adjacent wavelength points and to model degeneracies as mentioned above , but the observed dispersion gives us a good quantitative estimate of an error in @xmath48 , which is a factor of 1.4 with a small tilt .",

    "the fact that a fraction of onbn objects are detected in radios ( table [ tab : xray_freq ] ) adds a further line of argument against ew(h@xmath2)@xmath75 .",

    "@xcite observed that nearby early - type galaxies with radio detections show extended emission .",

    "extended line emission is also recently observed by @xcite .",

    "@xcite reported that a fraction of liners show a severe deficit of ionizing photons and need other ionization sources . from these observations",
    ", there is no doubt that the oxygen - excess objects are contaminated by the non - agn emission and at least a fraction of observed emission line luminosities is likely due to post - agb stars .",
    "however , the contributions from post - agb stars may not be very significant .",
    "we will discuss in depth in section 3.3 of paper - ii , but we briefly outline our argument here .",
    "we observe a clear correlation between optical emission line luminosities and hard x - ray luminosities ( fig 3 of paper - ii ) .",
    "post - agb stars are not luminous in hard x - rays and the hard x - ray luminosity is a good measure of agn activity . on the other hand ,",
    "optical emission lines can be significantly contaminated by post - agb photo - ionization .",
    "the observed clear correlation suggests that the contribution from post - agb stars to the observed optical emission is not severe .",
    "the hard x - ray detected sources have typical properties of the oxygen - excess objects ( they have stellar mass of @xmath76 and are mostly red galaxies with low sfrs of @xmath77 ) , thus they represent the oxygen - excess objects well .",
    "one might worry that non - agn sources such as low - mass x - ray binaries may be contributing to the observed x - rays because these binaries often significantly contribute to the overall x - ray emission in massive quiescent galaxies .",
    "but , we show in fig . 5 of paper - ii that the hard x - ray luminosity does not correlate with stellar mass .",
    "the rather weak dependence of x - ray luminosity on the host galaxy mass is also observed by other authors @xcite .",
    "this excludes the low - mass x - ray binary origin of the observed x - rays because their contribution should increase with increasing stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the most likely origin of the hard x - ray is therefore agn and the clear correlation between hard x - ray and optical luminosity shown in paper - ii suggests that the contamination from post - agb stars to the observed emission line is not significant .",
    "the x - ray sample is a just small portion of the entire oxygen - excess objects .",
    "we make another subsample of them to further quantify the role of post - agb stars .",
    "this is a subsample of quiescent ( i.e. , sfr is zero ) oxygen - excess objects in a narrow redshift slice to eliminate any redshift effects .",
    "the emission due to post - agb stars should correlate strongly with stellar mass contained within the area covered by the fibers , while the agn emission is unlikely to be strongly correlated with mass @xcite . within the narrow redshift slice , we find that observed emission line luminosities only weakly depend on stellar mass , which suggests that post - agb stars do not significantly contribute to the overall emission .",
    "based on a very simple model , we find that 23% of the emission is due to post - agb stars in typical oxygen - excess objects with stellar mass of @xmath78 within the fibers .",
    "it seems that a large fraction of o+bn objects are likely agns .",
    "but , we still do not know the exact abundance of non - agns and the exact fractional contribution of the post - agb photo - ionization to the observed emission line luminosities",
    ". we may well have oxygen - excess objects whose emission is completely powered by post - agb stars .",
    "it has been a challenging task to pin down the abundance of true / false agns @xcite and this would probably require deep multi - wavelength observations of the nuclear region of well defined sample of galaxies .",
    "the sdss fibers subtend 3 arcsec on the sky and they include a substantial fraction of bulge and disk components under the typical seeing conditions of the site ( @xmath79 arcsec ) .",
    "we deem that the sdss data are not suited to address the issue in depth .",
    "also , our poor understanding of the last phase of the stellar evolution puts further limit on our ability to constrain the role of post - agb stars .",
    "for these reasons , we do not try to go further from here .",
    "this unknown fraction of contaminating non - agns ( although it will be small ) remains one of the major uncertainties in results presented in paper - ii and a more detailed study of both observational and theoretical aspects would be needed to put a more stringent constraint on the role of non - agn photo - ionization .",
    "we have developed a novel technique to identify agns based on a very simple idea of comparing expected and observed emission line luminosities .",
    "we perform a spectral fits of the sdss galaxies to obtain sfrs and dust extinction , from which we can compute expected emission line luminosities due to star formation . by comparing the expected luminosities with observed luminosities",
    ", we can statistically identify agns . in this comparison",
    ", we use + [ oiii ] luminosities .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that agns span a wide range in ionization state as quantified in paper - ii .    to test the newly developed method , we have made extensive comparisons with the other agn identification methods , namely , bpt , x - rays and radio .",
    "our method suffers from contamination and incompleteness as all the other methods do .",
    "but , the average properties from the stacked spectra and the detection rates of x - ray and radio sources all suggest that the oxygen - excess method is a good statistical method to identify agns . the most unique feature of the method is its sensitivity .",
    "we have demonstrated that our method is applicable to @xmath63 of the galaxies , while bpt can be applied to only @xmath80 .",
    "all the analyses above show that the oxygen - excess method works fairly well in identifying such low - luminosity objects .",
    "another very unique feature , which we have not emphasized in this paper , is its capability to subtract star formation component from the observed emission line luminosity to extract pure agn emission , which is crucial to characterize agn activities .",

    "the oxygen - excess method misses a fraction of bpt agns ( o - b+ ) due possibly to active underlying star formation . it could also be due to strong featureless continuum from agn , which affects our sfr estimates .",
    "we can not easily distinguish these two possibilities as discussed in the main body of the paper .",
    "we thus do not try to characterize their agn activities and host galaxy sfrs .",

    "the o - b+ objects typically have @xmath83 and the fraction is low at the most massive and least massive ends . as we show in paper - ii , the fraction of the oxygen - excess objects is nearly 60% at @xmath84 . the fraction of the missing agns is an order of magnitude lower and they do not affect our results in any significant way .",

    "as detailed in section 4 of paper - ii , the color is @xmath71-corrected rest - frame @xmath85 color and the morphology is characterized with the inverse concentration index @xcite measured in the @xmath86-band .",
    "the o - b+ objects tend to have intermediate color and morphological types , which is similar to the overall properties of the bpt agns ( see paper - ii ) .",

    "<S> we develop a novel technique to identify active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and study the nature of low - luminosity agns in the sloan digital sky survey . </S>",

    "<S> an emission line luminosity in a spectrum is a sum of a star formation component and an agn component ( if present ) . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that an accurate estimate of the star formation component can be achieved by fitting model spectra , generated with a recent stellar population synthesis code , to a continuum spectrum . by comparing the observed total line luminosity with that attributed to star formation </S>",
    "<S> , we can tell whether a galaxy host an agn or not . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our method with the commonly used emission line diagnostics proposed by baldwin et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1981 ; hereafter bpt ) . </S>",
    "<S> our method recovers the same star formation / agn classification as bpt for 85% of the strong emission line objects , which comprise 43% of our sample . </S>",
    "<S> a unique feature of our method is its sensitivity : it is applicable to 78% of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we further make comparisons between our method and bpt using stacked spectra and selection in x - ray and radio wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , while the method suffers from incompleteness and contamination as any agn identification methods do , it is overall a sensitive method to identify agns . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the method can be applied at high redshifts ( up to @xmath0 with red - sensitive optical spectrograph ) without making any a priori assumptions about host galaxy properties . </S>",
    "<S> another unique feature of the method is that it allows us to subtract emission line luminosity due to star formation and extract intrinsic agn luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we will make a full use of these features to study the nature of low - luminosity agns in paper - ii . </S>"
