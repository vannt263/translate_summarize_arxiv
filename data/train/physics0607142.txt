    "the physics of non - sequential double ionization in rare gases by low - frequency , intense laser fields is , to a very large extent , understood . in particular for neon , the electron momentum distributions with peaks at non - vanishing momentum components",
    "@xmath4 , along the laser - field polarization , or the ion momentum distributions peaked at the parallel momenta @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the ponderomotive energy , can be explained by a laser - induced inelastic recollision process @xcite .",
    "specifically , the first electron leaves an atom by tunneling ionization at a time @xmath7 , propagates in the continuum , being accelerated by the field and , subsequently , at a time @xmath8 recollides with its parent ion .",
    "the second electron is then freed by electron - impact ionization @xcite .",
    "this process has been successfully dealt with using an s - matrix approach and its classical counterpart @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if the laser - field intensity is high enough , both quantum - mechanical and classical models yield very similar momentum distributions .",
    "we have shown that this agreement occurs for several types of electron - electron interaction , and in the absence or presence of coulomb repulsion in the electron final states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have verified that the outcome of the classical and quantum mechanical computations also exhibit a striking agreement if the driving field is a few - cycle laser pulse @xcite . in particular ,",
    "both the classical and quantum mechanical distributions are strongly dependent on the so - called absolute phase , i.e. , the phase difference between the pulse envelope and its carrier oscillation .",
    "we have used this fact in order to propose a scheme for diagnosing the absolute phase @xcite , which has also been experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "if one is dealing , however , with more than two active electrons , there are many open questions concerning the physics behind laser - induced multiple ionization .",
    "this is in particular true for triple and quadruple ionization of neon by near infra - red ( @xmath9 a.u . )",
    "laser fields in an intensity range below @xmath10 @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the distributions observed in such experiments , approximately peaked at non - vanishing ion momenta @xmath12 , where @xmath2 denotes the number of electrons involved , hint at a non - sequential physical mechanism .",
    "the theoretical modeling of non - sequential multi - electron processes for @xmath13 , however , poses a far greater challenge than in the two - electron case .",
    "for instance , already for three electrons , which is the simplest scenario to be taken into consideration , one must include at least six feynman diagrams when computing the corresponding transition amplitude , each of which is rather cumbersome to implement .    in order to tackle such a problem , in previous work @xcite",
    ", we constructed a simple thermalization model , similar to those employed in , for instance , nuclear @xcite or molecular @xcite physics .",
    "we assumed that the first electron , upon return , recollides with its parent ion and shares its kinetic energy with @xmath0 bound electrons .",
    "all the @xmath2 electrons are then freed after a time interval @xmath1 subsequent to the recollision time @xmath14 , which , to first approximation , is taken to be constant .",
    "we regard this time as the upper bound for a thermalization time , which is necessary for the kinetic energy to be redistributed among the @xmath2 electrons .",
    "the above - mentioned process takes place within a fraction of the cycle of the laser field .",
    "since the duration of a typical titanium - sapphire pulse , employed in such experiments , is of the order of 2.7 @xmath15 , @xmath1 falls within the attosecond regime .",
    "indeed , recently , by comparing our thermalization model with the available experimental data for triple and fourfold ionization of neon @xcite , we have been able to estimate thermalization times of the order of 460 attoseconds @xcite .",
    "using such a time delay , we computed ion momentum distributions whose widths and peak momenta agreed very well with those in the experiments .    to a very large extent ,",
    "our thermalization model contains classical ingredients and is a generalization of the classical model already employed in the two - electron case @xcite . in @xcite , we have also observed that the peaks and the width of the momentum distributions depend very strongly on the time delay @xmath16 the position of the peaks is a direct consequence of the kinematics involved in the process , as the final drift momentum the @xmath2 electrons acquire from the field , will strongly depend on the time @xmath3 when they reach the continuum .",
    "the above - stated physical mechanism , however , is not completely agreed upon . indeed , it could well be  that a broadening in the electron momentum distributions and the displacement in the peak momenta are caused by , for instance , partially sequential ionization processes @xcite , or excitation tunneling mechanisms @xcite , in which , during the recollision , the electrons undergo a transition to an excited state , from which they subsequently tunnel ( for an example of such mechanisms for different atomic species see , e.g. , @xcite ) . specifically for large thermalization times , the distributions are very much concentrated near vanishing parallel momenta , and resemble those obtained with excitation - tunneling . apart from that , even assuming that thermalization through electron - impact ionization is the only or at least the dominant physical mechanism , it is not clear how the time delay @xmath1 affects the width of the distributions .",
    "another open question concerns the influence of the types of collisions on the momentum distributions .",
    "in fact , for the recombination or rescattering phenomena occurring in the context of atoms in strong laser fields , there exist two main orbits along which an electron may return to its parent ion with the same kinetic energy .",
    "such orbits are known as `` the long orbit '' , or `` the short orbit '' , and have been extensively investigated in the context of high - order harmonic generation and above - threshold ionization @xcite and , more recently , for nonsequential double ionization @xcite .",
    "an electron following the long orbit leaves the atom at a time @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes a field cycle , and returns after the minimum of the electric field , whereas an electron along the short orbit reaches the continuum at @xmath19 and returns before the minimum of the electric field .",
    "hence , in the former and in the latter case the returning electron is decelerated and accelerated by the field , respectively .    in recent years",
    ", both orbits have been investigated in the context of non - sequential double ionization using classical ensemble models @xcite .",
    "in particular , they have been associated to two main types of collisions .",
    "the orbits for which the electron is being decelerated have been related to the so - called `` slow - down collisions '' , whereas the short orbit has been linked to the so - called `` speed - up collisions '' . depending on several parameters , such as the field intensity or frequency",
    ", one type of collisions may provide the dominant contributions to the yield , or both types may be equally important @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the parameters in @xcite , it was shown that the slow - down collisions dominate .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of how the contributions from the short and the long orbit to the multiple - ionization momentum distributions are affected by the time delay @xmath1 , for triple and fourfold ionization .",
    "we are mainly concerned with the influence of both sets of orbits on the width and the peaks of the ion momentum distributions , for resolved and non - resolved ion momentum components transverse to the laser - field polarization .",
    "we take the driving field to be a monochromatic wave or a few - cycle pulse , and make a detailed analysis of the similarities and differences between both cases .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : in the subsequent section , we provide a brief discussion of our thermalization model , with the explicit expressions for the ion momentum distributions . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we display our results for the different sets of orbits , together with the total yields and , finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we state our conclusions .",
    "we will briefly recall the statistical model employed in our previous publication @xcite , in order to determine the momentum distributions in n - fold non - sequential ionization . this model is mainly composed by three main ingredients .",

    "subsequently , this electron propagates under the sole influence of the laser field , and obeys the classical equations of motion . at a later time",
    "@xmath14 , it may be driven back towards its parent ion , recolliding inelastically with it . the return condition @xmath23 for the first electron yields @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the vector potential , and @xmath26 .",
    "( [ tangent ] ) provides a clear geometrical picture for the return condition : for a given @xmath7 , the return time @xmath14 is given by the intersection of @xmath27 with its tangent at @xmath7 @xcite .",

    "[ fewcyc3 ] , we display the ion momentum distributions for quadruple ionization in the few - cycle pulse case , together with the individual contributions from the long and the short orbits .",
    "for a few - cycle pulse , we define such orbits with respect to the pair which gives dominant contributions to the yield . for this specific parameter set ,",
    "this means orbits @xmath112 in fig .",
    "[ phasesp ] .",
    "the long- and short - orbit contributions , i.e. , the individual contributions from orbits @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively , behave in a similar way to the monochromatic - field case ( figs .",
    "[ ne3int ] and [ ne4int ] ) .",
    "indeed , for vanishing thermalization times , the momentum distributions from the slow - down collisions are peaked at a slightly larger absolute momentum than those from the short orbit . for @xmath133 [ fig . [ fewcyc3].(b ) ] , the former and the latter contributions have moved away from or towards @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "once more , as the thermalization time increases , the peaks of both contributions shift towards vanishing ion momenta , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fewcyc3].(c ) .    a qualitative difference , however , between fig .",
    "[ fewcyc3 ] and its monochromatic counterpart is that , for large time delays , one no longer obtains a plateau in the vicinity of vanishing ion momenta , but a single peak in the negative momentum region .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for a monochromatic driving field , the symmetric peaks in the positive and negative momentum regions start to merge .",
    "for a few - cycle driving pulse , on the other hand , by taking an appropriate absolute phase , the distributions can be chosen in such a way that they are concentrated only in one momentum region .",
    "hence , it is possible to avoid that a plateau or a single peak occurs near @xmath102",
    "we have investigated the influence of the shorter and the longer orbit of an electron recolliding inelastically with its parent ion on ion momentum distributions , within the context of a thermalization model for laser - induced @xmath137fold nonsequential ionization . in this model , the first electron , upon recollision ,",
    "shares the kinetic energy it acquired from the external laser field with the remaining @xmath0 bound electrons .",
    "all @xmath2 electrons then leave after a time interval @xmath1 .",
    "we have taken the driving field to be a monochromatic wave and a few - cycle laser pulse .",
    "we have traced the variations in the widths and peaks of such momentum distributions , with respect to the time delays @xmath1 , back to the momentum transfer from the field to an electron traveling along the short or the long orbit , and recolliding with its parent ion .",
    "the momentum transfer is maximal at a crossing of the electric field . with increasing time delays , the time for which the electrons released by a slow - down collision , i.e. , by an electron moving along the long orbit , will leave their parent ion moves away from this crossing . as a direct consequence , the momentum transfer will decrease and the peak momenta will move towards lower absolute values .",
    "the situation is however quite different for the electrons released by a speed up collision . in this case , following the increase of time delay , the release time @xmath3 will initially ( i.e. , for @xmath138 ) approach a crossing , and subsequently ( i.e. , for @xmath83 ) move away from it .",
    "this will make the peaks of the pertinent momentum distributions move to larger absolute values , and then back towards @xmath92 .",
    "the width of the resulting total momentum distributions , as well as their peaks , will result from the interplay between such trends .",
    "this also explains the elongated patterns observed for the momentum distributions , in case the perpendicular momentum of the ion is resolved .    in both monochromatic and few - cycle cases , we considered the dominant pair of orbits , which , for each situation , is chosen in a slightly different way . for monochromatic fields",
    ", we took the two shortest trajectories , i.e. , those for which the first electron spends the shortest time in the continuum .",
    "physically , this pair is dominant , since the spreading of the electronic wave packet is less pronounced than for longer pairs of orbits .",
    "hence , the overlap with bound - state wave packets will be appreciable .",
    "in the few - cycle case , the dominant pair is determined by the interplay between the tunneling rate ( [ quasistatic ] ) for the first electron and the available momentum space .",
    "a pair of orbits will only contribute in a relevant way to the yield if the first electron is ejected with a large probability and if , upon return , it has enough energy to release the second electron ( see , e.g. @xcite , for more details ) .    specifically for few - cycle pulses , we have shown that non - vanishing thermalization times do not play a very important role in determining the shape of  the momentum distributions .",
    "this is due to the fact that a time delay @xmath139 between recollision and multiple ionization only alters the drift momenta the @xmath2electrons acquire from the field when they reach the continuum .",
    "however , this delay does not modify the key ingredients which determine the dominant pairs of orbits and therefore the shape of the momentum distributions : the tunneling rate for the first electron and its kinetic energy upon return . in particular",
    ", both ingredients are highly dependent on the carrier - envelope phase , so that the shape of the momentum distributions can be used for measuring this parameter @xcite .",
    "this means that , even in case there is a non - vanishing thermalization time , one could , in principle , still employ nonsequential multiple ionization for absolute - phase diagnosis .",
    "finally , few - cycle driving pulses may be very useful for testing and validating the thermalization model further , since many other ionization channels , such as excitation - tunneling or sequential ionization , are strongly suppressed in this case .",
