    "the quark - gluon plasma is a short - lived exotic state of qcd matter , in earth circumstances only present in controlled laboratory environments , that is after a heavy ion collision ( e.g.  using pb- or au - ions ) .",
    "the ruling experiments are rhic and the lhc alice facility .",
    "the state of deconfined quark - gluon matter is exotic , not only because it is hard to create but because its properties are not always as expected from a standard plasma @xcite . despite the ultrahigh temperature at which the plasma is existing ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "the plasma degrees of freedom are still strongly coupled , making a perturbative analysis of the physics virtually impossible .",
    "this strong coupling nature of the plasma can be intuitively understood from the observation that the relevant temperature when reexpressed in more appropriate mev units becomes of the order of the fundamental qcd scale @xmath2 , at which the qcd - interaction becomes strong .",
    "a potential extra ingredient to further complicate matters was identified a few years ago @xcite .",
    "it was discussed how a noncentral heavy ion collision can produce very strong ( short - lived ) magnetic fields as well ( @xmath3tesla ) .",
    "such strong magnetic ( @xmath4 ) fields can couple directly to the electrically charged quarks and , via the quarks , also indirectly to the gluons . as this magnetic field is a collective effect",
    ", we can treat it as a classical external field and due to its size , one might expect considerable effects onto the qcd dynamics .",
    "the recent review @xcite contains a pleiad of new strange qcd phenomena directly linked to the presence of a strong magnetic background .",
    "we point out that most studies restrict to a constant ( in time and position ) magnetic field of the form @xmath5 .",
    "there have been given ( model dependent ) estimates of the magnetic field showing that during the initial stages after the collision during which the plasma exists ( @xmath6  fm ) , it is nearly constant @xcite , hence this approximation is a decent one that allows explicit analyses , at least to some extent .",
    "a particular riddle in magnetized qcd is the effect the magnetic field might have on the deconfinement transition .",
    "an approach based on the linear sigma model coupled to the polyakov loop @xcite predicted an increasing @xmath7 in terms of @xmath4 , a result supported by an independent study using the polyakov - nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite , while earlier a nonlinear sigma model analysis predicted a decrease @xcite .",
    "quenched lattice qcd studies on one hand seemed to support a ( slight ) decrease in @xmath7 @xcite at first , but the situation got more or less settled when unquenched results ( full quark dynamics ) became available @xcite ; a direct study of the polyakov loop or ( strange ) quark susceptibility displayed a decreasing critical temperature for the confinement - deconfinement transition .",
    "let us also refer to @xcite for two - color qcd studies",
    ".    by now , also some analytical approximations were worked out which were capable of explaining a decreasing @xmath7 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps interesting to point out here that , frequently , the discussion about the deconfinement transition in a magnetic field is coupled to that of the chiral transition . since quarks couple directly to the magnetic field , one could expect an even stronger response of the chiral transition to the @xmath8-field .",
    "the predictions of the papers @xcite ranged from a split or no split between the two transition temperatures , with the temperatures rising or going down with @xmath4 .",
    "the already mentioned lattice qcd study @xcite in fact was most focused on disfavoring this rising chiral transition temperature , rather showing the ( unexpected ) opposite behavior : the chiral transition temperature also goes down with @xmath4 .",
    "this triggered a lot of attention , see the already cited papers and also @xcite .",
    "in the current note , we will exclusively be interested in the deconfinement transition in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we will employ the contemporary gauge - gravity duality approach @xcite applied to qcd - like theories .",
    "although the original ads / cft duality was not really formulated for a gauge theory like qcd , it is safe to say that the original ads / cft insights inspired quite some activity in gauge theories .",
    "some of these can be called cousins of qcd ( see e.g.  @xcite for some benchmark papers ) while others are effective dual descriptions onto which the ads / cft technology is unleashed , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we will in particular take a look at a specific `` foreteller '' of the deconfinement transition in a specific ads / qcd setting .",
    "we recall here that a famous smoking gun signal of the formation of the quark - gluon plasma is @xmath0-suppression , as proposed in @xcite , a charm - anticharm bound state .",
    "since then , charmonium properties have received a widespread attention . in particular , let us refer to the lattice paper @xcite in which by means of the numerical study of lattice correlation functions , it was found that charmonia can survive the deconfinement transition at critical temperature @xmath7 and continue to exist up to @xmath9 .",
    "we recall here the critical temperature is usually defined and extracted ( approximately ) via the polyakov loop @xcite , a quantity that has no direct connection to observable particle physics . at the level of observable features of the quark - gluon plasma ,",
    "a study of charmonium melting ( dissociation ) at high temperatures might be a more practical way to look at the deconfinement transition",
    ".    we will thus be interested in the melting of charmonia in a holographic model that we believe to capture some essential features of magnetized qcd .",
    "we are not the first to investigate meson melting in ads / qcd @xcite , but to our knowledge , determining how the magnetic field influences the melting temperature has never been considered .",
    "the hope is that this can learn us something about the deconfinement transition in a magnetic field .",
    "usually , in the dual gravitational approach , the quarks are added in a probe brane approximation , following the seminal proposal @xcite . as a result",
    ", the backreaction of the quarks onto the gluonic ( confining or deconfining ) dual geometric background is not taken into account . since it is exactly this background that determines the confinement - deconfinement transition ( via a hawking - page like transition @xcite )",
    ", there is no direct quark effect on the critical temperature @xmath7 .",
    "a fortiori , this means that there is no magnetic field effect either on @xmath7 , since @xmath4 can only couple to the uncharged glue sector via the charged quarks @xcite .",
    "one possible way to make the transition nonetheless @xmath4-dependent was discussed in @xcite , by taking into clever account the pressure of the quark probe branes into the derivation of the critical temperature , while motivating that a complete analysis of the backreaction would be of higher order in the number of flavors over the number of colors .",
    "the result was a decrease in the deconfinement temperature . in the current work , we will investigate how the melting of charmonia is influenced by a magnetic field .",
    "the complication arising is the neutral nature of a @xmath10 bound state , so we will need to couple the magnetic field to the substructure of the bound state .    the paper is organized as follows . in sections ii and iii ,",
    "we introduce a soft wall model that allows to incorporate to some extent the coupling of the magnetic field to the charged quark constituents in the @xmath0 charmonium .",
    "the equations of motions are analyzed in section iv , followed by a numerical evaluation of the spectral functions in section v. subsequently , we compare our results to lattice or other models data .",
    "we also offer an exploratory study of the heavy quark diffusion constant in section vii .",
    "finally , conclusions and an outlook to future research are presented in section viii .",
    "in the soft wall model @xcite , a background metric and dilaton are postulated upon which fluctuations ( two gauge fields and a bifundamental scalar ) propagate .",
    "the backgrounds are given by @xmath11 for the low temperature confined phase - coordinate ranges from 0 ( the boundary ) to @xmath12 ( the center of ads ) .",
    "] and by @xmath13 in the high temperature deconfined phase where @xmath14 .",
    "the radial @xmath15 coordinate ranges from 0 to @xmath16 , the horizon location of the ads black hole .",
    "the temperature of the dual boundary theory is given by the hawking temperature of the black hole as @xmath17 .",
    "+ besides the bifundamental scalar ( which will be irrelevant for our discussions ) , the soft wall action consists of two gauge fields with gauge groups @xmath18 : @xmath19,\\ ] ] whose equations of motion are yang - mills equations in a curved background ( plus dilaton ) .",
    "the original motivation of the soft wall model was to provide an explicit holographic model capable of reproducing the ( linear ) regge spectrum of mesons : @xmath20 , a property which is not that simple to obtain in holographic models ( most models obtain @xmath21 ( e.g. the hard wall model ) ) . instead the soft wall model in the ads background ( [ ads ] )",
    "yields @xmath22 .",
    "the price one pays for this is that the soft wall model does not solve einstein s equations .",
    "since then , models have been constructed that satisfy both of these properties @xcite , though one pays for this in simplicity .",
    "it was the original hope of the authors of @xcite that the model nevertheless would lead to interesting phenomenology and it is with this state of mind that we will proceed .",
    "+ to study the heavy quarkonia , the authors of @xcite suggest choosing a flavor - dependent soft - wall parameter @xmath23 , where the light quarks ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) are combined into a @xmath27 soft wall model and the heavy quark of interest ( charm ) is treated on its own in a @xmath28 abelian model : @xmath29 this proposal immediately dismisses the influence of the heavy - light meson sector ( by choosing @xmath30 ) , but as was illustrated in @xcite , some suggestive qualitative results can be obtained for the @xmath31 meson .",
    "+ the light quark soft wall model is fixed by choosing @xmath32 gev@xmath33 . for the heavy charmonium soft wall model , we instead choose @xmath34 gev@xmath33 .",
    "both of these values have been chosen to fix the mass of the meson to its experimental value : @xmath35 gev and @xmath36 gev .",
    "the lagrangian of the charm sector hence exhibits a stronger damping and it was argued in @xcite that it can be neglected to determine the deconfinement temperature , which equals @xmath37 gev @xcite . from here on , we hence focus on the @xmath28 soft wall model for the charm sector .",
    "+ the idea of @xcite is to consider the spectral peaks in the spectral function and to find out , as the temperature is increased , when the bound states disappear (= melt ) .",
    "if this happens above @xmath7 , the meson melts only at a higher temperature than the deconfinement temperature .",
    "if this happens below @xmath7 , the state melts precisely at @xmath7 itself : the reason for this is that for @xmath38 , the black hole background should not be used anymore since the first - order hawking - page transition will have occurred as the temperature is lowered below @xmath7 .    in @xcite , where the action was originally proposed",
    ", a few words were spent on the origin of the 2 scales , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a priori , only one scale @xmath23 should be present since this @xmath23 is intimately related to the unique principal qcd confinement scale . in principle",
    ", the latter should correspond to the string tension , as mentioned in @xcite , but the underlying soft wall model does not even support a string tension , in the sense that the wilson loop does not display an area law to begin with @xcite .",
    "the charmonium mass is mostly dictated by the constituent charm quark mass , which is an order of magnitude larger than the confinement scale , nonetheless we fixed , following @xcite , the second scale @xmath40 to faithfully reproduce the mass of the @xmath0 .",
    "analogous to @xcite , we consider to constitute a pragmatic first trial to study nontrivial charmonia properties .",
    "similar approaches as in @xcite can be found in @xcite . + nonetheless , in soft wall models it can be motivated that @xmath40 will dynamically change its value w.r.t .",
    "@xmath39 due to back reaction effects of the heavy quark sector on the geometry . a back reaction study in a hard wall setting @xcite revealed in particular that an effective soft wall model is recovered with a @xmath23 depending on the heavy quark mass .",
    "quite likely , a similar phenomenon will take place starting with a soft wall model , if we were smart enough to carry out the involved analysis .",
    "+ as was noticed in @xcite , many other papers following the so - called top - down approach to qcd where holographic models directly rooted in string theory are used to understand essential qcd features @xcite suffer from the same problem , since only a single scale is governing the dynamics , whereas dual descriptions of charmonia need at least two .",
    "+ in the meantime , more involved holographic charmonium models became available on the market , see e.g.  @xcite , where additional parameters are introduced to also provide a realistic charmonium decay width etc .",
    "this goal is essentially achieved by making a wise choice for the dilaton profile . for",
    "now , we leave these for further study , and focus here on the generalization to the magnetic field case of the pioneering model @xcite .",
    "+ the charm vector modes are defined via @xmath41 and these are the ones we are interested in . for our purposes , this action is not sufficient to handle a background magnetic field .",
    "indeed , the linearity of maxwell s equations implies for the decomposition @xmath42 : @xmath43 where the first term vanishes due to the fact that a constant magnetic field solves the soft wall maxwell equations of motion .",
    "this means the fluctuations do not feel that the magnetic field is turned on .",
    "the @xmath0 particle is a charm - anticharm bound state and hence is uncharged .",
    "the fact that it does not couple to a magnetic field is quite natural : only the interior quarks feel the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "state is like an electric dipole whose charges are bound to each other by the strong force . ] to overcome this feature , one might be tempted to take a non - abelian gauge field instead ( for instance mixing the charm with the top quarks ) .",
    "this would lead to non - abelian interaction terms present in the equations of motion that can couple a background field to a fluctuation .",
    "this is not the right thing to do : the uncharged mesons ( the @xmath0 and the @xmath44 ) would still not feel the magnetic field , whereas all we would have accomplished is the study of the influence of the magnetic field on the _ charged _ mesons ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 in our example ) .",
    "+ instead of doing this , we need to be able to probe the internal structure of the meson with a magnetic field . in the past , the born - infeld non - linear electrodynamic model was proposed to overcome the infinite self - energy of a static point - charge @xcite ( see also the book @xcite for a nice discussion on this ) .",
    "the crucial feature that emerges is the appearance of a new length scale : point - charges in the theory acquire a self - energy that is of the form of an extended object on the order of this length scale . in string theory",
    "these equations reappear where the new length scale is the string length @xmath47 .",
    "hence in that case , maxwell s equations hold for scales larger than the string scale , smaller length scales require utilizing the born - infeld action ( or its d - brane cousins ) .",
    "since the general spirit of holographic models is to use strings as a guide ( these being roughly identified with the gauge strings ) , we are led to using the bi - action as a plausible guess of an extension of the soft wall model , capable of probing the internal structure of mesons .",
    "+ the dbi action naturally appears in top - down constructions of confining gauge theories , as it describes the fluctuations of the underlying d - branes .",
    "let us for example refer to the sakai - sugimoto model ( d4/d8 ) @xcite or d4/d6 models of @xcite .",
    "the mesons of the dual gauge theory are identified with these fluctuations .",
    "also in these setups , submesonic dynamics can be taken into account . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us mention that in @xcite , it was found that a magnetic field has an influence on the vector ( @xmath48 ) meson spectrum , this partially due to the quark constituents response to the magnetic field .",
    "in different work , the internal meson structure was studied via the form factors / parton distribution functions @xcite , see also the review @xcite .",
    "such analyses can be carried out by either using bottom - up hard / soft wall models , the top - down models mentioned before or the polchinski - strassler background @xcite .",
    "+ the action we use is the dbi - version of the soft wall model @xmath49 for left- and right - handed @xmath50 gauge bosons .",
    "the prefactors have been chosen in such a way as to precisely yield the correct prefactor for the @xmath51 term in the expansion .",
    "thus this action can be seen as a generalization of the conventional soft - wall model ( [ softwall ] ) in which interactions of the gauge field have been included in this specific form .",
    "we take the gauge field to be a background plus a fluctuation @xmath42 and we determine the equations of motion for non - self - interacting fluctuations ( quadratic in the action , could also mix with the @xmath0 , see @xcite , but again due to the intrinsic parity , this can at the ( holographic ) qcd - level only happen due to the chern - simons piece of the action ( which represents the triangle anomaly ) . in the current work we will ignore this chern - simons contribution as it is relatively suppressed w.r.t .",
    "the dbi - action with an extra ( supposedly large ) t hooft coupling constant . for a similar comment at the level of @xmath48 and @xmath52 mesons ,",

    "an anomalous mixing between @xmath53 and @xmath0 by means of a magnetic field was also reported in @xcite . ] ) , but exact in the background field . in writing down this action",
    ", we have implicitly neglected all forms of interaction between left and right modes .",
    "we restrict our study to only vector - modes , hence both actions above are actually the same . , terms in the lagrangian only have an even number of axial gauge fields .",
    "since we are restricting ourselves to the part quadratic in the fluctuations , the axial part has no influence at all on the vector part we are interested in .",
    "note that when including the background magnetic field in the vector part , terms with field factors such as @xmath54 might be worrisome , even for the quadratic part .",
    "luckily such terms are absent . ]",
    "+ it is important to emphasize that , for vanishing background electromagnetic field , the ( quadratic part of the ) model reduces to the normal soft - wall maxwell action .",
    "thus it encompasses the successes of the latter but still allows interactions with a background field in the bulk which are controlled by a further ( dimensionful ) parameter @xmath55 .",
    "before delving into the computations of the fluctuations in this model , let us first set up the model in a proper way . we will show that a constant magnetic field is in fact a solution to the soft - wall dbi equations of motion ( without backreaction ) . after that , we will present a method to fix the additional parameter @xmath55 .",
    "a constant background magnetic field can be modeled by turning on a constant @xmath56 while keeping the other components zero .",
    "our first goal is to demonstrate that this background magnetic field solves the dbi equations of motion ( eoms ) in the soft wall background .",
    "we start with @xmath57 for a fixed background dilaton and ( string ) metric . varying this action with respect to @xmath58 yields @xmath59 which gives @xmath60 = 0.\\ ] ]",
    "the specific form of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and the candidate @xmath63 ( only 1,2 and 2,1 indices which are constant ) , shows that nothing is dependent on any other coordinate than @xmath15 .",
    "thus @xmath64 is the only possibility .",
    "but if @xmath64 , @xmath65 should be @xmath15 as well ( due to the specific form of @xmath66 ) .",
    "but then both terms cancel each other and indeed this candidate @xmath63 solves the eoms in this particular soft wall background .",
    "let us next try to fix the additional parameter @xmath55 that we introduced in the previous section .",
    "it is known @xcite that the soft - wall model background does not predict a satisfactory wilson loop ( which is the prototypical way to fix @xmath55 ) .",
    "another quantity that might allow us to fix @xmath55 is the polyakov loop .",
    "its value has been computed holographically for several theories @xcite and shows remarkable similarity to lattice results .",
    "we compute the vacuum expectation value of the polyakov loop in terms of a surface spanning a thermal loop at the boundary . to this effect",
    ", we evaluate the on - shell nambu - goto action for a string surface wrapping the thermal boundary circle .",
    "the resulting surface is cigar - shaped and depicted in fig .",
    "[ poly ] .        the euclidean nambu - goto action",
    ", @xmath67 can be evaluated in worldsheet coordinates aligned with the space coordinates as @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we look for static solutions . for the ads@xmath70 black hole metric",

    "has an absolute minimum when considering configurations for which @xmath74 . ]",
    "the on - shell action hence becomes @xmath75 after introducing a cut - off at @xmath76 , the polyakov loop becomes @xmath77 in general , the resulting expression in the exponential consists of two parts : one part is proportional to the circumference of the loop in the boundary theory whereas the other is not .",
    "the part that scales with the circumference at the boundary is multiplied by a divergent quantity and the prescription instructs us to drop this part @xcite , see also @xcite for a renormalization analysis of the polyakov loop .",
    "we hence renormalize this expression by subtracting the @xmath78 divergence so that we obtain @xmath79 our holographic exercise shows that in this model , the polyakov loop is temperature independent ( which is of course not exactly what is seen from lattice studies , the most accurate way to effectively compute the polyakov loop ) .",
    "our best bet is then to take the asymptotically constant value and fit our result to this .",
    "lattice computations ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) do indeed show that for large @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 is about @xmath83 . using this value immediately yields @xmath84 this is sufficient since , knowing that the metric is proportional to @xmath85 , the dbi action can be rewritten as @xmath86 and all powers of the ads length drop out from the equations of motion",
    ". we can hence simply set it to @xmath87 ( like for the normal soft wall model ) .",
    "the important feature ( for which no computation is necessary ) is that the string length and the ads length are of the same order : the ( inverse ) qcd scale . + it is perhaps useful to remind the reader here that the poyakov loop , just as the wilson loop , is typically computed for a heavy quark pair , this to avoid of having to deal with the issue of dynamical string breaking .",
    "it is from this perspective thus rather natural to fix the new scale we introduced , @xmath55 , using the ( heavy ) charm dbi - action .",

    "+ to summarize , a frobenius analysis around the horizon ( @xmath129 ) shows that the asymptotics for both of these differential equations is given by @xmath136 which is hence not altered by turning on a background magnetic field . note that since @xmath137 , no extra singularity is created at all by turning on a magnetic field .      in the boundary limit @xmath138",

    "it is beyond doubt clear that the magnetic field does influence the melting , and as such , it gives support to the picture that the deconfinement transition depends on the applied magnetic field , although in a more involved way than the polyakov loop picture might suggest @xcite . let us mention here that we did not need to make the soft wall background itself dependent on the magnetic field to find a nontrivial effect .",
    "although our analysis might seem to correspond to a probe brane approximation , this is actually to be loosely interpreted , since it would be useless to consider the backreaction of the magnetic field on the soft wall metric , since the latter does not solve itself einstein s equations .    as a further application",
    ", one might want to look at a background electric field .",
    "however , a moment s thought shows that this immediately leads to an imaginary part in the action , no matter how small the applied @xmath258 field . in general , one expects a schwinger - type effect to take place only as soon as the confining force is conquered by the applied field @xcite .",
    "the soft - wall dbi model is hence not capable of predicting this expected phenomenon correctly . in general",
    ", soft - wall type models appear to be less powerful in predicting properties directly related to the confining force ( wilson loop with area law , electric breakdown etc . ) , but its strength lies in the prediction of the ( linear ) meson regge trajectory , and it is our hope that these poles have been qualitatively predicted using our dbi - modification of this model .",
    "we also presented a preliminary analysis of the relative heavy quark diffusion constants for longitudinal and transversal modes .",
    "the former modes display a stronger diffusion than the latter ones .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that this observation might have interesting consequences for the elliptic flow in the medium @xcite , which is anyhow related to anisotropy . since the collision process creates the magnetic field , another proponent of anisotropy as we have confirmed e.g.  in the melting or transport properties of our model , it looks worthwhile to pursue this in more detail",
