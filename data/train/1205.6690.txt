    "the concept of approximation is an important concept throughout the realm of mathematics .",
    "many different approximation algorithms have been developed , which are used in various contexts . but",
    "despite the variety of algorithms , there seem to be particular mechanisms which some of these algorithms have in common .",
    "for instance , many approximations are based on the existence of a fixed point for a certain contractive mapping , so that under the right conditions , iterated application of this mapping will approximate this fixed point .",
    "much theory has been developed to capture this phenomenon , and its theorems are widely applicable ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in this master thesis",
    "we will focus on a different approximation mechanism , which also seems to underlie many known approximation algorithms .",
    "it goes about as follows : we have an object @xmath1 , on which we will apply a sequence of mappings .",
    "after each of these mappings , our @xmath1 has changed , and we record the essential information of this result before going to the next mapping ( for example we repeatedly differentiate a function , and after each time we record its value in a point @xmath2 ) . then , after having recorded these values up to a certain level , we try to reverse process all these mappings , using just the data we have collected so far ( for example we repeatedly integrate a function from the point @xmath2 , using the recorded values in @xmath2 as the constants of integration ) . in many examples ,",
    "this algorithm turns out to give good approximations for the initial object @xmath1 . the more of the recorded coefficients we involve in our approximation , the more accurate it generally becomes .",
    "this observation should motivate further investigation to this general principle , and we will refer to these algorithmic structures as _ expansion systems_.    besides the example of taylor series , which ( as the reader may have figured out ) just served to illustrate the underlying mechanism of expansion systems , there are many more approximation algorithms that can be viewed in this perspective .",
    "there is the decimal expansion , fourier series , continued fraction , engel expansion , newton s forward difference formula , and so on .",
    "we will come across all of these examples as the theory of expansion systems is being unfolded .",
    "+ in section 1 of the thesis , a formal description of expansion systems is given , which will serve as the main framework for all later sections . in section 2 , we will discuss some basic features of expansion systems regarding the approximations it provides .",
    "as we will see , the objects that arise as approximations will actually have much more meaning in the context of expansion systems , than just being an approximation . in section 3",
    ", we will develop the theory which is essential for investigating the convergence of expansion system .",
    "we will also prove some elementary convergence theorems , as well as a convergence result for the class of _ monotonic expansion systems_. the subject of section 4 is isomorphisms between different expansion systems .",
    "the concept of isomorphisms may help us to translate results from one expansion system to another , whenever such an isomorphism can be established .    in the final appendix , we will shed some light on a type of approximations , called _",
    "approximation systems_. in a somewhat different setting , these type of approximations have been the subject of the author s bachelor thesis _ approximation systems _ ( in dutch : benaderingsstelsels)@xcite , and they are also the subject of the identically named paper@xcite , coauthored by prof . koornwinder . in this thesis , we will reformulate this type of approximations in the context of expansion systems .",
    "as of yet , there is still a discrepancy between the results regarding approximation systems that have been establish theoretically , and the results that have been experimentally obtained .",
    "for the treatment of the subject in the appendix , i have decided to especially share the more practical results , accepting the lack of foundation to prove them .",
    "+ the subject of this thesis came into being during work on the article _",
    "approximation systems_. prof .",
    "koornwinder asked me to find out whether other types of approximation algorithms could somehow be fitted into the theory of approximation systems , and after much puzzling i decided that this was going to be difficult .",
    "however , there were nonetheless some basic principles which the approximation systems shared with other types of algorithms , and it became clear that there is in fact a general framework which all of these algorithms would fit in .",
    "when i decided to work out this idea as the subject of my master thesis , it was not quite clear to me yet , how much more i would be able to write down , besides the very definition and a couple of examples .",
    "but along the way , it appeared that there was actually quite a lot of theory to explore , and an initial habit of searching for content , soon enough changed into a habit of focusing on just a couple of basic features .",
    "i can therefore only apologize for all possible omissions , that probably would better have been included into this thesis . for example , like prof .",
    "homburg has remarked , it would make sense also to discuss the situation in which the expansions are linear maps .",
    "although some of the examples in this thesis do belong to this category , such as the taylor expansion and the fourier series , a general theory for linear expansion systems is not given . and as prof .",
    "koornwinder suggested , also the theory of fast wavelet transforms could possibly be linked to expansion systems , but this hasnt made it into the final thesis either .",
    "hopefully , future efforts will fill in gaps like these .      to begin with ,",
    "i want to acknowledge prof .",
    "dijkstra and prof . van mill for their help with some topological issues .",
    "they have been of great support when i got stuck with a topological problem .",
    "further , i want to acknowledge prof .",
    "after all , it have been the fruitful conversations with him , that have been the main inspiration for this thesis , and i thank him for the great care with which he has guided me in the last couple of years .",
    "finally , i want to thank my supervisor prof .",
    "besides all his other help , i am very grateful for his willingness and the freedom he has given me , to let me work on something what was actually just a spontaneous idea .",

    "these mappings define a proper es @xmath65 , for we have that @xmath140 is bijective , with inverse : @xmath513 which evaluates to @xmath30 in case @xmath514 . in the context of our es ,",
    "all these expressions are formally to be interpreted as just germs in @xmath2 , but as we will see later , they have more practical value than just representing germs .    the expansions @xmath14 can be decomposed into @xmath444 and @xmath445 , where : @xmath515 as the first of these maps is bijective on the space of germs with constant term @xmath30 , we have by theorem [ th isom shift ] that our @xmath65 is isomorphic with @xmath334 , where : @xmath516\\!(x_0)\\;,\\;m(y)\\;),\\\\ e_i'\\,y(x ) & = d_x\\,\\left(\\frac{y(x)}{\\left[(x - x_0)^{m(y)}y\\right](x_0)}\\right)^{\\alpha_i}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that we have : @xmath517 in fact , the formulation of @xmath334 has been the underlying principle in @xcite , whereas the formulation of @xmath65 coincides with the formulation in @xcite . as @xmath518 gives an isomorphism between the spaces @xmath5 and @xmath447 , and @xmath447 does not have the restriction of having constant term @xmath30 , it is clear that this restriction on @xmath5 is actually not that limitative .",
    "in fact we could drop this restriction on @xmath63 ( i.e. we take as initial space @xmath415 ) , and in a similar way as we have mentioned in example [ ex dec exp 2 ] , we let our first expansion be given by simply @xmath519 , keeping all further expansions just as they were .",
    "then the es can be applied to any holomorphic germs .    as we havent fixed the value of @xmath509 in the as in example [ ex app sys 1 ]",
    ", it actually represents a whole collection of as s .",
    "we will now consider some particular instances of it .",
    "when each @xmath520 , it can easily be verified that the approximations are just the taylor approximations ( besides the restriction in @xmath63 on the constant term , the main difference with the approximations provided by example [ ex taylor ] , is that here the @xmath71-th order convergent gives the first @xmath110 non - zero terms of the taylor series , whereas in example [ ex taylor ] the terms up to and including order @xmath110 will be given ) .    more generally ,",
    "when each @xmath509 is a positive unitary fraction @xmath521 with @xmath522 , then the resulting approximations will be polynomials . using concise notation , such as we have used in and , we can write the approximation process as : @xmath523 using local coordinates @xmath524 , and where @xmath525 .",
    "this expression suggest that this es is actually accurate .",
    "of course , by theorem [ th conv weakly discrete top ] we have convergence in the weakly discrete topology .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that this means that the first @xmath110 non - zero taylor coefficients of the @xmath71-th convergent coincide with the first @xmath110 non - zero taylor coefficients of the initial function @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "this means we have also weak convergence in the sense that the derivatives of all orders convergence in the point @xmath2 .",
    "but in practice we often have even more than that .",
    "consider the situation in which each @xmath526 , and look at the element @xmath527 and @xmath528 .",
    "then reduces to : @xmath529 the coefficients @xmath53 in this formula , have been moved outside of the integrals .",
    "the first few convergents are given by : @xmath530}(x)&=1\\\\ y^{[1]}(x)&=1+\\frac{x}{2}\\\\ y^{[2]}(x)&=1+\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{3 x^2}{8}+\\frac{3 x^3}{32}\\\\ y^{[3]}(x)&=1+\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{3 x^2}{8}+\\frac{5 x^3}{16}+\\frac{175 x^4}{1024}+\\frac{147",

    "this has been proven for all powers @xmath531 . however , despite the fact that the head of all these polynomials coincides with the taylor series , computer simulations have pointed out that the actual domain of convergence is in fact larger than this open disk , and thus not symmetric .",
    "of course , the domain of convergence _ is _ symmetric in the complex direction , and the pole in @xmath532 lies on its boundary .",
    "what the exact contours are , remains nonetheless a challenging question .    in the example",
    "above , if @xmath5 would be defined as a space of holomorphic functions on a fixed neighborhood @xmath145 of @xmath2 , then we can always find a function @xmath1 on which @xmath14 is not well - defined , as it would introduce a branch point to @xmath145 . and",
    "at the same time , possibly this @xmath1 _ could _ be successfully approximated , if only our domain was somewhat smaller than @xmath145 . in the formulation with germs",
    ", the algorithm applies without problems to all relevant functions . in the subsection _ further aspects of approximation systems",
    "_ we will briefly discuss an alternative formulation , which could possibly solve this issue in a yet different way .",
    "we have allowed the @xmath509 in example [ ex app sys 1 ] to depend on @xmath56 , and it is indeed possible to vary @xmath509 as @xmath56 increases .",
    "for example , when we let @xmath509 run through @xmath533 and we look at @xmath534 , then we get the expansion : @xmath535 although the convergence of this formula turns out to be very fast , it also requires much more effort to evaluate than a taylor series .",
    "so far we have only considered unit fractions , which give polynomial convergents .",
    "another possibility are positive integer @xmath509 .",
    "for instance , when we let @xmath509 run through @xmath536 instead , and pick @xmath537 again , then we get more or less the opposite of : @xmath538{1 + 3!\\int_0^{x_2 } \\displaystyle\\sqrt[4]{\\bigl . \\ldots\\bigr . }",
    "\\ dx_3}\\ dx_2}\\ dx_1.\\ ] ] here , the convergents are no longer polynomials , but more complex expressions .",
    "symbolic computation is impossible for higher orders of the convergents , and so the only option seems to be numerical evaluation , or computations in terms of power series .",
    "although the appearance of the factorials in the last two formulas for @xmath539 may seem remarkable , they are actually imposed by our choice of @xmath509 . for example",
    ", if we would keep @xmath509 constant as in , then the coefficients form a geometric sequence instead .",
    "the first two of these formulas show a regular pattern .",
    "in fact , we can view these two formulas as a repeated application of an operator @xmath542 , for which @xmath1 is a fixed point .",
    "for instance , in we have : @xmath543 which has as fixed point @xmath539 .",
    "the reason that there exists such an operator @xmath542 , is that the initial function @xmath1 satisfies a finite cycle of differential equations , determined by . in this case , it is a cycle of length @xmath167 . in general , if we are given a cycle of equations : @xmath544 then the solution may also be found by a picard iteration : @xmath545 on a multi - dimensional @xmath546 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for this",
    ", we set @xmath547 as : @xmath548 and as constant of integration simply @xmath549 .",
    "of course , the algorithm still applies when there is no such cycle for @xmath1 .",
    "the third formula is an example of this , and its coefficients do not follow an obvious pattern .",
    "such continued fraction - like expressions can be obtained for every analytic function , and for most it will require quite some effort to calculate the coefficients .",
    "furthermore , the convergents can not be expressed in terms of elementary functions for high orders of @xmath71 .",
    "for example , in we can only determine the convergents up to and including order @xmath168 : @xmath530}(x)&=1\\\\ y^{[1]}(x)&=1+x\\\\ y^{[2]}(x)&=1-\\log(1-x)\\\\ y^{[3]}(x)&=1+e\\cdot{\\mathrm{li}}\\,\\frac{1}{e}-e\\cdot{\\mathrm{li}}\\,\\frac{1+x}{e},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath552 denotes the logarithmic integral .",
    "for the orders @xmath553 , we have to rely on numerical methods to evaluate the expression .",
    "although the rate of convergence of the above formulas turns out to be rather slow , its domain of convergence is surprisingly large . in the situation of",
    ", the approximations even seem to converge when we evaluate them on paths going around the branch point of @xmath554 , when @xmath555 is not a nonnegative integer .",
    "we will come back to this observation at the end of this appendix . before that , let us consider two more examples of as s .",
    "[ ex app sys 2 ] unlike example [ ex app sys 1 ] , we now let @xmath5 be the space of holomorphic germs at @xmath2 with constant term @xmath29 , and @xmath463 .",
    "we let @xmath64 and @xmath13 be just as in example [ ex app sys 1 ] , but now we set @xmath556 if @xmath92 , and otherwise : @xmath557 these mappings define a proper es @xmath65 , for we have that @xmath140 is bijective , with inverse : @xmath558 which evaluates to @xmath29 in case @xmath514 .",
    "this as provides us with formulas such as : @xmath559 for clarity , we put the variable of integration in front of the integrand , instead of behind .",
    "the first of these formulas can be viewed as iterating a single operator , like we saw with and . in this case",
    ", the operator entails only one integration in total , as the cycle of differential equations consists merely of the equation : @xmath560 in other words , this formula just expresses a picard iteration .",
    "note that in equation [ eq exp as 1 ] , we have multiplied both sides of the equation by a factor @xmath561 afterwards . the second formula does not arise from a cycle of differential equations , and so the coefficient do not follow a cycle either .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that both of these formulas converge on a certain domain ( as for , which is equivalent to a picard iteration , this should not come as a surprise ) .",
    "[ ex app sys 3 ] in this example , we let @xmath5 consist of the germs with constant term @xmath30 again , as in example [ ex app sys 1 ] , but now we let @xmath562 .",
    "further , we let @xmath14 be the composition of maps @xmath446 and @xmath448 , where @xmath448 is defined as in , and @xmath446 is the composition @xmath563 , where @xmath564 .",
    "this basically means that @xmath446 first differentiates a function , and chops off the constant term afterwards .",
    "note that this @xmath446 is nt bijective any longer .",
    "we set @xmath13 to : @xmath565 these mappings define a proper es @xmath65 , and @xmath140 is bijective , with inverse : @xmath566 we may verify that this expression is mapped to @xmath1 by @xmath14 , and that the projection @xmath13 indeed gives the parameters @xmath567 .",
    "we have just seen some examples of approximation systems , as well as the kind of results it gives .",
    "this may have sparked a couple of questions .",
    "first of all , what is the meaning of all these formula s ? as noted before , when we interpret the equations as dealing with germs , the equality symbol expresses that the left hand side is the limit of a sequence defined by the right hand side , namely in the weakly discrete topology .",
    "but in many cases , the expressions do also converge in the more common topology .",
    "for some particular cases , this has been established in @xcite . for many others ,",
    "this has only been suggested by numerical simulations .",
    "although for some as s the rate of convergence can be really high with respect to particular elements @xmath1 , in most cases this does not seem to compensate for the effort necessary to ( numerically ) evaluate these kind of expansions . of course , it may well be that there are situations in which the algorithm really serves practical purpose , but in other situations it would probably not be the prime motivation to study these identities .",
    "probably more interesting is the fact that these expansion do converge in the first place , also when it involves quickly increasing functions such as in .",
    "even more remarkable , is that the domain of convergence can take extraordinary shapes .",
    "we already mentioned this regarding and .",
    "for the first of these , we know for sure that its domain of convergence is at least the open disk with radius 1 ( see @xcite ) , but evaluating the algorithm numerically , we find a domain which is considerably larger than that , delimited by a very irregular boundary , with even fractal like characteristics . as for now",
    ", we could only speculate about what this is supposed to mean .    at equation",
    ", we already mentioned that here the approximations seem to converge , even when going around the singularity at @xmath573 for @xmath574 .",
    "what we mean with this is the following .",
    "let s first choose a parametrization @xmath575\\rightarrow { { \\mathbb{c}}}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ ] of a path going around the origin ( this could be @xmath576 for example , but if we are performing a numerical simulation , a path in the shape of a square would also do ) .",
    "next , we evaluate the expansion given in up to a certain order , but when calculating the integrals , we restrict ourselves to the path @xmath577 .",
    "then , we determine the values of @xmath554 on the same path @xmath577 by analytic continuation ( if @xmath576 , this is just @xmath578 ) .",
    "if our @xmath577 does nt happen to have crossed a singularity of some @xmath81}$ ] ( of which there can only be finitely many ) , it turns out that the approximated values of @xmath66}$ ] on @xmath577 , converges to the value of @xmath1 on this @xmath577 , as @xmath71 gets larger . in somewhat loose notation , this means : @xmath579 where the integration variables @xmath580 run through the domain @xmath581 $ ] . as long as @xmath577 does nt accidentally cross some singularity like we just mentioned , this identity always seems to hold , no matter what the end point of @xmath577 is , and how many times it has turned around the singularity at @xmath573 . performing a similar procedure on the taylor expansion ( viewed as an as ) , we do nt have this property . for example",
    ", picking @xmath576 , we can find either by calculation or by reasoning , that : @xmath582 which diverges for @xmath583 .    in order to study this kind of convergence behavior for as s in general , it may be desirable to give a different formulation of as s .",
    "possibly , we could let the spaces @xmath5 consist of multilayered functions covering the complex plane , allowing different functions to live on different domains , but each of these domains being marked with a certain basepoint @xmath2 .",
    "then the expansions @xmath14 determine a transition from one multilayered function to another , which might as well alter the riemann surface a function lives on . if we want to compare the values of two functions @xmath1 and @xmath113 that live on different domains , ( so that we are able to define a criterion for convergence ) , we can lift paths in @xmath26 , such that the begin point of the lift is in both situations @xmath2 .",
    "the difference in value of @xmath1 and @xmath113 on the lift of a suitable path @xmath577 , serves as a measure for how close the two functions are on that particular path . of course , to give this whole formulation a solid foundation , will require a lot more work , which we leave outside the scope of this thesis .",
    "after all this discussion , there is at least one question which still is nt answered yet : what is an approximation system ?",
    "the different examples may of course have given an impression of what is meant with it , but a strict definition has not been given .",
    "as one may have noticed , the expansions and projections take various forms , which are difficult to capture all in a single definition . restricting ourselves to the formulation with germs ,",
    "approximation systems may be informally described as expansion systems on spaces of holomorphic germs , for which each expansion is a transformation which ( possibly ) erases some of the information of the lower order derivatives ( i.e. an initial part of the taylor series ) , and for which the projections are the containers of this information .",
    "a further smoothness condition on the expansions and projections may be desirable , in order to have convergence of the as .",
    "of course , this description of as s is still to vague to be used within a mathematical context , but hopefully it does give an idea of the mechanism behind as s .",
    "it is clear that approximation systems open the door to a virtually endless number of expansions .",
    "and then we havent even mentioned yet the case in which we do not involve any differentiations in our maps @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , if we replace the differential operator in example [ ex app sys 1 ] and example [ ex app sys 2 ] by the operation @xmath584 , as introduced in example [ ex app sys 3 ] , then a whole new family of identities arises , such as : @xmath585 where @xmath586 denotes the lambert @xmath587 function . in the literature",
    ", the first two kinds of expansions are respectively referred to as _ infinite exponentials _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and _ nested radicals _",
    "the third type of expansion is again a _ continued fraction _ , but different from example [ ex cont frac ] , now including a variable @xmath462 . for arbitrary analytic functions ,",
