    "the mass - metallicity relation evolves toward lower metallicity at higher redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , roughly commensurate with the increased gas fractions measured for modest samples @xcite .",
    "although progress towards quantifying the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time is seemingly impressive , essentially all of the data - driven results described above rely on indirect estimates of metallicity and should be regarded with due skepticism .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we caution that these methods are still sensitive to assumptions such as the electron energy distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this presents an observational challenge in that temperature - sensitive and recombination lines of heavy elements are fainter than the balmer recombination lines of hydrogen by factors of @xmath8100 and @xmath81000 , respectively .",
    "this has motivated the development of more practical  although more uncertain  methods based on the flux ratios of balmer lines and comparably bright collisionally excited metal lines . these  strong line \" methods , first introduced by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "exploit the fact that various flux ratios are strongly correlated with direct measurements of metallicity .",

    ", however , there is no clear consensus on the absolute metallicity scale : different published calibrations differ by up to 0.7 dex @xcite ! nonetheless these discrepancies have not curtailed efforts to quantify _ relative _ metallicity evolution of galaxies up to redshifts @xmath10 using consistent sets of calibrations .",
    "another concern is whether strong line methods can be reliably applied at high redshifts at all , given that existing calibrations are based entirely on local galaxies and h  ii  regions .",
    "if the physical state of h  ii  regions evolves systematically with redshift , this will induce artificial evolutionary trends in metallicities inferred from locally - calibrated diagnostics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "other diagrams involving only oxygen , hydrogen , and sulfur lines do not show significant offsets , however .",
    "since [ n  ii]/h@xmath6  and o3n2  @xmath13  ( [ o  iii]/h@xmath5)/([n  ii]/ha ) are among the most commonly used strong - line metallicity indicators at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "several possible causes for this evolution have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and there is some evidence that elevated electron density may be at least partially responsible @xcite . increased stellar effective temperatures can also explain the evolution ( as considered in detail by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this should result in similar offsets in [ s  ii]/h@xmath6  versus [ o  iii]/h@xmath5 , which are not observed @xcite . in some cases the offsets are explained by a combination of star formation and agn excitation @xcite .",
    "integral field spectroscopic observations of lensed galaxies show that these offsets are present even for individual giant h  ii  regions @xcite . at the very least it is clear that metallicities inferred from these diagnostics are not consistent with local samples nor even internally among high redshift samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our study is motivated primarily by measurements of strong evolution in the bpt line ratio diagram and the associated unknown astrophysics .",

    "the primary purpose of this paper is to present a set of strong - line metallicity diagnostics that can be accurately used at high redshifts .",
    "ultimately the diagnostics given in table  [ tab : diagnostics ] and figure  [ fig : offset ] are calibrated from local data since we find that data at @xmath0 give fully consistent results but with larger uncertainty . while this study is limited to @xmath125 , galaxies at @xmath12 show no offset in the line ratios considered here ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite regarding [ ne  iii ] ) .",
    "we therefore consider it likely that these diagnostics are accurate up to @xmath113 and perhaps even at all redshifts , although this has yet to be confirmed with direct t@xmath26-based measurements .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the diagnostics in table  [ tab : diagnostics ] are only valid for the range of line ratios and metallicities probed by this work ( @xmath76  @xmath1268.4 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : bpt ] suggests that mild extrapolation may yield reasonable results but we do not endorse this .    a broader consequence of the non - evolution in strong - line metallicity diagnostics ( those in table  [ tab : diagnostics ] and",
    "figure  [ fig : offset ] at least ) is that _ any _ local calibration can be used to infer self - consistent metallicity evolution from high redshift data .",
    "a variety of such calibrations exist in the literature based on different methods including the  direct \" t@xmath26  method , photoionization models , and recombination lines . different methods are well known to give discrepant results ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and hence the true absolute metallicity scale remains under debate .",
    "even the calibrations presented here are subject to systematic variation by up to 0.05 dex in metallicity depending on the adopted atomic parameters and t@xmath26([o  ii])t@xmath26([o  iii ] ) relation .",
    "however , the t@xmath26-based analysis in this work demonstrates clearly that metallicity does not evolve at fixed strong line ratios , at least for the hydrogen and @xmath6-element lines considered here .",
    "we advocate using multiple diagnostics simultaneously to infer metallicity from strong - line methods .",
    "it is clear from figures  [ fig : offset ] and [ fig : bpt ] that the usefulness of various diagnostics is a strong function of their position along the locus of line ratios ( i.e. , metallicity ) .",
    "for example , o@xmath127 gives a more precise constraint on metallicity than r@xmath118 in the regime where o@xmath128 ( @xmath76  @xmath129 ) , while r@xmath118 is the more precise indicator at higher metallicities . in any case the precision is clearly improved when using both in combination ( right - most panel of figure  [ fig : bpt ] ) .",
    "the best approach is of course to use _ all _ available diagnostics to infer metallicity , as was done for example in @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* with an excellent illustrative example in figure 6 of that paper ) .",
    "one may also use observed ( reddened ) flux ratios combined with priors such as h@xmath23/h@xmath5  @xmath55 to produce a 2-dimensional probability distribution in both reddening and metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is more robust than adopting a fixed reddening estimate .",
    "we note that while [ ne  iii]/[o  iii ]  is insensitive to metallicity , it provides a valuable constraint and sanity check on the nebular reddening ( figure  [ fig : rv ] ) .",
    "knowledge of the intrinsic scatter is essential for combining multiple diagnostics : the scatter allows for a straightforward calculation of the likelihood of any metallicity and nebular reddening ( i.e. , the posterior probability distribution ) from a given set of emission line ratios , from which the most likely metallicity and confidence intervals can be computed .",
    "it is for this reason that we list the intrinsic scatter in line ratios at fixed metallicity for each of our calibrations in table  [ tab : diagnostics ] .",
    "it is worth considering whether the precision of strong - line metallicity methods can be improved by introducing a second parameter .",
    "for example , photoionization models suggest that the intrinsic scatter in metallicity calibrations can be reduced by fitting for the ionization parameter in addition to metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . typically the idea is to use e.g. r@xmath118 primarily as an indicator of metallicity , with a correction for ionization parameter derived from additional line ratios such as o@xmath127 .",
    "we conducted an empirical test by measuring the correlation between metallicity and offsets in the direction orthogonal to the best - fit loci shown in figure  [ fig : bpt ] .",
    "there is a significant trend in the local comparison sample , in the sense that @xmath130 at constant o@xmath127 .",
    "the error represents formal uncertainty in the best - fit slope and does not reflect the much larger sample variance . while this indicates a statistically significant secondary parameter , its effect is negligible : applying equation  [ eq : offsets ] reduces the intrinsic scatter in inferred metallicity by only 3% compared to using the o@xmath127 calibration alone .",
    "likewise the @xmath131 method of @xcite does not substantially reduce the scatter .",
    "we therefore find no compelling reason at this time to include secondary trends between metallicity and offsets from the line ratio loci in figure  [ fig : bpt ] when calculating metallicity using the strong - line calibrations presented here .      as the first such work at cosmological distances",
    ", our investigation of strong - line metallicity diagnostics at @xmath0 provides helpful guidance for future efforts to undertake a similar study at higher redshifts .",
    "it is imperative to construct a sample which is complete in sensitivity , without regard to emission line detection significance as this induces a bias .",
    "we note that t@xmath26-based metallicities for @xmath132 galaxies reported in the literature ( by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are on average lower than expected from their strong line ratios , although most individual measurements are compatible with the @xmath1 relations given the scatter .",
    "however the existing sample at these redshifts is too small for robust conclusions . for our sample , selecting only the galaxies with @xmath34 detections of [ o  iii]@xmath144363 in figure  [ fig : sample ] would lead us to conclude that metallicity calibrations evolve by @xmath133 dex at fixed [ o  iii]/[o  ii ]  compared to @xmath1 .",
    "even requiring a 5@xmath31 detection would lead to an inferred evolution of @xmath80.1 dex .",
    "a sensitivity such that uncertainty in the ratio of [ o  iii]@xmath144363/[o  iii]@xmath134 is @xmath135 is sufficient for a sample with comparable ( or lower ) metallicity to that used here .",
    "our sample of 32 galaxies yields a precision of 0.03 dex in the evolution of strong - line metallicity diagnostics , and hence even a modest sample of 10 - 15 galaxies would provide a measurement of evolution at the @xmath190.05 dex level .",
    "given the wealth of spectroscopic data now in hand from ground- and space - based surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it may be practical to construct such a sample at @xmath123 with careful pre - selection and moderately deep followup to obtain the requisite sensitivity to [ o  iii]@xmath144363 .",
    "our choice of [ o  iii]/h@xmath5  as the abscissa in figure  [ fig : nt ] is motivated by the strong observed redshift evolution in either [ o  iii]/h@xmath5  or / and [ n  ii]/h@xmath6  ( the classic bpt diagram ) .",

    "<S> o , ne , and h line ratios follow the same locus at @xmath0 as at @xmath1 with @xmath40.02 dex evolution and low scatter ( @xmath40.04 dex ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests little or no evolution in physical conditions of h  ii  regions at fixed oxygen abundance , in contrast to models which invoke more extreme properties at high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that offsets observed in the [ n  ii]/ha  versus [ o  iii]/h@xmath5  diagram at high redshift are therefore due to [ n  ii ]  emission , likely as a result of relatively high n / o abundance . </S>",
    "<S> if this is indeed the case , then nitrogen - based metallicity diagnostics suffer from systematic errors at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> our findings indicate that locally calibrated abundance diagnostics based on @xmath6-capture elements can be reliably applied at @xmath7 and possibly at much higher redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes the first firm basis for the widespread use of empirical calibrations in high redshift metallicity studies . </S>"
