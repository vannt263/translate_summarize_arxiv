    "disk galaxies are gas - rich systems , with a multi - phase , highly structured interstellar medium ( ism ) . within the ism ,",
    "star formation takes place in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , sometimes concentrated in spiral arms .",
    "the rate and character of star formation are influenced by physical processes from sub - pc to multi - kpc scales . in spite of the complexity of the ism and star formation at small scales",
    ", there are nevertheless clear correlations between the large - scale rate at which stars are born , and the properties of the ism and ( intra-)galactic environment on large ( @xmath1 kpc ) scales .",
    "as discussed by frank bigiel at this meeting ( see also @xcite , and references therein ) , in regions of galaxies where the gaseous surface density @xmath2 , the star formation rate closely follows the surface density of molecular gas .",
    "this can be understood in terms of having an essentially constant star formation timescale , @xmath3 , within molecular gas ( which is observed to be in organized in gravitationally bound clouds with properties that are similar in different galaxies ) . as a consequence , @xmath4 in regions where the molecular gas dominates the atomic gas . for regions where atomic gas dominates ( primarily in the outer parts of galaxies )",
    ", @xmath5 instead varies as a steeper power of @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to this superlinear behavior , there is considerable scatter in the relation between @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 at low surface density , suggesting that one or more other parameters , in addition to @xmath6 , controls the star formation rate .    indeed , recent examination of the correlation of @xmath5 with `` non - interstellar '' galactic environmental properties has revealed interesting dependences , indicating that in the outer parts of galaxies , both the specific star formation rate and the ratio of molecular - to - atomic gas increase roughly linearly with the _ stellar _ surface density @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "previously , @xcite found an approximately linear increase of the molecular content with the estimated dynamic pressure of the ism , and this is evident in the sample analyzed by @xcite as well .",
    "the physical reason for the relationship between molecular content ( and star formation ) and pressure has not , however , been clear from these empirical studies .    observations of star formation pose a number of challenges : why is there an increase in the slope of @xmath8 in going from molecular- to atomic - dominated regions ?",
    "what is the physical reason for the empirical relation between ism pressure and star formation ; more generally , how do galactic parameters such as @xmath7 , the velocity dispersions of stars and of gas , and spiral structure affect @xmath5 ?",
    "is it possible to explain the observed behavior of @xmath5 using simplified theoretical models , and what is required in numerical simulations in order to reproduce observed star formation relationships ?",
    "recent theoretical work has taken on these challenges with increasing success ; a key to these advances has been a more sophisticated treatment of both the ism and the galactic environment .",
    "for example , @xcite found , using numerical simulations of the ism and a cooling function allowing multiple phases , star formation rates and proportions between self - gravitating and diffuse gas similar to the observations of @xcite and @xcite provided that turbulent driving is included ; for non - turbulent models , the proportion of self - gravitating gas was found to be much too high .",
    "motivated by recent observations as well as simulations and earlier theory , @xcite ( hereafter oml ) have developed a simple model for star formation regulation in multiphase , turbulent ism disks .",
    "in essence , the oml model combines three basic principles : ( 1 ) the diffuse ( atomic ) component of the ism is in approximate thermal equilibrium , with a density ( and pressure ) proportional to the heating rate ; ( 2 ) the diffuse component of the ism is in approximate dynamical equilibrium , with the pressure at any height above the galactic midplane given by the weight of the overlying gas ; ( 3 ) uv from young stars provides most of the heating for the atomic component of the ism , with star formation taking place only within the gravitationally - bound component of the ism .",
    "these principles have been individually established and extensively studied ( over several decades ) in the astrophysical literature .",
    "@xcite combined ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to conclude that the diffuse atomic gas in the local milky way must consist of a two - phase cloud / intercloud medium . in this and",
    "subsequent treatments of thermal and dynamical equilibrium , the heating rate has generally been treated as an independent ( empirical ) parameter .",
    "but , by including ( 3 ) together with ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , oml obtained a closed system representing a local patch of a disk galaxy .",
    "for this closed system , the partition of gas into phases and the star formation rate are obtained self - consistently .    in the oml model ,",
    "the ( simplified ) ism is treated as having two components , one consisting of diffuse gas ( including both high - density cold atomic cloudlets and a low - density warm atomic intercloud medium ) , and the other consisting of gravitationally - bound clouds ( gbcs ) .",
    "although hot gas is also present in the ism , it is a tiny fraction of the mass , and fills @xmath9 of the volume @xcite ( oml describe how to correct for this effect ) . for galaxies with normal metallicity , the gbcs would represent giant molecular clouds , including their atomic shielding layers .",
    "averaged over @xmath0 scales ( which may contain many or few individual gbcs ) , the total surface density of the gbc component is @xmath10 , and the total surface density of the diffuse component is @xmath11 .",
    "the diffuse component is assumed to be in vertical dynamical equilibrium ( as has been verified by numerical simulations ; e.g. @xcite ) , with the vertical gravity ( from the diffuse gas , the gbc component , the stellar disk , and the dark matter halo ) balanced by the difference between midplane and external values of thermal pressure @xmath12 , turbulent pressure @xmath13 , and magnetic stresses @xmath14 .",
    "because cooling times are short compared to other timescales , the diffuse gas is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium , with the additional provision that both warm and cold phases are present .",
    "this allows a range of pressures between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; for the model of oml , it is assumed that the pressure is equal to the geometric mean of these limits , @xmath17 . for atomic gas , heating",
    "is generally dominated by the uv and cooling by collisionally - excited lines @xcite , which yields @xmath18 .",
    "( note that other heating  e.g. cosmic rays and shocks  can be more important for very dense , shielded cores and very hot gas , respectively . )",
    "finally , the oml model assumes that the rate of star formation is proportional to the total surface density @xmath10 of gas in the gbc component , @xmath19 .",
    "vertical dynamical equilibrium within the diffuse layer is expressed as @xmath20 , where the mean vertical gravity is @xmath21 @xmath22 is the midplane density of stars plus dark matter , @xmath23 is the total vertical velocity dispersion of the diffuse gas , and the total pressure is larger than the thermal pressure by a factor @xmath24 ( see below ) .",
    "the gbc component contributes more strongly ( per unit mass ) to the gravity because its scale height is smaller than that of the diffuse gas .",
    "if @xmath25 is the cooling rate per unit volume and @xmath26 is the heating rate per unit volume , then the two - phase pressure is given by @xmath27^{1/2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the equilibrium condition @xmath28 for both phases .",
    "cooling of the cold atomic medium is dominated by metals ( in particular , c ii ) so that @xmath29 , while heating is dominated by the photoelectric effect with @xmath30 ; since @xmath31 and @xmath32 are relatively independent of the heating rate @xcite , this yields @xmath33 if @xmath34 .",
    "the terms @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the ratios of metals and dust to hydrogen , respectively .",
    "the mean uv intensity is affected by radiative transfer through the diffuse gas , but for modest optical depth in the diffuse gas the relation @xmath37 is expected to hold .",
    "in addition , a larger fraction of the uv escapes from gbcs if @xmath38 is very sub - solar , which increases @xmath39 for a given @xmath5 ( this effect is quite uncertain , but might increase @xmath39 by a factor @xmath40 ) . in thermal equilibrium with @xmath41 , the midplane pressure is therefore expected to vary roughly as @xmath42 , with a somewhat larger coefficient for very low - metallicity regions .    combining the thermal equilibrium relation @xmath43 ( normalized using the solar neighborhood thermal pressure @xmath44 and star formation rate @xmath45 ) with the dynamical equilibrium relation @xmath46 and the star formation relation @xmath47 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath48 here , @xmath49 ; for fiducial parameters , this acceleration is @xmath50 .",
    "it is interesting to compare outer and inner disks . in outer disks ( similar to the solar neighborhood and beyond , in galaxies like the milky - way )",
    ", diffuse gas dominates the total so that @xmath51 ; in addition , the term depending on @xmath22 dominates the gravity @xmath52 . in this regime , the relation @xmath53",
    "is therefore expected to hold .",
    "physically , this regime may be thought of as the result of star formation increasing until the heating it provides is sufficient to balance cooling at the ( dynamically - imposed ) midplane pressure .",
    "if there is too little gas in the gbc component , the star formation rate would be extremely low , and the uv field would be very weak . a very low heating rate could not maintain a warm medium at the pressure imposed by the local gravitational field , so that ( a portion of the ) warm gas would condense out and become cold clouds .",
    "these cold clouds would collect to create more gbcs , which would then initiate star formation , raising the local uv radiation field until heating balances cooling .",
    "given the low gravity and pressure of outer disks , cooling rates are moderate , and relatively low levels of star formation are needed to produce enough uv that heating balances cooling .    for outer disks where the stars and dark matter dominate gravity , the vertical oscillation time is @xmath54 ; a dense cloud settles to the midplane in @xmath55 . in this regime , the conversion time from gas to stars , @xmath56 , is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean thermal dispersion in the diffuse medium ( here @xmath59 is the thermal speed in the warm ism ) . using @xmath60 and defining a star formation energy conversion efficiency @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 that is , the gas conversion time ( or depletion time )",
    "is set by the time for gas to settle to the midplane , scaled by factors for the ratio of gas - to - radiation pressure in the solar neighborhood , the mass - to - energy conversion efficiency , and @xmath64 .    in inner disks , unlike outer disks , we have @xmath65 , so that @xmath4 . in inner disks , it is straightforward to show that there is an upper limit on the diffuse gas surface density @xmath11 .",
    "physically , the reason for this limit is that the diffuse - gas cooling rate per particle increases with higher density and pressure in the inner parts of disks at least as @xmath66 ( since @xmath67/\\sigma_z^2 $ ] ) , whereas the heating rate per particle varies as @xmath68 . thus , cooling will exceed heating ( causing mass to drop out of the diffuse component ) unless @xmath11 is sufficiently low .",
    "enhanced cooling and mass `` dropout '' is likely responsible at least in part for the `` saturation '' of hi surface densities at @xmath69 that has been observed in the inner parts of galaxies @xcite .    based on the relations described above",
    ", the star formation law is expected to steepen from @xmath4 in inner disks to @xmath70 in outer disks .",
    "a reduction of the specific star formation rate @xmath71 is indeed observed in galaxies starting at @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "for some galaxies , a further power - law relation @xmath73 may hold such that @xmath8 in outer disks , but this need not be the case in general  that is , integrated `` schmidt''-type relations need not hold .    in oml , the full solution for @xmath5 is obtained as a function of @xmath6 , @xmath22 , and the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 , under the assumptions of thermal and dynamical equilibrium described above .",
    "it is also shown that the theoretical solution for @xmath5 agrees well overall with a sample of disk galaxies analyzed in @xcite , with especially close correspondence for the large flocculent galaxies ngc 7331 and ngc 5055 .",
    "figure 1 shows an example of the comparison between the model and data , for ngc 5055 .",
    "given the promising comparisons between the analytic theory and observations , it will be quite interesting to develop numerical simulations that fully test the assumptions and results of the thermal / dynamical equilibrium model .",
    "encouragingly , the poster presented by c .- g .",
    "kim at this meeting shows that initial numerical tests support the assumptions of thermal and dynamical equilibrium adopted in the analysis of oml .",
    "as discussed above , the oml theory contains parameters that must be set from either observations or detailed simulations . in the remainder of this contribution , we review what is known in this regard based on previous numerical work , and what measurements will be needed from future modeling efforts .",
    "from equations ( [ gz - eq ] ) and ( [ ratio - eq ] ) , the star formation rate in outer - disk regions is expected to vary as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 , with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 the ( mass - weighted ) mean thermal , turbulent , and alfvn speeds in the diffuse gas ( we now omit angle brackets denoting averaging ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath82 can also be written as @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the star formation rate is expected to depend on the total velocity dispersion @xmath23 ( or the ratio @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is fixed by atomic physics ) , and on the fraction of diffuse gas in the warm phase @xmath86    the ratios @xmath84 and @xmath87 depend on the details of gas dynamics in the diffuse ism .",
    "important effects include warm and cold phase exchange via thermal instability ; turbulence ( with the associated shock heating and adiabatic temperature changes , as well as turbulent mixing ) ; conversion of diffuse gas to gbcs via midplane settling , self - gravity , and turbulence - induced cloudlet collisions ; return of gbc gas to the diffuse phase by photodissociation and by `` mechanical '' destruction processes ( including expanding hii regions , winds , sne , and radiation pressure ) .",
    "turbulence in the diffuse gas can be driven by stellar energetic inputs as well as spiral shocks , the magnetorotational instability , large - scale gravitational instabilities in the disk , and cosmic infall .",
    "numerical studies to understand the various effects involved are very much a work in progress , but some consensus is already beginning to emerge on a number of points :    * for a medium with a bistable cooling curve , the midplane thermal pressure tends to evolve , by exchange of mass between cold and warm components of the diffuse phase , such that the mean value is comparable to , or slightly below , @xmath88 @xcite . since out - of equilibrium effects",
    "depend on the heating time from shocks compared to the cooling time , the mean value of the thermal pressure , as well as the breadth of the pressure distribution , must in general be affected by the scale and the amplitude of turbulence ( see ) .",
    "realistic numerical evaluations of the mean thermal pressure ( for a given radiative heating rate ) therefore will require numerical simulations in which the vertical box size is comparable to the true scale height of the diffuse ism , and in which the turbulent amplitude is @xmath89 .",
    "* magnetic fields in differentially - rotating multiphase disks are amplified by the magnetorotational instability until the magnetic pressure becomes comparable to the thermal gas pressure , with @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "supernova - driven turbulence also contributes to amplifying the magnetic field . * the energy input from supernovae yield ism velocity dispersions @xmath91 for models with a wide range of supernova driving rates and disk properties ( e.g. ) .",
    "these values are comparable to those observed in the hi gas .",
    "simulations have also shown that the turbulent amplitudes decrease at smaller scales and for higher densities . with this range of turbulent velocity dispersions ,",
    "the turbulent pressure in simulations of the diffuse ism is comparable to the thermal pressure . *",
    "the interaction between self - gravity and rotational shear also drives turbulence at significant levels ( @xmath92 ) in galactic disks @xcite .",
    "however , the turbulent power is much larger at the large ( @xmath0 ) scales that dominate the swing amplifier than at scales below the disk scale height , and in - plane velocities ( which do not contribute to vertical support of the disk ) are much larger than vertical velocities .",
    "thus , turbulence driven by instabilities on large scales is likely of limited importance in regulating the effective midplane pressure ( for a given local gas surface density @xmath6 ) , and hence the star formation rate .",
    "( gravitational instabilities would , however , enhance @xmath6 and thus @xmath5 locally . )",
    "flapping associated with non - steady spiral shocks also drives turbulence in the diffuse ism @xcite , but again , vertical motions are small compared to horizontal motions .",
    "although numerical results have shown that the total turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath23 is relatively insensitive to the disk properties and the supernova driving rate ( consistent with observations ) , it is much less certain how the warm fraction , or @xmath93 , depends on disk conditions and/or the star formation rate . assessing this dependence , including a full exploration of parameter space , is an important task for future numerical studies .",
    "the fraction of diffuse atomic gas in different phases is not well known empirically , either , although observations of c ii with _ herschel _ potentially afford a means to separate cold and warm components of the atomic medium ( which both contribute to 21 cm emission ) .",
    "finally , it remains important to understand more fully how spiral structure develops , and in particular , whether it is possible to characterize in a simple way the fraction of gas in a given annulus that is found in `` arm '' vs. `` interarm '' conditions , and what the compression factor is for the gas surface density .",
    "numerical simulations have begun to marry spiral structure with an increasingly realistic treatment of the ism ( including multiple phases , turbulence , and magnetic fields ) ; much more , however , remains to be done on this front .",
    "it also remains to be determined how well models like that of oml apply locally for galaxies with strong spiral structure .",
    "more generally , it is important to assess which equilibria ( thermal , dynamical , star formation ) still apply locally even in galaxies with large - scale transient structure in the ism ( due to spiral arms , tidal interactions , mergers , cosmic inflows , etc . ) .",
    "gas is the raw material for star formation , but the detailed state of the ism , which depends in turn on the internal galactic environment , determines the rate at which this material is processed to create new stars .",
    "recent observations have begun to explore the correlation between gas content and star formation at increasingly high spatial resolution , revealing changes in star formation `` laws '' between inner and outer disks ; other environmental dependences of star formation have also been explored , including intriguing correlations between molecular and stellar content of galactic disks .    although the simplest recipes for star formation ( such as a rate that depends inversely on the free - fall time at the mean ism density ) have difficulty matching the data , models that account for feedback and the multiphase character of the ism are more successful . in particular , recent work suggests that the empirical correlation between molecular content and estimated midplane pressure can be understood as reflecting a state of simultaneous thermal and dynamical equilibrium in the diffuse ism .",
    "the thermal / dynamical equilibrium model of oml develops the idea that uv from ob stars provides a feedback loop that regulates the star formation rate : the proportions of diffuse and self - gravitating gas adjust themselves so that the heating rate ( proportional to the mass of self - gravitating gas ) matches the cooling rate ( proportional to the mass of diffuse gas and to the vertical gravitational field ) .",
    "the model formulated in oml is promising in terms of explaining star - forming behavior in observed systems . with numerical simulations",
    ", it will be possible to appraise  and potentially revise  the simplifying assumptions and parameterizations adopted by this equilibrium model .",
    "time - dependent simulations will also lead to a much clearer understanding of how gbcs form and disperse , and how their properties and the formation / destruction timescales relate to galactic environment .",
    "this will aid in defining limits for applying equilibrium relations , while also pointing the way towards non - equilibrium theories of star formation ."
