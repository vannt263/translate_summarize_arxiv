    "about fifteen years ago george bertsch proposed the following problem @xcite : what would be the ground state properties of a many - body system composed of spin-@xmath1 fermions interacting via a short - range contact interaction with an infinitely large scattering length ?    the two - body scattering amplitude can be written as @xmath2 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] and at low energies , @xmath3 can be described by the effective range expansion @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the scattering length and @xmath6 is the effective range .",
    "the unitary limit corresponds to @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this limit , @xmath9 and the scattering amplitude",
    "is then reduced to @xmath10 and thus the cross section in the @xmath11-wave saturates the unitarity bound @xmath12 .",
    "therefore the two - body scattering amplitude becomes completely scale invariant and as a consequence the energy per particle for the ground state of such a system would be given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy per particle of the free ( non - interacting ) fermi gas and @xmath15 has been called bertsch parameter .",
    "in fact , bertsch wanted to know the sign of @xmath15 . if @xmath16 , the system is a gas with positive pressure , and if @xmath17 the system collapses since the pressure is negative .",
    "interesting many - body physics emerges when the interaction is close to the unitarity limit .",
    "in particular , many - body fermionic systems behave almost like a perfect fluid and may exhibit both bcs crossover and bose - einstein condensation which are , in fact , distinct limits of a common phenomenon . if the scattering length is small and negative",
    ", the interaction is weakly attractive and the system is in the bcs limit and there are overlapping loosely bound pairs .",
    "if the scattering length is large and negative , the interaction is strongly attractive and the system is in the bec limit where the fermions form deeply bound pairs @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    both neutron matter at low densities and ultra - cold atoms close to a feshbach resonance are strongly interacting fermionic systems and present large pairing gaps when measured in units of the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations of a superfluid fermi gas with an attractive short - range two - body interaction in the unitary limit ( infinite scattering length and zero effective range ) estimate the energy per particle of neutron matter in 44% of the energy of the free fermi gas and the pairing gap to be about twice the energy per particle @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11-wave interaction between two neutrons is very attractive ( almost enough to produce a @xmath18 bound state ) and has a significantly large ( and negative ) scattering length , @xmath19 .",
    "hence , neutron matter at low densities is a system with features close to the unitary limit .",
    "another reason to study neutron matter at low densities is that both superconductivity and superfluidity in fermonic systems are manifestations of quantum coherence at a macroscopic level .",
    "an _ ab initio _ calculation of a fermi gas in the unitary limit shows that , at @xmath20 , the viscosity is close to the lower limit for a perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "in this work we want to study neutron matter at the unitary limit with on - shell interactions obtained by evolving the nuclear force with the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) towards the infrared region of the similarity cutoff @xmath21 .",
    "the srg has been widely applied to nuclear structure calculations and the nuclear many - body problem @xcite .",
    "the technique is based on a flow equation which for the nucleon - nucleon interaction and the wilson generator reads @xmath22 where the flow parameter @xmath23 is usually written in terms of the so - called similarity cutoff @xmath21 ( which has dimension of momentum ) as @xmath24 .",
    "the potential before evolution ( initial ) corresponds to @xmath25 or @xmath26 and the matrix elements of the evolved potential are denoted as @xmath27 .",
    "the unitarity of the transformation ensures that all observables computed with @xmath27 are exactly the same as the observables computed with the non - evolved initial potential @xmath28 .",
    "this applies in particular to phase - shifts , which do not depend on @xmath21 .",
    "recently , we have developed techniques in nuclear physics in order to study the infrared fixed - point of the srg by pushing the evolution towards the on - shell limit @xmath29  @xcite and have found an elegant an simple way to determine phase shifts from fully diagonal interactions in momentum space complying with isospectrality and levinson s theorem @xcite",
    ".    a simple @xmath11-wave gaussian separable potential toy model allows to carry studies with a moderate numerical effort @xmath30 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 are obtained by fitting the scattering length and the effective range .",
    "the @xmath18 interaction can not be measured directly , but since the @xmath18 and @xmath33 interaction in the @xmath34 channel have similar ( and large ) scattering lengths , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we use the @xmath33 phase - shifts to access how well the toy model describes the nuclear force in the @xmath11-waves .",
    "this gives @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    at similarity cutoffs close to @xmath39",
    "the flow equation becomes extremely stiff so that it is nearly impossible to study the infrared limit of the similarity cutoff , @xmath40 , if the potential has a long tail in momentum space , which is the case for high precision nucleon - nucleon potentials .",
    "this is the reason why we have constructed the toy model since it gives good qualitative results for the nucleon - nucleon @xmath11-waves but has a short tail in momentum space , allowing the srg evolution towards the infrared region of the similarity cutoff with a moderate numerical effort .",
    "the fully diagonal on - shell interaction at @xmath41 is obtained by using the energy shift prescription of ref .",
    "here we apply the toy model to compute the bertsch parameter in the infrared region of the similarity cutoff with different grid sizes .",
    "we also compute the bertsch parameter with high precision nucleon - nucleon potentials to compare them to the results from the toy potential .",
    "the bertsch parameter is the ratio between the total energy of a system of interacting fermions in the unitary limit and the energy of a free fermi gas : @xmath42 the kinetic energy in neutron matter is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the neutron mass and @xmath45 is the fermi momentum .",
    "the potential energy can be obtained in the hartree - fock approximation and is due to the toy interaction in the @xmath34 channel : @xmath46 for realistic high precision interactions , there are also contributions from higher partial waves and the energy per particle can be written as @xmath47 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are linear combinations of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 waves , which are given explicitly in ref .",
    "in fig . [ fig2 ] we show the bertsch parameter as a function of the fermi momentum computed with the toy model for several values of the similarity cutoff , mostly in the infrared region , for different number of grid points . for similarity cutoffs from infinity down to @xmath52 the number of grid points",
    "almost do not affect the results .",
    "however , for smaller values of @xmath21 the number of grid points start to change the results and in the limit @xmath41 the difference is huge as can be seen in the last panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    at @xmath53",
    "the results obtained with the toy model are very close to the results that come out if we consider only @xmath11-waves from high precision nucleon - nucleon potentials .",
    "this can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where we display the bertsch parameter computed with argonne v18 @xcite , nijmegen ii @xcite , n3lo ( 2003 ) @xcite and n3lo ( 2005 ) @xcite nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the minimum value of the bertsch parameter lies in between @xmath54 and @xmath55 for both the toy model and high precision potentials at @xmath45 between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "sophisticated quantum monte carlo calculations give @xmath58 @xcite , so it is quite impressive that a simple separable potential can provide results that are so close to more accurate approaches .    while the contribution from the @xmath11-waves is rather independent of the nucleon - nucleon potential , when higher partial waves are included the results depend on whether one uses phenomenological potentials ( av18 or nijii ) or chiral potentials ( 2003 n3lo or 2005 n3lo ) .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where the bertsch parameter is computed summing up to @xmath59-waves . also , the minimum of @xmath15 gets much smaller and is displaced towards larger @xmath45 .",
    "when the similarity cutoff reaches the limit @xmath41 the interaction becomes fully diagonal and all off - shell ambiguities are then eliminated . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show a comparison of the bertsch parameter at @xmath41 for the toy model and the high precision potentials with only @xmath11-waves ( left panel ) and summing up to @xmath59-waves ( right panel ) . in the region @xmath60 ,",
    "the toy model matches the calculation with high precision potentials with only @xmath11-waves . for larger @xmath45 the result",
    "is also very reasonable if one considers the extreme simplicity of the separable potential .",
    "the @xmath21-dependence of the bertsch parameter is rather strong and shows that it is not determined just by two - body scattering information unless the extreme on - shell limit @xmath61 is taken .",
    "of course , the real limit @xmath62 and @xmath63 remains an interesting challenge .",
