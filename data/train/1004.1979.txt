    "can be interpreted as a fibrewise connected double covering @xmath10 by another @xmath11-bundle @xmath12 over  @xmath2 .",
    "it is this last definition which most easily generalises to 2-dimensional orbifolds and coverings of higher order .",
    "this is not just generalisation for generalisation s sake .",
    "for instance , such objects appear in the work of witten  @xcite on matrix models of @xmath1-dimensional quantum gravity , see also  @xcite . here",
    "the viewpoint is that of algebraic geometry , where an @xmath3 root of the tangent bundle of a riemann surface @xmath2 is considered to be a holomorphic line bundle whose @xmath3 tensor power equals @xmath7 . in that framework ,",
    "questions of moduli have been studied by jarvis  @xcite and others .",
    "our personal motivation for investigating such @xmath3 roots comes from the moduli problem for taut contact circles on @xmath5-manifolds .",
    "these structures were introduced in  @xcite , where we also classified the @xmath5-manifolds which admit such structures . the moduli question was largely settled in  @xcite , but certain details as to the precise geometry of the moduli spaces had been left open .",
    "these details hinge on the classification of @xmath3 roots of the unit tangent bundle of @xmath1-dimensional hyperbolic orbifolds .",
    "here is an outline of the paper . in section  [ section : orbifold ] we present the basics of @xmath1-dimensional hyperbolic orbifolds , mostly to set up notation . in section  [ section : tangent ] we recall the definition of the unit tangent bundle of an orbifold .",
    "roots of such unit tangent bundles are defined in section  [ section : roots ] , where we determine the conditions on @xmath0 ( in terms of the genus and multiplicities of the cone points of the orbifold  @xmath2 ) for @xmath3 roots to exist .",
    "we also set up a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath3 roots and certain homomorphisms on the fundamental group of the unit tangent bundle of  @xmath2 ( theorem  [ thm : existence ] ) . in section",
    "[ section : diffeo ] this is used to investigate the action by the diffeomorphism group of @xmath2 on the set of @xmath3 roots .",
    "the number of orbits under this action is determined ( proposition  [ prop : standard ] ) , as well as the length of the orbits ( proposition  [ prop : number ] ) . in section  [ section :",
    "algebraic ] we reformulate this action by the diffeomorphism group in algebraic terms as an action by the outer automorphism group of the orbifold fundamental group .",
    "finally , in section  [ section : moduli ] we use this algebraic reformulation and the results of the previous sections to describe the teichmller space ( theorem  [ thm : teich ] ) and moduli space ( theorem  [ thm : moduli ] ) of taut contact circles on left - quotients of the @xmath5-dimensional thurston geometry  @xmath6 . in particular , we are interested in the enumeration of the connected components of the moduli space ; this gives the number of distinct taut contact circles up to diffeomorphism and deformation .",
    "sections [ section : orbifold ] to [ section : diffeo ] are completely self - contained .",

    "moreover , it is assumed that @xmath2 is of hyperbolic type , i.e.  its orbifold euler characteristic , defined as @xmath16 is assumed to be negative .",
    "this condition on the orbifold euler characteristic determines those orbifolds which admit a hyperbolic metric ; however , as yet we do not fix such a hyperbolic structure .",
    "the orbifold fundamental group @xmath17 of @xmath2 is defined as the deck transformation group of the universal covering @xmath18 .",
    "we briefly recall the geometric realisation of this group and its standard presentation . to that end , choose a base point @xmath19 distinct from all the cone points , and a lift @xmath20 of @xmath21 in the universal covering space .",

    "we may interpret that figure as a fundamental region in  @xmath24 ; it is determined ( amongst all possible fundamental regions whose boundary polygon maps to the chosen system of curves ) by the indicated placement of @xmath25 on its boundary .",

    "our aim is to classify @xmath3 roots of @xmath4 for @xmath2 an oriented orbifold of hyperbolic type , by which we mean the following .",

    "we now want to give a characterisation of the homomorphisms @xmath84 in terms of the allowable values on the generators in the standard presentation of  @xmath66 . in order to do so",
