    "sixty years ago , it was pointed out by robert dicke that the full quantum mechanical treatment of spontaneous emission from an ensemble of atoms could lead to enhanced , `` superradiant '' emissions in particular modes  @xcite",
    ". such effect would result in the medium spontaneously radiating in a burst much more directional and faster than if the atoms were emitting independently .",
    "this strong cooperativity is originated in the coherent nature of the interaction between atoms and vacuum and in the fact that some vacuum modes are coupled to the whole ensemble . over time , superradiance has attracted great attention , since it may occur at common situations in many different systems and is the manifestation of a macroscopic entangled state spontaneously generated in the medium .",
    "even though , superradiance is still an effect hard to characterize and isolate .",
    "the interaction between particles and the induction of macroscopic polarizations in the sample , for example , may destroy or mask the observations of spontaneous cooperativity  @xcite .",
    "the first observations of strong superradiance , reported in the 1970s using extended ensembles  @xcite , were mixed with strong propagation and diffraction effects  @xcite .",
    "on top of that , there is the question of the necessity or not of the full quantum mechanical treatment , and the entangled states that naturally comes with it , to understand the experimental results .",
    "it is clear that various aspects of superradiance have classical analogues  @xcite , like the enhanced decay in a burst , which can be obtained from an ensemble of antennas emitting in phase .",
    "however , a new process for generating photon pairs from atomic ensembles , proposed in 2001  @xcite and implemented two years later  @xcite , significantly moves away from the semiclassical views of superradiance and reinforces the central role of macroscopic entanglement for the understanding of the phenomenon and of its potential applications .",
    "this process was part of a broad protocol for quantum communication over long distances , known as the duan - lukin - cirac - zoller ( dlcz ) protocol . in the following ,",
    "we highlight the impact the experimental implementation of the dlcz protocol had on the study of superradiance , and report an investigation on the dynamics of such photon - pair generation that directly reveals its superradiant character .",
    "our measurements of acceleration in the radiation process complement the known collective enhancement in directionality in the system . in this way , all key aspects of the phenomenology of superradiance have now been identified in connection to the dlcz photon - pair - generation process , which can be employed henceforth as a framework for the systematic study of superradiance itself .",
    "below , in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we discuss the role of superradiance in the dlcz protocol , as we introduce the basic process behind single - photon generation in our system .",
    "section  [ iii ] presents our experimental setup , its characterization , and our first results related to superradiance . in this section ,",
    "we measure the threshold optical depth of the atomic ensemble for superradiant behavior , as revealed by a sharp growth of the probability to detect the emitted single photon in the correct mode , combined with the appearance of nonclassical correlations in the system .",
    "we also demonstrate that such detection probability grows , at threshold , with the square of the number of atoms in the ensemble .",
    "section  [ iv ] focus on our observations of rabi oscillations for the collective atomic mode and their comparison to an analytical theory for the reading process .",
    "this comparison is the basis to extract the decay time of the excited state modified by the condition of superradiance . in sec .",
    "[ v ] we demonstrate experimentally , then , that such decay time is decreased as the number of atoms in the ensemble grows in the way expected for a superradiance process .",
    "section  [ vi ] provides finally our conclusions and perspectives on the subject .",
    "in order to understand its classical analogy , one may view superradiance as a cascade of emissions starting at a state of maximum energy of an ensemble of two - level atoms  @xcite , see fig .",
    "labeling @xmath0 and @xmath1 the ground and excited states , respectively , the initial state @xmath2 of the ensemble would carry then no coherence between the atoms .",
    "once a first atom spontaneously decays and emits a photon in the common mode , the system is left in a large symmetrical collective state @xmath3 , for which an atom @xmath4 decayed , but it is not known which one .",
    "this large entangled state has a fixed phase between its parts and some coherence , coming from the small probability each atom has of being in the ground state . as the cascade proceeds down the energy ladder ,",
    "new symmetrical states are formed with more and more atoms in @xmath0 .",
    "the amount of coherence then grows in the sample .",
    "after many emissions , the system s behavior is dominated by its large coherence and hereafter may be approximated by its classical analogue . in the end ,",
    "the ensemble is left in state @xmath5 , with again no coherence . in the picture",
    "presented above , which have been quite successful for explaining experimental observations  @xcite , the full quantum mechanical treatment is only required to describe the spontaneous trigger for an otherwise classical decay process .     and @xmath1 .",

    "write and read are large beams counterpropagating to each other .",
    "fields 1,2 are defined by the optical fibers ( in blue ) carrying them to detectors @xmath8,@xmath9 .",

    "three - level atoms in @xmath10 configuration are employed ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , with an extra ground state @xmath7 added to the above picture .",
    "all atoms are initially prepared in @xmath0 .",
    "the sample is then excited by a laser pulse ( _ write _ ) detuned from the transition @xmath11 and , with small probability , a photon may be spontaneously emitted in the transition @xmath12 , with an atom being simultaneously transferred to @xmath7 . if the photon is emitted in a mode ( _ field 1 _ ) common to the ensemble , its detection heralds the preparation of the symmetrical entangled state @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "a second laser pulse ( _ read _ ) may now excite the transition @xmath14 and , with high probability , a second photon ( _ field 2 _ ) is emitted in the transition @xmath15 . in the end , all atoms are left again in @xmath0 .",
    "this last part of the process is the one connected to the usual phenomenology of superradiance , the high probability for the second emission coming from its strong directionality  @xcite . differently from previous experiments in superradiance",
    ", however , a strong read pulse may `` open '' the medium to the outgoing photon , using the effect known as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite , reducing considerably distortions due to propagation of the photon through a thick , extended sample .",
    "after the first implementations of this process  @xcite , a major development was the introduction in 2005 of a four - wave - mixing configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) for the photon pair generation  @xcite , which solved most complications related to diffraction in the superradiant emission .",
    "the write pulse have here a considerably larger waist for its transversal mode than the one for field 1 , which is fiber - coupled and detected with a small angle to the direction of the write beam . in this case",
    ", the stored state with a single excitation in the ensemble would be given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 gives the probability that the @xmath4th atom contributed to the detected mode  @xcite . in this way",
    ", the optical fiber for field 1 defines the spatial shape of the collective state stored in the ensemble .",
    "if the read field has also a large waist and is counterpropagating to the write beam , then field 2 is generated in the conjugated mode to field 1  @xcite .",
    "the result is a superradiant emission of photon 2 in a well defined single mode , which can be coupled to an optical fiber with high efficiency  @xcite .",
    "an indirect observation of the superradiant increase of the spontaneous decay rate of the system was also reported in  @xcite , as part of a detailed study of the saturation and spectrum of the readout process of field 2 under conditions of strong decoherence due to inhomogeneous magnetic fields acting on the atomic ensemble .    the overall process described above amounts then to a minimal superradiant cascade ( fig",
    ".  [ fig1]b ) , in which a single photon is responsible for the preparation of the initial macroscopic entangled state that later results in the superradiant emission of another single photon . the fundamental importance of a minimal , single - photon superradiance have been emphasized in recent years in a number of publications  @xcite , and other experiments at the single - excitation level have been reported in studies of nuclear scattering of synchrotron radiation  @xcite and of two - photon cascade transitions in cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "the essential quantum - mechanical nature of the effect , in this case , can be directly apprehended from the interplay between its wave - like ( collective interference ) and particle - like ( single - photon detection ) aspects .",
    "the dlcz protocol , however , adds to this picture the possibility to generate complex entangled states between different atomic ensembles  @xcite and even to explore these states for practical applications  @xcite .",
    "in our experimental setup , the atomic ensemble is a cloud of cold cesium atoms obtained from a magneto - optical trap , with the trap laser tuned 15  mhz below the @xmath18 ) transition and the repumper laser resonant with the @xmath19 transition .",

    "particularly , we measured the threshold optical depth of the ensemble to start the superradiant process , and demonstrate that the probability to emit the single photon grows with the square of the number of atoms at threshold .",
    "we also measure the decrease of the decay time from the excited state , for single - photon emission , as the number of atoms is increased , following the expected behavior for superradiance .",
    "key to our approach is a close comparison of our experimental data for the photonics wavepacket to an analytical theory for the reading process obtained from first principles  @xcite .",
    "finally , the presented investigation opens the way for a systematic , bottom - up approach to the study of superradiance .",
    "the minimal superradiant cascade implemented up to now may be expanded using quantum - optics techniques of conditional generation of states with a larger number of excitations  @xcite . in this way",
    ", it should be possible to generate superradiant cascades with two or more excitations , controllably moving down the typical de - excitation ladder of macroscopic superradiance .",
