    "models of quasar accretion are currently poorly constrained by observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "accretion discs are much too small for direct imaging , and so other observational methods are required to probe their structure .",
    "gravitational microlensing of multiply imaged quasars is one such technique , uniquely able to probe accretion disc structure on scales @xmath5 cm .",
    "the quasar central engine is thought to consist of an accretion disc surrounding a supermassive black hole .",
    "it is a general feature of accretion disc models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) that longer wavelength radiation is emitted from larger regions in the disc .",
    "accretion discs are thus a perfect target for gravitational microlensing analyses , as the amplitude of fluctuations produced by gravitational microlensing depends strongly on the size of the emission region in the source . in particular , microlensing models predict larger fluctuations at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "considerable effort has been invested in microlensing analyses to constrain the sizes of quasar emission regions ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent efforts have focussed on observations in ( typically ) two wavelength bands , in an effort to better constrain models of quasar accretion .",
    "these analyses frequently make use of the method presented in @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed ten quadruply imaged quasars ( including mg 0414 + 0534 , the quasar studied in this paper ) , and argued qualitatively that optical emission regions must be larger than expected from basic thin - disc models by factors of @xmath6 . this result was supported by @xcite , in which accretion disc sizes were determined for ten lensed quasars , and @xcite , which focussed on x - ray and optical monitoring of pg 1115 + 080 .",
    "@xcite used _",
    "g_- and _ r_-band monitoring of q2237 + 0305 to obtain a spectral slope consistent with the standard thin - disc models .",
    "@xcite also found an accretion disc scale and slope consistent with standard thin disc models , using 13 years of photometric data of the two - image lens he 1104 - 1805 .",
    "the quantitative analyses discussed above rely upon monitoring of microlensing - induced brightness fluctuations over an extended time period .",
    "constraints on the size of the emission region in the source are obtained by producing a large number of simulated microlensing light curves , and searching for fits to the observational data .",
    "these constraints are therefore dependent on the transverse velocity , which can be estimated from the light curve ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in (",
    "* hereafter bww07 ) we demonstrated an alternative technique for placing constraints on the size of quasar emission regions using single observations of lensed quasars displaying a flux ratio anomaly .",
    "several gravitationally lensed quasars are observed to contain a pair of images straddling a critical curve .",
    "basic lensing theory predicts that these images should have the same magnification .",
    "however in several cases , one image is observed to be significantly demagnified relative to the other ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has been argued that microlensing by a combination of smooth and clumpy matter in the lensing galaxy is the most likely explanation for this discrepancy @xcite .    by exploring microlensing simulations with varying source size and smooth matter content in the lens ,",
    "we have previously obtained a 95 per cent upper limit on the size of the _ i_-band emission region in the anomalous lensed quasar mg 0414 + 0534 of @xmath7 cm ( bww07 ) . as with all lengths measured from microlensing simulations ,",
    "this size is normalised to the einstein radius , which is scaled by the square root of the microlens mass @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our analysis across multiple filters .",
    "images of mg 0414 + 0534 in the @xmath2 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 filters were obtained on 2007 november 3 , using the magellan 6.5-metre baade telescope .",
    "we also make use of _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) data in the nicmos f110w and f205w filters , taken on 1994 august 14 , and the wfpc2 f675w and f814w filters , taken on 1994 november 8 @xcite .",
    "these data allow us to obtain emission region size constraints in each filter or , equivalently , a power - law fit to the radius of the continuum emission region in the quasar as a function of emitted wavelength .",
    "the observations are described in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we summarise our simulation method , with particular emphasis on how it varies from that presented in bww07 . in section 4",
    "we present the resulting power - law fit to accretion disc radius as a function of emitted wavelength , and discuss our conclusions .    throughout this paper",
    "we use a cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we observed mg 0414 + 0534 using the magellan 6.5-metre baade telescope on 2007 november 3 , in @xmath16 seeing .",
    "observations were made using the imacs ( in f/2 mode ) @xmath2 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 filters and the panic @xmath11 and @xmath12 filters .",
    "integration times were approximately five minutes per filter .",
    "images are provided in figure [ images ] .",
    "we fit gaussians to each quasar image .",
    "we began by assuming a round , gaussian psf , and then allow the ellipticity to vary as a free parameter .",
    "the @xmath12-band image best shows the separation of the lensed images , and this was initially used to constrain the position of each component in each filter . in the final fit we freed up position as well , resulting in a 5-d fit ( x , y , amplitude , fwhm , and ellipticity ) for each component using a downhill gradient technique .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of the four lensed images and the lensing galaxy observed on 2007 november 3 are provided in table [ 0414mags ] .",
    "flux ratios in each filter between the two images of interest , @xmath17 , are provided in table [ 0414obs ] .",
    "this table contains flux ratios from the observations presented in this paper , as well as two sets of _ hst _ observations , obtained from the castles survey web pageand @xcite .",
    "table [ 0414obs ] shows that the flux ratio between images @xmath18 and @xmath19 at any single epoch grows larger as wavelength increases .",
    "we have assumed that this anomaly is solely due to microlensing .",
    "an alternative explanation is differential extinction due to dust in the lens .",
    "it has been argued previously that dust reddening is able to completely explain the anomalous flux ratios in mg 0414 + 0534 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the lens galaxy is a passively evolving early - type galaxy , and thus unlikely to be dust dominated .",
    "furthermore , several lensing systems displaying a flux ratio anomaly similar to mg 0414 + 0534 are known to exist .",
    "microlensing models predict , as is observed , that in such systems it is always the saddle point ( @xmath18 ) image that will be suppressed .",
    "differential extinction due to dust would not be expected to favour one image over another .",
    ".mg 0414 + 0534 magnitudes [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     lensing parameters for images @xmath19 and @xmath18 in mg 0414 + 0534 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then randomly selected source positions in each of the @xmath19 and @xmath18 magnification maps . at each source position , we calculated the magnifications of 40 gaussian sources of increasing characteristic width @xmath0 .",
    "the characteristic width of the sources varied from @xmath20 to @xmath21 in increments of @xmath20 . dividing @xmath19 magnifications by @xmath18 magnifications allowed us to build up a library of 25500 curves of magnification ratio ( equivalently , flux ratio ) as a function of source width , @xmath22 .",
    "we allowed the width of the inner - most ( @xmath2-band ) emission region @xmath23 to vary between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and the power - law index @xmath24 to vary between 0 and 15 .",
    "these values were found to cover the interesting areas of parameter space in coarse simulations .",
    "for each combination of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we calculated emission region widths @xmath25 at the central wavelength of each filter , @xmath26 ( see table [ 0414obs ] ) , using equation [ powerlaw ] .",
    "the value of @xmath27 was taken to be 6231  , the central wavelength of the @xmath2-filter .    by comparing @xmath28 with each of our library of @xmath22 curves ( interpolating linearly in @xmath0 )",
    ", we obtained 25500 values of @xmath29 for each combination of @xmath23 and @xmath24 at each epoch .",
    "these were then compared with @xmath30 , to obtain @xmath31 values , which were converted to likelihoods using :    @xmath32    a final likelihood was obtained for each combination of @xmath23 and @xmath24 at each epoch by summing over the individual likelihoods for each of the 25500 simulated flux ratio curves :    @xmath33    we convert these likelihoods to an a - posteriori differential probability distribution using bayes theorem :    @xmath34    we assume constant bayesian priors for inner width @xmath23 , power - law index @xmath24 and smooth matter percentage @xmath35 .",
    "marginalising over smooth matter percentage , we obtain probability distributions for @xmath23 and @xmath24 at each epoch :    @xmath36    the individual probability distributions are provided in figure [ individual ] .",
    "the left panel shows the magellan imacs and panic distribution , the middle panel shows the _ hst _ nicmos distribution , and the right panel shows the _ hst _ wfpc2 distribution .",
    "the probability distributions at each of the three epochs were then combined to obtain a final distribution for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which is shown in figure [ contours ] ( top panel ) .",

    "bottom left : cumulative probability distribution for the width of the @xmath2-band emission region @xmath23 , in units of the einstein radius @xmath37 .",
    "bottom right : cumulative probability distribution for the power - law index @xmath24.,width=302 ]    figure [ contours ] ( top panel ) shows contours through the probability distribution for the gaussian width of the inner - most ( @xmath2-band ) emission region @xmath23 and power - law index @xmath24 . by marginalising over the power - law index @xmath24 we obtain a 95 per cent upper limit on the width of the @xmath2-band emission region in mg 0414 + 0534 of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 cm in physical units ) .",
    "similarly , we can marginalise over @xmath23 and obtain 95 per cent confidence limits on the power - law index of @xmath4 .",
    "marginalised cumulative probability distributions are provided in figure [ contours ] for @xmath23 ( bottom left panel ) and @xmath24 ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "the smooth matter percentage in this lens is unconstrained .",
    "the standard shakura - sunyaev thin - disc model has @xmath41 ( ignoring the central temperature depression , which is located at scales smaller than smallest width probed in our analysis ) .",
    "this is consistent with our analysis at the 68 per cent confidence level .    using a black hole mass for mg 0414 + 0534 of @xmath42",
    ", obtained using the virial technique with the @xmath43 line @xcite , we can calculate the predicted half - light radius of the @xmath2-band emission region from a shakura - sunyaev thin disc model .",
    "we can compare this theoretical value with our observational results as microlensing fluctuations are sensitive only to the half - light radius of the emission region @xcite .",
    "we assume a 20 per cent accretion efficiency , and an accretion disc inner radius equal to the innermost stable orbit .",
    "we find that the shakura - sunyaev thin disc for mg 0414 + 0534 in the @xmath2 band ( 1712  in the quasar rest frame ) has a half - light radius @xmath44 .",
    "this corresponds to a gaussian source with characteristic width @xmath45 .",
    "this size can be combined with @xmath46 , and is marked as a cross in figure [ contours ] ( top panel ) .",
    "there has been some disagreement between previous microlensing analyses regarding the size of optical emission regions in lensed quasars . @xcite and @xcite both found that quasar optical emission regions are larger than predicted by eddington limited thin disc models .",
    "conversely , @xcite and @xcite found disc sizes consistent with thin disc models .",
    "@xcite noted that the solution to this discrepancy might be a slightly shallower temperature profile than predicted for a shakura - sunyaev thin disc .",
    "our results are consistent with this suggestion .",
    "we note , however , that the only previous analysis of mg 0414 + 0534 @xcite found that it was one of only two lensed quasars in a sample of ten for which a shakura - sunyaev disc was just large enough to explain both the observed x - ray and optical flux ratios .",
    "@xcite also fit a power - law in wavelength to accretion disc radius for the lensed quasar he 1104 - 1805 .",
    "they obtained a power - law index of @xmath47 ( 68 per cent confidence ) . at the 68 per cent confidence level , the power - law index obtained here is @xmath48 .",
    "these results are indistinguishable at the @xmath49 level .",
    "this is particularly interesting as the methods used in the two analyses differ significantly .",
    "@xcite compared 13 years of monitoring data in 11 wavebands to simulated microlensing light curves .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that two images straddling a critical curve each behave differently when microlensed , allowing us to obtain similar results with only 3 epochs of imaging in 10 overlapping wavebands .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated a technique for using near - contemporaneous multi - band imaging of anomalous lensed quasars to constrain the radius of the quasar continuum emission region as a function of emitted wavelength .",
    "the application of this technique to mg 0414 + 0534 yielded an upper limit on the width of the @xmath2-band emission region of @xmath40 cm , and a power - law index range of @xmath4 , both with 95 per cent confidence .",
    "these results are consistent with a shakura - sunyaev accretion disc model .",
    "the greatest strength of our method is its observational efficiency .",
    "previous analyses have relied upon multi - epoch monitoring , with the tightest size constraints typically obtained during the fortuitous observation of high magnification events .",
    "the method demonstrated here requires only as much time as is necessary to obtain sufficient signal to noise of the lensed images in each filter .",
    "however , it is only useful if the lensed quasar is displaying an anomalous flux ratio .",
    "we have assumed this anomalous flux ratio is produced solely by microlensing , although we can not rule out differential extinction due to dust in the lensing galaxy as an alternative explanation .",
    "we have obtained observations of additional systems with anomalous flux ratios , the analysis of which are forthcoming .",
