    "local group dwarf galaxies allow investigation into a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological processes ; in addition to being representative of the most populous type of galaxy in the universe , their nearness enables detailed investigations of their stellar populations ( for a recent overview , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to their low masses and typically old stellar populations ,",
    "many of these dwarfs are believed to have had the majority of their stars produced at early cosmic times and then had further star formation suppressed by reionization at redshifts @xmath1 ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observational arguments in favor of this interpretation for some of the dwarfs have been based on their statistical properties @xcite and star formation histories @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "some of the present - day dwarfs should be similar to their progenitors at higher redshifts .    the advent of optical and infrared space - based telescopes  the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) and the _ spitzer space telescope _  has allowed for the identification of numerous high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) galaxies , whose properties , including their sizes , star formation rates , and masses , have now been examined in detail ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , current observations are missing a population of fainter galaxies that are needed to reionize the universe at these high redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". discovering some of these fainter galaxies will be within the purview of future observatories like the _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) .",
    "part of this population of fainter galaxies is likely to consist of the progenitors of galaxies like the local group dwarfs .",
    "@xcite used an analysis of the uv luminosities of the dwarfs to determine that _ jwst _ should be able to detect progenitors of galaxies like the large magellanic cloud . here",
    ", we compare the physical properties of the local dwarfs and the high - redshift galaxies that have already been detected , and place them in the context of the predicted detection limits for _ jwst _ to examine the fraction of dwarf progenitors  and thus the fraction of missing light  that may be observable in the near future . throughout our discussion , we use the standard cosmological parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 km / s / mpc .",
    "we obtain data for over 100 local galaxies from @xcite , including their @xmath5 band vega magnitude @xmath6 , half - light radius @xmath7 , ellipticity @xmath8 , and average metallicity @xmath9 \\rangle$ ] . to provide direct comparison with the high - redshift data , we convert @xmath10 to the circularized half - light radius , @xmath11 , that is commonly employed .",
    "we select only the 87 galaxies that have all these quantities measured in @xcite , and note in particular that this excludes the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) .",
    "we use metallicity as an input to the flexible stellar population synthesis ( fsps ) code @xcite to scale the galaxies back to @xmath12 . following the results of @xcite , who analyzed the star formation histories ( sfhs ) of a subsample of 38 of these dwarfs ,",
    "we remove those galaxies whose sfhs indicate that the majority of their stellar populations were formed later than these redshifts .",
    "we keep those whose sfhs are consistent with at least @xmath13 ( within errors ) of the stars having been formed prior to @xmath12 , as well as all the remaining galaxies from @xcite whose sfhs have not yet been measured , for a total of 73 galaxies .",
    "we use a delayed tau - model with @xmath14  gyr , which assumes an early starburst such that nearly all the stars we see today already existed at the redshifts of interest .",
    "the code also calculates the evolution to @xmath15 , from which we take the predicted @xmath5 band magnitude and compare it to @xmath6 from @xcite to obtain a correction for the stellar mass of each galaxy ; we then use these values to correct the @xmath16 magnitudes since we assume that all the stars we see today were already present at those high redshifts .    the corresponding parameters for observed @xmath17 and @xmath18 galaxies are obtained from several sources .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "irac 3.6 @xmath19 m fluxes of a sample of @xmath20 galaxies are based on @xcite , and the 4.5 @xmath19 m fluxes of @xmath21 galaxies are taken from @xcite .",
    "we adopt the @xmath22 lower and upper limits on the fluxes , corrected to s / n = 5 , which gives @xmath23 $ ] njy and @xmath24 $ ] njy .",
    "@xcite provides a value of @xmath25 kpc for detected galaxies at these redshifts , measured from near - infrared observations using _",
    "we again adopt the @xmath22 bounds on this quantity ; accordingly , the range of observed sizes that we use is @xmath26 kpc .",
    "the future _ jwst _ mission s nircam imager will have two filters , f356w and f444w , which will cover the bandwidth of the _ spitzer _ filters above .",
    "for the purposes of this comparison , we will assume that the _ spitzer _",
    "3.6 @xmath19 m filter is identical to f356w and the 4.5 @xmath19 m filter is identical to f444w .",
    "we use the fsps - derived fluxes and the sizes @xmath10 to calculate the surface brightness in jy/@xmath27 for the dwarfs at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we selected those galaxies with cumulative sfhs @xmath28 ( within the error profile ) at early times from @xcite and used @xmath29 gyr to scale them , as discussed in section  [ s : data ] , as well as all the remaining galaxies that do not have measured sfhs .",
    "we additionally plot the region bounded by the @xmath22 limits on the surface brightness and half - light radius for galaxies detected at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , using _ spitzer _ 3.6 @xmath19 m and 4.5 @xmath19 m fluxes , respectively .",
    "figure  [ f : size_sb ] shows these regions alongside the scaled galaxies selected from @xcite and the remaining galaxies from @xcite . from this",
    ", we see that virtually none of the local dwarf analogues have been detected yet .        nevertheless , the sizes of the dwarfs and the high redshift galaxies agree extremely well , excluding the extreme smallest and faintest objects . however , we do not include in our comparison a scaling of @xmath10 with redshift .",
    "luminous galaxies at higher redshifts have been observed to have their sizes scaled by a factor of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is in the range of @xmath32 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is some indication , however , that at the lowest luminosities yet studied , the half - light radius remains approximately constant with redshift ( see figure 12 of * ? ? ?",
    "our results are consistent with the notion that the local group galaxies had roughly the same size at high redshifts as they have at present .",
    "_ jwst _ will rely on the nircam imager @xcite to obtain photometry of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we use the prototype exposure time calculator ( etc ) for nircam to compute the signal - to - noise ratio for the dwarf galaxies scaled back to high redshifts .",
    "we assume a total of 100 hours of exposure time ; with such a set - up , the etc predicts that a point source flux of 1.0 njy can be detected in f356w and 2.0 njy in f444w .",
    "we can then calculate the minimum surface brightness for the local galaxy analogues in each band .",
    "we assume that , as is currently done with _",
    "hst_/_spitzer _ observations of high redshift galaxies , the size of the galaxies is measured from bands at shorter wavelengths .",
    "accordingly , in figure  [ f : size_sb ] , we also plot a shaded region bounded by the diffraction - limited radius in the 2.0 @xmath19 m filter at these redshifts and by the surface brightness corresponding to the s / n=5 fluxes calculated by the etc .",
    "we caution , however , that when comparing the sizes care must be taken , as the data for the galaxies uses the half - light radius , whereas the minimum size prediction for _ jwst _ is given by the radius of a high redshift object in the diffraction limit .    from figure  [",
    "f : size_sb ] , we can see that _ jwst _ can be expected to discover some of the local dwarfs if their stars already formed at early cosmic times . in particular , we predict that roughly 60 - 65% of the combined light of the dwarfs will be accessible to _",
    "jwst_. this corresponds to a detection of 9/73 dwarfs at @xmath33 m and 13/73 dwarfs at @xmath34 m , respectively .",
    "this differs from the result of @xcite primarily due to our uniform assumption that these galaxies formed most of their stars at very early times .",
    "if it is the case that significant star formation occurs late in the galaxy s evolution , then there will not be enough light emitted to render the galaxy detectable even by _",
    "jwst_. accordingly , these predicted fluxes will need to be scaled by the fraction of stars formed by @xmath35 once more of the galaxies have their star formation histories analyzed .",
    "our calculated fluxes are predicated upon the assumption that the stellar populations of the @xmath15 dwarfs are the modern analogues of the stars at @xmath36 .",
    "however , these stars may be supplemented by popiii - like stars , which are predicted to have masses in the range @xmath37 and short lifetimes @xcite .",
    "accordingly , in figure  [ f : size_sb_10 ] we consider the scenario in which the dwarf galaxies are 10 times more luminous at high redshifts due to an ancient population of stars that no longer exists .        in this case , we find that some of the dwarf progenitors could be among the galaxies already found with _ hst _ and _ spitzer_. _ jwst _ would observe @xmath38 of the light of the local group dwarfs .",
    "this scenario can be distinguished from the fiducial one based on spectroscopy ; several theoretical works have indicated that such a massive stars would have strong helium line emission , which would distinguish these stellar populations @xcite .",
    "an alternative source of an increase in surface brightness at early times may be provided by tidal stripping .",
    "the simulations of @xcite illustrate the effect of tidal stripping on dwarf galaxies by massive halos .",
    "this effect decreases both the sizes and surface brightnesses of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "if tidal stripping has played a major role in the history of the observed local group , then it is likely that at higher redshifts they were both brighter and larger , which would make the analogues of these galaxies more likely to be detectable .",
    "in addition to the enhanced capabilities of _ jwst _ relative to _ hst _ and _ spitzer _ , we note that further gains in sensitivity can be made using gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "lensing has already permitted the discovery of high redshift galaxies even smaller than the sizes considered here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this technique using _ jwst _ is likely to be able to probe a larger sample of dwarf progenitors .",
    "we have compared the physical properties of local group dwarf galaxies to high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we find that the sizes of the two populations agree very well , but when translated to higher redshifts , these dwarfs are too faint to be detected at present .",
    "however , in a deep field , the upcoming _ jwst _ mission should be able to detect analogues of the brightest of these objects , corresponding to about @xmath39 of the total light of the dwarf population ( omitting the lmc and smc , and galaxies without measurements ) , assuming that their stars formed early .",
    "this fraction increases if we assume a population of ancient , massive stars in these galaxies at high redshifts ; spectroscopy and number counts will enable us to distinguish these two scenarios . additionally , if these dwarfs have been significantly affected by tidal stripping , then this effect can also amplify the potential for analogues of these galaxies to be detected at high redshifts .",
