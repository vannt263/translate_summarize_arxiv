    "coherent states belong to the most important tools in numerous applications of quantum theory .",
    "the problem of coherent states on the circle was investigated by s. de bivre @xcite , and also by j. a. gonzlez and m. a. del olmo @xcite , based on canonical coherent states @xcite .",
    "the weil - brezin - zak transform of canonical coherent states on the real line was then the essential ingredient leading to a set of coherent states on the circle labeled by the variables of the cylinder @xmath2 .",
    "a different approach was employed by c. j. isham and j. r. klauder @xcite .",
    "they constructed coherent states on the circle by using the euclidean group @xmath3 , which is the semi - direct product of groups @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see also @xcite ) however , they observed that there does not exist an irreducible representation of @xmath3 such that the resolution of unity holds .",
    "therefore they considered only reducible representations and extended the method to the case of the @xmath6-dimensional sphere .",
    "it should be noted that a very detailed study of deformation quantization on the cylinder as classical phase space was recently given in @xcite .",
    "their arguments confirm that in quantum theory the ` quantum ' phase space @xmath0 is involved , which is our starting point in this investigation .",
    "let the configuration space be the unit circle .",
    "the position variable can be identified with the angle , i.e. it takes real values modulo @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 take a value from the interval @xmath9 . in the dirac formalism the _ position operator _ is defined @xmath10 the position operator @xmath11 has continuous spectrum @xmath12 with the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath13 an arbitrary quantum state @xmath14 can be expressed in the form @xmath15 it is useful to expand @xmath16 in the fourier series @xmath17 the function @xmath16 is the wavefunction and the position operator acts on it @xmath18 the momentum eigenvectors are then defined via fourier transform @xmath19 and its inverse @xmath20    in the hilbert space formulation , where @xmath21 we shall follow our approach in @xcite .",
    "the momentum operator will be defined using the unitary representation @xmath22 of the group of rotations @xmath23 of the unit circle , @xmath24(\\beta ) = \\psi(\\beta-\\alpha ) , \\quad \\psi \\in    l^{2}(\\mathbf{s}^{1},d\\varphi ) , \\quad \\alpha,\\beta \\in u(1).\\ ] ] unitary operators @xmath25 shift the argument of functions in @xmath26 .",
    "the momentum operator is then by stone s theorem @xmath27 the position operator @xmath28 formally satisfies the well known commutation relation @xmath29= i\\mathbb{i},\\ ] ] but it is not well - defined on @xmath30 .",
    "in order to define coherent states directly by perelomov s method @xcite , we should first construct a system of unitary operators labeled by elements of the group @xmath31 ; second , it is necessary to determine the ` vacuum ' vector @xmath32 . the system of unitary operators will be defined @xmath33 the factors do not commute @xmath34 but the operator @xmath35 is now well defined on @xmath30 , @xmath36    here , the system of operators @xmath37 does not create a representation of group @xmath31 but thanks to the weyl form of commutation relations we obtain a projective representation of @xmath31 .    the vacuum vector @xmath32 will be determined in analogy with canonical coherent states on @xmath38 .",
    "the requirement that the vacuum state be an eigenvector of annihilation operator with eigenvalue @xmath39 is written here in exponential form @xmath40 using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula the operator @xmath41 could be separated in the product of two operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 in arbitrary order .",
    "such change will not influence the final vacuum state @xmath32 .",
    "condition ( [ qaip ] ) leads to the gauss exponential function @xmath44 hence the vacuum state is an element of our hilbert space , @xmath45 . at @xmath46",
    "it is continuous but its derivative has a small discontinuity ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath48 is given by @xmath49    the system of coherent states on @xmath26 is now obtained by the action of the system of operators @xmath37 on the vacuum state @xmath32 : @xmath50 the functional form of our coherent states is given by @xmath51 i.e. for @xmath52 they are displaced and phased versions of ( [ vacuum ] ) with a discontinuity at @xmath53 .",
    "in this section we shall check several properties of our coherent states which are known to hold for canonical coherent states on @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "first of all , we shall look at the resolution of unity , i.e. we shall prove the following equality for our coherent states : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant .",
    "thus for an arbitrary normalized vector @xmath56 from our hilbert space @xmath26 the identity @xmath57 should hold .",
    "since the inner product of @xmath58 with some coherent state @xmath59 has the integral form @xmath60 one can calculate the constant @xmath55 with the result @xmath61 so that the resolution of unity for our set of coherent states takes the form @xmath62 the next properties to be checked concern the overlaps of our ( normalized ) coherent states given by inner products in @xmath26 .",
    "here it is necessary to correctly realize the way how the operator @xmath63 acts on the hilbert space @xmath26 when the circle @xmath64  our configuration space  is identified with the interval @xmath65 . then the action of operator @xmath66 on function @xmath67 for @xmath68 $ ] has the form : @xmath69 , \\\\      \\psi(\\varphi - \\alpha + 2\\pi ) & \\varphi \\in [ -\\pi , -\\pi +      \\alpha ] .",
    "\\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath70 $ ] we have @xmath71 , \\\\      \\psi(\\varphi - \\alpha -2\\pi ) & \\varphi \\in [ \\pi + \\alpha , \\pi ] .",
    "\\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that one has to consider addition modulo @xmath72 in the argument of function @xmath73 .",
    "this is the reason why the inner product _ can not _ be calculated simply according to @xmath74    from now on we shall restrict ourselves only to the cases when @xmath75 and @xmath76 are non - negative : @xmath77 , \\quad \\beta \\in [ 0,\\pi].\\ ] ] without loss of generality we may also assume @xmath78 taking into account ( [ pro1 ] ) and ( [ pro2 ] ) , we have to split the inner product of two coherent states into two terms @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 in order to evaluate the integrals @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we use the error function of a complex variable @xmath84 , @xmath85 here @xmath86 denotes an arbitrary continuous path of finite length which connects the origin @xmath87 with a complex number @xmath88 .",
    "the integral @xmath82 , after the substitution @xmath89 takes the form @xmath90 which leads to the formula @xmath91.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the other integral @xmath83 , after the substitution @xmath92 , yields @xmath93.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have to admit that , unfortunately , we do not see any way how to further simplify the above analytic expressions of the integrals @xmath82 and @xmath83 to see whether the coherent states are mutually non - orthogonal .",
    "however , we have numerically computed absolute values of the inner products for many pairs of coherent states and have drawn the graphs for several different values of @xmath94 fixed in each graph . it was apparent  for all plotted cases  that the overlap never vanishes .",
    "because of restriction on the length of the contribution we intend to publish a detailed account of the matter including a number of plots confirming this property .",
    "the next checked quantities are the expectation values of the position operator in the coherent states @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath97 or , using the error function , @xmath98 one observes that for @xmath75 positive the expectation values do not depend on @xmath99 ( the same result is obtained also for negative values of @xmath75 ) .",
    "it is interesting that the expectation value of position is nonlinear in @xmath75 for @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath100 the quasi - gaussian ( [ vacuum ] ) is symmetric around @xmath101 , so the expectation value is an integral of an odd function , evidently equal to zero .",
    "however , if @xmath102 $ ] , the displaced quasi - gaussian is no more symmetric around @xmath101 and the integration leads to a deviation depending on a difference of error functions ( [ 245 ] ) ; maximal deviation is attained for @xmath103 .",
    "important among the checked quantities are the expectation values of the momentum operator in coherent states @xmath95 .",
    "the explicit form @xmath104 can be simplified into the formula @xmath105 which could be anticipated by analogy with the canonical coherent states on @xmath38 .",
    "finally , the expectation values of the square of momentum operator in coherent states @xmath95 are determined by computing the integrals @xmath106 e^{-(\\varphi-\\alpha + 2\\pi)^{2}}d\\varphi   \\\\ & + & \\mathcal{a}^{2}\\int_{-\\pi +    \\alpha}^{\\pi}[1+(m+i(\\varphi-\\alpha))^{2 } ] e^{-(\\varphi    -\\alpha)^{2}}d\\varphi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the result @xmath107 which does not depend explicitly on @xmath75 .",
    "for our system of coherent states their overlaps and matrix elements were expressed analytically , then some calculated numerically or evaluated with the help of mathematica .",
    "the property of resolution of unity was shown to hold .",
