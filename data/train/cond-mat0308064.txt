    "the time lag dependent price increments , returns , log - returns , normalized log - returns of financial market indices , stocks and foreign currency exchange markets are known to be non - gaussian distributions and rather exhibit fat - tailed power - law distributions @xcite .",
    "the origin of the so called large volatility characterized by such fat tailed distributions is a key question ; the fat tails in such data are thought to be caused by some  dynamical process  through a hierarchical cascade of short and long - range volatility correlations , though gopikrishnan et al .",
    "consider that correlations and tails have different origins @xcite .",
    "destroying all correlations , e.g. by shuffling the order of the fluctuations , is known to cause the fat tails almost to vanish .",
    "it is still an open question whether both the fat - tailed power - law of partial distribution functions ( pdf ) of the various volatilities and their @xmath3 for _ different time delays _ in financial markets can be described .",
    "the fat tails indicate an unexpected high probability of large price changes .",
    "these extreme events are of utmost importance for risk analysis .",
    "they are considered to be a set of strong bursts in the energy dissipation of so called clusters of high price volatility . in so doing the pdf and the fat tail event existence are thought to be similar to the notion of intermittency in turbulent flows @xcite . indeed employing the fokker - planck equation approach @xcite recent studies",
    "@xcite have shown that the dynamics of a market results from a flow of information between long and short time scales . since the distributions of returns obey a fokker - planck equation , the time evolution of the price @xmath4 signal ( @xmath5 ) measured for a time lag @xmath6 is governed by a langevin equation @xcite    @xmath7    the drift @xmath8 and diffusion @xmath9 coefficients being those of the fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "it is often assumed that @xmath10 is a correlated noise with gaussian statistics .",
    "thus such a dynamics may be analogous to the dissipation of energy from large to small spatial scales in three dimensional turbulence as pointed out already in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the non - gaussian character of the fully developed turbulence @xcite has been linked to nonextensive statistical physics @xcite .",
    "whence recently there has been a large number of studies , e.g. @xcite of financial markets employing the nonextensive statistics including those involving fully developed turbulence approach as in @xcite .",
    "the nonextensivity , i.e. some anomalous scaling of classically extensive properties like the entropy , is linked to a single parameter @xmath11 , e.g. in the tsallis formulation of nonextensive thermostatistics .    in this paper on the study of the behavior of a financial index , i.e. the s&p500 , on @xmath12 time windows , we apply as in @xcite for @xmath13 time windows , a recently suggested model of hydrodynamic turbulence that serves as a dynamic foundation for nonextensive statistics @xcite .",
    "indeed long time lag effects must be also investigated .",
    "furthermore , it is known that some distinction must be made concerning the type of financial market @xmath14 which is examined .",
    "we will compare results based on price increment and normalized log - return time series .    in sect .",
    "2 , we describe the distribution of returns for the daily closing price signal of the s&p500 index for the time interval between jan . 01 , 1980 and dec .",
    "31 , 1999 , thus a series of @xmath155056 data points .",
    "daily closing price values of the s&p500 index for the period of interest were downloaded from yahoo web site .",
    "we characterize the tail(s ) of the distribution for various @xmath6 s , i.e. from 1 up to 40 days , and will observe the value of the pdf tails , for such time lags , outside the best gaussian through the data . in sect .",
    "3 , we calculate the power law exponents characterizing the @xmath16 distribution of the ( normalized log- ) returns over different time lags for the s&p500 index daily closing price through a detrended fluctuation analysis and a power spectral density analysis point of view .",
    "results are compared to shuffled data for estimating the value of the error bars . in sect .",
    "4 , tsallis statistical approach is outlined , and distributions of ( normalized log- ) returns for time lags between @xmath6 = 1 to 40 days are examined .",
    "it is found that the @xmath11-value of the nonextensive entropy converges to a value = 1.22 for @xmath6 = 40  days , starting with @xmath11 = 1.39 for @xmath6 = 1 , values similar to those reported for the intraday evolution of other financial indices , e.g. nasdaq in @xcite and slightly lower than those for s&p500 minute data @xcite .",
    "the probability density @xmath17 of the volatility @xmath18 in terms of the standard deviation of the normalized log returns of the s&p500 for different time lags is found to obey the @xmath0-distribution .",
    "the intermittency exponent ( @xmath2 ) of the kolmogorov log - normal model is found to be related to the scaling exponent of the pdf moments , -thereby giving weight to the model .",
    "the large value of @xmath2 points to a large number of cascades in the underlying turbulent process .    in sect .",
    "5 , the usual fokker - planck approach for treating the time - dependent probability distribution functions is summarized and coefficients governing both the fokker - planck equation for the distribution function of normalized log returns and the langevin equation for the time evolution of normalized log returns of daily closing price signal of s&p500 are obtained .",
    "we will notice that there is  no restoring force  .",
    "therefore we present for the first time a coherent theory linking the shape and tails of partial distribution functions for long and short time lags of the daily closing values of a financial signal and connect the often suggested turbulent nature of the markets to a model encompassing nonextensive statistics and evolution equations of the langevin and fokker - planck type .",
    "we are aware that the number of data points of the time series ( @xmath155056 ) might seem quite small with respect to other studies involving millions of data points .",
    "some previous work had indicated the possible use of 5000 or so data point series in order to obtain scaling arguments and ingredients for models @xcite .",
    "clearly the relative error bars or confidence interval being roughly proportional to @xmath19 have to be taken with caution . thus the conclusions universal value might be debated upon .",
    "nevertheless one positive aspect might be that scaling effects are not _ too sensitive _ to @xmath20 .",
    "we do warn however throughout the report that some caution might also be taken concerning the stationarity of the data .",
    "these @xmath21 might only be resolved through further work .",
    "there are several ways of calculating the returns in a financial market . a simple one represents price increment @xmath22 or difference between the value of the price signal @xmath23 at time @xmath24 and its value at time @xmath25 .",
    "log - returns , i.e. the logarithm of the price ratio @xmath26 $ ] are also used sometimes .",

    "@xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the average and @xmath29 the standard deviation of @xmath30 for a given @xmath6 . the normalized log - returns @xmath31 depend on the time @xmath25 and the time lag @xmath6 . however , in order to simplify the notations and whenever possible without leading to confusion and misunderstanding we will drop the explicit writing of one or both variables .",

    "these findings ( @xmath6-independent gaussian range and tail exponent behavior ) are at odd with the expectation that the pdf tends toward a gaussian for large @xmath6 .",
    "some bayesian - like analysis of the pdf s , i.e. allowing for the expected gaussian width behavior , has been done , with the appropriate conclusion .",

    "thus the fokker - planck approach provides the evolution process of pdf s _ from small time lags to larger ones_. the fact that the drift coefficient is approximately equal to zero , therefore indicating that there is no correlation between the probability distribution functions for different time lags , is well related to the gaussian character of the distribution function for such small values of the normalized log returns @xmath33 $ ] . @xmath181",
    "further implies that there is almost no `` restoring force '' , i.e. @xmath182 in eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) , while the quadratic dependence of @xmath9 in @xmath131 is obviously like an autocorrelation function for a diffusion process .",
    "in summary , we have presented a method that provides the evolution process of probability distribution functions ( over twenty years ) of one financial index , i.e. the s&p500 .",
    "we have studied the evolution process of the tails that are outside the central ( gaussian ) regime at small returns , thereby facilitating the understanding of the evolution of these distribution functions in a fokker - planck framework .",
    "beck turbulence model can be well applied to describe the volatility ( of normalized log - returns ) distributions assuming a @xmath0-distribution for the  local  volatility . an open question in nonextensive thermostatistics studies",
    "is often raised about the meaning , value and behavior of the non extensive exponent , or tsallis parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the intermittency exponent is found to be related to the scaling exponent of the pdf moments in the framework of kolmogorov log - normal model , thereby giving weight to the model and the statistical approach .",
    "the intermittency exponent large value points to a large number of cascades in the turbulent process .",
    "its range has been found to extend up to @xmath1 200 days .",
    "one may still wonder on the @xmath11-value itself .",
    "in other works , this value is related , e.g. to the upper and lower bounds of the multifractal dimension @xcite , in other words to the bounds of the @xmath111 values in multifractal studies @xcite .",
    "it may also be related to the value of the fractional derivative , say in a non - linear fokker - planck equation approach @xcite .",
    "this should be some interesting work to pursue , - again with some warning concerning the possible error bars on the generalized fractal dimension in multifractal studies @xcite .",
    "we have also presented the turbulence - like dynamics through the fokker - planck and the langevin equations .",
    "we have ( unexpectedly ) found that , in the treated case , there is almost no `` restoring force '' , i.e. ( @xmath182 in the langevin equation ) .",
    "a comparison is made between normalized log - returns and mere price increments .",
    "we have examined the corresponding cases of the distribution of price increments with other possible definitions .",
    "it was found that the definition ( through a normalized log return rather than a mere price difference ) is very relevant for obtaining nice fits .",
    "this has been also observed in a work by karth and peinke @xcite on related matter .",
    "this warning might also shine some light on the possible origin of the controversy @xcite concerning the relationship ( or not ) between the fat tails caused by some dynamical hierarchical cascade process of volatility correlations .",
    "these points not withstanding , we have related a financial market behavior to tsallis non extensive thermodynamics approach , i.e. more precisely to a turbulence - like process , - as financial market and indices were often claimed to be seen @xcite .",
    "finally , it seems that we have thoroughly answered the often raised question `` why to look at the tails of a probability distribution function ? and what does that lead to ? '' .",
    "we have also searched for describing the partial distribution function of the ( raw ) increments of daily closing price signal of the s&p500 with the tsallis type distribution function . we have applied eq.([tsallis ] ) for @xmath183 .",
    "we have tested the tsallis type distribution function for the increments of @xmath35  day for fixed @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) and varying @xmath186 ( fig .",
    "14a ) . applying the same set of parameters and to price increments for @xmath187  days ,",
    "leads to a pretty bad fit ( figs .",
    "14b ) . decreasing the value of @xmath11",
    "would not have produce better results since the tsallis type distribution function would have been bounded within smaller range around @xmath188 values . a test for fixed @xmath189 ( @xmath185 ) and varying @xmath190 for @xmath191  day",
    "is next shown in fig .",
    "again the same set of parameters is applied to price increments for @xmath187  days and lead to a pretty bad fit ( figs .",
    "these results may be somewhat expected because the tsallis type distribution function represents a mathematical construction that is designed for normalized variables , i.e. a variable changing within a limited range . to take into account a double peak like structure",
