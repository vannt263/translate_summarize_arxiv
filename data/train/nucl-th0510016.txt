    "the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy @xmath0 is still poorly known but very important for both nuclear physics and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion reactions induced by neutron - rich nuclei provide a unique opportunity to constrain the symmetry energy in a broad density range .",
    "a number of potentially useful probes of the symmetry energy have been proposed in the literature mostly based on transport model simulations .",
    "experimental data from several dedicated experiments just started emerging .",
    "some comparisons between the available experimental data and transport model calculations have been carried out recently .",
    "these studies have allowed us to place important constraints on the density dependence of symmetry energy .",
    "for instance , by using the free - space experimental nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross sections within the transport model ibuu04 @xcite , a symmetry energy of @xmath1 for densities less than @xmath2 was extracted from the msu data on isospin diffusion betty04,chen05 .",
    "while using in - medium nn cross sections calculated within an effective - mass scaling approach @xcite , a symmetry energy of @xmath3 was found most acceptable in comparison with both the msu isospin diffusion data and the presently acceptable neutron - skin thickness in @xmath4pb steiner05,li05 .",
    "the currently existing isospin diffusion data alone can not distinguish the above two forms of the symmetry energy within the experimental error bars @xcite .",
    "thus complementary observables sensitive to the @xmath0 , more desirably , studies on correlations of several such observables , are still very much needed to further constrain the symmetry energy .    because the symmetry potentials have opposite signs for neutrons and protons and the fact that the symmetry potentials are generally smaller compared to the isoscalar potential at the same density , most of the observables proposed so far use differences or ratios of isospin multiplets of baryons , mirror nuclei and mesons , such as , the neutron / proton ratio of nucleon emissions @xcite , neutron - proton differential flow @xcite , neutron - proton correlation function @xcite , @xmath5/@xmath6he chen03a , zhang05 , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 ratios @xcite , etc . among these observables ,",
    "the neutron / proton ratio of nucleon emissions has probably the highest sensitivity to the symmetry energy .",
    "this is because symmetry potentials act directly on nucleons and normally nucleon emissions are rather abundant in typical heavy - ion reactions .",
    "however , it is very challenging to measure some of these observables , especially those involving neutrons .",
    "the measurement of neutrons , especially the low energy ones , always suffers from low detection efficiencies even for the most advanced neutron detectors .",
    "therefore , observables involving neutrons normally have large systematic errors",
    ". moreover , for essentially all of these observables , the coulomb force on charged particles plays an important role .",
    "it sometimes competes strongly with the symmetry potentials .",
    "one has to disentangle carefully effects of the symmetry potentials from those due to the coulomb potentials .",
    "it is thus very desirable to find experimental observables which can reduce the influence of both the coulomb force and the systematic errors associated with neutrons .",
    "the double neutron / proton ratio of nucleon emissions taken from two reaction systems using four isotopes of the same element , namely , the neutron / proton ratio in the neutron - rich system over that in the more symmetric system , was recently proposed by lynch et al.@xcite as a candidate of such an observable . they have actually measured the double neutron / proton ratio in central reactions of @xmath10sn@xmath11sn and @xmath12sn@xmath13sn at a beam energy of @xmath14 mev / nucleon at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory@xcite . while the experimental data are currently being finalized , we report here transport model analyses of the double neutron / proton rations . besides the above two reactions we also study the double neutron / proton ratio in @xmath15sn@xmath11sn and @xmath12sn@xmath13sn reactions at @xmath16 mev / nucleon .",
    "it is shown that the double neutron / proton ratio has about the same sensitivity to the density dependence of symmetry energy as the corresponding single ratio in the respective neutron - rich system involved .",
    "given the advantages of measuring the double neutron / proton ratios over the single ones , the study of double neutron / proton ratios will be more useful for further constraining the symmetry energy of neutron - rich matter .",
    "our study is carried out using the ibuu04 version of an isospin and momentum dependent transport model for nuclear reactions induced by neutron - rich nuclei @xcite . for completeness and consistency",
    "we outline here a few major features most relevant to the present study . more details of the model can be found in refs .",
    "the single nucleon potential is one of the most important inputs to all transport models for nuclear reactions . in the ibuu04 transport model",

    "the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 were obtained by fitting the momentum - dependence of the @xmath28 to that predicted by the gogny hartree - fock and/or the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) calculations bombaci , the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy of about @xmath29 mev at normal nuclear matter density @xmath30 @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the incompressibility @xmath32 of symmetric nuclear matter at @xmath33 is set to be @xmath34 mev consistent with the latest conclusion from studying giant resonances k0data , pie04,colo04 .",

    "the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential stems from the different interaction strength parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 for a nucleon of isospin @xmath46 interacting , respectively , with unlike and like nucleons in the background fields .",
    "more specifically , we use @xmath47 mev and @xmath48 mev . with these parameters ,",
    "the isoscalar potential estimated from @xmath49 agrees reasonably well with predictions from the variational many - body theory @xcite , the bhf approach @xcite including three - body forces and the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) calculations @xcite in broad ranges of density and momentum .",
    "for the mdi potential we used here , the neutron - proton effective mass splitting due to the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential is positive @xcite .",

    "the ibuu04 model can use either the free - space experimental nn cross sections @xcite or the in - medium nn cross sections calculated using an effective - mass scaling model consistent with the single particle potential used @xcite . in the present work the in - medium nn cross sections are used .",

    "we present and discuss here the double neutron / proton ratios of free nucleons in central and mid - central reactions using three sn isotopes at a beam energy of @xmath14 mev / nucleon and @xmath16 mev / nucleon , respectively .",
    "free nucleons are identified as those having local baryon densities less than @xmath53 . for a comparison and as an example",
    ", we first study the single neutron / proton ratio of free nucleons for @xmath10sn@xmath11sn and @xmath12sn@xmath13sn reactions at a beam energy of @xmath14 mev / nucleon and an impact parameter of @xmath52 fm , respectively . shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] are the time evolutions of the single neutron / proton ratios versus the nucleon kinetic energy in the c.m.s frame of the respective reaction .",
    "it is seen that the neutron / proton ratio becomes stable after about @xmath54 fm / c . as one expects , the neutron / proton ratio in the neutron - richer system is more sensitive to the symmetry energy , especially for fast nucleons . with the softer symmetry energy of @xmath39 ,",
    "the symmetry energy and the magnitude of the symmetry potential are higher at sub - saturation densities compared to the case with @xmath43 . at supra - saturation densities , however , it is just the opposite as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . in the above two reactions the maximum density reached is about @xmath41@xcite .",
    "one thus expects to see a higher neutron / proton ratio of free nucleons with the softer symmetry energy of @xmath39 due to the stronger repulsive ( attractive ) symmetry potential for neutrons ( protons ) . for the more symmetric system @xmath12sn@xmath13sn ,",
    "effects of the symmetry energy are negligible because of the small isospin asymmetry in the system .",
    "the rise of the neutron / proton ratio at low energies in both systems is due to the coulomb force which pushes protons away from the center of mass of the reaction .",
    "these features are all consistent with those found in an earlier study using a momentum - independent transport model @xcite . unlike the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the observed symmetry energy effect is only about @xmath55 to @xmath56 even for the most energetic nucleons in the @xmath10sn@xmath11sn reaction .",
    "this is understandable since the symmetry energy used here has already been severely constrained by the recent isospin diffusion data . in ref.@xcite , however , a much wider uncertainty range between approximately @xmath57 and @xmath58 was used for the symmetry energy .",
    "sn@xmath59sn and @xmath12sn@xmath13sn at @xmath14  mev / nucleon and an impact parameter of @xmath52  fm ( upper window ) and @xmath60  fm ( lower window ) , respectively . ]",
    "we now turn to the double neutron / proton ratio of free nucleons . shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] are the double neutron / proton ratios calculated for the @xmath10sn@xmath11sn and @xmath12sn@xmath13sn reactions at a beam energy of @xmath14 mev / nucleon and an impact parameter of @xmath52 fm ( upper window ) and @xmath60 fm ( lower window ) , respectively . as a reference , a straight line at @xmath61 corresponding to the double neutron / proton ratio of the entrance channel",
    "is also drawn .",
    "below the pion production threshold , statistically , one would expect the double neutron / proton ratio of nucleon emissions to be a constant close to this value neglecting effects due to both the coulomb and symmetry potentials .",
    "indeed , the observed double neutron / proton ratios especially at low kinetic energies with @xmath43 at both impact parameters are almost constants just slightly above the straight line at @xmath61 .",
    "the fact that the double neutron / proton ratio is slightly higher than @xmath61 even with @xmath43 ( which corresponds to a weaker symmetry potential at sub - saturation densities compared to the case with x=0 ) is due to the appreciable repulsive / attractive symmetry potential on neutrons / protons in the @xmath10sn@xmath11sn reaction . for the double ratios in the two reactions involving isotopes of the same element one",
    "expects that the coulomb effects are largely cancelled out .",
    "more energetic nucleons have gone through denser regions of the reactions , effects of the symmetry potentials on them are thus higher especially in the case with @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the double neutron / proton ratios increase when the @xmath37 parameter is changed from @xmath43 to @xmath39 , especially for energetic nucleons .    at both impact parameters , effects of the symmetry energy",
    "are about @xmath62 changing from @xmath43 to @xmath39 for the energetic nucleons which are mostly from pre - equilibrium emissions .",
    "the observed sensitivity to the symmetry energy is about the same as the single neutron / proton ratio shown in fig .",
    "it should also be mentioned that since the neutron / proton ratio at kinetic energies less than about @xmath14 mev is rather insensitive to the symmetry energy in the reactions at a beam energy of @xmath14 mev / nucleon , neutron detectors with a threshold energy of @xmath14 mev is sufficient for the study discussed here . however , as we shall discuss in the following , with reactions at beam energies above the pion production threshold even the low energy neutrons are useful .",

    "in fact , the @xmath7 ratio itself is a promising probe of the symmetry energy at high densities@xcite .",
    "although the symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities is currently not constrained by any experimental data , for this study , we keep using the two parameters @xmath39 and @xmath43 to be consistent with the symmetry energy used for sub - saturation densities . shown in fig .",

    "are about @xmath65 changing from the case with @xmath39 to @xmath43 .",
    "one notices here that the low energy nucleons are having the largest sensitivity to the variation of the symmetry energy for such high energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in fact , the neutron / proton ratio of midrapidity nucleons which have gone through the high density phase of the reaction are known to be most sensitive to the symmetry energy @xcite . compared to the results at the beam energy of @xmath14 mev / nucleon",
    ", it is interesting to see a clear turnover in the dependence of the double neutron / proton ratio on the @xmath66 parameter , namely the double ratio is lower at @xmath14 mev / nucleon but higher at @xmath16 mev / nucleon with @xmath43 than that with @xmath39 .",
    "the maximum density reached at the beam energy of @xmath14 and @xmath16 mev / nucleon is about @xmath41 and @xmath67 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the turnover clearly indicates that the double neutron / proton ratio reflects closely the density dependence of the symmetry energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "this observation also indicates that systematic studies of the double neutron / proton ratio over a broad beam energy range will be important for mapping out the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "it is useful to mention that the double @xmath7 ratio in the reactions at @xmath16 mev / nucleon has also been examined .",
    "there is some indication that the double @xmath7 ratio for intermediate energy pions is more sensitive to the symmetry energy than the single @xmath7 ratio in the @xmath15sn@xmath11sn reaction .",
    "however , unlike the double neutron / proton ratio in the same ensemble of events , the double @xmath7 ratio has much larger statistical errors mostly because of the poor statistics of the single @xmath7 ratio in the @xmath12sn@xmath13sn reaction .",
    "studies on the double @xmath7 ratio with significant more events are in progress .",
    "in summary , within the transport model ibuu04 we investigated the double neutron / proton ratio of nucleon emissions taken from two reaction systems using three sn isotopes at the beam energy of @xmath14 mev / nucleon and @xmath16 mev / nucleon , respectively .",
    "it is found that the double neutron / proton ratio has about the same sensitivity to the density dependence of symmetry energy as the single neutron / proton ratio in the more neutron - rich system of the two reactions .",
