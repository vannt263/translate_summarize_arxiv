    "a single stellar population is a set of stars having the same age and initial chemical composition ( in terms of both he and metal abundances ) , and different mass , distributed according to an initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "this definition , which is described by a single isochrone in the colour - magnitude diagram , may possibly be extended to include binaries .",
    "single stellar population is a tool widely used in stellar and galactic evolution context .",
    "stellar populations in galaxies are usually assumed to be reproduced by suitably weighted sums of single stellar populations .",
    "stellar clusters were usually considered good examples of single stellar populations .",
    "many concepts of stellar evolution were developed in order to describe the location of stars in the colour - magnitude diagram of clusters using the single stellar population concept .",
    "a short list includes the nature of blue stragglers , the inclusion of mass loss in stellar models , the explanation of the horizontal branch ( hb ) including semi - convection , most aspects of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) evolution , the evolution of stars along the white dwarf cooling sequence , the transformations between theoretical and observational planes , etc .",
    "single stellar population is clearly a very useful concept . as many other approximations",
    ", it however fails when subject to deeper scrutiny .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagram of a globular cluster may look as an isochrone at first glance , that is , a globular cluster appears close to a single stellar population ; however , a closer examination soon reveals for instance , that the hb of most globular clusters can not be reproduced by a single stellar population . in a way , the fact that real clusters are not exactly single stellar populations should be obvious , since instantaneous star formation and complete chemical homogeneity of the original molecular cloud are not to be expected .",
    "however , the departures of globular clusters from single stellar population are much larger and significant than simply a small spread of the formation epoch or original inhomogeneities .",
    "it can be shown that galaxies can not be reproduced by a suitably weighted sum of a number of single stellar population - globular clusters .",
    "rather , multiple populations ( mps ) in globular clusters provide information on how they formed , and on the likely relation with the host galaxy . throughout this review",
    ", we will use the term  multiple populations \" as the synonymous of  multiple generations of stars \" that can be distinguished either from their spectra or from multiple sequences in the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "other authors prefer limiting this definition only to those cases where multiple main sequences or subgiant branches - but oddly not horizontal branches or red giant branches ( rgbs ) - have been observed .",
    "we think that such a distinction only arises for historical reasons and does not help to understand the wide implications of the multiple population question .",
    "observation of multiple main sequences and subgiant branches require photometry of exquisite quality , and is up to now limited to only a few cases - a sample which is however growing steadily in the last few years .",
    "the case of ngc  6397 , a globular cluster thought to have an astonishingly narrow main sequence , which has been shown to consists of two close but distinct sequences by milone et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , is emblematic . while it is clear that other confirmations of the correlation between spectroscopic and photometric properties would be welcome , the observational data are already sufficiently strong to make the conclusion about its reality robust , and justify our use of the multiple population concept .",
    "progress in the last few years have in fact shown that globular cluster formation is a complex phenomenon .",
    "scenarios for globular cluster formation now include several generations of stars , that we may schematically divide into a primordial , first generation and a second generation , although the second generation likely consists of several distinct sub - populations .",
    "the second generation stars form from material polluted by the ejecta of a fraction of the first generation population ( gratton et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ; ramirez & cohen 2002 ; carretta et al .",
    "evidence for the presence of these different populations stems from their chemical composition , in particular the abundances of the light elements involved in proton - capture processes ( c , n , o , f , na , mg , al , si : osborn 1971 ; cottrell and norris 1981 ; kraft 1978 , 1994 ; gratton et al . 2001 , 2004 ; see carretta et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b , and references therein ) , as well as from the splitting of sequences in the colour - magnitude diagram ( see piotto 2009 ) .",
    "most of the stars currently in globular clusters belong to the second generation that is characterised by a peculiar composition , rarely found among field stars .",
    "the residual component of the first generation , low - mass stars with the composition typical of the ejecta of core - collapse supernovae ( e.g. truran & arnett 1971 ) and similar to that of field halo stars , is still present in globular clusters , but is only a third of the current total population .",
    "since the peculiar composition of the second generation stars requires that they formed from the ejecta of only a fraction of the first generation stars ( the so called  polluters \" ) , it may be concluded that globular clusters were created within massive episodes of star formation and that most of their original population has been lost .",
    "this has renewed the interest for the relation existing between globular clusters and field halo : it is even possible that most of the halo of our galaxy - and by extension of other environments with a similar high specific frequency of globular clusters - formed within these massive star formation episodes .",
    "many aspects of this scenario are still unclear and currently debated .",
    "they concern the timescale of the phenomenon and the related issue of the nature of the polluters ; the need for  dilution \" of the processed material with unprocessed material ( see prantzos & charbonnel 2006 ) and the origin of the diluting material ; the construction of realistic hydrodynamical models ; the identification and characterisation of young , present - day counterparts ; the connection between different observational aspects of the phenomenon ( photometry vs spectroscopy ; the evidence in different evolutionary phases ; the connection with anomalies in the colour - magnitude diagram such as extended , blue hbs ; the agb ; etc . ) ; the range of masses of the original population and the relation with open clusters , nuclear star clusters , ultra - compact dwarf galaxies , and dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) ; the rle of globular clusters in galactic evolution , etc .    the reader should also be alerted that in addition to the scenario we discuss in this review , there are several mechanisms that can potentially produce chemical inhomogeneities in globular clusters .",
    "they include :    * original inhomogeneities in the material from which the globular cluster formed ( see e.g. kraft 1979 ) . at variance with earlier findings , star forming regions and very young clusters are now usually found to be chemically homogeneous in spite of evidence of rather prolonged star formation ; this suggests that interstellar matter is effectively well mixed and that self - enrichment was not relevant ( see e.g. , shen et al .",
    "2005 ; dorazi & randich 2009 ; nieva & simon - diaz 2011 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , globular clusters are much more massive objects , and likely formed in very large although compact star forming regions .",
    "chemical inhomogeneities might either be primordial , caused by inadequate mixing of the interstellar matter from which the stars formed , or through some - perhaps limited - capability of retaining ejecta of the most rapidly evolving stars , since the formation of the globular cluster must have taken some time .",
    "various authors ( see the review by mckee & ostriker 2007 and references therein ) suggest that star formation within a giant molecular cloud occurs on timescales comparable to a few times ( 1 - 3 ) the crossing time ( roughly , @xmath0  myr , where @xmath1  is the mass of the cloud in units of @xmath2  m@xmath3 ) . keeping in mind that the final cluster is a few percent of the original giant molecular cloud ( see below ) , a timescale of 30  myr for the formation of the primordial population of a cluster such as m  54 and @xmath4  cen ( currently a few @xmath2  m@xmath3 ) seems fully reasonable .",
    "clusters smaller in size by an order of magnitude ( that is , typical clusters with @xmath5 ) should have required a shorter but not negligible time ( @xmath6  myr ) . on the other hand ,",
    "galactic giant molecular clouds seem to have an upper limit to their mass of a few @xmath2  m@xmath3 ; larger masses are usually called giant molecular associations , because they fragment in smaller pieces .",
    "it is not clear whether this depends on metallicity or environment .",
    "this is likely the reason why globular clusters do not form any more in the milky way , given the low efficiency with which giant molecular clouds can be transformed in clusters .",
    "also , fragmentation of the larger giant molecular clouds may lead to more complicate geometries , and then to smaller efficiencies in the cloud - to - cluster transformation . *",
    "peculiar evolution of individual stars , either because they are members of interacting binaries , or because some parameter such as , for example , internal rotation , may cause significant alterations to the surface chemical composition , due e.g. to a high mass loss rate or meridional circulation ( sweigart & mengel 1979 ) .",
    "this mechanism has long been considered in connection to the na - o anticorrelation ( see the reviews by kraft 1979 , 1994 ) , as well as the hb second parameter ( see the review by catelan 2009 ) .",
    "interacting binaries have certainly a rle in explaining the blue stragglers and other peculiar objects , such as millisecond pulsars , found in globular clusters , but these are only a small minority of the cluster stars .",
    "the impact of peculiar evolution on the global properties of globular clusters has never been assessed in a definitive way in spite of many attempts .",
    "it is possible and even likely that overall mass loss is slightly different from star - to - star in globular clusters ( see the discussion in catelan 2009 ) ; however , this effect is probably small and can not explain most of the phenomenology and regularities discussed throughout this review .",
    "* merging of globular clusters . while this event is very unlikely to occur in the halo of the milky way owing to the very large relative velocities of globular clusters , it might happen in dsph s such as , e.g. sagittarius ( sgr ) , where the spread of velocities within the galaxy are comparable to that within the globular clusters .",
    "globular clusters formed in a dsph may then be inherited by the milky way when the dsph is tidally destroyed , as is observed for sgr . in these conditions",
    ", dynamical friction may be very efficient , leading the most massive clusters to spiral toward the dsph centre and merge ( see e.g. bellazzini et al .",
    "a similar fate is likely to occur for binary clusters such as those frequently observed in the magellanic clouds ( bhatia & hatzidimitriou 1988 ) . * interstellar matter originally unrelated to the cluster may cumulate around deep potential wells and provide material for new episodes of star formation .",
    "this mechanism is likely active around the central black hole in galactic nuclei , and might explain the origin of the nuclear star clusters observed in almost all late type galaxies including the milky way ( bker 2010 ) where there seems to be repeated episodes of star formation ( krabbe et al . 1995 ; rossa et al .",
    "2006 ; walcher et al .",
    "the potential wells of these objects are typically much deeper than for globular clusters , except possibly for the most massive ones . accretion of interstellar matter by globular clusters has been recently modelled by various authors ( bekki & mackey 2009 ; conroy & spergel 2011 , but see dercole et al .",
    "2011 for the limits on the amount of pristine interstellar matter that may be involved in the second generation formation to reproduce the observed abundance pattern ) , and might be an attractive explanation for those cases where the relative velocities are small , such as the magellanic cloud clusters with multiple main sequence turn - off s ( to s ) .    the chemical imprinting of these various mechanisms is likely different from that originated by the scenario of multiple populations related to the cluster formation we will discuss throughout this review .",
    "for instance , most of them can not produce o - poor stars , typically observed only in the cluster environment .",
    "however , since they may perhaps occasionally occur , they may complicate the observational pattern .",
    "one of the main purposes of current investigations is to separate the aftermaths of these different mechanisms , in order to properly understand what globular clusters are and how they formed .    in this review",
    ", we describe recent progress in the investigation of multiple populations in globular clusters .",
    "we mainly focus on the progress made after the last review by gratton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , in turn an update of the review by kraft ( 1994 ) .",
    "our presentation is biased toward evidence from spectroscopy , which is the field where the authors are more expert .",
    "a recent review of evidence from photometry can be found in piotto ( 2009 ) .",
    "excellent reviews on related topics include helmi ( 2008 ) , which discusses the characteristics and origin of the galactic halo ; brodie & strader ( 2006 ) , which presents evidence on extragalactic globular cluster systems ; and portegies - zwaart et al .",
    "( 2010 ) on young massive stellar clusters .",
    "very useful is also the series of papers on stellar clusters which appeared in volume 368 of the philosophical transactions of the royal society .",
    "the review is organised as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we present the evidence for multiple stellar populations along the colour magnitude diagram .",
    "both photometric and spectroscopic results will be reviewed . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we discuss the relevant aspects of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis and the related scenarios for globular cluster formation and early evolution . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we analyse the connection between globular clusters and the halo of our galaxy , focusing on the impact of multiple stellar populations .",
    "a short presentation of open questions and expected advances is given in the concluding section .",
    "in this section , we describe the phenomenology of the multiple populations along the different evolutionary sequences of globular clusters , beginning with the main sequence even if the first evidence came of course from the brighter , evolved rgb stars .      for a long time",
    "the photometric narrow evolutionary sequences were interpreted as proofs of the single - age , single - metallicity nature of globular clusters .",
    "however , variations in light elements were being found in ms stars as early as at the beginning of the 80 s .",
    "hesser & bell ( 1980 ) found different cn band strengths in seven ms stars of 47  tuc , similar to that found for giants ; they noted that this implies a primordial origin , since there is no mechanism able to mix n to the surface in ms stars , at variance with rgb ones ( see sect .",
    "[ rgb ] ) .",
    "similar findings were presented , e.g. , by cannon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) together with a well developed discussion of the possible sources .",
    "while it was recognised that mixing was not a viable explanation because ms low - mass stars do not have a convective envelope able to transport the nuclearly processed material to the atmosphere , the other possibilities ( primordial origin caused by two or more protocluster gas clouds , self - enrichment due to a second generation of stars , and surface pollution caused by mass transfer on already formed stars ) were considered and debated .",
    "the amount of data increased , and generally a bimodality in cn strength and an anticorrelation between cn and ch was found ( see e.g. , cohen 1999a , b ; harbeck et al .",
    "2003 ; briley el al . 2004",

    ". more recently kayser et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and pancino et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have measured cn and ch in eight and 12 globular clusters , respectively , partly in common , explicitly interpreting their results in the multiple population scenario .",
    "it was only later that measures of the other existing variations in light elements ( na , o , al , mg , see sect .  [ rgb ] ) could be made for stars on the ms . using low resolution spectra , briley et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found significant variations in na , correlated with cn , in six stars at the main sequence turn - off of 47  tuc .",
    "the seminal work was by gratton et al .",

    "they analyzed uves spectra at high resolution , finding clear anticorrelations ( especially when also unevolved , sgb stars were considered ) between o and na , and mg and al , similar to what was present in rgb stars . since the temperature at which the reactions that produce na , and especially those that destroy mg ( 70 mk , arnould et al .",
    "1999 ) , can not be reached by low - mass , ms stars ( see sect .  [ sec:3 ] ) , this was a clear indication of an external origin .",
    "this was later confirmed on rather small samples by ramirez & cohen ( 2002 , 2003 ) for m  71 and m  5 , carretta et al .",

    "the abundance of li and the ( possible ) dispersion and ( anti)correlation with o and na could be robust indicators not only of mixing phenomena but of the nature of the polluting stars , since li can be produced by agb stars , but not by rapidly rotating massive stars ( see sect .",

    "photometric evidence of multiple populations came later , but it had an immediate impact on the community , both because it was more easily recognisable and because the times were ripe for a change of perspective .",
    "data were obtained using the superb capabilities of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , which permitted the beating down of the photometric uncertainties obtaining very clean colour - magnitude diagrams where also subtle features could be seen . not surprisingly , the first identification of multiple mss was in @xmath4 cen ; bedin et al .

    "2007 ) , which could differ in he content , as suggested by norris ( 2004 ) , with the bluer sequence enriched to y@xmath7 . intermediate - low resolution stacked spectra of stars on the blue and red mss were analysed by piotto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , providing the surprising result that the blue ms is about 0.3 dex more metal - rich than the red one , which could be explained if it were enriched in he to y@xmath8 .",

    "they linked the three sequences to the three groups of stars along the na - o anticorrelation ( carretta et al .",

    "[ rgb ] ) and the three parts of the hb ( sect .",
    "[ hb ] ) on the basis of number counts and evolutionary considerations .",
    "the very high sensitivity of x - shooter@vlt permitted the chemical tagging of two faint ms stars , one on the red ms ( rms ) , one on the blue ms ( bms ) .",

    "2010b and fig .",
    "[ f : n2808 ] ) ; while based on a very limited sample , this appears to be a convincing confirmation of the scenario of multiple populations in globular clusters .",
    "further , less spectacular cases for a spread or split ms were presented for 47  tuc ( anderson et al .",

    "2010 ) , and ngc  6397 ( milone et al . 2011 ) ; di criscienzo ( 2010a , b ) interpreted the mss of ngc  6397 and 47  tuc in the light of a ( small ) spread in he abundance .",
    "finally , the globular clusters in the magellanic clouds merit a special mention .",
    "bertelli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found an indication of a possible prolonged star formation for the large magellanic cloud cluster ngc  2173 .",
    "however , the first clear indications of multiple population in magellanic cloud globular clusters came again from hst photometry , see e.g. , mackey & broby nielsen ( 2007 ) ; milone et al .",

    "( 2008 ) ; and goudfrooij et al . ( 2011 ) .",
    "these authors found that many magellanic cloud intermediate - age clusters ( age about 1 - 2 gyr ) show a spread or split main sequence turn - off and often also a dual red clump ; in particular , milone et al . examined 16 globular clusters finding a signature of multiple main sequence turn - offs in 11 of them .",
    "if this is due to an age difference , the implied interval is of about 200 - 700 myr , even if a prolonged star formation is a possible alternative ( e.g. , rubele et al . 2010 ) .",

    "most of the active debate is centred on the two above mentioned main candidate polluters , frms ( 20 - 120  @xmath30 ) and intermediate mass agb stars ( 4 - 11  @xmath30 ) ; it is even possible that both mechanisms are active , though perhaps only in a minority of globular clusters , as suggested by valcarce & catelan ( 2011 ) . in an elegant paper ,",
    "prantzos et al . (",

    "according to the required temperature ( a strong constraint , since it depends only on the nuclear rate ) , both massive agb and the most massive ms stars can reach the high values needed to make them suitable candidate polluters of the star - forming gas in globular clusters .",
    "we however note that current models for both agb and frms are not able to reproduce the exact pattern of abundances observed ( see carretta et al .",

    "karakas 2010 ) .",
    "for instance , agb stars have difficulties reproducing the severe o - depletion observed in the most extreme globular cluster stars ( [ o / fe]@xmath31 : ventura & dantona 2009 ) , while only the most massive frms ( @xmath32m@xmath3 ) are able to reach these low values ( decressin et al .",
    "2007 ) .    concerning the nucleosynthesis",
    ", the obvious bottom line is that polluted stars must be he - enriched , since he is the main outcome of h - burning .",
    "there are many indications for he abundance variations : multiple mss ( sect .",

    "the he production occurs in the ms for both kinds of polluters .",
    "however , while the @xmath13capture elements are also produced in the same phase in the frms , their production is decoupled from that of he for agb stars . in @xmath33stars",
    ", he is brought to the envelope by the second dredge - up ( becker & iben 1979 , see also ventura et al . 2002 and renzini 2008 ) , while the light elements are produced in @xmath13capture reactions in hot bottom burning ( scalo et al .",
    "1975 ; blcker & schnberner 1991 ; sackmann & boothroyd 1992 ) during the agb phase . while frms are able to produce the extremely large he abundances ( @xmath34 ) probably required to explain the blue ms of @xmath4  cen and ngc  2808 ( bedin et al . 2004",
    "; norris 2004 ; piotto et al .",
    "2005 ; dantona et al . 2005 ; piotto et al .",
    "2007 ) , it is difficult to produce @xmath34  with agb stars , although values up to @xmath35  can be possibly produced by super - agb stars ( siess 2007 ; ventura & dantona 2011 ) .    in both cases",
    "we however expect that he is produced as a primary element , and that its production is fairly independent on metallicity ; the amount of he that can be returned to the interstellar matter is a function of the stellar mass . on the other hand , the temperature ( efficiency ) of the h - burning where light elements are forged depends on metallicity , being higher in lower metallicity stars .",
    "therefore , the same na / o ratio is given by smaller mass polluters in lower metallicity globular clusters .",
    "observationally , if we consider only stars with similar na / o abundance ratios ( for instance , the intermediate i component of carretta et al .",
    "2009a ) , we should then expect a correlation between the he production ( e.g. , the difference in colour on the rgb ) and metallicity .",

    "the maximum na abundances present instead only a small spread , among the 19 clusters .",
    "this indicates that only a subset of polluters responsible for the na , o variations was able to reach temperatures sufficiently high to activate the mgal cycle . the  leakage \" from the mgal cycle on si ( yong et al .",
    "2005 ) , producing a mg - si anticorrelation and a si - al correlation , observed in several clusters ( carretta et al .",

    "1999 ; ventura et al .",

    "the production of al was found to depend on the [ fe / h ] and @xmath24  of globular clusters , similarly to the extreme o processing ( carretta et al .",
    "2009a ) , indicating that the polluters properties change regularly with cluster luminosity and metallicity .",
    "unfortunately , only a qualitative agreement seems reached by current theoretical predictions of nucleosynthesis , and only after some adjustments of reaction rates of key ingredients ( e.g. , the @xmath37ne(p,@xmath38 ) for na in agb models , ventura & dantona 2008 ; and by a large factor the @xmath39mg(p,@xmath38 ) rate for frms , decressin et al .",
    "a promising diagnostic seems to be the output from the mgal cycle .",
    "if the scenario of frms is valid , we should expect more than a single gas pool ( as predicted by the agb scenario , see dercole et al .",
    "2008 , and below in this section ) , because in the original frms scenario , second generation stars were supposed to form around each polluter , with a range of yields depending on the mass and rotation rate . in this case , a broader na - al distribution , instead of a uniparametric relation , should be expected .",
    "this is what is possibly seen for a few globular clusters ( e.g. , ngc  3201 , ngc  6254 , carretta et al .",
    "2009b ; m  3 , sneden et al .",
    "2004 ) , while for other globular clusters a single relation is reasonable , so more extensive studies are required .",
    "note , however , that in the latest version of the frms scenario ( decressin et al .",
    "2010 ) the idea of second generation stars formed around each individual star is abandoned in favour of a gathering of all circumstellar disks in a common reservoir at the cluster centre , similar to the agb scenario .",
    "a sensitive test for the nature of the polluter is provided by li abundances , since li is destroyed at temperature of about @xmath40  k , i.e , it can not survive at the temperature of hot h - burning .",
    "therefore the ejecta of frms must be li - free .",
    "on the other hand , some li production is possible for agb stars through the cameron & fowler ( 1971 ) mechanism , so that the lack of li - o correlation or a slope clearly different from unity would only be consistent with the agbs .",
    "the li - o correlation found by shen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in ngc  6752 is statistically significant , but they observed less li depletion than o depletion . a similar result has been obtained for m  4 ( mucciarelli et al .",

    "the polluting matter seems li - enriched , favouring the agb scenario .",
    "it is however curious that the li yields for agb stars are similar to the spite plateau level ( dantona & ventura 2010 ) ; these yields are sensitive to the adopted mass loss law .",
    "finally , the study of heavy elements from @xmath23process nucleosynthesis may provide important clues regarding the nature of first - generation polluters .",
    "frms may produce at most only the lightest of these elements ( see however the claim by chiappini et al .",

    "2010 for the constancy of this sum ) , these observations have been interpreted as convincing evidence of pollution by agbs .",
    "however , there might be a significant timescale problem , since only the most massive agbs ( 4 - 8  @xmath30 ) and the super - agbs ( pumo et al . 2008 ; ventura et al .",
    "2009 ) contribute to the enrichment / depletion in light elements , on a time range between 40 and 160 myr ( schaller et al . 1992 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the timescales involved in low - mass producers of @xmath23process elements are of 340 myr up to almost 2  gyr .",
    "this implies a time delay of several @xmath42  yr to be added - rather _ ad hoc _ - in the phase of pollution from agbs , which should instead run smoothly . in these cases , the abundance of f , an element involved in @xmath13capture reaction , but only poorly studied in globular cluster ( smith et al .",
    "2005 ; yong et al .",

    "the observations ( e.g. , smith & norris 1982 ; carretta et al .",
    "2009a ) show that the residual first generation component observed in globular cluster is much less than the second generation formed by ejecta of its massive stars .",
    "if a canonical imf is adopted , the total mass of agb ejecta in a globular cluster is only 1 - 10% of the total globular cluster mass ( bekki & norris 2006 ) ; similarly , if slow wind from frms stars is used to accumulate polluted mass , this provides only about 10% of the total number of low - mass stars ( decressin et al .",
    "2007b ) .    a first way out could be to assume a non canonical , top - heavy imf for the first generation ( dantona & caloi 2004 ; bekki & norris 2006 ; decressin et al .",
    "2007a , b ) .",
    "the second solution was proposed for the first time by bekki et al .",
    "( 2007 ) : the globular clusters must have been initially a large factor ( 10 - 100 ) more massive than today and almost all the first generation stars must have been preferentially lost .",
    "this may occur as response to early mass loss ( e.g. , dercole et al .",
    "2008 ; vesperini et al . 2010 ; decressin et al .",
    "2010 ) for which gas expulsion by supernovae is an ideal candidate .",
    "the induced change in the potential well unbinds stars in the outer part of the cluster ( mostly first generation stars , because the second generation is more centrally concentrated , especially such early in a cluster lifetime ) , generating the preferential loss .",
    "this approach is currently adopted by all groups ( dercole et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ; decressin et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 , 2010 ; carretta et al .",
    "2010 , gratton & carretta 2010 ; conroy 2011 ; schaerer & charbonnel 2011 ; bekki 2011 ) . were the initial mass of a globular cluster similar to the one currently observed ( conroy & spergel 2010 ) , the degree of pollution would be insufficient to reproduce the observations ( dercole et al . 2011 ) .",
    "alternatively , the globular clusters could be born within larger systems , such as ancestral dwarf galaxies , that contributed the yields of a much larger agb population ( bekki et al .",
    "2007 ) to form the second generation ( see also bker 2008 ; carretta et al . 2010a ; and bekki 2011 for this particular scenario ) .",
    "the two main scenarios share a few common features .",
    "in particular , both predict that second generation stars should be initially more centrally concentrated . in the dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) model this naturally follows from the concept of cooling flow ; in the scenario by decressin et al .",
    "( 2007b ) , massive polluters are born in , or migrated rapidly to , the cluster centre , so that second generation stars are only created there . however , in the following evolution with two - body relaxation processes , first generation and second generation stars are mixed into a quite homogeneous structure in about two relaxation times ( decressin et al .",
    "2008 ; dercole et al .",
    "2008 ) and after a hubble time any radial difference between the two components is expected to be completely erased ( decressin et al .",
    "2010 ) save for the globular clusters with the longest relaxation time . while clear evidence of different radial distribution for different stellar generations has been found in a few cases ( e.g. , @xmath4 cen , sollima et al .",
    "2005 , bellini et al .",
    "2010 ; ngc  1851 , zoccali et al .",
    "2009 , carretta et al . 2010d ; ngc  3201 , carretta et al . 2010e ; and several other globular clusters , lardo et al .",
    "2011 ) , the extant data are not sufficient to give firm conclusions on most clusters ( see carretta et al .",
    "2009a ) .",
    "another common requirement is that of dilution of polluting gas with unprocessed material , necessary to reproduce all the observed ranges of abundances ; it also naturally accounts for the fact that some residual gas must be found in early globular clusters , since the efficiency of star formation can not be 100% .",
    "prantzos et al .",
    "( 2007 ) noted that the extreme abundances in ngc  6752 could be reproduced only after mixing the polluting matter with 30% of unprocessed material , with different dilution factors accounting for other less extreme variations .",
    "dilution with pristine material may help explaining the li abundances , e.g. why second generation stars with extreme processing are not devoid of li in ngc  6752 ( pasquini et al . 2005 ) .",
    "required for the frms scenario , the dilution is a _ mandatory _",
    "ingredient for the very same survival of the agb scenario . until recently ,",
    "the dilution argument was used only to reproduce the typical shape of the anticorrelations , as for the massive star scenario . in some particular cases ,",
    "notably ngc  1851 , it was postulated to fine tune the agb pollution and reproduce the difference in c+n+o required to explain the double sgb without a large he content ( excluded by the ms and hb properties , see ventura et al .",
    "however , dercole et al . ( 2011 ) and dantona et al . (",
    "2011 ) clearly state that the nucleosynthesis of agb models actually predict that na and o _ correlate _ , at odds with all observed chemical patterns in globular clusters .",
    "the only way to reconcile the observation with theory is to invoke an early - but not - too - early , see below - dilution of the agb ejecta with pristine gas .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to gather the pristine matter required for dilution : gas left from early star formation , bondi accretion and gas sweeping from the proto - cluster orbiting a gas - rich ancestral galaxy ( conroy & spergel 2010 ) , self pollution by wind of first generation stars less massive than polluters ( gratton & carretta 2010 ) , and material collapsing back from a torus left behind by a bi - conic , collimated gas sweeping generated by supernovae in the proto - cluster ( dercole et al .",
    "most of these are critically discussed in dercole et al .",
    "in particular , if the start of dilution is simultaneous to that of pollution , the related models ( conroy & spergel ; gratton & carretta ) are discarded , because in the model by dercole et al . the only way to produce the extreme component of second generation stars is by means of pure massive agb ejecta . in this case , however , a correlation between na and o should be observed .",
    "of course , this last requirement does not hold in the case of frms , thanks to the more favourable nucleosynthesis , able to reach even very high he enrichment values ( up to y=0.40 and more , decressin et al .",
    "2007b ) even in presence of some dilution .",
    "the distinctly separated mss observed in @xmath4  cen and ngc  2808 put serious constraints on dilution and polluters .",
    "the clear separation implies that within each sequence the matter is homogeneous , both in he and in fe .",
    "a neat separation was deemed impossible by renzini ( 2008 ) for frms forming second generation stars around each massive first generation star . however , these distinct sequences are only observed in these two massive clusters ( see however sect .  [ ms ] ) and the latest version of the frms scenario predicts a gathering of polluted gas in the generic centre of the globular cluster ( decressin et al .",
    "a study of discreteness vs continuous distribution in other globular clusters would help to clarify this question .",
    "we can , for instance , study the nature of the na - o anticorrelation to find whether first generation and second generation are distributed smoothly or are confined into discrete clumps . although the samples by carretta et al .",
    "( 2009a ) are quite large , the errors associated with the abundances derived from giraffe spectra are not sufficiently small for this kind of analysis . a few sparse studies , e.g. marino et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for m  4 , seem to indicate a separation between the two stellar generations , but the road is still open to many interpretations",
    ".      some scenarios for globular cluster formation may be quite easily modified to reproduce features observed at the high - mass end of globular cluster mass distribution , notably for the two most massive known milky way globular clusters , both with a cosmic scatter in fe abundances : @xmath4 cen ( from freeman & rodgers 1975 ; butler et al .",

    "2008 ; carretta et al .",
    "2010b , f ) .",
    "the observed intrinsic spread in fe abundances calls for repeated and large bursts of star formation in these clusters , where all the available range in stellar masses does contribute to the nucleosynthesis . the strong resemblance with the behaviour observed in local dwarfs ( see tolstoy et al .",
    "2009 ) led some authors ( e.g. , bekki & freeman 2003 ; bekki et al . 2007 ; bker 2008 ; carretta et al .",
    "2010b , f ) to suggest that massive globular clusters had their initial evolution in the core of dwarf galaxies . in both these cases the na - o anticorrelation is present at different metallicities , and always with a larger extension in the metal - intermediate component ( see sect .",
    "[ nucleosynthesis ] ) : the most heavily polluted stars belong to this component .",
    "these observations can be reconciled with a general scenario if the burst of star formation generating the metal - rich component was delayed by as much as 10 - 30 myr , so that their core collapse supernovae inject a notable energy input , disturbing and even suppressing the pollution from high mass stars in the ( spatially nearby ? ) metal - poor component ( e.g. , carretta et al .",
    "2010f ) .",
    "another possible variant of the last scenario resumes the idea ( e.g. , van den bergh 1996 ) that beside the large , massive globular clusters spiralling to the centre of their own galaxy , finding only a diffuse nuclear component ( m  54 and possibly @xmath4 cen ) , another channel is feasible : the merger of two originally distinct globular clusters in the same ancestral galaxy before the disruption within the galaxy ( carretta et al .",

    "2011a ) in the peculiar cluster ngc  1851 , characterised by a small difference of fe and a larger spread in ba , positively correlated with metallicity , as the enhancement in @xmath23process elements is higher in the more metal - rich component . in this population",

    "the solution probably resides in the feedback of star formation ( see e.g. , the discussion in wadepuhl & springel 2011 ) , although other solutions have been proposed ( e.g. , macci et al . 2010 ) .",
    "it is then clearly of interest to probe the earliest phases of the milky way building up by using the fossil records left by these past events , such as the composition and dynamics of the oldest and most metal - poor stellar components .",
    "we review here the work done recently on the connection between globular clusters and the halo ( see helmi 2008 for a recent review of the halo properties , and brodie & stadler 2006 for a review of the properties of globular cluster systems in galaxies ) .    that the present - day clusters are ( much ) less massive than at the time of formation is common wisdom , apart from the requirements dictated by the multi - population nature of globular clusters .",
    "a large fraction of stars should be lost in the very initial phase of globular cluster evolution through violent relaxation following gas expulsion and mass loss from the most massive stars ( e.g. , baumgardt et al .",
    "2008 ) . on a",
    "much longer timescale , a significant fraction of stars should evaporate : two - body encounters ( e.g. , mclaughlin & fall 2008 ) and other mechanisms ( such as disk shocking : see e.g. , aguilar et al .",

    "some fraction of the stars should be removed from the cluster within a relaxation time , typically @xmath56  yr ( see the compilation by harris 1996 ) .",
    "a substantial fraction of the original globular cluster mass should then have been lost , more efficiently among smaller globular clusters which have shorter relaxation times .",

    "; de marchi et al . 2007 ; de marchi & pulone 2007 ) .",
    "since these processes may lead to cluster dissolution on a timescale comparable to the lifetime of the globular clusters ( see e.g. , lamers et al .",

    "the lack of knowledge about the properties of the original distribution of globular clusters , of the environmental condition ( see elmegreen 2010 ) , and the subtleties of models of mass loss from globular clusters ( see e.g. , kruijssen 2009 and references therein ) prevent an accurate estimate of the original total mass of globular clusters ( see however baumgardt et al .",

    "( 2010a ) , and bekki ( 2011 ) were able to place the properties of different stellar generations in globular clusters and global cluster parameters into a general framework for the formation of globular clusters .",
    "the resulting scenario is one where probably _ all _ globular clusters , and not only the most massive ones ( see carretta et al .",
    "2010a ; kravtsov & gnedin 2005 ; bker 2008 ) , formed at the centre of larger systems .",
    "these were similar to the cosmological fragments that were the starting points for the assembly of dsphs , but the precursors of currently observed globular clusters probably started their evolution much closer to the central regions of the milky way , and the interaction between them and the whole galaxy occurred before the chemo - dynamical evolution of these objects could proceed up to the expulsion of most of its gas content .",
    "this agrees well with numerical simulations ( bekki & chiba 2001 ; boley et al . 2009 ; elmegreen 2010 ) and leads to several main consequences : ( i ) globular clusters populate regions much closer to the centre of the galaxy than dsphs ; ( ii ) globular clusters lost their dark matter content , and have low mass - to - light ratios , while dsphs are dark matter dominated objects ( e.g. , darbinghausen et al . 2008 ) ; ( iii ) for this reason , globular clusters are compact , tidally limited objects , while the luminous component of dsphs is more diffuse and occupies only the central part of their dark matter halo ; ( iv ) since dsphs evolved substantially as isolated objects , their evolution is dominated by their total mass , and they obey to mass - luminosity and mass - metallicity relations ( kirby et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this is not true for globular clusters ( see discussion in gratton 2008 ) .",
    "although largely qualitative , this scenario is self - consistent and is able to reproduce many observed characteristics of globular clusters .",
    "attempts to put this scenario on more quantitative basis have been made by dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 , 2011 ) and bekki ( 2011 ) .",
    "these models are exploring various relevant questions , including the formation of the cooling flow , the interaction between the cluster and the interstellar medium , etc .",
    "on the other hand , vesperini et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) explored the following evolution of the clusters , and showed that many properties of the globular cluster sub - populations can be reproduced by these models ( concentration , binary fraction , etc . ) .",
    "a major question is whether a ( even large ) part of the galactic field stars were formed in clusters and are now a main component of the halo .",
    "various authors proposed infant cluster mortality as the major source of halo stars ( e.g. , baumgardt et al . 2008 ) .",
    "although globular clusters currently represent only @xmath58% of the mass of the galactic halo ( gratton et al .",
    "2011b , see next section ; a higher estimate of @xmath59% was given by freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) , this suggestion has recently received renewed interest because it is now clear that the bulk of stars in globular clusters belongs to the second generation ( carretta et al . 2009a , b ) .",
    "this population is typical of globular clusters ( gratton et al . 2000 ) , so that its main signature , the na - o anticorrelation , might be also considered the true tracer of a _ bona fide _ globular cluster .",
    "the small fraction ( about 2.5% ) of na - rich and/or cn - rich stars in the field halo ( carretta et al . 2010a ; martell & grebel 2010 ) may well come from second generation stars evaporated from globular clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "a residual of the first generation is still present in globular clusters but only as a minority component ( about one third ) of the current total population . to reproduce correctly the ratio of first generation to second generation and the observed chemical features , a large fraction of stars of the first generation ( more than 90% ) must have been lost from globular clusters ( see e.g. decressin et al . 2008 ; dercole et al .",
    "2008 , 2011 ; and references in carretta et al . 2010a ) .    in the remaining of this section , we discuss in more detail the possible relation between the first generation in globular clusters and the field halo stars .",
    "gratton et al . ( 2011b ) estimated that , if reference is made to the same volume , that is , the region of the galaxy dominated by the galactic halo , about 1.2% of the halo stars are currently in globular clusters .",
    "while this value has a considerable uncertainty , it may be considered as a conservative estimate . as mentioned above",
    ", the original fraction of stars in globular clusters should have been larger because they are expected to lose a significant part of their stars during their evolution . for reasonable initial conditions ,",
    "the rates of evaporation of first generation and second generation stars were likely different only in very early phases , within two relaxation times ( vesperini et al .",
    "2010 ; decressin et al . 2008 , 2010 )",
    "let us assume for simplicity that they lost stars at the same rate after second generation stars formed .",
    "if we then adopt the value cited above of 2.5% of second generation stars now present in the general field , and the present ratio of first generation to second generation stars , we deduce that the fraction of stars that belonged to globular clusters at the end of the formation of the second generation is 3.7% of the current halo stars .",
    "since currently 1.2% of the halo mass is still in globular clusters , at that epoch they were four times more massive than they are now and that about 5% of the halo was in globular clusters .",
    "a similar argument may be found in schaerer & charbonnel ( 2011 ) .    however , as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ scenarios ] , the mass involved in the process of formation of globular clusters was likely significantly larger than their mass after formation of the second generation .",
    "several authors ( bekki et al .",
    "2007 ; dercole et al . 2008 , 2010",
    "; decressin et al . 2008 ; vesperini et al .",
    "2010 ; carretta et al . 2010a",
    "; martell & grebel 2010 ; gratton & carretta 2010 ; conroy 2011 ; schaerer & charbonnel 2011 ; bekki 2011 ) provided estimates of the initial mass of the primordial population of globular clusters required to satisfy the above constraint . in spite of different assumptions , they all agree on very large ratios ( from 10 up to 25 ) between the original first generation population and the globular cluster stars after formation of the second generation .",
    "the original proto - globular clusters should then have included @xmath60% of the halo mass .",
    "this value further rises if part of the mass lost by the potential polluters was not used to form second generation stars .",
    "there is then a strong argument suggesting that the primordial stars of the current globular cluster were responsible for a large fraction , possibly the majority of the current field halo stars , although a contribution by dsph s , mainly to the outer halo , is certainly present ( see the discussion in helmi 2008 ) .",
    "furthermore , if we consider that the total number of globular clusters per unit halo mass does not depend strongly on the magnitude or hubble type of the host galaxy ( bekki et al .",
    "2008 ) we can conclude that the massive star - formation episodes producing globular clusters played a very important role in the formation of stars in galaxies , and might have substantially contributed to the reionisation of the universe at @xmath61  ( ricotti 2002 ; schaerer & charbonnel 2011 ) .        .",
    "the order - of - magnitude estimates of the previous section suggest that a large fraction of the milky way stellar halo is formed by debris of proto - clusters .",
    "this result is supported by the good agreement , especially for the inner halo , between the metallicity distribution of halo globular clusters ( data from the harris 1996 catalogue ) and of the milky way halo , as determined from in situ observations ( ivezic et al .",

    "for instance , the overabundance of @xmath63elements with respect to fe has been used to conclude that the majority of field halo stars can not have formed in objects such as present - day dsph s ( see shetrone et al .",

    "second generation stars clearly differ concerning the abundances of the elements involved in high temperature h - burning , as we have seen throughout this review .",
    "the radial distribution of halo globular clusters matches well the distribution of halo stars ( brodie & strader 2006 ; baumgardt et al .",
    "2008 ; helmi 2008 ) . to further show this ,",
    "we first estimated the run of the density of stars within globular clusters with galactocentric distance @xmath62 .",
    "this was done by ordering the halo globular clusters according to increasing @xmath62 ( see appendix in carretta et al .",
    "this allows us to define a shell pertinent to each globular cluster , defined by its @xmath62 and the same value for the globular cluster immediately preceding .",
    "we then estimated the density of globular cluster stars in this shell by dividing the mass within each globular cluster ( simply using an average @xmath64 ) for the volume of the shell .",
    "the run of this density is plotted against @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ f : density ] , together with the best fit line and that representing the slope of the density appropriate for the inner halo , according to juric et al .",
    "( 2008 ; see also harris 1976 and morrison 1993 , and the review by helmi 2008 for a thorough discussion and words of caution about the meaning of such an average value ) .",
    "this second line represents a good fit for the inner halo , while the density slope for globular cluster is clearly steeper in the outer halo .",
    "these slopes agree fairly well with the predictions given by numerical simulations by steinmetz & muller ( 1995 ) , bekki & chiba ( 2001 ) , and bullock & johnston ( 2005 ) .",
    "an assessment of the properties of the hb is fundamental in order to properly understand the relation existing between globular cluster and field halo population .",
    "at least three parameters ( metallicity , age , and possibly he abundance ) are required to explain the properties of the hb population in globular clusters ( see sect .",
    "since it is not obvious that the distribution of these parameters is the same for field and cluster stars , it could be possible to observe systematic differences between their hb populations .",
    "it is difficult to extract clean samples of field hb stars to be used for this comparison .",
    "the best results are obtained for blue hb stars and rr lyrae ( e.g. , kinman & allen 1996 ) , while it is difficult to obtain a complete sample of red hb stars . here , we only limit the discussion to the first ones",
    ".        reliable samples of bhb stars have been obtained by extensive spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , beers et al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ) , which provided colour distribution of bhb stars strongly peaked at colours in the range @xmath65 with very few bluer stars ( kinman & allen , 1996 ; brown et al .",
    "brown et al . used these data to infer the luminosity function of field bhb . in fig .",
    "[ f : bhb ] we compare their luminosity function with that for bhb stars in globular clusters obtained using the hst  snapshot survey \" ( piotto et al . 2003 ) .",
    "roughly half of the cluster bhbs are fainter than @xmath66 , while there is virtually no field bhb star fainter than this magnitude .",
    "this confirms the earlier result by kinman & allen ( 1996 ) : field and cluster bhb luminosity functions are different , the first one lacking the extension at faint magnitudes that has to have an origin strictly tied to the globular cluster environment .",
    "since there are few na - rich / o - poor stars in the field , this difference can be immediately related to the correlation existing between the maximum temperature of hb stars and the extension of the na - o anticorrelation ( carretta et al .",
    "2007 , 2010a ) .",
    "the maximum temperature of the hb for the field stars at @xmath67  corresponds to an interquartile of the na - o distribution @xmath68 , which is close to the minimum value obtained for any globular cluster ( see carretta et al .",
    "if the relation between the blue tails of the hb and the presence of na - rich stars is caused by a difference in the he content ( dantona et al .",
    "2002 ; gratton et al . 2010a",
    "; see sect .",
    "[ hb ] ) , he - rich stars are rare in the field , while they are quite common in globular clusters .",
    "this fact supports the view that field halo stars are related almost completely to the primordial ( na- and he - poor ) population of globular clusters , that is the first generation .",
    "a significant fraction ( @xmath69% ) of solar type stars in the solar neighbourhood are in binary systems ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) .",
    "wide binaries may be destroyed in very dense fields ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , the outcome of the interactions between a binary and single stars in a cluster depends critically on the ratio @xmath70  of the binary binding energy to the mean kinetic energy of cluster stars . in general , binaries having @xmath71  ( hard / close binaries ) will , on average , become more bound as a result of interactions with single stars ; for @xmath72  ( soft / wide binaries ) , binary / single - star interactions will generally lead to the disruption of the binary ( see e.g. , heggie & hut 2003 for a review ) . the binary frequency and the maximum separation",
    "may then be used to estimate the density of the birth environment ( goodwin 2010 ) .",
    "the frequency of spectroscopic binaries among field metal - poor red giants , for periods less than 6000 days , is @xmath73% , which is not significantly different from that measured for field metal - poor dwarfs ( @xmath74% : carney et al . 2003 ) .",
    "these values are similar to those obtained for field population i stars , if we restrict to the same period range .",
    "binary stars play a crucial role in cluster evolution , both as an energy source supporting the cluster s post - core collapse dynamics ( see e.g. gao et al .",
    "1991 ; goodman & hut 1989 ; vesperini & chernoff 1994 ; heggie et al . 2006 ; trenti et al . 2007 ; hurley et al . 2007 ;",
    "see also heggie & hut 2003 for a review ) , and as potential seeds for the formation of a variety of exotic objects ( e.g. lmxbs , cvs , blue stragglers etc . ; see e.g. ivanova et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ; ferraro & lanzoni 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "however , the binary fraction in globular clusters is certainly much lower than in the field ( romani & weinberg 1991 ) . in a recent survey of photometric binaries deduced from the colour - magnitude diagram , milone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimated that typically only a few per cent of stars in globular clusters are binaries , with the binary fraction being a strong function of the cluster mass , ranging from @xmath59% for the most massive globular clusters , up to @xmath55% for the less massive ones .",
    "the mass weighted average value is low , at most about one third of that for field halo stars .",
    "the low binary fraction in globular cluster is not surprising considering their high density ; the larger fraction of wide binaries among the halo stars indicates that they did not originate within globular clusters which subsequently disintegrated , but formed in less dense environments ( ryan 1992 ) .",
    "however , an intriguing result is that the incidence of binaries is very different among first generation and second generation stars ( see dorazi et al .",
    "2010a ) . in these samples ( drawn from the outer regions of the globular clusters , where the fraction of binaries is lower through mass segregation effects ,",
    "see milone et al .",
    "2008 ) , only @xmath54% of second generation stars are in binary systems , while the fraction of spectroscopic binaries in first generation ( @xmath75% ) is similar to that observed in field metal - poor stars , i.e. , it is consistent with the close relation we are proposing between first generation and field halo stars .",
    "this result is fully consistent with that obtained by milone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , if we assume that there are no long period binaries in globular clusters ( which is reasonable ) , and if we consider that first generation makes up only one third of the globular cluster population .",
    "the dramatic difference between the frequency of binaries in first generation and second generation indicates ( i ) that most of the destruction of binaries ( or lack of formation ) among second generation stars occurred before relaxation of the system , because we do not expect large differences in the destruction rates between first generation and second generation later ; and ( ii ) that only the most compact binaries have a significant probability to form or survive in the very dense regions where second generation stars of globular cluster formed .",
    "vesperini et al .",
    "( 2011 ) were able to model successfully these results in the hypothesis that second generation stars formed a compact subsystem in the central regions of a more extended first generation globular cluster as proposed in different forms in dercole et al .",

    "( 2010 ) , bekki ( 2011 ) , and caloi & dantona ( 2011 ) .",

    "this is a crucial ingredient in models of globular cluster formation and evolution , and should have important consequences on the dynamical models .",
    "summarizing , we presented several arguments to show how the fraction of the first generation stars lost by globular clusters may be considered one of main building block of the halo , although other minor contributors can not be excluded .",
    "these arguments include their total mass , the metallicity distribution , the element - to - element abundance ratios , the location within the milky way , the distribution of hb stars , and the binary fraction .",
    "if true , this connection establishes a close relationship between the formation of globular clusters and that of the halo : a large fraction of the halo stars formed in the same episodes which ultimately lead to the formation of the globular clusters , and therefore should have a similar age . on the other hand ,",
    "the connection is much looser between metal - rich globular clusters and the thick disk , since the specific frequency of globular clusters is reduced by roughly a factor of ten in this case .",
    "this suggests that thick disk stars typically formed in a large number of smaller episodes of star formation .",
    "in this review we have presented an update on our knowledge of the multiple populations in globular clusters .",
    "the phenomenon moved from being generally considered an exotic curiosity , present only in a few , peculiar clusters ( such as e.g. , @xmath4  cen , ngc  2808 , m  22 ) , to a feature attributed only to massive clusters ( the ones mentioned above , plus m  54 or ngc  6388 ) , and finally to the widespread acceptance of its probable universality ( at least among clusters massive enough , such as the milky way globular clusters ) .",
    "we can not fully understand the intrinsic properties of globular clusters , their formation , and their interaction with the milky way , unless we are able to quantitatively define the properties of the multiple populations in globular clusters , using a manifold of information coming from spectroscopy , photometry , and theoretical modelling .",
    "recent progress in gathering extensive , high quality observational samples from both spectroscopy and photometry are now allowing to successfully attack long standing problems such as the second - parameter problem or the relation between globular clusters and field halo .",
    "many questions remain still open in understanding how globular cluster formed . the most critical concern the relative roles of the different mechanisms that may cause inhomogeneities in globular clusters , the nature of the polluters ( which sets the timescale ) and clarification of all nucleosynthesis mechanisms involved , the origin of the diluting material , and the construction of reliable 3-d hydrodynamical models .    while theoretical models have made substantial progress and should continue , maybe the theory is still lagging behind observations and is unlikely that most of these questions will be solved without new inputs . here , still important progress",
    "can be obtained by pursuing the _ archaeological _ approach of studying old systems that provided most of the evidence available .",
    "in particular , spectroscopy can be used to explore the abundance pattern for those elements , such as he , li , al , and f , whose potential has not been fully exploited ; or to obtain an accurate set of abundances for large sets of stars in each cluster , in order to study the shape of the distributions ( continuous _ vs _ discrete ) or the connection with kinematics or location within the clusters .",
    "photometry may provide both large samples of stars and high accuracy for many more globular clusters .",
    "all these studies may likely be conducted with currently available instrumentation , at least for milky way globular clusters , while possibly new instruments are required to study the extragalactic ones .    on the other hand , detailed study of star formation histories in large star forming regions and massive young clusters",
    "may also turn out to be very profitable ; thus , it should be intensified and systematically pursued .",
    "most of the interesting objects are in other galaxies , and require very high quality observational material , possibly adaptive optics assisted observations and integral field spectroscopy .",
    "studies of the interstellar matter in these large star - forming regions with large millimetric arrays such as alma might also be interesting to reveal the same existence of the cooling flows predicted in globular cluster formation scenarios .",
    "however , when considering young objects , it should be clear that there must be something fundamentally different in how formation of massive clusters proceeded in the _ halo _ and how is going on in _ disk - like _ environments : basic evidence for this is given by the different specific frequency of globular cluster in the two environments and the universal presence of clearly separated blue and red sequences of globular clusters in galaxies ( see the review by brodie & strader 2006 ) .",
    "ideally , the connection between globular clusters , their multiple populations , and the galactic halo should be explored by directly detecting the streams formed by the individual globular clusters .",
    "this can not be done at present because of the short dynamical timescales in the inner galaxy ( a typical inner halo star will have made between 50 and 100 revolutions in a hubble time ) .",
    "each accreted satellite will then give rise to multiple streams ( see helmi & white 1999 ; and discussion in helmi 2008 ) .",
    "better perspectives are opened by studying streams in the integral of motion space ( helmi et al .",
    "1999 ; kepley et al .",
    "this requires determining the kinematics of a large number of halo stars .",
    "some progress in the field is expected in the near future from the continuing segue ( beers et al .",
    "2006 ; yanny et al . 2009 ) and rave ( steinmetz et al .",
    "2006 ; siebert et al .",
    "2011 ) surveys .",
    "further data will be produced by spectroscopic surveys just starting or planned for the immediate future , such as hermes ( freeman 2011 ) , lamost ( e.g. , zhao et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the flames public eso survey ( pis gilmore and randich , see http://www.gaia-eso.eu ) that will start in 2012 and will target more than 10@xmath76 stars belonging to all galactic stellar components .",
    "finally , a special role will be played by the gaia satellite ( perryman et al .",
    "2001 ) , due to be launched in mid-2013 , with its all - sky information on position , distance , and proper motion for about 10@xmath77 objects , and complete information ( radial velocity , metallicity ) for a few million stars ( see http://www.rssd.esa.int ) .",
