    "it means that we have to deal with a complex theoretical problem involving many emitters , many levels and many modes . to reduce the complexity ,",
    "semi - classical theories have been developed and utilized , for example , rate equations @xcite and maxwell - bloch equations @xcite . because of the mean - field approximations involved , these theories , however , yield no statistical information about the the lasing modes and thus advanced full quantum laser theories are needed .",
    "unfortunately , so far those quantum theories treat the emitters as identical two - level systems @xcite and are thus incapable of dealing with randomly distributed emitters .",
    "most existing theories can be viewed as effective descriptions , where the emitters are treated only in an average sense .",
    "they can reproduce main characteristics measured in experiments because the inhomogeneity of the emitters becomes irrelevant if huge amounts of them are involved .",
    "however , this may not be the case in the plasmonic nano - laser .",
    "because of the strong inhomogeneous subwavelength distribution of the near - field in the nano - laser , the spatial distribution of emitters can significantly affect how they convert the pumping energy into the plasmon energy and even determine whether the systems can achieve lasing or not . by analyzing this influence",

    ", we summarize our findings and present an outlook for future work .",
    "as indicated by fig.[fig : scheme - three - level ] ( a ) , we consider a random arrangement of molecular emitters separated by more than @xmath12 nm from the surface of a gold nano - sphere of 10 nm radius .",
    "the separation guarantees that electron tunneling is suppressed @xcite and the molecule - mnp coupling is dominated by coulomb coupling .",
    "the molecules are assumed to be resonant with the dipole plasmons of the sphere .",
    "the higher multipole plasmons have minor influence on the system @xcite and contribute only as an off - resonant reservoir to the excited - state decay rate of the molecules @xcite .      for a nano - sphere ,",
    "there are three degenerate dipole plasmon modes with transition dipole moments pointing along three orthogonal axes .",

    "these modes can be described as quantum harmonic oscillators with hamiltonian @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are creation and annihilation operators and @xmath18 is their excitation energy @xcite .",
    "we describe the molecules as three - level systems with the internal energy level scheme and transitions shown in fig.1(b ) .",

    ". these equations result in dependence between the plasmon rdm and the correlations , shown in fig . [",

    "this dependence also indicates our procedure to solve those inter - dependent equations : because both molecular and plasmonic dissipation rates contribute to the decay of the correlations , they must decay faster and thus may adiabatically @xcite follow the plasmon rdm elements which are only affected by the plasmon damping . because of the molecular dissipation , the correlations represented within the blue dashed box of fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme - three - level](c ) depend on the correlations outside the box .",
    "fortunately , they all can be expressed as functions of the plasmon rdm because of the symmetry hidden in the coupling hamiltonians . finally , we back substitute these expressions and obtain closed dynamic equations for the plasmon rdm , where the molecules contribute by several coefficients , cf .",

    "[ sec : derviation - plasmon - rdm ] .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath57 are the populations ( the probabilities ) of the plasmon number states @xmath58 while the off - diagonal elements @xmath8 ( @xmath59 ) represent the coherence of the plasmons . here",

    "@xmath65 for @xmath66 indicates @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath66 and @xmath69 denotes @xmath70 .",
    "since the former rates decrease the population of higher plasmon states but increase that of lower states , they can be interpreted as molecule - induced plasmon damping rates .",
    "since the latter rates have the opposite effect on the population , they can be interpreted as molecule - induced plasmon pumping rates .",
    "the latter rates depend on two plasmon mode indices and thus account for correlation between different plasmon modes induced by the molecules .",
    "these rates can be considered as extended einstein s ab coefficients accounting for the multi - plasmon modes , the molecular pumping mechanism and the molecular inhomogeneity .    at steady - state the second line of eq .",
    "is recovered if we replace @xmath71 by @xmath72 on the right side of the first line , which suggests a recursion relation of the populations .",
    "we obtain such a relation by setting the first line to zero : @xmath73 together with the normalization condition @xmath74 , the above relation can be utilized to easily calculate the populations according to the procedure outlined in fig . [",
    "fig : procedure ] in appendix [ sec : derviation - plasmon - rdm ] .",
    "although @xmath75 contains all the information about the three dipole plasmons , it is more intuitive to consider physical quantities related to one or two dipole plasmon .",
    "we calculate them by tracing out one mode to get @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( the joint population of two modes ) or by tracing out two modes to get @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( the reduced population of one mode ) .",
    "we can also quantify the strength of plasmon excitation with the so - called plasmon mean numbers : @xmath82 and the plasmon statistics with the so - called ( steady - state ) second order correlation functions : @xmath83 . to analyze how the individual molecule contributes to the plasmon excitation",

    "eqs . , and in appendix [ sec : collection - population ] .",
    "the above theoretical model provides clues about how the molecular inhomogeneity may affect the system performance .",
    "the molecular inhomogeneity mainly originates from their positions and orientations of their transition dipole moments , which leads to that all the molecules interact with the three modes simultaneously but with random strengths .",

    "[ fig : single - plasmon - mode](d ) .",
