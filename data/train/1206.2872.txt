    "single electron tunneling ( set ) devices@xcite are promising candidates for a wide variety of nanoelectronics applications , such as sensitive electrometers@xcite , thermometers@xcite , electron pumps and turnstiles for current standards@xcite , and quantum bits for quantum information processing@xcite . in recent years",
    ", silicon has drawn a lot of attention as a candidate for practical set devices for several reasons .",
    "these advantages include compatibility with complementary metal  oxide  semiconductor ( cmos ) processing , good electrostatic control of the tunnel barriers@xcite , greater device stability as demonstrated by a lack of charge offset drift@xcite , and a relative lack of nuclear spins , an important source of decoherence in spin - based quantum information applications@xcite .",
    "however , to become truly viable in any of these applications , devices must be fabricated which overcome the device to device variations and low yield associated with the single device processing typical of small  scale research programs .",
    "although , at the single device level , the gate voltage variation from one device to another may not be an important parameter , uniform device operation becomes crucial when trying to operate several set devices simultaneously , e.g. , in the large scale integration of set devices .",
    "the choice of device architecture can also impact the integrability of devices .",
    "for example , gate to gate variations in an architecture where more than one gate@xcite controls a single tunnel barrier can make finding the desired operating point a laborious iterative process .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate robust behavior and good unformity of easily - tuned , fully cmos single electron devices , which contain only silicon , thermally  grown silicon dioxide ( sio@xmath3 ) and phorphorous  doped polycrystalline silicon ( poly  si ) in the active device region .",
    "the motivation for a fully cmos approach to fabrication is twofold : 1 ) to minimize the number of impurities and defects near the active device region and 2 ) to avoid the instabilities associated with metallic oxides and , in particular , aluminum oxide . in this way , we avail ourselves of the best opportunity to fabricate uniform , robust devices .",
    "below , we will discuss and demonstrate the robustness of our devices with respect to basic metal  oxide  semiconductor field ",
    "effect transistor ( mosfet ) characteristics and set device operation . in particular , we show that these devices exhibit only small variations of the threshold voltage from device to device , dielectrics which are robust against breakdown , and charge offset stability of the order of 0.01 e over a period of several days .",

    "our devices each contain a lightly boron  doped ( p  type ) mesa  etched single crystal si nanowire , n@xmath6type source and drain , and two layers of gates ; see fig .",
    "[ sample ] ( a ) . the topmost gate layer , which we call the upper gate ( ug ) , covers the entire device between the heavily doped source and drain .",
    "applying a positive voltage to the upper gate inverts the underlying si nanowire and provides conduction .",
    "the second gate layer , which we call the lower gates ( lg ) , consists of three finger gates which wrap around the si nanowire .",
    "these are denoted as lgs ( closest to the source ) , lgc ( center gate ) and lgd ( closest to the drain ) ; see fig .",
    "[ sample ] ( b ) .",
    "the lower gate fingers are primarily used to locally deplete the electron gas and therefore to create electrostatically controlled tunnel barriers ( lgs and lgd ) , or to modulate the electrostatic potential of a quantum dot ( lgc ) .",
    "the devices are fabricated on a 6 inch silicon  on  insulator ( soi ) wafer , with doping density of about 10@xmath7 @xmath8 , an initial soi thickness of 100 nm , and a buried oxide ( box ) thickness of 200 nm . to minimize the interface trap density at the gate oxide interface of the nanowire@xcite",
    ", we fabricate the soi nanowires at a 45@xmath9 angle with respect to the flat ( @xmath10110@xmath11 ) of the wafer in order to obtain a @xmath10100@xmath11 crystallographic equivalent orientation on each facet of the nanowire .",

    "[ sample ] ( b ) shows a schematic of a typical measurement circuit for a device .",
    "tuning the device to display set oscillations took very little time , on the order of minutes , because there was very little cross capacitance between gates and each barrier was controlled by a single gate voltage . to tune a device into set mode",
    ", we first applied a small bias voltage to the drain ( of order 1 mv ) and set the upper gate to a voltage ( obtained from a short upper gate sweep , typically about 2 v ) which gave about 1 na of current .",

    "the oscillations were very regular with period of 12.9 mv over an lgc gate voltage range of 1.2 v , corresponding to about 90 periods .",

    "[ diamonds ] . the charging energy and lever arm @xmath34 , which converts the gate voltage to the electrostatic potential of the island @xmath35 , extracted from the diamond data were 1.2 mev and 0.09 , respectively .",
    "the capacitance between the dot and each of the other two lower gates ( lgs and lgd ) was measured relative to the lgc capacitance by following the position of a current peak when sweeping lgs ( or lgd ) and lgc ( data not shown ) .",
    "the capacitance values for both lgs and lgd were about 5 af , indicating the dot was located in the center of the device .",
    "this , together with the agreement between the measured capacitance to lgc ( 12 af ) and that calculated from the geometry ( 14 af ) gives us confidence that the dot being modulated was an intentional dot formed through electrostatic control of lgs and lgd rather than through barriers formed by defects .    as a more strict test of the quality of our fabrication we performed charge offset drift measurements on several devices .",
    "this measurement consisted of repeatedly measured coulomb blockade oscillations at a fixed time interval over several days .",
    "figure [ cbdata ] ( a ) shows a typical collection of set oscillations taken at 2.2 k and spanning the total duration of the charge offset drift measurement . to obtain charge offset drift values for each curve , a sinusoidal function of the form @xmath36 $ ] was fit to the measured data . here",

    "[ cbdata ] ( b ) . the devices exhibited very stable behavior with a drift in @xmath41 e over 8 days of measurement .",
    "moreover , these results rival those of similar si devices fabricated in other foundries@xcite .",
    "in addition , after eight days of measurement , we thermally cycled the device to room temperature .",
    "figure [ cbdata ] shows this data as well .",
    "while the thermal cycle resulted in a shift in the charge offset value of about ( 0.1@xmath42 ) e , the level of drift observed was identical both before and after the thermal cycle .",
    "finally , a measurement of @xmath43 vs. @xmath33 voltage with the same lgs , lgd , and ug voltages after the thermal cycle not only reproduced the set oscillations at the same value @xmath33 with charge offset of 0.1 e , but also reproduced the aperiodic features which become prominent when the gate begins to turn off conduction ( inset of fig . [ cbdata ] ) .    while the previous results indicate that the cleanliness of our cmos fabrication is quite good , many devices in this first device run failed electrically by either not turning on or through an inability to turn off conduction with the lower gate fingers .",
    "this drove our yield of fully functioning ( in which we were able to measure intentional coulomb blockade ) devices down to 4/34 devices measured .",
    "we have been able to identify the gross fabrication failures , by cross - sectioning devices with fib in conjunction with the electrical results . in brief , the failure modes are the result of over  oxidation of the soi nanowire and the lg fingers , as well as the overall amount of oxide removed in the processing .",
    "we believe further development of our process flow will ameliorate these failures .",

    "all features in the data are reproduced after the thermal cycle . ]",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated devices which show good uniformity in electrical characteristics from device to device within a wafer and between wafers . moreover , the devices are quite robust against dielectric breakdown up to electric fields of 4 mv / cm .",
    "finally , and most importantly , when operated as a single electron device , these devices show very stable behavior . taken together ,",
    "these characteristics indicate a relatively clean and stable electrostatic environment throughout the fabrication process .",
    "we attribute these successes to the minimization of impurities and defects which result from our cmos processing and material restrictions . to further improve the usefulness of these devices as current standards and quantum information devices , our next tasks include i ) substantially increasing the yield , and ii ) making shorter finger gates so that we can use those gates to both generate barriers and as plunger gates .",
    "while these results indicate that a fully cmos process pays dividends in device performance , it also complicates the fabrication .",
