    "he intricate structure of many biological , social , and economic networks emerges as the result of local interactions between agents aiming to optimize their utilities .",
    "the emerging networked system must satisfy both structural and functional requirements , even in the presence of time - varying interactions .",
    "an important set of functional requirements is concerned with the behavior of dynamic processes taking place in the network .",
    "for example , most biological networks emerge as the result of an evolutive process that forces the network to be stable and robust to external perturbations .    among networks of dynamical systems , those consisting of positive systems ( i.e. , the state variables are nonnegative quantities provided the initial state and the inputs are nonnegative  @xcite ) are of particular importance .",
    "positive systems arise naturally while modeling systems in which the variables of interest are inherently nonnegative , such as concentration of chemical species  @xcite , information rates in communication networks  @xcite , sizes of infected populations in epidemiology  @xcite , and many other compartmental models  @xcite . due to its practical relevance",
    ", many control - theoretical tools have been adapted to the particular case of positive linear systems , such as the characterization of stability via diagonal lyapunov functions  @xcite , the bounded real lemma  @xcite , and integral linear constraints for robust stability  @xcite , to mention a few ( we point the reader to  @xcite , for a thorough exposition on positive systems ) .",
    "most of the methods mentioned above , however , focus on state - feedback control of positive linear systems .",
    "in contrast , there are many situations in which state - feedback is not a feasible option .",
    "a particular example is the stabilization of a viral spreading process in a complex contact network  @xcite , where it is not feasible to obtain reliable measurements about the state of the spread in ( almost ) real time . in this and similar situations ,",
    "the control problem is better posed as the problem of tuning the dynamics of the nodes and the coupling elements of the network in order to guarantee a stable dynamics .",
    "furthermore , existing control methods mostly focus on the analysis of time - invariant systems ; thus , they do not provide effective tools for designing time - switching topologies .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose a tractable optimization framework to design networked positive linear systems in the presence of time - switching topologies .",
    "we model the time variation of the network structure using markov processes , where the modes of the markov process correspond to different network structures and the transition rates indicate the probability of switching between topologies . in this context , we consider the problem of designing both the dynamics of the nodes in the network , as well as the structure of the elements coupling them in order to optimize the dynamic performance of the switching network .",
    "we model the cost of implementing a particular network dynamics using posynomial cost functions , which allow for a wide range of modeling option @xcite .",
    "we then propose an efficient optimization framework , based on geometric programming @xcite , to find the cost - optimal network design that maximizes the stabilization rate and/or the disturbance rejection against exogenous signals . to achieve this objective ,",
    "we develop new theoretical characterizations of the stabilization rate and the disturbance attenuation of positive markov jump linear systems which are specially amenable in the context of geometric programming .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : math ] , we introduce elements of graph theory , markov jump linear systems , and geometric programming used in our derivations . in section  [ sec : prbsetting ] , we model the dynamics of randomly switching network using markov jump linear systems and rigorously state the design problems under consideration . then",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose an optimization framework to design a network of positive linear systems whose structure switches according to a markov process . </S>",
    "<S> the optimization framework herein proposed allows the network designer to optimize the coupling elements of a directed network , as well as the dynamics of the nodes in order to maximize the stabilization rate of the network and/or the disturbance rejection against an exogenous input . </S>",
    "<S> the cost of implementing a particular network is modeled using posynomial cost functions , which allow for a wide variety of modeling options . in this context , we show that the cost - optimal network design can be efficiently found using geometric programming in polynomial time . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our results with a practical problem in network epidemiology , namely , the cost - optimal stabilization of the spread of a disease over a time - varying contact network . </S>"
