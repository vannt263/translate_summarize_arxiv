    "understanding the stellar content of early - type galaxies is fundamental to understanding their star formation and chemical evolution history .",
    "most early - type galaxies are too distant to resolve their individual stars with current technology , rendering the direct study of their stellar populations impossible .",
    "thus , their stellar populations must be studied using indirect methods .    in recent decades",
    ", significant effort has gone into trying to better constrain the stellar contents for early - type galaxies using optical spectroscopic data .",
    "the most commonly studied features have been ca i h and k 0.38 @xmath0 m , h@xmath4 , mgb 0.52 @xmath0 m , fe @xmath0 m 0.53 , na 0.82 @xmath0 m , and cat 0.86 @xmath0 m .",
    "interpretation of all such spectral features is intrinsically complicated by their blended nature ",
    "each feature is really the super - position of many spectral lines , usually from several different elements , blurred together by the line - of - sight velocity dispersion within each galaxy .",
    "there is no way to overcome this problem  it must simply be taken into account during analysis .",
    "as population synthesis models have become more sophisticated and digital stellar libraries more complete , this problem has become more tractable over time .",
    "another challenge arises from the composite nature of galaxies : each observed feature is the luminosity - weighted integrated sum of that feature from all stars in the observed line - of - sight .",
    "naturally , luminosity - weighted does not imply mass - weighted .",
    "a relatively small fraction of the mass can dominate the observed luminosity and mask the underlying stellar population ( e.g. as happens during a starburst event within a pre - existing galaxy ) .    even in relatively quiescent galaxies , light from stars at several important evolutionary stages contribute roughly equally to the observed spectral features between 0.4  1 @xmath0 m range .",
    "hence , a feature depth change could be due to ( e.g. ) a change near the ( mostly ) age - driven main - sequence turnoff or the ( mostly ) metallicity - driven red giant branch .",
    "the details can become quite complicated , as illustrated by the long standing controversy about whether observed changes in balmer line strength arise from the presence of younger main sequence stars , more metal - poor main sequence stars , or an extended horizontal giant branch ( for recent discussions of this debate , see maraston & thomas 2000 and trager et al .",
    "a similar controversy surrounds na 0.82 @xmath0 m feature : is it driven by metallicity - driven red giant branch changes , initial mass function related differences in the relative number of cool dwarf and giant stars or both ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "?    however , the properties of the rgb component can be isolated by observing in the k - band ( centered near 2.2 @xmath0 m ) . at those wavelengths , cool giants near the tip of the first - ascent red giant branch ( rgb )",
    "dominate the integrated light in old ( @xmath5 3 gyr ) stellar populations . in combination with optical observations",
    ", k - band observations should facilitate the separation of msto and rgb light contributions .",
    "there are two possible complications to this scenario .",
    "first , a very young stellar population containing red supergiants will contribute a significant fraction k - band light .",
    "fortunately , such a population is obvious from the presence of h  ii region emission lines at shorter wavelengths .",
    "second , a somewhat older population ( 1  2 gyr , i.e. an intermediate - age population ) may contain bolometrically bright carbon stars that can contribute a detectable amount of k - band light ( see discussions in silva & bothun 1998a , b ) .",
    "such a population may or may not be connected to increased h@xmath4 strength .",
    "initial development of these ideas can be found in silva et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , mobasher & james ( 1996 ) , james & mobasher ( 1999 ) , mobasher & james ( 2000 ) , all of whom focused on the co 2.36 @xmath0 m feature .",
    "origlia et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observed a si dominated feature at 1.59 @xmath0 m as well as co dominated features .",
    "these observational studies were limited by small - format detectors to relatively low resolving powers and/or small wavelength ranges per observation . in the cases of silva",
    "et al . and origlia et al . , only small , heterogeneous samples of galaxies were observed .",
    "a general conclusion of the james & mobasher studies was that changes in co strength between early - type galaxies in high - density and low - density regions were statistically consistent with different fraction contributions of intermediate - age agb light and hence galaxies in low - density regions had younger luminosity - weighted mean ages .",
    "origilia et al .",
    "argued that [ si / fe ] was super - solar in the four elliptical galaxies they observed .    to further develop these ideas and investigate the usefulness of other k - band spectral indices in the study of early - type galaxies ,",
    "new data have been obtained for eleven e / s0 galaxies in the nearby fornax cluster .",
    "only measurements in the central regions of these galaxies are discussed here . in section  [ sec : data ] , the galaxy sample and its observations are discussed , while in section  [ sec : proc ] the data processing methodology is described . the measurement of spectral feature strength is explained in section  [ sec : lines ] while basic observation results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the broader astrophysical implications of our observational results are discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "a summary is provided at the end .",
    "long - slit spectroscopic data obtained with isaac at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) have been combined with data obtained with sinfoni at the vlt to study a small sample of early - type galaxies in the nearby fornax cluster .",

    "the difference frame was used to define the illuminated region of the isaac sw detector ( the entire detector is not illuminated in sws mode ) .",

    "the resultant frame is suitable for removing pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations .",
    "these flat - field frames obtained immediately after all telluric sequences are preferred to evening or morning flats since tests demonstrated that such so - called daytime calibrations did not accurately remove fringing .",
    "this is presumably due to grating re - positioning imprecision .",
    "the xear exposures were processed by first subtracting the arc - off frame from the arc - on frame , again to remove any background illumination not associated with the xear lamps .",
    "a two - dimensional wavelength dispersion correction was derived , using low - order polynomials in both dimensions .      for each telluric absorption correction star sequence ,",
    "the five individual frames were first trimmed to correspond to the illuminated part of the detector ( see above ) and then divided by their associated flat - field .",
    "a background@xmath8dark frame was determined by median combining the individual flattened exposures .",
    "this background frame was then subtracted from those exposures .",
    "the five flat - field and background corrected frames were summed into a single frame .",
    "a spectral tilt correction was determined from the resultant frame .",
    "spectral tilt and wavelength dispersion corrections were then applied to the summed , flat - field corrected frame .",
    "the five individual spectra were extracted and averaged into a single spectrum using a sigma - clipping algorithm for bad pixel rejection .",
    "this combined spectrum was used to produce two things : a normalized telluric absorption line correction spectrum and a instrument sensitivity correction .",
    "building the normalized telluric correction spectrum started by fitting a one - dimensional bi - cubic spline to the telluric star spectrum .",
    "care was taken to reject high outliers ( e.g. cosmic rays , bad pixels ) but not too many low outliers ( likely to be the telluric absorption features of interest ) .",
    "the derived vector was divided back into the original spectrum to normalize it and remove the continuum shape .",
    "this bi - cubic spline fit was then re - used to determine an instrument sensitivity curve . since the color of the telluric stars is known from the hipparcos catalog , a reasonable estimate of their effective temperature can be made .",
    "furthermore , since these are hot stars , we know that their continuum in the k - band is well approximated by the rayleigh - jeans part of the blackbody spectrum associated with their effective temperature . by computing the appropriate blackbody curve in the relevant wavelength range and then dividing it by the bi - cubic spline fit ( i.e. a representation of the observed stellar continuum ) , the instrument sensitivity function can be estimated .",
    "of course , this is not an absolute correction  but an absolute correction is not necessary for the spectral line strength measurements described below .",
    "cluster star sequences were processed into single combined spectra in a similar manner as telluric star sequences . at that point ,",
    "the combined spectrum of each star was divided by its associated normalized telluric absorption line correction spectrum . to remove the instrument response signature , the telluric corrected cluster star spectrum",
    "is then multiplied by the instrument sensitivity function .    to achieve the optimal telluric absorption line correction , it was typically necessary both to shift the telluric star spectrum in the dispersion direction ( usually by less than 1 pixel ) and scale it ( usually by a few percent ) before the division .",
    "the physical cause of the physical shift in the dispersion direction is unclear .",
    "however , the need to scale is simply due to the slight changes in airmass and time between object and telluric correction standard observations .",
    "it is also clear that the strength of every telluric absorption feature in this wavelength window is not changing in concert .",
    "thus , the telluric correction is not perfect at all wavelengths . in principle",
    ", a more sophisticated correction process is possible . in practice ,",
    "the current level of correction is good enough for this application .",
    "the final processed spectra for all observed cluster stars are shown in figure  [ fig : clusterstars ] .",
    "the main technical goal of this paper is to make accurate line strength measurements in the central regions of our target galaxies .",
    "however , in the future , the radial line strength gradients will also be studied . since each ab galaxy observation",
    "is only separated by @xmath16 100 , a simple ab subtraction ( i.e. the typical procedure in the near - ir ) could cause inaccurate dark and background correction in the lower surface brightness parts of the galaxy luminosity profiles .",
    "therefore , a procedure derived from the processing of _ optical _ long - slit spectra was applied .",
    "the basic data processing challenge is shown in figure  [ fig : galprocexample ] where a central 3 diameter extraction of ngc1404 ( sequence d ; see table  [ tab : galsample ] ) is shown at three stages : before background correction , after background correction but before telluric absorption line correction , and after all processing .",
    "one of the major advantages of isaac over other near - ir spectrometers is the ability to use a high - enough spectral resolution to resolve telluric features so that they can be accurately removed .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : galsample ] , each galaxy observation consists of a series of 6 or 8 individual exposures taken in abba sequences . to begin ,",
    "each galaxy frame was trimmed and the appropriate median dark frame was subtracted . following the advice of the _ isaac data reduction guide _",
    "( available on - line from the eso isaac web page ) , electronic ghosting was removed using the eclipse recipe _",
    "isaacp ghost_.    recall that each galaxy sequence had an associated telluric@xmath8lamp sequence .",
    "as described in the telluric star processing section above , each telluric@xmath8lamp sequence was processed into a series of calibrations : flat - field , two - dimensional wavelength dispersion solution , spectral tilt correction , normalized telluric absorption correction vector , and instrument sensitivity function .",
    "after electronic ghost correction , each individual galaxy frame was divided by this flat - field and then geometrically rectified using the derived dispersion and spectral tilt solutions . in short , the galaxy sequence and its associated telluric star are calibrated using the same frames and vectors .",
    "a slit illumination correction was applied next .",
    "since twilight sky exposures were not available , the correction function had to be reconstructed from the actual observations . in each individual galaxy observation , the spatial dimension can be divided into a galaxy sub - section and a sky sub - section . for each ab pair ,",
    "the sky sub - section is on opposite sides of the slit center .",
    "the a and b sky sub - sections were extracted and merged into a single a@xmath8b sky frame , after applying a small additive offset to the b sky sub - section to align it better with the a sky sub - section .",
    "this offset is caused by temporal changes in the background between the a and b exposures .",

    "the dilemma is clear : how can a temperature - sensitive index like remain constant while mean rgb effective temperature decreases due to increasing [ z / h ] ?    without appropriate population synthesis models or stellar spectra , only a few speculative thoughts can be offered . in their detailed comparison of non - solar aboundance population synthesis models with measurements of spectral indices in the optical lick system , trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) concluded that their best - fit models included enhancements in c ,",
    "n , na , and si ( among others ) .",
    "as [ @xmath40/h ] increases with @xmath1 ( as suggested by increasing ) , stronger cn bands in the and on - band and off - band windows ( see the wk96 spectra referenced above and the band definitions in table  [ tab : features ] ) may have the effect of depressing the local continuum and hence decreasing the value of @xmath34 ( @xmath8 ) /2 .",
    "for example , trager et al . noted a similar effect from c@xmath41 bands in the optical mg _ b _ index .",
    "therefore , it may be that above some critical mean [ @xmath40/h ] and below some critical mean effective temperature , stays within a narrow range and provides no useful information about mean [ z / h ] , [ fe / h ] , or effective temperature .    a conclusive astrophysical explanation of in early - type galaxies with @xmath39 150 @xmath3 awaits larger galaxy samples , observations of appropriate stars ( e.g. in the galactic bulge ) , and detailed population synthesis models .",
    "the feature is dominated by the @xmath42co(2,0 ) bandhead and has no significant absorption components from other elements .",
    "like above , is highly correlated with @xmath29 in the observed galactic open cluster stars and reaches larger values than observed in the galaxies . as a function of central velocity dispersion @xmath1 in the observed galaxies , does not appear to saturate ( or at least not as definitively as ) .",
    "this adds credence to the suspicion that  is not tracing mean rgb effective temperature in galaxies with @xmath39 150 @xmath3 .",
    "based on the current measurements , no conclusions can be reached about relative carbon or oxygen abundance in these galaxies .",
    "no obvious explanation presents itself for the behavior of in this galaxy sample .",
    "the feature is intrinsically complex , consisting of contributions from many absorbers : ca , s , si , and ti ( all @xmath40-elements ) as well as sc and fe ( see @xmath7 dra , mo iii spectrum in wk96 , p. 342 ) . as a function of in the range of interest ,",
    "some of the contributing absorption lines get stronger ( sc and ti , the former faster than the latter ) , some features get weaker ( si ) , and some remain roughly constant ( ca , s , and fe ) ( cf .",
    "ramirez et al .",
    "relative to solar abundance ratios , trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have argued that si and s are over - abundant and ca is under - abundant in early - type galaxies while [ ti / fe ] and [ sc / fe ] have their solar values . in the galactic open cluster stars observed here , the feature is stronger at a given @xmath6 ( @xmath43 ) in the solar - metallicity stars than in the more metal - poor stars . within the galaxies",
    "observed here , appears to have significant scatter at any given @xmath1 or .",
    "no obvious explanation for this scatter ( or the global behavior of  with @xmath1 and ) presents itself at this time .",
    "using new , moderate resolution ( @xmath44 ) k - band spectra , spectral indices have been measured in the central regions of eleven early - type galaxies in the nearby fornax cluster .",
    "based on these measurements , the following conclusions were reached :    1 .",
    "the feature is much stronger in these fornax early - type galaxies than observed in solar - metallicity galactic open cluster stars .",
    "this is attributed to relative [ si / fe ] ( and possible [ na / fe ] ) differences between the open cluster stars and the fornax galaxies , i.e. both are larger in the fornax galaxies than in the cluster stars .",
    "2 .   in various near - ir",
    "diagnostic diagrams , galaxies with optical indices indicative of a warm stellar component are clearly separated from galaxies dominated by colder , presumably old ( @xmath5 8 gyr ) stellar populations .",
    "changes in the near - ir spectra features are consistent with the presence of an cool component dominated by late k and/or early m giants stars . in combination ,",
    "the optical and near - ir observations are consistent with the presence of a young stellar component with a warm msto and a significant extended giant branch consisting of tp - agb stars .",
    "3 .   for detecting a young stellar component",
    ", the vs.  @xmath1 or vs.  @xmath1 diagnostic diagram seems as efficient as using h@xmath4 vs. ( or other similar combinations of optical indices ) .",
    "the near - ir features have the additional advantage that no emission - line correction is needed ( as it is necessary for the stronger optical balmer lines ) .",
    "the index saturates in galaxies with central velocity dispersion @xmath1 @xmath33 150 @xmath3 dominated by old ( @xmath5 8 gyr ) stellar populations . for @xmath39 150 @xmath3",
    ", these fe features are unlikely to be useful for investigating stellar population differences between early - type galaxies . above @xmath39 150 @xmath3 ,",
    "the continued increase in  ( and ) strength with @xmath1 coupled with constant  presents an astrophysical challenge .",
    "although it is tempting to conclude that [ fe / h ] reaches a maximum value , while [ @xmath40/h ] ( and hence [ z / h ] ) continues to increase , more observational and population synthesis work is needed to understand conclusively the behavior of in these high - mass early - type galaxies .    adding these near - ir indices to the standard diagnostic toolkit for analyzing the integrated light of early - type galaxies clearly has great potential",
    "to develop this potential , three obvious steps are needed : observe more galaxies over a larger range of central velocity dispersion ( including field galaxies with existing optical data ) and extend current population synthesis models to the near - ir .",
    "we know that various groups are working on both steps",
    ". it would also be useful to study the radial behavior of these indices within individual galaxies to compare and contrast index behavior between galaxies .",
    "for the foreseeable future , the study of the central populations in early - type galaxies will remain the study of integrated light . as distance increases ,",
    "our ability to study the central regions of early - type galaxies within metric apertures equivalent to nearby galaxies relies on the high _ spatial _ resolution spectroscopy achievable from space or with adaptive optics on the ground . in the former case , the james webb space telescope represents the frontier  yet , no optical spectrograph that works below 0.8 @xmath0 m is currently planned . in the latter case , the frontier will be shaped by further development of adaptive optics systems  and these systems will achieve their best performance beyond 1 @xmath0 m . hence , understanding how to interpret near - ir spectral indices in nearby galaxies is key to facilitating the kind of investigation and characterization of more distant early - type galaxies that will not be possible at optical wavelengths .",
