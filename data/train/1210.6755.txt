    "in the present paper , a certain approach to understanding neutrino mixing , proposed in @xcite and further studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite will be examined in more detail .",
    "this approach is based on assuming the permutation group @xmath0 symmetry for the lepton sector to be a starting point .",
    "the three neutrinos are arranged to be degenerate in this limit .",
    "analogously to the su(3 ) flavor and isospin breaking in qcd we add two breaking terms in different @xmath0  directions \" with different strengths .",
    "of course there have been many related treatments of this topic in the literature @xcite - @xcite .",
    "there are two new features compared to our earlier papers .",
    "first the order of the two perturbations will be arranged to correspond to the observed hierarchy between the  atmospheric \" neutrino mixing and the  solar \" neutrino mixing .",
    "secondly the effect of  dirac type \" cp - violation will be included in addition to the previous majorana type cp - violation .",
    "in @xcite the  unperturbed \" neutrino mass matrix was taken to be the @xmath0 symmetric form , @xmath2+\\beta \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } 1&1&1\\\\ 1&1&1\\\\ 1&1&1\\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] \\equiv \\alpha { \\bf 1}+\\beta d .",

    "we introduce the notation , @xmath10 the physical phase @xmath11 lies in the range : @xmath12 and @xmath13 is related to @xmath4 by , @xmath14    in @xcite the effect of a perturbation matrix of the form , @xmath15 was considered with @xmath16 and @xmath17 real .    in the present work",
    ", we will first reduce the number of parameters by setting @xmath18 .",
    "this has the effect of eliminating the smaller  solar neutrino \" mass splitting at the first order of perturbation .",
    "that , as well as cp - violation effects will be introduced at the next order of perturbation via the matrix ,    @xmath19    here @xmath20 is real and @xmath21 is a cp - violating phase .",
    "this represents a variation of the similar matrix @xmath22 used in the doubly perturbed model of @xcite .",
    "hence the present model has only the three perturbation parameters @xmath16 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath16 will be considered to be of first order strength while @xmath20 will be taken to be second order . on the other hand",
    "the cp phase will not necessarily be taken small .",
    "the @xmath23 term will introduce both non - zero solar neutrino masses and dirac type cp - violation .",
    "the main work will be to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of , @xmath24",
    "since we are working in a basis where the zeroth order piece is diagonalized by the tribimaximal matrix @xmath7 , we must bring to diagonal form the matrix : @xmath25 denoting the non - trivial 2 @xmath26 2 , ( 13 ) sub - block by @xmath27 , @xmath28 we diagonalize the hermitian quantity @xmath29 with a unitary matrix @xmath30 in the usual way , @xmath31 this implies , as actually required to bring the majorana type neutrino mass matrix to diagonal form , @xmath32 explicitly , @xmath33 where to second order , @xmath34 .",

    "if one assumes that the factor matrix associated with diagonalizing the charged lepton mass matrix contains only small angles , eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) should provide a reasonable approximation to the leptonic analog of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix .",
    "such an assumption seems plausible since , for example , in grand unified models @xcite and @xcite , the charged lepton contributions are similar in magnitude to the quark contributions ( which do involve small angles ) . in the present @xmath0 framework",
    ", it was shown in section v of @xcite that the charged lepton contribution can be arranged to vanish .",
    "clearly it is sensible to first analyze the  neutrino dominance \" case in detail .",
    "first we have important information from neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite-@xcite .",

    "it can be seen that @xmath61 gets larger for smaller values of the majorana phase , @xmath11 , for degenerate neutrino masses .",
    "we have not discussed the role of the higgs sector in this paper but some technical details were discussed in @xcite . we have also assumed that the diagonalization of the charged lepton mass matrix makes a negligible contribution to the lepton mixing matrix .",
    "of course , at a later stage , the contributions of the charged leptons should be included at the expense of additional parameters or assumptions .",
