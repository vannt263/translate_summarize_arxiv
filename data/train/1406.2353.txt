    "spectroscopic investigation of @xmath2 hypernuclei is a unique method which provides invaluable information on many - body baryonic systems by inserting a new degree of freedom , `` strangeness '' , into the nucleus .",
    "since the @xmath2 is not pauli - blocked , it can occupy any single - particle state , providing a distinguishable probe of the nuclear interior  @xcite .",
    "therefore , new nuclear structures or unknown properties of the baryonic interaction , which can not be seen from the investigation of ordinary nuclei with conventional probes , may manifest themselves in hypernuclei , providing indispensable information on flavor su(3 ) for baryonic matter .",
    "in addition , a study of hypernuclear spectra provides the only practical way to study the @xmath3 interaction , as @xmath3 scattering experiments are technically difficult or impossible .    aside from strangeness ,",
    "another important feature is the absence of isospin ( i = 0 ) of the @xmath2 .",
    "as isospin conservation prevents one - pion - exchange ( ope ) in the @xmath3 interaction , the long range ope component is absent and thus the @xmath3 interaction is more sensitive to short range components of the strong interaction than the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "since @xmath2 decays weakly and has a relatively long lifetime ( @xmath4 ps ) , the spectroscopy of @xmath2 hypernuclei features narrow states commonly described by coupling low - lying nuclear - hole states to @xmath2 single particle states with widths ranging from a few to @xmath5 kev .",
    "this makes detailed spectroscopic studies possible .    a phenomenological approach to @xmath1-shell @xmath2 hypernuclei introduces a two - body effective potential  @xcite in form of @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "low - lying levels of @xmath1-shell hypernuclei can be described with radial integrals over the @xmath8@xmath9 wave function for each of the five terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eq1 ] ) .",
    "a set of these integrals , denoted as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , can be determined from selected @xmath1-shell @xmath2-hypernuclear spectroscopy and then used to fit the @xmath3 interactions .",
    "the other approach applies a g - matrix derived from models ( nijmegen  @xcite or jlich  @xcite ) which describe the baryon - baryon interactions including the free @xmath3 interactions . when using this more direct description , the properties of @xmath3 interaction models can be explored",
    "however , high precision spectroscopy is required with either approach in order to obtain reliable information on the unique characteristics of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "traditionally the spectroscopy of @xmath2 hypernuclei were obtained using beams of pions or kaons , either stopped in a target or in - flight . in reactions such as @xmath15 or @xmath16 , a nucleon in a target",
    "was replaced by a @xmath2 .",
    "however , the resolution using mesonic beams was limited to about or more than 1.5 mev ( fwhm ) due to the fact that these beams are produced by reactions of a primary beam on a production target and thus are limited in intensity . to compensate for the low beam intensity , thick targets ( @xmath17 )",
    "were used broadening the resolution by the uncertainty in energy loss .",
    "weakly excited states , particularly low - lying states , were difficult to resolve and their binding energies inaccurately extracted . yet in many cases the weakly produced states are quite important when comparing an experiment to theoretical calculations .",
    "for example , the recent high precision @xmath18-transition spectroscopy experiments at kek and ags reported a total of 22 precisely measured level transitions for several @xmath1-shell hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "these results enabled a detailed theoretical study of @xmath1-shell @xmath2 hypernuclei .",
    "new values of the integrals given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eq1 ] ) were extracted , as well as contributions from each term to the binding energies  @xcite . however",
    ", gamma transition energies can not provide information on ground state binding energies .",
    "electroproduction using the ( e , e^k^+)@xmath0 reaction with intense beams at the jefferson lab accelerator provides a unique opportunity to study high precision hypernuclear spectroscopy .",
    "an energy resolution of @xmath19 kev ( fwhm ) can be achieved using a combination of ( 1 ) the small emittance of the electron beam , ( 2 ) the excellent momentum resolution using precision spectrometers for the scattered electron and produced kaon , ( 3 ) the precision measurement of the scattering angles , and ( 4 ) the thin target foils minimizing target straggling and radiative corrections . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental design must accommodate high luminosity , potential backgrounds , and precise calibration of the spectrometers .",
    "electroproduction brings in additional new features to the overall investigation of hypernuclei .",
    "the ( e , e^k^+)@xmath0 reaction produces a @xmath2 from a proton in the nucleus creating a proton hole in the core to which the @xmath2 couples .",
    "this can produce either mirror hypernuclei to those produced by the hadronic reactions ( k^-,^-)@xmath20 and ( ^+,k^+)@xmath21 , or states with different isospin .",
    "thus , electroproduction produces neutron - rich hypernuclei that are suitable candidates to investigate @xmath22 coupling and the effective @xmath23 three - body force .",
    "furthermore , electroproduction involves large spin - flip transition amplitudes from the initial nuclear to the final hypernuclear states .",
    "still , the non - spin - flip amplitude remains non - negligible .",
    "the transition density for transitions between nodeless orbits leads to a peak in the form factor at @xmath24 . as for ( ^+,k^+)@xmath21 reactions ,",
    "the minimum momentum transfer is large ( @xmath25 mev / c ) .",
    "this is beyond the peak of the form factor and means that all cross sections will fall with inreasing @xmath26 ( reaction angle ) and that high values of @xmath27 are favored .",
    "thus , deeply - bound hypernuclear states ( i.e. the ground state and states with the @xmath2 in low @xmath28 orbits ) with both natural and unnatural parities may simultaneously appear , and provide a rich and new spectroscopy complementary to that from hadronic reactions .",
    "the high resolution allows extension of these studies to @xmath29-shell states that could not be confirmed by low - resolution experiments or @xmath18 spectroscopy .    to compensate for the small electroproduction cross sections ,",
    "high luminosity and forward spectrometer angles for both the scattered electrons and the reaction kaons are required .",
    "this creates a challenge to design an experiment with two large spectrometers essentially placed at zero degrees . over the last decade ,",
    "two independent hypernuclear programs in jlab hall a  @xcite and hall c  @xcite have been developed and undertaken with encouraging results  @xcite .",
    "the second and third phase hall c experiments , e01 - 011 and e05 - 115 , resulted in two new data sets , producing high resolution in the spectra of , and and , , and .",
    "this paper presents a combined analysis of the spectroscopy from the the hall c program .",
    "the analysis of from the second phase experiment e01 - 011 has been previously published and papers describing the spectra from other hypernuclei are forthcoming .",
    "the jlab hall c hks experiments , e01 - 011 and e05 - 115 are two , consecutive hypernuclear spectroscopy experiments ( see schematic illustration in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure1 ] ) which follow the first pioneering experiment ( hnss e89 - 009 ) . upgrades and a new configuration were made to improve energy resolution , yield , and the use of a higher incident energy beam increased the virtual photon flux .",
    "experiment e01 - 011 used a new , high resolution kaon spectrometer ( hks ) having a short orbit and a large solid angle acceptance .",
    "an off scattering - plane geometry , the `` tilt method '' , was applied to the electron spectrometer , the enge split - pole spectrometer ( enge )  @xcite . in e05 - 115 ,",
    "the previously used `` c '' type splitting magnet ( spl ) and enge were replaced by a new `` h '' type splitting magnet and a new high resolution electron spectrometer ( he s ) with a larger solid angle acceptance . the same `` tilt method '' which proved successful in e01 - 011",
    "was also applied to the he s .",
    "the goal of this series of upgrades was to improve precision and yield , in order to widen the spectroscopic studies beyond the @xmath1-shell .",
    "a charge - separation splitting magnet ( spl ) , common to both spectrometers , is used by all the hall c hypernuclear experiments in order to separate positive reaction kaons from the electrons .",
    "the nuclear target under investigation is located at front effective field boundary ( efb ) of the spl which bends the oppositely charged particles ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) away from the beam in the opposite directions .",
    "this technique allows the spectrometers to be placed at forward angles close to the target . as a result",
    ", the reaction particles are measured at very forward angles , with minimal path length for the short - lived kaons , and with increased solid angle acceptance .",
    "all these are crucial factors which increase the yield .",
    "however , a common spl configuration also creates unavoidable challenges which are discussed in later sections .",

    "the beam must be redirected to a high power beam dump in order to avoid serious radiation problems . in e01 - 011",
    ", additional dipole magnets were installed downstream of the spl to redirect the beam to the dump , while for e05 - 115 a pre - chicaned beam technique was applied to provide an incident beam angle which canceled the bending angle of the spl .",
    "although the pre - chicane method requires careful tuning of the primary beam , it is significantly easier than that of tuning the beam transportation after the spl and provides cleaner beam transport to the dump .",
    "the extremely high electron singles rate in the electron spectrometer from bremsstrahlung and mller scattering presents another challenge at forward angles .",
    "these background electrons are bent by the common spl toward the electron spectrometer .",
    "this problem limited the luminosity in the first experiment e89 - 009 ( hnss ) to @xmath32 on a @xmath33 thick c target , suppressing hypernuclear production while creating high accidental background .",
    "the `` tilt method '' was developed for the latter two ( hks ) experiments .",
    "the electron spectrometer ( enge for e01 - 011 and he s for e05 - 115 ) was tilted up , pivoting about a point approximately 43 cm upstream of the virtual target point , by an angle of @xmath34 off the plane as defined by the beam and the hks momentum dispersion plane .",
    "this is equivalent to a rotation plus a shift of the spectrometer .",
    "in such a configuration the scattered electrons at near zero degrees are blocked by the spectrometer yokes so that they lie outside the spectrometer acceptance .",
    "the rates for bremsstrahlung and mller scattering electrons decrease more rapidly with increases in scattering angle than does the virtual photon flux , especially when higher beam energies are used .",
    "the tilt angle corresponds to a lower cut - off in the electron scattering angle of @xmath35 , a choice based on an optimization between the yield and the accidental background which could be accommodated by the experiments . using this method ,",
    "both e01 - 011 and e05 - 115 were able to increase the target thickness to @xmath36 and the beam current up to @xmath37 while maintaining the electron singles rate at a level of approximately 3 mhz .",
    "this background was almost 100 times smaller than in the first experiment , e89 - 009 , improving the yield by more than an order of magnitude .",

    ". comparisons of early and recent spectroscopic investigations on  @xcite and  @xcite with @xmath42 shell - model calculations commonly result in leftover strength around the @xmath43 peaks . in the hks experiments ,",
    "these are fit using the same width as the other peaks . as discussed also in ref .",
    "@xcite , these two peaks may be due to states with a configuration of @xmath8 coupled to the @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath29-shell core states .",
