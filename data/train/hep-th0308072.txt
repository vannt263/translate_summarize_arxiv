    "the stochastic gravitational wave background ( stochastic gwb ) generated during the inflationary era is a promising source for the low - frequency gravitational waves and this can provide a direct way to probe the extremely early universe . in particular , such gws are expected to have information about the extra dimensions .",
    "inspired by the recent development in particle physics , there has been a lot of active debate on the possibility that we live in a brane which is a three dimensional world embedded in a higher dimensional space @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "if this is true , the standard prediction of stochastic gwb from the four - dimensional theory is dramatically altered and the gwb can be a powerful tool to discriminate the presence / absence of the extra - dimension .",
    "for instance , in the case of the single - brane model proposed by randall & sundrum@xcite , the scale of the extra dimension is well below the length @xmath0 mm according to the current experiments of the newton gravity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the effect of the extra - dimension can be imprinted on the gwb at the low - frequency band , @xmath1 hz @xcite@xcite .    despite the above interesting suggestions , however , quantitative prediction for the stochastic gwb in the brane - world cosmology is still under investigation .",
    "the spectrum of gws generated by de sitter inflation on a brane was first calculated by @xcite . and",
    "later , the cosmological evolution of the gws has been analytically studied in a very idealistic situation : the transition from the de - sitter brane to the minkowski brane @xcite and the transition from the de - sitter brane to the de - sitter brane with different cosmological constant @xcite . for more realistic situation of the cosmological evolution with equation of state @xmath2 ,",
    "however , the wave equation of gws can not be separable and the analytical treatment is generally intractable .",
    "we must tackle the complicated partial differential equation directly .",
    "theoretically , the evolution of gws in the brane - world cosmology is expected to deviate from the standard four - dimensional theory in the following two aspects : 1 ) the non - standard cosmological expansion due to the bulk gravity and 2 ) the excitation of the kaluza - klein mode(kk - mode ) of graviton .",
    "the former may enhance the amplitude of gws and the latter may suppress or modulate the gw form on a brane .",
    "these effects are particularly significant in the high - energy regime of the universe .",
    "an important question is which effect is dominant and how the amplitude of gws changes in a realistic situation of the cosmological brane - world .    for this purpose",
    ", we solve the wave equation of gws numerically in the randall - sundrum type single - brane model .",
    "it has been shown that the excitation of kk - modes are suppressed during inflation and zero - mode remains constant after inflation at super - horizon scales @xcite .",
    "thus we will consider the evolution of the gws starting from an initially zero - mode state at super - horizon scales and focus on the behavior just after the horizon - crossing time . in the high - energy regime , the separation between zero - mode and kk - modes does not hold for the modes with wavelength shorter than the horizon .",
    "this implies that even in an initially zero - mode state , kk - modes are inevitably excited when the perturbation crosses the horizon .",
    "thus , we can observe how the excitation of the kk modes modifies the behavior of the perturbations .",
    "we set up the basic equations in section [ sec : basic_equation ] .",
    "based on these equations , the numerical calculation of wave equation is performed and the results are presented in section [ sec : numerical_analysis ] . to understand the behavior on the brane , section [ sec : low - energy_expansion ] describes the semi - analytic treatment .",
    "using the low - energy approximation , we derive an effective equation of the gws on the brane .",
    "the resultant equation reduces to the ordinary differential equation and the numerical results of this equation reasonably match those of the full numerical treatment . final section [ sec : summary ]",
    "is devoted to the summary and discussion .",
    "in this letter , we specifically treat the single - brane model embedded in a five - dimensional anti - de sitter space , in which the matter content on brane is simply given by a homogeneous and isotropic perfect fluid satisfying the equation of state @xmath2 . using the gaussian normal coordinate to the brane , the background metric",
    "is given by @xmath3 where the brane is located at @xmath4 .",
    "the lapse function @xmath5 and the scale factor @xmath6 for the background space - time are determined from the five - dimensional einstein equation . in absence of the dark radiation , these quantities",
    "are written as follows @xcite@xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the tension of the brane and @xmath9 represents the curvature scale of the anti - de sitter bulk , which is related to the tension @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "the scale factor @xmath12 and the energy density on the brane @xmath13 are determined from the effective friedmann equations @xcite : @xmath14 the solution of the above equations is easily obtained and can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 : @xmath17 where the subscript @xmath18 means the quantity evaluated at the time @xmath19 .",
    "note that the gaussian - normal coordinate has a coordinate singularity at @xmath20 , defined by @xmath21 : @xmath22    now consider the tensor perturbation in the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) .",
    "the perturbed metric becomes @xmath23 the perturbed quantity @xmath24 satisfies the transverse and the traceless conditions , which is automatically gauge - invariant . decomposing the perturbation in spatial fourier modes as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is transverse - traceless polarization tensor , the wave equation for the fourier component @xmath27 becomes @xcite : @xmath28 where the dot and the prime respectively denote the derivative with respect to the time @xmath29 and the bulk coordinate @xmath30 .",
    "the above equation must be solved under the boundary condition at the brane , which follows from the perturbed israel condition . ignoring the anisotropic stress tensor @xmath31 arising from the matter on brane",
    ", we obtain the junction condition : @xmath32    hereafter , we will focus on the time evolution of the tensor perturbation in the radiation - dominated epoch(@xmath33 ) and solve the wave equation ( [ eq : evolution ] ) numerically .",
    "to solve the wave equation ( [ eq : evolution ] ) numerically , we use the spectral method , which is a standard technique in the computational fluid dynamics @xcite and recently becomes popular in subject of numerical relativity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to be precise ,",
    "we adopt a tchebychev collocation method with the gauss - lobatto collocation points , @xmath34 with @xmath35 . with this method ,",
    "the quantity @xmath36 is first transformed to a set of variables @xmath37 defined in the tchebychev space , and the partial differential equation ( [ eq : evolution ] ) can be regarded as the ordinary differential equations for @xmath38 .",
    "then , the time evolution of @xmath38 is followed by the predictor - corrector method based on the adams - bashforth - moulton finite - difference scheme .    as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , the initial condition for the quantity @xmath27 is set to the zero - mode solution in the inflationary era , i.e. , @xmath39 constant . the calculations are then started before the wavelength of the zero - mode crosses the hubble horizon . for convenience",
    ", we set the comoving wave number @xmath40 to @xmath41 , that is , the gw mode just crosses the hubble horizon when @xmath19 .",
    "the difficulty in present numerical calculation is that the computational domain should be finite .",
    "in addition , the gaussian normal coordinate ( [ eq : metric ] ) has a coordinate singularity ( see eq.([eq : singularity ] ) ) .",
    "hence , we must introduce another boundary in the bulk and impose another boundary condition at this boundary for numerical purpose .",
    "perhaps , the simplest choice is the static boundary , however , due to the narrow computational domain , the suppression of light kk - modes becomes significant and the artifitial reflection wave affects the physical brane . in this letter , to remedy this , we put a moving regulator brane at @xmath42 inside the coordinate singularity and impose the neumann boundary condition , the calculation with the static boundary can reproduce the results using the moving boundary at an early time , however , the late - time pahse of the calculation is significantly affected by the artifitial reflection wave . ] : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the normal vector to the boundary trajectory . to impose this boundary condition in the spectral method",
    ", we introduce the new coordinate @xmath45 , and solve ( [ eq : evolution ] ) in the fixed range @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "thus , provided the location of the boundaries @xmath4 and @xmath47 , the only physical parameter is @xmath48 , i.e. , the dimensionless energy density @xmath49 at the horizon - crossing time , which is directly related to the scale of the gw concerned . for large @xmath48 ,",
    "the physical brane is very close to the coordinate singularity and the computational domain of our code becomes narrow .",
    "this causes pathological behavior near the coordinate singularity .",
    "hence , in this letter , we restrict our analysis to the the small @xmath48 case .    ) .",
    "the upper right window is the zoom - up of the solutions in the range @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig : sol_on_brane],width=377 ]     in the case with the parameters @xmath51 .",
    "[ fig : snapshot],width=377 ]    in fig.[fig : sol_on_brane ] , the resultant waveform on the brane is depicted as function of time in the case with @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "apart from the overall damping @xmath55 due to the cosmological expansion , the amplitude of the numerical solution on the brane ( _ solid _ ) becomes smaller than that of the solution in the four - dimensional theory ( _ long - dashed _ ) .",
    "this result simply reflects the fact that the localization of gravity is not fulfilled in presence of the @xmath56-term ( see eq.([eq : hubble ] ) ) and the gw can easily escape from the brane to the bulk .",
    "[ fig : damping],width=377 ]    fig.[fig : snapshot ] shows the snapshots of the waveform plotted as function of the original coordinate @xmath30 . in the low - energy limit ( @xmath57 ) of the present case , the equation ( [ eq : evolution ] ) becomes separable and the analytic solution can be obtained as @xmath58 .",
    "the mode function for the bulk coordinate @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 for the zero - mode and @xmath61 for the kk - mode with the effective mass @xmath62 .",
    "the function @xmath63 denotes the hankel function for the second kind .",
    "we attempted to approximate the wave form of the numerical result by the superposition of the mode funcitons ( [ eq : zero - mode ] ) and ( [ eq : kk - mode ] ) .",
    "if we set the mass of the kk - mode to the hubble parameter at the horizon crossing time , the mode functions roughly reproduce the waveform of the numerical result , although the agreement is at a qualitative level .",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig : sol_on_brane ] and [ fig : snapshot ] that the created kk - modes is rather light , consistent with our numerical set - up with @xmath64 , however , to obtain the kk - mode spectrum , a more quantitative analysis is needed .",
    "the introduction of the regulator brane in the bulk is certainly not a proper way to treat the boundary condition in the bulk .",
    "the regulator brane may eventually affect the physical brane located at @xmath4 .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : sol_on_brane ] , however , the excitation of the massive kk - modes becomes significant only at the horizon crossing time .",
    "the modification of the amplitude is almost determined around the horizon crossing and we need not follow the evolution of the perturbations for a long time .",
    "thus , if the regulator brane is located sufficiently far away from the physical brane , we expect that we can safely neglect the effect of the regulator brane . to confirm this , in fig.3 , we plot the damping factor , i.e. , the ratio of the amplitude obtained from the numerical solution to that from the four - dimensional theory in the case of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the number of collocation points used here is @xmath54 except for the cases of the boundary parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 . since the suppression of gw amplitude is effective only when the mode crosses the hubble horizon , the damping factor evaluated at the end of the calculaiton is time - independent .",
    "the damping factor depends linearly on small @xmath48 , and tends to converge for @xmath71 .",
    "in order to understand the behavior of the numerical results in previous section , we employ a low energy expansion scheme to solve the wave equation approximately . in this treatment , the term @xmath49 in effective friedmann equation ( [ eq : hubble ] ) is assumed to be small .",
    "thus , treating the dimensionless quantity @xmath16 as small expansion parameter , we expand the tensor perturbation @xmath36 , the scale factor @xmath72 and the hubble parameter @xmath73 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the functions of the order @xmath78 .",
    "note further the fact that in the low energy approximation , the time - derivative of the lower - order quantities is comparable to the @xmath30-derivative of the higher - order ones @xcite .",
    "this is because the time derivative is of the order of the hubble parameter , while the @xmath30-derivative is of the order of the bulk scale @xmath79 .",
    "thus , we have : @xmath80 keeping the relation ( [ eq : low_energy_expansion ] ) in mind , one can expand the wave equation ( [ eq : evolution ] ) in terms of @xmath81 and find the higher - order solutions iteratively . then , imposing boundary conditions , we derive an ordinary differential equations for @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the equation for @xmath82 is straightforward but lengthly calculation .",
    "the final form of the equation up to the first order in @xmath81 is @xmath83 in the case of the static boundary . here",
    ", we defined the operator @xmath84 and the quantity @xmath85 as follows : @xmath86 @xmath87 the variable @xmath88 denotes the position of the boundary determined at an initial time @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "if the regulator brane is moving , the equation contains the term proportional to @xmath91 and it becomes rather complicated .",
    "note also that this approximation will break down if the regulator brane becomes far away from our brane : @xmath92 since the low energy approximation breaks down on the regulator brane .    in spite of the above limitations of this approximation ,",
    "the numerical results for @xmath82 quite well reproduces the full numerical simulation even in the case of the moving boundary ) reproduces the full numerical simulation with the static boundary if @xmath93 . ]",
    "( see _ short - dashed _ in fig.[fig : sol_on_brane ] ) .",
    "thus , at least in a qualitative level , we can use this approximation to understand the behavior of perturbations on the brane .",
    "the effective equation ( [ eq : lee ] ) contains a higher derivative term @xmath94 which describes the non - local effect caused by the propagation of the wave in the bulk . if we numerically solve the equation with this higher - derivative term , we find that the solution badly diverges in time .",
    "it might be caused by the truncation of infinite numbers of higher derivative terms at a finite order .",
    "hence we neglect the @xmath94 term when we solve the ordinary differential equation ( [ eq : lee ] ) numerically .",
    "the first terms in the coefficients of @xmath95 and @xmath96 come from the modification of background friedmann equation , that is , @xmath56-term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubble ] ) .",
    "the second terms arise from the non - separable nature of the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) , which can be deduced from the fact that they vanish if we take @xmath97 .",
    "these are the terms which excite kk - modes in the bulk and cause the dissipation of the perturbations on the brane .    in the long wavelength limit @xmath98 , the zero - mode solution @xmath99 const .",
    "is the solution for the effective equation ( [ eq : lee ] ) .",
    "however , if the perturbation crosses the horizon , the zero - mode solution which satisfies @xmath100 can not be a solution",
    ". then the kk - modes are inevitably excited .",
    "the effects of the non - standard cosmological expansion tend to enhance the amplitude of the perturbation compared to the four - dimensional theory . on the other hand ,",
    "both the numerical results and the low energy approximation show that the amplitude of the perturbations decreases , which implies that the influence of the excitation of kk - modes overcomes the effects of the non - standard cosmological expansion .",
    "therefore , the suppression of the amplitude of gws can be understood as the consequence of the excitation of the kk - modes due to the non - separable nature of the bulk metric in the gaussian normal coordinate defined with respect to the physical brane .",
    "in this letter , we have numerically investigated the evolution of gws during the radiation dominated epoch in the randall - sundrum type single - brane model . especially focusing on the behavior after the horizon - crossing time",
    ", we found that the amplitude of gws on brane is suppressed compared to that of the four - dimensional theory . to interpret the numerical results",
    ", we also employ the low energy approximation and derive the effective wave equation on the brane ( eq.([eq : lee ] ) ) .",
    "the solution of this equation reasonably agrees with numerical simulations and the suppression of gws can be understood as a consequence of the excitation of kk - modes .",
    "although the created kk - modes seem to be rather soft , the influence of the kk - modes on gws overcomes the effect of the non - standard cosmological expansion arising from the @xmath56-term .",
    "the suppression of gws becomes significant as increasing the energy scales @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , contrary to the four - dimensional prediction , the intensity of the stochastic gwb around the frequency @xmath101 tends to decrease as increasing the frequency , which might provide an important clue to probe the presence or the absence of extra - dimensions .    for more quantitative prediction for the spectrum of stochastic gwb",
    ", however , the present numerical analysis has several limitations .",
    "while the evolved amplitude of gws is examined at the relatively low energy scales @xmath64 , corresponding to the low - frequency modes with @xmath102 , the high - frequency gws with @xmath103 are expected to suffer from the high - energy effects more seriously . as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", the created kk - modes does not simply escape away from the brane to the bulk in the high - energy region @xmath104 .",
    "they could be turned back to the brane by the curvature scattering of the anti - de sitter bulk , leading to the significant enhancement or the modulation of the gws on brane .    in order to investigate the degree of this effect",
    "precisely , the boundary condition imposed on the regulator brane might be inadequate . instead of using the neumann condition ( [ eq : neumann ] ) , a suitable choice of the boundary condition such as the non - reflecting boundary condition should be considered .",
    "further , to impose a realistic boundary condition , the poincar coordinate , which covers the wider region of the anti - de sitter spacetime than the gaussian normal coordinate , would be crucial in our numerical calculation .",
    "the implementation of these technical points is straightforward and the analysis is now in progress .",
    "we will report the results in a separate paper@xcite .",
