    "this is intimately intertwined with the ionization dynamics and the complex evolution of the bulk return currents  @xcite .",

    "+ at present , a predictive understanding of high - intensity laser - matter interactions is severely hampered by the lack of self - consistent models for the ionization and recombination dynamics , coupled with the complex electron transport and collisions , and our inability to unravel this complexity with available experimental techniques in laser - only experiments .",
    "for example , effective ionization rates , scattering cross - sections and k@xmath3 and other self - radiation spectra are not precisely known in a non - thermal non - static dense plasma  @xcite . additionally , numeric simulations are limited e.g. due to the short time - step necessary for kinetic simulation of fast plasma oscillations , which can even reach classical electron orbit rotation times in an ion  @xcite . due to the large particle numbers in solid density plasmas",
    "the use of a full quantum mechanical ionization description will surely remain a dream for the next decades .    with the availability of fourth - generation x - ray free electron laser ( fel ) sources and their instrumentation with ultra - intense short - pulse lasers",
    "many novel experiments can be envisioned that will e.g. enhance the diagnostic capabilities for femtosecond laser - solid interactions . due to short duration of xfel pulses and their penetration power through solids ,",

    "the plasma opacity with high spatial and temporal resolution would allow for the first time to directly obtain experimentally the ion distribution during short - pulse ultra - intense laser interaction with solids and compare directly to simulations and ionization models used therein , or to study the plasma and hot electron dynamics through their influence on ionization states .",
    "+ we will show how the low energy bandwidth , small wavelength and penetration power of ultrashort pulses from xfels can be used for small - angle scattering ( saxs ) on plasma structures  @xcite to not only scatter on free electrons but also to resonantly scatter at selected ions ( resonant coherent x - ray diffraction , rcxd ) .",
    "this allows to obtain information with high temporal resolution about the spatial structure of the distribution of electrons and ions ( e.g. filamentation , hole - boring , hot electron divergence and surface structures ) as well as the energy distribution of free electrons ( i.e. plasma temperature)@xcite with few nanometer resolution at the same time , as it is not possible with any other available technique .",
    "it would allow unique tests of models e.g. for non - equilibrium ionization dynamics , heating , resistivity , electron transport or laser absorption .",

    "we discuss the possibilities that open up when transferring the methodology to bound - bound resonances in laser - generated plasmas in order to be sensitive to the ionic scattering signal and much less susceptible to many - body phenomena and plasma screening .",
    "the ionic scattering signal becomes visible against the non - resonant free electron scattering background when the x - ray energy is in resonance with an electron transition between two bound states . in this case",
    "the scattering cross - section dramatically increases due to the optical correction so that the signal of resonant x - ray scattering from ions silhouettes against the free electron scattering background despite the lower ion density .",

    "[ fig : opacity]a for a temperature of @xmath6 for @xmath7 transitions in copper .",
    "when the xfel energy @xmath8 matches that of a bound - bound transition of an ion in a certain electronic configuration @xmath9 , it will excite electron transitions between the two bound states accompanied by emission of x - rays .",
    "this can be treated as resonant scattering of the xfel and be described by the complex valued change @xmath10 of the ionic scattering form factor @xmath11  @xcite ( inset in fig .",

    "+ for the more realistic case of finite xfel fwhm bandwidth @xmath16 and a mixture of ions with different configurations @xmath17 as found in warm plasmas , the average optical corrections to the form factor of ions with @xmath18 bound electrons are given by the sum over all configurations of a charge state weighted by their abundance @xmath19 and averaging over the xfel energy profile , @xmath20 .",
    "the imaginary part of the optical correction caused by a single resonance can be derived from the product of its transition probability and the relative lower level population .",
    "the sum over all resonances in all ions is proportional to the opacity @xmath21 , @xmath22   ( @xmath23 is the foil depth and @xmath24 is the classical electron radius ) . using kramer - kronig s relation , the real part of the optical correction",
    "can be obtained .",
    "figure  [ fig : opacity]b shows the opacity for the example of copper for various plasma temperatures calculated by scfly  @xcite with distinct maxima visible .",
    "the typical naming scheme is following the resonant energy of ground state ions with @xmath18 electrons , e.g. the he- , li- and be - like peaks for @xmath25 respectively .",
    "[ fig : configuration_q_weighted ] shows the contribution of specific ion charges to the total opacity for two plasma temperatures . for cold plasma , for example at the opacity be - like peak around @xmath26 , ions with 4 remaining electrons are responsible for less than @xmath27 of the opacity only . due to the increase of abundance of highly charged ions at the expense of less charged ions , from @xmath28 to @xmath29 temperature the contribution of ions with 5 electrons to the be - like opacity peak decreases while that of ions with @xmath30 and @xmath31 increases . yet , at no temperature does a single ion species dominate . in warm plasmas",
    "generally ions with different numbers of bound electrons contribute significantly to the total opacity at most xfel energies .",
    "+ the reason is that spectator electrons in those shells not significantly screening the nuclear potential as seen by electrons participating in a transition do not influence its resonant energy , e.g. excited ions with specific @xmath18 can have similar resonant energies as a ground state ion with electron number @xmath32 . to give a specific example , for k@xmath3 transitions an ion with @xmath33 remaining electrons being in the excited state @xmath34 with one spectator electron in the m - shell has generally similar resonant energies for transitions between the 1s and 2p@xmath35 and 2p@xmath36 levels as does an ion with @xmath30 in the ground state @xmath37 .",
    "+ therefore , in order to identify resonances , the number @xmath38 of electrons in the lower shells that do influence the transition energy of the respective resonance is a better parameter than @xmath18 ( in the above example the k and l shells ) .",
    "in analogy to @xmath39 we define @xmath40 extending the sum over all configurations with the same respective @xmath38 regardless of the configuration of outer shells",
    ". + resonant scattering at a specific @xmath8 can generally be attributed primarily to a single specific number of electrons in lower shells , justifying the labels of the opacity peaks given in fig .",

    "this is the reason for strong ion contrast with elemental and inner shell charge state specificity in the scattering signal even at lower ion density than that of free electrons .",
    "additionally the non - resonant free and bound electrons contribute dominantly to signal in other @xmath59 regions than the resonant signal as the target keeps net neutrality on sufficiently large scales , and hence can generally be easily discriminated from the latter .",
    "a schematic setup of a laser - plasma rcxd experiment was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] with the uhi laser and xfel intersecting at the solid foil at approximately @xmath4 to each other .",
    "in such a setup the xfel penetrates the target foil in z - direction and is scattered at structures that are in the @xmath60plane , e.g. filaments , shock fronts hole - boring compressions , plasma oscillations and others .",
    "the scattering pattern can be recorded behind the target with a 2d area photon detector .",
    "a simple experimental realization of the setup could be a flat foil with the xfel beam intersecting the optical laser slightly less than normal , penetrating the foil at a shallow angle .",
    "we note that in principle the presented rcxd method could also be used in a grazing incidence saxs ( gi - saxs ) geometry with x - ray penetration and scattering limited to the foil surface .",
    "the scattering pattern contains the full mode pattern of all electron correlations as well as that of resonating ions .",
    "the real space distribution @xmath54 can eventually be reconstructed using phase retrieval algorithms or by employing more sophisticated holographic methods  @xcite .",
    "the scattering pattern @xmath61 does not only contain information on the structure of spatial ion distribution but moreover information on distribution of charge states themself and plasma temperature .",
    "this information is encoded in the relative magnitude of real and imaginary part of the optical corrections , and it manifests itself in an asymmetry of the scattering pattern . if the xfel energy @xmath8 is tuned to match a resonance in ions with a specific @xmath38 , also ions with more or less electrons in the lower shells may contribute as the resonances have a non - vanishing width ( fig .",
    "[ fig : configuration_inner_weighted ] ) .",
    "the contribution of such neighboring resonances manifests itself not only through the imaginary part of the optical correction , but also through the real part .",
    "specifically , the real part of the optical correction at the center of a resonance vanishes , so any non - vanishing real part is due to neighboring resonances .",
    "negative values of the optical correction real part are due to resonances at higher energy ( smaller @xmath38 ) while positive values are due to resonances at lower energy ( larger @xmath38 ) as the spatial distribution of ions with different values of @xmath38 is generally different , also the real part of the optical correction will be distributed differently than the imaginary part , breaking the point - symmetry @xmath62 of the scattering signal .",
    "this effect can be utilized by phase retrieval methods to retrieve the imaginary and real parts separately and hence to infer the relative amount of ions with different charge state than that selected by @xmath8 .",
    "this is especially interesting as different ionization models employed in state - of - the - art simulation codes predict different distributions , thus allowing for a direct experimental validation .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of real part to imaginary part of the optical correction , as well as relative amplitudes in a two - color xfel experiment , can be used as a thermometer for the plasma temperature .",
    "the local electron temperature , or more generally the electron energy distribution , and its temporal evolution , determines the population of individual electron configurations and therefore the spectral shape of the optical corrections  @xcite . as the number of electron holes in lower shells increases with plasma temperature , the real part of the optical correction shifts from positive for small temperatures to negative for higher temperatures . for a thermalized system",
    "this effect can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : configuration_inner_weighted ] for the example of copper ions , as simulated by scfly . the measurement of real and imaginary part of the optical correction can hence be used  in conjunction with an appropriate dynamic model  to determine the plasma temperature .",

    "all ions are ionized up to the calculated local average charge state , thus producing a narrow distribution and neglecting the spread in charge states .",
    "the di model is based on binary collisions generating a broad charge state distribution but neglects recombination and only considers ground state ionization potentials ; both models neglect internal excitations .",
    "we approximate the local distribution of configurations ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) at the xfel arrival time at the target foil @xmath69 during post - processing with scfly , computing the temperature input - parameter using the local average energy @xmath70 from the pic simulation with a time history proportional to that of the average over the simulation - box volume @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the most important parameters used for the simulations are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : parameters ] .",
    "since the pic simulations are only 2d in space we have to use a model to extend the plasma into the third dimension ( xfel propagation direction @xmath55 ) , in order to calculate the scattering signal .",
    "we define the target thickness in this direction to be @xmath73 but with only a central layer of @xmath74 thickness being resonant , while scattering in the remaining target volume only adds to the non - resonant background .",
    "additionally we assume invariance of the plasma both in the resonant and non - resonant target volume in the direction of xfel propagation .",
    "this setup corresponds to a sandwich target with the material of interest buried into material of neighboring z. the resonant layer and its thickness is chosen to be smaller than the typical structure size .",

    "this signal would be obtained far off any resonant energy and can clearly be separated in @xmath59-space from the resonant part . since the electron distribution @xmath77 is rather smooth besides the sharp surface borders , the signal structure in transverse direction is weak and does not contain much useful information .",
    "+ the resonant signals ( using only @xmath78 in ; lower right panels ) and total signals show much more structure .",
    "this is , in this specific example , due to the filaments in ion distribution and the ion front following the uhi laser pulse curvature , giving rise in the scattering pattern to transverse lines and a `` bow - tie '' like structure , respectively .",
    "depending on the specific filament spatial frequency and width the scattering structure seen in transverse direction changes ( cp .",
    "[ fig : results_e_scan ] ) , which can be used to infer the electron dynamics that imprints on ionization  @xcite as well as to benchmark ionization models .",
    "+ additionally , a strong asymmetry is seen in the resonant scattering signal which is due to a difference in ion distribution for different charge states .",
    "as shown before , ions with differing @xmath38 do not add significantly to the imaginary part of the optical correction .",
    "however , this is not strictly true for the real part .",
    "hence , the real and imaginary parts of @xmath53 are not only differing in amplitude ( as they would if considering only one charge state and neglecting non - resonant electron scattering ) , but also in phase . the strong asymmetry in the tf case",
    "is indicating that ions with different @xmath38 are spatially well separated while its absence in the case of di is due to its broad charge distribution .",
    "+ by performing a phase retrieval on the scattering pattern , the real space distribution @xmath54 could be regained , individually for the real and imaginary part as shown in fig.[fig : a_real ] for the tf case ( here directly taken from pic simulation as used to generate the scattering patterns ) . since the non - resonant signal corresponds mainly to that of a flat homogenous foil , its scattering signal is predominantly along the direction perpendicular to the foil surfaces .",
    "all signal with a transverse component are hence due to resonant scattering , and as expected the optical correction s real and imaginary part differ explaining the observed asymmetry .",
    "the real part exhibits the expected behavior in laser direction : at the foil surface the temperature is expected to be higher due to the laser irradiation , hence there should be more ions with inner shell holes ( smaller @xmath38 ) than inside the foil . with @xmath8 centered at the resonance of ions with @xmath41",
    "this means more ions with @xmath79 and hence negative real part of the optical correction at the surface and ions with @xmath80 and positive real part inside the foil .",
    "directly at the position of the ions with @xmath41 , the peak in the imaginary part , the real part is zero .    to illustrate this",
    "we demonstrate how a simple poor - man s phase retrieval can be used to derive the position , width and density of resonant ions and ions with one electron more or less in the lower shells , as well as the local plasma temperature .",

    "in this paper we have presented a novel diagnostic method that will enable for the first time to measure important quantities in laser created plasmas overcoming limitations in spatial and temporal resolution of existing diagnostics .",
    "tuning the xfel energy to a specific energy selects a specific nuclear element with specific number of electrons in the inner atomic shells that will dominate the small angle scattering signal .",
    "specificity depends on the xfel energy and plasma temperature as the individual strength of resonances depends on the temperature dependent level populations but is generally possible to be better than @xmath86 .",
    "the signals contain the full mode structure of ion - ion correlations that could be regained by numerical phase retrieval or holographic methods .",
    "the temperature sensitive variation of the opacity spectral shape can in turn be used to measure the spatial distribution of the instantaneous plasma temperature by using multiple - wavelength xfel beams , and can hence be applied for equation of state measurements .",
