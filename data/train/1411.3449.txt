    "it is clear now that during the evolution from low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) to millisecond pulsars ( msps ; e.g. , @xcite ) , a neutron star in such a system can switch between the states of being accretion - powered and rotation - powered , which is well illustrated from observational studies of the msp binary j1824@xmath02452i in the globular cluster m28 @xcite .",
    "before , indirect evidence has strongly suggested that several accreting msps in transient lmxbs probably switch to be rotation powered during their quiescent states ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the discovery of the radio msp binary j1023@xmath10038 @xcite has further shown interesting features for probably the end phase of the evolution : such a binary can switch between the states of having an accretion disk and being disk - free , while the pulsar in the binary is still active but not observable during the former state @xcite .",
    "psr j1023@xmath10038 is also a prototypical , so - called ` redback ' system @xcite .",
    "different from those ` black widow ' msp binaries ( e.g. , b1957@xmath120 ; @xcite ) that contain very low - mass ( @xmath30.02@xmath4 ) companions , redback systems have relatively massive secondaries ( @xmath30.10.6@xmath4 ) . irradiation and/or evaporation of the companion by emission and pulsar wind , respectively , from the central neutron star probably play an important role in forming black widow and redback systems @xcite .",
    "the second transitional msp binary , xss j12270@xmath04859 , was recently identified , as the accretion disk in the system was found to have disappeared since 2012 nov.dec .",
    "@xcite . discovered by the rossi x - ray timing explorer @xcite and initially thought as a cataclysmic variable @xcite , the binary was considered as a peculiar lmxb that is associated with the @xmath2-ray  source 2fgl j1227.7@xmath04853 ( @xcite and references therein ) . after its transition to be disk - free ,",
    "multiple energy observations have revealed its full nature .",
    "the detection of a 1.69 ms radio pulsar was reported @xcite .",
    "optical observations have found that its orbital period is 6.9hr @xcite , and the companion is a mid g - type , under - massive donor star with mass of 0.060.12@xmath4 @xcite , establishing it as another redback system . at x - ray energies ,",
    "the binary is an order of magnitude fainter than before , with orbital modulation present @xcite . comparing to",
    "that seen in j1023 + 0038 in the disk - free state @xcite , the x - ray emission likely has an intrabinary - shock origin @xcite , due to the interaction between the outflow from the companion and the pulsar wind . at @xmath2-ray  energies ,",
    "a possible flux decrease was also reported in an astronomer s telegram @xcite .",
    "these properties are highly comparable to that of j1023 + 0038 , particularly since the latter system just underwent a transition to the active accretion state in 2013 june and extensive observational studies have been conducted @xcite .",
    "the source field of 2fgl j1227.7@xmath04853 was found to contain three radio sources @xcite .",
    "the brightest one j122806@xmath0485218 has extended radio emission , although its radio properties likely do not support the classification of it being a blazer @xcite , the class for which is the major population ( @xmath380% ) detected by _ fermi _ in its large area telescope ( lat ) second source catalog @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations did not reveal any physical connection between xss j12270@xmath04859 and j122806@xmath0485216 , but found a possible , previously uncatalogued galaxy cluster that is located approximately 1   away from the former @xcite .",
    "previously , @xcite and @xcite have analyzed approximately 2-yr and 4-yr _ fermi _ data for 2fgl j1227.7@xmath04853 , respectively , and mainly studied its @xmath2-ray  spectral properties .",
    "given above and the recent identification of the transitional msp binary nature for xss  j12270@xmath04859 , detailed analysis of the _ fermi _ data is needed , which possibly helps our understanding of the physical processes in this system .",
    "we have carried out the analysis to identify the properties of the associated @xmath2-ray  source , study its long - term flux variability , and search for modulation signals . in this paper , we report the results from the analysis .",

    ". we kept events during the time period from 2008 - 08 - 04 15:43:36 ( utc ) to 2014 - 07 - 10 18:16:37 ( utc ) and in the energy range of 100mev to 300gev .",
    "in addition , only events with zenith angle less than 100deg and during good time intervals were selected .",
    "the former prevents the earth s limb contamination , and for the latter , the quality of the data was not affected by the spacecraft events .",
    "we included all sources within 16 deg in the _ fermi _ second source catalog @xcite centered at the position of xss j12270@xmath04859 to make the source model .",
    "the spectral function forms of the sources are provided in the catalog .",
    "the spectral normalization parameters of the sources within 8 deg from xss j12270@xmath04859 were set free , and all other parameters of the sources were fixed at their catalog values .",
    "we used the spectrum model gll_iem_v05_rev1.fits and the spectrum file iso_source_v05.txt for the galactic and the extragalactic diffuse emission , respectively , in the source model .",
    "the normalizations of the diffuse components were set as free parameters .    using the lat science tools software package v9r33p0 , we performed standard binned likelihood analysis to the lat data in the @xmath60.2gev range .",
    "events below 200 mev were rejected because of the relative large uncertainties of the instrument response function of the lat in the low energy range .",
    "we extracted the test statistic ( ts ) map of a @xmath7 region centered at the position of xss j12270@xmath04859 ( figure  [ fig : tsmap ] ) , with all sources in the source model considered except the candidate @xmath2-ray counterpart ( 2fgl j1227.7@xmath04853 ) to xss j12270@xmath04859 .",
    "the ts value at a specific position , calculated from ts@xmath8 ( where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the maximum likelihood values for a model without and with an additional source respectively ) , is a measurement of the fit improvement for including the source , and is approximately the square of the detection significance of the source @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : tsmap ] , the @xmath2-ray emission near the center was detected with ts@xmath111440 , indicating @xmath337@xmath12 detection significance .",

    "this best - fit position is consistent with the 2mass position of xss j12270@xmath04859 ( mark by a dark cross in figure  [ fig : tsmap ] ) .",
    "the offset between the two positions is only @xmath3001 .",
    "the nearby radio source j122806@xmath0485218 and possible galaxy cluster j122807.4@xmath048532 are also within the 2@xmath12 error circle , which are @xmath11004 and @xmath11003 away from the best - fit position , respectively .    including the @xmath2-ray  source in the source model at the 2mass position of xss j12270@xmath04859 , we performed standard binned likelihood analysis to the lat data in @xmath60.2 gev range , with emission of this source modeled with a simple power law and an exponentially cutoff power law ( characteristic of pulsars ) . for the former model , photon index @xmath130.03 with a ts@xmath14 value of @xmath31446",
    "was obtained , and for the latter , @xmath150.08 and cutoff energy @xmath162 gev , with a ts@xmath17 value of @xmath31466 , were obtained .",

    "the low - energy cutoff was thus detected with @xmath64@xmath12 significance ( estimated from @xmath18 , where ts@xmath19 ) .",
    "the result favors the association of the @xmath2-ray source with the pulsar binary system xss j12270@xmath04859 .",
    "we obtained the light curve of the source in @xmath60.2 gev energy range to search for flux variations , particularly around the state - transition time period of xss j12270@xmath04859 . a point source with @xmath20 power - law emission (   [ subsec : si ] ) at the 2mass position",
    "was considered .",
    "significant variations before the state change ( mjd 56245 ) are seen in the 30-day time interval light curve . in figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] , the light curve as well as the ts curve are shown .",
    "the flux has a factor of 3 variations ( 26@xmath2110@xmath22photons@xmath23 s@xmath24 ) , while ts varies between 1070 .",
    "after the state change ( around mjd 56283 ) , @xmath2-ray emission was relatively stable , with the flux and ts being @xmath32@xmath2110@xmath22photons@xmath23 s@xmath24 and @xmath320 for most of the time .",
    "we noted that there were two unreliable data points at the time bins of mjd 5657356603 and 5666356693 .",
    "the obtained ts values are smaller than 1 ( marked by open symbols in figure  [ fig : lc ] ) . during the times , there were two target - of - opportunity observations causing data gaps of @xmath35 and @xmath312 days , respectively .",
    "to further investigate the flux variations during the transition time period , we constructed a 30-day light curve by shifting each time interval by 1 day forward and obtaining the flux during such a 30-day interval ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting fine smooth light curve is shown in the inset box of figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "a factor of 2 flux decrease , from @xmath25 to @xmath26photons@xmath23 s@xmath24 , is clearly visible .",
    "therefore 2fgl  j1227.7@xmath04853 had a flux change related to the state transition .",
    "we performed standard binned likelihood analysis to the lat data in @xmath60.2 gev range for the time periods before and after the state change . when a power - law spectrum was assumed for the former data , we found @xmath27 with ts@xmath28 1247 and for the latter , @xmath29 with a ts@xmath28 183 .",
    "when an exponentially cutoff power law was considered , the respective results were @xmath300.08 and @xmath312 gev with ts@xmath32 1262 , and @xmath330.3 and @xmath341 gev with ts@xmath32 192",
    ". therefore the low - energy cutoff was detected with ts@xmath35 values of @xmath1115 and @xmath119 , which correspond to the detection significance of @xmath36 and @xmath37 before and after the state change , respectively .",
    "these results indicate that the @xmath2-ray emission from the source is likely better described by a spectrum characteristic of pulsars , and the emission after the state transition is harder . for the exponentially cutoff power - law spectra , the @xmath60.2 gev",
    "@xmath2-ray fluxes were 3.2@xmath380.2 @xmath21 10@xmath22 and 1.7@xmath380.2 @xmath21 10@xmath22 photons@xmath23s@xmath24 during the time periods before and after the state change , respectively .",
    "these results are summarized in table  [ tab : likelihood ] .",
    "we report our spectrum results of the @xmath2-ray  source by considering the emission as a point source with a power - law spectrum at the 2mass position .",
    "the photon index was fixed to the value we obtained above using the total data ( see table  [ tab : likelihood ] ) .",
    "the spectrum was extracted by performing maximum likelihood analysis to the lat data in 10 evenly divided energy bands in logarithm from 0.1300 gev .",
    "only spectral points with ts@xmath394 were kept .",
    "we extracted @xmath2-ray spectra for the time periods before and after the state change , respectively .",
    "the obtained spectra are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , and the energy flux values are given in table  [ tab : spectrum - point ] .    in order to investigate the variability before the state transition , we also extracted @xmath2-ray spectra from the data in the time intervals of ts@xmath3935 ( ` high ' state ) and ts@xmath4020 ( ` low ' state ) .",
    "the obtained spectra are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , with the energy flux values given in table  [ tab : spectrum - point ] . comparing the two spectra , while the source appeared brighter across the whole energy range in the high state , the flux at 0.33gev , showing a @xmath115@xmath12 difference , had the most significant change .",
    "we performed timing analysis to the lat data of xss j12270@xmath04859 to search for possible orbital modulations .",
    "considering the x - ray orbital modulation was only detected after the state change @xcite , we first folded the lat data of the @xmath2-ray  source during the time period at the optical orbital frequency of 4.01850@xmath41hz ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the 2mass position of xss j12270@xmath04859 was used for the barycentric corrections to photon arrival times , and photons within 12 from the position were collected .",
    "different energy ranges ( e.g. , @xmath60.2 , @xmath60.3 , @xmath60.5 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 gev ) were tested in folding .",
    "we found that the highest orbital signal was revealed in the @xmath60.3 gev energy range .",
    "the folded light curve , which has an h - test value of @xmath310 ( corresponding to 3@xmath12 detection significance ) , is shown in figure  [ fig : timing ] .",
    "the phase zero is set at the ascending node of the pulsar in xss j12270@xmath04859 .",
    "although the significance is not high , we note that the folded light curve is nearly aligned with the x - ray one given in @xcite , which strengthens the modulation detection .",
    "the result thus provides strong evidence for the association of the @xmath2-ray source with xss j12270@xmath04859 .    as a test",
    ", we also folded the lat data of xss j12270@xmath04859 before the state change at the optical orbital frequency .",
    "no significant @xmath2-ray modulation was detected ( the h - test values were @xmath30.3 ) .",
    "we made two @xmath60.3 gev ts maps over the phase ranges of 0.10.4 ( named phase i ) and 0.60.9 ( named phase ii ) , which approximately are the bottom and peak , respectively , of the orbital modulation ( figure  [ fig : timing ] ) .",
    "the obtained ts maps are shown in figure  [ fig : tsmap - phase ] .",
    "the source during phase ii is more significantly detected than during phase i , as the ts values are @xmath1176 and @xmath1120 , respectively .",
    "we also ran _ gtfindsrc _ to determine the positions of the @xmath2-ray emission during the two phases , and found that they are consistent with the position of xss j12270@xmath04859 within 2@xmath12 error circles .",
    "the analysis confirms the detection of orbital modulation from the photon folding .",
    "spectra during phase i and phase ii were also obtained , but due to limited numbers of photons , the uncertainties on the flux data points are too large to allow any further detailed analysis .",
    "from our analysis of the _ fermi _ data of 2fgl j1227.7@xmath04853 , we have detected a flux decrease during the state transition of xss j12270@xmath04859 , which occurred around 2012 nov.dec .. we have also detected orbital modulation , although weakly , only in the data after the transition , consistent with the result from the x - ray observation @xcite .",
    "both detections are strong evidence for the assocation between the two sources .",
    "in addition , the exponentially cutoff power - law model , which is a typical spectrum for pulsar emission at the _ fermi _  lat @xmath2-ray  energy range @xcite , is preferred to describe the source s emission during both before and after the transition time periods .",
    "this result supports the association as well .",
    "given these , our analysis has confirmed the previous identification that 2fgl j1227.7@xmath04853 is the @xmath2-ray  counterpart to xss j12270@xmath04859 @xcite .    from extensive observations , particularly at @xmath2-ray  band , of the state transition of psr j1023 + 0038 that occurred in 2013 june , it has been learned that in the state of having an accretion disk , @xmath2-ray  emission is brighter than that in the disk - free state : there was an order of magnitude flux increase in j1023 + 0038 accompanying the state transition @xcite .",
    "what we have detected in xss j12270@xmath04859 is the opposite to that of the j1023 + 0038 case in 2013 , while the flux change is smaller , as the flux in the latter state is approximately two - times lower than that in the former .",
    "it is very likely that @xmath2-ray  emission in the disk - free state originates from the magnetosphere of the pulsar , while the brighter emission in the accretion state has been proposed to be due to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of a cold pulsar wind off the optical / infrared photons from the accretion disk @xcite or self - synchrotron compton processes at the magnetospheric region of a propellering neutron star @xcite .",
    "similar to that in j1023 + 0038 , @xmath42 and @xmath43gev to 1.4@xmath380.6 and 0.7@xmath380.4gev from the accretion state to disk - free state , spectral changes were also detected in xss j12270@xmath04859 , as @xmath44 and @xmath45gev in the former changed to @xmath111.8 and @xmath112gev in the latter . although the large uncertainties do not allow us to draw a clear conclusion , the measurements are possible evidence for that the exact same physical processes occurred in xss j12270@xmath04859 .    probably because j12270@xmath04859 is approximately 3 times brighter than j1023 + 0038 in the disk - free state @xcite , we have likely detected its orbital modulation .",
    "such @xmath2-ray  modulation , which was seen marginally in the black widow binary psr b1957 + 20 ( and the candidate msp binary 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , has been suggested to arise due to the view angle of the intrabinary interaction region @xcite .",
    "however the modulation , approximately aligned with that at x - rays @xcite , has the brightness peak in the orbital phase of 0.51.0 ( around the superior conjunction when the companion is behind the neutron star ) .",
    "this orbital variation is different from that in b1957 + 20 , as its brightness peak is at the opposite phase region . in the latter case",
    "the inverse compton processes , which produces extra @xmath2-ray  emission around the inferior conjunction phase , has been suggested to be viewed as a head - on collision between the pulsar wind and the soft photons from the pulsar or the companion @xcite . for xss",
    "j12270@xmath04859 , we suspect its modulation may arise because of the occultation of the photon emitting region by the companion , which well explains the x - ray modulation in psr j1023 + 0038 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we note that the inclination angle of the binary was estimated to be 4565@xcite , also similar to that of psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the photon counts were too low to allow a comparison of the phase - resolved spectra ( obtained in the bright and faint phase ranges ) , which might help identify the cause of the modulation .",
    "if it were due to the occultation , no spectral changes would be expected .",
    "in addition to the flux change related to the state transition , our data analysis shows that @xmath2-ray  emission from xss j12270@xmath04859 may not be stable before the state change , possibly having a factor of 3 flux variations in its long - term light curve .",
    "the spectrum comparison between the high ( with ts greater than 35 ) and low ( with ts lower than 20 ) states only indicates the possible presence of an extra component around 0.33gev ; otherwise similar flux changes were across the whole energy range .",
    "such flux variations are not seen before in msp binaries . recently in the candidate msp binary 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530 , significant flux variations were detected but that was caused by the presence of a 23gev component in the high state @xcite . given that there are three radio sources and a possible galaxy cluster in the source field , contamination from them can not be totally excluded .",
    "if one of them is associated with an unidentified blazer , which would have caused the flux changes across the _ fermi _ energy range due to its variability ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the flux variations would instead indicate the contamination . in order to determine this possibility by detecting any related flux changes at radio or x - ray energies , multi - wavelength observations",
    "can be carried out when 2fgl j1227.7@xmath04853 shows significant brightening again .",
