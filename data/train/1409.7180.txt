    "the kondo effect is an important issue in condensed - matter physics @xcite and has been attracted extensive attention since its first discovery , because the kondo effect could provide a deeper understanding of the physical properties of many strong correlated systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a quasi - zero - dimensional system called quantum dot ( qd ) , of which the parameters can be modulated experimentally in a continuous and reproducible manner , offers proper platform to study the kondo problems @xcite . under appropriate conditions ,",
    "the kondo effect can arise from the coherent superposition of the cotunneling processes @xcite , where the spin degree of freedom plays a significant role and the electron in the qd can flip its spin . at low temperature , the coherent superposition of many cotunneling processes could lead to the kondo resonant state in which the spin flip occurs frequently within the qd and a very sharp kondo peak emerges in the density of state of the qd .    later on ,",
    "the kondo effect was proposed based on the orbital degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "it was reported that double qd ( dqd ) could become a good candidate for realizing the orbital kondo effect @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the energy of the orbital state in the left qd can be the same as or very close to that in the right qd . then , the corresponding left and right orbital states are degenerate or near degenerate , and they can be regarded as pseudospin degenerate states @xcite . in real spin systems , it is difficult to manipulate the spin - up state and the spin - down one individually .",
    "in contrast , since the left and right qds of the dqd system are separated in space , it is much easier to control over both qds and each of them can be seen as a pseudospin component @xcite . as a result , the physical phenomenon , which is related to the spin degree of freedom , may also be realized in the dqd system including the pseudospin ( orbital ) degree of freedom .",
    "very recently , the pseudospin - resolved transport spectroscopy of the kondo effect has been observed in a dqd device on the basis of a orbital degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the schematic diagram of this device is shown in figure [ fig1](a ) . in the experiment ,",
    "the authors fabricated the parallel dqd system from an epitaxially grown algaas / gaas heterostructure .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig1](a ) , q@xmath0 and q@xmath1 are the parallel qds , which are capacitively coupled with each other .",
    "the voltages applied on the gates p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 are used to control the occupancy of the dots .",
    "the gates w@xmath2 ( w@xmath3 ) and w@xmath4 ( w@xmath5 ) control the tunneling rates between dot q@xmath0 ( q@xmath1 ) and its source lead @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and drain lead @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . the gates c@xmath10 and c@xmath11 are used to control the interdot tunneling . in @xcite , the authors applied negative voltages on the gates",
    "c@xmath10 and c@xmath11 to make the interdot tunneling negligible .",
    "they measured the standard transport spectroscopy as a function of the bias voltages and observed a zero - bias peak in the conductance . furthermore ,",
    "if the orbital degeneracy is broken , the kondo resonances have different pseudospin character .",
    "using pseudospin - resolved spectroscopy , they observed a kondo peak at only one sign of the bias voltage .",
    "in this paper , we theoretically investigate the orbital kondo effect in a parallel dqd .",
    "it need to mention that the properties of dqds have been studied by lots of theoretical works @xcite . in this work , by using the non - equilibrium green s function method and the equation of motion technique , the formula of the conductance for each pseudospin component and the pseudospin flipping current are obtained .",
    "the main new results are listed as follows : ( 1 ) if the interdot tunneling coupling @xmath12 is zero , we reproduce the experimental results in @xcite , where two kondo peaks were observed in the conductance - bias curve for the pseudospin - non - resolved case and only one kondo peak was found in the pseudospin - resolved case . in the curve of the conductance versus the pseudospin splitting energy , there exist three and two kondo peaks for the pseudospin - non - resolved and pseudospin - resolved cases , respectively . ( 2 ) when the interdot tunneling coupling @xmath12 is nonzero , the levels in the dqd can form molecular states . then",
    ", the kondo peaks can emerge at @xmath13 for both pseudospin - non - resolved and pseudospin - resolved cases , where @xmath14 is the energy difference between the two molecular states and @xmath15 is the lead voltage .",
    "besides , an additional kondo peak and dip structure could emerge at @xmath16 . (",
    "3 ) the pseudospin transport and the pseudospin flipping current in the dqd system are studied . in particular , the pseudospin system is much easier to be controlled and measured than the real spin current , so the pseudospin dqd system can be a good candidate for studying the properties related to the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : models ] , we propose the model hamiltonian , and use the non - equilibrium green s function method to get the current and conductance formulas . in section [ sec : discussions ] , we numerically investigate the conductances and the pseudospin flipping current of the dqd in different cases . finally , we give the conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "the gates p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 are used to control the occupancy of the qds .",
    "the tunneling rates between dot q@xmath0 ( q@xmath1 ) and its source lead @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and drain lead @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are controlled by gates w@xmath2",

    ", the temperature keeps @xmath23 and @xmath24.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      the hamiltonian of the dqd system as shown in figure [ fig1](a ) can be written as @xmath25    where @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the hamiltonian of the dqd and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the electron in the qds with @xmath30 representing left and right .",
    "@xmath31 is the energy level of the qds , @xmath32 is the interdot electron - electron interaction , and @xmath33 is the tunneling coupling .",
    "@xmath34 denotes the tunneling between the dqd and the leads .",
    "@xmath35(@xmath36 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the electron in the leads , with @xmath37 being source and drain .",
    "@xmath38 describes the noninteracting leads .",
    "it should be noted that when a high magnetic field is applied to the qd , the spin splitting energy can be comparable with or even larger than the qd energy level spacing @xcite .",
    "then , as compared with the low energy spin state , the opposite spin state does not affect the transport property of the system at low bias .",
    "thus , we can neglect the spin degree of freedom .",
    "meanwhile , we consider the low bias case with its value being less than the intradot electron - electron interaction energy @xmath39 . in this case , there is only one eigenstate in each qd in the bias window .",
    "then , we can absorb the intradot interaction @xmath40 into the energy levels @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite . as a result , both the spin degree of freedom and the intradot interaction",
    "can be ignored , leaving only the interdot interaction @xmath32 .",
    "this approximation has been adopted in @xcite .",
    "this model can describe various properties of the parallel dqd , including the properties illustrated in the recent experiment of @xcite , and could also be used to study the pseudospin transport . here , we briefly introduce the concept of the pseudospin transport in the parallel dqd .",
    "as we know , the electron has two spin states : spin up and spin down .",
    "the transport related to spin is called spin transport .",
    "similarly , the electron in the dqd also has two states : the electron in the left qd and that in the right qd .",
    "when the electron is in the left ( right ) qd , we can call it the pseudospin up ( down ) state . the transport related to the pseudospin",
    "is called the pseudospin transport .",
    "there are four advantages of the pseudospin transport : ( 1 ) the electrons with different spins have the same chemical potential in the wires , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "thus , it is difficult to manipulate the electrons with specific spin while keeping the other spin unchanged .",
    "even if we can achieve the case of @xmath44 by some special methods @xcite , the spin voltage @xmath45 is still difficult to control . while regarding the pseudospin , however , the situation is totally different .",
    "the voltages applied on the wires connected to the left and right qds can be manipulated separately .",
    "this means that the chemical potentials of the electrons with different pseudospins , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , can be easily controlled , which has been realized in the experiment @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) since the energy levels of different qds can be manipulated by the gates p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 , the pseudospin splitting energy @xmath48 can be adjusted in a wide range . ( 3 ) the pseudospin flipping strength @xmath33 in the dqd can also be tuned by the gates c@xmath49 and c@xmath50 .",
    "it can be open or closed by simply tuning the gate voltages .",
    "( 4 ) the real spin in the lead is difficult to keep its direction and the spin flipping exists inevitably .",
    "contrarily , the pseudospin can keep its  direction \" steadily outside the dqd because the electrons in the left lead can not tunnel into the right lead and vice versa .",
    "so the pseudospin flipping current in the dqd can accurately be measured in the experiment .",
    "next , we will use the standard equation of motion technique to solve the retarded green s function @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion is : @xmath51\\vert\\hat{b } \\rangle\\rangle^{r},\\label{eq:1b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are arbitrary operators , and @xmath54 is the standard notation of the retarded green s function . since higher order green s functions will appear in the calculations of equation of motion , a decoupling schemes is needed .",
    "the decoupling scheme in this work takes the following rules : ( 1 ) if we use @xmath55 to represent the leads operator ( @xmath36 and @xmath35 ) and use @xmath56 to represent the dqds operator ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) , then we take @xmath59 .",
    "( 2 ) if the two - particle green s function involves two leads operators , then we take @xmath60 .",
    "( 3 ) if the two - particle green s function involves only one leads operator , which is @xmath61 , we continue to apply the equation of motion until all the two - particle green s functions contain two leads operators .",
    "this decoupling scheme has been used in previous papers @xcite .    moreover , because the method of derivation we used are similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we omit the detailed derivation and only show the results in this paper . it should be pointed out that although we use the same calculation method with ref .",
    "@xcite , the research subject and conclusions are totally different . ref .",
    "@xcite described the series dqds , while the present work refers to the parallel dqds . unlike the series dqds in ref .",
    "@xcite , the conductance can hold a pseudospin - resolved character in the paralell dqds system when the interdot tunnelling @xmath24 . the pseudospin transport and the pseudospin flipping current",
    "can also be studied in the present model while @xmath62 , and the calculation presents a new method to measure and control the pseudospin transport in the parallel dqds system .    in addtion , it is worth mentioning that although the equation of motion method based on non - equilibrium green s function can not quantitatively obtain the intensity of the kondo effect , it can give the qualitative physics and the positions of the kondo peaks .",

    "however , when @xmath12 is increased , this peak moves to @xmath170 . besides , the kondo peak at @xmath171 also emerges , and its height becomes higher and higher .",

    "thus , there is only one broadening peak around @xmath119 .",
    "then , by further increasing @xmath12 , the height of this broadening peak decreases until this peak vanishes .",

    ", a steady spin current can not be held easily . on the other hand , the measurement of the spin current is also difficult .",
    "thus , it limits the development of the research field on the spin transport .",
    "the orbital kondo effect , which is a pseudospin kondo effect , can be regarded as the counterpart of the spin kondo effect .",
    "the kondo effect , whose emergence is originally related to the spin degree of freedom , can also be realized in the system with the orbital degree of freedom .",
    "this indicates that we may use a system , including the orbital degree of freedom , to study the physical properties which are difficult to be observed with the spin degree of freedom . in the dqd system ,",
    "the current flow in the leads @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is easy to measure , which means that the pseudospin current is easy to measure .",
    "furthermore , the pseudospin flipping only happens in the qds and its flipping strength is controllable and tunable .",
    "when the current flows in the leads , it can not tunnel from the left side ( @xmath6 and @xmath8 ) to the right side ( @xmath7 and @xmath9 ) , which indicates that the pseudospin current is conserved in the leads .",
    "thus , it is possible and convenient to use the orbital degree of freedom to study the properties related to the spin degree of freedom .",
    "it should be pointed out that , when @xmath62 , the currents in the leads @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 , and @xmath9 may not be equal to each other , but they still satisfy the relation @xmath189 due to the electric current conservation . here",
    ", we define that the positive direction of the current is flowing into the dqd for the source leads and is going out from the dqd for the drain leads .",
    "besides , we introduce the pseudospin flipping current @xmath190 , which describes the current from the right qd to the left one .",
    "the relation between @xmath190 and the four wire currents are @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",

    "it is clear that when only @xmath15 is changed , the pseudospin flipping current @xmath185 is considerable as compared with the current in the four leads , because the pseudospin - up chemical potential @xmath195 is not equal to the pseudospin - down one @xmath196 , i.e. , there exists a pseudospin bias @xmath197 . on the other hand ,",
    "when both @xmath15 and @xmath112 are changed , the pseudospin flipping current @xmath185 is negligible , because the pseudospin bias @xmath198 is zero .",

    "the magnitude of this pseudospin current is not small , and in particular it is easy to be controlled and measured .    at last , in order to see the characteristics of the pseudospin flipping in the dqd more clearly , we calculate the flipping conductance which is defined as @xmath199/v .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that in the above definition , only the left source and drain voltages are changed by @xmath200 .",

    "the results exhibit the following features : ( 1 ) no matter whether @xmath112 is changed with @xmath15 or not , the kondo peaks and dips of @xmath188 emerge at @xmath120 and @xmath167 ; ( 2 ) with increasing of @xmath12 , @xmath188 is enhanced in usual ; ( 3 ) the dips are much sharper when @xmath15 is changed only , which also indicates that we can focus on the pseudospin - resolved transport spectroscopy when we study the pseudospin flipping current in the parallel dqd systems .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the orbital kondo effect in a parallel double quantum dot .",
