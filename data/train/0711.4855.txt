    "the formation and evolution scenarios of the milky way galaxy still remain among the most important unsolved problems in contemporary astrophysics @xcite .",
    "one promising way for us to better understand , and to possibly make progress towards addressing these issues is by studying globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "gcs are generally considered the fossils of the galactic formation and evolution processes , since they form during the very early stages of their host galaxy s evolution @xcite .",
    "gcs are very dense , gravitationally bound spherical systems of several thousands to more than a million stars .",
    "they can be observed out to much greater distances than individual stars , so that they can be used , and are in fact the ideal tracers , to study the properties of extragalactic systems .",
    "the most distant gc systems that have been studied to date are those in the coma cluster ; for instance , @xcite presented gc counts in the bright elliptical galaxy ngc 4881 ( at a distance of @xmath4 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on _",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst)_/wfpc2 observations . using data of similar quality",
    ", @xcite , @xcite and @xcite published a series of papers on the gcs in ngc  4874 and ic 4051 , the central cd galaxy and a giant elliptical galaxy in the coma cluster , respectively .",
    "located at a distance of about 780 kpc @xcite , m31 is the nearest and largest spiral galaxy in the local group of galaxies .",
    "it contains 337 confirmed gcs and 688 gc candidates @xcite , thus allowing us access to a much larger number of gcs than in our own galaxy .",
    "however , despite the difference in gc numbers , from the observational evidence collected so far , the m31 gcs and their galactic counterparts reveal some striking similarities @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite embarked on a new systematic wide - field ccd survey of m31 gcs , and found 1164 gcs and gc candidates  of which 559 are previously known gcs and 605 newly - found gc candidates ; based on survey data from the canada france hawaii telescope and wide field camera on the isaac newton telescope , @xcite combined his detailed analysis of the m31 gc system with recent results based on the galaxy s stellar halo , and concluded that m31 and the milky way are rather more similar than previously thought . therefore , studying the properties of the gcs in m31 may not only improve our understanding of the formation and structure of our nearest large neighbour galaxy , but also that of our own galaxy . however , there are also significant differences between the gc systems of the milky way and m31 : in particular , m31 has a much larger population of gcs than the milky way ; there are populations of `` faint fuzzies '' and extended gcs in the outer halo of m31 that are not seen in the milky way , and there is a population of young to intermediate - age gcs in m31 that are ( again ) not seen in the milky way again .    a reliable estimate of the reddening , caused by dust contamination , is important for the study of the stellar population of a given gc , in order to obtain its intrinsic spectral energy distribution . in general , on galaxy - wide scales dust",
    "tends to be distributed close the the galactic plane in galactic discs .",
    "therefore , the disc clusters are most affected by extinction due to dust in the galactic disc ( in addition to the effects due to galactic foreground extinction ) . a reliable estimate of the extinction caused by galactic material along a given line of sight can be obtained from the reddening maps of @xcite and @xcite . however , a reliable estimate of the internal extinction in a given galaxy is not easy to obtain . more specifically , although there were some ways in which to deal with the problem of determining the reddening toward the gcs in m31 prior to the publication of @xcite , some may not have been fully satisfactory . for example",
    ", @xcite assumed a uniform reddening for the clusters when he pioneered integrated - light spectroscopy of m31 gcs , whereas @xcite assumed gcs to have a single intrinsic colour when using them as reddening probes ; some authors ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) assumed that the halo gcs in m31 were only affected by galactic foreground extinction , based on which they then averaged the intrinsic colours of the halo gcs and subtracted this value from the observed colours to obtain the reddening values for all the gcs ( see details in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there are also two other ways to determine the reddening of m31 clusters , which seem reasonable but they have only been applied to a handful of clusters : @xcite estimated the individual reddening for 35 clusters using the reddening - free parameter @xmath5 , based on unpublished spectroscopic data by l. searle ; @xcite used the intrinsic colours of the 35 clusters obtained by @xcite to calibrate @xmath6 as a function of spectroscopic slope parameter @xmath7 of the continuum between @xmath8 4000 and 5000  , and then determined the intrinsic colours for about 40 gcs and gc candidates .",
    "@xcite presented a new catalogue of photometric and spectroscopic data of m31 gcs , and determined the reddening for each individual cluster using correlations between optical and infrared colours and metallicity , and by defining various `` reddening - free '' parameters based on this catalogue .",
    "@xcite found that the m31 and galactic gc extinction laws ( see their table 6 ) , and the m31 and galactic gc colour - metallicity relations are similar to each other .",
    "they then estimated the reddening to m31 objects with spectroscopic data using the relation between intrinsic optical colours and metallicity as determined for galactic clusters . for objects without spectroscopic data",
    ", they used the relationships between the reddening - free parameters and certain intrinsic colours , based on the galactic gc data .",
    "@xcite compared their results with those in the literature and confirmed that their estimated reddening values are reasonable , and quantitatively consistent with previous determinations for gcs across the entire m31 disc . in particular",
    ", @xcite showed that the distribution of reddening values as a function of position appears reasonable in that the objects with the smallest reddening are spread across the disc and halo , while the objects with the largest reddening are concentrated in the galactic disc .",
    "the reddening values for m31 clusters obtained by @xcite are widely used ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    to study the metal abundance properties of gcs can help us understand the formation and enrichment processes of their host galaxy .",
    "for example , if galaxies form as a consequence of a monolithic , dissipative and rapid collapse of a single massive , nearly - spherical spinning gas cloud in which the enrichment time - scale is shorter than the collapse time , the halo stars and gcs should show large - scale metallicity gradients @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite presented a chaotic scheme for the early evolution of a galaxy , in which loosely bound pre - enriched fragments merge with the main body of the proto - galaxy over a significant period , in which case there should be a more homogeneous metallicity distribution . at present",
    ", most galaxies are thought to have formed through a combination of both of these scenarios ( see also section 4.5 )    _ hst _ provides a unique tool for studying gcs in external galaxies .",
    "for example , based on data from the _ hst _ archive , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite showed that many large galaxies possess two or more subpopulations of gcs that have quite different chemical compositions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite presented the colour distributions of gc systems for 100 early - type galaxies from the acs virgo cluster survey , and found that , on average , galaxies at all luminosities appear to have bimodal or asymmetric gc colour / metallicity distributions .",
    "the presence of colour bimodality among these old gcs indicates that there have been at least two major star - forming mechanisms in the ( early ) histories of massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "based on the newest photometric and spectral data , in this paper we determine reliable reddening values for 443 gcs and gc candidates ( the largest gc sample in m31 used to date ) , and we also determine the metallicities for 209 gcs and gc candidates without spectroscopic observations .",
    "we then perform a statistical analysis using this gc sample .",
    "we describe the photometric and spectroscopic data for the m31 gcs in section [ data.sec ] . in section [ red.sec ] ,",
    "we determine and analyse the reddening of our m31 gc sample .",
    "section [ metal.sec ] is devoted to our statistical analysis .",
    "finally , the discussion and conclusions of this paper are presented in section [ conclu.sec ] .",
    "@xcite present the final revised bologna catalogue of m31 gcs including 337 confirmed gcs and 688 gc candidates which compose our primary sample . from a comparison with @xcite and @xcite , 89 candidates turn out not to be gcs , and these were thus removed from the sample .",
    "more recently , @xcite provided a further revision of the bologna catalogue , including a number of additional clusters in the halo of m31 .",
    "because he only provides photometry for these new clusters in two filters , we will not include these in our final sample , however ( see below regarding the photometric requirements of the method we adopt in this paper ) .",
    "the source of the photometric data utilised in this paper is from the catalogue of @xcite , i.e. the updated bologna catalogue with homogenised optical ( @xmath9 ) photometry collected from the most recent photometric references available in the literature . in this catalogue ,",
    "@xcite used the @xmath9 photometry from @xcite as a reference to obtain the master catalogue of photometric measurements as homogeneously as possible .",
    "in addition , @xcite identified 693 known and candidate gcs in m31 using the 2mass database , and included their 2mass @xmath10 magnitudes , transformed to the cit photometric system @xcite .",
    "@xcite compile a final table including the @xmath11 photometric data for the 337 confirmed and 688 candidate gcs in m31 ( their table 2 ) , which is the photometric database we use in this paper .",
    "@xcite obtained spectroscopy of 150 m31 gcs with the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) .",
    "the system they used has a resolution of 89  and enhanced blue sensitivity .",
    "their observations extend to the atmospheric cut - off at 3200  , since many of the strongest and most metallicity - sensitive spectral features of interest are in the uv .",
    "@xcite determined the metallicities for these 150 gcs using six absorption - line indices from integrated cluster spectra , following @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined the metallicities of 61 m31 gcs and gc candidates using the keck low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) and the mmt blue channel spectrograph .",
    "they computed the absorption - line indices using the method of @xcite .",
    "@xcite combined the measured indices based on the metallicity calibration from @xcite , in order to determine metallicities .",
    "their metallicities were found to be consistent with those of @xcite . finally , @xcite compiled a catalogue of spectroscopic metallicities for 188 m31 gcs.huchra/m31globulars/m31glob.dat ]    @xcite determined the metallicities of 201 gcs in m31 using the wide - field fibre optic spectrograph ( wyffos ) at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope .",
    "they calculated 12 absorption - line indices following the method of @xcite . by comparison of the line indices with the previously published m31 gc [ fe / h ] values of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", @xcite found that the line indices of the ch ( g band ) , mg  @xmath12 and fe53 lines best represent the metal abundances of their observed targets .",
    "they determined the final metallicities of these gcs based on an unweighted mean of the [ fe / h ] values calculated from the g band , mg  @xmath12 , and fe53 line strengths .",
    "there are some gcs in our sample for which the metallicities were determined in two or three of the studies mentioned above .",
    "to use all the metallicities as coherently as possible , we use the metallicities of @xcite whenever available , since @xcite present the largest ( homogeneous ) sample of m31 gc metallicities . for the metallicities determined by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "there is only one gc in common , object b328 . @xcite and @xcite determined its metallicity at @xmath13=-1.22\\pm0.80 $ ] and @xmath14=-1.51\\pm0.28 $ ] , respectively .",
    "we adopt the metallicity from @xcite , given its smaller associated uncertainty .",
    "overall , we obtained metallicities for 295 m31 gcs , which we list in table [ t1.tab ] .",
    "we will refer to these data as our spectroscopic metallicity catalogue ( hereafter smcat ) .",
    "we will use the smcat to perform our statistical analysis .",
    "@xcite and @xcite determined the gc metallicities using the metallicity calibration defined in @xcite .",

    "the kmm test allows us to distinguish between the metal - poor and metal - rich subsamples , i.e. , the kmm test gives [ fe / h]=-1.18 dex as the dividing line between the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs . however , there are about 54 objects that exhibit intermediate probabilities of membership in both groups ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "since it is difficult to decide unequivocally which group these objects belong to , we simply adopted the dividing line between metal - poor and metal - rich gcs from the kmm test .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the projected spatial distributions of the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs in m31 . using eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) , we obtained the distances to our sample clusters from the centre of m31 . from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , it is clear that the metal - rich gcs in m31 are more centrally concentrated , consistent with what was found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the metal - poor gcs appear to occupy a more extended halo , although also with a general concentration following the outline of the m31 disc .",
    "the latter may have been caused by selection biases , i.e. , from fig .",

    "[ fig11 ] shows the histograms of the metal - poor and metal - rich populations . a notable shortage of metal - poor clusters in the innermost radial bins",
    "can clearly be seen , which is also consistent with the results of @xcite . in the milky way ,",
    "the metal - rich gcs reveal significant rotation and have historically been associated with the thick - disc system @xcite ; however , other studies @xcite have suggested that metal - rich gcs within @xmath16 kpc of the galactic centre are more appropriately associated with the milky way s bulge and/or bar . in m31 , @xcite showed that the metal - rich clusters constitute a more highly flattened system than the metal - poor ones , and appear to have disc - like kinematics ; @xcite showed that the metal - rich gcs are preferentially located close to the galactic centre .",
    "@xcite also showed that the distinction between the rotation of the metal - rich and metal - poor clusters is most apparent in the inner 2 kpc .",
    "therefore , they concluded that the metal - rich clusters in m31 appear to form a central rotating disc system .",
    "@xcite performed a more comprehensive investigation into the kinematics of the m31 cluster system .",
    "they showed that the metal - rich m31 gcs appear to constitute a distinct kinematic subsystem that demonstrates a centrally concentrated spatial distribution with a high rotation amplitude , but that does not appear significantly flattened , consistent with a bulge population .",
    "@xcite performed a maximum - likelihood kinematic analysis of 166 m31 clusters taken from @xcite and found that the most significant difference between the rotation of the metal - rich and metal - poor clusters occurs at intermediate projected galactocentric radii .",
    "particularly , @xcite presented a potential thick - disc population among m31 s metal - rich gcs .",
    "the presence or absence of a radial trend in the metallicity of a gc sample is an important test of galaxy formation theories @xcite . in the @xcite galaxy formation scenario",
    ", the halo stars and gcs should show large - scale metallicity gradients @xcite ; however , in the @xcite scenario the expected metallicity distribution is more homogeneous . for the milky way , @xcite provided some evidence that metallicity gradients with both distance from the galactic plane and distance from the galactic centre are present in the disc cluster system . for m31 ,",
    "there are some inconsistent conclusions , e.g. , @xcite showed that there is little or no evidence for a correlation between metallicity and projected radius , but most of his clusters were located inside a radius of 50 arcmin ; however , some authors ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that there is evidence for a weak but measurable metallicity gradient as a function of projected radius .",
    "@xcite confirmed the latter result based on their large sample of spectral and colour - derived metallicities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , we show the metallicity of the m31 gcs as a function of galactocentric radius based on our large cluster sample . it is clear that the dominant feature of this diagram is the scatter in metallicity at any radius .",
    "however , it is also true that a trend of decreasing metallicity with increasing galactocentric distance exists , for both the metal - poor and the entire population .",
    "the slopes of the metal - poor subsample and for the entire sample are @xmath17 and @xmath18 dex arcmin@xmath19 , respectively , while for metal - rich sample , it is @xmath20 dex arcmin@xmath19 .",
    "the latter can certainly be considered as no metallicity gradient . in order to show this",
    ", we display the mean metallicity binned in 10 arcmin intervals in galactocentric radius .",
    "we can see that , within @xmath21 arcmin , the mean metallicity decreases with galactocentric radius for both the metal - poor and for the entire population .",
    "the error bars represent the standard deviations of the means .",
    "these results are in good agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that simple smooth , pressure - supported collapse models of galaxies by themselves are unlikely to fit m31 .",
    "the ( possible ) correlation between cluster mass ( or luminosity ) and metallicity is important in gc formation theory .",
    "it is generally believed that if self - enrichment is important in gcs , the most massive clusters could retain their metal - enriched supernova ejecta , so that the metal abundance should increase with cluster mass ; the opposite is true if cooling from metals determines the temperature in the cluster - forming clouds @xcite .",
    "the possible self - enrichment of gcs has been studied in detail in some aspects ( see details in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the model of gc self - enrichment developed by @xcite is particularly interesting in this context . in this model ,",
    "cold and dense clouds embedded in the hot proto - galactic medium are assumed to be the progenitors of galactic halo gcs .",
    "based on this model , @xcite suggested that the most metal - rich proto - gcs are the least massive ones .",
    "the _ hst _ provides a unique tool to study gcs in external galaxies .",
    "recently , using the acs onboard the _ hst _ , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite found that in giant ellipticals  such as m87 , ngc 4649 and ngc 7094 ( although not in ngc 4472 )  luminous blue gcs reveal a trend of having redder colours , such that more massive gcs are redder ( more metal - rich ) .",
    "this trend is referred to as the `` blue tilt '' ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this blue tilt has been interpreted as a result of self - enrichment @xcite .",
    "@xcite speculatively suggested that these gcs once possessed dark matter haloes .",
    "@xcite subsequently found that this blue tilt is also present in the sombrero spiral galaxy ( ngc 4594 ) and may extend to less luminous gcs with a somewhat shallower slope than derived by @xcite and @xcite . as @xcite pointed out",
    ", the sombrero galaxy provides the first example of this trend in a spiral galaxy , and in a galaxy found in a low - density galaxy environment .",
    "however , in these acs studies , the metal - rich ( redder ) gcs did not show a corresponding trend ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "based on high - resolution cosmological simulations including gcs , @xcite investigated the formation processes and physical properties of gc systems in galaxies , and found that luminous metal - poor clusters would develop a correlation between luminosity and metallicity if they originated from the nuclei of low - mass galaxies at high redshift .",
    "in fact , in the simulations of @xcite , the `` simulated blue tilts '' come from the assumption that luminous metal - poor clusters originate from the stellar galactic nuclei of the more massive nucleated galaxies exhibiting a luminosity - metallicity relation .",
    "it is therefore evident that , in @xcite , galaxies which experienced more accretion / merging events of nucleated low - mass galaxies are more likely to show a blue tilt .",
    "[ fig13 ] shows the diagram of gc metallicity versus dereddened apparent magnitude .",
    "it is clear that there is no obvious trend of metallicity with luminosity similar to that in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "least - squares fits show no evidence for a relationship between luminosity and metallicity in our sample clusters .",
    "in this paper , we have ( re-)determined the reddening values for 443 clusters and cluster candidates in m31 , as well as metallicities for 209 sample objects without spectroscopic observations . we have followed the methods described by @xcite , who found that the m31 and galactic extinction laws are the same within the observational errors , and that the m31 and galactic gc c - m relations are also consistent with each other .",
    "the sample of spectroscopic and photometric data used in this paper is the newest and largest to date .",
    "the spectroscopic data were obtained from the most recent references currently available and the photometric data are from the most comprehensive catalogue of m31 clusters available at present , which includes 337 confirmed gcs and 688 gc candidates . using the metallicities of the largest sample of clusters and cluster candidates at hand , we studied the properties of the m31 clusters .",
    "our main conclusions are summarised below :    1 .",
    "the reddening distribution shows that slightly more than 50 per cent of the gcs suffer from a reddening of less than @xmath22 mag , and the mean value is @xmath3 mag .",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath23 indicates that the reddening on the northwestern side of the m31 disc is greater than that on the southeastern side , which is consistent with the conclusion that the northwestern side in nearer to us .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the m31 gcs is bimodal with peaks at @xmath0}\\approx -1.7 $ ] and @xmath1 dex .",
    "the diagram of metallicities as a function of radius from the m31 centre shows a metallicity gradient for the metal - poor gcs , but no such gradient for the metal - rich gcs .",
    "4 .   the metal - rich clusters appear to constitute a centrally concentrated spatial distribution ; however , the metal - poor clusters tend to be less spatially concentrated . 5 .",
    "there is no correlation between luminosity and metallicity among our m31 sample clusters , which indicates that self - enrichment is indeed unimportant for cluster formation in m31 .",
    "we reiterate that in using the method of @xcite , there are two major unavoidable assumptions ( acknowledged by these authors ) , i.e. that in the milky way and in m31 both the extinction law and the intrinsic colours of the gcs are the same .",
    "the latter assumption seems reasonable , since there is no evidence that gcs in different galaxies have different intrinsic colours . regarding the former assumption , there is inconsistent evidence as to whether or not this is a valid assumption .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the extinction law in m31 is very similar to that in the milky way , by analysing the two major dust lanes on the near side of m31 ; however , several studies have suggested that the reddening in m31 appears to be peculiar : with @xmath24 @xcite and @xmath25 @xcite , compared to 0.72 for the same ratio in the milky way .",
    "based on a large sample of gcs with optical and near - infrared photometric data , @xcite demonstrated that the @xmath26- and @xmath27-band extinction curve of m31 is consistent with that of the milky way , with total - to - selective extinction coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , the former assumption is plausible because in the m31 disc the composition and size distribution of the large normal grains which dominate the dust mass may be similar to those in the milky way ( see for details , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as an example , we will discuss in some detail the reddening value of the m31 gc b037 ( a.k.a .",
    "037-b327 ) , which is known to be an extremely red object .",
    "there are a few references that discuss this gc , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite first noticed an extremely red colour in photographic ( @xmath29 ) and visual ( @xmath30 ) bands for b037 , and determined its absorption to be @xmath31 mag .",
    "based on the photometric data for m31 star clusters in @xmath32 , and @xmath30 of @xcite , @xcite studied the reddening values for these objects and found that b037 was the most highly reddened in his sample , with @xmath33 mag ( @xmath34 mag ) . @xcite",
    "calibrated @xmath6 as a function of spectroscopic slope parameter @xmath7 of the continuum between @xmath35 and 5000  , and then determined the intrinsic colours for about 40 gcs and gc candidates , including b037 .",
    "@xcite presented a reddening value for b037 of @xmath36 mag .",
    "armed with a large database of multicolour photometry , @xcite determined the reddening value for each individual m31 gc , including b037 , using the correlations between optical and infrared colours and metallicity based on various `` reddening - free '' parameters , and derived @xmath37 mag for b037 . using spectroscopic metallicities to predict the intrinsic colours , @xcite rederived the reddening value for this gc , @xmath38 mag .",
    "recently , @xcite determined the reddening and age of the b037 by comparing multicolour photometry with theoretical stellar population synthesis models .",
    "the reddening towards b037 determined by @xcite is @xmath39 mag .",
    "the reddening value for b037 determined in this paper is @xmath40 mag .",
    "it is clear that the consistent reddening values for b037 from different references confirm that this cluster suffers from very large extinction .",
    "in fact , @xcite showed the dust lane across the face of the cluster using an _ hst_/acs image , which may partially account for its very large reddening value ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
