    "tidal interaction between the lmc , the smc , and the galaxy have long been considered to play vital roles not only in dynamical and chemical evolution of the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) but also in the formation of the magellanic stream ( ms ) and bridge ( mb ) around the galaxy ( e.g. , westerland 1999 ; murai & fujimoto 1981 ; bekki & chiba 2005 , b05 ) . although previous theoretical and numerical studies on the lmc - smc - galaxy tidal interaction discussed extensively the origin of dynamical properties of the mb ( e.g. , gardiner & noguchi 1995 , g96 ) , they have not yet investigated so extensively the long - term formation histories of field stars and star clusters ( scs ) in the mcs .",
    "therefore , long - standing and remarkable problems related to the interplay between the lmc - smc - galaxy interaction and the formation histories of stars and scs remain unsolved ( see bekki et al . 2004a , b for the first attempts to challenge these problems ) .",
    "one of intriguing and unexplained observations on scs in the lmc is that an intermediate - age sc ( ngc 1718 ) with the estimated age of @xmath2 gyr has a distinctively low metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath3 among intermediate - age scs ( geisler et al .",
    "2003 , g03 ; grocholski et al .",
    "2006 , g06 ) .",
    "santos & piatti ( 2004 , s04 ) investigated integrated spectrophotometric properties of old and young scs and found that several young scs with ages less than 200 myr have metallicities smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "three examples of these low - metallicity objects including rolleston et al .",
    "( 1999 , r99 ) are listed in the table 1 .",
    "given the fact that the stellar metallicity of the present lmc is about @xmath5 in [ fe / h ] ( e.g. , van den bergh 2000 , v00 ; cole et al . 2005 ) , the above examples of low - metallicity , young scs are intriguing objects .",
    "no theoretical attempts however have been made to understand the origin of these intriguing objects in the lmc .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to show , for the first time , that the observed distinctively low metallicities in intermediate - age and young scs in the lmc can be possible evidences for accretion and infall of low - metallicity gas onto the lmc from the smc .",
    "based on dynamical simulations of the lmc - smc - galaxy interaction for the last 2.5 gyr , we investigate whether gas stripped from the smc as a result of the tidal interaction can pass through the central region of the lmc and consequently can play a role in the star formation history of the lmc . based on the results of the simulations , we discuss how the sporadic accretion / infall of metal - poor gas onto the lmc from the smc ( referred to as `` the magellanic squall '' ) can control recent star formation activities of the lmc .",
    ".examples of distinctively metal - poor stars and scs for the lmc and the inter - cloud region close to the lmc . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     recent observations on stellar kinematics of old stars in the smc have suggested that the smc is _ not _ a dwarf irregular with a strongly rotating stellar disk but a dwarf spheroidal / elliptical with little rotation ( harris & zaritsky 2006 ) .",
    "the smc however has been modeled as a low - luminosity disk system in previous simulations ( g96 ) . considering the above observations , we model the smc s stellar component either as a dwarf elliptical ( de ) with a spherical shape and no rotation or as a dwarf irregular ( di ) with a disky shape and rotation in the present study . the smc s stellar ( gaseous ) component with the size of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and the mass of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 )",
    "is embedded by a massive dark matter halo with the total mass of @xmath10 set to be roughly equal to @xmath11 and the `` universal '' density distribution ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) .",
    "the projected density profile of the stellar component has an exponential profile with the scale length of @xmath12 for the de and the di models .",
    "@xmath6 is fixed at 1.88 kpc so that almost no stellar streams can be formed along the ms and the mb .",
    "many dwarfs are observed to have extended hi gas disks ( e.g. , ngc 6822 ; de blok & walater 2003 ) . the smc is therefore assumed to have an outer gas disk with an uniform radial distribution , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) being key parameters that determine the dynamical evolution of the gas .",
    "the rotating ",
    "gas disk is represented by _",
    "collisionless particles _ in the present simulations , firstly because we intend to understand purely tidal effects of the lmc - smc - galaxy interaction on the smc s evolution and secondly because we compare the present results with previous ones by g96 and connors et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for which the `` gas '' was represented by collisionless particles .",
    "although we investigate models with different @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we show the results of the models with @xmath19 and 3 and @xmath20 and 4 for which the magellanic stream with a gas mass of @xmath21 can be reproduced reasonably well .",
    "the baryonic mass fraction ( @xmath22 ) thus changes according to the adopted @xmath17 . owing to the adopted @xmath20 and 4 , a very little amount of stars in the smc can be transferred into the lmc for the last 2.5 gyr .    the initial spin of the smc s gas disk in a model is specified by two angles , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath23 is the angle between the @xmath25-axis and the vector of the angular momentum of the disk and @xmath24 is the azimuthal angle measured from @xmath26-axis to the projection of the angular momentum vector of the disk onto the @xmath27 plane . although these @xmath23 and @xmath24 are also considered to be free parameters , models with limited ranges of these parameters can reproduce the ms and the mb ( e.g. , connors et al .",
    "the gas disk is assumed to have a _ negative _ metallicity gradient as the stellar components has ( e.g. , piatti et al .",
    "the gradient represented by @xmath28}_{\\rm g}(r)$ ] ( dex kpc@xmath29 ) is given as ; @xmath30}_{\\rm g}(r)= \\alpha \\times",
    "r + \\beta,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 ( in units of kpc ) is the distance from the center of the smc , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "these values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 are chosen such that ( i ) the metallicity of the _ central _ region of the smc can be consistent with the observed one ( @xmath28 } \\sim -0.6 $ ] ; v00 ) and ( ii ) the slope is well within the observed range of @xmath34 for very late - type , gas - rich galaxies ( zaritsky et al .",
    "if we adopt a stellar gradient ( i.e. , smaller @xmath34 ) in a model , gas particles stripped from the smc show a smaller mean metallicity .",
    "we investigate ( i ) the time ( @xmath36 ) when gas particles stripped from the smc pass through the lmc s central 7.5 kpc ( corresponding to the disk size with the scale length of 1.5 kpc , v00 ) and ( ii ) the metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) of the particles for models with different morphological types ( de or di ) , @xmath37 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 in the smc .",
    "such stripped smc s particles are referred to as `` accreted particles '' in the present study just for convenience .",
    "we also examine the mean metallicity and the mass fraction of the `` accreted particles '' ( @xmath28}_{\\rm acc}$ ] and @xmath38 , respectively ) in each of the six models for which values of model parameters are shown in the table 2 . the present simulations with no gas dynamics , no star formation , and a point - mass particle for",
    "the lmc can not precisely predict how much fraction of the `` accreted particles '' can be really accreted onto the lmc s gas disk and consequently used for star formation .",
    "we however believe that the present models enables us to grasp essential ingredients of gas transfer between the mcs for the last few gyrs .",
    "we mainly show the results for the `` standard model '' ( i.e. , model 1 ) which shows typical behaviors of gas stripping in the smc . in the followings ,",
    "the time @xmath39 is measured with respect to the present - time ( @xmath40 ) : for example , @xmath41 gyr means 1.5 gyr ago in the present study .",
    "fig.1 shows , for the standard model ( model 1 ) , the time evolution of the total gas mass ( stripped from the smc ) which reaches and is just located within the central 7.5 kpc of the lmc at each time step , @xmath42 .",
    "it is noted that @xmath42 is not an accumulated gas mass but is changeable with time as gas particles can pass through the lmc in the current collisionless simulation .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath42 evolution shows a number of peaks with the first peak about @xmath43 gyr ( @xmath44 ) , just after the first pericenter passage of the smc with respect to the galaxy in the 2.5 gyr evolution .",
    "the highest peak is seen at @xmath45 myr ( @xmath46 ) , when the lmc and the smc interact the most strongly .",
    "since the gas mass ( @xmath42 ) at its peak is not negligibly small compared with the present - day hi mass of the lmc ( @xmath47 ; v00 ) , accretion and infall of the gas onto the lmc s gas disk can increase local gas densities and consequently can possibly trigger star formation in the lmc .",
    "2 demonstrates the epoch of the `` magellanic squall '' , when the stripped gas particles of the smc are falling onto the disk of the lmc .",
    "3 shows the initial locations of the smc s gas particles ( with respect to the smc s center ) with @xmath48 myr @xmath49 and @xmath50 myr , where @xmath36 denotes the time when a particle passed through the central region of the lmc last time . the particles with @xmath51 myr are initially located in the outer part of the smc so that they can be stripped from the smc and consequently pass through the lmc earlier .",
    "owing to the small pericenter distance of the lmc - smc orbital evolution at @xmath45 myr , the smc is strongly disturbed to lose gas particles not only from its outer part but from its inner one . as a result of this , gas initially located throughout the gas disk of the smc",
    "can pass through the central region of the lmc at @xmath45 myr and thus show @xmath48 myr @xmath49 .",
    "the abovementioned differences in the initial spatial distributions between gas particles with @xmath48 myr @xmath49 and @xmath50 myr can cause the differences in metallicity distributions of the gas between the two populations , because the smc s gas disk is assumed to have a negative metallicity gradient .",
    "4 shows that the gas particles with @xmath50 myr have a larger fraction of metal - poor gas with @xmath52[fe / h]@xmath53 and a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath54 .",
    "the particles with @xmath55 gyr has a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath56 , because they are initially located in the outermost part of the smc s gas disk .",
    "4 also shows that the gas particles with @xmath48 myr @xmath49 have a peak around [ fe / h]@xmath57 with a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath58 .",
    "the particles with @xmath59 myr has a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath54 .",
    "these results clearly suggest that the lmc can replenish gas supplies through accretion and infall of _ metal - poor gas from the smc _ onto the lmc s disk .",
    "it should be stressed here that the metallicities of accreted gas from the smc at @xmath59 myr can be appreciably higher than the above , if we consider chemical evolution of the smc due to star formation for the last 2.5 gyr .",
    "5 shows that relative velocities ( @xmath60 ) of the smc s gas particles within the central 7.5 kpc of the lmc with respect to the lmc velocity range from 40 to 150 km s@xmath29 at @xmath45 myr .",
    "this result indicates that if the particles can infall onto the lmc s disk , they can give strong dynamical impact on the hi gas of the lmc and possibly cause shock energy dissipation owing to @xmath60 much higher than the sound velocities of cold gas .",
    "previous numerical simulations showed that cloud - cloud collisions with moderately high relative velocities ( @xmath61 km s@xmath29 ) can trigger the formation of scs ( bekki et al .",
    "therefore the above result implies that some fraction of the particles passing through the lmc s central region can be responsible for the formation of new scs in the lmc .",
    "the parameter dependences of @xmath28}_{\\rm acc}$ ] and @xmath38 are briefly summarized as follows .",
    "firstly @xmath28}_{\\rm acc}$ ] and @xmath38 do not depend so strongly on baryonic fractions , gas mass fractions , and orbital configurations ( see the table 2 ) : @xmath28}_{\\rm acc}$ ] ( @xmath38 ) ranges from @xmath62 ( 0.34 ) to @xmath63 ( 0.47 ) for a fixed size ratio of @xmath18 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "secondly , @xmath28}_{\\rm acc}$ ] and @xmath38 are _ both larger _ in the model with smaller @xmath18 ( model 6 ) for which a smaller amount of gas particles can be tidally stripped from the smc .",
    "the reason for the larger @xmath38 is that a significantly larger fraction of particles once stripped from the smc can pass through the lmc in model 6 .",
    "thirdly , the morphological type of the smc in the present study is not important for @xmath28}_{\\rm acc}$ ] and @xmath38 .",
    "given the fact that only 0.2% of gas can be converted into strongly bound scs ( rather than into field stars ) in the evolution of the mcs ( b05 ) , these results imply that the maximum possible mass of scs formed from smc s gas in the lmc is roughly @xmath65 in the present models . owing to the very short time scale ( @xmath66 yr ) of sc formation from gas clouds during the tidal interaction ( bekki et al .",
    "2004b ) , the stripped smc s gas clouds are highly likely to be accreted onto the lmc within the dynamical time scale of the lmc ( @xmath67 yr ) and then converted into scs within @xmath66 yr after the accretion .",
    "ngc 1718 with an estimated age of @xmath2 gyr has a low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath68 ) about 0.3 dex smaller than those of other scs with similar ages in the lmc ( e.g. , g03 ; g06 ) .",
    "if the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the lmc about @xmath69 gyr ago was very inhomogeneous in terms of chemical abundances , some fraction of stars could be born from quite low - metallicity gas clouds with [ fe / h]@xmath68 .",
    "the distinctively low metallicity therefore could be due to the abundance inhomogeneity of the ism in the lmc about @xmath69 gyr ago . however , intermediate - age scs _ other than _ ngc 1718 have very similar metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath70 and a small metallicity dispersion of only 0.09 dex in the lmc ( g06 ) .",
    "the observed low - metallicity of ngc 1718 thus seems to be unlikely to be due to the abundance inhomogeneity of the ism .",
    "we suggest that the origin of the ngc 1718 can be closely associated with the magellanic squall about @xmath69 gyr ago . since gaseous abundance patterns ( e.g. , [ mg / fe ] ) of the smc about a few gyr ago",
    "might well be very different from those of the lmc , ngc 1718 could have abundance patterns quite different from those of other gcs",
    ". it should be here stressed that the simulated peak of the squall ( @xmath71 gyr ) is not very consistent with the observed age of ngc 1718 ( @xmath72 gyr , g03 ) .",
    "s04 recently have reported that eight young scs with ages less than 200 myr have metallicities smaller than [ fe / h]@xmath73 that is a typical stellar metallicity of the lmc ( e.g. , v00 ) .",
    "although there could be some observational uncertainties in age and metallicity determination based solely on integrated spectrophotometric properties of scs ( s04 ) , their results imply that these scs could have been formed from metal - poor gas in the lmc quite recently .",
    "the present numerical results imply that ngc 1711 , ngc 1831 , ngc 1866 , and ngc 1984 , all of which are observed to have possible metallicities smaller than [ fe / h]@xmath74 , can be formed as a result of the magellanic squall . since the chemical abundances of the outer gas disk of the smc can be significantly different from those of the present lmc s gas disk , the detailed abundances ( e.g. , [ c / fe ] ,",
    "[ n / fe ] , and [ mg / fe ] ) of the above four clusters can be significantly different from those of other young scs with `` normal '' metallicities with [ fe / h]@xmath75 in the lmc .",
    "the observed young , metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath76 ) in the inter - cloud region close to the lmc ( r99 ) will be equally explained by the gas - transfer between the mcs ( see also bekki & chiba 2007 ) .",
    "the present study has first pointed out that the magellanic squall can also play a role in the relatively recent star formation history of the lmc .",
    "sporadic infall of metal - poor gas like the magellanic squall might well be also important for recent star formation histories in pairs of interacting galaxies .",
    "previous hydrodynamical simulations showed that high - velocity collisions of hi gas onto a galactic disk can create hi holes and shells ( e.g. , tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "the magellanic squall , which inevitably can cause high - velocity impact of the gas clouds stripped from the smc on the lmc , can thus be responsible for _ some _ of the observed hi holes in the lmc ( e.g. , staveley - smith et al .",
    "we plan to investigate how collisions between low - metallicity gas clouds from the smc and those initially in the lmc trigger the formation of stars and scs in the lmc s disk based on more sophisticated , high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations with pc - scale star formation processes .",
    "our future studies thus will enable us to understand more deeply how the magellanic squall influences pc - scale star formation processes in the lmc .",
