    "@xcite have reported an unusual coexistence of large thermopower and degenerate doping in the nanostructured material ag@xmath36snsb@xmath37te@xmath38 ( @xmath19=0.15 ) .",
    "this system shows a positive thermopower of @xmath30160 @xmath12v / k at 600 k and an almost metallic carrier concentration of @xmath305@xmath4510@xmath74 @xmath75 . in order to fully understand the role ag and sb play in these and other snte - based systems , especially those at low impurity concentration ( lightly doped ) limit ( @xmath303% ) ,",

    "is set to the highest occupied states or in the band gap.,width=336 ]    it is well known that the electronic structure of snte is anomalous compared to that of pbte .",
    "@xcite the main differences between these two systems are : ( i ) snte has a direct gap which is slightly away from the @xmath76 point ( along @xmath76-@xmath77 ) of the fcc bz if soi is included , but is a zero - gap semiconductor if soi is excluded ; whereas pbte has a direct gap at the @xmath76 point even in the absence of soi .",
    "( ii ) the symmetry of the band - edge states at and near the @xmath76 point changes in going from pbte to snte , resulting in the so - called `` band inversion '' phenomenon in snte .",
    "@xcite figure  [ fig;bandssnte](a ) shows the band structure of undoped snte along high symmetry directions of the sc bz , obtained in calculations using the ( 2@xmath452@xmath452 ) supercell . in the sc",
    "bz , the band gap of snte occurs near the @xmath73 point .",
    "the @xmath73 point is actually a saddle point , although the feature is not so evident from fig .",
    "[ fig;bandssnte](a ) where the band structure is plotted only along @xmath73-@xmath44 and @xmath73-@xmath78 .",
    "the calculated band gap at @xmath73 is @xmath300 ev ( without soi ) and 0.105 ev ( with soi ) .",
    "experimentally , snte was reported to have a band gap of 0.3 ev at 0 k.  @xcite    the band structure of snte doped with ag is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;bandssnte](b ) . the impurity - induced band associated with ag [ the dashed - dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig;bandssnte](b ) ] is predominantly ag @xmath79 and te @xmath0 states , splitting off from the valence - band top . the impurity - induced band associated with sb [ the dash - dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig;bandssnte](c ) ] , on the other hand , splits off from the conduction - band bottom and is predominantly sb @xmath0 and sn @xmath0 with some contribution from the hybridized @xmath0 states of the n.n .  te atoms of sb .",
    "this hybridized impurity - induced band comes down and closes the gap .",
    "these observations are similar to those in pbte and gete containing ag and sb .",
    "there are , however , noticeable differences near the conduction - band bottom .",
    "the saddle - point feature of @xmath73 is more pronounced ( compared to undoped snte ) along the @xmath73-@xmath44 and @xmath73-@xmath78 directions . the separation between the maximum at @xmath73 and the vbm is @xmath303 mev for snte doped with ag .    the electronic structure in the case of simultaneous doping is also different from what has been observed in pbte and gete .",
    "the introduction of ag does lift the sb- and bi - induced bands up in energy , but not the part near the @xmath73 point ; see figs .",
    "[ fig;bandssnte](e)@xmath31[fig;bandssnte](h ) .",
    "it , actually , seems to pull the impurity - induced bands near the @xmath73 point further down in energy resulting in a larger overlap with the valence band .",
    "based on the calculated band structures , one expects to see the ( ag , sb)-doped snte systems to exhibit highly degenerate semiconducting or even metallic conduction",
    ". however , large thermopower for the @xmath0-type snte - based systems is also possible because of the high degeneracy of the bands near the vbm .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of large thermopower and high carrier concentration in experiment .",
    "@xcite we note that the overlap between the impurity - induced bands and the valence band in these snte - based systems can be smaller or the systems may actually have small but finite gaps if one makes corrections to dft - gga calculations .",
    "in summary , the energetics of impurity clustering and the impurity - induced bands associated with various monovalent ( na , k , and ag ) and trivalent ( sb and bi ) impurities in pbte , snte , and gete were studied using first - principles calculations and supercell models .",
    "our results showed that the impurity pairs formed out of monovalent and trivalent atoms in pbte , snte , and gete have the lowest energy when they are the second nearest neighbors of one another .",
    "the te atoms near an impurity pair ( and some impurity atoms themselves ) tend to go `` off - center , '' mainly because of the strong and directional interaction between the @xmath0 states of the trivalent impurity cations ( sb and bi ) and the divalent anion ( te ) .",
    "one should carry out experimental studies to see if there is indeed off - centering in the real samples and how it impacts the transport properties of these systems .",
    "the electronic structures of pbte , snte , and gete are strongly perturbed by the impurities ( in the concentration range @xmath641% ) and the degree of perturbation depends on the relative separation between the impurities .",
    "band degeneracy at the vbm and cbm of the host materials is removed and there are band splittings in the presence of an impurity .",
    "we found that the impurity - induced bands associated with the monovalent impurities ( na , k , and ag ) split off from the valence - band top but overlap with the other valence bands near the vbm .",
    "all these bands , however , constitute the valence band and the systems are hole - doped .",
    "the impurity - induced bands associated with the trivalent impurities ( sb and bi ) , on the other hand , split off from the conduction - band bottom with large shifts towards the valence band .",
    "these bands reduce or even close the band gap .",
    "this is due to the strong interaction between the @xmath0 states of the trivalent impurity cation ( sb and bi ) and the divalent anion ( te ) which tends to introduce electronic states in the band gap region and drive the systems towards metallicity .",
    "the simultaneous doping of monovalent and trivalent impurities , however , pushes the impurity - induced band associated with the trivalent impurity to higher energies and the band gap increases or opens up , except for the snte - based systems .",
    "one , therefore , can tune the monovalent / trivalent ratio to tune the band gap and the band structure near the band edges in pbte and gete - based systems .",
    "snte behaves rather anomalously in the sense that the introduction of the monovalent impurity does not lift the trivalent impurity - induced band near the cbm up in energy but slightly pulls it further down towards the valence band .",
    "based on the calculated band structures , we have been able to explain qualitatively the observed transport properties of the whole class of pbte- , snte- , and gete - based bulk thermoelectrics .    in spite of the known limitations of dft - gga and supercell methods ,",
    "@xcite our first - principles studies thus provide a clear physical picture of how different impurities affect the lattice geometry and electronic structure of the host materials .",
    "these results provide a qualitative understanding of the atomic and transport properties of complex multicomponent pbte- , snte- , and gete - based thermoelectrics .",
    "the approach described here however is not limited to these systems but can be extended to other classes of materials . the `` band - gap problem '' can , in principle , be addressed by using more advanced methods which go beyond dft - gga .  @xcite these calculations for our systems are currently too demanding computationally ; however , they are very desirable since having accurate electronic structures of the materials is an important step towards a quantitative understanding of their transport properties .",
