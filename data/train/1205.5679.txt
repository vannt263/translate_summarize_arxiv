    "in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) certain gauge field configurations will induce chirality as follows from the axial ward identity @xcite .",
    "these gauge field configurations have a net topological charge density , which means that the contraction of the field strength tensor with its dual is nonvanishing .",
    "an example of such gauge field configuration is one in which the ( chromo)electric and ( chromo)magnetic fields are parallel . for massless particles , chirality is the asymmetry between the number of particles plus antiparticles with right - handed helicity and the number of particles plus antiparticles with left - handed helicity . here",
    "right - handed helicity means that spin and momentum are parallel , whereas left - handed helicity means they are anti - parallel . if a system of charged fermions possesses a net chirality , then an applied ( electromagnetic ) magnetic field will induce an electromagnetic current in the direction of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this is called the chiral magnetic effect . in magnetic fields that are large enough to fully polarize the fermions",
    ", one can easily convince oneself that the magnitude of this current is equal to the chirality times the absolute charge of the fermion @xcite .    to improve the understanding of the chiral magnetic effect it is important to obtain the magnitude of the induced electromagnetic current in different situations . in many studies of the chiral magnetic effect the chirality",
    "is introduced by hand through a chiral chemical potential @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , in order to get a full understanding of the chiral magnetic effect , one should include the dynamics that leads to a net chirality .",
    "such dynamical studies have been performed in euclidean space - time using lattice qcd @xcite and with analytic methods , both in euclidean @xcite and minkowski @xcite space - time .",
    "-direction ( @xmath1 ) is homogeneous and can have arbitrary time dependence .",
    "the magnetic field along the @xmath2-direction is static and homogeneous .",
    "the goal is to compute the current density @xmath3 along the magnetic field in the @xmath4-direction ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "[ fig : fields ] ]    in this article we will study the real - time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect with an analytic method . we will consider a specific gauge field configuration of parallel homogeneous ( chromo)electric and ( chromo)magnetic fields that are pointing in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "these parallel fields are the source of the chirality .",
    "the ( chromo)magnetic field is assumed to be constant in time , but the ( chromo)electric field can have any time dependence .",
    "perpendicular to these fields we will consider an electromagnetic magnetic field with arbitrary time dependence that points in the @xmath4-direction .",
    "we have sketched the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] .",
    "the goal of this article is to obtain the current density in the @xmath4-direction , which is due to the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "the chiral magnetic effect will take place unsuppressed if the fields have a magnitude that is at least of order of the fermion mass squared . in the near future , one hopes to create such enormous electromagnetic fields with high intensity lasers ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . if one could engineer a field configuration like the one of fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] with these lasers , one could falsify the chiral magnetic effect in qed in a controlled environment . in heavy ion collisions a similar configuration built out of flux - tubes of parallel chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields",
    "is induced @xcite .",
    "perpendicular to these color fields a large electromagnetic magnetic field is generated through the currents created by the colliding charged ions @xcite .    in qcd the probability of generating gauge field configurations with positive and negative topological charge",
    "is equal ( assuming @xmath6 ) .",
    "hence in heavy ion collisions , the current along the perpendicular field vanishes on average .",
    "however , because of fluctuations in the initial state @xcite , and the presence of sphalerons @xcite the topological charge fluctuates . hence the current along the perpendicular magnetic field will fluctuate as well .",
    "that will lead to differences in net electric charge between the two sides of the reaction plane ( the plane in which the beam - axis and the impact parameter lie ) on an event - by - event basis @xcite . this effect can be analyzed experimentally through a charge correlation study @xcite .",
    "charge correlations have indeed been observed at both the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "however , currently it is not clear if these correlations are caused by the chiral magnetic effect or by another mechanism @xcite .",
    "a possible observation of the chiral magnetic effect in qcd can teach us about the relevance of configurations with topological charge .    theoretically , the field configuration displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] is interesting , because when all fields are static and homogeneous it is possible to obtain a full analytic expression for the induced current density along the perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the current density behaves exactly according to the qualitative expectations of the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "for example , for a large perpendicular magnetic field the magnitude of the current was found to be equal to the chirality times the absolute value of the charge of the fermion .",
    "furthermore , the current density is suppressed by the fermion mass , and vanishes if there is no chirality production .",
    "the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite was build upon a nice argument based on lorentz transformations and the particle production rate in parallel , homogeneous and static fields .",
    "however , this argument can not be applied to more general situations that are useful to investigate .",
    "for example , in heavy ion collisions the magnetic field has a strong time dependence . furthermore , with high - intensity lasers",
    "one will create inhomogeneous and time - dependent fields . and for purely academic reasons it is of interest to analyze the real - time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect in a spherical symmetric background gluon field that carries one unit of topological charge , and is a solution of the yang - mills equations .    to obtain the induced current density along the magnetic field in a general situation",
    "one can in principle just solve the dirac equation numerically , and construct the current from the solutions .",
    "however , this might be quite difficult in practice . in order to make progress",
    ", we will start a program to investigate the chiral magnetic effect using linear response theory .",
    "we will expand to first order in the electromagnetic field that is the source of the perpendicular magnetic field . in this way we can investigate the chiral magnetic effect for weak perpendicular magnetic fields that have arbitrary space and time dependence . in practical terms we will confirm in this article the results of ref .",

    "the electromagnetic current has also a component in the @xmath2-direction due to acceleration of charges along the electric field . in the qcd setup however , this contribution to the electromagnetic current vanishes due to a cancellation from the contribution of red and green quarks .",
