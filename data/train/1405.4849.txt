    "one of the frontiers of condensed matter physics is the study of competing quantum phases such as coexistent and inhomogeneous phases , quantum criticality , and secondary ordered phases close to quantum critical points .",
    "@xcite these exotic phenomena in strongly correlated systems occur due to the competition and cooperation between the spin , charge , lattice , and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , it is often difficult to differentiate the effect of these degrees of freedom in real materials .",
    "however , the advance of optical lattice experiments provides a tantalizing opportunity to study competing phases via controlled external parameters .  @xcite    the experimental tunability of hamiltonian parameters using laser and magnetic fields  @xcite allows the realization of strongly correlated model hamiltonians .",
    "the realization of the bose - hubbard model using ultra - cold atoms on optical lattices  @xcite has led to the observation  @xcite of the mott - insulator to superfluid phase transition .",
    "the mott insulator phase is characterized by commensurate occupations , gapped excitations and incompressibility in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the superfluid phase is characterized by bose - einstein condensation , gapless excitations and finite compressibility in the weak coupling regime .",
    "this success has spurred interest in mixtures of atoms which can give rise to even more interesting and complex phases .",
    "these include mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atoms  @xcite ( a bose - fermi mixture ) and mixtures of two different bosonic species ( a bose - bose mixture ) .",
    "@xcite moreover , experimental studies of @xmath0-@xmath1 , @xmath1-@xmath2 , @xmath3-@xmath4 and different alkaline earth mixtures in optical lattices  @xcite have motivated theoretical studies of the two species bose - hubbard model .",
    "@xcite the zero - temperature phase diagram of the two - dimensional , two - species , hard - core bosonic hubbard model has been studied at half - filling using a combination of mean field and variational methods ,  @xcite and by means of quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "@xcite the rich phase diagram found at half - filling in these studies shows ordered mott insulating phases including anti - ferromagnetic and super - counter - fluid phases in the strong interaction limit . on the other hand , superfluid and antiferromagnetic / superfluid phases",
    "are found in the weak interaction limit .",
    "@xcite recently , we have included doping dependence as a control parameter to study this model using quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "we found several distinct phases including a normal liquid at higher temperatures , an antiferromagnetically ordered mott insulator , and a region of coexistent antiferromagnetic and superfluid order near half - filling .",
    "@xcite we also reported a small dome containing a phase - separated ferromagnetic phase away from half - filling at zero polarization .",
    "though the realization of quantum magnetic phases has gained significant attention , the prominent experimental challenge is to reach the low temperatures and entropies needed to observe these phases .",
    "several different experimental techniques have been proposed to reach such low entropies .",
    "@xcite interestingly , a bose - fermi mixture may be used to squeeze the entropy of a fermi gas into the surrounding bose gas .",
    "@xcite this can leave a low entropy heavy fermi gas by evaporating the entropy absorbed by the light bose gas .",
    "the relatively high global entropy of the phase - separated ferromagnetic phase we found away from half - filling in the two species hubbard model  @xcite suggests that this ferromagnet should be easier to access experimentally .    in the experimental setup of boson - boson mixtures ,",
    "the two species are not always perfectly balanced .",
    "@xcite the evaporative cooling leads to net losses of one of the species , due to the difference in the effective depth of the traps .",
    "this can be adjusted by loading different number of atoms for different species into the trap .",
    "@xcite this procedure can also be used to set an imbalance amount of atoms for the two species .",
    "most of the previous theoretical or numerical studies on the two - species bose - hubbard model do not directly address this imbalance in the experimental conditions .    in this paper , we explore the extent of the phase - separated ferromagnetic phase as a function of _ finite _ polarization , i.e. , with a different population for each species . when the polarization is positive ( more of the light than heavy particles )",
    "we find a larger region of the ferromagnetic phase - separated order , with higher transition temperatures and greater extent in doping . since this ferromagnetic phase exists for a broad range of sufficiently high temperatures and polarizations together with high global entropies , experimental observation in cold atoms may be achievable .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] we describe our model and method .",
    "the density versus polarization phase diagram at low temperature is studied in section [ sec : dpphasediagram ] . in section [ sec : ptphasediagram ] we discuss the temperature versus polarization phase diagram along an optimal superfluid or maximum ferromagnetic phase line . the momentum distribution of the ferromagnetic and superfluid phases are presented in section [ sec : momentum ] . in section [ sec : entropy ] we calculate the entropy of the ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic and superfluid phases .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "<S> introducing polarization , an imbalance in the population between species , we find a fully phase - separated ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> this phase exists for a broad range of temperatures and polarizations . by using finite size scaling of the susceptibility </S>",
    "<S> , we find a critical exponent which is consistent with the two - dimensional ising universality class . </S>",
    "<S> significantly , since the global entropy of this phase is higher than that of the ferromagnetic phase with single species , its experimental observation in cold atoms may be feasible . </S>"
