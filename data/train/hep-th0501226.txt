    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions , large amount of pions can be created in small space - time regions . theoretically , it is possible for these pions to condensate into the zero momentum and form bose - einstein condensation(bec ) at certain temperatures and densities . for this problem ,",
    "there are some discussions in the literature , for example , the bec of pions in the non - equilibrium process  @xcite , the pion condensation in thermal equilibrium incorporating boundary effects  @xcite , and the search for the  cold spots \" in multipion system  @xcite , etc .",
    "these studies show a great interest on this issue . on the other hand , in high energy physics",
    ", the chiral symmetry which is spontaneously broken at low temperature is expected to be restored at high temperature and/or density  @xcite .",
    "long before , kapusta and haber had discussed the relation between bec and the spontaneous symmetry breaking by using different scalar models  @xcite .",
    "their main interest , however , was focused on the physics of the electroweak system . here in the strong interacting pion system",
    ", one may wonder whether there are some relations between the chiral symmetry restoration and bec .",
    "our motivation in this paper is to discuss the relation between these two phenomena in the pion system and find the phase diagram of them through a model study . as far as we know",
    ", this topic has not been much discussed in the literature . in  @xcite",
    ", the chiral symmetry restoration is discussed in the interaction pion gas through virial expansion , where bec is only discussed in the case of free pion gas . here",
    "we will discuss bec and the chiral phase transition in the interacting pion system with the linear sigma model .",
    "the linear sigma model has been extensively used to discuss the chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature  @xcite . in our discussion , to address bec and the chiral phase transition simultaneously , we will consider a finite pion density as well as the temperature .",
    "the pion chemical potential can be introduced in different ways . theoretically , at given conditions",
    "when the pion number can be regarded as being fixed  @xcite , one could introduce the pion number density .",
    "however , generally speaking , pion number is not a conserved quantity and one should find a certain conserved charge of the system . for the linear sigma model which has the isospin invariance",
    ", one can introduce a chemical potential associated with the isospin charge .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , the pion isospin chemical potential is introduced by the third component of the isospin charge and applied to the discussions of the thermal pion mass within the chiral perturbation theory . in our discussion , the isospin chemical potential of pions is introduced to the linear sigma model in the same way .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section 2 the effective potential for the linear sigma model",
    "is calculated within the cornwall , jackiw , tomboulis resummation scheme at finite temperature and finite pion density in the hartree approximation .",
    "the gap equations are derived by the stationary condition , which form the basis of our numerical calculation . in section 3 ,",
    "the bec and the chiral phase transition are studied by a numerical calculation .",
    "we discuss their @xmath0 phase diagrams and give the physical analysis .",
    "the last section comprises a summary of our results .",
    "in studies of phase transitions the effective potential is an important and popular theoretical tool .",
    "it is defined through an effective action which is the generating functional of the one particle irreducible graphs .",
    "a generalized version is the effective potential for composite operators introduced by cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis(cjt )  @xcite .",
    "this formalism assumes that the effective potential @xmath1 depends not only on @xmath2 , a possible expectation value of the quantum field @xmath3 , but also on @xmath4 , a possible expectation value of the time - ordered product @xmath5 .",
    "physical solutions demand minimization of the effective potential with respect to both @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which means = 0 ,  = 0 .",
    "this formalism was originally written at zero temperature .",
    "then it has been extended to finite temperature occasion by amelino - camelia and pi for investigations of the effective potential of the @xmath8 theory  @xcite .",
    "it has been also used in the linear sigma model for discussing the chiral phase transition at finite temperature  @xcite . at finite density as well as finite temperature",
    ", we will employ this formalism to discuss both bec and the chiral phase transition with the linear sigma model .    for the linear sigma model",
    ", here we will ignore the fermion sector .",
    "the lagrangian can be written as = 12(*)^2&+&12()^2 - 12m^2 ^ 2 - 12m^2 ^ 2 + & -&24(^2+^2)^2- , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the sigma field and the three pion fields ( @xmath11 ) respectively .",
    "the explicit chiral symmetry breaking term is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the pion decay constant .",

    ", we only consider the case in the chiral limit @xmath18 , then at zero temperature the pion mass is @xmath19 and the sigma mass is taken as @xmath20 . *",
    "the conventional treatment of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of the linear sigma model is to shift the sigma field as @xmath21 , where @xmath6 is expectation value of the sigma field and the order parameter of the chiral phase transition .",
    "then the lagrangian results as = 12()^2&+&12()^2 - 12(m^2+2 ^ 2)^2 -12(m^2+6 ^ 2)^2 + & -&12m^2 ^ 2 -24 ^ 4 -24(^2+^2)^2-6 ^ 3-6 ^ 2 . in the following discussion",
    ", we will adopt hartree approximation which means only the bubble diagrams with four - point vertex need to be calculated .",
    "so the last two terms in the lagrangian are neglected  @xcite .",
    "the chemical potential is introduced through the third component of isospin charge .",
    "the lagrangian ( 3 ) is invariant under the isospin transformation , therefore according to noether s theorem the conserved current is @xmath22 and the conserved isospin charge is @xmath23 then the partition function of the system can be written as z = exp , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the conjugate momenta of @xmath26 and @xmath9 .",

    "-12(_1+i_2 ) ,  _ + 12(_1-i_2 ) ,  _ 0_3 . integrating out the conjugate momenta in equation ( 4 ) and using the redefined pion fields , one obtains z = exp , where @xmath30 is the effective lagrangian of the system and can be written as , & l&_eff=|_i|^2-(m^2+6 ^ 2)||^2 + 12(_0)^2 + 12()^2 + & -&12(m^2+6 ^ 2)^2_0 - 12(m^2+2 ^ 2)^2 - 12m^2 ^ 2-24 ^ 4 + & -&24 ^ 4 + 4||^4+_0 ^ 4 + 4 ^ 2||^2 + 2 ^",

    ". for boson there are @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for the sake of simplicity in what follows ,",
    "a shorthand notation is used to denote the integration and the summation .    according to the lagrangian ( 8) ,",

    "is symmetric over @xmath43 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are equivalent in describing the propagators of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "here we just choose @xmath46 to describe both @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and write the two propagators in the same form as in equation ( 12 ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "we can write down the corresponding effective potential at finite temperature as v ( & & , g)=12m^2 ^ 2+24 ^ 4 + 12_g^-1_+12_+12_g^-1_0 + & + & 12_+_g^-1 + _ + v_2 ( , g ) , where @xmath48 and @xmath7 are the full propagators of @xmath49 and @xmath40 respectively .",

    "recent investigation about the renormalization of the o(n ) linear sigma model has been addressed in @xcite . in our discussion , the divergent parts of the integrals are neglected as is done in @xcite . and",
    "we take the finite parts of the integrals as follows : & & _ g^-1= _ + & = & 1 , + & & _ g=_1(_n+i)^2+*k*^2+m^2",

    "the transition is found to be first order in the chiral limit .",
    "if we take @xmath81 , we can reproduce their result . in the case of @xmath82 , we find the chiral phase transition is still first order . this can be seen if we take a look at @xmath60 as a function of @xmath6 . as the gap equations ( 21)(23 ) can be solved at certain @xmath67 and @xmath28 , from equation ( 28 ) , the thermodynamical potential @xmath60 can be determined .",

    "when @xmath93 , the transition temperature will decrease with the chemical potential increasing . at certain temperature ( @xmath94 ) , the phase curve of the chiral phase transition will terminate , because at this time @xmath64 and bec will happen . as a result the chiral phase transition can not take place further at lower temperatures .",
