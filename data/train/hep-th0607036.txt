    "it is well known that different types of topological objects may have been formed in the early universe after planck time by the vacuum phase transition @xcite . depending on the topology of the vacuum manifold these are domain walls , strings , monopoles and textures . among them , cosmic strings and monopoles seem to be the best candidate to be observed .",
    "a global monopole is a spherical heavy object formed in the phase transition of a system composed by a self - coupling goldstone field , whose original global symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the matter fields play the role of an order parameter which outside the monopole s core acquires a non - vanishing value . the global monopole was first introduced by sokolov and starobinsky @xcite .",
    "a few years later , the gravitational effects of of the global monopole were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a solution is presented which describes a global monopole at large radial distances .",
    "the gravitational effects produced by this object may be approximated by a solid angle deficit in the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the nontrivial properties of the vacuum are among the most important predictions of quantum field theory .",
    "these properties are manifested in the response of the vacuum to the external electromagnetic and gravitational fields . in particular , the explicit calculations of the vacuum polarization caused by particular external fields have played an important role in the development of quantum field theory .",
    "the quantum effects due to the point - like global monopole spacetime on the matter fields have been considered for massless scalar @xcite and fermionic @xcite fields , respectively . in order to develop this analysis ,",
    "the scalar respectively spinor green functions in this background have been obtained .",
    "the influence of the non - zero temperature on these polarization effects has been considered in @xcite for scalar and fermionic fields . moreover ,",
    "the calculation of quantum effects on massless scalar field in a higher dimensional global monopole spacetime has also been developed in @xcite .",
    "the combined vacuum polarization effects by the non - trivial geometry of a global monopole and boundary conditions imposed on the matter fields are investigated as well . in this direction ,",
    "the total casimir energy associated with massive scalar field inside a spherical region in the global monopole background have been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite by using the zeta function regularization procedure .",
    "scalar casimir densities induced by spherical boundaries have been calculated in @xcite to higher dimensional global monopole spacetime by making use of the generalized abel - plana summation formula @xcite .",
    "more recently , using also this formalism , a similar analysis for spinor fields with mit bag boundary conditions has been developed in  @xcite .",
    "many of treatments of quantum fields around a global monopole deal mainly with the case of the idealized point - like monopole geometry .",
    "however , the realistic global monopole has a characteristic core radius determined by the symmetry braking scale at which the monopole is formed . a simplified model for the monopole core where the region inside the core is described by the de sitter geometry",

    "we will analyze the effects of global monopole core on properties of the quantum vacuum for the general spherically symmetric static model with a core of finite radius .",
    "the most important quantities characterizing these properties are the vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "though the corresponding operators are local , due to the global nature of the vacuum , the vacuum expectation values describe the global properties of the bulk and carry an important information about the structure of the defect core .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source of gravity in the einstein equations .",
    "it therefore plays an important role in modelling a self - consistent dynamics involving the gravitational field . as the first step for the investigation of vacuum densities we evaluate the positive frequency wightman function for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter .",
    "this function gives comprehensive insight into vacuum fluctuations and determines the response of a particle detector of the unruh - dewitt type moving in the global monopole bulk .",
    "the problem under consideration is also of separate interest as an example with gravitational and boundary - induced polarizations of the vacuum , where all calculations can be performed in a closed form .",
    "the corresponding results specify the conditions under which we can ignore the details of the interior structure and approximate the effect of the global monopole by the idealized model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secm:1 ]",
    "we consider the wightman function in the exterior of the global monopole for the general structure of the core assuming that the components of the metric tensor and their derivatives are continuous at the transition surface between the core and the exterior . by using this function , in section [ sec : phi2emt ] we investigate the vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the section [ sec : thinshell ] is devoted to the generalization of the corresponding results when an additional surface shell is present on the bounding surface between the core and the exterior .  as an illustration of the general results , in section [ sec : flowerpot ] we consider the flower - pot model with the minkowskian geometry inside the core",
    "for this model the vacuum expectation values inside the core are investigated as well . in section [ msec3:conc ]",
