    "intracellular transport by molecular motor proteins is essential for many cellular functions such as shuttling vesicles or organelles to their proper destinations @xcite . in eukaryotic cells , polar cytoskeletal filaments",
    "serve as tracks for three families of cytoskeletal motors : kinesins and dyneins that move along microtubules , and myosins that walk along actin filaments @xcite .",
    "the movements of a molecular motor along its filamentous track can be described as a biased random walk . however , after a certain number of steps the motor unbinds from the track because the thermal noise of the environment overcomes the finite motor  filament binding energy .",
    "the motor then diffuses in the surrounding fluid as a brownian particle until it comes close to the track to rebind to it . on large time scales",
    ", motors therefore perform peculiar motor walks that consist of alternating periods of directed motion or biased random walks on the tracks and undirected diffusive motion in the fluid environment @xcite .",
    "intracellular transport is typically achieved by several types of motors rather than just by one type @xcite .",
    "different types of motors may either move independently along the same filament or work together to power bi - directional transport of a cargo that carries two types of motors @xcite . here",
    "we consider the first case , where different species of motors move on the same filament , and interact only via their mutual exclusion .",
    "these motors species might move into different directions , or they might move into the same direction but have different velocities or different affinities to the filament .",
    "we are interested in the traffic behavior of the latter systems",
    ".    a simple model for motor traffic is based on the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite . in the asep ,",
    "particles that interact through mutual exclusion from lattice sites perform biased random walks along a one dimensional lattice .",
    "this paradigmatic model for non - equilibrium transport exhibits interesting phenomena such as boundary induced phase transitions and traffic jams @xcite . to describe the traffic of motor proteins , asep - like models have to be supplemented with the dynamics of binding to and unbinding from the track to account for the finite run length of the motors @xcite .",
    "aseps with a single species of particles can be generalized to models with multiple species @xcite . even without attachment and detachment of particles ,",
    "multi - species aseps exhibit a variety of cooperative phenomena , such as spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite and phase separation @xcite .",
    "to model cellular traffic with different types of motors , one has to consider multi - species aseps with attachment and detachment of particles .",
    "apart from investigations on conditions for the exact solvability @xcite , most work on multi - species aseps with detachment and attachment has focused on the traffic of two species of particles moving into opposite directions @xcite .",
    "these models exhibit continuous phase transitions @xcite , hysteresis of the total current @xcite , traffic jams @xcite , spontaneous symmetry breaking and localized shocks @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the case where two species of particles move in the same direction , but do so either with different velocities or with different binding affinities to the filament .",
    "a few such systems have been studied experimentally in vitro , in particular the traffic of mixtures of fast - moving and slow- or non - moving kinesin motors @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ theoretical model for multi - species motor traffic ] we will present the theoretical model for multi - species motor traffic .",
    "we will focus on the situation that two motor species differ in only one parameter . in section [ two species of motors with different unbinding probabilities ]",
    "we will discuss the traffic of two types of motors which differ only in their unbinding parameters . in section [ two species of motors with different stepping probabilities ] we will discuss the traffic of two species with different stepping parameters , specifically one species with zero velocity .",

    "such filaments are polymers which have periodic motor binding sites with repeat distance @xmath0 , and motors walk along the filament with steps of the same size @xmath0 . for microtubules ,",
    "the lattice constant is @xmath1  nm . we therefore represent the filament by a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath2 binding sites with spacing @xmath0 . per unit time @xmath3 ,",
    "a bound motor of type @xmath4 on the filament makes a forward step with probability @xmath5 if the target site is free , unbinds with probability @xmath6 and remains at the same site otherwise @xcite .",
    "unbound motors are treated as a motor reservoir @xcite with unbound density @xmath7 for the @xmath4-th type of motors .",
    "an unbound motor binds to the filament with the sticking probability @xmath8 when the binding site is empty .",
    "the treatment of unbound motors as a reservoir is slightly different from that in a previous lattice model for motor traffic in ref .",
    "@xcite where the diffusion of unbound motors has been treated explicitly as brownian movement . the simplification to treat the unbound motors as",
    "a reservoir is appropriate if the density of unbound motors is homogeneous , as is the case for sufficiently fast diffusion and large motor numbers in the bulk solution .",
    "this is typically the case in _ in vitro _",
    "experiments , where the buffer is an aqueous solution with motor concentrations in the nano- or micro - molar range .",
    "the typical length of a microtubule is of the order of @xmath9 or even larger , which is one order of magnitude larger than the typical motor run length , which is of the order of @xmath10 for kinesins .",
    "therefore , we use periodic boundary conditions throughout this paper .",
    "this simplification is appropriate as most motors do not feel the ends of the filament , so that effects of the filament ends can be neglected .. the latter scaling , which has been used in ref .",
