    "our second goal is to compute the gluino decay branching fractions in some interesting simplified models that can show the rich variety of possibilities that gluino decays could present to us at the lhc .",

    "we include in this section the complete formulae for gluino decays in the case where squarks are heavier than the gluino .",
    "the formulae are left in terms of the general couplings between quarks , squarks and `` -inos '' ( gluinos , neutralinos and charginos ) shown in figure  [ feynrul ] . since these are generic couplings , one can add flavor mixing among squarks ( unconstrained when the squarks are heavier than about @xmath2 gev ) , cp phases , or include extra neutralinos in the spectrum .",

    ", a four - point fermion interaction of quark - quark - gluino - higgsino can have its two quark lines tied together and a gluon can radiate from any strongly interacting particle .",
    "this diagram is divergent in the effective theory , which is cut off by the squark mass ( the scale of the effective theory breakdown ) .",
    "the analagous construction of the two body decay from the quark - quark - gluino - wino diagram in the effective theory has no divergence , and therefore no log of the squark mass .",
    "thinking of these decays within the effective theory description enables us to understand that the purely diagrammatic calculation presented in this paper ( and the simpler equivalent calculations in previous papers ) are not entirely adequate when the scalar masses are much heavier than the gaugino masses .",
    "the large logarithm can cause a breakdown in perturbation theory for the diagrammatic calculation . to do the calculation properly in that case would require matching the effective theory with the full theory at the heavy scalar mass scale and performing a renormalization group running of operator coefficients down to the gluino scale and then computing the decay in the effective theory .",
    "we have estimated that as long as @xmath58 ( for @xmath59 less than a few tev ) we do not have to worry about this effect , and that is one reason we are cutting off all our graphs at that scale .",
    "this does not cause us much concern in our analysis as it is our opinion that the most straightforward split supersymmetry scenarios have scalar masses only a loop level ( or so ) higher than the gaugino masses , which is well within the confines of our graphs .",
    "therefore , when the squark masses are sufficiently large , the logarithm can overcome any loop factor supression and the supression from the gluino mass squared in the denominator .",
    "of course the heavier the gluino , the larger the scalar masses need to be for the two - body decay to be sizeable .",
    "this situation is well represented in figure  [ br2bplots ] , where the 2-body loop - induced branching fraction of gluino decay becomes smaller as the gluino mass increases for fixed scalar mass @xmath46 .",
    "we take the two different low scale spectra defined earlier , msugra with @xmath60 gev and amsb with @xmath61 gev . in both cases",

    "note , the @xmath56 dominance occurs when the higgsino is kinematically allowed in gluino decays .",
    "if that is not the case , the lack of a @xmath56 enhancement of the two - body decays means the three - body decay will generally win out .",
    "therefore , the mass of the higgsino is of prime importance to gluino decay phenomenology .",
    "we proceed now to describe the behavior of different branching ratios of gluino decay when the scalar mass parameter @xmath46 is varied between the tev scale to @xmath64 gev . in all plots a gray vertical band",

    "we take @xmath71 to compare the enhancement effect .",
    "another feature of the spectrum taken for these plots is the value of @xmath70 gev such that the lightest neutralino is a mixed state of bino and higgsino .    in the figures we plot two types of lines , thick and thin .",
    "the thick dotted line gives the branching fraction of gluino decay into gluon plus ( any ) neutralino , the thick solid line represents the decay into @xmath75 plus ( any ) neutralino and the thick dash - dotted line gives the @xmath76-@xmath77 plus ( any ) chargino channel .",
    "the thin lines are really @xmath78 and concentrate on the lightest neutralino and chargino , so that the thin dotted line represents decay into gluon plus lightest neutralino ( @xmath79 ) , the thin solid represents @xmath80 plus lightest neutralino and the thin dash - dotted line represents @xmath77-@xmath76 plus lightest chargino .",
    "the two plots of figure  [ sugra120 ] show clearly that in the pev scale range the 2-body decay starts to dominate over chargino and neutralino 3-body decays .",
    "not surprisingly the decay into @xmath80 and @xmath81 is enhanced for small @xmath82 since the stop mediating that decay channel is clearly lighter than the rest of squarks .",
    "the @xmath80 plus neutralino branching ranges from @xmath83 to @xmath84 in the prompt decay zone of the gluino , and can thus be an interesting signal , since between 15% and 5% of the time a pair of gluinos will give rise to at least 4 top events .",
    "as for the exclusive signals we see that the @xmath80 plus @xmath79 branching ranges between @xmath85 and @xmath86 and monotonically decreases with @xmath46 due to the fact that the 2-body branching is increasing .",
    "the other interesting signal is the 2-body decay into gluon and @xmath79 , the branching of which increases to values of around @xmath87 for the larger scalar masses .",
    "this mode has some importance in this case because the lightest neutralino carries some higgsino component and therefore its radiative gluino decay increases thanks to the @xmath56 enhacement discussed in the previous section .",
