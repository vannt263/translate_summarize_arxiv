    "this section treats the selection of sources from the fsc and the fscr in turn .    to minimize the effects of cirrus and contamination from stars , we chose a sky coverage limit of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the same excluded areas used by strauss et al .",
    "( 1990 ) were excluded from our sky coverage region . at high galactic latitudes ,",
    "the excluded regions consist almost wholly of gaps not covered by iras , and the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "our sample covers 47.7% of the sky .",
    "the 90% completeness limit for the fsc lies at a 25 @xmath0 m flux density of 210 mjy for sky covered by 2 hcons , and at 170 mjy for coverage of 3 hcons , for @xmath3 ( moshir et al .",
    "our preliminary searches of redshift databases indicated , however , that for such faint flux density limits , many of the faintest objects would have no redshift available .",
    "a flux density limit of 250 mjy was found to have a small redshift incompleteness ( see below ) and was selected for our sample .",

    "we found only a few of these sources to be possible galaxies which , along with the reject sources that match with galaxies within the @xmath9 error ellipses , gives a small sample of 27 sources . among these , there are 5 sources which are extremely blue , and have null snrs at 60 @xmath0 m .",
    "addscans ( one - dimensional coadds of iras scans ) of these sources show no obvious detections at their locations at all four iras bands .",

    ", a sample of 851 sources randomly distributed in our sampling regions was generated .",
    "the number of matches with galaxies is only 2 .",
    "this indicates that these 22 reject sources are not likely to be just random matches with galaxies .",
    "furthermore , it shows that the number of coincidental matches in our total sample should also be very small .",
    "the breakdown of sources for redshifts for our entire sample ( fsc plus fscr sources ) is listed in table [ tab : redsrc ] .",
    "the previously unpublished redshifts obtained at flwo are tabulated in table [ tab : redshifts ] .",

    "there are 17 galaxies remaining without redshifts .",
    "the 1.2 jy survey catalog also provides the addscan flux densities for the sources extended at 60 @xmath0 m . for those sources which have no addscan flux densities in the 1.2 jy survey but",
    "are extended at 25 @xmath0 m , we have obtained new addscan flux density measurements and substituted these for the fsc values .",
    "figure [ fig : ncounts ] shows the @xmath10 versus @xmath11 plot for the sample of galaxies with redshifts .",
    "the points follow a slope of -1.5 all the way to our flux limit , demonstrating the high completeness of our sample as a function of flux .",
    "the apparent excess at high flux values is most likely due to the local supercluster .",
    "further checks of completeness are presented in section [ sec : compdisc ] , including an investigation of possible systematic effects of flux errors on derived luminosity functions .    for each galaxy ,",
    "secondary distances are used when available .",
    "otherwise , distances have been assigned using a linear virgocentric inflow model ( aaronson et al .",
    "1982 ) and a hubble constant of 75 km  s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 ( see appendix [ sec : h0disc ] for the case of a different hubble constant ) .",

    "( 1987 ) have been used to identify virgo cluster galaxies ( with a distance of 17.6 mpc ) .",
    "the monochromatic luminosity of each source is computed from the distance , using a @xmath13-correction that assumes a power - law slope of the sed between 12 @xmath0 m and 25 @xmath0 m .",
    "the monochromatic luminosities are expressed as @xmath14 and have units of solar luminosities .",
    "the classic method of estimating luminosity functions is via the @xmath1 estimator ( schmidt 1968 ) .",
    "this technique is non - parametric , so no analytic form of the luminosity function need be assumed , but the data must be binned .",
    "the infrared luminosity functions presented by soifer et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and soifer & neugebauer ( 1991 ) were derived via this method .",
    "the space density @xmath16 and its error @xmath17 are computed from the following quantities : @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the solid angle of the survey , @xmath15 is the maximum volume to which the object could have been detected , and the sum is over all galaxies in each luminosity bin . the assumption that galaxies are distributed uniformly in space may be tested by checking that @xmath21 is 0.5 in each luminosity bin .",
    "the luminosity function may also be derived via maximum likelihood techniques that are independent of density variations ( e.g. sandage , tammann , & yahil 1979 ) . the parametric method has the advantage that no binning of the data is required , but an analytic form of the luminosity function must be assumed",
    ". for all of the parametric maximum likelihood fits in this paper , we have assumed a cumulative luminosity function of the form used by yahil et al .",
    "( 1991 ) in the analysis of the 1.2 jy survey : @xmath22 with its corresponding differential luminosity function @xmath23    a flux - limited sample contains only a small number of very sub - luminous galaxies , making it difficult to determine the luminosity function at these luminosities .",
    "we have followed yahil et al.(1991 ) in imposing a lower limit on luminosity @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the distance corresponding to a velocity of 500 km s@xmath12 , and @xmath26 is the survey flux limit . for @xmath26 = 250 mjy , @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "then the minimum detectable luminosity at distance @xmath29 is @xmath30 .",
    "the probability of detecting a galaxy of luminosity @xmath31 at distance @xmath32 is then @xmath33 the likelihood function is the product of all of these probabilities : @xmath34 this ( reciprocal ) likelihood function is minimized to determine @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . the variance of these parameters is estimated by making use of the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimators for a large sample ( kendall , stuart & ord 1987 ) .",
    "the likelihood function contains ratios of the differential and cumulative luminosity functions , so another calculation is required to find the normalization @xmath38 .",
    "one method is to use the @xmath39 estimator of davis & huchra ( 1982 ) after the shape parameters have been determined .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 is the number density of galaxies with @xmath40 .",
    "( see equations 11 and 13 of yahil et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for the formulas appropriate to our choice of the parametric luminosity function . )",
    "an upper limit to the redshift must be chosen to fix the sample volume used in this density estimator .",
    "based on a calculation of @xmath39 in radial shells , we have chosen an upper limit on redshift of 20,000 km  s@xmath12 ( @xmath41 ) for the normalization of the maximum likelihood fit .",
    "( however , this upper redshift limit is _ not _ applied in determination of the shape of the luminosity function . )",
    "effects of incompleteness or evolution may become significant beyond this redshift .",
    "a maximum - likelihood fit to the density variations of the sample as a function of redshift ( see section [ sec : correct ] ) further indicates that the density is well - behaved to this limit .",
    "a second means of determining the normalization is to require that the number of sources predicted by the luminosity function over some redshift range equals the number in the sample .",
    "computing the normalization from source counts in this way from 500 km s@xmath12 to 20,000 km  s@xmath12 gives essentially the same normalization as the @xmath39 estimator .",
    "the derived parameters for the maximum likelihood fit are listed in table [ tab : fitpars ] .",
    "luminosity functions derived by the @xmath1 method and the parametric maximum likelihood method are shown in figure [ fig : newvis ] .",
    "we show the luminosity functions in the form of the visibility @xmath42 .",
    "the visibility is proportional to the number of galaxies visible per log luminosity bin , and it has the advantage of showing the relative numbers of galaxies in a flux - limited sample .",
    "the open triangles are from the @xmath1 estimate of the entire sample , and the solid curve is the parametric maximum - likelihood fit to galaxies with redshifts greater than 500 km  s@xmath12 , with normalization from a volume - limited sample as described above .",
    "the solid curve is truncated at @xmath43 . the @xmath1 estimate ( made in bins of @xmath44 )",
    "was converted to visibility by multiplying @xmath16 by @xmath45 .    a plot of @xmath21 as a function of luminosity for our sample is included in figure [ fig : vratio1 ] .",
    "the variations in this statistic for the full sample and northern sample at luminosities less than @xmath46 are most likely due to the local supercluster .",
    "the southern sample is much more uniform at these luminosities , supporting this interpretation .",
    "the general agreement between the @xmath1 luminosity function and the shape of the parametric fit in figure [ fig : newvis ] , together with the uniformity of the @xmath21 statistic , confirm that the parametric fit is a good description of the shape of the local luminosity function .",
    "the @xmath1 point at @xmath47 corresponds to the luminosity at which the flux limit samples the virgo cluster , and hence lies well above the solid curve .",
    "the number of galaxies without redshifts ( 17 ) is slightly more than one percent of our sample .",
    "one method for estimating the effects of this known incompleteness on the luminosity function is to assign to each of these galaxies the median redshift of their log flux bin , and recalculate the luminosity function .",
    "when the median redshifts are computed for the whole sample , all the assigned redshifts are around 7,000 km sec@xmath12 .",
    "when the median redshifts are calculated from those galaxies whose redshifts were not obtained from public sources ( a more realistic estimate ) , the assigned redshifts range from 12,000 to 18,000 km sec@xmath12 . since all these galaxies have a 25 @xmath0 m flux density within a factor 1.5 of the flux limit , their luminosities all fall near @xmath37 .",
    "when the luminosity function is recalculated and plotted as a visibility , we have found that the asymptotes are unchanged , and the peak visibility is increased by a few percent .      a non - parametric maximum - likelihood method ( a.k.a `` stepwise maximum likelihood '' ) has been used to calculate the galaxy luminosity function in various surveys ( lynden - bell 1971 ; choloniewski 1986 ; efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 ; saunders et al .",
    "1990 ; marzke et al .",
    "this method does not assume a specific functional form for the luminosity function , but rather describes it by a non - negative step function ( i.e. requires binning ) which makes the observed galaxy luminosity distribution as likely as possible .",
    "we have followed the prescriptions set out by efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and saunders et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for calculating the non - parametric luminosity function .    as in the parametric maximum - likelihood method",
    ", the non - parametric approach also eliminates the effect of any density inhomogeneities , but loses the overall normalization by assuming that the galaxy spatial and luminosity distributions are independent .",
    "the normalization of the non - parametric function has been chosen to give the same source - counts as the parametric function over the same bins .",
    "figure [ fig : lf_swml ] shows the visibility function obtained by using the non - parametric maximum - likelihood method ( circles ) , which agrees within the error bars with our parametric results ( solid line , from figure [ fig : newvis ] ) .",
    "the non - parametric method is commonly used to assess whether the parametric functional form is acceptable .",
    "figure [ fig : lf_swml ] shows that the parametric form of figure [ fig : newvis ] gives a reasonable description of the density - independent 25 @xmath0 m luminosity function .",
    "we have found that the non - parametric function is sensitive to the bin width , however .",
    "figure [ fig : lf_swml ] shows the case for bins in @xmath48 = 0.2 , but for a bin width of 0.4 , the non - parametric results is systematically higher than the parametric curve for high luminosities .",
    "the coarser binning probably results in a loss of information and a less reliable luminosity function .",
    "the choice of bin size is a compromise between this effect and tolerating the statistical uncertainty from having too few sources in each bin .",
    "systematic variations of noise across the sky may change the detection quality and cause incompleteness problems for the sample . in the 25 @xmath0 m passband of iras ,",
    "noise is dominated by photon shot noise from the zodiacal background , and hence is a strong function of the ecliptic latitude .",
    "we have examined the noise variation in the sample and in the corresponding fss plates and found two regions that contain higher noise at @xmath49 m .",
    "they are essentially the two quadrants defined by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which contain the ecliptic plane .",
    "most of the moderate - quality detection sources ( generally , those with snrs between 3 and 5 ) in our sample are in these two regions , indicating the systematic effect .    to estimate this systematic effect on our sample completeness , we compared luminosity functions estimated for two subsamples of our 250-mjy - limited full sample .",
    "the first subsample is defined by raising the flux - density limit to 400 mjy in the two quadrants of the sky @xmath50 and @xmath52 where the noise is systematically higher , and keeping the 250 mjy limit in the other two quadrants .",
    "most of the moderate quality detection sources are left out of this subsample , so we call these 1050 sources the high - quality subsample .",
    "the second subsample consists of those 408 sources in the full sample that are left out of the high - quality subsample , and is therefore a low - quality subsample .",
    "figure [ fig : comphighlowq ] compares the luminosity functions of the high - quality and the low - quality subsamples , using the @xmath1 estimator since it accomodates the different flux limits more easily than either of the maximum - likelihood estimators .",
    "there is no systematic deficiency of galaxies in the low - quality subsample .",
    "the luminosity functions agree within the @xmath9 error bars , with the exception of the point at @xmath47 .",
    "the low - quality subsample includes galaxies in the virgo cluster with 25 @xmath0 m flux densities between 250 and 400 mjy , most of which fall into this luminosity bin .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comphighqwhole ] we compare the @xmath1 luminosity functions of the high - quality subsample and the full 250 mjy - limited sample .",
    "they agree very well , indicating that the full sample is complete at 250 mjy flux - density across the entire sampling sky .",
    "therefore we are confident that the full 250 mjy - limited sample is well - defined .    as another check of the completeness of our full sample ,",
    "we have computed the cumulative probability of finding a galaxy of luminosity @xmath53 at distance @xmath29 , following the method of yahil et al .",
    "this probability is the integral of equation [ eqn : condprob ] and is @xmath54 .",
    "this probability should be uniformly distributed on the interval [ 0,1 ] independent of distance .",
    "if the sample were incomplete at the faint end , we would expect a decrease in the relative number of galaxies as @xmath55 .",
    "we have computed @xmath56 for each galaxy in the sample , then computed the histogram of this statistic in different distance ranges , normalized to 1 in each range .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : compcheck ] .",
    "there is no systematic decrease in the relative galaxy counts as @xmath55 ( albeit the statistics are poor beyond 400 mpc ) .",
    "this result provides further confirmation that our 250 mjy - limited sample is complete to these distances .",
    "since this method relies upon ratios of the luminosity function , it should be insensitive to inhomogeneities in the galaxy distribution .",
    "just as the galaxy luminosity function independent of the inhomogeneities of the density field can be obtained , the spatial density variations independent of the galaxy luminosity function can also be calculated using the maximum - likelihood method ( saunders et al .  1990 ) .",
    "here we only investigate the radial density distribution .",
    "the probability for detecting a source of luminosity @xmath57 at radial distance @xmath58 is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the density at @xmath58 , and @xmath61 is the maximum distance for the source to be included in the sample . the likelihood function for all the detected sources would be @xmath62 , given the density distribution @xmath63 we are trying to calculate . in the non - parametric approach , this distribution can be found by maximizing @xmath64 with respect to the binned density field @xmath65 , which gives @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the number of sources in the @xmath69-th distance bin with volume @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the fraction of the bin contained in @xmath72 $ ] where the @xmath73-th source is observable , and the sum is over all sources .    figure [ fig : den_swml ] illustrates the non - parametric maximum - likelihood estimate of the radial density variation ( solid line ) as compared with the flux - limited observed distribution ( dashed line ) . here",
    "the radial distance bins are in logarithmic scale , and the density variations are normalized to the average density over all bins of interest .",
    "the method correctly recovers the density enhancement at @xmath74 mpc caused by virgo .    we do not find a systematic increase in the radial density at large distances .",
    "if our sample is assumed to be complete , this result means that there is no indication of density evolution in this sample .",
    "we return to this point in section [ sec : evolution ] .",
    "the benefits of calculating the radial density variations in our sample are two - fold .",
    "first , it may be used to correct the @xmath21 statistic and the traditional @xmath1 estimate of the density - dependent luminosity function ( schmidt 1968 ; felton 1977 ) . for the @xmath21 test , since @xmath75 where @xmath63 is the radial density field , @xmath76 is the maximum comoving distance for a source to be included in a sample , and @xmath77 is the effective distance ( longair 1978 ) , we can modify the @xmath21 test so that @xmath78 which gives @xmath79 for an inhomogeneous radial distribution .",
    "this also suggests that we use the @xmath80 in equation [ eqn : bindensity ] instead of @xmath15 in the @xmath1 estimator to calculate a density - corrected luminosity function .",
    "the @xmath63 calculated from the maximum - likelihood method can provide these corrections .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : vmax2 ] for the new @xmath21 values and in figure [ fig : lfvmax ] for the @xmath1 luminosity function .",
    "compared with the results without the inhomogeneity correction in figure [ fig : vratio1 ] , the @xmath21 values are closer to 0.5 for those bins most strongly affected by the local supercluster .",
    "( however , the corrected @xmath21 values are not suitable as a test of the sample completeness , since the density correction will mask any incompleteness in the sample . )",
    "the new @xmath1 luminosity function is smoother and closer to the ones estimated by the maximum - likelihood method . as mentioned in saunders et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , the binning of the distance in figure [ fig : den_swml ] may account for the residual effects of the density inhomogeneities in these figures .",
    "second , the `` true '' density variations in figure [ fig : den_swml ] also correct the observed redshift distribution .",
    "the density - variation - corrected redshift distribution should be predicted by a density - independent luminosity function estimated in the same sample .",
    "this provides an independent test to verify the luminosity function .",
    "figure [ fig : srccnt ] shows our results . here",
    "the dashed histogram is the observed redshift distribution .",
    "( here we show the source - counts in distance bins instead of redshift bins since some galaxies have secondary distances . )",
    "it is divided by the density of the corresponding distance bins in figure [ fig : den_swml ] which gives the solid - line histogram .",
    "the source - counts affected by large - scale structures , such as the ones near virgo , are corrected by this procedure .",
    "the dotted line shows the prediction by the parametric density - independent luminosity function of figure [ fig : newvis ] and table [ tab : fitpars ] .",
    "this prediction fits the solid - line histogram well , demonstrating the reliability of our luminosity function .",
    "both the solid - line histogram and the dotted line are normalized so that they contain the same total number of sources as observed within 20,000 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the preceding sections have presented the 25 @xmath0 m luminosity function calculated by a number of methods . in this section ,",
    "the limitations of the various methods are revisited in greater detail .",
    "the @xmath1 estimate of the luminosity function varies the most from the other estimators , particularly at luminosities less than @xmath37 , where our sample is most strongly influenced by the local supercluster .",
    "as noted above , this estimator assumes that the 3-dimensional galaxy distribution is homogeneous .",
    "the error bars in all of our @xmath1 estimates similarly depend on the assumption of uniformity , and do not reflect the additional uncertainties that arise from an inhomogeneous distribution .",
    "we consider the @xmath1 estimates to be the least reliable descriptions of the 25 @xmath0 m luminosity function out of those we have presented .",
    "the parametric and non - parametric maximum - likelihood estimates should be independent of structures in the galaxy distribution . however , these estimators assume that the luminosity function is independent of density .",
    "this assumption is difficult to check . in the case of a large 60 @xmath0m - selected sample , yahil et al .",
    "( 1991 ) demonstrated that their similarly - derived luminosity function provided a good description of the luminosity distribution of galaxies even in regions of high density .",
    "the non - parametric maximum likelihood method applied to our sample is sensitive to the choice of binning , as described in section [ sec : lfnonpar ] .",
    "we therefore consider the parametric maximum - likelihood description of the 25 @xmath0 m luminosity function with parameters in table [ tab : fitpars ] to be the best out of those we present in this paper .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , soifer & neugebauer ( 1991 ) derived the local luminosity function at 25 @xmath0 m from a complete subsample of the 60-@xmath0m - selected bright galaxy sample ( soifer et al .",
    "this subsample contained 135 galaxies to a flux density limit of 1.26 jy , and the luminosity function was determined using the classical @xmath1 estimator .",
    "their luminosity function is plotted as a space density in figure [ fig : spacedens ] , together with our parametric and @xmath1 estimates .",
    "our flux density limit of 250 mjy samples the virgo cluster at @xmath81 ( section [ sec : parametric ] ) , and our @xmath1 estimate is much higher than the parametric curve in that bin .",
    "the soifer & neugebauer points in figure [ fig : newvis ] in @xmath82 bin is also much higher than the curve , as expected since their flux density limit is five times higher than ours .",
    "we conclude that the soifer & neugebauer luminosity function is strongly affected by the local supercluster , particularly because the bright galaxy sample was selected to be visible from palomar observatory ( soifer et al .  1984 ) and does not include the south galactic cap .      the improved luminosity function that is the main result of this paper has implications the luminosity density of the local universe , infrared number counts predictions at 25 @xmath0 m , and the infrared background expected at this wavelength .",
    "soifer & neugebauer ( 1991 ) calculated the local luminosity density in the four iras passbands based on their derived luminosity functions . at 25 @xmath0 m",
    ", they found that the log of the luminosity density in units of @xmath83 mpc@xmath84 is 7.2 .",
    "integrating our parametric function gives a log luminosity density of 6.9 , which is a factor of 2 lower in linear terms than the soifer & neugebauer result .",
    "the differences in the sub-@xmath37 portion of the luminosity functions account for the different integrated luminosity densities .",
    "hacking & soifer ( 1991 ) presented number count distributions at 25 @xmath0 m , using a fit to the soifer & neugebauer ( 1991 ) luminosity function .",
    "( those authors fit a hyperbola to the visibility function , which has the power - law asymptotes at high and low luminosities like our parametric form , except that it forces the absolute values of the slopes of the asymptotes to be identical . ) as they noted , the soifer & neugebauer functions at other wavelengths are 20%-30% higher than those derived from other samples ( saunders et al . 1990 ) .",
    "our improved 25 @xmath0 m function is similarly about 15% lower in normalization than the soifer & neugebauer estimate .",
    "hence , models based on this luminosity function and its normalization will produce number counts about 15% lower at the bright end than those in figure 1(c ) of hacking & soifer ( 1991 ) .",
    "such a change would bring the number counts in better agreement with the iras number counts presented in their same figure .",
    "finally , we have substituted our luminosity function into the backgrounds model of hacking & soifer ( 1991 ) .",
    "the modified model yields estimates of the infrared background at 25 @xmath0 m that are factors of 2.5 to 2.7 times smaller than the original hacking & soifer estimates .",
    "our results indicate that the detection of an ir background at this wavelength is likely to be even more difficult than previously predicted .      to this point",
    ", we have neglected any effects of galaxy evolution on our derivation of the luminosity function .",
    "since the maximum - likelihood estimators are independent of density variations , the shape of the luminosity function will be unchanged by density evolution of the galaxy population .",
    "our normalization considers galaxies out to 20,000 km  s@xmath12 , a redshift where evolution effects should be small .",
    "more importantly , our maximum likelihood fit to the radial density ( section [ sec : correct ] and figure [ fig : den_swml ] ) does not show a systematic increase with redshift and hence no indication of density evolution .",
    "this result is in direct contrast to that of saunders et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . from their 60-@xmath0m - selected sample",
    ", those authors found that density evolution of @xmath85 matched their radial density fit .",
    "however , we note that the existence of evolution from iras samples is not yet settled  for the deepest iras sample , ashby et al .",
    "( 1996 ) did not find the high - redshift tail expected from strong evolution .",
    "nevertheless , we have computed the shape of the parametric luminosity function for the case of exponential luminosity evolution corresponding to @xmath86 at low redshifts ( cf .",
    "saunders et al .  ( 1990 ) ) , by correcting the luminosity of each galaxy to the present epoch .",
    "the values of the shape parameters of this function are @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "the only change from the function described in table [ tab : fitpars ] is that the slope of the luminosity function at the high - luminosity end is slightly lowered .",
    "the following are the results of this paper :    \\1 . we have selected a sample of 1458 galaxies with redshifts from the iras faint source survey with a flux density limit of 250 mjy at 25 @xmath0 m .",
    "an additional 17 galaxies do not have redshifts available .",
    "the local luminosity function is derived using the @xmath1 estimator and both parametric and non - parametric maximum likelihood methods .",
    "the @xmath1 estimate is significantly affected by the local supercluster .",
    "the maximum likelihood methods are independent of density variations , and we consider the parametric fit with parameters in table [ tab : fitpars ] to be the best estimate of the local luminosity function at 25 @xmath0 m .",
    "a maximum likelihood fit to the radial density in this sample is used to correct the @xmath1 estimate .",
    "the fit shows no sign of a systematic increase with redshift of the density , as would result from density evolution of the galaxy population .",
    "the @xmath1 luminosity function derived from a smaller sample by soifer & neugebauer ( 1991 ) is significantly contaminated by the local supercluster .",
    "predictions of number counts and local luminosity density based on that function are 15 - 20% higher than those indicated by our improved luminosity function .",
    "the new function also leads to lower predictions of the mid - infrared background due to galaxies .",

    "whipple observatory .",
    "we also thank iffat khan and joe mazzarella for assistance with database searches , and carol lonsdale and tom soifer for helpful discussions .",

    "the ned database is supported at ipac by nasa .",
    "we have assumed a distance 17.6 mpc to virgo in the linear virgocentric inflow model ( aaronson et al . 1982 ) to calculate the distance to each galaxy which does not have a secondary distance . to be consistent with our assumption of 75 km  s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 for the hubble constant ,",
    "we have used 1019 km  s@xmath12 as the observed velocity of virgo corrected to the centroid of the local group , and implicitly assumed an infall velocity of about 300 km  s@xmath12 for the local group toward virgo .",
    "the resulting hubble flow velocity of virgo , @xmath901320 km  s@xmath12 , is consistent with many other estimates ( e.g. faber et al .",
    "1989 ; tonry et al . 1990 ; mould et al . 1995 ; huchra 1996 ) .",
    "a different hubble constant would change the distance estimate to virgo if the hubble flow velocity of virgo remains unchanged .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath1 luminosity function assuming no virgocentric inflows , in which we used the redshift as the direct distance measure unless a secondary distance exists for a galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig : flowtst ] compares the @xmath1 luminosity functions for the 250 mjy - limited sample with and without virgocentric inflow . a hubble constant of 75 km  s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 is used in both cases .",
    "the two estimates agree very well .",
    "this indicates that the inflow model we use has a small impact on the estimate of the distance of the galaxies in the sample , and that most of these galaxies are not strongly affected by the gravity from virgo .",
    "note that a luminosity function simply scales with the hubble constant ( the luminosity changes as @xmath91 ) if all distance estimates in a sample are from redshifts .",
    "the number of galaxies with secondary distances in our sample is small ( only 22 ) .",
    "we have done experiments to verify that these galaxies do not contribute statistically significantly to the calculated luminosity function .",
    "we therefore conclude that our results can be simply scaled if a different hubble constant is used .",
