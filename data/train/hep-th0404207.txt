    "the old idea  @xcite that our universe may be a braneworld embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime is renewed by the recent development in string theory which can be consistently formulated only in 10 dimensions  @xcite . instead of 10 dimensions",
    ", however , most studies of braneworld cosmology have been devoted to 5-dimensional models  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the difficulty in treating the higher codimension object in a relativistic manner  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to explore the possibility of the higher codimension braneworld  @xcite .",
    "it is the einstein gauss - bonnet gravity that is a natural framework in 6-dimensions . because a natural extension of einstein gravity to higher dimensions is the lovelock gravity and it reduces to the einstein gauss - bonnet gravity in 6-dimensions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the gauss - bonnet term appears in the low energy effective action in string theory .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to construct a codimension 2 braneworld in the einstein gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "in fact , bostock et al . claimed that 6-dimensional einstein gauss - bonnet gravity leads to a thin braneworld where a conventional einstein gravity holds  @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , they suggested that the deviation to the conventional einstein theory can be possible when the thickness of the brane is taken into account and consequently the variation of the deficit angle is allowed .",
    "however , they have never given a precise scheme to calculate these corrections .",
    "rather , they commented that the corrections can not be fixed exactly by the bulk equations .",
    "therefore , it is important to construct a viable concrete model for the thick braneworld and clarify if corrections can be obtainable or not .    in this paper , we investigate a codimension 2 braneworld in the einstein gauss - bonnet gravity taking into account the thickness .",
    "it is difficult to treat the finite thickness as it is .",
    "however , by examining the structure of the singularity in the equations of motion , we find a possibility to treat the thickness within the context of the distributional source .",
    "we name it a quasi - thick braneworld .",
    "this is the important point in our work which gives a framework to clarify various issues in the codimension 2 braneworld . in the case of the linearized gravity",
    ", we clarify the effect of the bulk on the brane by solving the whole set of equations of motion in the bulk with proper considerations of the boundary conditions .",
    "it turns out that the conventional einstein gravity is recovered at the linear level .",
    "however , we also show some corrections due to the thickness can be expected at the second order level . the effect of the bulk geometry in the nonlinear regime is also discussed .",
    "we conclude that corrections to the conventional einstein theory can be fully obtainable in the case of the quasi - thick braneworld .",
    "we also point out an interesting possibility that the thickness plays a role of the dark energy / dark matter in the universe .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii ,",
    "we present a model for thick braneworld and derive necessary equations .",
    "the structure of the singularity is carefully examined .",
    "then , we introduce an idea of the thick braneworld within the context of the distributional source , which we dub quasi - thickness . in sec.iii , we set the background vacuum spacetime .",
    "in sec.iv , we solve the bulk geometry using linear perturbation theory . in sec.v , the effective theory for the codimension 2 braneworld is presented both in the linear and nonlinear regime .",
    "the consistency of our formalism is emphasized here . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize our results and discuss possible applications and extensions .",
    "we consider a codimension 2 braneworld with a positive tension in the 6-dimensional bulk spacetime . the lovelock gravity is a natural framework in higher dimensions and reduces to the einstein gauss - bonnet gravity in 6-dimensions .",
    "moreover , the gauss - bonnet term ubiquitously appears in the low energy limit of string theory . for this reason ,",

    "we will assume that a 6-dimensional metric has axial symmetry , which reads @xmath14 this assumption corresponds to the @xmath15 symmetry in the randall - sundrum braneworld model .",
    "here we have introduced polar coordinates @xmath16 for the two extra spatial dimensions , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as we locate a four - dimensional brane at @xmath19 , which is a string like defect , we must take the boundary condition @xmath20 where the prime denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath21 .",

    "<S> consequently , we find that the thickness of the brane can be incorporated as the distributional source , which we dub quasi - thickness . on the basis of our formalism , we analyze the linearized gravity and show the conventional einstein gravity can be recovered on the brane . in the nonlinear regime , however , we find corrections due to the thickness and the bulk geometry . </S>",
