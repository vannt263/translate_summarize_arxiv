    "an old dream in quantum gravity @xcite is to define a manifestly spacetime - covariant feynman - style `` sum over trajectories '' @xcite , sufficiently well defined to yield finite results order by order in some expansion .",
    "the hamiltonian theory has obtained encouraging successes in recent years , but it suffers for the well - known lack of transparency of the frozen time formalism , for the difficulty of writing physical observables and for operator ordering ambiguities .",
    "these problems are related to the lack of manifest 4d covariance . here",
    ", we derive a covariant spacetime formalism _ from _ the hamiltonian theory .",
    "this is of course the path followed by feynman to introduce his sum over trajectories in the first place @xcite .",
    "what we obtain is surprising : we obtain a formulation of quantum gravity as a sum over surfaces in spacetime .",
    "the surfaces capture the gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "the formulation is `` topological '' in the sense that one must sum over topologically inequivalent surfaces only , and the contribution of each surface depends on its topology only .",
    "this contribution is given by the product of elementary `` vertices '' , namely points where the surface branches .",
    "the sum turns out to be finite and explicitly computable order by order .",
    "the main result of this paper is the construction of this finite `` sum over surfaces '' formulation of quantum gravity .",
    "let us sketch here the lines of the construction .",
    "given gravitational data on a spacelike hyper - surface @xmath0 , the three - geometry on a surface @xmath1 at a proper time @xmath2 in the future of @xmath0 ( as measured along geodesics initially at rest on @xmath0 ) , is uniquely determined in the classical theory .",
    "it is then natural to study the corresponding evolution operator @xmath3 , that propagates states from @xmath0 to @xmath1 in the quantum theory .",
    "this operator , first considered by teitelboim @xcite , codes the dynamics of the quantum gravitational field , and is analogous to the feynman - nambu proper time propagator @xcite for a relativistic particle . here",
    ", we construct the operator @xmath3 in quantum gr , and we expand it in powers of @xmath2 .",
    "we obtain a remarkable result : the expansion is finite order by order .",
    "this is our first result .",
    "next , we construct a graphical representation of the expansion . this is obtained by observing that topologically inequivalent colored 2d surfaces @xmath4 in spacetime provide a natural bookkeeping device for the terms of the expansion .",
    "we obtain an expression for @xmath3 as a sum of terms labeled by surfaces @xmath4 bounded by initial and final states . a surface @xmath4 consists of simple components ( 2-manifolds ) , or `` faces '' , that carry a positive integer or color .",
    "faces meet on 1d `` edges '' , colored as well .",
    "edges , in turn , meet at branching points , denoted `` vertices '' .",
    "the weight of each surface in the sum is a product of factors associated to its vertices .",
    "the value of a vertex is determined by the hamiltonian constraint , and is given by a simple function ( involving wigner @xmath5-@xmath6 symbols ) of the colors of the adjacent faces and edges .",
    "this `` sum over surfaces '' version of the dynamics of quantum general relativity is our second result .",
    "the construction allows us to consider transformation properties of the hamiltonian constraint under 4d diffeomorphisms ( diff ) in a manifestly covariant way .",
    "this analysis suggests the addition of certain new terms to the constraint , corresponding to an alternative operator ordering , which implements a `` crossing '' symmetry at the vertices , with a nice geometrical appeal .",
    "thus , 4d diff invariance may be a key for reducing the present ambiguity in the operator ordering .",
    "furthermore , the new terms seem to prevent some potential problems with locality pointed out by smolin @xcite .",
    "the introduction of these new terms in the quantum hamiltonian is our third result .",
    "the idea that one could express the dynamics of quantum gravity in terms of a sum over surfaces has been advocated in the past , particularly by baez @xcite and reisenberger @xcite . on the lattice ,",
    "a sum over surfaces was recently developed by reisenberger @xcite , and the lattice construction has guided us for the continuum case studied here .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that the present construction is entirely derived from the canonical quantum theory in the continuum .",
    "the sum over surfaces we obtain has striking similarities with topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) .",
    "more precisely , it has the same kinematic as the ooguri - crane - yetter model @xcite , a 4d tqft which extends the ponzano - regge - turaev - viro 3d tqft @xcite to four dimensions .",
    "essentially , the difference is given just by the weight of the vertices . in appendix",
    "b we discuss similarities and differences between the two theories .",
    "the discussion , we believe , sheds much light over the tantalizing issue @xcite of the relation between finite - number - of - degrees - of - freedom tqft and quantum gravity .",
    "in particular , we argue that a diff - invariant quantum field theory with an _ infinite _ number of local ( but non - localized ) degrees of freedom such as quantum general relativity can be obtained by having a sum over arbitrarily fine triangulations , instead of triangulation independence , as in combinatorial tqfts .    on the other hand",
    ", the sum over surfaces we obtain can be viewed as ( a first step towards ) a concrete implementation of hawking s sum over 4-geometries @xcite .",
    "in fact , the surfaces over which we sum have an immediate interpretation as `` quantum '' 4-geometries , as we will illustrate .",
    "this fact should make the the general techniques of covariant generalized quantum mechanics @xcite available to quantum gravity , potentially simplifying the difficulties with physical observables of the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the basis of our construction is loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the finiteness of the sum - over - surfaces and the picture of a `` discrete 4-geometry '' that emerges from this work are related to the fact that geometrical operators have discrete spectra .",
    "the discreteness of the spectra of area and volume and the `` quantized '' structure of space that these spectra suggests is a central result in loop quantum gravity , first obtained by rovelli and smolin in @xcite , and later confirmed and clarified by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient of our construction is the quantum hamiltonian constraint @xcite . in particular ,",
    "thiemann s version of the hamiltonian constraint @xcite and some variants of it play an essential role here .",
    "matrix elements of this operator have been computed explicitly in @xcite , using the methods developed in @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we summarize the basics of nonperturbative loop quantum gravity . in section iii",
    "we define the proper time propagator and its expansion . in section",
    "iv we show that the proper time propagator can be expressed as a sum over surfaces . in section",
    "v we discuss crossing symmetry and the new terms of the hamiltonian constraint . in section vi we summarize and comment our results .",

    "the hilbert space @xmath7 of the theory is spanned by the basis @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a spin network @xcite .",

    "they represent our main result .",
    "above , we have considered a _ reformulation _ of loop quantum gravity as of a sum over surfaces . here",
    "we propose a _ modification _ of the theory , suggested by the reformulation .",
    "the value of the vertex @xmath213 that we have computed in the last section depends on two inputs .",
    "first , on the coloring of the edges and faces adjacent to the vertex @xmath223 .",
    "second , on the distinction between `` past '' and `` future '' edges , namely on the way the vertex is located and oriented within the surface @xmath4 .",
    "we suspect that the appearance of this orientation dependence is a sign that something has got wrong in the definition of the theory .",
    "the action of gr is local and 4-d diff invariant , and therefore the action of the 4-geometry of a small region ( `` the vertex '' ) is independent of how this region is sliced by equal time slices .",
    "thus , we propose a modification of the theory in which the orientation dependence is removed .",
    "we say , in general , that in a theory defined by a sum over branched colored surfaces , with weights given by products of vertex factors , the vertex is `` crossing symmetry '' if its value depends on the adjacent colorings only , and not on the distinction between past and future edges .",
    "bf theory @xcite and simplicial gr @xcite are theories of this kind , and have crossing symmetric vertices . in section v.a .",
    ", we study the modification of the geometry of the vertex required to make it crossing symmetric .",
    "we then say that a hamiltonian constraint operator @xmath89 has crossing symmetry if it defines a crossing - symmetric vertex via eq.([av ] ) .",
    "the modification of the vertex that we consider in section v.a might be obtained from a different factor ordering of the hamiltonian constraint , and , as we shall see below , is strictly related 4d diff - invariance .",
    "thus , here we are exploring the idea that 4d diff - invariance might fix residual factor ordering ambiguities .",
    "of course , it should not be surprising that a spacetime formalism could simplify the discussion of 4d diff - invariance , a notoriously tricky issue in the hamiltonian framework .",
    "let us make clear that we present crossing symmetry only as a proposal to be explored .",
    "we do not have a rigorous derivation of crossing symmetry from first principles , but only a heuristic plausibility argument , which we better detail below .",
    "consider the path integral that formally defines @xmath3 in a proper time gauge , namely in a gauge in which the lapse is spatially constant .",
    "consider a 4-metric @xmath134 , that contributes to this path integral and a small spacetime region @xmath238 , and let @xmath239 be the restriction of @xmath134 to @xmath238 .",
    "the region @xmath238 is sliced by the proper time slicing .",
    "let @xmath240 be the exponential of the action of this region .",
    "if the region is small enough , we can think of @xmath240 as the matrix element of the evolution operator between `` before @xmath238 '' and `` after @xmath238 '' , where `` before '' and `` after '' are determined by the proper time slicing , and thus identify @xmath240 with the vertex @xmath213 .",
    "now consider a different 4-metric @xmath241 in the integral , containing a region @xmath242 , such that @xmath243 is isometric to @xmath239 , but sliced in a different manner by the proper time slicing ( the reader will easily convince himself that such a metric exists in general ) . since the action is local and 4-d diff invariant , the contribution of @xmath239 to the sum must be equal to the contribution of @xmath243 , namely @xmath244 .",
    "this implies that the matrix elements of the proper time hamiltonian between `` before '' and `` after '' according to one slicing of @xmath238 ought to be the same as the matrix elements of between `` before '' and `` after '' according any other slicing . in other words ,",
    "the matrix elements should be invariant under a 4d rotation of @xmath238 that changes what is before and what is after .",
    "if we require the same to hold in our sum over surfaces , we obtain the requirement that vertices be crossing symmetric .",
    "this discussion shows that there is a relation between 4d diff invariance and crossing symmetry , because a 4d diffeomorphism `` rotates '' the vertex in 4d .",
    "recall that the 4d diff invariance of the classical theory is expressed by the poisson brackets @xmath245,\\ c[m]\\right\\ } = c[n\\vec\\partial m - m\\vec\\partial n ] .",
    "\\label{pobr}\\ ] ] one of the hard problems of the hamiltonian quantization program is to define a quantization of the hamiltonian constraint yielding a 4d diffeo invariant quantum theory . in particular , implementation of 4d diff invariance",
    "is presumably the missing ingredient for fixing quantization ambiguities of the hamiltonian constraint . recall that the ambiguity in the definition of @xmath42 $ ] was fixed in @xcite and @xcite to a large extent arbitrarily .",
    "full implementation of the quantum version of ( [ pobr ] ) should ensure 4d diff invariance , but has proven hard to realize .",
    "we are therefore lead to the suggestion that we can cure the slicing dependence by taking advantage of the remaining operator ordering ambiguity , and at the same time , cure the excessive ordering ambiguity by imposing slicing independence . in other words",
    ", we can _ impose some form of 4d diff - invariance requirement in order to reduce quantization ambiguity_. here we are suggesting that in a covariant formalism crossing symmetry might be the key for implementing 4d diff invariance .",
    "let us investigate meaning and consequences of requiring crossing symmetry .",
    "first , we should require that different ways of cutting @xmath232 with three nodes on one side and one node on the other yield the same @xmath213 .",
    "this leads to conditions on the @xmath222 coefficients , that will be studied elsewhere .",
    "a more interesting case is the following .",
    "first , let us help intuition by redrawing the elementary vertex of the theory ( figure 4 ) in a more symmetric way .",
    "this is done in figure 7 .",
    "( for simplicity , we restrict the following analysis to trivalent nodes . )",
    "there are five topologically inequivalent ways of cutting @xmath232 , giving , respectively @xmath246 ( number of initial and final nodes ) equal to ( 0,4 ) , ( 1,3 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,1 ) and ( 4,0 ) .",
    "the last two are the time reversal of the first two , leaving three genuinely independent cases . in figure 8",
    ", we show the possible cuts , and the corresponding spin networks transitions in the hamiltonian picture .",
    "time reversed cuts give just the opposite transitions .    case ( 1,3 ) is the one described in the previous section ( figure 6 ) .",
    "crossing symmetry requires that the hamiltonian constraint generate the transitions ( 0,4 ) and ( 2,2 )  described in the last column of figure 8 as well , _ with the same amplitude_.    consider these two new transitions .",
    "we begin with ( 0,4 ) ( second line in figure 8) .",
    "this transition represents a matrix element of a hamiltonian that creates a `` small '' tetrahedron from the state with no loops . the fact that 4d invariance requires",
    "the presence of such `` birth '' terms has already been argued , on general grounds , in @xcite . in terms of surfaces ,",
    "the term looks as in figure 9 .    this is _ the very same surface as in figure 4 , and in figure 7 _ ; but drawn with a different orientation in `` spacetime '' . with this orientation , it describes a tetrahedral spin network emerging from nothing .",
    "can such a term originate from an ordering of the hamiltonian constraint ?",
    "surprisingly , the answer is positive .",
    "we sketch here an hand waving argument .",
    "the regularized hamiltonian constraint ( @xmath247 ) is formed two parts : s `` small loop '' that corresponds to the classical curvature ( @xmath248 ) term ; and the term that `` grasps '' : the two hands of the @xmath249 operator in @xcite ( or the volume operator in @xcite ) , corresponding to the triads @xmath250 ( or the triads multiplied by a suitable density factor ) .",
    "traditionally , the order chosen is @xmath247 : the `` small loops '' is added _ after _ the grasping .",
    "reverse this order , choosing @xmath251 , and have the small loop being inserted first .",
    "then the hamiltonian constraint has non - vanishing action on the vacuum as well , because the grasping term can grasp the `` small loop '' .",
    "in particular , this may create a `` small '' tetrahedron .",
    "for instance , in the construction in @xcite , the @xmath249 can grasp itself , producing , precisely , a tetrahedron .",
    "see figure 10 .",
    "the ( 2,2 ) term ( third line of figure 8) gives a rearranging of two nodes .",
    "the corresponding surface looks as in figure 11 .",
    "again , this is just a different orientation of the same elementary vertex .",
    "now , we could search for an ordering of @xmath42 $ ] yielding a vertex having crossing symmetry .",
    "but this task is superfluous since we already know what we should obtain .",
    "we can directly _ postulate _ that the hamiltonian constraint yield crossing symmetry , and deduce the amplitudes of the ( 0,4 ) and ( 2,2 ) matrix elements from the value of the ( 1,3 ) vertex . )",
    "can be seen as a first step in this covariantisation of the operator : it is equivalent to the postulate that the ( 3,1 ) cut has the same value as the ( 1,3 ) cut . ]",
    "there is a physical motivation that supports the above argument .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that the orderings of the hamiltonian constraint studied so far generate a dynamical evolution that appear to be excessively `` local '' .",
    "they preserve the general structure of the network on which they act , simply `` dressing '' nodes .",
    "these difficulties have been recently detailed in ref.@xcite , where it is argued that no long range interaction is likely to emerge from a hamiltonian with these features . as pointed out by thiemann ,",
    "the argument is far from conclusive , because it contains a jump from the non - physical ( gauge ) coordinate evolution to the physical one , and this jump may be un ungranted . in any case , adding the new vertices ( 2,2 ) and ( 0,4 ) would cure these potential difficulties .",
    "also , we note that one of the consequences of adding the new vertices is that the faces of the surfaces in the sum do not need anymore to be ( topologically ) two - disks , as followed from the original hamiltonian expansion , and there is no sense in the requirement of the surfaces being well - ordered .",
    "finally , notice that one could also search for the form of the vertices from general a priori requirements .",
    "an arbitrary crossing symmetric vertex is obtained by replacing ( [ av ] ) with a function @xmath252 of the spin network @xmath232 associated to the vertex @xmath253 for instance , for trivalent nodes , @xmath232 is a tetrahedron : the function @xmath254 must respect tetrahedral invariance .",

    "more precisely , the proper time propagator of quantum gr can be expressed in terms of a sum over topologically inequivalent branched colored surfaces , bounded by the initial and final s - knots .",
    "the contribution of each surface to the sum is the product of one factor per each vertex ( branching point ) of the surface .",
    "the contribution a each vertex is a simple @xmath59-invariant function @xmath259 of the colors of the faces and edges adjacent to the vertex .",
    "this function characterizes the quantum theory in the same manner in which the feynman graph vertices characterize a quantum field theory .",
    "the vertex @xmath259 of general relativity is given by a product of wigner @xmath260 symbols @xcite .",
    "the essential property of the expansion ( [ expansion2 ] ) is that it is finite order by order , and explicitly computable .",
    "this finiteness is intriguing . in order to calculate physical quantities , we must have the proper time propagator for multifingered proper times and we must integrate over the multifingered proper time .",
    "we expect that the integration could yield finite results if performed over expectation values of appropriate physical quantities .",
    "work is in progress in this direction , and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we close with some comments .    *",
    "our construction is strongly reminiscent of discretized quantum gravity on a lattice @xcite , particularly in its simplicial formulations @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that one can discretize general relativity over a simplicial lattice , and express the gravitational degrees of freedom as colored branched surfaces over the ( dual ) two - skeleton .",
    "even more remarkably , the partition function is given in the discretized case by a construction very similar to that given here : the contribution of a vertex is determined by the intersection between the boundary of a 4-simplex around the branching point of the surfaces , and the surface .",
    "this defines a spin network @xmath232 , which , in the discretized case , can be any subgraph of the 1-skeleton of a 4-simplex",
    ". therefore vertices have up to 5 edges and 10 faces ( see appendix b ) in the discretized case . in this paper ,",
    "nonvanishing vertices have 4 edges and an arbitrary number of faces .",
    "thus , the simplicial construction corresponds to a cut of the sum ( [ uno ] ) in two respects : the maximum number of vertices is fixed by the triangulation , and vertices have 10 faces at most .",
    "* one can view the sum over surfaces defined here as a version of hawkings integral over 4-geometries .",
    "indeed , a colored two surface defines a discrete 4-geometry .",
    "the integral is replaced here by a sum , and explicit computation can be performed .",
    "presumably , the construction then be used to define a number of related theoretical tools as partition function , hartle - hawking state , and similar @xcite . *",
    "each individual term in the expansion ( [ e ] ) is finite .",
    "divergences can arise in summing the series , and in integrating over proper time .",
    "* the similarity with the formulation of string theory as a path integral over worldsheets is tantalizing . on this , see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "the _ dynamics _ is different . in string theory ,",
    "the contribution of each surface to the sum is given by the area of the surface , and therefore it depends on a fixed background metric on the manifold . here",
    ", on the contrary , the contribution of each surface depends only on the ( coloring and ) topology of the surface .",
    "thus , quantum gr resembles a `` background independent '' version of string theory .",

    "it was shown that the prtv model is a theory of the dynamics of spin networks ( loops in the terminology of @xcite ) having the same physical interpretation as the spin network basis states in continuum 3d gr .",

    "if we accept the not unreasonable hypothesis that @xmath3 is a partial sum of terms in a sum over surfaces for @xmath105 in gr , we can compare the theories in a direct way . *",
    "the vertex factor is different in the two theories : in bf theory it is a 15-@xmath6 symbol , while in gr it is a combination of 9-@xmath6 and 6-@xmath6 symbols .",
    "this difference depends on the different dynamics of the two theories , and should be at the root of the other differences . * in the case of bf theory there is a crucial theorem holding : triangulation independence .",
    "refining the triangulation does not change the overall sum .",
    "this is the reason for which the theory is topological , and is a consequence of the fact that the classical theory has no local degrees of freedom . in gr ,",
    "nothing similar holds , because gr has genuine local ( _ although non - localized !",
    "_ ) degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore there is no reason to expect anything like triangulation independence for gr . *",
    "the ensemble of surfaces over which the sum is defined is different in the two cases . in the bf case",
    ", we sum over surfaces over a fixed triangulation . in the case of gr",
    ", we sum over all topologically inequivalent surfaces , with an arbitrary number of vertices . therefore , in the case of bf theory the surfaces to be consider are finite in number . in the case of gr",
    "we have to sum over arbitrarily complicated surfaces , or , equivalently , sum over arbitrarily fine triangulations of the manifold as well .",
    "notice that this difference is a consequence of the previous point , namely triangulation independence of bf .",
    "we could average over arbitrarily fine triangulations in bf as well ; but this would not affect the result , because each triangulation yields the same contribution as the coarsest one . therefore : _ diff invariance of the sum is implemented in two different ways in bf and in gr , corresponding to the fact that bf is topological , while gr is not : in bf , invariance is obtained thanks to triangulation independence ; in gr invariance is obtained by summing over arbitrarily fine triangulations .",
    "_ * the rigorous version of bf theory requires @xmath59 to be replaced by quantum @xmath59 .",
    "this can be seen simply as a smart stratagem for regularizing the sum in an invariant manner , yielding a finite result .",
    "notice that in gr regularizing @xmath59 to quantum @xmath59 would not guarantee an overall finite sum , because the surfaces themselves are infinite in number .",
    "thus , quantum gr does not admit a rigorous finite version as quantum bf , at least as far as we can presently see , even if one attempts to replace @xmath59 with quantum @xmath59 in gr @xcite . *",

    "these points illuminate the difference between quantum gr and topological field theories .",
    "let us discuss this point in more detail .",
    "both theories are invariant under diffeomorphism .",
    "however , diffeomorphism invariance does not imply that a quantum theory is topological in the sense of having a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we expect gr to have an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "thus atiyah s axioms for topological quantum field theory are likely to be suitable for quantum general relativity as well , if we drop the request that the hilbert spaces attached to boundaries of the four - manifold be finite dimensional .",
    "finally , we may turn the comparison the other way around , and describe quantum bf theory in the language so far used for quantum gr .",
    "we can capture quantum bf theory in terms of its vertex .",
    "a bf vertex has five edges and ten faces .",
    "assume that one of these edges comes from the past , and four go to the future ( the other cases are given by crossing symmetry , that clearly holds in bf theory ) .",
    "a moment of reflection shows that the elementary vertex of bf theory `` opens up '' a four - valent intersection of a spin - network into a `` small '' tetrahedron :    the matrix element of the hamiltonian between these two ( partial ) spin networks is the 15-@xmath6 symbol of the 15 colors associated to the four links and the one node of the incoming spin network , and the six other links and four other nodes of the newly created tetrahedron .",
    "it would be interesting to derive this hamiltonian from a hamiltonian loop quantization of bf theory .",
    "we work out here an example of diff - invariant scalar product between s - knot states @xcite .",
    "( on the inner product between spin networks see @xcite , and @xcite which we follow here ) .",
    "let @xmath31 be the s - knot defined as follows .",
    "@xmath31 has three 4-valent nodes , @xmath284 and @xmath285 , and the six links @xmath286 where each link is indicated by the two nodes it connects and its color .",
    "explicitly :      to specify the state , we have to give also the coloring of the nodes .",
    "we choose an expansion of the nodes in a trivalent graph ( in each node ) by pairing the two links colored 2 and 4 .",
    "we have one virtual link for every node ( we denote them @xmath288 and @xmath289 ) , which we assume to be colored as follows : @xmath290 and @xmath291 , where @xmath292 ( which can take the values 6 , 4 and 2 ) will be specified later on @xmath293 next , let us define the s - knot @xmath294 .",
    "let it be the same as above , but with a different coloring of the node @xmath6 .",
    "we expand @xmath6 by pairing @xmath295 with @xmath296 and @xmath297 with @xmath298 .",
    "let the internal link have color 3 : @xmath299 let us compute the scalar product @xmath300 .",
    "first , we have to list the automorphisms of the spin network ( taking links colors , but not node s colors into account ) .",
    "there is only one non trivial automorphism @xmath78 : it exchanges @xmath45 and @xmath6 .",
    "thus , ( [ product ] ) gives @xmath301 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 have been selected to have the same graph , with the same colored links .",
    "the only contribution to ( [ sp1 ] ) comes from the nodes .",
    "the node @xmath285 is the same in the two states and therefore gives no contribution ( recall we have chosen normalized states ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath302 where we have indicated with @xmath303 the scalar product restricted to the space of one node .",
    "spin - network states with the same trivalent expansion are orthonormal .",
    "the change of basis is given @xcite by the recoupling theorem @xmath304 where the quantities @xmath305 are @xmath265 six - j symbols ( normalized as in @xcite ) .",
    "this gives us immediately @xmath306 therefore @xmath307 thus , if @xmath292 = 6 there are two contributions to the scalar product , one from each of the two elements of the automorphism group of the spin network and we have @xmath308 while if @xmath309 or @xmath310 @xmath311                            g ponzano , t regge , in _ spectroscopy and group theoretical methods in physics _ ed by f bloch ( north holland , amsterdam 1968 ) .",
