    "rydberg systems are ballooned - up atoms which can be made by exciting the outermost electron in certain elements , so that all the inner electrons can lumped together and regarded , along with the atom s nucleus , as a unified core , with the lone remaining electron lying outside @xcite .",
    "thus , they are as if the atom were a hydrogenic system , a heavy version of hydrogen . due to their extraordinary properties ( high magnetic susceptibility , long lifetime , high kinetic energy ,  ) these systems , where the outermost electrons are highly excited but not ionized , have been used in multiple scientific areas ranging from plasmas and diamagnetism to astrophysics , quantum chaos and strongly interacting systems .",
    "recently it has been argued that they might be just the basic elements for processing quantum information ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , these outsized atoms can be sustained for a long time in a quantum superposition condition ( what is very convenient for creating qubits ) and they can interact strongly with other such atoms ; this property makes them very useful for devising the kind of logic gates needed to process information .",

    "it embraces a large variety of three - dimensional physical systems ( e.g. , hydrogenic atoms and ions , exotic atoms , antimatter atoms , rydberg atoms ,  ) and a number of nanotechnological objects which have been shown to be very useful in semiconductor nanostructures ( e.g. , quantum wells , wires and dots ) @xcite and quantum computation ( e.g. , qubits ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , it plays a crucial role for the interpretation of numerous phenomena of quantum cosmology @xcite and quantum field theory @xcite .",
