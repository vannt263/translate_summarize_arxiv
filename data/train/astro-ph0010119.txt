    "the classification of `` active '' galaxies based on their optical spectra alone provides an incomplete or even deceiving description of the true nature ot this class of objects . in some `` classical '' starburst galaxies ,",
    "x - ray and vlbi observations have found indications for the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared ( mir ) spectroscopy with iso has shown that some galaxies , which were optically classified as agns , are in fact dominated by starbursts .",
    "conversely , the presence of a heavily obscured agn was revealed in some systems previously classified as starburst @xcite .",
    "mid - ir observations are particularly useful for detecting dust - enshrouded agns for a number of reasons .",
    "most importantly , the mir is much less affected by dust extinction than , e.g. , the optical regime ( @xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "while the extinction is even lower at far - ir wavelengths , warm dust emission in the @xmath3 regime can be powered both by agns and starbursts and is therefore not distinctive of the nature of activity .",
    "in contrast , significant emission from hot dust at wavelengths between 2 and @xmath4 is generally characteristic of heating by an active nucleus @xcite .",
    "finally , the mir allows diffraction - limited , arcsecond - scale imaging from large ground - based telescopes , in contrast to observations at far - ir wavelengths which have to rely on space observatories with limited aperture sizes and hence limited resolution . as a case in point ,",
    "mir spectroscopy with iso is often unable to detect the nuclear hot dust emission , since the host galaxy and circumnuclear starburst emission dilute the nuclear agn emission in the large beam of the iso observations .",
    "a classical example is ngc4945 .",
    "this galaxy hosts one of the brightest agns at @xmath5 , although the x - ray source is heavily absorbed ( @xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "however , both optical and near - ir data do not show any indication for the presence of the active nucleus and appear , instead , dominated by a powerful nuclear starburst along with its superwind cavity @xcite .",
    "even the mir iso spectra appear dominated by the starburst @xcite .",
    "because of the reasons outlined above , sensitive mir observations with high spatial resolution hold the promise to identify heavily obscured agns within starburst galaxies , even if they are missed in optical and near - ir imaging and/or in iso spectroscopy , both because of heavy obscuration or dilution by the nuclear starbursting activity .",
    "if such mir observations were to find that the fraction of galaxies with agns is significantly higher than estimated from optical , near - ir , or iso mir surveys , it would provide support to the idea of a connection between starbursts and agns , which has been suggested by various studies @xcite .",
    "the observations described here were carried out with maniac , the mid- and nearinfrared array camera @xcite .",
    "the data were taken during a four week period in february / march 1998 at the eso / mpi @xmath7 telescope in lasilla , chile .",
    "most galaxies were observed during multiple nights with varying integration times .",
    "table  [ tbl - obs ] summarizes the target list and observational parameters .",
    "all galaxies were observed through the maniac n - band filter which comprises the spectral region between 8 and @xmath8 .",
    "we employed standard chopping and beam switching techniques to account for the high and rapidly variable sky emission in the mid - infrared regime . in brief , a large number of frames with typical integration times of a few milliseconds are co - added in a hardware buffer for both the on - source and off - source chopper position .",
    "both buffer sums are saved to the maniac control pc after typically 30  s , corrected for bad pixels , and subtracted from each other .",
    "we offset the telescope by exactly one chop throw about every minute to correct for the slightly different illumination patterns in the two chop beams .",
    "because most of our objects are fairly compact , we decided to keep the chop throw small enough that the `` off '' beams still fell on the chip .",
    "subtraction of the two difference images images obtained at both beam positions then yields a triple image of the source in which the thermal background from sky and telescope is reduced to about @xmath9 .",
    "this procedure , which has been described in more detail in @xcite , improves the signal to noise ratio for a given integration time , since the `` off '' beam images can be combined with the center image .",
    "however , in the case of an extended source , overlap of the negative beams with the center image can cause confusion . while there are algorithms that can recover the information in the overlap regions @xcite we did not attempt to employ such reconstruction methods because we are mainly interested in the nuclear , often unresolved , source for which this problem is not important .    since the data for many of our targets were taken over several nights with varying seeing conditions , we smoothed the maps of the individual nights to the worst nights seeing profile by convolving with appropriate gaussians .",
    "the maps then were shifted to a common center position , and median combined .",
    "images taken under the best seeing conditions were used to determine the upper limits on the size of the point - like nuclear source for each object ( see table  [ tbl - obs ] ) .    in order to discriminate between the flux of the unresolved nuclear source and the underlying extended emission",
    ", we constructed a mean point spread function ( psf ) from standard star images close in time to the respective galaxy observations during each night .",
    "more specifically , we weighted the standard star images by each night s effective integration time on the galaxy before averaging .",
    "we then scaled the resulting `` galaxy specific '' psf appropriately to subtract the nuclear source , and derived the integrated flux .",
    "the scale factor was determined such that no residual unresolved emission remained after subtraction while assuring a smooth interpolation of the underlying extended emission ( if present ) .",
    "the quality of the subtraction of the point source and remaining uncertainties were assessed by inspecting the images .",
    "table  [ tbl - photometry ] lists the calibrated fluxes of both emission components of all target galaxies together with their @xmath10 uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainties include contibutions from the absolute calibration , background level , and psf fitting .",
    "flux calibration of the data was performed via observations of the stars @xmath11  vel and @xmath12  cru , with assumed n - band magnitudes of -1.78 and -3.36 , respectively .",
    "we have adopted the vega - based photometric system , with the n - band zeropoint corresponding to @xmath13 .",
    "the objects observed with maniac were selected to have at least some indications of nuclear ( seyfert ) activity and non - negligible mid - ir emission .",
    "more specifically , we selected observable `` active '' nuclei whose central 10@xmath14 m emission is brighter than @xmath150.3 jy based on previous ground - based observations ( @xmath16 aperture , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we present the resulting n - band maps of our sample of galaxies in figure  [ fig - maps ] .",
    "table  [ tbl - photometry ] summarizes the n - band photometry of the unresolved nuclear component and of the extended emission ( if present ) as derived from these images .",
    "we also list in table  [ tbl - photometry ] literature values for the visual extinction towards the central region as inferred by various indicators such as narrow emission lines , pah features and near - ir colors of the stellar population which typically trace the extinction on scales of a few hundred pc .",
    "more details on our extinction estimates are given below in the discussion of individual objects .",
    "the adopted extinction values were used to derive the unobscured n - band flux of the nuclear point source by assuming that it is affected by the same reddening as the circumnuclear region .",
    "we caution , however , that in the context of the unified model for seyfert nuclei , the @xmath4 emission is believed to originate from an obscuring torus on scales much smaller than the circum - nuclear starburst , typically a few pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the extinction values table  [ tbl - photometry ] more likely represent lower limits for the true extinction towards to mir emission .",
    "this issue is discussed further in  [ subsec : correlation ] .",
    "in addition , table  [ tbl - photometry ] contains x - ray fluxes in the @xmath17 energy band .",
    "these were taken from the literature , and typically have been corrected for the photoelectric absorption as measured in the same band .",
    "details are again given in the discussion of the individual objects below .",
    "the extinction inferred from the optical and ir indicators is generally much lower than that derived from gas column densities as measured in the x - rays by assuming a galactic dust - to - gas ratio and extinction curve .",
    "this effect is at least partly due to the larger size of the region sampled by optical and ir indicators as discussed above ( few @xmath18 ) compared to the nuclear x - ray source and the putative obscuring torus .",
    "also , various pieces of evidence suggest that the dust in the circumnuclear region of agns is characterized by properties significantly different from the galactic diffuse interstellar medium which is most likely the reason for the reduced @xmath19 ratio commonly observed in this class of objects @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we briefly discuss the n - band morphology as derived from the maps in figure  [ fig - maps ] , the x - ray data , and extinction estimate of all sample targets on an individual basis .",
    "ngc1808 is a morphologically peculiar starburst galaxy @xcite , which has being suspected of harbouring a hidden seyfert nucleus @xcite . in particular",
    ", the decline of the hard x - ray flux suggests that the nuclear activity has been gradually fading during the past few years @xcite .",
    "our n - band image shows a pronounced nucleus sourrounded by strong extended emission .",
    "the extended emission can safely be attributed to the extended starburst @xcite .",
    "the total n - band flux within @xmath20 is in excellent agreement with the @xmath21 iras flux of @xmath22 . the nuclear point source only accounts for less than 8% of the total flux .",
    "ngc4945 is a bright infrared galaxy revealing a powerful starburst in its nuclear region @xcite .",
    "evidence for a heavily obscured agn comes from hard x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "however , ngc4945 is peculiar in that the the agn has not yet been succesfully traced , neither in the nir @xcite nor in the mir @xcite .",
    "so far , the role of the agn for the bolometric luminosity has remained unclear .",
    "our n - band image reveals for the first time an unresolved point source at the nucleus of ngc4945 together with strong extended emission along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the extracted observed n - band flux of the central source is only 8% of the total n - band flux of ngc4945 , which has been determined within an ellipse @xmath23 tilted to match the major axis of the galaxy ( table  [ tbl - photometry ] ) .",
    "our total n - band flux within this area is consistent with iso observations @xcite .",
    "the low value for the nuclear emission in conjunction with the dilution of the much larger iso beam explains why iso has not detected the agn .",
    "the extinction towards the central region can be assessed from mir data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite determined the spatially averaged ( @xmath24 ) extinction towards the circumnuclear starburst and find @xmath25 within a 50% error .",
    "this value is probably a lower limit since usually the foreground extinction rised towards the nucleus .",
    "indeed , the nuclear ( @xmath26 ) isocam spectrum of ngc4945 indicates a much higher extinction , based on the ratio of the 6.2@xmath14 m and 7.7@xmath14 m pah features @xcite . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath27 with an uncertainty of 40% .",
    "circinus is the closest _ bona fide _",
    "seyfert  2 galaxy .",
    "it is characterized by a prominent ionization cone , extending to the north - west , and by a circimnuclear starburst ring with a radius of about @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the active nucleus of circinus is heavily obscured by a large column density of gas ( @xmath30 , * ? ? ?",
    "the n - band map of circinus is dominated by the central nuclear point souce .",
    "its flux is so high that limits in the bandwidths of the electronic detector readout circuitry result in a notable elongated shadow of the nucleus towards south .",
    "since the emission morphology can not be reliably determined over the affected area , it has been masked out in the image .",
    "the eastern and western boundaries of the image are defined by residual signals from the negative beams due to chopping and nodding , which have also been masked out .",
    "our image also shows circumnuclear n - band emission , which has not been detected previously .",
    "this continuum emission is rather smothly distributed but shows a shallow peak with a flux level of @xmath31 offset by @xmath32 from the nucleus .",
    "this position coincides with the intersection of the major axis and the circumnuclear ring where a region of intense star formation is found @xcite .",
    "perpendicular to the major axis of circinus , in particular towards the north - west the region of the cone of the nlr @xcite , we find significantly less extended emission .    subtracting a stellar psf from the radial profile of the nuclear source reveals a small deviation from the psf profile , peaking at about @xmath33 at a radius of @xmath34 ( figure  [ fig - profile ] ) .",
    "given the limited spatial resolution of our images this possible extended emission needs to be confirmed at higher spatial resolution .",
    "however , it can not be explained by seeing - induced broadening of the psf .      at a distance of @xmath35 , centaurus a is one of the closest agns in our sample , along with ngc4945 and circinus .",
    "the presence of a hidden active nucleus is revealed both through its hard x - ray emission and the presence of a radio jet @xcite . the notion of an agn in centaurus  a is also supported by our n - band image which only reveals a prominent unresolved central source ( not shown in figure  [ fig - maps ] ) .",
    "while @xcite found extended mir emission from iso observations , our high resolution image is not sensitive to such diffuse emission on scales much larger than the maniac field of view .",
    "nevertheless , the photometry of the nuclear source is unaffected from this uncertainty because it is measured differentially against the background .",
    "our n - band image of ngc6240 was obtained during an earlier observing run in 1997 .",
    "it is dominated by the two nuclei of the well known merger system ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which are just resolved in our map .",
    "the southern nucleus is about twice as bright as the northern one ( table  [ tbl - photometry ] ) .",
    "the low - level structure in our map does indicate the presence of faint extended emission in the vicinity of the nuclei , consistent with @xcite .",
    "however , its contribution to the overall flux is only minor . for flux calibration , we used the photometry of @xcite , since the maniac calibration was not yet well established for these earlier observations",
    "hard x - ray observations provide evidence for the presence of a powerful agn which is heavily absorbed by a column density of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "their absorption - corrected @xmath17 luminosity is @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) which places this object in the qso luminosity range @xcite .",
    "the n - band map of ngc3081 reveals a point source which is most likely due to dust emission associated with the seyfert  2 nucleus .",
    "any extended emission is below our detection limit , even if integrated over an aperture of 25@xmath39 in diameter ( table  [ tbl - photometry ] ) .",
    "assuming that the foreground extinction is comparable to values determined by @xcite from nir lines towards the narrow line region , we adopt @xmath40 .    the image of ngc3281 is also dominated by a point source .",
    "in addition , there is marginal evidence for an extended emission component in our map .",
    "while its detailed morphology is probably not reliable , the residual flux within a 25@xmath39 aperture after subtraction of the unresolved component is about 13% of the point source flux . despite the uncertainties in the zero level of the map ,",
    "this is significant .",
    "if true , the integrated extended emission puts an upper limit to the extended flux per beam to about @xmath41 , which is more than 1000 times fainter than the nucleus .",
    "our n - band flux density is consistent with j through m photometry by @xcite .",
    "ngc1566 , the brightest member of the doradus group , is an almost face on spiral galaxy with a seyfert nucleus .",
    "the exact classification , however , varies in the literature between seyfert  1 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and",
    "seyfert 2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our n - band map ( not shown in figure  [ fig - maps ] ) reveals a point source with no significant circumnuclear emission above our sensitivity limit .    for ngc1566 ,",
    "no @xmath17 data are available . from einstein data , @xcite determine a @xmath42 flux of @xmath43 ( converted to our h@xmath44 ) .",
    "@xcite do not find evidence for foreground absorption in excess to the galactic value , based on rosat data . by extrapolating the @xmath42 flux to the @xmath17 band with a typical photon index of 1.7 , we obtain @xmath45 , where the large errors account for the uncertainty in the spectral slope .      in order to compare the mir and x - ray properties of seyfert galaxies with those of prototypical starburst galaxies , we searched the literature for additional objects with both high resolution mir images and hard x - ray fluxes .",
    "table  [ tbl - comp ] lists the results of our search including the references that contain the relevant data .",
    "some of the objects ( ngc7552 and ngc253 ) have also been observed with the maniac camera , and have been reduced in an identical fashion . in general , there is a scarcity of high - resolution mir maps of starburst galaxies , a fact that is likely to change in the near future due to the comissioning of a number of large ir telescopes such as gemini or the large binocular telescope .",
    "specific aspects of the objects in table  [ tbl - comp ] are discussed in the appendix .",
    "generally , the mid - ir continuum emission from the central region of agns is ascribed to thermal emission from dust which is irradiated by the nuclear uv - optical radiation , and possibly associated to the obscuring torus postulated by the unified model @xcite .",
    "typical dust temperatures are about 300 k. for the luminosities of most of the seyfert nuclei considered here ( @xmath47 of a few times @xmath48 ) an equilibrium temperature of about @xmath49 is reached at a distance of a few pc from the nuclear source @xcite . with our high signal - to - noise mid - ir images we can set an upper limit of about @xmath50 on the size of the nuclear unresolved source , which corresponds to a projected size of @xmath51 ( for circinus , cena , ngc4945 ) , @xmath52 ( for ngc1808 , ngc1566 ) , and between @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the more distant targets , i.e. consistent with the size of the warm dust emitting region discussed above .",
    "compared to normal and sb galaxies , agns are generally very effective in heating dust to temperatures high enough to emit at mid - ir wavelengths @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the detection of an unresolved mid - ir source in the galactic nucleus is generally a good indication for the presence of an agn . in this regard , the identification of nuclear unresolved mir emission in our n - band maps of ngc4945 , ngc3081 , ngc3281 , and ngc1566 is a case in point . in particular , all previous attempts to detect the nucleus of ngc4945 have remained unsuccessful , even at nir wavelengths @xcite .    on the other hand , the presence of an unresolved mir nucleus alone is not necessarily a proof for the presence of an agn .",
    "starburst galaxies may also harbor unresolved nuclear emission .",
    "for example , both ngc7552 and ngc1808 have nuclear point sources in the mir , yet they show no signs for an agn ( see discussion below ) .    in summary , detecting and isolating the nuclear @xmath4 flux provides a necessary prerequisite to further constrain the nuclear activity of galaxies , but it alone is not sufficient to distinguish between various kinds of nuclear activity .      the x - ray emission from agns is generally assigned to the nuclear engine itself .",
    "the strong uv / optical continuum radiation is believed to be responsible for heating the circumnuclear dust , which in turn is the source of the nuclear mir emission via thermal radiation .",
    "therefore , a correlation between x - ray and mir nuclear radiation in agns would be a natural result .    in most type",
    "2 seyferts , large column densities of cold gas along the line of sight absorb the soft x - ray flux . in particular",
    ", the superposition of the absorption edges of various metals introduces a photoelectric cutoff towards the lower energies .",
    "the energy of the cutoff increases with the gaseous column density along the line of sight .",
    "however , as mentioned above , at energies above the photoelectric cutoff ( generally in the range @xmath1 ) , it is possible to observe the transmitted radiation and to infer the intrinsic ( absorption - corrected ) luminosity of the nuclear source @xcite .",
    "if the absorbing column is thick to compton scattering ( @xmath55 ) , the radiation is completely absorbed up to at least @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the traditional `` hard '' x - ray band between 2 and @xmath56 is dominated by scattered and reflected radiation .",
    "if the column density is not higher than about @xmath57 , x - rays in the @xmath58 band are at least partly transmitted , and can indeed be observed with x - ray satellites sensitive in this band ( e.g. bepposax ) . in such cases ,",
    "the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of the nuclear source can be inferred .",
    "examples for this method include ngc4945 , circinus , or ngc6240 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath17 emission of starburst galaxies without an agn is mainly produced by young supernova remnants , x - ray binaries and/or hot diffuse gas , the latter possibly produced in supernova induced superwinds @xcite . however , the cumulative hard x - ray emission of these components is significantly weaker than the emission produced by agns ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "on the other hand , the young stellar population in starburst galaxies is quite effective in heating the dust which radiates mir thermal emission and in exciting the pah features which also contributes significantly to the mir observed flux .",
    "therefore , a comparison of the nuclear @xmath4 emission with the intrinsic ( i.e. absorption - corrected ) nuclear @xmath17 x - ray flux should allow to discriminate between star formation and active nuclei . in practice , however , one has to account for an additional complication .",
    "the nuclear component of the @xmath17 radiation can not be determined with the same spatial resolution as the nuclear @xmath4 emission , because the angular resolution of satellites with hard x - ray sensitivity such as asca or bepposax is limited to @xmath59 , so that in cases where both starburst and agn activity is present , the x - ray measurements may contain contributions from both sources . for his reason",
    "one has to be cautious when determining the nature of these nuclei based on @xmath17 data alone .",
    "only the combination of nuclear mir and hard x - ray emission seems to provide a reliable tool for constraining the nature of the nuclear activity of theses sources , as demonstrated in the next section .      in figure  [ fig - plot ]",
    ", we compare the @xmath4 flux density of the unresolved nuclear component to the observed x - ray fluxes in the @xmath17 band after correction for their respective absorptions .",
    "the error bars account for uncertainties in the photometry itself and in the estimates for foreground extinction ( see table  [ tbl - photometry ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - plot ] shows that , within the statistical limits of our sample , the nuclear mir flux density of type 2 seyferts is proportional to the intrinsic hard x - ray flux .",
    "four other seyfert  1 galaxies , for which we found comparable data ( ngc7469 , ngc4051 , ngc4151 and ngc3227 ) , follow the same correlation , which is robust against modifying single values by factors of the order of 2 .",
    "a similar correlation holds for the starburst galaxies , however , their hard x - ray flux is about a factor of 15 less than for seyferts .",
    "the straight lines in figure  [ fig - plot ] are linear fits to the data which have been forced to cross the origin .",
    "ngc6240 lies significantly above the correlation and will be discussed further down .",
    "the proportionality between the n - band and x - ray flux densities in figure  [ fig - plot ] is encouraging .",
    "the correction on the x - ray emission is quite accurate : even in the most extremely obscured cases ( ngc4945 , ngc6240 ) the uncertainty is below a factor of 2 , which is small when reported on a logarithmic scale . in previous attempts to find similar correlations between x - ray and mir / fir fluxes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no correlation had been found or the scatter was much larger , mostly due to lack of spatial resolution and sensitivity . having established the existence of a correlation in flux , we can now convert to luminosities in order to investigate correlations between intrinsic properties of the galaxies . by doing so",
    ", i.e. multiplying the mir and x - ray fluxes of each object in both axis by the square of the distance and some factors , the data points in figure  [ fig - plot ] will be rearranged parallel to the solid line , thus conserving the scatter of the correlation .",
    "the result is displayed in figure  [ fig - lum ] . within the uncertainties and excluding ngc6240 for the moment , the distribution is still compatible with a slope of 1 ( solid line in figure  [ fig - plot ] ) , covering more that 3 orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "the location of ngc6240 in figure  [ fig - lum ] is above the correlation for the other seyfert galaxies .",
    "more specifically , is is overluminous in hard x - rays by about an order of magnitude .",
    "possibly , the dust extinction towards the nucleus of ngc6240 is much higher than assumed based on nir colors @xcite . indeed , ngc6240 is the most distant object of our sample and the observations sample larger spatial scales ( @xmath15kpc ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that extinction estimates are diluted by regions farther from the nucleus with lower optical depths and that the intrinsic mid - ir emission of ngc6240 is higher than derived from our data .",
    "thus , a much larger fraction of the radiation of the very hot dust may already have been reprocessed and shifted to longer wavelengths before it left the nuclear environment .",
    "a foreground extinction in the range a@xmath60 mag is required to increase the dereddened nuclear n - band emission such that ngc6240 complies with the correlation of the other agns .",
    "the nuclear @xmath4 fluxes were corrected for the extinction observed in the circumnuclear region as inferred from either nir color maps , recombination line ratios or from the ratio between pah features .",
    "the fact that the tight correlation between @xmath4 and x - ray fluxes appears to be the same for both seyfert types indicates that the @xmath4 emission from the nuclear source is not affected by an extinction much higher than inferred for the circumnuclear region .",
    "this indicates that either the @xmath4 emitting region is more extended than the putative obscuring torus predicted by the unified model for agns , or that the optical depth of the torus is not much higher than that of the circumnuclear region for these objects .",
    "this result appears to be in contradiction with previous studies which claimed significant differences in the nuclear @xmath4 emission between obscured and unobscured seyferts @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can probably be explained by limited angular resolution and sensitivity of those earlier studies .",
    "an alternative explanation which is likely to important at least to some extent stems from the selection criteria of our sample .",
    "because the maniac targets were selected to have strong nuclear mir emission , the sample is potentially biased towrads agns which are little absorbed at this wavelength .",
    "therefore , possible differences between different classes of seyferts in terms of their mid - ir absorption might have been missed .",
    "additional high resolution mir observations of seyfert nuclei are required to solve this issue .",
    "the x - ray emission from the comparison sample of pure ( to present knowledge ) starburst nuclei in figure  [ fig - lum ] is significantly lower and appears to follow a line with a slope different from proportionality .",
    "we caution that the apparently different slope might be caused by the small number statistics of our sample . on the other hand",
    ", it can plausibly be explained by the very different aperture sizes that were used for the measurements : about @xmath61 for the n - band and between @xmath62 and about @xmath63 for the x - rays .",
    "thus , for starburst galaxies , one would measure hard x - rays from almost the entire extended starburst region , but only a distance - dependent fraction of the n - band emission . in support of this argument",
    ", we note that using a larger aperture for the mir measurement , e.g. the @xmath64 iras luminosity from table  [ tbl - comp ] , the proportionality slope appears to be restored ( although at increased scatter ) , as shown in figure  [ fig - lum ] on the lower right .",
    "the vertical distance between the two proportionality lines is a factor of 190 , which indicates the different physical processes that prevail in these two classes of objects . more specifically ,",
    "classical starburst galaxies appear to have x - ray fluxes that are a large factor of almost 200 below those of agns with similar @xmath4 emission .",
    "yet , we can not completely rule out that the nuclear unresolved @xmath4 source in some of the starburst nuclei ( e.g. ngc  7552 ) is the counterpart of a heavily obscured agn .",
    "indeed , if the nuclear obscuring medium is completely compton thick ( @xmath65 ) , the @xmath17 emission from the agn would be completely suppressed and instead be dominated by the starburst radiation .",
    "an important result of our study is that in figure  [ fig - plot ] , ngc4945 definitely falls into the region occupied by agns , despite the rather large uncertainty of its intrinsic @xmath4 flux .",
    "this result suggests that the unresolved nuclear mir source is indeed powered by the obscured active nucleus detected in hard x - rays .",
    "the position of ngc1808 in the regime of starburst galaxies suggests that the active nucleus in this galaxy - if present at all - has faded @xcite .",
    "currently , the x - ray and mir emission are instead dominated by an ( unresolved ) circum - nuclear starburst .",
    "it is also interesting that the archetypical starburst galaxy m82 falls into the regime of the seyfert nuclei .",
    "this statement is robust against any uncertainty in the x - ray flux due to the observed variability . in order for m82 to fall into the regime occupied by starburst nuclei",
    ", its x - ray flux should have to be a factor of 30 lower in figure  [ fig - plot ] , certainly incompatible with observations .",
    "we therefore concluded that m82 is likely to harbor an agn , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , subsequent observations with chandra at about @xmath66 spatial resolution suggest that a highly variable source about @xmath67 off the nucleus , which is dominating the hard x - ray flux , is compatible with a mid - mass black hole candidate @xcite .",
    "if this can be proven it would explain the location of m82 in figure  [ fig - plot ] , since the same kind of physics is applied . in figure  [ fig - lum",
    "] , the n - band luminosity of the m82 black hole candidate has been corrected for the @xmath67 offset and slightly shifted its position .",
    "it is important to note that the position of m82 in the diagram largely depends on the mir aperture .",
    "this provides additional support for the argument already discussed with ngc4945 : a weak agn can easily be diluted and `` drowned '' in a large beam due to circumnuclear starburst activity .",
    "this demonstrates the need for observations with the highest possible spatial resolution if the correlation is to be extended towards more distant targets .",
    "otherwise , less luminous agns will be easily missed at higher distances .",
    "previous studies found evidence for extended mid - ir emission in seyfert 2 galaxies based on the comparison between ground - based observations and iras data @xcite .",
    "such extended emission is ascribed to enhanced star forming activity in the host galaxies of these obscured active nuclei .",
    "our images show such extended emission in most of the objects of our sample , thus supporting and reinforcing those early results , although with limited statistics .",
    "furthermore , our images indicate that generally the starforming activity occurs in the vicinity of the active nucleus ( within a few 100 pc ) .",
    "this supports the idea of a tight connection between starburst and agn activity as claimed in the past by various authors based both on observational and theoretical grounds @xcite .",
    "we have presented new n - band maps of a sample of 8 nearby seyfert galaxies . in all of our targets",
    ", we have identified an unresolved nuclear emission source , some of which were previously undetected . in those cases where additional extended emission is present ,",
    "we have separated the unresolved component by means of psf fitting .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of high resolution mir imaging for detecting agn and isolating them from the extended emission component .    after complementing our sample by literature data for a number of starburst galaxies and some additional seyferts ,",
    "we have compared the mir luminosity of the nuclear sources to their hard x - ray emission .",
    "we find that both `` pure '' starbursts and agn follow a tight mir ",
    "x - ray correlation , but the two populations are separated by about a factor of 15 without and 190 with aperture correction in their hard x - ray fluxes . we propose to use this correlation as a powerful diagnostic tool to distinguish between these two classes of objects in cases where evidence for nuclear activity is ambiguous .",
    "we are grateful to a number of people who have contributed significantly to the success of the maniac observing campaigns .",
    "in particular , we are indebted to john storey , craig smith , thomas lehmann , and gerd jakob .",
    "we also wish to thank the eso staff at lasilla for their support , and especially ueli weilenmann and hans gemperlein for help with the chopper control electronics .",
    "we thank the referee , bob joseph , for helpful comments to improve this paper .",
    "the nuclear emission of the starburst galaxy * ngc253 * was derived from the @xmath68 continuum image of @xcite which is in good agreement with that published by @xcite .",
    "we estimate the background level at the location of the nucleus of ngc253 to be of the order of 20% of the peak flux in figure  2 of @xcite , whereas the nucleus is at 40% of the peak flux in the figure .",
    "accounting for the fact that the spectral band of the data of @xcite is not identical with the n - band , we estimate the n - band flux to be @xmath69 .",
    "the nuclear emission of the prototypical starburst galaxy * m82 * was derived using the data of @xcite . from their figure  5",
    ", we estimate that the upper limit to the contribution of the nucleus is @xmath70 , which corresponds to one contour spacing in their figure .",
    "the foreground extinction was estimated using @xcite and @xcite .",
    "m82 shows variable hard x - ray flux @xcite , which led these authors to speculate about wether m82 might be harboring an agn .",
    "we used the amplitude of the variability @xcite as a realistic value for the uncertainty of the x - ray flux level .",
    "the seyfert  1 galaxy * ngc7469 * was included in this list to compare with the seyfert  2 targets .",
    "taking into accout the differences in bandwidth and wavelength between @xcite and @xcite we obtain an n - band flux of the nucleus alone of @xmath71 .",
    "* ngc7552 * is a starburst galaxy with a prototypical circum - nuclear starburst ring seen in the near- and mid - infrared .",
    "the n - band map of @xcite also shows a faint nuclear source .",
    "we obtained the n - band flux of the nucleus from table  2a in @xcite , estimating that about 1/3 of the flux within @xmath61 are due to the background emission .",
    "@xcite determined an absorption corrected @xmath72 x - ray flux of @xmath73 , consistent with @xcite , who find variable fluxes in the range @xmath74 .",
    "they assumed a low absorbing column density consistent with the derived low @xmath75 number above . assuming a shape of the x - ray spectrum of ngc7552 similar to other starburst galaxies in @xcite",
    ", one can assess the @xmath1 flux to be about 1/3 of the @xmath72 flux or @xmath76 .",
    "* ngc3690 * is a merging system with an eastern and western component .",
    "the sum of their nuclear n - band fluxes can be obtained from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 hard x - ray flux is integrated over both nuclei , with only low foreground absorbing column density @xcite .",
    "individual hard x - ray fluxes for the two dominant components of ngc3690 are not yet available .",
    "however , the combined mid - infrared and hard x - ray fluxes of both nuclei can safely be used in this investigation since both nuclei show only starburst activity , without any evidence for an agn .",
    "the nuclear n - band flux of the starburst galaxy * ngc3256 * was determined to be 1.7 jy within @xmath77 @xcite and 1.9 jy within 14@xmath78 @xcite .",
    "however , according to the map in @xcite the nucleus is dominated by a point source sourrounded by notable extended emission within this aperture .",
    "we therefore adopt for the flux density of the nucleus alone 0.9 jy , which is about half of the value above .",
    "* ngc6946*:the background subtracted nuclear n - band flux density derived from the @xmath79 resolution map of @xcite is 250@xmath80 , assuming that the lowest contour reflects the background .",
    "n - band aperture photometry of different sizes by @xcite sums to @xmath81 within @xmath82 .",
    "therefore we average the n - band flux density to @xmath83 .",
    "the absorption corrected @xmath17 x - ray flux can be read off figure  2 and table  12 ( source s3 ) of @xcite .",
    "however , comparison of their data with rosat @xmath84 data of @xcite , in particular his figure  4 , clearly shows that the x - ray sources do not necessarily coincide with the nucleus of ngc6946 .",
    "the offset between s3 in @xcite and the nucleus is about @xmath20 , which is supported by comparing his optical plate with a high - resolution hst image , e.g. by @xcite .",
    "significant contribution to the @xmath17 flux from strong circumnuclear sources are probable and we therefore only account half of the adopted @xmath17 flux of @xmath85 to the nucleus .    * ngc4051 * , * ngc3227 * and * ngc4151 * : mid - infrared data for these seyfert 1.2 to 1.5 galaxies are obtained from @xcite and @xcite , who used 6 and @xmath86 apertures , respectively . for ngc4051 we used the x - ray flux prior to the temporary fading of this source reported by @xcite .",
    "the errors on the x - ray fluxes account for the variability of these sources @xcite .",
