    "the local to global study of geometries was a major trend of 20th century geometry , with remarkable developments achieved particularly in riemannian geometry .",
    "in contrast , in areas such as lorentz geometry , familiar to us as the space - time of relativity theory , and more generally in pseudo - riemannian . ] geometries , as well as in various other kinds of geometry ( symplectic , complex geometry ,  ) , surprising little is known about global properties of the geometry even if we impose a locally homogeneous structure .    on the other hand , in the representation theory of lie groups and in the area of global analysis that applies it ( noncommutative harmonic analysis ) , the great trends of development throughout the 20th century include the generalizations @xmath3 within their terms of study , and together with these , the appearance of ground - breaking new research methods ; these moreover deepened relations with various areas of mathematics , such as pdes , functional analysis , differential and algebraic geometry .    against this background , from around the mid 1980s ,",
    "i began to envisage the possibility of developing the theory of discontinuous groups also in the world of pseudo - riemannian manifolds .",
    "soon afterwards , i succeeded in proving a necessary and sufficient condition for the calabi ",
    "markus phenomenon to occur , and , stimulated by this , launched a systematic study of the general theory of discontinuous groups of homogeneous spaces that have good geometric structures , but are not necessarily riemannian manifolds ; for example , semisimple symmetric spaces or adjoint orbit spaces .    whereas the theory of discontinuous groups of riemannian symmetric spaces had been the center of wide and deep developments for more than a hundred years , at the time in the 1980s ,",
    "practically no other researchers were interested in the theory of discontinuous groups for non - riemannian homogeneous spaces ; although the starting point was solitary , whatever i did was a new development .",
    "after the publication of the series of papers containing foundational results @xcite@xcite , @xcite , from the early 1990s , specialists in other areas from france and the united states such as benoist , labourie , zimmer , lipsman , witte and so on eventually started to join in the study of this problem .",
    "after this , research methods developed rapidly over the following 10 years or so , and the ideas concerning discontinuous groups of non - riemannian homogeneous spaces have come to relate to many areas of mathematics , including not only lie group theory and discrete group theory , but also differential geometry , algebra , ergodic theory , mechanical systems , unitary representation theory and so on ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,  ) , so much so that already no single mathematician can hope to cover them all .",
    "for example , the recent researches of margulis , oh , shalom and myself ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) can be viewed as another instance of the same trend , where the fundamental question of understanding the distinction between a discrete group action and a discontinuous group for a non - riemannian homogeneous space begins to tie in to the at first sight unrelated subject of the restriction of a unitary representation to a noncompact subgroup .    as an introduction to this article",
    ", we review and put in order the simplest examples ( in some sense ) of spaces `` of constant curvature '' , and discuss what kind of problems we propose to pursue , and what is the current state of knowledge concerning the `` possible global forms '' of these spaces .",
    "to set these things up precisely we recall the following definitions .",
    "a pseudo - riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature is a _ space form_.    for example , for signature @xmath4 ( riemannian manifolds ) , the sphere @xmath5 is a space form of positive curvature , and hyperbolic space a space form of negative curvature . for signature @xmath6 ( lorentz manifolds ) , _ de  sitter space _ is a space form of positive curvature , _ minkowski space _ a space form of zero curvature , and _ anti - de  sitter space _ a space form of negative curvature .    here",
    "since we are interested in global properties , when we say space form , we assume that the geometry is geodesically complete .",
    "the main topic we consider in this section is the following question :    local assumption : : :    among pseudo - riemannian space forms changes its signature    from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , and its curvature    from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "] of signature    @xmath7 and curvature @xmath9 , global conclusion : : :    do there exist any compact examples ?   : :    and if so , what types of group can appear as their fundamental groups ?      the sphere @xmath11 , the torus @xmath12 , and the closed riemann surface @xmath13 of genus @xmath14 can be given riemannian metrics to make them respectively into space forms of positive , zero and negative curvature .",
    "in other words , in two dimensional riemannian geometry , there exists a space form of any curvature @xmath9 .",
    "the same holds in general dimensions .",
    "however , in the case of lorentz signature @xmath15 , there do not exist any compact space form with @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , the sphere @xmath11 and the riemann surface @xmath13 with @xmath14 do not even admit a lorentz metric . and if @xmath12 can be given a lorentz metric of constant curvature @xmath9 then @xmath17 by the gauss  bonnet theorem .      among riemannian manifolds ,",
    "the sphere @xmath5 is the typical model for a space form of positive curvature .",
    "conversely , the only complete space forms with this property are @xmath5 , or at most @xmath5 divided by a suitable finite group .",
    "we recall two classical theorems generalizing the fact that `` a space form of positive curvature has finite fundamental group '' .    in one direction ,",
    "we leave unchanged the positive definite property of the metric form ( that is , a riemannian manifold ) , and perturb the curvature ( or the metric itself ) .",
    "suppose that the ricci curvature of a complete riemannian manifold has a positive lower bound .",
    "then the fundamental group is finite , and the manifold is compact .    in the other direction ,",
    "we now leave unchanged the positive definite property of the curvature , but vary the positive definite assumption on the metric form ( that is , the condition for a riemannian manifold )",
    ".    in lorentz geometry of dimension @xmath18 , a space form of positive curvature has finite fundamental group , and is noncompact .",
    "theorem  2 can be formulated more generally , with _",
    "pseudo - riemannian manifold of general signature _ in place of lorentz manifold , and _ locally homogeneous space _ in place of constant sectional curvature .",
    "we can formalize this as the problem of discontinuous groups for homogeneous spaces . here",
    "we say that a discrete subgroup @xmath19 of @xmath0 is a discontinuous group for the homogeneous space @xmath1 to mean that the left action of @xmath19 on @xmath1 is properly discontinuous and free ( for more details , see section  2 ) .",
    "the following result is formulated so as to contain theorem  2 as a special case .",
    "let @xmath20 be a pair of reductive lie groups ; then the homogeneous space @xmath1 admits a discontinuous group of infinite order if and only if @xmath21 .    in the opposite directions ,",
    "testing this theorem on various examples of homogenous spaces leads one to believe that the following conjecture may hold :    assume that @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "suppose that the sectional curvature of a complete pseudo - riemannian manifold of signature @xmath7 has a positive lower bound .",
    "then the fundamental group is finite and the manifold is noncompact .      among riemannian manifolds ,",
    "the @xmath24-dimensional torus @xmath25 is the typical example of a space form of curvature 0 .",
    "its fundamental group @xmath26 is an abelian group .",
    "more generally , the following theorem says that the fundamental group of a space form of curvature  0 is also close to an abelian group :    the fundamental group of a complete riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature  @xmath27 contains an abelian subgroup of finite index .",
    "whether the analogous result holds for a pseudo - riemannian manifold is still unknown :    the fundamental group of a compact pseudo - riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature  @xmath27 contains a solvable subgroup of finite index .",
    "conjecture  6 is true for a lorentz manifold ( goldman and kamishima 1984 @xcite , tomanov ) .",
    "more generally , one can extend the bieberbach theorem under the assumption of an affine manifold .",
    "this is the original auslander conjecture .",
    "one can also envisage a stronger form :    is it true that any discontinuous group ( see section  2 ) for affine space @xmath28 contains a solvable subgroup of finite index ?    in 1983",
    "margulis gave a counterexample to this conjecture of milnor in dimension @xmath29 ( theorem  11 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the following proposition is a continuous analog of milnor s problem :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a connected subgroup of the affine group that acts properly on @xmath30 ( see section  2 ) is amenable ; that is , it is a compact extension of a solvable group . _",

    "although the original auslander conjecture remains open , abels , margulis and soifer ( 1997 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have announced that it holds in dimension @xmath31 .",
    "also , on a related topic , the lipsman conjecture ( 1995 , @xcite ) on discontinuous groups of nilmanifolds and their proper actions is known .",
    "definitive results on the lipsman conjecture have been obtained in very recent work of nasrin , yoshino , baklouti and khlif .",
    "namely , it is true if the nilmanifold has dimension  @xmath32 @xcite , and there is a counterexamples in dimension @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is true for lie groups that are at most 3-step nilpotent ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and there is a counterexample for 4-step nilpotent or more @xcite .      in the case of riemannian manifolds , negatively curved compact space forms ( hyperbolic manifolds ) exist .",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that the lorentz groups @xmath34 admit uniform lattices .",
    "however , for general pseudo - riemannian manifolds , the fundamental problem of knowing for which signature @xmath7 there exist _ compact space forms ( of negative curvature ) _ is still not completely settled as things stand .",

    "whether the condition of conjecture  8 is necessary is still not settled , although it is proved to hold in many cases , such as @xmath41 , or @xmath42 , or @xmath43 odd . the final `` odd condition '' on @xmath44",
    "was extended to general reductive homogeneous spaces ( the most typical pseudo - riemannian homogeneous spaces ) by ono and myself @xcite , by a method generalizing hirzebruch proportionality for characteristic classes .",
    "( for more details on these topics , we refer to the references given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite . )",
    "even though the problem of space forms treats extremely special spaces , as discussed in the preceding section , many problems remain open .",

    "in the case of riemannian manifolds , subgroups consisting of isometries satisfy @xmath46 however , for pseudo - riemannian manifolds and for subgroups consisting of isometries , these conditions are not equivalent : @xmath47 and the quotient space by the action of a discrete group is not necessarily hausdorff .",
    "for example , the orbit of a discrete group is not necessarily a closed set ; this corresponds to the fact that in the topology of the quotient space , a single point is not a closed point , and in particular the quotient topology is not hausdorff .",
    "there are thus cases when the quotient is non - hausdorff for local reasons . however , hausdorff is a global property of a topological space , and there are also more curious counterexamples .",
    "the following example is one such . here",
    "the quotient topology is non - hausdorff for a global reason , because accumulation points do not exist .. ]    make the discrete group @xmath48 act on @xmath49 by the map @xmath50 given by @xmath51 .",
    "thus the @xmath48-orbits are contained in the hyperbolas @xmath52 or in the @xmath53- and @xmath54-axes ;    -orbits ]    in figure  1 the crosses @xmath55 represent a @xmath48-orbit contained in the first quadrant .",
    "this @xmath48-action does not have any accumulation points in @xmath56 , but the quotient space @xmath57 is non - hausdorff .",
    "in fact , by considering the fiber bundle @xmath58 , one sees that the quotient space @xmath57 is homeomorphic to an @xmath59 fiber bundle over the base space illustrated in figure  2 ,     four half - lines and four points ( a complete system of representatives ) ]    consisting of four half - lines and four points , given a non - hausdorff topology .    how to understand this kind of example in group theoretic terms is the main topic of sections  23 . as a preparation , we introduce some pieces of basic terminology .",
    "the set - up we consider is a topological group @xmath19 with a continuous action on a space @xmath56 ; we write @xmath60 for this action . for @xmath61 a subset , we define the subset @xmath62 as follows : @xmath63    1 .",

    "the action of a noncompact group is not necessarily well behaved .",
    "the notion of a `` proper action '' ( palais 1961 @xcite ) abstracts out the `` good property '' of a compact group action . putting together as above the notion of properly discontinuous gives rise to the following equation : @xmath67 thus , in order to determine whether the action of a discrete group is properly discontinuous , it is enough to determine whether the action is proper .",
    "this last point has wide applications .",
    "now , for a group @xmath19 acting on a set @xmath56 , we write @xmath68 for the set of equivalence classes of the equivalence relation given by @xmath69 we can view @xmath68 as the set of @xmath19-orbits in @xmath56 , so we call it the _ orbit space _ ( or @xmath19-orbit space ) .",
    "the reason for considering properly discontinuous actions of @xmath19 is the following well - known result :    let @xmath56 be a manifold ( respectively @xmath70 manifold , pseudo - riemannian manifold , complex manifold , etc . ) , and suppose that a discrete group @xmath19 acts on @xmath56 continuously ( respectively smoothly , isometrically , biholomorphically , etc . ) .",
    "if the action of @xmath19 is properly discontinuous and free then the quotient topology on @xmath68 is hausdorff , and the quotient @xmath68 can be given a unique manifold structure for which the quotient map @xmath71 is a local homeomorphism ( respectively local diffeomorphism , local pseudo - isometry , locally biholomorphic ) .    in what follows",
