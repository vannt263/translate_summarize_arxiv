    "the serp - e-190 experiment ( project thermalization ) is carried out at upgraded setup svd-2 ( spectrometer with vertex detector ) , which is irradiated with 50 gev proton beam from u-70 ihep ( protvino ) accelerator .",
    "the setup is equipped with a liquid hydrogen target , a microstrip silicon vertex detector ( vd ) , a drift tube tracker , magnetic spectrometer , cherenkov counter and an electromagnetic calorimeter for photon detection ( dega ) @xcite .",
    "project thermalization is aimed at studying processes with high multiplicity in pp - interactions , which are one of fundamental regions of hadron physics .",
    "it is not possible to describe them with perturbative qcd .",
    "the theory gives only a qualitative picture of these processes .",
    "the multiplicity distribution at 50 gev was measured earlier @xcite up to the number of charged particles @xmath4=16 with average number of charged particles at this energy @xmath5=5.3 .",
    "the kinematical limit for the total number charged and neutral particles is @xmath6=56 .",
    "the data for @xmath722 and for @xmath831 are presented in this work .",
    "collective effects can occur in the events with the multiplicity by several times higher than the average one : the large fluctuations of charged and neutral pion numbers , as result of formation pion condensate , formation of jets with identical pions , the so - called bose - einstein multiparticle effect , formation of ring events as result gluon hadronization , which are emitted out by partons in the nuclear environment ( cherenkov radiation analog ) and others .",
    "the svd-2 data allows one to check and develop various models of multiparticle production with @xmath9 .",
    "m. i. gorenstein and v. v. begun @xcite @xcite have shown that at the approach of the pion system to bose - einstein condensate conditions ( bec ) the neutral pion number fluctuations are increasing in accordance with the model based on quantum statistics .",
    "these fluctuations can be detected by the scaled variance , @xmath10 , which is defined as the ratio of variance d for neutral pion number distribution @xmath11 and average @xmath12 ,    @xmath13 .",
    "the value of @xmath10 rising with increasing of the total particle number , @xmath1 , depends on temperature and energy density of pion system .",
    "a part of e-190 data is used in this paper to search for pion number fluctuations .",
    "numbers of charged particles , @xmath4 , and photons , @xmath14 , in each event are detected .",
    "these values are corrected on the setup acceptance and reconstruction efficiency by means of modeling .",
    "simulation has allowed getting the neutral pion number , @xmath0 , in each event also .",
    "numbers of events , @xmath15 , are measured here with corrections on various losses . for the analysis of the data at different @xmath6 relative values of @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "thus @xmath18 is changed in the range of 0@xmath191 and the sum of all @xmath20 is equal to 1 for each @xmath6 ( normalization condition ) . the fig .",
    "1 qualitatively illustrates the behaviour of value @xmath20 for three cases : a ) the generation of events with pythia5.6 program , b ) the pion system in which some pions drop out into condensate , c ) all pions are in the bec condition .",
    "each distribution is characterized by average , @xmath21 , and by standard deviation , @xmath22 for a gaussian fit .",
    "distributions @xmath20 for normalized multiplicity of neutral pions in qcd model and when the system approaches to bec . ]",
    "calorimeter dega at svd-2 setup detects the events with photons from neutral pions decay .",
    "registration of all @xmath23 in the event is not possible because of limited dega aperture and the threshold on photon detection energy .",
    "but @xmath23 reconstruction efficiency can be estimated by means of simulation .",
    "using pythia5.6 code @xmath24 events ( mc ) are simulated for pp@xmath25x inelastic interactions at 50 gev .",
    "only the events with @xmath264 are analyzed .",
    "the photon detection efficiency is assumed to be equal to 1 if photon hits dega and its energy is greater than 100 mev .",
    "practically all photons are the product of @xmath23 decays ( 95% ) , 37% of them give two gammas signal in dega and 18% of @xmath23 result in one photon signal . fig .",
    "2 shows the dependence of pion number in event , @xmath0 , on number of photons in dega , @xmath14 .",
    "it is clear that there is no unique connection between @xmath14 and @xmath0 .",
    "instead each @xmath14 is associated with some number of @xmath0 and there is a linear correlation between average @xmath27 and @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "so relation between the number of events @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be found from this analysis . in fig .",
    "2c multiplicity distributions for pions and photons in dega are presented .",
    "the form of these distributions is similar except the area of small multiplicity .",
    "a ) the dependence of the pions number in mc events on photons number detected in dega , + b ) @xmath27 and @xmath14 correlation ]    values n and r are calculated for mc events",
    ". then the dependence of r versus n has been fitted with gaussian . in fig .",
    "3a the fitted parameters @xmath21 and @xmath30 on @xmath6 are presented , where @xmath1 for @xmath23 and @xmath31 for photons .",
    "standard deviations , @xmath22 of gaussians , are presented in fig .",
    "3b too . the normalized dispersion , @xmath10=@xmath32 @xmath33 is shown in fig .",
    "the value @xmath10 decreases for photons , but remains near the constant for pions in the full area of @xmath6 changes .",
    "the calorimeter dega contains 42x32=1344 elements from lead glass blocks with pm .",
    "the calibration of dega is carried out with irradiation of each element center by 15 gev electron beam . almost all ( 98% ) energy of electromagnetic shower from the photon is located in the cell ( 3@xmath343 ) elements .",
    "photon reconstruction consists in the searching of ( 3@xmath343 ) signal clusters and analyzing them with criteria for photon .",
    "the present work comprises @xmath35 events of pp interaction .",
    "the analysis of the electromagnetic showers has led to the following results : average photon number in the event is @xmath36=3.0 ( fig .",
    "4 ) , their average energy is @xmath37=2.8 gev ( fig .",
    "5b ) , the minimum energy of photon detection is equal to 100 mev .    for the charged tracks reconstruction the data only from vd have been used . because of various losses the corrections of charged particle number are essential for measurements of pion fluctuations .",
    "the correction for the setup acceptance and the particle reconstruction efficiency is made by means of the apparatus performance simulation .",
    "the obtained weights have shown the contribution of events with a different true number of charged tracks into the event sample with the reconstructed multiplicity .",
    "the details of this procedure are presented in @xcite.in the present work the number of events with measured @xmath4 is distributed on event samples with restored value @xmath4 according to these weights .",
    "topological cross sections for pp - interactions at 50 gev were measured in experiment with mirabelle bubble chamber @xcite .",
    "taking into account that data topological cross sections for @xmath38 had been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the present data are obtained with suppression of small charged multiplicity events ( @xmath39 ) with trigger conditions .",
    "therefore the charged multiplicity distribution has been corrected to lead to the distribution received in @xcite @xcite .",
    "distributions of corrected @xmath4 , @xmath14 and @xmath31 . ]    fig .",
    "5 shows charged multiplicity distributions after corrections .",
    "it is necessary to stress that the change of the event number for @xmath4 after introduction of corrections also leads to the change of the event number for @xmath14 .",
    "so , the distribution for @xmath14 in fig .",
    "5 differs from the similar distribution in fig .",
    "4a for observable event numbers .",
    "thus we have corrected event numbers @xmath28 . then two - dimensional @xmath40 distributions for mc events ( see fig .",
    "2 ) are used to recover event numbers @xmath29 .",
    "we have introduced notations i=@xmath14 , j=@xmath0 and @xmath41 . for each @xmath4 matrix of coefficients",
    "@xmath42 is calculated , where @xmath43 .",
    "event number @xmath28 is decomposed in sums of events with various @xmath0 , @xmath44 at @xmath4=const .",
    "normalization condition @xmath45=1 is satisfied .",
    "resulting sum @xmath46 at @xmath4=fix is the analog of event number @xmath28 , but for pions .",
    "the simulation by pythia5.6 allows to obtain @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 only because of limitation of the mc events statistics .",
    "regularities of factors @xmath47 are used to continue them to @xmath50 and @xmath51 region .",
    "6a illustrates the dependence of @xmath47 factors on @xmath0 for various @xmath14 and @xmath4 .",
    "the form of these distributions slightly depends on @xmath14 and @xmath4 , but their average @xmath27 increases with @xmath14 .",
    "the dependence of the average @xmath27 and standard deviation ( rms ) on @xmath14 are shown in fig .",
    "6b . after fitting it by linear dependence the coefficients @xmath47 for @xmath5210 and @xmath5314",
    "are calculated and the full sample of @xmath54 is obtained , which is used then to determine pion fluctuation .        as mention before we have used scaled variables @xmath18 and @xmath20 ( see introduction ) : @xmath16 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "function @xmath57 are shown in fig . 7 for every @xmath58 .",
    "all distributions are fitted with gaussian function .",
    "the dependence of the fitting parameters is presented in fig .",
    "the data in the intervals ( 26 , 27 , 28 ) and ( 29 , 30 , 31 ) are combined due to small statistics .",
    "one can see that the measured average @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "8 ) coincide with the same values for the neutral pions from mc events at @xmath312 . in the gluon dominance model ( mgd ) @xcite neutral pions",
    "average dependence on @xmath6 has been received by analytical way .",
    "this dependence is also presented in fig . 8 and illustrates quite good agreement with the experimental data at @xmath314 .",
    "the average @xmath30 is also shown .",
    "the measured standard deviations , @xmath22 ( gaussian ) , ( fig .",
    "8b ) have shown the qualitative agreement with mc model only for @xmath5922 .",
    "the measured values @xmath22 increase at higher @xmath6 .",
    "the theoretical prediction of scaled variance @xmath10 behavior ( in our case @xmath60 ) is given in @xcite .",
    "the analysis has been done for three energy densities of the pion system at the approach to the bose - einstein condensate condition ( pion condensate ) ( fig .",
    "9 ) . our experimental data ( fig .",
    "9b ) have confirmed assumption on the bec formation in pion system at @xmath322 in pp - interactions at 50 gev .",
    "measurements of the charged and neutral pions number in the events with high multiplicity in pp - interactions at 50 gev ( experiment serp--190 , svd-2 setup ) together with mc analysis led to the following results :    * the average number of neutral pions in the event is proportional to the photons number detected in dega calorimeter that allows one to extract pion number fluctuations from photon number fluctuations .",
    "* it is convenient to present data in the scaled form : @xmath16 and @xmath55 with interval @xmath18 is equal to 0@xmath191 . * the corrections for limited aperture vd ,",
    "trigger action and efficiency of data processing system have been introduced to the data . *",
    "the function @xmath57 is fitted with gaussian function and values @xmath21 , @xmath22 and scaled variance @xmath2 are derived .",
    "they have shown the qualitative agreement with the same values received for pythia5.6 code at @xmath5922 . * pion number fluctuations increase at @xmath322 , that indicates approaching to pion condensate conditions for the high multiplicity pion system according to gce , ce , mce models @xcite @xcite . *",
