    "+    over the last decade , the spin of individual electrons in semiconductor nanostructures has been intensively studied in relation to spin - based quantum computing schemes.@xcite attaining an almost full control over the spin of individual electrons in qds opens the possibility to study single spin dynamics in a solid state environment in the presence of relaxation and decoherence .",
    "although lateral qds have been most successfully used until now to demonstrate spin coherence and usability for quantum computing,@xcite novel quantum systems have emerged in recent years , providing a number of new ways to implement the basic ideas of quantum computing.@xcite among such systems are the qds formed inside semiconductor nanowires.@xcite    rapid progress in gaas nanostructures started once few - electron qds became available ( for a review , see e.g. , ref . ) , which opened the door to control the number of electrons in a single qd down to one in vertical@xcite and lateral@xcite dots , as well as in double qds.@xcite further important experimental progress came with the advent of charge sensors which , quite remarkably , enabled the measurement of the relaxation time of one single spin.@xcite the longest spin relaxation times in single gaas qds extend up to several seconds@xcite and were measured in lateral dots at relatively small magnetic fields ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the spin decoherence time in gaas was measured also in double qds by studying the hyperfine - induced mixing of singlet and triplet states.@xcite in the same set - up , a universal entanglement operation was implemented,@xcite enabling a square - root - of - swap operation@xcite between two spin-1/2 qubits on a time scale of 180 ps .",
    "resonant and coherent manipulation of a single spin-1/2 has recently been implemented in a gaas double qd , making use of electron spin resonance ( esr)@xcite as well as electric dipole induced spin resonance ( edsr)@xcite techniques .",
    "resonant but incoherent ( hyperfine - mediated ) spin manipulation in double dots was also recently demonstrated .",
    "@xcite    the use of different semiconductors , other than gaas , has since long been pursuit with the goal to create nanostructures with novel properties .",
    "particular examples are inas and inp nanowires , where both gate defined and barrier defined qds could be fabricated.@xcite the advantage of these materials is that both optical and transport measurements can be carried out on the same type of structure .",
    "the number of electrons can equally well be controlled down to one electron per dot,@xcite which shows that qds created in nanowires can serve as alternative candidates for spin - qubits .",
    "one particular difference between gaas and inas semiconductors is the strength of the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , which is much larger for the latter material .",
    "this fact , however , is a double - edge sword ; on one hand it opens up the possibility to efficiently manipulate the electron spin with _ electric _ fields only,@xcite while on the other hand it implies stronger coupling of the spin to charge environments , like phonons , particle - hole excitations , gate voltage fluctuation , etc .",
    "however , due to the quasi-1d structure of the nanowires , the spin relaxation times due to phonons and soi turn out to be longer than one might expect from qds created in inas bulk material .",
    "indeed , the time scales obtained in this work are on the order of microseconds to milliseconds for sufficiently large zeeman splittings . at the same time , the relaxation rate exhibits peaks as a function of a static applied magnetic field due to the quantization of the phonon spectrum . the long relaxation time and the presence of strong soi permits then an efficient control of coherent spin states by making use of edsr .",
    "@xcite one of the main ingredients in the spin - qubit scheme@xcite is the electrical control of two - qubit gates to generate entanglement .",
    "while the original proposal involved only local interactions between neighboring spins , it is desirable to couple spins directly over large distances , since this produces a better threshold for fault tolerant quantum computation.@xcite a solution to this problem was first proposed in ref . and",
    "involves optical cavities whose photon modes mediate interaction between distant spins .",
    "the coupling of the spin to optical cavities in semiconductors was also the subject of some recent experiments.@xcite    very recently , 1d electromagnetic cavities ( or transmission lines ) were shown to be very suitable for reaching the strong coupling regime between superconducting qubits and photons.@xcite theoretical extension to qds were proposed subsequently , including charge and spin qubits.@xcite the direct coupling of the spin to the cavity modes via the magnetic dipole transitions is usually weak and one has to use electric dipole transitions together with correlations between spin and charge degrees of freedom in order to obtain a strong effective coupling .",
    "this can be achieved in several ways , e.g. by making use of the pauli exclusion principle and coulomb repulsion , @xcite or of raman transitions.@xcite    here we propose another mechanism to achieve long - distance coupling between spins inside a cavity , namely via soi which leads to an effective coupling of spin to the electric field component of the cavity photon , and thus eventually to a coupling between distant spins mediated by this photon . in order to reach a sizable coupling strength , it is desirable to use nanostructures with large soi such as inas qds .",
    "two such proposed configurations , which define the two model systems to be studied in this paper , are sketched in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] a and b. they consist of nanowire qds embedded in a transmission line . in particular , in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a a nanowire positioned _ parallel _ to the transmission line axis is shown . in this case , the qds are realized by confining the electrons in the longitudinal direction ( i.e. along the nanowire axis ) much stronger than in the transverse one .",
    "this corresponds to a nanowire with a large diameter , on the order of @xmath1 .",
    "such longitudinal confinement can be achieved by applying metallic gates or by using other materials as barriers ( inp for example , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in brown ) which have a larger band gap than the host material such as e.g. inas.@xcite in fig [ fig1]b a small - diameter ( @xmath2 ) inas nanowire is shown , being positioned perpendicularly to the transmission line and containg qds that are elongated along the nanowire .",
    "that means that in this case we assume that the electronic confinement along the nanowire is much weaker than in the transverse direction .",
    "then , to a very good approximation , the electrons can be considered as behaving one - dimensionally , which will allow us to treat the soi exactly , while this is not possible for the configuration fig .",
    "however , in order to prevent a current flow , the nanowire and the transmission line need to be separated by some insulating coating material , obtained , for example , by atomic layer deposition .",
    "the goal of our work is now to analyze these configurations in detail and , in the first part of the paper , to derive an effective spin - spin coupling hamiltonian . in the second part",
    ", we study the spin decay in this system , induced by phonons and soi , and calculate explicitly the spin relaxation and decoherence times due to this mechanism .",
    "we will show that these times are much longer than the switching times needed to manipulate and couple the spins coherently .",
    "thus , our findings provide theoretical evidence that nanowire qds embedded into transmission lines are promising candidates for spin - qubits with tunable long - range coupling .",
    "this scheme also opens the door to hybrid configurations where qubits of different nature ( e.g. superconducting and spin qubits ) can be coupled via the transmission line .",

    "v we analyze the opposite case , when the electron is strongly confined in the transverse direction of the nanowire . in sec .",
    "vi we provide some numerical estimates for the strengths of the spin - photon and spin - spin couplings for both cases . then , in sec .",
    "vii we give a brief description of the manipulation of the spins by electric fields . in sec .",
    "viii we study the spin decay and provide a detailed description of the relaxation of the spin via soi and acoustic phonons .",
    "some technical details of the phonon analysis are deferred to app .",

    "<S> we study theoretically electron spins in nanowire quantum dots placed inside a transmission line resonator . because of the spin - orbit interaction , the spins couple to the electric component of the resonator electromagnetic field and enable coherent manipulation , storage , and read - out of quantum information in an all - electrical fashion . </S>",
    "<S> coupling between distant quantum - dot spins , in one and the same or different nanowires , can be efficiently performed via the resonator mode either in real time or through virtual processes . for the latter case </S>",
    "<S> we derive an effective spin - entangling interaction and suggest means to turn it on and off . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both transverse and longitudinal types of nanowire quantum - dots and compare their manipulation timescales against the spin relaxation times . </S>",
    "<S> for this , we evaluate the rates for spin relaxation induced by the nanowire vibrations ( phonons ) and show that , as a result of phonon confinement in the nanowire , this rate is a strongly varying function of the spin operation frequency and thus can be drastically reduced compared to lateral quantum dots in gaas . our scheme is a step forward to the formation of hybrid structures where qubits of different nature can be integrated in a single device . </S>"
