    "the widely accepted interpretation of the phenomenology of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) is that the observable effects are due to the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistically expanding fireball ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) . in the last two years , afterglows of grbs have been discovered in x - ray ( @xcite ) , optical ( @xcite ) and radio ( @xcite ) wavelength .",
    "afterglow observations lead to the confirmation of the cosmological origin of the bursts through the detection of redshifted optical absorption lines ( e.g. @xcite ) , and confirmed ( @xcite ) standard model predictions ( @xcite ) of afterglow that results from the collision of the expanding fireball with surrounding medium .    in fireball models of grbs",
    "the energy released by an explosion is converted to kinetic energy of a thin baryonic shell expanding at an ultra - relativistic speed . after producing the grb , the shell impacts on surrounding gas , driving an ultra - relativistic shock into the ambient medium .",
    "after a short transition phase , the expanding blast wave approaches a self - similar behavior ( @xcite ) .",
    "the long term afterglow is produced by the expanding shock that propagates into the surrounding gas . this shock continuously heats fresh gas and accelerates relativistic electrons to a power - law energy distribution , which produces the observed radiation through synchrotron emission .",
    "the simplest fireball afterglow model therefore depends on five model parameters : the explosion energy @xmath15 , the ambient density @xmath16 , the spectral index of the electron energy distribution @xmath5 , and the fractions @xmath3 and @xmath17 of shock thermal energy carried by electrons and magnetic field respectively .",
    "the model may be further elaborated by allowing inhomogeneous density distribution and deviations from spherical symmetry ( @xcite ) .    despite the fact that afterglow observations are in general consistent with fireball model predictions , observations do not allow , in almost all cases , the determination of basic fireball parameters .",
    "in particular , the fireball energy , and hence the efficiency with which this energy is converted to @xmath0-ray radiation , can be reliably determined only in one case , namely that of grb 970508 , for which wide spectral coverage is available over hundreds of days ( @xcite ) . for all other cases ,",
    "energy estimates rely on the observed @xmath0-ray fluence ( which dominates the fluence at all other wave - bands ) .",
    "such energy estimates are , however , subject to large uncertainties .    during @xmath0-ray emission",
    "the fireball expands with a large lorentz factor , @xmath18 , and a distant observer receives radiation from a conical section of the fireball of opening angle @xmath19 around the line of sight .",
    "observed @xmath0-ray fluence provides therefore the @xmath0-ray energy per unit solid angle @xmath20 emitted by a conical section of the fireball of opening angle @xmath19 .",
    "thus , if the fireball is a jet of opening angle @xmath21 , its total @xmath0-ray energy would be smaller by a factor @xmath22 compared to that inferred assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "the total @xmath0-ray energy emitted may differ significantly from that obtained assuming spherical symmetry also for @xmath23 , if @xmath20 is strongly dependent on the angle @xmath24 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "it has therefore been suggested ( @xcite ) that the most energetic bursts ( i.e. those with highest isotropic @xmath0-ray energy ) may not represent much higher energy release from the source , but rather cases in which our line of sight happens to coincide with a small patch on the fireball emitting surface which is much brighter than average .",
    "energy estimates based on @xmath0-ray fluence are furthermore uncertain even in the case of spherical symmetry , since it is possible that only a small fraction of fireball energy is converted to @xmath0-ray radiation .",
    "it is generally argued , for example , that if @xmath0-ray emission is due to internal shocks within the fireball , then only a small fraction , @xmath25 , of fireball energy is converted to @xmath0-rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "the low efficiency obtained in these analyses is not due to low electron energy fraction ( equipartition , @xmath4 , is assumed ) , but rather due to the low efficiency of converting kinetic energy to thermal energy in the models analyzed , and due to the fact that not all of the radiation is emitted in the observed @xmath0-ray band . for @xmath3 values below equipartition",
    ", the efficiency would be even lower .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to address the open questions associated with grb energy and @xmath0-ray production efficiency .",
    "we show that significant progress can be made in inferring basic fireball parameters if , instead of analyzing individual burst data , the ensemble of grb afterglow observations is analyzed under the hypothesis that the values of parameters which are determined by the micro - physics of the relativistic shock , e.g. @xmath5 and @xmath3 , are universal .",
    "we first show in  2.1 that afterglow observations provide strong support to the hypothesis that the spectral index of the electron energy distribution is universal , @xmath26 .",
    "we then show in  2.2 that , adopting a universal @xmath5 value , a single x - ray afterglow flux measurement at time @xmath27 provides a robust estimate of the total energy per unit solid angle carried by fireball electrons , @xmath28 , over a conical section of the fireball of opening angle @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the fireball expansion lorentz factor ( for x - ray observations on day time scale , @xmath31 ) .",
    "we then show in  2.3 that afterglow observations also imply a universal value close to equipartition for the electron energy fraction , @xmath4 .",
    "thus , x - ray afterglow flux measurement also provides a robust estimate of the total fireball energy per unit solid angle , @xmath32 . applying these ideas we provide in  2 constraints on fireball energy for all grbs with x - ray afterglow data .",
    "the implications of our results are discussed in  3 .",
    "for a power - law electron energy distribution , @xmath1 , the spectrum of synchrotron emission is @xmath33 at frequencies where emission is dominated by electrons for which the synchrotron cooling time is larger than the source expansion time , and @xmath34 at higher frequencies , where electron synchrotron cooling time is shorter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , observed afterglow spectra do not in general allow an accurate determination of @xmath5 , since optical spectra may be affected by extinction and since x - ray data typically does not allow accurate determination of x - ray photon spectral indices .",
    "accurate determination of @xmath5 is possible , nevertheless , in the case of grb  970508 , where radio , optical and x - ray spectral data are available ; these data imply @xmath35 ( @xcite ) , and in the case of grb  990510 , where bvri optical data determine @xmath36 ( @xcite ) .    within the framework of the fireball model , the afterglow flux at high frequency exhibits a power - law decay in time , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is related to the electron index @xmath5 . here too , accurate determination of @xmath5 is generally not possible based on measurements of @xmath38 , since the relation between @xmath38 and @xmath5 depends on the spatial distribution of ambient density and on the angular distribution of fireball parameters ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in several cases the time dependence of optical flux strongly suggests a universal value @xmath26 .",
    "the steepening of optical flux decay in grb  990510 afterglow ( @xcite ) and the fast decline of optical flux for grb  980519 , @xmath39 , and grb  980326 , @xmath40 , ( @xcite ) is most naturally explained ( @xcite,1999,@xcite ) by the fireball being initially a collimated jet . in this case",
    "steepening takes place once sideways expansion of the jet becomes important , at which stage the the temporal power - law flux decay index is @xmath41 .",
    "the observed values of @xmath38 are consistent therefore with @xmath26 .",
    "we present here additional evidence for a universal @xmath26 value . in table 1 the effective photon spectral index determined by x - ray and optical afterglow fluxes , @xmath42 , is shown for all cases where both x - ray and optical afterglow fluxes are available .",
    "the values of @xmath43 are in the range of 0.6 to 1.1 .",
    "this is the range expected for a power - law electron energy distribution with @xmath44 .",
    "for such a distribution @xmath45 is obtained for the case where the frequency @xmath46 , at which emission is dominated by electrons with synchrotron cooling time comparable to the fireball expansion time , is below the optical band @xmath47 , @xmath48 is obtained for @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "we note that an alternative model for the fast , @xmath52 , optical flux decline of grb  980519 has been suggested ( @xcite ) , in which the afterglow is produced by a spherical fireball expanding into a pre - burst massive star wind , where @xmath53 .",
    "since for @xmath26 expansion into a wind gives an optical flux decline which is not significantly steeper than that obtained for expansion into homogeneous density ( e.g. @xcite ) , the wind model for grb  980519 invokes a steep electron index @xmath54 to account for the fast decline ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that for such a steep electron index the model x - ray flux is @xmath55 times lower than the measured flux at @xmath56  d while for the wind model parameters @xmath57  hz . ] .      for clarity ,",
    "we first discuss in this section spherical fireballs of energy @xmath15 expanding into uniform ambient density @xmath16 .",
    "we then generalize the discussion to the case where spherical symmetry and homogeneity are not assumed . since the value of @xmath5 in the cases where it is best determined by observations is @xmath44 , we present numeric results for @xmath44 and comment on the sensitivity of the results to changes in @xmath5 value .    adopting the hypothesis that the electron spectral index value is universal , @xmath26 , the fact that @xmath58 in all cases ( see table 1 ) implies that @xmath59 in all cases ( note that extinction in the host galaxy can only reduce the observed value of @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is indeed expected , since on time scale of a day , the time scale over which x - ray afterglow is observed , @xmath46 is typically expected to be well bellow the x - ray band .",
    "the ( fireball rest frame ) lorentz factor @xmath60 of electrons for which the synchrotron cooling time is comparable to the ( rest frame ) adiabatic cooling time is determined by @xmath61 . here , @xmath30 is the shocked plasma lorentz factor , related to observed time by @xmath62 ( @xcite ) , and the adiabatic cooling time is @xmath63 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic ( observed ) frequency of synchrotron photons emitted by such electrons , @xmath64 , is @xmath65 where @xmath66  erg , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69  d. in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu_c ] ) we have used the self - similar relation between fireball lorentz factor and radius , @xmath70 ( @xcite ) , and the relation @xmath71 between fireball radius and observed time ( @xcite ) .",
    "the synchrotron peak flux @xmath72 in the fireball model under consideration is time independent , @xmath73 and the peak frequency @xmath74 decreases with time , @xmath75 here , @xmath76 are numeric constants , and @xmath77 is the burst luminosity distance . in what follows we use the analytic results of gruzinov & waxman ( 1999 ) for the values of the numeric constants , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "similar values have been obtained by numerical ( @xcite ) and approximate analytic ( @xcite ) calculations .",
    "order unity differences between the various analyses reflect different detailed model assumptions and degree of accuracy of the approximations .",
    "note , that the exact value of @xmath80 depends on the detailed shape of the electron distribution function ( @xmath81 is insensitive to such details , @xcite ) .",
    "although we have strong evidence that at high energy this distribution is a power - law , it may not be a pure power - law at low energy , which would affect the value of @xmath80 .",
    "however , the relation ( [ eq : nu_m ] ) would still hold for all grbs as long as the distribution function is universal .    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nu_c][eq : nu_m ] ) , the fireball electron energy , @xmath82 , is related to the observed flux @xmath83 at time @xmath27 and frequency @xmath84 , @xmath85 , as @xmath86 where @xmath87 here , we have defined @xmath88 so that @xmath89 .",
    "( [ eq : e_e ] ) implies that a measurement of the flux @xmath90 at a frequency above the cooling frequency provides a robust estimate of the fireball electron energy .",
    "the energy estimate is independent of the ambient density @xmath16 and nearly independent of @xmath17 , @xmath91 with @xmath92 ( e.g. @xmath93 for p=2.2 ) . since @xmath92 ,",
    "the value of @xmath94 is similar for all grbs .",
    "it also implies that changing the value of @xmath5 would affect the energy estimate of all bursts in a similar way . for typical parameters , @xmath95 , @xmath96  cm , @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    ", we have @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 for @xmath44 and @xmath101 for @xmath102 .",
    "note that changing @xmath44 to @xmath102 would increase the energy estimate by less than a factor of @xmath103 , since the value of @xmath80 is higher for larger @xmath5 .",
    "for pure power - law electron distribution , @xmath104 and the energy obtained assuming @xmath102 is larger than that obtained assuming @xmath44 by a factor of @xmath105 .",
    "a few comments should be made here regarding the uniform density and spherical symmetry assumptions . since the energy estimate ( [ eq : e_e ] )",
    "is independent of @xmath16 , it holds not only for the case of homogeneous density , but also to models with variable density , e.g. for wind models in which @xmath53 .",
    "the values of the constants @xmath106 would of course differ , by order unity factors , from those used here .",
    "however , the relation ( [ eq : e_e ] ) should still hold and the energy estimate would not be significantly affected as @xmath106 would not be significantly modified .",
    "we have so far assumed spherical symmetry .",
    "since the fireball expands at relativistic speed , a distant observer receives radiation from a conical section of the fireball with opening angle @xmath107 around the line of sight .",
    "thus , the energy @xmath15 in the discussion above should be understood as the energy that the fireball would have carried had it been spherically symmetric .",
    "in particular , eq . ( [ eq : e_e ] ) determines the fireball energy per unit solid angle @xmath108 , within the observable cone of opening angle @xmath109 .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath30 , @xmath110 is only weakly dependent on fireball parameters .",
    "thus , x - ray observations on @xmath111  d time scale provide information on a conical section of the fireball of opening angle @xmath7 ( this holds also for the wind case , @xcite ) .",
    "note , that since observed @xmath0-rays are emitted at a stage the fireball is highly relativistic , @xmath112 , @xmath0-ray observations provide information on a much smaller section of the fireball , @xmath113 .",
    "table 2 compares observed grb @xmath0-ray energy per unit solid angle with fireball electron energy per unit solid angle derived from x - ray afterglow flux using eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_e ] ) .",
    "results are given for all bursts with published @xmath0-ray fluence and x - ray afterglow flux ( note , that for all but one of the bepposax triggered grbs which were observed with the nfi , x - ray afterglow has been detected ; we exclude grb  980425 from the analysis , since for this bursts it is not clear whether or not x - ray afterglow was detected , @xcite ) .",
    "we present our results in terms of @xmath114 , which is the total fireball energy under the assumption of electron energy equipartition , @xmath4 .",
    "the results are also shown in fig .",
    "we have included in the table and figure bursts for which optical data is not available . for such bursts , the effective spectral index @xmath43 can not be determined , and therefore it can not be directly demonstrated from observations that @xmath115 , and hence that eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_e ] ) applies .",
    "however , it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu_c ] ) that the condition @xmath115 is likely to be satisfied on a day time scale .",
    "in addition , the distribution of grb @xmath0-ray and total energy ratios we infer for bursts without optical counterpart is similar to that of bursts with optical counterpart , indicating that indeed the condition @xmath115 is satisfied . to determine the absolute energy of grbs for which the redshift is unknown , we have assumed grb redshift of @xmath116 , since , based on measured grb redshifts , most detected",
    "grbs are expected to occur at the redshift range of 1 to 2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "several characteristics of afterglow observations imply that the electron energy fraction @xmath3 is close to equipartition . for grb  970508",
    "afterglow data is detailed enough to determine @xmath117 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn for grb  971214 .",

    "( [ eq : f_m ] ) and ( [ eq : nu_m ] ) this implies , for grb  971214 redshift @xmath121 ( @xcite ) , @xmath122 .",
    "thus , a value close to equipartition is implied by grb  971214 observations ( @xcite suggest a different interpretation of the grb  971214 data , which also requires @xmath123 ) . for most other bursts , afterglow observations",
    "are not sufficient for determining the value of @xmath3 .",
    "however , @xmath4 is consistent with all afterglow data , and is indeed commonly used in afterglow models attempting to account for observations .",
    "this is consistent with our hypothesis of universal @xmath3 value close to equipartition .",
    "additional support for this hypothesis is provided by the following argument .",
    "granat / sigma observations of grb  920723 ( @xcite ) and batse observation of grb  980923 ( @xcite ) show a continuous transition from grb to afterglow phase in the hard x - ray range .",
    "it has also been shown for several bepposax bursts that the 210  kev flux at the end of the grb phase , on time scale of tens of seconds , is close to that obtained by extrapolating backward in time the x - ray afterglow flux ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the late grb flux is in fact dominated by afterglow emission , i.e. by synchrotron emission from the shock driven into the ambient medium ( see also @xcite ) . on minute time scale , the emission peaks at @xmath124  kev energies ( @xcite ) , implying @xmath125  hz at this time ( note that this value is consistent with the @xmath74 values inferred at later time for grb  970508 and grb  971214 ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu_m ] ) , we find that this in turn implies @xmath126 .",
    "thus , a value of @xmath3 well below equipartition , @xmath127 , would require @xmath128 , inconsistent with our conclusion that @xmath129 ( see fig .",
    "we have shown that afterglow observations strongly suggest that the energy distribution of shock accelerated electrons is universal , given at high energy by a power - law @xmath1 with @xmath2 (  2.1 ) , and that the energy fraction carried by electrons is also universal and close to equipartition , @xmath4 (  2.3 ) . adopting the hypothesis that the value of @xmath5 is universal and close to 2 , @xmath2 , we showed (  2.2 ) that a single measurement at time @xmath27 of x - ray afterglow flux provides , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_e ] ) , a robust estimate of the fireball electron energy per unit solid angle , @xmath130 , over a conical section of the fireball of opening angle @xmath107 , where @xmath131 is the fireball lorentz factor . on day time scale @xmath31",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) ] , and x - ray flux therefore provides a robust estimate of @xmath130 over an opening angle @xmath7 . adopting the hypothesis that @xmath3 is close to equipartition",
    ", the x - ray flux provides also a robust estimate of the total fireball energy per unit solid angle , @xmath6 , over an opening angle @xmath7 .",
    "we emphasize here that the total ( or electron ) fireball energy estimates are not based on the total x - ray fluence .",
    "the x - ray fluence is dominated by the early time , @xmath132  s , emission . since at this time the fireball lorentz factor is high , @xmath18 ,",
    "the total x - ray fluence provides information only on a small section of the fireball , @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , using the x - ray fluence to derive constraints on fireball parameters using afterglow models is complicated since on @xmath124  s time scale the fireball is not in the self - similar expansion stage for which afterglow models apply , since grb emission on this time scale is important and it is difficult to separate afterglow and main grb contributions , and since the x - ray afterglow flux is not observed in the time interval of @xmath134  s to @xmath135  d , which implies that the total fluence depends strongly on the interpolation of x - ray flux over the time interval in which it is not measured .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that while the x - ray flux is independent of the ambient density into which the fireball expands and very weakly dependent on the magnetic field energy fraction [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_e ] ) ] , the optical flux detected on a time scale of a day is sensitive to both parameters , since the cooling frequency is close to the optical band on this time scale [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu_c ] ) ] .",
    "moreover , the optical flux may be significantly affected by extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "thus , while the observed x - ray flux provides mainly information on intrinsic fireball parameters , the optical flux depends strongly on the fireball environment .",
    "our results for @xmath6 are presented in table 2 and in fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath0-ray energy per unit solid angle , @xmath20 , is plotted as a function of fireball energy per unit solid angle , @xmath6 .",
    "several conclusion may be drawn based on the table and figure :    1 .",
    "fireball energies of observed grbs are in the range of @xmath8 to @xmath9  erg .",
    "2 .   @xmath20 and @xmath6 are strongly correlated , with @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the most energetic bursts ( i.e. those with highest isotropic @xmath0-ray energy ) represent much higher energy release from the sources .",
    "3 .   our results are inconsistent with models in which grb @xmath0-ray emission is produced by internal shocks with low efficiency ( @xcite ) , @xmath136 for electron energy equipartition @xmath4 ( and still lower efficiency for lower electron energy fraction ) .",
    "however , we believe this contradiction should not be considered strong evidence against internal shock models , since the low efficiency obtained in the analyses reflects mainly the underlying assumptions of the models regarding the variability of the wind produced by the source",
    ". in particular , if the typical ratio of lorentz factors of adjacent fireball wind shells is large , rather than being of order unity as commonly assumed , the internal shock efficiency may be close to unity .",
    "the strong correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath6 , and in particular the fact that values @xmath137 are not obtained , implies that if fireballs are jets of finite opening angle @xmath24 , then @xmath24 should satisfy @xmath12 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for @xmath138 significant sideways expansion of the jet would occur well before x - ray afterglow observations , during which @xmath31 , leading to @xmath137 .",
    "our conclusion is similar to that obtained by piro _",
    "( 1999 ) based on a different argument ( piro _ et al . _",
    "rely on analysis of the relation between x - ray afterglow spectral and temporal characteristics ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath10 values larger than unity , @xmath139 , are obtained for @xmath140  erg , may suggest that the electron energy fraction in these cases is somewhat below equipartition ( @xmath141 can not be ruled out by our analysis ) , and/or that the fireball is a jet of opening angle @xmath142 , in which case some reduction of energy per solid angle at the x - ray observation time would be detectable .",
    "note , that grb  990123 and grb  980519 , for which evidence for a jet - like fireball exists and which are included in our analysis , are indeed in the group for which @xmath139 . 6 .   for low energy , @xmath143  erg , bursts we find @xmath144 .",

    "1 ) .    our analysis allows to determine the total fireball energy per unit solid angle averaged over an angle @xmath7 .",
    "a determination of the total energy emitted from the source requires knowledge of the fireball opening angle .",
    "if typical opening angles are @xmath7 , an angle suggested by the observed breaks in optical light curves and consistent with our results , the total energy emitted by the underlying grb sources is in the range of @xmath13  erg to @xmath14  erg .",

    "<S> we show that @xmath0-ray burst ( grb ) afterglow observations strongly suggest , within the fireball model framework , that radiating electrons are shock accelerated to a power - law energy distribution , @xmath1 , with universal index @xmath2 , and that the fraction of shock energy carried by electrons , @xmath3 , is universal and close to equipartition , @xmath4 . for universal @xmath5 and @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , a single measurement of the x - ray afterglow flux on the time scale of a day provides a robust estimate of the fireball energy per unit solid angle , @xmath6 , averaged over a conical section of the fireball of opening angle @xmath7 .    applying our analysis to bepposax afterglow data we find that : ( i ) fireball energies are in the range of @xmath8 to @xmath9  erg ; ( ii ) the ratio of observed @xmath0-ray to total fireball energy per unit solid angle , @xmath10 , is of order unity , satisfying @xmath11 ; ( iii ) if fireballs are jet like , their opening angle should satisfy @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that if typical opening angles are @xmath7 , a value consistent with our analysis , the total energy associated with a grb event is in the range of @xmath13  erg to @xmath14  erg .    </S>"
