    "the nonperturbative quantum geometry program also known as  loop quantum gravity \" , has met recently with substantial success in obtaining a calculation of the statistical mechanical entropy of a non - rotating black hole that accounts for its phenomenological identification with @xmath0 @xcite . in so doing it was necessary to introduce a complete classical hamiltonian treatment of black holes .",
    "this was accomplished by generalizing and properly defining the sector of the theory that is going to be treated .",
    "this work was guided by the need to start with a well defined action that would be differentiable in the sector under consideration .",
    "this lead those authors to the specialization of the notion of trapping horizons @xcite of hayward s to that of ` isolated horizons ' .",
    "physically the idea is to represent  horizons in internal equilibrium and decoupled from what is outside \" .",
    "the zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics refer to equilibrium situations and small departures therefrom .",
    "therefore , in the standard treatments @xcite one restricts oneself to stationary space - times admitting event horizons and perturbations off such space - times .",
    "the isolated horizons ( ih ) framework , which is tailored to more general physical situations was introduced in @xcite and the corresponding zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics were established .",
    "@xcite . this framework generalizes the treatment of black hole mechanics in two directions .",
    "first , the notion of event horizons is replaced by that of ` isolated horizons ' which can be defined quasi - locally , unlike the former which can only be defined retroactively , after having access to the entire space - time history .",
    "second , the underlying space - time need not admit any killing field ; isolated horizons need not be killing horizons .",
    "the static event horizons normally used in black hole mechanics @xcite are special cases of isolated horizons .",
    "moreover , because one can now admit gravitational and matter radiation , there are many more examples . in particular , while the manifold @xmath1 of static space - times admitting event horizons in the einstein - maxwell theory is finite dimensional , the manifold @xmath2 of space - times admitting isolated horizons is _ infinite _ dimensional @xcite .",
    "the resulting formalism is then , not only a step in the construction of the quantum theory for the sector but also a new tool for studying classical aspects of black holes . when restricted to the static sector of the theory , it leads , for example , to an improvement in the treatment of the physical process version of the first law of black hole mechanics @xcite .",
    "the formalism has so far only been applied to the einstein - maxwell system ( with and without dilaton field ) , of which the known exact solutions ( the reissner nordstrom solutions in em and the so called gibbons - maeda solutions in emd ) are particular examples .    in this work we will explore the extent to which this formalism can be extended to the einstein - yang - mills theory where , in the static spherically symmetric sector , one finds the so called colored black hole solutions @xcite . the motivation is many - fold .",
    "first , we are interested in studying the robustness of the isolated horizons formalism in its ability to treat other theories , specially those where ` hairy ' solutions are know to exist . from the isolated horizons perspective",
    ", this poses a special challenge , since now there is an apparent tension given by the mismatch between the number of conserved charges at infinity and at the horizon . in the colored black hole solutions , the only non - zero ` charge ' at infinity is the adm mass , but the gauge field is non - vanishing at the horizon and it contributes to the ` horizon magnetic charge ' .",
    "is the isolated horizon framework robust enough to deal with this situation and to resolve this tension ?",
    "second , we would like to know whether the general formalism allows us to learn new facts about the static spherically symmetric ( sss ) solutions .",
    "in particular , we want to understand what differences , if any , appear when we treat static but unstable black hole solutions , which is the case for the abelian magnetic solutions and the higher @xmath3 colored black holes .",
    "finally , we want to investigate whether the formalism can as can be expected given the fact that it yields a satisfactory treatment of the inner boundary in hamiltonian terms allow us to take the limit when the horizon area goes to zero and connect the black hole solutions with the regular , solitonic , solutions that are known to also exist in this theory .",
    "we will in fact find answers to all of these questions and puzzles .",
    "we find however , some subtleties that need to be stressed . in particular",
    ", the fact that there are no spherically symmetric solutions for some values of the horizon parameters , poses a challenge to the isolated horizon framework , since there seems to be no canonical value for the horizon mass of the black hole in this situation .",
    "thus , if the eym system is to be in the same ` status ' as einstein - maxwell system , some yet unknown part of the current scenario would have to yield to the tension mentioned above .",
    "the most natural resolution would entail the validity of a ` uniqueness conjecture ' for static solutions and a ` completeness conjecture ' for the existence of stationary solutions , that we will put forward . their validity would guarantee the complete consistency of the formalism .",
    "on the other hand , we will show some new results regarding sss solutions as a nontrivial ` application ' of the formalism as it allows us to predict a relation between the adm mass of a static black hole solution , its horizon mass and the adm mass of the corresponding solitonic solutions .",
    "these relations can be corroborated by numerical computations ( consistent with the reported results in the literature ) .",
    "therefore , these ` coincidences ' can be viewed in a sense , as a check on the formalism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we recall some basic facts about the eym system and about the known sss solutions , both abelian and non - abelian . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we specify the isolated horizon boundary conditions that we impose , making the necessary adjustments to incorporate non - abelian gauge fields . section  [ sec4 ] deals with the action principle of the theory in the presence of the horizon as an inner boundary , and the specification of the phase space of the theory . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we consider the definition of surface gravity in the absence of a killing field and we show the zeroth law of bh mechanics for general isolated horizons .",
    "the definition of horizon mass together with the first law are studied in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "section  [ sec7 ] is devoted to the completeness conjecture and some of its implication for stationary solutions . in section  [ sec8 ]",
    ", we return to the study of static spherically symmetric solution to the eym equations from the perspective of isolated black holes , and show some new results .",
    "finally , we end with a discussion in section  [ sec9 ] .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we use units in which @xmath4 , and the abstract index notation of penrose s @xcite , except in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] where we use differential forms .",
    "this section has two parts . in the first one , we recall some basic facts about the einstein - yang - mills system . in the second part",
    ", we briefly review the static spherically symmetric solutions to the eym equations focusing on black hole solutions .      in the einstein - yang - mills system , the gravitational part of the action , @xmath5 is given by : s_grav = - _ r ^4x , and the matter part of the action is given by : s_ym ( ) = - _ ^4x[dil : act ] , where the abstract indices @xmath6 denote space - time objects and the indices @xmath7 are internal indices in the lie algebra of the gauge group @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we shall consider @xmath9 .",
    "the field strength @xmath10 is given by @xmath11}+ { \\epsilon^i}_{jk}\\ba_a^j\\ba_b^k$ ] , that is , the curvature of the lie algebra valued one form @xmath12 .",
    "the total action @xmath13 is given by s_tot = s_grav + s_ym .",
    "we remind the reader that in the case of a non - abelian yang mills theory there is dimension - full parameter @xmath14 that , unlike the abelian case , can not be absorbed in the  gauge \" fields .",
    "this endows the full theory with a natural scale at the classical level i.e. @xmath15 has dimensions of mass .",
    "the equations of motion that follow from @xmath13 are : d_a ^iab = 0 , [ dil : eom1 ] + r_ab= 2(^i_ac_ib^c - g_ab^2 ) , [ dil : eom3 ] where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the generalized covariant derivative defined by @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore we have the bianchi identity for the yang mills sector : d_[c^i_ab]=0 , the dual field tensor is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the canonical volume element associated with @xmath21 .",
    "note that in contrast with the einstein - maxwell system , where , under appropriate fall - of conditions , the conserved electric and magnetic charges can be defined at infinity , the naive expressions , ^i:=_s_^*^i , ^i:=_s_^i [ qyp ] , fail to be gauge invariant .",
    "it is only in the presence of a globally defined isometry that the conserved charges might be invariantly defined ( i.e. a natural gauge might be chosen ) .",
    "we can nevertheless define new gauge invariant quantities , for any two - sphere @xmath22 as follows , q_s:=_s|^*| , p_s:=_s|| [ qop ] , where @xmath23 is the two form defined in the following way : we take @xmath24 the area two form associated with the 2-sphere @xmath22 and define @xmath25 . then @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is analogously defined . in what follows",
    ", we shall refer to @xmath28 and @xmath29 as the electric and magnetic charge contained ` within ' @xmath22 respectively .",
    "static spherically symmetric ( sss ) solutions to the eym equations representing black hole space - times are known to exist in different situations ( for a recent review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a standard parameterization for the metric and gauge potential is given by , [ sss ] s^2 & = & -(1-)e^-2(r)t^2 + ( 1-)^-1r^2 + r^2 ^ 2 , [ param1 ] + & = & a_3 t + b_3r+(w_1+d_2)+(_3+w_2-d_1 ) , [ param2 ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are functions of @xmath32 .",
    "one can then look for either static regular solutions by requiring @xmath33 for all @xmath34 @xcite or for static black hole solutions with horizon at @xmath35 by requiring @xmath36 and @xmath33 for all @xmath37@xcite .",
    "solutions of both types are found in the purely magnetic sector , for which , with a further gauge choice one can set @xmath38 , and @xmath39 becomes a function of @xmath40 only .",
    "the regular or solitonic solutions compose a discrete set parameterized by the number of nodes of the function @xmath41 and are characterized by their adm mass whose scale is set by @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for every value of @xmath42 , one finds also two classes of black hole solutions : abelian and non - abelian .      the first class of solutions is given by what are essentially abelian solutions embedded in su(2 ) .",
    "within the abelian sector we have either electrically charged or magnetically charged solutions . unlike einstein - maxwell theory where the well known maxwell duality exists , in eym",
    "there is no such duality and one is not allowed to treat them on ` equal footing ' .",
    "the electrically charged solutions with electric charge @xmath43 are given by the standard solutions that can be described by choosing @xmath44 and @xmath45 in ( [ param2 ] ) .",
    "the ym potential is of the form @xmath46 and the metric is given by ( [ param1 ] ) with the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "note that these represent a two parameter family of ` rn solutions ' with parameters @xmath49 and @xmath43 .",
    "the magnetically charged solutions with magnetic charge @xmath50 are precisely the reissner - nordstrom solutions given by @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath48 .",
    "since we are considering the abelian case , the magnetic charge @xmath50 is not arbitrary but can take only one value @xmath53 .",
    "note that the ym field strength , in the ` magnetic ' sector of the eym theory takes the form , = w^_1r+ w^_2 r-(1-w^2)_3 .",
    "[ 2.11 ] thus , for the rn solutions where @xmath51 , we get from ( [ 2.11 ] ) that @xmath53 for any sphere containing the black hole .",
    "the magnetically charged solutions are then parameterized by only one charge , namely , the adm mass @xmath49 .",
    "these two sectors share the @xmath54 solution corresponding to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "one can also construct dyonic solutions with both electric charge @xmath43 and unit magnetic charge .",
    "in all these solutions , one has to satisfy the inequality @xmath55 , in order to have black hole solutions with no naked singularities .",
    "these solutions correspond to the purely magnetic case , where , for each value of the horizon area the equations have a discrete number of solutions which are strictly non - abelian in nature ( i.e. do not exit in the abelian regime ) .",
    "these are labeled by an integer @xmath3 that represents the number of nodes of the function @xmath41 .",
    "the lowest mode , @xmath56 , represents the schwarzschild solution .",
    "therefore , the solution can be completely parameterized by two numbers @xmath57 , the horizon area and the integer @xmath3 .",
    "all this solutions , for @xmath58 are unstable under perturbations @xcite .    on the other hand it is known that there are no nontrivial dyonic solutions ( i.e solutions with electric and magnetic fields ) in the spherically symmetric sector@xcite .    from a historical perspective , these were the first examples of ` hairy black holes ' @xcite .",
    "this is because the electric and magnetic charges ( [ qyp ] ) are both zero , so the only parameter at infinity is the adm mass . if the no - hair conjecture were valid for the eym system , the specification of @xmath59 would suffice to characterize the solution completely .",
    "however , this is not the case , since for a given value of the adm mass , there exist a countable number of _ different _ solutions , labeled by @xmath3 .",
    "equivalently we can label these solutions by the adm mass @xmath59 and @xmath3 .",
    "even when the charges at infinity are not enough to specify static black holes uniquely , one might still hope to have quasi - local quantities defined at the horizon , that are in a sense , good coordinates for the manifold @xmath1 of static solutions .",
    "indeed , we shall put forward in the following sections a ` quasi - local uniqueness conjecture ' ( @xmath60 ) : _ all static bh solutions are characterized by its horizon parameters arising from the ` isolated horizon ' framework_. let us refer to these quantities defined at the horizon as ` quasi - local parameters ' . in theories where no hair is present",
    ", as is the case of the einstein - maxwell - dilaton system , the number of ` quasi - local parameters ' equals the number of parameters at infinity labeling the static solutions @xcite .",
    "thus , stating a uniqueness conjecture in this theory is insensitive as to whether one is postulating it in terms of quantities at infinity ( the standard viewpoint ) , or in terms of ` quasi - local charges ' .",
    "our proposal is that , for general theories , one should state the postulate in terms of purely quasi - local quantities . in the eym system ,",
    "the quasi - local charges are @xmath61 , the horizon area , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the horizon electric and magnetic charges respectively . in this case the first conjecture @xmath60 reads : given a triple of parameters @xmath64 for which a sss solutions exists , then the solution is unique",
    ". however , note an apparent tension in this suggestion : given the mismatch of the number of parameters at the horizon and at infinity , there is room for inconsistency when formulating , say , the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "this is because the number of ` independent ' parameters is different , when one considers charges at infinity or quasi - local parameters for , say , sss colored solutions .",
    "as we shall see in section  [ sec6 ] , the nature of the problem can be made precise within the isolated horizons framework , and some ideas can be put forward to understand the origin of the difficulty .    for the convenience of the reader , in the next section",
    "we shall recall the notion of isolated horizons as defined in @xcite and explore some of its consequences for eym system of interest to this paper .",
    "let us recall the notion of isolated horizons @xmath65 in general , and include in its definition the relevant modifications to incorporate the einstein - yang - mills system .",
    "the basic boundary conditions defining @xmath65 are the same as those introduced in @xcite .",
    "let us begin by recalling some notation .",
    "fix any null surface @xmath66 , topologically @xmath67 , and consider foliations of @xmath68 by families of spatial 2-spheres . given a foliation , we parameterize its leaves by @xmath69 such that @xmath70 increases to the future and set @xmath71 . under a reparametrization @xmath72",
    ", we have @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "thus , every foliation comes equipped with an equivalence class @xmath75 $ ] of normals @xmath76 related by rescalings which are constant on each leaf .",
    "are defined intrinsically on @xmath68 .",
    "we can extend each @xmath76 to the full space - time uniquely by demanding that the extended 1-form be null .",
    "however , in this paper , we will not need this extension . ]",
    "also recall that , given any one @xmath76 , we can uniquely select a vector field @xmath77 which is normal to @xmath68 and satisfies @xmath78 .",
    "( thus , @xmath77 is future - pointing . )",
    "if we change the parameterization , @xmath77 transforms via : @xmath79 .",
    "thus , given a foliation , we acquire an equivalence class @xmath80 $ ] of pairs , @xmath81 , of vector fields and 1-forms on @xmath68 subject to the relation @xmath82 , where @xmath8 is any positive function on @xmath68 which is constant on each leaf of the foliation . given a pair @xmath81 in the equivalence class ,",
    "we introduce a complex vector field @xmath83 on @xmath68 , tangential to each leaf in the foliation , such that @xmath84 .",
    "( by construction , @xmath85 on @xmath68 . )",
    "the vector field @xmath83 is unique up to a phase factor . with this structure at hand",
    ", we now look at the main definition .    _",
    "definition : _ the internal boundary @xmath65 of a space - time @xmath86 will be said to represent _ a non - rotating isolated horizon _ provided the following conditions hold will denote equality at points of @xmath65 . for fields defined throughout space - time",
    ", an under - arrow will denote pull - back to @xmath65 .",
    "the part of the newman - penrose framework @xcite used in this paper is summarized in the appendices a and b of @xcite . ] :    * \\(i ) _ manifold conditions : _",
    "@xmath65 is a null surface , topologically @xmath87 . *",
    "\\(ii ) _ dynamical conditions : _ all field equations hold at @xmath65 . * \\(iii ) _ main conditions : _",
    "@xmath65 admits a foliation such that the newman - penrose coefficients associated with the corresponding direction fields @xmath88 $ ] on @xmath65 satisfy the following conditions : + ( iii.a ) @xmath89 , the expansion of @xmath90 $ ] , vanishes on @xmath65 .",
    "+ ( iii.b ) @xmath91 and @xmath92 vanish on @xmath65 and the expansion @xmath93 of @xmath76 is negative is everywhere positive on @xmath65 .",
    "see @xcite . ] and constant on each leaf of the foliation .",
    "* \\(iv ) _ conditions on matter : _ the yang - mills field @xmath94 is such that |re_1| , |im_1| , are constant on each leaf of the foliation introduced in condition ( iii ) .",
    "( recall that @xmath95 ) where @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is analogously defined .",
    "the first two conditions are quite tame : ( i ) simply asks that @xmath65 be null and have appropriate topology while ( ii ) is completely analogous to the dynamical condition imposed at infinity . as the terminology suggests , ( iii.a ) and ( iii.b ) are the most important conditions .",
    "note first that , if a pair @xmath98 in the equivalence class @xmath88 $ ] associated with the foliation satisfies these conditions , so does any other pair , @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the conditions are well - defined .",
    "they are motivated by the following considerations .",
    "condition ( iii.a ) captures the idea that the horizon is isolated without having to refer to a killing field .",
    "in particular , it implies that the area of each 2-sphere leaf in the foliation be the same .",
    "we will denote this area by @xmath61 and define the _ horizon radius _ @xmath100 via @xmath101 .",
    "condition ( iii.b ) has three sets of implications .",
    "first , one can show that if , as required , one can find a foliation of @xmath65 satisfying ( iii.b ) , that foliation is _",
    "unique_. ( in the sss family , as one might expect , this condition selects the foliation to which the rotational killing fields are tangential . )",
    "second , it implies that the imaginary part of ( the newman - penrose weyl component ) @xmath102 , which captures angular momentum , vanishes and thus restricts us to _ non - rotating _ horizons .",
    "third , the requirement that the expansion @xmath103 of @xmath104 be negative implies that @xmath65 is a _ future _ horizon rather than _ past _ horizon @xcite .",
    "finally , consider the spherical symmetry requirement on the yang - mills field component @xmath105 given by condition ( iv ) .",
    "while this condition is a strong restriction , it can be motivated by analogy with the einstein - maxwell case .",
    "( for further motivation and remarks on these conditions , see @xcite . )",
    "since these conditions are _ local _ to @xmath65 , the notion of an isolated horizon is quasi - local ; in particular , one does not need an entire space - time history to locate an isolated horizon .",
    "furthermore , the boundary conditions allow for the presence of radiation in the exterior region , thus , space - times admitting isolated horizons need not admit any killing field @xcite .",
    "indeed , the manifold @xmath2 of solutions to field equations admitting isolated horizons is infinite dimensional @xcite ) .    in spite of this generality ,",
    "boundary conditions place strong restrictions on the structure of various fields _ at _ @xmath65 .",
    "let us begin with conditions on the yang - mills field .",
    "the stress - energy tensor @xmath106 of @xmath94 satisfies the dominant energy condition .",
    "hence , on @xmath65 , @xmath107 is a future directed , causal vector field .",
    "now , using the raychaudhuri equation and field equations _ at _ @xmath65 ( condition ( ii ) of the definition ) , we conclude @xmath108 . by expanding out this expression ( see eq ( [ dil : eom3 ] ) ) we obtain [ 3.2 ] ^i_ab = ^i_1 2 ( _[a n_b ] - m_[a |m_b ] ) + ^i_2 2 ( m_[a _b])+cc , for _ some _ complex algebra - valued functions @xmath105 and @xmath109 ( the only non - vanishing newman - penrose components of @xmath110 ) on @xmath65 , where @xmath111 stands for ` the complex conjugate term ' .",
    "these equations say that there is no flux of yang - mills radiation across @xmath65 .",
    "finally , condition ( iv ) in the definition implies    charge and @xmath63 the magnetic charge at the horizon as defined by ( [ qop ] ) .",
    "thus the boundary conditions severely restrict the form of matter fields at @xmath65 .",
    "the component @xmath112 of the ym field vanishes and the gauge invariant components of @xmath105 are completely determined by the electric and magnetic charges . however , the component @xmath109 of the ym field is unconstrained .",
    "restrictions imposed on space - time curvature at @xmath65 are essentially the same as in ref @xcite .",
    "connection associated with the dyad @xmath113 .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "results relevant to this paper can be summarized as follows . in the newman - penrose notation , for the ricci tensor components",
    ", we have : [ ricci ] _ 00 & = & r_ab ^a^b = 0 , _ 01 = r_ab^a m^b = 0 , + _ 11 & = & r_ab ( ^an^b + m^a|m^b ) = 8 ^ 2 , r = 0 , where @xmath114 is the scalar curvature .",
    "the weyl tensor components satisfy [ weyl ] _ 0 & = & c_abcd^am^b^cm^d = 0 , _ 1 = c_abcd^am^b^cn^d = 0 , + _ 2 & = & c_abcd^a m^b|m^c n^d = _ 11 - .",
    "furthermore , _ 3 = _ 21 , c_abcd^an^b|m^cn^d = r_ab|m^an^b .",
    "as expected , for the sss solutions discussed in section [ sec2 ] , these conditions are satisfied .",
    "we note that even when the curvature components @xmath102 and @xmath115 are the only ones different from zero in sss solutions , for a general isolated horizon other curvature components ( like @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) may be ` dynamical ' , i.e. , vary along the integral curves of @xmath118 .    in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton system @xcite , we have a set of parameters @xmath119 at the horizon ( and the same number at infinity ) , and those parameters were naturally selected as the horizon parameters . in the eym case we have seen that we can define electric and magnetic charges at the horizon @xmath120 .",
    "the boundary conditions ensure that this quantities are constant along the horizon @xmath65 ( and explicitly gauge invariant ) .",
    "thus , it is natural to use the triplet @xmath121 to parameterize general eym isolated horizons .",
    "let us denote by @xmath122 the space of horizon parameters with coordinates @xmath123 , with the following restrictions : @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the gravitational action has been shown to be differentiable , with respect to variations respecting the isolated horizons boundary conditions , in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to those papers for details .",
    "one important property of the variational principle is that one is varying , in the pure gravitational case , histories with a fixed value @xmath126 of the horizon area .",
    "we also need to ensure that the matter action is differentiable and work out the hamiltonian framework for the matter sector as well .",
    "this could require imposition of additional boundary conditions on matter fields , but as we will see , the conditions already imposed on matter , described in sec",
    ".  [ sec3 ] will be enough .",
    "the purpose of this section is concentrate on the variational principle for the yang - mills field and work out the hamiltonian description .",
    "since we require that field equations hold on @xmath65 , the gravitational boundary conditions already imply certain restrictions on the behavior of ym fields there . as noted in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "boundary conditions imply that several components of the ricci tensor vanish on @xmath65 , and that the curvature tensor @xmath94 has the form ( [ 3.2 ] ) .",
    "in particular @xmath127 and @xmath128 are spherically symmetric on the preferred cross - sections . in that case , @xmath129 can be expressed in terms of the electric and magnetic charges , @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the isolated horizon , @xmath130 ( here @xmath131 are the 2-spheres @xmath69 in the preferred foliation .",
    "the minus sign in front of the first integrals in ( [ el - charge ] ) and ( [ magn - charge ] ) arise because we have oriented @xmath131 such that the radial normal is in - going rather than outgoing . )",
    "let s now discuss the action principle .",
    "for the same reasons that the area @xmath61 is kept fixed in the variational principle , we will now restrict ourselves to histories for which the values of electric and magnetic charges on the horizon are fixed to @xmath132 and @xmath133 respectively . to make the action principle well - defined",
    ", we need to impose suitable boundary conditions on the ym fields .",
    "conditions at infinity are the standard ones given in @xcite . to find boundary conditions on @xmath65 , let us consider the standard ym bulk action : @xmath134 variation of @xmath135 yields @xmath136}^i \\,{\\tilde{\\eta}}^{abc}\\d^3x.\\ ] ] as usual , the bulk term provides the equations of motion provided the surface term vanishes .",
    "the boundary term ( [ ch : variation ] ) at infinity is the usual one and is dealt with in the standard manner @xcite . when evaluated at the horizon , the boundary term ( [ ch : variation ] ) does not automatically vanish . on @xmath65 , the boundary term in ( [ ch : variation ] ) can be written as , _",
    "^i_a^*_ibc ^[c^ab]v^2x .",
    "now , ( [ 3.2 ] ) implies that on @xmath65 the pull - back of @xmath137 vanishes .",
    "then , the horizon contribution reduces to @xmath138 where , as before , @xmath70 is the affine parameter ( with respect to the horizon metric ) along the integral curves of @xmath77 such that @xmath69 define the preferred foliation of @xmath65 and @xmath131 are the 2-spheres in this foliation .",
    "now , since isolated horizons are to be thought of as `` non - dynamical '' , it is natural to ask that the gauge field @xmath139 be invariant under the action of @xmath118 .",

    "recall that the isolated horizon is naturally equipped with equivalence classes @xmath188 $ ] of vector and co - vector fields , subject to the relation : @xmath189 for any positive function @xmath190 on @xmath65 . as we already mentioned ,",
    "our first task is to reduce the freedom in the choice of @xmath191 to that of a constant .",

    "constancy of @xmath184 on @xmath65 follows from the same arguments that were used in @xcite . for completeness ,",

    "first , using conditions on derivatives of @xmath196 introduced in the definition , one can express the self - dual part of the riemann curvature in terms of @xmath197 ( and another field which is not relevant to this discussion ) . comparing this expression to the standard newman - penrose expansion of the self - dual curvature tensor in terms of curvature scalars @xcite , and using the fact that certain curvature scalars vanish on @xmath65 ( see ( [ ricci ] ) and ( [ weyl ] ) )",
    ", one can conclude [ 4.13 ] ( _ [ a_ ) n_b ] = 0 , _",
    "the first equation implies that @xmath184 is spherically symmetric .",
    "hence , it only remains to show that @xmath198 .",
    "since @xmath103 is now a constant on @xmath65 , it suffices to show that @xmath199 .",
    "now , the ( second ) bianchi identity implies that [ bi ] l_ ( _ 2 - _ 11 ) = 0 . finally , using ( [ 3.2 ] ) , we conclude : @xmath200 .",
    "thus , @xmath115 is constants on @xmath65 . combining these results , we conclude @xmath201 , whence @xmath184 is constant on @xmath65 .",
    "this establishes the zeroth law .",
    "let us now consider the second step in fixing the normalization of @xmath118 .",
    "so far , we have only required that @xmath103 be a ( negative ) constant but not fixed its value . under the rescaling @xmath202",
    "we have : @xmath203 , and @xmath204 .",
    "hence , the remaining rescaling freedom in @xmath118 and @xmath180 can be exhausted simply by fixing the value of @xmath103 in terms of the isolated horizon parameters .",
    "we would like to single out a canonical choice , and the obvious strategy is to fix @xmath103 to the value @xmath205 it takes on the sss solutions .",
    "however , there are two difficulties : first , although @xmath205 is a well - defined function of the isolated horizon parameters @xmath206 and @xmath63 , where static solutions exist , there is no closed expression for it in terms of these parameters simply because the full set of solutions ( including the colored black holes ) is not known in closed form .",
    "the second and more serious problem is that , for an arbitrary point in parameter space , there might not be any sss solution ( recall that the colored black holes span only a countable number of points in the @xmath63 axis for a given value of @xmath100 ) . as we shall see in next section",
    ", one can still have a consistent hamiltonian formulation and a first law even for those isolated horizons lying on points of the parameter space where no sss solutions exist .",
    "but , as should be clear from the discussion , at this point there is no canonical normalization of @xmath103 on the whole space @xmath2 .",
    "even when we can not find an explicit functional form for @xmath103 , we can still write the general form that @xmath184 shall have . using an identity coming from the isolated horizons boundary condition we have the following relation @xcite , _ = ( -+ _ 11 ) .",
    "using the expression for @xmath115 in terms of the charges ( [ ricci ] ) we have , _ =- . for those points of parameter space @xmath122 where an sss static solution exists",
    ", we can go further and make use of the general form of the metric ( [ sss ] ) .",
    "one then finds that the expansion of the properly normalized @xmath3 is such that _ sss=- .",
    "a coordinate transformation can always render @xmath207 , so the properly normalized @xmath180 for general isolated horizons takes the form , [ 5.8 ] = .",
    "it is in a sense remarkable that our ignorance about the explicit form of the solutions is encoded in the function @xmath208 .",
    "we end this section with a discussion .",
    "as we have emphasized in this section , any choice of @xmath103 in terms of the horizon parameters defines a vector field @xmath77 and a surface gravity on @xmath2 .",
    "however , one would like to make contact with the space of static solutions in such a way that the surface gravity @xmath209 coincides with the surface gravity of the properly normalized killing field . in the case of einstein - maxwell - dilaton @xcite",
    "this was indeed possible since the static solutions span the space of horizon parameters @xmath122 .",
    "that is , for each value of the isolated horizon parameters , there exists a ( unique ) static solution which allows us to fix @xmath103 in a unique , canonical way . in the case of eym , the space of sss solutions does not span @xmath122 .",
    "one is able to canonically fix @xmath180 only in this subspace ; for a general point , there is no preferred normalization .",
    "this seems to be a serious shortcoming of the formalism that might place the eym system on a different status than the em and emd systems .",
    "as we shall see in next section , this ambiguity is also manifested in the definition of mass .",
    "however , this problem will also motivate a second conjecture that we shall put forward in section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "the space - times that admit an isolated horizon are not necessarily stationary , therefore , it is no longer meaningful to identify the adm mass @xmath49 with the mass @xmath210 of the isolated horizon . for the formulation of the first law",
    ", we must first introduce an appropriate definition of @xmath210 .",
    "this definition should be general enough in the sense that , for each choice for the normalization of @xmath77 , the mass should be uniquely defined , and the first law should be valid for _ any _ choice of normalization .",
    "as we shall see , the hamiltonian framework provides a natural strategy . in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton case",
    "the total hamiltonian consists of a bulk term and _ two _ surface terms , one at infinity and the other at the isolated horizon . as usual , the bulk term is a linear combination of constraints and the surface term at infinity yields the adm energy . in a rest - frame adapted to the horizon",
    "it is then natural to identify the surface term at @xmath65 as the horizon mass , @xmath210 .",
    "indeed , there are several considerations that support this identification @xcite .    for the gravitational part of the action and hamiltonian , the discussion of @xcite only assumed that the stress - energy tensor satisfies two conditions at @xmath65 : i ) @xmath211 is a future pointing causal vector field on @xmath65 ; and , ii ) @xmath212 is spherically symmetric on @xmath65 .",
    "both these conditions are met in the present case .",
    "therefore , we can take over the results of @xcite directly . for the matter part of the action and hamiltonian",
    ", the overall situation is again analogous , although there are the obvious differences in the detailed expressions . as in the einstein - maxwell case ,",
    "matter terms contribute to the surface terms in the hamiltonian only because one has to perform one integration by parts to obtain the gauss constraint in the bulk term .",
    "the net result is the following .",
    "consider a foliation of the given space - time region @xmath213 by a 1-parameter family of ( partial ) cauchy surfaces @xmath151 , each of which extends from the isolated horizon @xmath65 to spatial infinity @xmath214 ( see figure ) .",
    "we will assume that @xmath151 intersects @xmath65 in a 2-sphere belonging to our preferred foliation and that the initial data induced on @xmath151 are asymptotically flat .",
    "denote by @xmath215 and @xmath216 the 2-sphere boundary of @xmath151 at the horizon and infinity , respectively .",
    "choose a time - like vector field @xmath153 in @xmath213 which tends to the unit time - translation orthogonal to the foliation at spatial infinity and to the vector field @xmath77 on @xmath65 , with the normalization fixed ( or partially fixed ) as in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "then , the hamiltonian @xmath217 generating evolution along @xmath153 is given by : [ ham ] h_t & = & _ m_t constraints+ _ r_o _ s_r_o ( _ 2 ) ^2-_q _ + & + & _ s _ ( _ 2 ) ^2 + |(l)|q_+ v , where @xmath218 are large 2-spheres of radius @xmath219 and @xmath220 is a constant on @xmath176 , the space of isolated horizons with fixed values of the horizon parameters .",
    "( the calculation and the final result are completely analogous to those in the einstein - maxwell case @xcite . )",
    "note that the surface terms depend only on the ` coulombic ' parts of the gravitational and yang - mills fields .",
    "it is easy to check that the surface term at infinity is , as usual , the time component @xmath221 of the adm 4-momentum @xmath222 , which in the present ( -,+,+,+ ) signature is negative of the adm energy , @xmath223 .",
    "it is natural to identify the surface term at @xmath215 as the energy of the isolated horizon .",
    "( there is no minus sign because @xmath215 is the _ inner _ boundary of @xmath49 ) . since @xmath224 and",
    "since @xmath77 represents the ` rest frame ' of the isolated horizon , this energy can in turn be identified with the horizon mass @xmath210 .",
    "thus , we have : [ mass ] m^()_= _ s _ ( _ 2 ) ^2 + |(l)|q_+ v_()(a_,q_,p _ ) . here , the so far undetermined function @xmath220 , depends only on the horizon parameters ( and coupling constants ) . in the variational principle",
    ", this term played no role , but in the hamiltonian description it becomes essential , since we are now interested in variations along the full isolated horizons phase space @xmath2 .",
    "thus , one should be able to consider in the formalism displacements along directions in which the horizon parameters change . as we shall show below ,",
    "requiring a consistent hamiltonian formulation enables us to determine the function @xmath220 for the eym system .",
    "now , using the expression ( [ 4.13 ] ) of surface gravity in terms of the weyl tensor ( and @xmath103 ) , and calling @xmath225 on @xmath65 , we can cast @xmath210 in a more familiar form : [ smarr ] m_= a _ + _",
    "q_+ v(a_,q_,p _ ) , where we have dropped the explicit @xmath77 dependence of the mass for notational simplicity . thus , as in the einstein - maxwell case",
    ", we obtain a smarr formula .",
    "however , the meaning of various symbols in the equation is somewhat different .",
    "since an isolated horizon need not be a killing horizon , in general @xmath210 does equal the adm mass , nor is @xmath180 or @xmath226 computed using a killing field . since the constraints are satisfied in any solution , the bulk term in ( [ ham ] ) vanishes as well .",
    "hence , in this case , @xmath227 , the difference being the ` radiative energy ' in the space - time . finally , as emphasized in @xcite , the matter contribution to the mass formula ( [ mass ] ) is subtle : while it does not include the energy in radiation outside the horizon , it does include the energy in the ` coulombic part ' of the field associated with the black hole hair .",
    "( recall that the future limit of the bondi energy has this property . )",
    "this fact is crucial to the analysis of the ` physical process version ' of the first law .",
    "however , since this issue was discussed in detail in @xcite , we shall not discuss this here .",
    "now , a consistent hamiltonian formulation ( for a sector of a diffeomorphism invariant theory ) requires that for an arbitrary vector @xmath208 tangent to the symplectic manifold , ( i.e. the phase space @xmath228 ) , one has h = ( , x_h ) , [ 1 ] where @xmath229 is the vector field that corresponds to the equations of motion for a given choice of lapse and shift , and @xmath230 is the hamiltonian function corresponding to the same choice of lapse and shift . in the preceding prescription one",
    "assumes that the evaluation of @xmath231 is carried out by considering the change in @xmath230 associated with the displacement @xmath208 of the phase space point , but keeping the lapse and shift _",
    "fixed_. if we now let the choice of lapse and shift depend on the phase space point as is the case when @xmath118 is normalized as in sec .",
    "[ sec5] we would obtain a _ new _",
    "variation @xmath232 .",
    "this might fail to satisfy = ( , x_h ) , with the _ same _ @xmath229 as in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the necessary and sufficient condition to obtain the required consistency is the validity of the first law@xcite .",
    "m_= 18 a_+ _ q _ . [ firstlaw ]",
    "that is , the first law of black hole mechanics -for quantities defined only at the horizon- arises naturally as part of the requirements for a consistent hamiltonian formulation in which , for every value of the horizon parameters , one has chosen a canonical lapse and shift functions making the latter dependent on the point in phase space . note that in contrast with the above situation , when constructing a hamiltonian to deal with the analogous problem at infinity , the canonical choice of normalization of lapse and shift at infinity is taken as independent of the phase space point , namely , they are chosen to correspond to a unit time translation ( normal to the initial - data hyper - surface ) at infinity .    in the cases of einstein vacuum , einstein - maxwell and einstein - maxwell - dilaton theories ,",
    "this consistency requirement translate into an identity that is automatically satisfied by the expressions of @xmath210 , @xmath180 etc , for all values of the parameters and variations there - off . in the case of einstein - yang - mills theory , -as well as in other theories where hair is present- , the only way to ensure the validity of the consistency requirement is to limit the class of variations @xmath208 allowed .",
    "this has two dramatic consequences : first , it defines a foliation of phase space by a collection of ( symplectic ) leaves over which the hamiltonian formulation is consistent , a situation which puts the construction in the ` non - standard ' class .",
    "in fact , some simple systems are described by a similar type of situation , as for example the ( reduced ) hamiltonian description of a rotating body where the -3 dimensional- phase space is foliated by two spheres , each of which is a true symplectic manifold where the hamiltonian motion is restricted @xcite .",
    "second , the status of the first law changes from that of an identity , valid for all variations , to that of a specification of the class of variations that the formalism allows .",
    "it is important to note that in the first law ( [ firstlaw ] ) only variations of the electric charge are involved , and not variations of the magnetic charge . on the other hand , the horizon mass ( [ smarr ] )",
    "might depend on @xmath63 through @xmath220 .",
    "let us now see that asking consistency of the formalism leads us to some conditions that the function @xmath220 should satisfy . in order to do this",
    "we shall follow , for completeness , ref .",
    "@xcite closely .",
    "the first step in this direction is to regard ( [ firstlaw ] ) as an identity between one forms @xmath233 , where @xmath234 and @xmath220 are functions on @xmath122 .",
    "thus one can consider differential forms on @xmath122 and take an exterior derivative of the ` first law ' to arrive at , 0=a_+_q _ .",
    "[ cond1 ] the first conclusion coming from ( [ cond1 ] ) is that the variations on @xmath122 are restricted to sub - manifolds such that the pull - back of the form @xmath235 vanishes .",
    "that is , @xmath63 is not free to vary independently of @xmath100 and @xmath62 .",
    "this is precisely what happens for sss solutions ( representing only a _",
    "discrete _ set of curves in the plane @xmath236 ) and in the static axial - symmetric case @xcite ( also covering a discrete set of curves in the plane ) . from now on ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the symplectic leaves where the formalism is well defined . on these sub - manifolds",
    "the magnetic charge becomes a function of the area and electric charge , @xmath237 .",
    "second , the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) gives us a relation between @xmath180 and @xmath226 , = 8 .",
    "[ cond1.5 ] thus , if we know the surface gravity @xmath180 then we can derive an expression for the potential @xmath226 .    finally , taking the variation of ( [ smarr ] ) and comparing it to ( [ firstlaw ] ) we arrive at the following equations , [ cond2 ] a_+ 8r _ q _",
    "+ 8r _ & = & 0 , + + q _ + & = & 0 , [ cond3 ] where @xmath238 and , for convenience , we have defined @xmath239 .",

    "note that these equations are defined over the horizon parameters space @xmath122 , so they are completely _ local _ to the horizon @xmath65 .",
    "recall that the general prescription for arriving at an explicit expression for surface gravity @xmath180 , for general isolated horizons , involves the fixing of the expansion @xmath103 as function of the horizon parameters .",
    "for this , one requires some input from the sss solutions ( where they exist ) .",
    "however , it is important to stress that the results of this section regarding a consistent hamiltonian formulation and the validity of the first law , are independent of the particular choice of normalization @xmath103 ( and @xmath180 ) that one makes .",

    "we shall consider the three classes of sss solutions described in section  [ sec2 ] , and find expressions for their surface gravity @xmath180 and horizon masses @xmath210 . as discussed before , a study of the three sectors of sss solutions serves two purposes .",

    "first , we must emphasize that the determination of @xmath220 , and thus of @xmath210 relied on considerations involving only variations of quantities associated with the horizon @xmath65 .",

    "second , the hhm defined by ( [ smarr ] ) , when restricted to sss configurations , does not agree with the usual definitions of mass that one finds in the literature ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it should be stressed that ( [ 13 ] ) comes from a consistent hamiltonian formulation , and is _ not _ a definition as occurs in other treatments .    as it was discussed at the end of section  [ sec5 ] ,",
    "the fact that sss solutions to the eym equations do not span the space @xmath122 of horizon parameters is , in a sense , disturbing .",
    "it might seem that the einstein - yang - mills system is in a different status than the einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) system where the space of horizon parameters is in a one to one correspondence with the space of static solutions .",
    "one would like to have a similar result in the eym case .",
    "however , the sss solutions span only a subspace of @xmath122 .",
    "luckily , the spherically symmetric solutions in eym do not exhaust all possible static solutions ( as occurs in emd ) ; there are static solutions with axial symmetry that are not spherically symmetric @xcite . with these results at hand ,",
    "we propose a completeness conjecture in the next section .",
    "we have seen that in order for the isolated horizons scheme to define the surface gravity and the horizon mass of the colored black holes we needed to introduce a uniqueness conjecture @xmath60 that guarantees that , given the isolated horizon parameters @xmath261 , there would be at most one sss solution .",
    "this was needed for , otherwise , the normalization of @xmath103 would not be uniquely specified given those parameters .",
    "the existing numerical evidence does indeed strongly support this conjecture .",

    "there are no such static solutions .",
    "the consistency of the whole scheme would require the impossibility of constructing a space - time containing an isolated horizon with such values of the parameters .",

    "there is a strong correlation of these issues with the cosmic censorship conjecture , that prevents us from violating the inequality @xmath262 for static solutions .",
    "it would seem that the ih formalism implies that one can not construct initial data for a solution containing a black hole with values of the parameters that violate this inequality . ]",
    "there is strong numerical evidence against the validity of the analogous claim in the case of the eym system .",
    "in fact in the regime of staticity and spherical symmetry there are , given a fixed value of @xmath61 , only a discrete set of values of @xmath63 for which there are black hole solutions .",
    "moreover , within this regime there are no black hole solutions for any value of @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "thus if we want to have any hope that any claim in that direction might be true , we must formulate it outside this restrictive regime . indeed the fact that in eym systems there are static black hole solutions that are not spherically symmetric , ( indicating that that the analogous to israel s theorem is false in this case ) , already shows us that we must go beyond the sss regime",
    ". in fact the solutions alluded above are axially symmetric , instead of spherically symmetric , but seem to share , with the sss solutions , the discreetness of the allowed values of @xmath63 ( at least to the extent that this issue has been studied @xcite ) .",
    "thus we have to go beyond this regime as well .",
    "in fact there are strong indications ( see for example the discussion in @xcite ) that we must go beyond the static regime , and pose the conjecture in a broad enough setting that would still allow one to single out , for a given choice of ih parameters , a particular black hole solution and thus a canonical normalization of @xmath103 .",
    "this would be of course the class of stationary black hole solutions , where we would have to keep track also of the angular momentum , both at infinity @xmath265 and at the horizon @xmath266 .",
    "the completeness conjecture would thus be : @xmath267 : _ for every value of the isolated horizon parameters @xmath268 for which a space - time can be constructed , there exist also a stationary black hole solution with the same value of the parameters , now characterizing the killing horizon_.    let us now consider some of the implications of this conjecture .",
    "first , a stationary black hole solution would be characterized by its parameters at infinity : @xmath269 and therefore the conjecture would imply the existence of a well defined map @xmath270 the failure of the no hair conjecture would indicate that this map is not invertible .",
    "in fact we know that it would not be injective . moreover",
    "the map would be nontrivally four dimensional , in the sense that fixing , say , @xmath271 would not fix @xmath272 , as can be seen from the following expression , @xcite 4(j_-j_)=_^3x ( t^b^a_i ^i_ab+l_t(^i_a)^a_i ) , [ sw : a ] valid for stationary black hole solutions in eym theory . here",

    ", @xmath266 is a particular definition of ` horizon angular momentum ' ( given by a komar integral ) , and @xmath275 stands for the angular velocity of the horizon , i.e , the expression appearing in the first law m_adm+_q_-j_=a _ , [ sw : b ] where @xmath276 is the ` electric potential ' at infinity .",
    "in fact the eym system is , in this respect , rather different from the einstein - maxwell system , because in the latter one can disentangle for example the expression for @xmath277 from the expression for @xmath278 , something that can not be done in the former@xcite , in which case the only relationship that can be obtained is given by the expression , 8(j_-_q_)= _ n(_ab^ab+2^a_i_a^i)/h , with @xmath279 the momentum conjugate to @xmath155 , the riemannian metric on @xmath49 and @xmath157 the ` lapse function ' .    assuming the validity of @xmath267 one would have a canonical choice for the normalizations that could be used to uniquely define @xmath180 and @xmath210 , the one provided by the killing field of the stationary solution that is null at the horizon and that is normalized so that at infinity is a unit time translation . in order to make all these considerations more precise from the isolated horizons point of view",
    ", one needs to consider the extension of the formalism given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "now , let us concentrate for the moment in the sss sector and see if we can understand the discreteness observed there in terms of this conjecture . in the analysis that lead to the discovery of sss black holes in eym theory ,",
    "one is fixing @xmath280 because one is interested in solutions that are abelian at large distances .",
    "moreover spherical symmetry evidently requires @xmath281 and @xmath282 .",
    "moreover the mixture alluded to before would prevent us from achieving this ( spherical symmetry ) unless we also set @xmath283 .",
    "thus we see that the ( highly nonlinear ) problem is given by four constraints in a four dimensional space , and thus that the set of solutions is expected to be given by a discrete set ( i.e. the linearized problem about a given solution in the sss sector has no nontrivial solution within the sector ) .",
    "next , let us consider some consequences of the completeness conjecture in the structure of the space @xmath122 .",
    "we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] that the space @xmath2 ( where we now have to include distortion and rotation @xcite ) is foliated by ` symplectic leaves ' where the hamiltonian formulation and the first law are valid .",
    "this foliation intersects the space @xmath1 of stationary solutions and defines a one parameter foliation of it .",
    "now , if the @xmath267 conjecture is valid , we have an isomorphism between @xmath1 and @xmath122 , which then induces a canonical foliation of @xmath122 .    on the other hand , we must point out the following heuristic argument against the conjecture .",
    "consider a stationary black hole solution in eym theory , in order to be asymptotically flat the ym field strength must fall off rather rapidly at large distances , thus the self interaction of the fields must be falling off faster than the fields themselves and thus the fields must behave in the large distance limit as free fields , i.e. , as abelian fields .",
    "this suggests that the only possible values of the magnetic charge at @xmath284 , @xmath285 are the abelian values @xmath286 ( there is of course no such restriction on the allowed value of the electric charge ) .",
    "this view is supported by the experience with the static spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "thus , any stationary solution would be characterized at infinity by the parameters @xmath287 ( setting for the moment @xmath280 to simplify the discussion ) .",
    "on the other hand the solution will be characterized by its horizon parameters amongst them @xmath61 .",
    "we know from the first law in its asymptotic infinity version eq .",
    "( [ sw : b ] ) ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , that the stationary black hole solutions are extrema of @xmath59 at fixed @xmath288 within the constrained phase space ( i.e. , the space of allowed initial data , which as usual , can be identified with the space of solutions ) .",
    "each such extrema is an isolated point in that space , so the manifold of stationary solutions is three dimensional . in @xcite",
    "an argument is given that indicates that there would be a countable infinity of solutions for each value of the parameters @xmath289 which would generalize what happens in the case of the static solutions .",
    "this suggest that the manifold of stationary solutions is made of a countable infinity of connected three dimensional components . on the other hand",
    ", the conjecture would seem to indicate that such manifold must be four dimensional . the only way to avoid this would require the impossibility of constructing solutions of the equations representing asymptotically flat black hole space - times ( not necessarily stationary ) containing isolated horizons for all values of the isolated horizon parameters .",

    "unfortunately this claim is evidently false : the recipe for constructing such a space - time is to give initial data that , upon evolution would be static near the horizon and near infinity at least for a finite  time \" interval .",

    "on the other hand the argument above is by not means a tight proof , particularly so in the case of the conclusion about the abelian nature of the allowed values of @xmath285 . as we have mentioned before , the validity of this conjecture , or some version of it ( as for example a version based on the assumption that the manifold of stationary solutions is mapped into a dense subset of the isolated horizon parameters ) , seems to be the only reasonable way in which the isolated horizon scheme can be as successful in the general case as it has proven to be in the einstein vacuum , einstein - maxwell and einstein - maxwell - dilaton theories .",
    "needless is to say that further research is required in order to elucidate whether one of the scenarios considered above is correct or whether , in fact , the isolated horizon scheme fails to achieve in eym theory the same degree of success that is attained in the previously treated cases .",
    "in this section we shall restrict our attention to the sss sector of isolated horizons .",
    "one issue that has been considered for non - abelian gauge theories is the relation that might exist between the existence of regular static , solitonic solutions and ` hairy ' black hole solutions .",
    "this issue has been considered , for example , in @xcite from heuristic and dimensional arguments . in this section ,",
    "two main issues are studied .",
    "first , by restricting the hamiltonian formulation for isolated black holes to the sss sector , we can define the hamiltonian horizon mass ( hhm ) of sss black holes in eym theory .",
    "we then use this expression to show that this quasi - local definition together with some basic properties of hamiltonian mechanics lead us to a formula relating hhm and adm mass of the colored bh solutions with the adm mass of the solitons of the theory .",
    "we also conclude that the positivity of the ` total energy ' spectrum of the colored black holes is related to their instability .",
    "these results are quite surprising , because the ih formalism was developed to extend the notion of black holes to situations where radiation is present and goes out to infinity and one might have not expected to obtain new results already in the static sector of the theory .",
    "as we have previously mentioned , the hhm mass @xmath210 of a sss bh does not correspond to any of the quasi - local definitions of bh mass considered in the literature .",
    "furthermore , @xmath210 has the virtue of being constructed from a consistent hamiltonian formulation which places it on a different status as the standard definitions .",
    "to begin , let us calculate the value of the ` total energy ' @xmath249 of the system , for the three sectors of sss solutions .",
    "in order to do this , we use a general argument from symplectic geometry that states that , within each connected component of the space of static solutions @xmath1 embedded in the space of isolated horizons , the value of the hamiltonian @xmath217 remains constant @xcite .",
    "let us review this argument since it is essential for our discussion .",
    "the hamilton equations of motion can be written as @xmath300 , where @xmath275 is the symplectic form , @xmath208 is an arbitrary variation and @xmath229 is the hamiltonian vector field .",
    "a static solution is one at which the hamiltonian vector field either vanishes or generates pure gauge evolution . in either case , the symplectic structure evaluated on @xmath229 and _ any _ arbitrary vector field @xmath208 vanishes .",
    "therefore , for this point of the phase space , @xmath301 for any direction @xmath208 . in particular @xmath301 for variations relating two static solutions .",
    "now , in the case of einstein - maxwell theory , the no - hair theorems ensure that all static solutions are given by the rn family .",
    "that is , the space of static solutions is in that case , connected .",
    "furthermore , since there is no energy scale in the theory , the only ` preferred ' value for @xmath217 is zero @xcite .",
    "what is the situation in einstein - yang - mills theory ?",
    "first , there is the abelian family of electrically charged solutions , that represent a connected component , parameterized by @xmath302 . for these solutions ,",
    "the basic reasoning of @xcite applies and , as follows from ( [ 7.4 ] ) and ( [ 7.5 ] ) , one has to conclude that for these solutions @xmath303 .",
    "however , there is a subtle modification in the case of magnetic abelian solutions .",
    "these solutions represent a disconnected component labeled by one parameter , namely , the mass @xmath49 ( the magnetic charge @xmath50 is fixed to be unity ) .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec2 ] , the eym system possesses an energy scale given by the ym coupling constant , so in principle , non - zero values of @xmath230 are allowed . in the one - dimensional component corresponding to abelian magnetic solutions , the value of @xmath249 can be computed using ( [ 7.5 ] ) and ( [ 7.13 ] ) and is given by @xmath304 . )    finally , let us consider colored black holes .",
    "each connected component of the space of sss colored black holes is one - dimensional ( parameterized by @xmath61 ) , and solutions corresponding to distinct values of @xmath3 belong to disconnected components . that is , the space sss has a countable number of connected components . as we shall now show , for @xmath305 the value of the hamiltonian turns out to be _ different _ from zero : @xmath306 .",
    "recall that the general argument described above tells us that the ( on shell ) value of the hamiltonian is constant for each family labeled by @xmath3 .",
    "this in particular implies that its value is independent of the radius @xmath100 of the horizon .",
    "thus one is allowed to take the limit h^(n)=_r_0 [ m^(n)_adm ( r_)-m^(n)_(r _ ) ] .",
    "now , it is known that the colored black holes converge point - wise to the bartnik - mckinnon soliton solutions @xcite and that the adm mass satisfies @xmath307 when @xmath308 .",
    "furthermore , the horizon mass of the black hole @xmath210 goes to zero in this limit , so we can conclude that h^(n)=m^(n)_bk , that is , the total value of the hamiltonian equals the mass of the @xmath3th bartnik - mckinnon soliton solution !",
    "we now collect our results for colored black holes and arrive at the following unexpected relation , m^(n)_adm(r _ ) = m^(n)_bk + m^(n)_(r _ ) .",
    "thus , we are in the position of writing an explicit formula for the adm mass of the @xmath3 colored black hole as function of @xmath100 , m^(n)_adm(r _ ) = m^(n)_bk + _ 0^r _ ^(n ) ( ) . [ adm2 ] in figure  [ hormas ] , we show the values of the hhm as a function of the horizon radius @xmath100 , for the @xmath309 families .",
    "note that for a given value of the horizon area , the higher @xmath3 is , the lower the horizon mass of the corresponding black hole . in figure  [ magnetic ] the value of the horizon magnetic charge @xmath63",
    "is shown as function of the radius .",
    "it is important to stress that , a priori , one would not expect to get the value of quantities defined at infinity , like the difference of adm masses in terms of purely local quantities at @xmath65 . at this point",
    "one might raise the following objection to the construction of @xmath210 for colored black holes : if we start by considering the equation @xmath310 , and try to integrate it along the one - dimensional curve defined for each @xmath3 , one can  trivially \" do so by using the usual form of the first law at infinity , which tells us that the general solution for @xmath210 is given by @xmath311 , with @xmath145 a constant",
    ". then one might argue that the ` only ' thing one is doing is to set @xmath145 such that @xmath312 .",
    "thus , one would conclude , the derivation is trivial and even the notion of a horizon mass would seem questionable .",
    "this argument would be perfectly valid had we _ postulated _ the equation @xmath310 . however , the non - trivial point here is that this equation comes as a consequence ( and consistency requirement ) from a hamiltonian description respecting physically motivated boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , even when the algebraic manipulations are simple , the final result is highly non - trivial .    we can now try to understand the physical meaning of the relation ( [ adm2 ] ) .",
    "two facts are known about these solutions : first , we know that for fixed @xmath61 these solutions represent saddle points of the adm mass function @xmath49 @xcite , and thus , as one can expect , for all values of @xmath3 these solutions are unstable under small perturbations @xcite .",
    "let us now note that for the reported solutions in the literature ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , the bk mass is a monotonic function of @xmath3 , starting at @xmath313 and approaching @xmath314 as @xmath3 grows ( in standard normalized units ) .",
    "the fact that the mass of the soliton , and therefore the total energy of the colored black holes is positive , confirms our expectation , coming from energetic considerations , that in general @xmath315 .",
    "indeed , since the difference between the horizon and adm masses can be seen as the energy that is available for radiation to fall both into the black hole and to infinity , one can understand the nonzero value of the hamiltonian as an indication that there is a potentiality for instability of the solution .",
    "in static solutions there is , of course , no radiation .",
    "thus , to be precise , a positive value of the energy @xmath249 means that , if we perturb slightly the initial data of a ( unstable ) static solution in such a way that the total energy is ` very close ' to @xmath249 , then the resulting space - time will approach schwarzschild in the future , and the total radiated energy to both infinity and the horizon will be equal to @xmath249 . in conclusion ,",
    "a necessary condition for the solution to be unstable is for the value of the total energy on the solution in question to be positive .",
    "let us conclude this section with four remarks .    1 .   in the computation of the horizon mass for magnetically charged abelian solution",
    ", we required that the function @xmath220 vanishes for the extremal black holes .",
    "let us now motivate this choice .",
    "first , it is known that for @xmath316 , the @xmath3 colored black holes approach the reissner nordstrom magnetic solution ( in a region around the horizon that expands unboundly with @xmath3 ) when @xmath317 .",
    "let us abuse notation for a moment and refer to these limiting solution as the ` @xmath318 colored black hole ' . from the numerical solutions reported in the literature one can notice that the horizon mass @xmath319 tends to zero when @xmath317 and @xmath320 from above .",
    "now , if we require continuity from above for @xmath210 on the space @xmath122 of sss solutions , we should require that _ r_1^+ m^()_=0 .",
    "but the horizon mass is given by @xmath321 , and @xmath322 as @xmath320 ( since this corresponds to the extremal rn case ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath323 when @xmath320 .",
    "2 .   let us now return to the puzzle that we posed in section  [ sec2 ] : how can we reconcile the treatments of static solutions at infinity and at the horizon ? that is , when formulating the first law , say at infinity , we only have two free parameters given by the adm mass and electric charge @xmath324 .",
    "however , at the horizon we have three parameters , the horizon area @xmath61 , the electric charge @xmath62 and the magnetic charge @xmath63 .",
    "now , equation ( [ firstlaw ] ) tell us that their respective variations depend only on the horizon area and electric charge , which seems to be a contradiction .",
    "the proper setting of the problem again comes from the consistency of the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "recall that from equation ( [ cond1 ] ) we concluded that the magnetic charge @xmath63 is not free to vary at the horizon , but its variations are related to the variations of the horizon radius @xmath100 .",
    "this means that the allowed values of @xmath63 and @xmath100 lie in sub - manifolds of co - dimension one embedded in the space @xmath122 .",
    "thus , even when we can in principle have three independent parameters at the horizons , in practice when employing the hamiltonian formulation , one is restricted to values of the magnetic charge that are determined by the horizon area ( within each family labeled by @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , the variations of the parameters both at the horizon and at infinity are consistent .",
    "this can also be seen in the following way .",
    "the results of different formalisms at infinity have shown that the adm mass varies as @xcite , m_adm = a_+ _ q _ , [ 20 ] but since we know that , at a static solution , an arbitrary variation @xmath208 satisfies @xmath325 , we have complete agreement with ( [ firstlaw ] ) .",
    "+ now lets turn our view to the conflict that our completeness conjecture @xmath267 seems to face in view of the fact that the colored black hole solutions , with different value of @xmath3 , have different values of the hamiltonian and the general argument , presented in sec  [ sec6 ] , ensures that @xmath230 must be constant over any sub - manifold of static ( stationary ) solutions .",
    "thus , this general argument would lead us to conclude that @xmath230 is constant over @xmath1 .",
    "the solution of the apparent paradox lies in the fact , already mentioned in sec  [ sec6 ] that the consistency of the hamiltonian formulation leads to a foliation of phase space by symplectic leaves over which the hamiltonian formulation is valid .",
    "these leaves intersect the manifold of stationary configurations , which is embedded in @xmath2 .",
    "the intersection results in hyper - surfaces of constant value of the hamiltonian . in the case of sss",
    "each one of those corresponds to a single family labeled by a fixed value of @xmath3 .",
    "if we now restrict our consideration to the hyper - surface with @xmath326 each of these families correspond to a curve in the @xmath327 plane .",
    "namely , @xmath328 becomes a function of @xmath100 rather than an independent parameter .",
    "this again is similar to what happens in the case of a rotating body , where the manifold of stationary states does not correspond to a single value of the hamiltonian , but the intersection of a symplectic leave with this manifold coincides with the curves of constant value of the hamiltonian .",
    "then , even when the space @xmath122 if foliated by a ` continuum ' of leaves , the allowed hamiltonian motions are restricted to lie within each of these level surfaces of the hamiltonian @xmath230 .",
    "this overall picture of the structure of the parameter space is in fact , consistent with the situation in emd . in this case , there is only one ` leave ' and thus , the intersection with the manifold of static solutions has also only one leave ; the value of @xmath230 is indeed constant on the whole @xmath1 ( it is in fact zero ) . +",
    "it is intriguing to note that there seems to be a deep relation between the existence of non - trivial solitons and hairy black holes for which the charges are not independent ( i.e. , the possible sss solutions are restricted to a discrete set of constant energy surfaces within @xmath122 ) .",
    "the fact that the consistency requirement on the hamiltonian formulation leads to the ` nonstandard ' hamiltonian framework for these cases ( i.e the foliation of phase space by the ( symplectic ) leaves on which there is a truly hamiltonian framework ) together with the constancy of the full hamiltonian on stationary solutions can be regarded as explaining such relation .",
    "that is , on the intersection of each leave with the manifold @xmath1 of stationary solutions , the full hamiltonian is a constant . in the limit @xmath329 on each leave ( provided such limit",
    "can be taken ) we will find a soliton . the motion along the ` leave ' in @xmath1 determines the mutual dependence of the isolated horizon parameters .",
    "it is now a general belief that the no - hair conjecture , even in its weakest form @xcite , is violated for some systems .",
    "one can thus hope that there be a uniqueness result for static solutions in terms of quasi - local parameters at the horizon . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    "we have put forward a ` horizon parameters uniqueness conjecture ' stating that all static bh solutions are characterized by their horizons parameters ( ` quasi - local charges ' ) in a unique way . in particular",
    ", it should be true that , given the horizon area @xmath61 and the horizon electric charge @xmath62 and magnetic charge @xmath63 , the static solutions be uniquely determined .",
    "for instance , if we set @xmath62 , given an arbitrary value for the magnetic charge @xmath330 $ ] , there might be no solution , but if there is a solution , it should be unique .",
    "the numerical evidence available supports the conjecture ( see figure  [ magnetic ] ) .",
    "one other point already mentioned is the issue of the stability test provided by this type of analysis : it is only when @xmath331 in ( [ 7.5 ] ) that the solution can be unstable .",
    "one very clear example of this is given by the magnetic rn solution , which can be considered within both the einstein maxwell ( em ) theory and the eym theory .",
    "this solution is stable within em but unstable within eym @xcite .",
    "we can now understand this situation in the following way : in the former case the gauge connection can not be globally described through a gauge field @xmath332 as it corresponds to a nontrivial bundle . in this case",
    "one can nevertheless apply the ih formalism through the use of the duality symmetry of maxwell theory .",
    "this results in the appearance of a term @xmath333 taking the place of @xmath334 in ( [ smarr ] ) , and as it is well known the evaluation of @xmath249 as @xmath335 ( in this case @xmath336 as there are no abelian magnetically charged regular solitons ) gives @xmath337 , thus accounting for the stability of the solution .",
    "let s look at what happens in the eym theory . in this case",
    "the solution can be described in terms of the gauge fields @xmath338 because it is associated with a trivial bundle ( with larger group ) and there is therefore no term of the form @xmath333 in ( [ smarr ] ) .",
    "the @xmath63 dependence of the mass @xmath210 comes through @xmath220 .",
    "as we have shown , the value of @xmath249 for this solutions is positive ( @xmath339 ) , thus allowing for the instability of these solutions .",
    "note that this same argument is valid also for dyons with both electric and unit magnetic charge ( see equation ( [ 6.24 ] ) to ( [ 6.27 ] ) ) , and thus , it indicates a potential instability of these solutions .",
    "+ finally , let us conclude this remark by suggesting a ` rule of thumb ' for finding potentially unstable solutions , suggested by the eym system . in the static family of solutions , consider the limit @xmath257 .",
    "we have three possibilities : i ) we arrive at a regular solution with zero energy ( i.e. minkowski ) .",
    "this indicates that the whole family , labeled by @xmath100 , is stable ; ii ) there is a minimum allowed value of @xmath100 corresponding to zero surface gravity . in this case",
    ", we can not conclude anything , and ; iii ) in the limit one finds a regular solution with positive energy ( a soliton different from the vacuum ) . in this case",
    ", the whole family of solutions ( including the soliton ) is potentially unstable",
    ". it would be interesting to re - examine , from this perspective , the ( complete non - linear ) stability of the einstein - skyrme solitons and black holes @xcite .",
    "in this note , we have studied the extension of the isolated horizon formalism to include the eym system and found that it leads to a ` nonstandard ' hamiltonian formulation .",
    "the main feature of this formulation is that it provides a foliation of phase space into symplectic leaves in each of which we do get a standard hamiltonian formulation .",
    "the framework nevertheless provides a powerful tool for studying some classical aspects of the theory already at the static level .",
    "in particular , we found an unexpected relation between the the adm mass of a static spherically symmetric black hole solution , its horizon mass and the adm mass of the corresponding solitonic solution .",
    "these relationships were checked numerically in terms of the known numerical results obtained in the process of finding those solutions and thus the agreement can be seen as a check on the whole formalism .",
    "an apparent tension and a challenge for the formalism is given by the existence of hairy solutions , where the number of charges at infinity and at the horizon do not coincide .",
    "we have been able to pin - point the problem in a precise way using the isolated horizons formalism .",
    "this involves the analysis of the consistency of the hamiltonian formulation and the nature of the first law .",
    "we have encountered difficulties in defining a canonical normalization for the vector @xmath77 and thus , for the horizon mass in general . we have proposed possible resolutions for this difficulty .",
    "motivated by all these results , and in order to have a satisfactory treatment of the eym system within the framework , we have put forward a ` quasi - local uniqueness ' and a ` completeness ' conjectures for stationary black holes . in the case of the",
    "later we have put forward arguments both in favor and against it , but the main point is that some version of it seems to be the only possibility to have the isolated horizon framework working in eym theory to the same extent that it does in , say , einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "the present work can be generalized in several directions .",
    "first , our analysis allows us to propose a isolated horizon treatment for general theories containing non - trivial black holes and soliton solutions ; it should be possible to apply the type of analysis presented here to these theories where nontrivial regular static solutions have been found .",
    "in particular , einstein - yang - mills - higgs , einstein - yang - mills - dilaton , and einstein - skyrme theories , are examples in which there are both , solitonic and black hole solutions . in all these cases ,",
    "formulas analogous to the eym case can in principle be found by a straightforward application of the analysis carried out in the last section . in particular",
    ", one should be able to to compute the ` total energy ' of the ` hairy ' black holes to test for a potential instability .",
    "second , one can use the very recent results of ashtekar and collaborators who have been able to extend the isolated horizons framework to include _ distorted _ horizons @xcite as well as _ rotating _ horizons @xcite .",
    "thus , one should be able to use the formalism for distorted horizons in order to study colored black holes which are static but not spherically symmetric @xcite .",
    "this analysis would be a first check for the ` quasi - local uniqueness conjecture @xmath60 ' that we have proposed @xcite .",
    "the discussion of the preceding sections suggests that by restricting our attention to non - distorted , non - rotating horizons we were lead to a consistent but ` incomplete ' formalism in the eym system ; a complete treatment ( i.e. , one providing a canonical choice of ` normalization ' for all @xmath122 , based on stationary solutions which are contained in the formalism ) of eym isolated horizons should be given within the context of distorted and rotating isolated horizons @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate this matter once the articles @xcite are made public .",
    "finally , the present analysis shows that the so called colored black hole solutions provide a nontrivial testing ground for the approach of@xcite to evaluate the statistical mechanical entropy of black holes .",
    "in particular it is known that by selecting the value @xmath340 for the immirzi parameter @xmath341 , ( which amounts to selecting one among a continuous choice of unitarily inequivalent quantum theories corresponding to the same classical theory ) , the standard result @xmath342 is obtained for the einstein vacuum and einstein - maxwell case .",
    "it is worth to point out that this choice can be made only once , and that it is conceivable that say , the choice needed in the case of einstein - maxwell black holes might have been different than the choice needed for pure gravity black holes .",
    "now , it would be of interest to check whether these results are also valid when non - abelian gauge fields are present .",
