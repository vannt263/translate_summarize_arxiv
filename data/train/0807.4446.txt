    "good bounds for these entropy numbers , in particular the covering or the bracketing numbers , can , e.g. , be used to prove bounds on the expectations of suprema of empirical processes ( as , e.g. , dudley s metric entropy bound ) , concentration of measure results for these suprema , or to verify that a class @xmath6 of functions or sets is a glivenko - cantelli or donsker class , i.e. , that the corresponding @xmath6-indexed empirical process @xmath7 exhibits a certain convergence behavior as @xmath8 tends to infinity ( cf .",

    "if one substitutes the set system @xmath19 by , e.g. , the system of all @xmath2-dimensional axis - parallel boxes @xmath20\\}$ ] , one gets another measure of uniformity , the so - called extreme discrepancy @xmath21 certain types of discrepancy are intimately related to multivariate numerical integration of certain function classes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; a well - known result in this direction is the koksma - hlawka inequality which , written as an equality , reads @xmath22^d } f(x)\\,{\\rm d}x - \\frac{1}{n } \\sum^n_{i=1 } f(t_i ) \\right| = d^*_{\\infty}(t_1,\\ldots , t_n),\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the unit ball in some particular sobolev space of functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus for multivariate numerical integration it is desirable to be able to calculate the star discrepancy of a given point configuration @xmath24 , to have ( useful ) bounds on the smallest possible discrepancy of any @xmath8-point set , and to be able to construct sets satisfying such bounds .",
