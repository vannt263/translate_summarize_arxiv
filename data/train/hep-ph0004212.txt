    "nowadays , there are no doubts the model of qcd vacuum as the instanton liquid ( il ) is the most practical instrument on the chiral scale of qcd .",
    "it provides , as the lattice calculations recently confirmed , not only the theoretical background for describing spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( scsb ) but is mostly powerful in the phenomenology of the qcd vacuum and in the physics of light quarks while considered to propagate by zero modes arising from instantons .",
    "the origin of gluon and chiral condensates turns out in this picture easily understandable and both are quantitatively calculated getting very realistic values defined by @xmath0 and parameters of instanton and anti - instanton ensemble , for example , @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the scale for dynamical quark masses , @xmath2 , naturally appears and pion decay constant , @xmath3 , is then transparently calculated .",
    "another significant advantage of this approach is that the initial formulation starts basically from the first principles and subsequent approximations being well grounded and reliably controlled are plugged in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it becomes clear especially in recent years when the impressive progress has been reached in understanding the instanton physics on the lattice @xcite .",
    "further we are summarizing several things we have learned thinking of the il theory and trying to answer the challenging questions .",
    "let us start on that stage of the il approach when its generating functional has already been factorized as @xmath4 where eventually the factor @xmath5 provides nontrivial gluon condensate while the fermion part @xmath6 is responsible to describe the chiral condensate in instanton medium and its excitations .",
    "it is usually supposed the functional integral of @xmath5 is saturated by the superposition of the pseudo - particle ( pp ) fields which are the euclidean solutions of the yang - mills equations called the ( anti-)instantons @xmath7 here @xmath8 denotes the field of a single ( anti-)instanton in singular gauge with @xmath9 ( for the @xmath10 group ) coordinates @xmath11 of size @xmath12 centred at the coordinate @xmath13 and colour orientation defined by the matrix @xmath14 .",
    "the nontrivial bloc of corresponding @xmath15 matrices of pp is a part of potential @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the pauli matrices , @xmath18 is the t hooft symbol @xcite , @xmath19 is the coupling constant and for anti - instanton @xmath20 . for the sake of simplicity we do not introduce the distinct symbols for instanton ( @xmath21 ) and anti - instanton ( @xmath22 ) and consider topologically neutral il with @xmath23 . formulating the variational principle the practical estimate of @xmath5 was found @xcite @xmath24 with the action of il defined by the following additive functional ) looks like a formula of classical physics although it describes the ground state of quantum instanton ensemble .",
    "intuitively clear , this definition will be still valid even when the wave function is nonhomogeneous with the nonuniformity scale essentially exceeding average instanton size or , precisely speaking , being larger ( or of the order ) than average size of characteristic saturating field configuration .",
    "then each instanton liquid element of such a distinctive size will provide a partial contribution depending on the current state of il , see next section . ] @xmath25 the integration should be performed over the il volume @xmath26 along with averaging the action per one instanton @xmath27 weighted with instanton size distribution function @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the number of flavours .",
    "the constant @xmath32 is defined by the variational maximum principle in the selfconsistent way and @xmath33 with constant @xmath34 depending on the renormalization scheme , in particular , here @xmath35 .",
    "the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 are fixed at the characteristic scale @xmath38 ( an average instanton size ) .",
    "the constant @xmath39 characterizes , in a sense , the pp interaction and eqs .",
    "( [ s]),([si ] ) and ( [ nrho ] ) describe the equilibrium state of il .",
    "the minor modification of variational maximum principle ( see appendix ) leads to the explicit form of the mean instanton size @xmath40 and , therefore , to the direct definition of the il parameters unlike the conventional variational principle @xcite which allows one to extract those parameters solving numerically the transcendental equation only .",
    "the quark fields are considered to be _ influenced _ by the certain stochastic ensemble of pps , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , while calculating the quark determinant @xmath41 besides , dealing with the dilute il ( small characteristic packing fraction parameter @xmath42 ) one neglects the correlations between pps and utilizes the approximation of @xmath43 where the planar diagrams only survive .",
    "in addition the fermion field action is approached by the zero modes which are the solutions of the dirac equation @xmath44 in the field of ( anti-)instanton @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46_{ic}={\\frac{\\textstyle \\rho}{\\textstyle \\sqrt{2}\\pi |x|(x^2+\\rho^2)^{3/2 } } } \\left[\\hat x~{\\frac{\\textstyle 1\\pm\\gamma_5}{\\textstyle 2}}\\right]_{ij}\\varepsilon_{jd } ~u_{dc}\\ ] ] with the colour @xmath47 and the lorentz @xmath48 indices and the antisymmetric tensor @xmath49 . in particular , at @xmath50 the quark determinant reads @xcite @xmath51 @xmath52 where the factor @xmath53 makes the result dimensionless and is also fixed by the saddle point calculation . much more accurate result for the green function of quark in the pp ensemble @xcite allows one to calculate the generating functional even beyond the chiral limit and the simple zero mode approximation turns out amazingly fruitful again to develop ( quantitatively ) the low energy phenomenology of light quarks @xcite .",
    "thus , the il approach at the present stage of its development looks very indicative , well theoretically grounded and reasonably adjusted phenomenologically .",
    "the proper form of generating functional obtained and its reasonable parameter dependence provide with enough predictive power and justify , hence , the approximations made .",
    "generally , it leads to conclude the quark feedback upon the instanton background is pretty limp and could be perturbatively incorporated as a small variation of instanton liquid parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 around their equilibrium values of @xmath56 and @xmath38 being in full analogy with the description of chiral condensate excitations .",
    "indeed , the result of nontrivial calculation of the functional integral ( treating the zero quark modes in the fermion determinant substantially from physical view point ) takes down to encoding the il state with just those two parameters .",
    "moreover , the il density appears in the approach via the packing fraction parameter @xmath57 only ( clear from dimensional analysis ) what means one independent parameter existing in practice .",
    "it is just the instanton size .",
    "the analysis of the _ quark and il interaction _ is addressed in this paper developing our idea @xcite of phononlike excitations of il resulting from the adiabatic changes of the instanton size .",
    "hence , we describe further the _ quark feedback _ dealing with these deformable ( anti-)instanton configurations which are the field configurations eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) characterized by the size @xmath12 depending on @xmath58 and @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the modification of quark determinant when the functional integral is saturated by the deformable modes at one flavour .",
    "then in section iii we develop the proper calculation ( tadpole approximation ) which is based on the saddle point method .",
    "section iv is devoted to the generalization for the multiflavour picture .",
    "the paper includes also appendix where the fault finding reader gets a chance to control the explicit formulae for the il parameters and to improve our calculations if is able .",
    "apparently , the essence of what we discuss here could be illuminated in the following way . saddle point method calculation of the functional integral implies the treatment of the action extremals which are the solutions of classical field equations . for the case in hands",
    "the action @xmath60 $ ] is constructed including the gluon fields @xmath61 , ( anti-)quarks @xmath62 and extremals which are given by the solutions of the consistent system of the yang - mills and dirac equations . as a trial configuration in the il theory the superposition of ( anti-)instantons which is the approximate solution of the yang - mills equations ( with no backreaction of the quark fields ) and a background field for the dirac equation is simultaneously considered .",
    "we believe it is reasonable to make use the deformable ( crumpled ) ( anti-)instantons @xmath63 as the saturating configurations .",
    "they just admit of varying the parameters @xmath64 of the yang - mills sector of the initial consistent system in order to describe the influence of quark fields in the appropriate variables for the quark determinant .    taking the action in the form",
    "@xmath65 $ ] we would receive the corresponding variational equation for the deformation field @xmath64 which approaches most optimally ( as to the action extremum ) pp at nonzero quark fields . in the field theory , for example ,",
    "the monopole scattering @xcite , the abrikosov vortices scattering @xcite are treated in a similar way .",
    "actually , the unstationary picture seems more adequate as a specific role of instanton - anti - instanton annihilation channel prompts and an investigation of two - body colour problem teaches @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "for il we avoid the difficulties which come with solving the variational equations if we consider the long wavelength excitations only ( with the wave length @xmath66 much larger than the characteristic instanton size @xmath38 ) .",
    "indeed , it can be done because we are searching the kinetic energy of the deformation fields   ( the one particle contributions ) and consider the pair interaction which develops the contact interaction form being calculated in the adiabatic regime @xcite .",
    "let us remember here that deriving eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) we should average over the instanton positions in a metric space .",
    "clearly , the characteristic size of the domain @xmath67 which has to be taken into account should exceed the mean instanton size @xmath38 .",
    "but at the same time it should not be too large because the far ranged elements of il are not causally related .",
    "the ensemble wave function is expected to be homogeneous ( every pp contributes to the functional integral being weighted with a factor proportional to @xmath68 ) on this scale .",
    "the characteristic configuration which saturates the functional integral is taken as the superposition eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath69 number of pp in the volume @xmath26 .",
    "it is easy to understand that because of an additivity of the functional , eq.([s ] ) describes properly even non - equilibrium states of il when the distribution function @xmath70 does not coincide with the vacuum one and , moreover , allows us to generalize this action for the non - homogeneous liquid when the size of the homogeneity obeys the obvious requirement @xmath71 . in particular",
    ", the ensemble of deformable pps as saturating the functional integral obeys these constraints if the corrections coming with the deformation fields @xmath72 are small and the long wavelength excitations ( on the scale of the instanton size @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath73 ) of initial instanton fields @xmath74 are mainly taken into consideration .",
    "such a condition of smoothness or the adiabatic change of instanton size dictates , in practice , another essential simplification to define the field in the center of instanton @xmath75 as a characteristic deformation field in further calculations .    in principle , the correction to the instanton field produced by the quark presence might be calculated in its most general form , if the gluon green function in the instanton medium is known , as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the current of external quark source , @xmath78 belongs to the region of long wavelength disturbance and , at last , @xmath79 is the green function of pp in the instanton medium . in fact , this green function ( even when considered in the field of one instanton ) is not well defined @xcite but , seems , for the case in hands we could develop the selfconsistent way to calculate the regularized green function .",
    "the nonsingular propagator behaviour in the soft momentum region is defined by the mass gap of phononlike excitations .",
    "fortunately , the exact form of the green function occurs to be not of great importance here ( we are planning to return to the problem of regularized green function calculation in the forthcoming publication ) . in the coordinate space",
    "it is peaked around the average pp size being in nonperturbative regime and , hence , integral eq .",
    "( [ ggf ] ) is estimated to be @xmath80 on the other hand , the exact instanton definition in the singular gauge , @xmath81 leads to the following correction to the instanton potential @xmath82 where @xmath83 . confining within the precision accepted here we could take @xmath84 , i.e. @xmath85 .",
    "if we compare now both definitions of the correction we are capable to get immediately for @xmath86 the following equation @xmath87 in fact , the current @xmath88 might be taken constant in the long wavelength approximation . then neglecting the current gradients one",
    "is allowed to change the derivatives to obtain the following estimate of the deformation velocity @xmath89 which looks to be well justified since there is no other fields in the problem at all ( in the adiabatic approximation ) . the contribution of deformed ( anti-)instantons to the functional integral ( when the corrections coming from the pp deformation fields are absorbed )",
    "may be estimated as @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the kinetic coefficient being derived within the quasiclassical approach .",
    "our estimate of it gives the value of a few single instanton actions @xmath92 with the coefficient @xmath93 depending quantitatively on the ansatz supposed for the saturating configurations .",
    "although this estimate is not much meaningful because there is no the vital @xmath91 dependence eventually ( becomes shortly clear ) and the kinetic term could be introduced phenomenologically .",
    "thus , this coefficient should be fixed on a characteristic scale , for example @xmath94 , if we not are planning to be beyond the precision peculiar to the approach .",
    "actually , it means adding the small contribution of kinetic energy type to the action per one instanton only .",
    "such a term results from the scalar field of deformations and affects negligibly the pre - exponential factors of the functional integral . in one s turn the pre - exponential factors do the negligible influence on the kinetic term as well .",
    "the deformation fields induced by the dilations and rotations in the isotopic space result in the singular and trivial kinetic coefficients , respectively @xcite .",
    "then to evaluate the mass scale related to those modes one needs the heuristic ideas rooted , apparently , beyond the conventional il and scsb .",
    "if we strive for being within the approximation developed we should retain the small terms of the second order in deviation from the point of action minimum @xmath95 only expecting the approximate validity of @xmath96 where @xmath97 and the scalar field @xmath98 is the field of deviations from the equilibrium value of @xmath99 .",
    "consequently , the deformation field is described by the following lagrangian density @xmath100 with the mass gap of the phononlike excitations @xmath101 which is estimated for il with @xmath102 , for example , in the quenched approximation to be @xmath103 if @xmath104 ( for the details see the tables of appendix ) .",
    "changing the variables we obtain the gluon part of the generating functional as @xmath105\\right\\}~,\\ ] ] with the jacobian @xmath106 corresponding those new variables introduced .",
    "let us notice that the latter looks pretty formal because of incomplete set of the transformations shown .",
    "however , in the adiabatic approximation , as was mentioned above , the preexponentional jacobian contribution to the action   and integration variable @xmath107 ( [ pop ] ) are related via the rotation matrix : @xmath108 and in the long - length wave approximation @xmath109 might be constant @xmath110(@xmath111 ) . with the rotation matrix spanning the colour field @xmath112 on the fixed axis we can conclude that the vectors @xmath113 and @xmath86 are , in fact , in one to one correspondence ( of course , being within one loop approximation and up to this unessential colour rotation ) .",
    "thus , the jacobian contribution turns out to be an unessential constant . ] being a c - number should be omitted .    analyzing the modifications which arise now in the quark determinant @xmath114 we take into account the variation of fermion zero modes resulting from the instanton size perturbed @xmath115 where @xmath116 and because of the adiabaticity it is valid @xmath117 @xmath118 .",
    "the additional contributions of scalar field generate the corresponding corrections in the factors of the kernels @xmath119 of eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) which are treated in the linear approximation in @xmath120 and taking  approximately @xmath121 , i.e. @xmath122 here we introduced the notations @xmath123 @xmath124 with @xmath125 left acting operator ( the gradients of scalar field @xmath120 are negligible according to the adiabaticity assumption again ) .",
    "it is a simple matter to verify that the right hand side of eq .",

    "it is pertinent to mention here the diakonov - petrov result comes to the play precisely if the scalar field is switched off .    in order to avoid a lot of the needless coefficients in the further formulae we introduce the dimensionless variables ( momenta , masses and vertices ) @xmath133 the fields in turn @xmath134 and eventually for @xmath66 we are using @xmath135 .",

    "the functional obtained describes the il state influenced by the quarks when all the terms containing the scalar field are collected ( see also appendix ) .",

    "characterizes the il reaction on the external long - length wave perturbation and , apparently , is its general feature independent of perturbating field nature .",
    "the presence of quark condensate makes hint for the appropriate scheme of approximate calculation of the generating functional @xmath138",
    "the formal integration over the scalar field leads us to the four fermion interaction and the functional integral can not be calculated exactly . however , due to smallness of scalar field corrections we may find the effective lagrangian substituting the condensate value in lieu of one of the pairs of quark lines ( see fig .",
