    "the large - scale structure of the universe as observed in redshift surveys displays a complicated geometry .",
    "this complex structure referred to as the `` cosmic web '' , is characterized by the presence of clusters , filaments , sheets and voids .",
    "more than 30 years ago galaxy surveys found evidence of filaments @xcite and analyses of modern surveys find hundreds of filaments and pancakes @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations complement the obserations , and find that sheets ( which include walls and pancakes ) may occupy over half of the volume @xcite .",
    "the structure of the cosmic web is the result of the gravitational growth of the small amplitude primordial density and velocity perturbations .",
    "first suggested the anisotropic nature of gravitational collapse leading to zeldovich pancakes , which are formed when an overdense region collapses first along one of its principal axes .",
    "the pancake picture was further developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "various papers have simulated zeldovich pancakes under controlled conditions @xcite which typically involve simulations of particles only along a fixed axis perpendicular to the pancake .    the dynamics of pancakes has been studied extensively with large numerical @xmath0body simulations , where pancakes have been observed over the last almost 20 years @xcite .",
    "the dynamical importance of these sheets , expressed through the mass fraction of sheets in the cosmic web is rather uncertain , and varies in the range @xmath1 , while the volume fraction varies from @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "there are several ways of defining whether a structure in the cosmic web is a filament , sheet , void or halo .",
    "often , structures are differentiated on the basis of eigenvalues of the second derivative of the tidal tensor @xmath3 , for a sheet @xmath3 has only one positive eigenvalue . alternatively the sheets can be defined through the shear tensor , which is a rescaled derivative of the velocity field .",
    "@xcite . in recent studies ,",
    "the entire 6 dimensional phase space information is taken into account for recognizing structures @xcite .",
    "direct observations of pancakes is extremely difficult whereas identifying halos is straight forward .",
    "this is due to their planar nature and their low contrast with the background @xcite .",
    "generally , there is a non uniform mass distribution along the area of the sheet , since most of the sheet mass is located in a few very massive regions whereas many of the remaining regions have very low density with no massive halos in them .",
    "observations of high - density regions in galaxy observations were pioneered 60 years ago @xcite , and have today led to the detection of hundreds of sheets @xcite .",
    "all these sheets are , however , based on overdensities in phase - space only , and it has still not been clearly established to which extent the sheets have infact collapsed along the one dimension only .",
    "this is one of the concerns of the present paper , to consider whether such overdensities in phase - space are indeed sheets .",
    "recently it was shown , that certain pancakes may be useful as tools to measure the mass of massive galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "these pancakes are positioned at 3 - 10 virial radii from the cluster .",
    "the cluster mass is measured by considering the small perturbation to the hubble flow , which the galaxy cluster will induce on the observable line of sight velocity of the galaxies in the pancake .",
    "one thing missing in this analysis is , however , to confirm that the structures used are indeed pancakes . in this paper",
    "we will confirm that this is indeed the case .",
    "another aspect of pancakes are their density profile perpendicular to the pancake . in the papers",
    "@xcite it was shown that cold collapse leads to final equilibria that are close to a universal power - law density profile , with an exponent less than 1/2 .",
    "here we have compared the power law density profile for the sheet observed in a cosmological simulation , and we find that the theoretical prediction are in fair agreement with the result from the cosmological simulation , however , with a slightly more shallow central profile .",
    "observationally , when a pancake is seen face - on , it is not possible to extract the density profile .",
    "however , we derive an equivalent to the eddington method @xcite in one dimension , which in principle may allow one to extract information about the line of sight density profile , by using the observable distribution of velocities .",
    "in order to consider the equilibration level of a pancake , we need to extract a real pancake from a cosmological simulation . a series of recent papers @xcite developed powerful cosmological simulation techniques to analyze the evolution of dark matter sheet . in this paper , we have analysed the sheet at a fixed redshift , @xmath4 .",
    "we consider a few of the pancakes used in @xcite , which are based on the n - body simulation described there ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "these pancakes were used to demonstrate a new method of measuring the cluster mass , but it was not quantified if these were truly sheets ( equilibrated along only one dimension ) or instead filaments ( equilibrated along two dimensions ) .",
    "the reason for considering these particular pancakes is that they have been found through a detection method , which will work on directly observable data . as observational quantities one uses only the two - dimensional position on the sky and the line of sight velocity . here",
    "we will , however , analyze these structures using all the information available from the numerical simulation .",
    "the pancakes are pointing almost radially from a large galaxy cluster , and lie at a distance of the order 10 - 40 mpc from the cluster .",
    "the pancakes are extracted by considering a slice on the sky ( @xmath5 ) , and then looking for overdensities in the phase - space of projected radius and line of sight velocity , ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "a sheet produces an almost straight line in that space .    in figure  [ fig:1b.every5 ]",
    "we show the phase - space plot for the cluster and the extracted sheet .",
    "the cluster is a ( normal ) dense collection of galaxies at projected radii smaller than 2 mpc , whereas the sheet forms a dense , and fairly narrow strip at projected distances between 6 and 16 mpc .",
    "the velocities are centered at the cluster , and the sheet particles have projected velocities between 500 and 2500 km / sec . only every 5th point is plotted .",
    "now , having these sheets , we can rotate them according to their major axes ( x , y , z ) , in such a way that x is an axis along the longest axis of the sheet , and z is an axis along the shortest axis .",
    "the latter axis , z , thus corresponds to the direction perpendicular to the sheet , namely the direction where we anticipate that the collapse has already happened .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig:2b.every5 ] where we show the real - space projection of the sheet .",
    "the x - axis is the distance from the cluster , and we see that the sheet sits in real space at a distance between 10 and 30 mpc from the cluster . visually we clearly see , that the sheet is very uniform and broad in the non - collapsed dimension ( y , upper panel ) , whereas it is much more compact and dense in the collapsed dimension ( z , lower panel ) .        as a first test , we compare the density profiles along these directions .",
    "we confirm that the profile along the z - direction does appear fairly `` _ _ gaussian _ _ '' , whereas the profiles along the other directions ( which are expected to not have collapsed yet ) are still fairly top - hat shaped , in agreement with the similar findings of @xcite .",
    "we also need a selection of galaxies to compare with , a background . for",
    "that we consider the same slice on the sky as the signal , however , for the velocity we extract the region with the opposite sign .",
    "this means that if the sheet is positioned beyond the cluster ( with positive line of sight velocity ) , then the background is selected as the symmetric region , but in front of the cluster ( with negative line of sight velocities ) .",
    "the largest sheet is not a homogeneous box , so we divide it into 10 radial bins ( each bin containing equal number of particles ) along the x ( radial ) direction , and the bins are numbered in ascending order of their distance from the cluster .",
    "we discard the extreme bins ( 1 and 10 ) .",
    "this may in particular allow us to consider different levels of virialization as a function of distance from the cluster .",
    "similar binning is performed in the background region .",
    "we have analysed another two sheets from the numerical simulation .",
    "their properties are qualitatively similar to the sheet discussed in this paper , however , because of a lower number of particles in those sheets , no additional interesting lessons were learned from them .",
    "the structure of phase space along different axes can be used to understand the level of equilibration along the particular axes of the structure . for",
    "a structure which has reached equilibrium in all the three directions , a phase space plot in any direction will show a semi - gaussian blob . on the contrary , for a structure which remains non - equilibrated along a particular direction",
    ", the hubble flow would completely dominate over the gravitational attraction , and its phase space plot along that direction will show a straight line corresponding to the hubble expansion .",
    "phase space plots for one of the radial bins of the largest sheet are shown in figure ( [ fig : phase_space_complete ] ) along with the phase space plots for the background region along the three axes .",
    "first of all , the background region ( lower panels ) is clearly seen to follow the hubble expansion fairly accurately along all 3 directions .",
    "instead , the signal region ( upper panels ) clearly shows variation from almost following the hubble flow ( x - direction , right - most panel ) to almost being completely equilibrated ( z - direction , left - most panel ) .",
    "the y - direction is in the early stage of equilibration , only starting to depart from the hubble flow .",
    "we therefore see , that the sheet candidate indeed is a real 2 dimensional sheet , and therefore differs from a filament , which should be collapsed along 2 dimensions .    a similar analysis for the other radial bins",
    "indicate , that the outer bins ( 6 - 9 ) are all in a state which have collapsed along only one dimension , whereas the innermost bins ( 2 - 5 ) are in a more advance state , where either the equilibration has happened along 2 dimensions for some bins , or the presence of substructure is more pronounced .",
    "this effect can also be observed by looking at the surface mass density values for the outermost bins(6 - 9 ) being ( 0.2625 to 0.39375 ) @xmath7 which is lower than the density of innermost bins(2 - 5 ) which is ( 0.4375 to 0.875 ) @xmath7 .",
    "we will therefore limit our analysis to the outermost bins ( 6 - 9 ) for the rest of this paper .",
    "in this section we will consider some additional aspects of the phase space plots along the x , y , z directions .",
    "considering their dynamic behaviour , the simple hubble motion of the galaxies is perturbed by the gravitational effect of the cluster mass and the gravitational field of the sheet itself .",
    "thus the total velocity of each paticle ( galaxy ) is the combination of two terms @xmath8 which are the pure hubble flow and an infall term @xmath9 .",
    "we remind that we have rotated the sheet in such a way , that the x - direction points radially out from the cluster .",
    "considering the motion along the radial x - direction , the corresponding infall term @xmath10 is governed by the gravitational force of the massive nearby cluster ( which naturally acts only in the x - direction ) , and the contribution from the mass of the sheet can be neglected as a first approximation . outside the region where the hubble flow starts to dominate , namely outside 3 - 4 times the virial radius @xcite",
    ", the infall term can be approximated to be @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the virial radius and @xmath13 is an appropriate constant ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath14 will give the slight deviation from the linear hubble flow in the slope of the phase space plots in the x - direction for both the sheet and the background regions , seen in the right - most panels in figure [ fig : phase_space_complete ] .",
    "for the y - direction , the sheet has just started to equilibrate , so , deviation caused by the mass of the sheet itself will be small compared to the hubble flow , as seen in the middle panel for the sheet .    if we subtract the hubble flow from the velocity of each particle we obtain the phase space figure ( [ fig : bin7_parts ] ) for the radial bin 7 .",
    "this phase - space plot of the perpendicular direction shows the essentially equilibrated central part , and 2 streams of galaxies in the process of falling into the sheet . each radial bin in the sheet seems to have collapsed into a nearly equilibrated elliptical part and two streams of infalling galaxies which are not part of the virialized structure .",
    "we emphasize that only directly observational data was used to identify the sheets ( 2 position in projected space , and the line of sight velocity ) , whereas we now , subsequently , consider the full detail of all of phase - space .    by removing the particles in the two streams",
    ", we can get the density profile of the equilibrated structure as a function of distance from the center .",
    "the profiles are somewhat noisy due to substructures which are not fully equilibrated .",
    "the structure of the equilibrated elliptical part in the plots is similar to the plots derived from one dimensional simulations in the paper @xcite .",
    "this is shown in figure ( [ fig : tremaine_comparison ] ) .",
    "we have also plotted a smooth function given by @xmath15 as a fit to the curve . from the fitting curve",
    "we find that @xmath16 .",
    "this can be compared to various analytical predictions : @xmath17 in the paper @xcite and @xmath18 in @xcite .",
    "is plotted for the radial bins numbered 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the blue fitting curve shows the model in equation ( [ eqn : fitting_function ] ) with the value of @xmath19      the streams in figure ( [ fig : bin7_parts ] ) can be compared to the stages of early equilibration as described in the papers @xcite .",
    "the potential energy of the sheet can be calculated from the density profile using equation ( [ eqn : poisson_equation ] ) . to make a better estimation of the potential energy profile , at distances away from its center ,",
    "we have taken into account the approximations to be made for a _",
    "finite _ sheet .",
    "thus , we have estimated the total energy ( @xmath20 ) of the infalling particles by comparing the change in kinetic energy of the particles in the 2 streams with the profile of potential energy due to the sheet itself .",
    "energy conservation holds as long as the potential is stable in time .",
    "such a constant total energy curve is given in figure ( [ fig : energy fit ] ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of particles in both in + z and -z streams are compared with the constant total energy curve .",
    "the galaxies in the + z stream follow this prediction very accurately .",
    "the stream on the other side of the sheet clearly has a component of particles ( galaxies ) which do not follow this simple behaviour .",
    "these particles are at distances 1 - 3 mpc from the sheet , and have an additional energy of approximately 150 km / sec . in figure 4",
    "we see that these are more dense particles , with a non - zero velocity dispersion .",
    "a potential origin of this discrepancy may be related to the non - equilibrated substructures , which are mainly seen in the -z direction , implying that the -z stream galaxies could be in a peculiar stage in the equilibration process rather than in a completely free fall motion .     of bin 7",
    "are plotted .",
    "the fitting function has been derived from the density profile of this bin . ]",
    "in this section , we derive an equivalent of the eddington model @xcite for its application on isotropic sheets with an infinite area .",
    "we shall consider self - consistent systems in which the density distribution determines the potential through poisson s equation , and the potential must also determine the density consistently through the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "as we will see , an equivalent of the eddington model for 3 dimensions can be used approximately for sheets along their perpendicular direction ( z- axis ) .",
    "these sheets are assumed to have uniform spatial distribution along the x - y plane and to be completely equilibrated along the z - axis .",
    "the change in gravitational potential or the total energy of galaxies along x and y axis is considered to be negligible as compared to their change along z axis .",
    "thus we consider only the z axis values of potential and total energy of the galaxies for our analysis .",
    "we define the relative potential @xmath21 , and the relative energy @xmath22 of a galaxy by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant such that the conditions @xmath25 for @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for @xmath28 are satisfied .",
    "we can now derive a unique ergodic distibution function ( df ) as a function of relative energy @xmath29 from the given density profile of the sheet @xmath30 with an infinite extension in the x- and y- direction as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the relative potential .",
    "the derivation is shown in detail in appendix-([apdx1 ] ) , and this result is similar to @xcite .    we can obtain the velocity distribution function @xmath33 along the line of sight , by integrating @xmath34 as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is computed such that @xmath26 is always valid .",
    "@xmath33 is directly observable , and hence this model can in principle be used to extract the density profiles of sheets from the observation of the line of sight velocities of the galaxies belonging to the sheet , even though this practically may never be possible .",
    "let us first consider a few simple and analytical models .",
    "we will here assume a known density profile for a sheet and calculate the associated phase space distribution function and velocity distribution function , @xmath33 , using equation ( [ eqn : eddington_1d ] ) .",
    "the spirit behind this analysis is that direct observations of the sheets give us their velocity distribution function and surface density ( @xmath37 ) only .",
    "the detailed properties of the vdf of the sheets , obtained from the observations , can then be compared to the computed profiles which have the same surface density ( @xmath37 ) and from it the density profile could be deduced .",
    "the analysis in this section is done for idealized sheets with infinite area .",
    "first a sheet with a density profile , which is often used in the simulations of the galaxy discs , is examined @xmath38 the scale length of the sheet is a , and the value of surface density @xmath37 is normalized such that @xmath39 .    by using equation ( [ eqn : eddington_1d ] ) , the phase space distribution function is - @xmath40    here ` erf ' represents the error function and @xmath41,@xmath42 are normalization constants .",
    "the derivation and the approximations involved in calculating @xmath37 are given in the appendix-([apdx2 ] ) . in order to derive the velocity distribution function .",
    "@xmath43    where @xmath44 is the constant for normalization , we substitute    @xmath45    the definite integral can be computed to get the distribution of velocities .",
    "the resulting profile obtained is shown in figure ( [ fig : sech_vdf ] ) for different values of @xmath46 .    ) for different values of constant @xmath46 .",
    "the value of mass per unit area @xmath47 is kept constant for all the curves . ]      another density profile with convenient analytical properties is @xmath48 the scale length of the sheet is @xmath46 and it s surface density is ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the equation for the relative potential becomes @xmath49    similar to the previous example , the value of surface density ( @xmath37 ) is considered such that @xmath39 .",
    "the phase space distributions function for two values of @xmath46 are given below .",
    "@xmath50      @xmath51    ) for different values of constant @xmath46 .",
    "the value of mass per unit area @xmath47 is kept constant for all the curves . ]",
    "further , the velocity distribution profile can be obtained by direct integration and resulting profiles obtained are shown in figure ( [ fig : power_law_vdf ] ) .",
    "to 80 mm    in this section we will present a comparison between the derived eddington model given by the equation ( [ eqn : eddington_1d ] ) on the simulated cdm sheet described earlier section .",
    "we will apply the eddington formula separately on the 7th , 8th & 9th radial bins of the largest sheet and compare to the analytically calculated velocity distribution curves with the observed vdfs for each of the bins .",
    "the calculation is quite tedious due to various approximations and complicated functions are involved in it .",
    "first of all , for the density distribution along the perpendicular axis of the sheet , we will estimate the best - fit parameters for the symmetric analytical model presented in section ( [ isothermal_sheet ] ) . in this step , we have ignored the anisotropies present in the sheet along its perpendicular direction ( z - axis ) .",
    "the gravitational potential function of the sheet is then calculated from the density distribution using the poisson s equation ( [ eqn : poisson_equation ] ) . in this analysis",
    ", we are dealing with particles with z coordinates less than the dimensions of the sheet in the xy plane so we can perform the potential energy calculations similar to the simplified calculation for a sheet of infinite area .    for eddington formula to be applicable , a structure",
    "must be completely equilibrated so that the ergodic hypothesis is valid",
    ". the radial bins of the sheet are divided into structures as discussed in section [ phase_space_structure ] .    to make a proper comparison between calculated and observed vdfs",
    ", we will take into consideration only the particles which lie in equilibrated regions of the sheet for plotting the observed vdf and we will neglect the particles lying in the infalling streams . using these particles , we can also fix an appropriate value to the width ( @xmath36 ) of the sheet which is an input parameter needed for performing the integration in equation ( [ eqn : sech_p(v ) ] ) .",
    "the computed and observed total velocity distribution curves for each of the bins 7,8,9 are compared separately in the figure ( [ fig : application - eddington ] ) .",
    "the constraints on @xmath52 can be used to roughly calculate @xmath53 which turns out to be almost @xmath54 in these cases .",
    "these curves can be observed to be similar within an order of magnitude .",
    "the discrepancies between the calculated and observed vdfs can be attributed to the various approximations which are elaborated in this section .",
    "zeldovich pancakes are cosmological structures which have collapsed and equilibrated only along the one dimension .",
    "these pancakes can be identified at redshift zero using only observational parameters and have recently received renewed interest , since they can be used to measure cluster masses .",
    "we consider the phase - space properties of pancakes from a cosmological numerical simulation , which were detected using the observational technique .",
    "we demonstrate how these objects are in the process of equilibrating mainly along the one dimension , and are much less equilibrated along the other two .",
    "we extract the density profiles of these structures , and we find fair agreement with theoretical predictions .",
