    "in his 1704 treatise _ opticks _ newton claimed that light is composed of particles , but also introduced waves to explain the diffraction phenomena . later on in classical maxwellian electrodynamics the wave approach seemed to be sufficient . yet , 201 year after newton , during his _ annus mirabilis _ albert einstein re - introduced _ lichtquanten _",
    "( light particles ) and explained the photoelectric effect ( einstein , 1905 ) .",
    "the final theory , in which photons are elementary excitations of the quantized electromagnetic field interacting with charges , was given by dirac ( 1927 ) , and its internal consistency was proved by dyson , feynman , schwinger and tonomaga around twenty years later .",
    "photons , as all quantum particles , reveal both wave - like and particle - like properties  a phenomenon known as wave - particle duality .",
    "the wave nature is revealed by interference , while the particle nature in detection events .",
    "the interference involving single photons , except from the discrete detection events ( which could possibly be thought as due to discrete ionization events ) , does not reveal any non - classical phenomena .",
    "the real quantum effects begin with two or more photon interference : a plethora of classically impossible phenomena occurs  most of them completely incomprehensible with any classical concepts . as",
    "always in the history of human scientific endeavor , harnessing of new phenomena leads to applications .",
    "the aim of this review is to describe the magic beauty of multiphoton manipulation , and its applications in amazing quantum protocols of communication , and even computation .",
    "an intensive research of the quantum properties of light started around half a century ago .",
    "its advances allow one to gain a coherent control of quantum optical systems , enabling true quantum engineering . as a result ,",
    "quantum optical methods made possible to actually perform _ gedanken _ experiments on the foundations of quantum theory .",
    "this control of quantum phenomena allows one to search for novel information processing paradigms , which now promise new technologies based on quantum information science .    soon after einstein s introduction of light quanta , taylor ( 1909 ) tried to find some new effects in a two - slit young - type experiment using extremely faint light , so faint that on average only one photon at a time was inside the apparatus .",
    "no deviation from the classical interference was observed .",
    "now , with fully developed theory of quantized light we know that experiments of this type can not differentiate between the classical explanation ( based on the interference of electric field waves ) and the quantum explanation ( based on the interference of probability amplitudes for photons passing through either of the two slits ) .",
    "the inherently quantum nature of the electromagnetic field , as we know now , is revealed directly only in multiphoton experiments , which , century ago , were impossible .    still , quantum interference of _ truly _ individual photons is certainly a fascinating phenomenon . the first experiment aimed at that was performed by grangier , roger , and aspect ( 1986 ) .",
    "they used photon pairs emitted in atomic cascades , one of the photons was used as a trigger , and the other was fed into a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the usual ( wave - like ) interference pattern was observed .",
    "nevertheless , when the detectors were observing both output ports of the entry beamsplitter of the interferometer , besides background no coincidence was observed , i.e. , a photon was detected only in one of the outputs  a typical particle - like behavior .",
    "modern quantum optics was effectively born in 1956 after the famous hanbury - brown and twiss ( 1956 ) experiment on intensity interferometry .",
    "it was the first serious attempt to study the correlations between intensities recorded at two separated detectors .",
    "it motivated more sophisticated photon - counting and correlation experiments .",
    "the quantum theory of optical coherence of glauber ( 1963 ) gave theoretical clues to search for unambiguously quantum optical phenomena .",
    "carmichael and walls ( 1976 ) predicted photon antibunching in a resonance - fluorescence , which was observed experimentally by kimble , dagenais and mandel ( 1977 , 1978 ) .",
    "the early experiments used atomic beams as sources .",
    "thus , atomic number ( and thus the emission statistics ) fluctuations were unavoidable .",
    "later , diedrich and walther ( 1987 ) realized such experiments using single atoms in traps and observed photon antibunching as well as sub - poissonian statistics in the system .",
    "squeezed states were experimentally generated by using four - wave mixing in atomic sodium ( slusher _ et al_. , 1985 ) and in optical fibers ( shelby _ et al_. , 1986 ) , or by using an optical parametric oscillator ( wu _ et al_. , 1986 ) .",
    "we shall not discuss the above mentioned aspects of quantum optics , as an interested reader can find excellent presentations in , e.g. , walls and milburn ( 1994 ) , mandel and wolf ( 1995 ) , scully and zubairy ( 1997 ) , and lounis and orrit ( 2005 ) .",
    "the study on photon statistics and photon counting techniques enables a direct examination of some of the fundamental distinctions between the quantum and classical concepts of light .",
    "parallel developments in neutron , atomic , and molecular interferometry , as well as modern methods of cooling and trapping ions , etc . , allowed one to probe ever deeper the properties of _ individual _ quantum systems and to realize many of the _ gedanken _ ( thought ) experiments of fundamental interest in quantum physics .",
    "central to these fundamental questions is the phenomenon of quantum entanglement .",
    "einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr , 1935 ) suggested that quantum mechanics might be incomplete .",
    "the trio , epr , tried to argue that the outcome of a measurement on a physical system is determined prior to and independent of the measurement ( realism ) and that the outcome can not depend on any actions in space - like separated regions ( einstein s locality ) .",
    "this epr criterion of local realism  looks quite reasonable to us , particularly as all our classical world and experience fully adhere to it .",
    "moreover , they suggested that perfect quantum correlations , which occur for two particles in a maximally entangled state particles , which is nowadays an icon and a yardstick of entanglement .",
    "] , can be used to define a missing element in quantum theory , namely , elements of reality .",
    "the epr paradox seemed to be interesting [ see especially , ( feynman _ et al _ , 1963 ) ] , but untestable for almost 30 years .",
    "suddenly , bell ( 1964 ) derived his inequalities which revealed that the two - particle correlations for the two spin-@xmath0 singlet disagree with any local realistic model . the pioneering bell experiment , with polarization entangled photons , was due to freedman and clauser ( 1972 ) .",
    "it was refined in the famous experiments by aspect _",
    "et al_. ( 1981 , 1982a , 1982b ) and followed by many others .",
    "the early experiments used polarization entangled photon pairs from atomic cascades ( clauser and shimony , 1978 ) . in late 1980 s this technique was overshadowed by parametric down conversion , and will not be discussed here .    a quarter of century after bell s paper it turned out that the conflict of local realism with quantum mechanics is even more striking for certain three or more particle entangled states .",
    "the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) theorem ( greenberger , horne , and zeilinger , 1989 ; greenberger _",
    "et al_. , 1990 ; mermin , 1990a ) showed that the concept of epr s elements of reality is self - contradictory .",
    "that is , there are situations for which local realism and quantum mechanics make completely opposite predictions , even for definite measurement results .",
    "the ghz papers showed that three or more particle interferometry is a rich untested area , full of exciting paradoxical phenomena .",
    "however , at that time no effective sources of three or four photon entanglements were present .",
    "thus , a new chapter in experimental multi - photon quantum optics had to wait for new ideas and experimental techniques .",
    "the standard source of entangled photon pairs is nowadays the nonlinear optical process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ; see burnham and weinberg , 1970 ) , the inverse of frequency up - conversion . in spdc photons from a pump laser beam , within a nonlinear crystal , can spontaneously be converted into pairs that are momentum and frequency entangled , and in the so - called type - ii process can be also polarization entangled ( kwiat _ et al_. , 1995 ) . today , spdc sources of entangled photon pairs with increasing quality and brightness can be routinely realized .",
    "new techniques , like entanglement due to two - photon emission from quantum dots ( stevenson _ et al_. , 2006 ; young _ et al_. , 2006 ; akopian _ et al_. , 2006 ) , also emerge .    however , since the ghz paper , and even more after the birth of quantum information , three or more photon entanglement was in demand .",
    "it turned out that using the primary two - photon entanglement , by a procedure which is called entanglement swapping ( ukowski _ et al _ , 1993 ) , one can entangle without any direct interaction particles which were independent of each other , or what is more important for us , _ construct _ entanglement of higher order . since photons basically do not interact with each other this method has a special importance in creating multi - photon entanglements .",
    "practical versions of this technique ( ukowski _ et al _ , 1995 ; rarity , 1995 ; zeilinger _ et al _ , 1997 ) are behind all three or more entangled photon interference experiments .",
    "quantum information processing was born once it was realized that the non - classical aspects of quantum mechanics give us a new set of phenomena , thus new practical applications are possible , especially in information transfer and processing . in quantum cryptography",
    "[ wiesner , 1983 ; bennett and brassard , 1984 ; ekert , 1991 ; for a review see ( gisin _ et al_. , 2002 ) ] the complementarity of different measurements on a quantum system is used to establish a secret key shared by two partners , thus enabling for the first time a provably secure communication . in quantum teleportation ( bennett _ et al_. , 1993 )",
    "it is possible to faithfully transfer an unknown qubit state from one system to another by employing entangled states as a quantum channel and transfer of only two bits of classical information .",
    "photons being the fastest information carriers have only very weak coupling to the environment , and are thus best suited for quantum communication tasks .",
    "currently , quantum key distribution was realized for distances 144 km ( ursin _ et al _ , 2007 ; schmitt - manderbach _",
    "et al_. , 2007 ) over a free space , and over more than 100 km in fiber ( rosenberg _ et at_. , 2007 ; peng _ et al_. , 2007 ) . via optical fibers one could distribute photonic entangled states over more than 50 km ( marcikic _ et al_. , 2004 ) .",
    "distribution of entanglement in the atmosphere over vienna reached 7.8 km ( resch _ et al_. , 2005 ) and even 13 km over hefei ( peng _ et al_. , 2005 ) .    for quantum computation , implementations with localized systems like atoms , ions or solid - state devices",
    "seem to be preferable . yet ,",
    "surprisingly , even for quantum computation algorithms , photons offer interesting possibilities , despite the difficulty in storing them . after the discovery that some gates could be realized through teleportation ( gottesman and chuang , 1999 ) , an important breakthrough was the suggestion by knill , laflamme , and milburn ( 2001 ) that even with linear optical elements , in principle , universal quantum computation could be realized .",
    "following these suggestions , various quantum computation primitives have been demonstrated with photons alone ( see section  [ sec : lo - gate ] ) .",
    "a new and probably more practical approach is the concept of a one - way quantum computer  ( raussendorf and briegel , 2001 ; nielsen , 2004 ; for its linear optical implementation , see section  [ sec : lo - oneway ] ) .",
    "the idea is to start with the so - called cluster states also play a significant role in other protocols of quantum information , like quantum error correction ( shor , 1995 ; steane , 1996 ; calderbank and shor , 1996 ; bennett _",
    "et al_. , 1996c ; gottesman , 1997 ) . ]",
    "( briegel and raussendorf , 2001 ) . the computation algorithm",
    "is then performed by applying a sequence of one - qubit measurements .",
    "the cluster states , involving several entangled photons , have recently been realized ( zhang _ et al_. , 2006a ; walther _ et al_. , 2005b ; kiesel _ et al_. , 2005 ; schmid _ et al_. , 2007 ; lu _",
    "et al_. , 2007 ) , and applied to demonstrate elementary quantum gates and algorithms ( walther _ et al_. , 2005b ) .",
    "world - wide laboratories are developing many different physical implementations both of quantum communication devices and of quantum gates .",
    "it will be interesting to see which technologies win .      in this review ,",
    "we want to highlight the exciting progresses , both theoretical and experimental , in multiphoton interferometry , with applications ranging from photonic quantum information processing to fundamental test of quantum mechanics .",
    "an emphasis will be given to the creation of photonic entanglements of various forms , and several important quantum information protocols with photons .",
    "besides manipulation of photons with linear - optical elements , photons can also be manipulated by interaction with matter .",
    "we shall try to make our review almost self - contained , by providing the basic tools for understanding these topics which are to be discussed in detail .",
    "thus , e.g. , we start with the general theory of photons and linear optics , next followed by basic tools and recipes for creating multiphoton entanglement . with these tools",
    "we then discuss fundamental tests of the completeness of quantum mechanics .",
    "this moves us to applications in quantum information .",
    "there exist already many reviews or textbooks that cover topics strongly linked the current review , but not covered here . here",

    "classical interference is a macroscopic expression of the quantum one .",
    "the interference phenomena in the quantum realm are richer and more pronounced .",
    "we discuss here the basic differences between the classical interference understood as interference of waves in space , and quantum one which is interference of various , operationally indistinguishable processes .      in classical physics interference results from the superposition of waves .",
    "it may express itself in the form of intensity variations or intensity correlations .",
    "consider two quasi - monochromatic plane waves linearly polarized in the same direction , described by @xmath1}+c.c.\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the real amplitude of one of the fields , @xmath3 the wave vector , @xmath4 the frequency of both waves , @xmath5 the index numbering the fields , and finally @xmath6 denotes the complex conjugate of the previous expression .",
    "the intensity of the superposed fields at a certain point in space is given by @xmath7},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the difference of the respective parameters for the two fields , e.g. , @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath10 constant in time , or of values varying but always much less than @xmath11 , this formula ( after averaging over time ) describes a young - type interference pattern . in the opposite case , of widely fluctuating @xmath10",
    "no interference can be observed , because the pattern washes out . in the case of @xmath12",
    "one has maximal possible interference .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of the interferometric contrast , or visibility , @xmath13 which in the aforementioned case is @xmath14 .",
    "hanbury - brown - twiss experiment introduced to optics the intensity correlation measurements .",
    "such correlations at two points in space and two moments of time , for two classical fields are described by the intensity correlation function @xmath15 the average is taken over an ensemble , and for stationary fields this is equivalent to the temporal average . even when no intensity variations are observable ( i.e. , for averaged intensity constant in space ) , the intensity correlations can reveal interference effects .",
    "assume that the phases of the two fields fluctuate independently of one another .",
    "then for @xmath16 , the @xmath17 function still exhibits a spatial modulation or maximal visibility of @xmath18 exhibited by the formula : @xmath19\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "this formula can be easily reached by noting that the temporal average of @xmath22\\cos[\\alpha^{\\prime}+\\delta_{12}\\phi(t)],\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , is given by @xmath24 and due to the random nature of @xmath25 only the first two terms survive because both @xmath26 and @xmath27 give @xmath0 , whereas @xmath28    in addition to the phase fluctuations one can take into account also amplitude fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , the basic features of the earlier formula must be retained , as the amplitude fluctuations tend to lower even further the visibility of the intensity correlations patterns .",
    "thus , the visibility of intensity correlations is never full , maximally @xmath18 .",
    "as we shall see there is no bound on visibility in the quantum case . for a broader treatment of these matters",
    "see paul ( 1986 ) .",
    "quantum interference rests on the concept of superposition of probability amplitudes .",
    "the single - particle interference looks almost identical to the classical one .",
    "we replace the fields ( waves ) by amplitudes , @xmath29 , which differ only by the fact that they are suitably normalized .",
    "suppose that the amplitude to detect a photon at @xmath30 , is given by @xmath31 } , \\label{amplitude1}%\\ ] ] if it originates from point @xmath32 , and by @xmath33 } , \\label{amplitude2}%\\ ] ] it originates from @xmath34 .",
    "the quantum mechanical probability density that a particle is detected at @xmath30 is given by @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is an irrelevant constant phase .",
    "thus if the phase difference , @xmath38 , is stable , one can have the young - type interference patterns of up to @xmath39 visibility .",
    "such a stable phase difference can be secured in , e.g. , double - slit experiment .",
    "classical intensity is simply the probability density times the initial intensity @xmath40 of the stream of particles .    as we see",
    "this description differs a lot from the classical _ particle _ picture , in which one would expect that a process originating with state @xmath41 and with possible intermediate stages @xmath42 , leading to an event @xmath43 , would be described by @xmath44 in the quantum case @xmath45 , but one has @xmath46 are the amplitudes to reach the slits , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the difference between ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) is in the assumption [ inherent in ( [ eq4 ] ) ] that the particle had to be in _ one _ of the intermediate situations ( states ) @xmath49 . in the quantum case",
    "any attempt to verify which of the situations actually took place by measurement , with another system , which could be measured later ) . ] puts one back to the classical formula ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the formula ( [ eq5 ] ) leads to interference phenomena , and may be thought as a manifestation of a wave nature of particles , whereas , if we make measurements at @xmath49 , we learn by which way ( _ welcher weg _ ) the particles travel , and the particle nature pops up .",
    "we have a wave - particle duality , which seems to describe all that .",
    "all this becomes much more puzzling once we consider a two - particle experiment .",
    "already , einstein , podolsky and rosen ( 1935 ) pointed out some strange features of such a case .",
    "schrdinger noticed that these features are associated with what he called entangled states , which will be discussed in detail later . at the moment",
    "consider these as superpositions of fully distinguishable products of single - particle states , by which we mean that there is a specific pair of local measurements for which the two subsystems are perfectly correlated ( a result of measurement on one immediately reveals the unique value of the other observable for the second subsystem , which is correlated with the result ) .",
    "consider such a correlation : assume that if particle @xmath14 is at @xmath50 , then particle @xmath51 is also at @xmath50 , and , whenever @xmath14 is at @xmath52 then particle @xmath51 is at @xmath52 .",
    "later on the particles are detected at two different point , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "then , according to the rules given above @xmath55 with @xmath56 where the amplitudes for the second particle are given by formulas ( [ amplitude1 ] ) and ( [ amplitude2 ] ) , with @xmath54 replacing @xmath53 and @xmath57 replacing @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , with @xmath21 .",
    "thus if the phase relation between the two amplitudes is stable one can have absolutely noiseless interference with @xmath39 visibility , while there is no single particle interference : @xmath60",
    "as we shall see , the unbounded visibility is not the only feature by which such interference differs from classical one . for more details",
    "see , e.g. , bialynicki - birula and bialynicka - birula ( 1975 ) .",
    "there is a plethora of other strictly quantum interference phenomena , associated with photons which are in specific quantum states .",
    "these phenomena are of an entirely non - classical character . in the next chapters we shall present many such interference effects (",
    "particularly , see section  [ sec : mp - if ] )",
    ". however , as the non - classicality is linked with entanglement , we have to present first some basic properties of this phenomenon , and later on we shall present experimental techniques to get entanglements in various forms .",
    "the possibility of applying coherent control of quantum optical systems to perform quantum information - processing tasks is based on the fact that quantum information can be encoded in quantum states of certain degrees of freedom ( e.g. , polarizations or spatial modes ) of individual photons , and these individual photons can be manipulated by simple optical elements ( e.g. , various linear - optical elements and interferometers ) , or by letting them interact with matter ( trapped ions , atoms and so on ) at a photon - matter interface . here",
    "we shall show to what extent a photon can represent a qubit , and the simplest elements that are used to manipulate it . to this end , let us first begin with a formal definition of photons and their states , i.e. , the fock states .",
    "the formal theory of quantization of electromagnetic field was formulated by dirac ( 1927 ) .",
    "here we only give its basic mathematical devices for completeness ; for detailed treatment , we refer to standard textbooks on quantum optics , e.g. , walls and milburn ( 1994 ) , mandel and wolf ( 1995 ) , scully and zubairy ( 1997 ) .",
    "a single - photon pure state can be characterized by a specific wave packet profile @xmath61 , i.e. , by the quantum amplitudes for a given momentum @xmath62 and polarization @xmath63 .",
    "according to the born rule @xmath64 gives the probability density of measuring the single photon with the momentum @xmath65 and polarization @xmath66 .",
    "thus , one has @xmath67 one can introduce an arbitrary orthonormal basis @xmath68 , where @xmath69 are natural numbers and @xmath70 .",
    "two different orthonormal bases , to be denoted respectively as primed , and unprimed , are related by a unitary operation : @xmath71 .",
    "the complex numbers @xmath72 satisfy @xmath73 . one can choose a specific basis of the wave packet profiles of the single photon , say @xmath74 , and with each element of such a basis one associates a quantum oscillator - like construction to introduce number states , namely , the fock states .",
    "one introduces the vacuum state @xmath75 , the state with no photons at all .",
    "next for a chosen basis wave packet profiles @xmath74 one associates a pair of operators satisfying the usual relations for creation and annihilation operators , namely , @xmath76=1 $ ] and requires that @xmath77 . using the standard oscillator algebra one constructs the state @xmath78 , which is the state of the electromagnetic field in which one has @xmath79 identical photons of the same wave packet profile @xmath80 , and no other photons elsewhere .",
    "this is denoted by @xmath81 .",
    "finally , one assumes that @xmath82=0 $ ] and @xmath83=\\delta_{nm}$ ] , that is , creation and annihilation operators of photons with orthogonal wave packet profiles always commute .",
    "a general ( normalized ) basis state of the fock space is therefore of the following form : @xmath84 all vectors of the fock space are linear combinations of the above basis states , which have a finite norm .",
    "it is easy to see that if one defines the creation operators with respect to an alternative basis of wave packet profiles ( here the primed ones ) one has : @xmath85 the vacuum state is invariant with respect to such transformation , i.e. , one still has @xmath86 .      a quantum bit , or _ qubit _",
    ", is the most elementary carrier of quantum information .",
    "it is a generalization of the classical bit , which is used to encode classical information .",
    "a classical bit has two distinguishable states 0  and 1 .",
    "the same holds for a qubit .",
    "but since it is a carrier of quantum information with its two distinguishable ( orthogonal ) states @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( which form the so - called computational basis ) , it can also be prepared , in contradistinction to its classical counterpart , in any superposition of these two states : @xmath89 thus , a qubit can do everything that is expected from a bit , but additionally has powers which bits do not have .",
    "any two - level quantum system can represent a qubit .",
    "thus , an archetypal qubit is spin-@xmath90 . but experiments with spin-@xmath90 systems are difficult .",
    "fortunately , photons possess a ready and easily controllable qubit degree of freedom : polarization .",
    "as we shall see , there are also other methods to make photons carry qubits .",
    "_ _ polarization qubits.__the most commonly used photonic qubits are realized using polarization . in this case",
    "arbitrary qubit states can be @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 stand for horizontal and vertical polarizations , respectively .",
    "the advantage of using polarization qubits stems from the fact that they can easily be created and manipulated with high precision ( at @xmath94 level ) by simple linear - optical elements such as polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) , polarizers and waveplates .",
    "_ _ spatial qubits.__a single photon can also appear in two different spatial modes or paths , @xmath95 and @xmath96 : the general state reads @xmath97 .",
    "this may occur , e.g. , if a single photon exits a beamsplitter ( bs ) , with two output modes @xmath95 and @xmath96 . any state of spatial qubits can be prepared by using suitable phase shifters and beamsplitters .",
    "a disadvantage of using spatial qubits is that the coherence between @xmath98 and @xmath99 is sensitive to the relative phase for the paths @xmath95 and @xmath96 between bs , and this is difficult to controll in long - distance cases .    _",
    "_ time - bin qubits.__for a more robust long - distance transmission of quantum information , one can use _ time - bin _ qubits .",
    "the computational basis consists of two states which are of the same spectral shape , but time shifted by much more than the coherence time : @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "any state of time - bin qubits can be realized as following .",
    "suppose that a single - photon pulse is sent through an unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "its wavepacket is split by the first bs , with transmission coefficient @xmath102 and reflection coefficient @xmath103 into two pulses .",
    "the transmitted one propagates along the short arm , and the reflected one along the long arm . if the pulse duration is shorter than the arm length difference , the output from of the output ports of the second , 50:50 , exit bs is two wavepackets well separated in time .",
    "if no photon is registered in say output port i , in the other output one has a single photon in a coherent superposition of two time - bin states @xmath104 .",
    "the phase relation can be controlled with a phase shifter in one of the arms of the interferometer . for more details , see the comprehensive review by gisin _ et al_. ( 2002 ) .    while in this review",
    "we are mainly concerned with the above three implementations of photonic qubits , one should keep in mind that other implementations are possible . in a recent experiment , madsen _",

    "meanwhile , quantum @xmath105-level ( high - dimensional ) systems ( qudit ) can also be realized using , e.g. , orbital angular momentum states of photons ( mair _ et al_. , 2001 ) , or using simultaneously two or more degrees of freedom listed above .",
    "for instance , for the latter case a polarized single photon in a coherent superposition of two spatial modes is a ideal realization of quantum system in a four - dimensional hilbert space ( chen _ et al_. , 2003 ) .",

    "quantum interference may occur also entirely due to indistinguishability of particles .",

    "the fourth - order interference of two photons described above constitutes the basis of the hong - ou - mandel dip in coincidence recording between two single - photon detectors in modes @xmath50 and @xmath52 as function of the flight time difference of the incident photons ; no coincidence can be observed for zero flight time difference for the usual symmetric spatial state of the two photons .",

    "therefore , the hong - ou - mandel effect depends entirely on the distinguishability of photons .",
    "entanglement , according to erwin schrdinger ( 1935)the inventor of this term  contains _ the essence of quantum mechanics_. consider a spin-@xmath146 particle which decays into two spin-@xmath90 particles ( bohm , 1951 ) . the quantum state is such that along any chosen direction , say the @xmath147-axis , the spin of particle 1 can either be up or down , which in turn , by momentum conservation , implies that for particle 2 it is down or up .",
    "the spin state is the rotationally invariant singlet @xmath148 where , e.g. , @xmath149 describes the state of particle 1 with its spin up along the @xmath147-direction .",
    "the minus sign is necessary to get the rotational invariance .",
    "the state describes a coherent superposition of the two product states : there is no information in _ the whole universe _ on which of the two possibilities will be detected at the measurement stage .",
    "none of those two possibilities is the actual case .",
    "actualization can happen only via a measurement .",
    "this superposition , like any other , e.g. in the famous double slit experiment , survives as long as no measurement actualizing one of those possibilities is performed , and the particles do not interact with any environment .",
    "none of the possibilities actually takes place , but both of them affect the predictions for all measurements .",
    "another property of the state ( [ singlet1 ] ) is that it does not make _ any _ prediction about an individual spin measurement on one of the two particles , the results are random .",
    "the spin state of one of the particles is described by a reduced density operator , which is a totally random state @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the unit operator .",
    "all information contained in the state in eq .",
    "( [ singlet1 ] ) defines only joint properties ( schrdinger , 1935 ) : _ the two spins , if measured with respect to the same direction , will be found opposite_. as a matter of fact this property fully defines the singlet state .",
    "imagine that the two particles are far apart , one in the laboratory of alice and the other one in bob s .",
    "as soon as alice measures the value of a spin projection along some axis , new information is gained , and for her the state of bob s particle is well defined .",
    "this is independent of the spatial separation between them .",
    "thus a state like ( [ singlet1 ] ) is a perfect device to study , and reveal , the epr paradox , ) : if , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty ( i.e. , with probability equal to unity ) the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity .",
    "this would imply that to any possible spin measurement on any one of our particles we can assign such an element of physical reality on the basis of a corresponding measurement on the other particle .",
    "whether or not we can assign an element of reality to a specific spin component of one of the systems must be independent of which measurement we actually perform on the other system and even independent of whether we care to perform any measurement at all on that system . in this way epr argumented for incompleteness of quantum mechanics , as it is a theory without their elements of reality ] and its consequences . basically , all earlier studies of entanglement concentrated on that aspect of such states [ for a review see ( clauser and shimony , 1978 ) ] .",
    "later , we saw an emergence of research on entanglement of three or more particles , practically with the advent of quantum information .",
    "the most important tool for the analysis of pure states of two subsystems is the so - called schmidt decomposition . for any pure state ,",
    "@xmath152 , of a _ pair _ of subsystems , one described by a hilbert space of dimension @xmath124 , the other by a space of dimension @xmath153 , say @xmath154 , one can find preferred bases , one for the first system , the other one for the second , such that the state is a sum of bi - orthogonal terms , i.e. , @xmath155 with @xmath156 , for @xmath157 and @xmath158 . the coefficients @xmath159 are real .",
    "the appropriate single subsystem bases , here @xmath160 and @xmath161 , depend upon the state .",
    "a proof of schmidt decomposition can be found in the book by peres ( 2002 ) .",
    "a generalization of schmidt decomposition to more than two subsystems is not straightforward [ see ( carteret , higuchi , and sudbery , 2000 ) ] .",
    "it is easy to show that the two reduced density matrices of ( [ schmidt ] ) are endowed with the same spectrum .",
    "this does not hold for three or more particle subsystems .",
    "thus , every pure state of two spins can be put into the following form : @xmath162 where the states @xmath163 , @xmath158 , are the eigenstates of the @xmath164 operator .",
    "the unit vectors @xmath165 are individually defined for each of the particles .",
    "they define the basis for the schmidt decomposition for each of the subsystems .",
    "more complicated is the theory of entanglement of mixed states . a state ( pure or mixed ) described by a density matrix @xmath166 of a composite quantum system consisting of two generic sub - systems a and b is separable if and only if @xmath166 is a convex combination of local density matrices , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , of the two sub - systems , namely , @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171",
    "otherwise , @xmath166 is entangled ( werner , 1989 ) . for composite systems of more than two sub - systems this definition can be generalized in a straightforward way .",
    "basic structural criteria , which decide whether the given density operator represents an entangled state , were first given by peres ( 1996 ) and horodecki _",
    "et al_. ( 1996 ) .",
    "the full set of separable mixed states is a convex set in a multidimensional real space of hermitian operators .",
    "thus , any entangled state is separated from the set of separable states by a hyperplane .",
    "the equation of such a hyperplane is defined by an element of the space , namely , a hermitian operator @xmath172 , which is called entanglement witness  ( horodecki _ et al_. , 1996 ; terhal , 2000 ; lewenstein _ et al_. , 2000 ; bru  _ et al_. , 2002 ) . since the scalar product in the operator space is given by @xmath173 , the equation of the hyperplane is given by @xmath174 . for all separable states",

    "the predictions for the spin-@xmath90 singlet are an example , in which @xmath236 can acquire the maximal value @xmath237 allowed by quantum mechanics , known as the cirelson bound ( cirelson , 1980 ; landau , 1987 ) .",
    "in fact , predictions for any pure , non - factorizable ( i.e. , not necessarily maximally entangled ) two - system state lead to violations ( gisin and peres , 1992 ) .",

    "the new feature is that instead of purely statistical reasoning for deriving bell s inequality , one can follow the spirit of the epr paper , attempt to define elements of reality  basing on specific perfect correlations of the entangled state , and with the same perfect correlations show contradiction of these elements with exactly those quantum predictions which were used to define them ( greenberger , horne , and zeilinger , 1989 ) .",

    "introduction of epr elements of reality leads to a prediction concerning one of the perfect correlations , ( [ ghz-8 ] ) , which is _ opposite _ with respect to the quantum prediction .",
    "we have a bell theorem without inequalities  ( greenberger _ et al_. , 1990 ) .",
    "_ _ multiparticle bell inequalities.__in laboratory one can not expect perfect correlations .",
    "thus , any test of local realism based on the ghz correlations has to resort to some bell - type inequalities .",
    "series of such inequalities were discovered by mermin ( 1990b ) , ardehali ( 1991 ) and belinskii and klyshko ( 1993 ) . to get the full set of such inequalities , for correlation functions involving the product of the result of all parties , it is enough to generalize the relation ( [ belleq-0 ] ) to the situation in question .",
    "e.g. , for three partners one has @xmath265 with the new symbols being an obvious extension of the ones in ( [ belleq-0 ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following bell inequality [ werner and wolf ( 2001 ) ; weinfurter and ukowski ( 2001 ) ] : @xmath266 which is the _ necessary and sufficient _ condition for correlation functions involved in it , @xmath267 , to have a local realistic model [ for proofs see werner and wolf ( 2001 ) , ukowski and brukner ( 2002 ) ] .",

    "@xmath269 is growing exponentially with @xmath124 .",
    "this is an important fact , because one expects noise to increase the more photons are involved in an interferometric experiment ( due to the increasing complications , and alignment problems ) .",
    "thus non - classicality of the ghz correlations can be significant even for many particles ( mermin , 1990b ; klyshko , 1993 ;",
    "roy and singh , 1991 ; ukowski 1993 ; gisin and bechmann - pasquinucci , 1998 ) .    two - observer variations of the ghz theorem were discovered recently ( cabello , 2001a , 2001b ; chen _ et al_. , 2003 ) .",
    "so far , the ghz-(type ) theorem has been tested with three - photon entanglement ( pan _ et al_. , 2000 ) , four - photon entanglement ( zhao _ et al_. , 2003a ) and two - photon hyper - entanglement ( yang _ et al_. , 2005 , and somewhat indirectly by cinelli _ et al_. , 2005 ) .",
    "all experiments confirm the quantum predictions .",
    "there are many other fundamental tests of quantum mechanics .",
    "for instance , for two - particle states , hardy ( 1993 ) has found situations , where quantum mechanics predicts a specific result to occur _ sometimes _ , and local realism predicts the same result never to occur ( for an experiment see boschi _ et al_. , 1997 ) . in a remarkable paper by ekert ( 1991 ) ,",
    "bell s inequalities and entanglement have a direct application in quantum cryptography .",
    "actually , there is a fascinating link ( scarani and gisin , 2001 ; gisin _ et al_. , 2002 ) between security of certain quantum communication protocols and bell s theorem .",
    "this link extends also to ( quantum ) communication complexity protocols ( brukner _ et al_. , 2004 ) .",
    "a recently discovered two - observer variation of the ghz theorem also plays a key role in a deterministic and efficient quantum cryptography protocol ( chen _ et al_. , 2006d ) .",
    "the logical conclusion one can draw from the violation of local realism is that at least one of its assumptions fails .",
    "specifically , either locality or realism or both can not provide a foundational basis for quantum theory .",
    "each of the resulting possible positions has strong supporters and opponents in the scientific community .",
    "however , bell s theorem is unbiased with respect to these views : on the basis of this theorem , one can not , even in principle , favour one over the other .",
    "it is therefore important to ask whether incompatibility theorems similar to bell s can be found in which at least one of these concepts is relaxed .",
    "a recent work ( groblacher _ et al_. , 2007 ) addresses a broad class of nonlocal hidden - variable theories that are based on a very plausible type of realism and that provide an explanation for all existing bell - type experiments .",
    "nevertheless , their conflict with quantum predictions were demonstrated , both in theory and experiment , following the recent approach of leggett ( 2003 ) , who introduced the class of nonlocal models and formulated an incompatibility theorem .",
    "it is sufficient for our purposes to focus our description on the polarization degree of freedom of photons .",
    "the theories are based on the following assumptions : ( 1 ) all measurement outcomes are determined by pre - existing properties of particles independent of the measurement ( realism ) ; ( 2 ) physical states are statistical mixtures of subensembles with definite polarization , where ( 3 ) polarization is defined such that expectation values taken for each subensemble obey malus law ( the cosine dependence of the intensity of a polarized beam behind an ideal polarizer ) .    these assumptions provide a natural explanation of quantum mechanically separable states ( polarization states indeed obey malus law ) .",
    "in addition , they do not explicitly demand locality ; namely , measurement outcomes may very well depend on parameters in space - like separated regions . as a consequence",
    ", such theories can explain some important features of quantum mechanically entangled ( non - separable ) states of two particles :  first , they do not allow information to be transmitted faster than the speed of light ; second , they reproduce perfect correlations for all measurements in the same bases , which is a fundamental feature of the bell singlet state ; and third , they provide a model for all earlier performed experiments in which the chsh inequality was violated .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that all models based on assumptions ( 1)-(3 ) are at variance with other quantum predictions .",
    "a general framework of such models is the following : assumption ( 1 ) requires that an individual binary measurement outcome @xmath41 for a polarization measurement along direction @xmath270 ( that is , whether a single photon is transmitted or absorbed by a polarizer set at a specific angle ) is predetermined by some set of hidden - variables @xmath66 , and a three - dimensional vector @xmath271 , as well as by some set of other possibly non - local parameters @xmath272 ( for example , measurement settings in space - like separated regions )  that is , @xmath273 . according to assumption ( 3 ) ,",
    "particles with the same @xmath271 but with different @xmath66 build up subensembles of definite polarization  described by a probability distribution @xmath274 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath275 , obtained by averaging over @xmath66 , fulfils malus law , that is , @xmath276 .",
    "finally , with assumption ( 2 ) , the measured expectation value for a general physical state is given by averaging over the distribution @xmath277 of subensembles , that is , @xmath278 .",
    "the correlation function of measurement results for a source emitting well - polarized photons is defined as the average of the products of the individual measurement outcomes : @xmath279 for a general source producing mixtures of polarized photons the observable correlations are averaged over a distribution of the polarizations @xmath280 , and the general correlation function @xmath281 is given by : @xmath282 it is a very important trait of this model that there exist subensembles of definite polarizations ( independent of measurements ) and that the predictions for the subensembles agree with malus law .",
    "it is clear that other classes of non - local theories , possibly even fully compliant with all quantum mechanical predictions , might exist that do not have this property when reproducing entangled states .",
    "such theories may , for example , include additional communication ( bacon and toner , 2003 ) or dimensions ( neeman , 1986 ) . a specific case deserving comment is bohm s theory ( bohm , 1951 ) .",
    "there the non - local correlations are a consequence of the non - local quantum potential , which exerts suitable torque on the particles leading to experimental results compliant with quantum mechanics . in that theory , neither of the two particles in a maximally entangled state carries any angular momentum at all when emerging from the source ( dewdney _ et al_. , 1987 ) .",
    "the theories described here are incompatible with quantum theory .",
    "the basic idea of the incompatibility theorem ( leggett , 2003 ) uses the following identity , which holds for any numbers @xmath283 and @xmath284 : @xmath285 then the following generalized leggett - type inequality can be obtained ( groblacher _ et al_. , 2007 ) : @xmath286 where @xmath287 is a uniform average of all correlation functions , defined in the plane of @xmath288 and @xmath289 , with the same relative angle @xmath290 ; the subscript nlhv stands for nonlocal hidden - variables . for the inequality to be applicable , the vectors @xmath291 and @xmath32 necessarily have to lie in a plane orthogonal to the one defined by @xmath292 and @xmath34 .",
    "this contrasts with the standard experimental configuration used to test the chsh inequality , which is maximally violated for settings in one plane .",
    "quantum theory violates inequality ( [ nlhv ] ) .",
    "consider the quantum predictions for the polarization singlet state of two photons , @xmath293   $ ] , where , for example , @xmath294 denotes a horizontally polarized photon propagating to alice .",
    "the quantum correlation function for the measurements @xmath288 and @xmath295 performed on photons depends only on the relative angles between these vectors , and therefore @xmath296 .",
    "thus the left hand side of inequality ( [ nlhv ] ) , for quantum predictions , reads @xmath297 .",
    "the maximal violation of inequality ( [ nlhv ] ) is for @xmath298 . for this difference angle ,",
    "the bound given by inequality ( [ nlhv ] ) equals 3.792 and the quantum value is 3.893 . thus the case for realistic theories receives yet another hit .",
    "another class of theorems , which show the drastic difference between the classical and the quantum , are the no - go theorems for non - contextual hidden variables ( nchv ) interpretations of quantum mechanics [ bell , 1966 ; kochen and specker , 1967 ; mermin , 1990c ; for a survey , see ( mermin , 1993 ) ] .",
    "such realistic theories assume that hidden variables fix the values of measurement results of all possible observables for the given system , and that such values are not dependent on the measurement context .",
    "that is , they do not depend on which other observables are commeasurable with them .",
    "the measurement context is defined by a maximal observable .",
    "it is interesting that already in the lowest dimensional case , for which a degenerate observable can exist , and only such observables can be measurable in different contexts , that is for dimension @xmath299 , non - contextual hidden variable models of quantum mechanics are impossible ( kochen and specker , 1967 ) .",
    "a degenerate observable is just a constant . ]",
    "bell s theorem is a case of no - go theorem for nchv for which non - contextuality is given by the locality assumption . as locality forbids the result on alice s side to depend on the actual observable chosen to be measured by bob , etc .",
    ", the non - contextuality is enforced by the relativistic causality .",
    "this is very appealing , because relativity is assumed to be a principle setting theory for causal links .",
    "non - contextuality , without the help from relativistic principles , seems to be a much stronger assumption .",
    "nevertheless , both nchv theories and local realistic ones can be reduced to the assumption of the existence of a joint probability distribution for noncommeasurable observables .",
    "ever since the seminal work of epr there has been a quest for generating entanglement between quantum particles . entangled",
    "photon sources play a central role in the experimental study of quantum mechanical foundations and are vital resource in optical quantum information processing . the early bell - test experiments used entangled photons from atomic cascades .",
    "such a source has a drawback .",
    "the directions of emissions are uncorrelated .",
    "thus , the collection efficiency of the entangled photons is low .",
    "fortunately , it was discovered in mid eighties that the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion [ first observation by burnham and weinberg ( 1970 ) ] allows pairs of entangled photons to be collected with reasonable intensity and with very high purity .",

    "an incoming higher - energy pump photon sometimes splits into two lower - energy daughter photons such that energy and momentum inside the crystal are almost precisely conserved .",
    "thus , the photon pair is strongly correlated in energy and momentum , or , complementarily , in space and time .",

    "we will give a brief introduction to the physics of spdc and the entangled photons in various distinct degrees of freedom [ such as polarization , momentum , or time ( time bin ) ] .",
    "for a comprehensive survey of spdc , we also refer to , e.g. , ( shih , 2003 ) .",
    "if one shines strong laser light on a crystal , the pump photons have some probability to split into correlated pairs of lower energy .",
    "this is called spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) . the new photons",
    ", customarily called signal  and idler , satisfy the conservation - like ( so called _ phase matching _ ) relations : within the crystal one has @xmath300 where subscripts @xmath146 , @xmath301 and @xmath114 denote , respectively , pump , signal and idler wave vectors , and the respective frequencies satisfy @xmath302 these relations have a form of conservation laws , but they result out of an interference process within the crystal .",
    "the emerging pairs of photons are tightly correlated in time and emission directions .    _ _ crystal - field interaction.__in the interaction hamiltonian of the electromagnetic field with an atom or a molecule , the dominating part is @xmath303 , i.e. , scalar product of the dipole moment , @xmath304 , of the atoms or molecules with the local electric field .",
    "since the electric polarization , @xmath305 , of a medium is given by the mean dipole moment of the atoms or molecules per unit volume , the principal term of the field - crystal interaction hamiltonian , @xmath306 , is proportional to @xmath307 where @xmath93 is the volume of the crystal .",

    "quantum interference of independent photons is also practically vital for modern quantum information processing ranging from quantum communication ( in particular , quantum repeater ) to linear - optical quantum computing ( see section  [ computing ] ) .",
    "these quantum information schemes tacitly assume stable interference between two independently emitted photons .",
    "to fulfil this , it is important to assure that there exists no possibility whatsoever for the coherence properties of the light emitted by either source to be influenced by the other .",

    "such a configuration addresses exactly the needs for practical quantum communication and computation schemes . in the case of long - distance quantum communication any common optical elements shared by the sources and thus any dependence would impede the working of the scheme over large distances due to dispersion or losses .",

    "further related experiments provided gradual progress with respect to the independence of the utilized sources .",
    "a first step was the interference of two triggered single photons created via spdc by the same pump pulse passing twice through the very same spdc crystal in the innsbruck teleportation experiment ( bouwmeester _ et al_. , 1997 ) .",
    "further contributions used photons generated by two mutually coherent time - separated pulses from the same mode - locked laser in one spdc crystal ( keller _ et al_. , 1998 ) and , later , generated in one quantum dot ( santori _ et al_. , 2002 ) .    in realistic realization of quantum repeaters ( briegel _",

    "however , such a naive solution is not a scalable scheme .",
    "this is because the maximal output power of a single laser is technically limited and the efficiency of the scheme will thus exponentially decrease with the number of segments .",
    "a practical solution is to utilize synchronized pump lasers to prepare entangled pairs in each segment and then to connect these pairs via entanglement swapping .",
    "yang _ et al_. ( 2006 ) achieved such an entanglement swapping with independent entangled photon pairs that are created by two synchronized fs lasers .",

    "the short pulse duration and little timing jitter are sufficient to ensure the perfect interference of two independent photons produced by synchronized laser pulses .",

    "for triggered single photons generated via spdc , the initial sharp time correlation of spdc photon pairs poses a problem without frequency filtering : the times of registration of the trigger photons provide temporal distinguishability of the photon registrations behind the bs .",
    "short pump pulses and spectral filters narrower than the bandwidth of these pulses in the paths of the photons give the desired indistinguishability ( ukowski _ et al_. , 1995 ) .",
    "additional timing information is contained in the time difference between the independent pulses pumping the two spdc crystals . in principle",
    ", one could compensate this again by filtering . for pulses without any time correlation this would , however , require extremely narrow filters and eventually result in prohibitively low count rates . synchronizing the pulses of the two independent pumps increases the probability of joint emission events and hence the count rates .",
    "the fact that one needs to actively synchronize the sources is a direct unavoidable consequence of their independence .",

    "however , the main focus of this section will be quantum computing ( the usual circuit model based on quantum logic gates , or measurement - based model based on cluster states ) with photons , a surprising possibility discovered by knill , laflamme , and milburn ( 2001 ) .",
    "this breakthrough , together with many subsequent theoretical and experimental advance , opens up an exciting future of manipulating multi - photon states with profound applications .    before presenting these specific advances , let us give a set of _ criteria for quantum computing with photons _ while keeping in mind the divincenzo criteria ( divincenzo , 2000 ) :    1 .   _ encoding qubits with the degree of freedom that is easy to implement high - precision single - qubit operations and robust against various noises .",

    "4 .   _ quantum memory being able to store single photons for a reasonably long time and to read them out on demand_. this requirement simply stems from the fact that photons fly at the speed of light !",

    "surprisingly , knill , laflamme and milburn ( 2001 ) , using the dual - rail encoding [ for polarization encoding , see ( spedalieri _ et al_. , 2006 ) ] , has shown that nondeterministic two - qubit logic operations can be performed using linear optical elements , additional photons ( ancilla ) and postselection based on the output of single - photon detectors .",
    "they further demonstrated that the success rate of the logic gates can be arbitrarily close to one by using more additional ancilla and detectors .",

    "the original knill - laflamme - milburn scheme is , however , not economical in resources .",
    "various groups have been working on reducing the complexity of the scheme while improving its theoretical efficiency ( koashi _ et al_. , 2001 ; pittman _ et al_. , 2001 ; ralph _ et al_. , 2002a , 2002b ) . to be a supplement to the nice review on linear - optical quantum computing by kok _ et al_. ( 2007 ) , we have to leave the detailed survey of many beautiful relevant developments , both on the theoretical and the experimental sides . for more details",

    "a crucial requirement is the _ classical feed - forwardability _ ( scheel _",

    "this information can then be feed - forward in such a way as to condition future operations on the photon modes . for those destructive cnot operations ,",
    "they necessarily destroy the output states such that schemes based on them are not classically feed - forwardable .",
    "fortunately , it has been suggested ( pittman _ et al_. , 2001 ) that a destructive cnot gate together with the quantum parity check can be combined with a pair of entangled photons to implement a nondestructive ( conventional ) cnot gate that satisfies the feed - forwardability criterion .",
    "moreover , when combined with single - qubit hadamard rotations to perform a controlled - sign gate [ so as to build the cluster states via nielsen s method ( nielsen , 2004 ) ] this gate also satisfies the criterion that when it fails the qubits can be projected out in the computational basis . in this section",

    "one immediate application of the proposed cnot gate is that it can be used to generate , though probabilistically , entanglement between the control qubit and target qubit ( see section  [ sec : circuit ] ) .",

    "the crucial bell - state measurement can be accomplished probabilistically by applying a nondestructive cnot operation and performing a subsequent polarization analysis on photons 2 and 5 .    as explained above , to demonstrate the proposed non - destructive cnot gate one has to prepare one ancilla entangled pair and two independent single photons .",
    "the experimental setup on entanglement purification ( pan _ et al_. , 2003b ; section  [ sec : lo - pure ] ) could be , in principle , modified to implement this probabilistic cnot gate , the creation of two entangled photon pairs into the same pair of modes would , however , contribute spurious four - fold events of the same order of magnitude , hence leading to a very low visibility .",

    "however , such triggered single photons have large bandwidth ( i.e. , small coherent time ) and can not be created at controllable time due to the randomness of spdc . in the past few years",
    ", there are significant advance on the single - photon emitter and its controllability , using solid - state devices , atoms and ions .",
    "these demonstrated single - photon emitting mechanisms include quantum dots ( michler _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000b ; santori _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 , 2002 ; pelton _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) , nitrogen - vacancy color centers ( brouri _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; kurtsiefer _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) , neutral atoms ( kuhn _ et al . _ , 2002 ; mckeever _ et al . _ , 2004 ; darqui _ et al . _ , 2005 ) , ions ( keller _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) , and molecules ( brunel _ et al_. , 1999 ; lounis and moerner , 2000 ) .",
    "solid - state devices may allow high single - photon rates .",
    "but due to inhomogeneities in both the environment of the emitters and the emitters themselves , it is a major problem for preparing a few truly identical sources .",
    "a fully controllable single - photon source is achievable if one could trap single - atoms in high - finesse optical cavities for a sufficiently long time .",
    "such a source is spectrally narrow , and the photons are emitted into a well - defined spatial mode .",
    "however , the operation of high - finesse cavities is a experimentally challenging work , and the single - photon rate is limited by the cavity .",
    "so far , the measured efficiency to detect a single photon per trial is typically less than 1% . in this respect ,",
    "a fully controllable single - photon source based on atomic ensembles ( see section [ sec : dlcz ] ) is more promising .",
    "so far , the largest optical one - way quantum computer , namely , six photons entangled in cluster states , was reported by lu _ et al_. ( 2007 ) .",
    "the experiment by walther _ et al_. ( 2005b ) demonstrated the basic idea of the one - way optical quantum computing . in this experiment ,",
    "four - photon polarization - entangled cluster state close to @xmath925 was created via spdc .",
    "@xmath926 is is equivalent to the four - qubit linear cluster @xmath927 , and @xmath928 and @xmath929 ( fig .",
    "[ ow - exp ] ) under the local unitary operation @xmath930 on the physical qubits , where @xmath931 ( @xmath627 ) is a hadamard ( identity ) operation .",
    "@xmath926 can easily be reduced to @xmath932 by measuring qubit 1 in the computational basis .",
    "it can also be converted to @xmath933 by the local unitary operation @xmath934 and a swap ( or relabelling ) of qubits 2 and 3 .",
    "[ ptb ]    ow-exp.eps    to completely characterize the state so generated , quantum - state tomography was performed to extract the density matrix from a discrete set of experimental measurements , which in this case consist of @xmath935 linearly independent four - photon polarization projections . the measured fidelity @xmath936 .",
    "as we just mentioned , @xmath926 can be reduced to @xmath932 by measuring qubit 1 in the computational basis . whereas the loss of one qubit in a ghz state is already sufficient to completely disentangle the state , @xmath937 $ ] particles have to be removed from an @xmath124-particle cluster state in order to leave a separable state .",
    "the cluster states share this persistency of entanglement ( briegel and raussendorf , 2001 ) .",
    "both of the two remarkable entanglement properties of the four - qubit cluster state were confirmed from the full tomographic measurements .    using the cluster state @xmath926 ,",
    "the essentials of cluster - state quantum computation were demonstrated by realizing a universal set of quantum logic operations : single - qubit rotations and non - trivial two - qubit gates .",
    "the latter can be realized with two - dimensional cluster states@xmath938 , @xmath929 , and @xmath933 .",
    "the quality of each quantum computation was experimentally characterized by comparing the measured output state to the ideal using the state fidelity .",
    "interesting avenues for study include full quantum gate characterization using quantum process tomography ( chuang and nielsen , 1997 ; poyatos _ et al_. , 1997 ) .",
    "interestingly , walther _",
    "et al_. also demonstrated a two - qubit implementation of grover s fast quantum search ( grover , 1997 ) using the cluster state model .",
    "the goal of a search is to identify one out of @xmath124 elements of a database .",
    "formally , one could consider the database as a black box that labels one of @xmath124 possible inputs leaving all others unchanged .",
    "the challenge , then , is to find that labelled state .",
    "the best classical strategy chooses the inputs randomly one by one and checks for the label ; it takes , on average , about @xmath939 calculations to find the special input .",
    "quantum parallelism in grover s algorithm allows for all inputs to be processed simultaneously in superposition , while interference enhances the probability of finding the desired outcome in only @xmath940 calculations of the function . in the case of a two - bit function ( @xmath481 ) , the difference is even more dramatic , as grover s algorithm needs only one calculation of the function , whereas classically three evaluations are needed in the worst case , and 2.25 evaluations are needed on average . in this experiment ,",
    "the quantum circuit implemented by the box cluster @xmath933 can be seen as precisely that one required for grover s algorithm provided that the final readout measurements are made in the @xmath609 basis .",
    "the measured probability of the quantum computer determining the correct outcome is about 90% , whereas the theoretical probability is unit in the ideal case .    as a proof of principle ,",
    "the described experiment used no feedforward or subsequent corrections given a successful measurement .",
    "this reduces the success rate of the computation by a factor of two for every measurement as compared to ideal , deterministic gate operations .",
    "an important challenge is to implement fast feedforward where earlier measurement outcomes actually change the setting of a future measurement in real time .",
    "recently prevedel _ et al_. ( 2007 ) reported a concatenated scheme of measurement and active , fast feed - forward in a one - way quantum computing experiment .",
    "harnessing the hilbert - space structure of quantum physics to encode and process information may well a crucial component for the future quantum engineering that could dramatically affect even our everyday life .",
    "the development of quantum information science has based on quantum mechanics and calls for an in - deepth understanding of the very relation between physics and information in general .",
    "quite probably , it would also refresh our today s view on quantum mechanics itself .",
    "experiments with photons have had a pioneering role in this context .",
    "the topics we reviewed are featured by emerging technology and rapid development .",
    "this makes it impossible to cover in detail all the ongoing developments and many have to be left out with regret .",
    "the photon idea has achieved fertile applications so far . as for the future",
    ", we would like to remark that , according to several recent proposals reviewed above , photons can be a strong candidate not only for long - distance quantum communication , but also for large - scale quantum computing . given several atomic - ensemble - based technologies",
    ", linear - optical quantum information processing has a brilliant future . as we have emphasized throughout this review",
    ", linear - optical elements can manipulate photons with very high accuracy .",
    "the interface of photons and atomic ensembles offers the fascinating playground for integrating the linear - optical and atomic - ensemble - based techniques for long - distance quantum communication ( sections  [ sec : dlcz ] ) and scalable optical quantum computing ( section  [ sec : lo - oneway ] ) .",
