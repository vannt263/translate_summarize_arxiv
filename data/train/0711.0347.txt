    "in 2004 @xcite  @xcite developed the elegant method of particle separation by deterministic lateral displacement in so - called microfluidic bumper arrays .",
    "the method , which relies on the laminar flow properties characteristic of microfluidcs , shows a great potential for fast and accurate separation of particles on the micrometer scale  @xcite . among the key assets of the deterministic lateral displacement separation principle",
    "are that clogging can be avoided because particles much smaller than the feature size of the devices can be separated , that the devices are passive , i.e.  the particles bump into solid obstacles or bumpers , and that the separation process is continuous .",
    "more precisely , particle transport in microfluidic bumper arrays is primarily governed by convection due to the fluid flow and displacement due to interaction with the bumpers in the array  @xcite .",
    "these processes are deterministic and the critical diameter for separation of relatively large particles in these devices is well understood in terms of the width of flow lanes bifurcating around the bumpers in the periodic arrays  @xcite . however ,",
    "if bumper arrays and particles are scaled down , diffusion will influence the separation process and affect the critical particle size significantly .",
    "previously reported data on separation of particles in bumper arrays all show a bias towards larger critical particle size than that given by the width of the flow lanes nearest to the bumpers of the array  @xcite . in this work",
    "we extend existing models by adding diffusion and taking particle - diameter dispersion into account , and thereby explain the observed discrepancy .",

    "the width @xmath2 of flow - lane @xmath3 depends on the position in the gap . ]    in bumper arrays particles are convected by the fluid flow through an array of bumpers placed in columns separated by the distance @xmath4 in the flow direction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bumper - view](a ) . for a given integer @xmath5 ,",
    "the array is made @xmath5-periodic in the flow direction by displacing the bumpers in a given column a distance @xmath6 perpendicular to the flow direction with respect to the bumper positions in the previous column . due to this periodicity of the array and the laminarity of the flow ,",
    "the stream can naturally be divided into @xmath5 lanes , each carrying the same amount of fluid flux , and each having a specific path through the device , see ref .",

    "is given as @xmath17 .",
    "a small particle with @xmath18 will never leave its initial flow lane and will thus be convected in the general flow direction following a so - called zigzag path .",
    "large particles with @xmath19 will quickly bump against a bumper and from then on be forced by consecutive bumping to follow the skew direction of the array geometry , the so - called displacement path .",
    "when a particle gets bumped by a bumper in the array it will be displaced perpendicular to the flow direction until its center is located one particle radius  @xmath20 from the surface of the bumper .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath21 lanes of displacement , @xmath22    in the bulk fluid , where the lanes are assumed to have equal width @xmath6 , see fig .",

    "during the average time @xmath25 it takes a particle to move by convection from one column to the next , it also diffuses .",
    "we assume that the diffusion process perpendicular to the flow direction is normally distributed with mean value zero and variance @xmath26 where the diffusivity  @xmath27 is given by the stokes ",

    "the black lines show the theoretically predicted critical particle size for the bumper arrays used by @xcite  @xcite , @xcite  @xcite and @xcite  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the experimental data points are representing particles following bumper paths ( open symbols ) , zigzag paths ( solid black symbols ) , and neither of these paths ( solid gray symbols ) . ]    in order to escape bumping , a particle must in the time interval @xmath33 diffuse more than the difference @xmath34 between the bulk displacement and the shift in position of the next bumper .",
    "the probability @xmath35 for this to happen is given in terms of the error function as @xmath36 where we have introduced the @xmath37-dependence explicitly .",
    "when a particle is transported through a bumper array it must bump at every bumper within one period of the array in order to be displaced one gap at the outlet .",

    "we define the critical particle size @xmath38 to be the size for which half of the particles escape bumping as they pass one period of the array .",

    "our model suggests that the deviation of the critical particle size from the width of the first flow lane can be explained by diffusion of the particles . in fig .",
    "[ fig : inglisdata ] above , it is seen how well the lines are predicting the transition between zigzag paths and displacement paths : the thick line is dividing open and closed triangles , the dashed line is dividing open and closed squares , and , to a lesser extent , the dotted line is dividing open and closed circles .",

    "the model allows us to study the relative influence of all three phenomena on the separation efficiency in a fast and simple manner .",
    "in particular our results suggest that the critical size for separation or displacement , studied above , must be supplemented by a smaller critical size below which pure diffusion governs the motion of the particles in the bumper array .",
    "this prediction has not yet been tested experimentally .      at any instant ,",
    "a particle is assumed to be positioned in the center of a flow lane @xmath3 situated in a gap @xmath1 in some column @xmath0 of the array . for simplicity",

    "if it ends up in the last lane ( @xmath45 ) in one gap , it will be shifted to the first lane ( @xmath46 ) in the subsequent gap .",

    "[ fig : weights ] , closed squares ) . the relative number of particles following the zigzag path @xmath52 can be found by integrating over all particle sizes smaller than the critical diameter given by the array geometry    @xmath64    similarly , the relative number of particles following the displacement path @xmath53 can be found by integrating over all particle sizes larger than @xmath16 @xmath65    the system is still a bi - modal system because @xmath61 for all particle sizes .      in 1d during the time step @xmath33 a particle diffuses the distance @xmath66 , the average of which is the size - dependent diffusion length @xmath67 given by @xmath68 in our model we discretize the transverse diffusion as the properly rounded number of flow lanes crossed by the particle during diffusion , @xmath69 the addition of diffusion smears out the displacement of the particles and causes the critical radius to be larger than in the diffusion - less case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : weights ] , open symbols ) .      very small particles are completely dominated by diffusion , and the particle distribution at the end of the array is simply given by the transverse diffusion of the particles during the time @xmath70 it takes for the particle to be convected all the way @xmath71 through the array . for small particles",
    "we therefore have @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "as the particle diameter @xmath37 is increased , the bumpers begin to become important as the diffusion length @xmath67 , eq .",

    "( [ eq : ldisp ] ) . using the criterion @xmath74 , with the parameter values used in fig .",

    "this cross - over value is indicated by the left - most vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : weights ] , and it fits well with the simulation data .      large particles will interact with the bumpers at every row in the array and their position is thus reset at every bump to be @xmath23 .",
    "diffusion can therefore be neglected for such particles , they all follow the displacement path , and @xmath58 .",
    "as the particle diameter is lowered , the probability @xmath76 that a particle escapes the displacement path can be estimated by the probability of diffusing from the displaced position to the last flow lane in the gap , i.e.  the distance @xmath77 .",
    "this probability @xmath35 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_esc ] ) .    in order to follow the displacement path ,",
    "a particle must bump at each row in the array .",

    "if a particle evades bumping at a bumper , it will be convected by the flow through a full period of the array before bumping is possible again .",
    "because of the escape , it will miss @xmath5 bumping opportunities and end up one gap from the displacement path .",

    "our discrete model and the estimates presented in this paper suggest that particles of twice the size of the geometrical critical size of the @xmath85 bumper device behave diffusively and are not affected by the bumpers because the small diffusive particles rarely come into contact with the bumpers due to random browninan motion .",
