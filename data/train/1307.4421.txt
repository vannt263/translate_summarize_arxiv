    "@xcite found that , when multiplied by a factor of three , the frequency distribution of the lct velocities demonstrates a very good agreement with the distribution of the velocities derived directly from the simulated set ( see figure 13 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , figure 7 in @xcite suggests that the time cadence of 10 - 30  s and the apodization window of 600 - 1000  km are the best choice for analysis of the inter - granular dynamics .",
    "interestingly , the narrower window of 400  km results in diminishing of the lct velocities and degradation of the fine structures in the velocity pattern , so that the lct technique fails to capture the inter - granular dynamics there .",
    "figures 4 - 6 in @xcite , as well as figure 3 in @xcite demonstrate that the extension of the accumulation interval @xmath34 results in diminishing of the lct velocities as well .",
    "the authors found that in order to reveal the persistent ( e.g. , meso- granular and/or super - granular ) flows in the solar granulation , the accumulation time should be no less than approximately 20 minutes .",
    "one might conclude that shorter time intervals should be employed to reveal inter- granular dynamics .    here",
    "we focus on analysis of inter - granular dynamics , i.e. , on proper motions of granule edges , mini - granules @xcite , inter - granular bright points ( bps ) and filigree - like features . according to mhd simulations @xcite and",
    "nst observations , these features visible inside inter - granular lanes are mostly associated with strong quiet sun magnetic fields .",
    "it is thought that alfven waves are generated by rapid displacements of magnetic footpoints driven by these inter - granular flows and the energy - containing scale should be related to this kind of motions .",
    "we will choose the lct configuration parameters based on the above considerations and the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the version of the lct used here was elaborated by @xcite and @xcite and it is utilizing ana software package . we start with choosing the best time cadence @xmath33 using the ch-2012 - 06 - 04 data recorded with time cadence of 13  s. we generated two additional sets with @xmath36 39 and 65  s by selecting each third and fifth image , respectively . in this case , with @xmath3710  min and @xmath38540  km , we obtained the following values of the square root of the averaged squared velocities : 1.21  km s@xmath39 for @xmath33=13  s , 0.61  km s@xmath39 for @xmath33=39  s , and 0.26  km s@xmath39 for @xmath33=65  s. we thus concluded that the first estimate of the lct velocity ( 1.21  km s@xmath39 derived for @xmath33=13  s ) is the best choice because it is the largest one out of the three and the closest one to the estimates derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure 8) for the range of @xmath33 = 10 - 30  s and @xmath35 = 600 - 1000  km .",
    "the next critical parameter is the fwhm of the gaussian sampling window @xmath35 . according to @xcite and @xcite , the choice of @xmath35",
    "must be guided by the spatial scales of the studied dynamic events . in case of the inter - granular scale events ,",
    "the window should not exceed the typical size of a granule , i.e , @xmath281000  km . we thus tested three choices of @xmath35 : 10@xmath1310 pixels ( 270  km in linear extent ) , 20@xmath1320 pixels ( 540  km ) , and 40@xmath1340 pixels ( 1090  km ) for which we obtained the following square root of the averaged squared velocities : 1.02  km s@xmath39 for @xmath38 270  km , 1.21  km s@xmath39 for @xmath38 540  km , and 1.11  km s@xmath39 for @xmath38 1090  km .",
    "again , we chose the @xmath38 540  km value since it ensures the largest detected velocities .    finally , the accumulation ( averaging ) time interval @xmath34 should be shorter than 20 minutes .",
    "similarly , four choices of @xmath34 were tested : 2 , 5 , 10 , and 20  min .",
    "the following square root of the averaged squared velocities were obtained : 1.71 , 1.40 , 1.21 , and 1.06  km s@xmath39 , respectively .",
    "qualitatively , the tendency here agrees with that reported by @xcite and @xcite : the averaged velocity decreases as @xmath34 increases . however , there is no indication which one might be closer to the real value .",
    "the possible answer is that all of them are true , and they simply reflect the dynamics on different time scales .",
    "we , therefore , decided to proceed using all of the above accumulation intervals .    as we saw above , underestimation of the lct velocities by 2 to 3 times",
    "is an unavoidable shortcoming of the lct technique .",
    "however , in this particular study , we are focused on calculation of the correlation functions characterizing lct velocities structures rather than on the magnitude of the velocities . according to the general expression of the correlation function ( see eq.[br ] below ) , multiplying",
    "the velocity ( or squared velocities ) by a constant factor does not change the correlation function ( the factor evenly appears in the numerator and the denominator of the right - hand part of eq .",
    "[ br ] ) .",
    "note , that the tio spectral line is formed in the quiet sun at optical depths of @xmath40 , i.e. , near the continuum level @xcite , where the lct is expected to perform in the most reliable way @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to find , following @xcite , @xmath22convenient measures of the linear extent of the region within which velocities [ as well as squared velocities and magnetic field ] are appreciably correlated@xmath22 . for an arbitrary two - dimensional scalar field @xmath41",

    "angle brackets denote averaging over the area of an image . based on @xmath42 ,",
    "the characteristic length of the field @xmath47 can be defined as a distance where some correlation in @xmath47 holds .",
    "we will use three different approaches for deriving the characteristic length from the correlation function @xmath48 . for a noise - free smooth image , measured on a large enough area ,",
    "all of our approaches produce the same magnitude for the characteristic length .",
    "however , in case of real data , the estimates from different methods might differ .",
    "we will consider the results obtained from these approaches as independent estimates of the characteristic length for a given image .    the first approach is to determine the integral scale @xcite @xmath49 which has also been used in the formulation / derivation of the turbulence transport model of @xcite . here",
    "the integration is supposed to be performed over all scales up to infinity .",
    "however , in the case of real data , at scales exceeding a certain large distance , data noise might cause a non - diminishing @xmath42 , thus resulting in an artificially large integral scale . to mitigate this problem , the signal in pixels was assigned to be zero when the absolute value of the measured signal was below one standard deviation .",
    "moreover , we noticed that in our data sets an increase in correlation is observed at scales larger than approximately 5 mm , which is caused by the presence of adjacent features in a studied field . to avoid an overestimation of the integral length",
    ", we adopted @xmath50 in eq .",
    "[ integ ] to be 5  mm .",
    "the second method is to approximate the correlation function near the origin @xcite : @xmath51 thus , when @xmath48 is fitted with an exponential function , the correlation function drops by @xmath6 times at a scale @xmath5 .",
    "this scale is called the correlation length in the percolation @xcite and in second - order phase transition theories .",
    "finally , the characteristic length can also be determined via the @xmath6-folding scale of @xmath48 without any approximation of the latter ( the scale , where the _ measured _ correlation function drops by @xmath6 times ) .",
    "we denote this measure as @xmath7 .",
    "the parameters introduced above @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 are considered as proxies for the characteristic length , and were calculated for all data sets .",
    "dividing the resulting lct displacements in each pixel by the accumulation time @xmath34 , we obtained components of the transverse velocities @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( flow maps ) .",
    "we then computed the probability distribution functions ( pdfs , figure [ fig3 ] ) of @xmath52 and @xmath53 for each flow map ,    = 5.0truein    which showed that alignment of the images in the data sets was very good , and there are no large - scale systematic shifts , so that residual large - scale velocities ( mean velocities ) are negligible .",
    "indeed , the pdfs of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 components are well centered at zero and are distributed in accordance with a gaussian function .",
    "the mean velocity components @xmath54 and @xmath55 do not exceed 35 m s@xmath39 in any flow map .",

    "the parallel correlation function yields a characteristic length for the velocity fluctuations of 803@xmath12157  km , whereas the characteristic length derived from the normal correlation function is 1307@xmath12278  km .",
    "as the spatial resolution improves , the correlation function for @xmath76 becomes narrower and yields smaller estimates of the characteristic length .",
    "since the correlation functions of @xmath76 and @xmath3 are similar , one might expect that with improved solar instruments , @xmath3 might well produce smaller estimates for @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we may perhaps regard the magnitudes of @xmath0 reported here as an upper limit only .",
    "certainly , the study described here warrants further investigation using better magnetic field data .",
    "for example , the velocity and transverse magnetic field measurements should refer to a ch area , whereas in this study , the transverse magnetic field fluctuations were obtained for a quiet sun region .",
    "however , we may be obtaining realistic estimates because , as it is shown in figure [ fig8 ] , the correlation functions for ch and the quiet sun areas are rather similar and produce similar estimates of the characteristic length .",
    "it would be also useful to compare the lct results with those derived from the tracking of magnetic elements .",
    "this task requires high cadence and a long series of magnetic fields measured inside chs , and is left for a future study .",
    "we have shown that the characteristic length of the energy - containing structures in the photosphere lies in the range of 600 - 2000  km , which is on average an order of magnitude lower than the values used currently in models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "taking into account that the nonlinear dissipation terms in the mhd equations ( eq.(1 ) in @xcite ) , is inversely proportional to the correlation length of energy containing structures at the base of the corona ( see eq.16 in @xcite ) , our results here play a critical role in determining the effectiveness of the coronal turbulence transport models in heating the solar corona and hence in driving the solar wind .",
    "it is worthy to note that obtained estimates of the averaged transverse velocity ( about 1.2 km s@xmath39 ) and the characteristic length scale for @xmath1-fluctuations ( about 1300 km ) , combined with the results of @xcite allowed us to evaluate the turbulent magnetic diffusivity and cross - helicity in the photosphere . indeed ,",
    "when the above estimates are used in the expression for turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath84 , it gives us @xmath85 500 @xmath12 200 km@xmath86 s@xmath39 ( @xmath87 cm@xmath86 s@xmath39 ) . in turn , the cross - helicity , according to eqs .",
    "19,24 in @xcite , is in direct proportion with @xmath89 .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the magnitude of the cross - helicity ( 1 g km s@xmath39 ) obtained by @xcite with @xmath90 cm@xmath86 s@xmath39 , might be at least five times larger .",
    "the importance of the cross - helicity for estimation of internal solar parameters needed for dynamo was emphasized by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the magnitude of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity obtained here in a ch for the spatial scale of @xmath281300  km coincides with the value of @xmath89 inferred from the spectrum of the turbulent diffusion coefficient in a ch on scale of 1000 - 1300  km ( 460 - 560km@xmath86 s@xmath39 ) , reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "10 there ) .",
    "thus , our present results indirectly support the previous inference that the turbulent diffusivity is a scale - dependent parameter .",
    "additionally , the agreement between two independent estimates of @xmath89 argues for the reliability of the lct technique .",
