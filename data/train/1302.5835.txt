    "the study of transport properties in materials has important applications in the technological realm . with the advent of metamaterials [ ] , it has been demonstrated that such transport properties can be controlled by modifying the structure of solids .",
    "both compositional and geometrical parameters play a significant role in the design of new materials . from the standpoint of physical phenomena",
    ", we distinguish the remarkable properties of photonic [ ] and phononic crystals [ ] , which emulate many features of electronic transport in solids : the presence of bandgaps , the appearance of conical points in the frequency spectrum of multilayered structures and the realization of effective dirac equations in lattices [ ] are just a few examples .",
    "the aforementioned properties usually depend on the periodicity of the assembled structures , including quantum - mechanical realizations in one dimension . such examples of tight - binding chains can be found in polymers [ ] and even in the modern construction of optical lattices [ ] . in this paper we go further and introduce disorder as another ingredient , with the purpose of constructing more flexible configurations .",
    "we show that the lowest energy band of waveguides with randomly oriented segments possesses the spectral properties of periodic structures , such as bandgaps , conical points ( or dirac points ) and a conductance band .",
    "these are clear indications of robustness under disorder .    in connection with two - dimensional open systems [ ] and non - integrable billiards , we should mention that in some cases",
    ", randomly disposed boundaries and potentials [ ] give rise to wave - like manifestations of chaos [ ] in the form of level statistics [ ] among other signatures .",
    "additionally , anderson localization [ ] stands as one of the unmistakable signatures of disorder , affecting the corresponding transport properties .    in our study",
    "we establish a result in the opposite direction , namely that low energy waves in systems with corners are _ immune  _ to the effects of disorder , with no localized modes in the lowest frequency band and a non - vanishing conductance band below threshold .",
    "in fact , the examples studied in this paper recover one of the paradigms of integrability and solvability : the homogeneous tight - binding chain with nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "the presence of corners in our disordered waveguides is of utmost importance .",
    "chains of connected resonators can be proposed in many ways [ ] , but the shape of such resonators and the number of supported resonances inside them has an important effect in the complete system , perhaps in a rather uncontrolled manner . the fact that a corner connecting two leads at a right angle allows only one bound state can be used to our favor .",
    "the trapping mechanism of a corner is of a purely wave - like nature and manifests itself at the lowest part of the spectrum , where the wavelenghts are larger than the width of the guides .",
    "the presence of bound states in corners was first noted in [ ] and their description was developed in [ ] by means of conformal maps and effective potentials .    in this paper",
    "we study the spectrum , eigenfunctions and dimensionless conductance of disordered waveguides with corners . as an important result we obtain transmission below the threshold of a straight waveguide ( section iii ) , forming a low frequency band located around the single trapped mode of an isolated corner or l - shaped waveguide and producing a gap which extends from the edge of the lowest band to the straight - guide propagation threshold .",
    "several realizations of two dimensional pipes are obtained by varying the orientations of their segments , showing thus the robustness and flexibility of the system .",
    "then we give an analytical explanation of these effects by finding the effective interaction of a wave with a corner through a conformal map and proceed to connect corners in tigh - binding schemes ( section iv ) .",
    "we finish with a summary and an outlook ( section v ) .",
    "we are interested in the transport properties of two - dimensional waveguides with corners bent at right angles and randomly oriented segments .",

    "these blocks are randomly alternated as one moves along the array , with the only condition the array contains no loops .",
    "the resulting configurations are almost horizontal , minimizing the space .",
    "we relax this condition in model 2 .",
    "the parameters are the following : @xmath2 is width of the waveguide , @xmath3 is the length of the straight segments in units of @xmath2 , @xmath4 is the number of unit cells ( @xmath1 or @xmath0 ) forming the guide , the quantity @xmath5 is the probability of finding @xmath0 cells ( for many realizations this is roughly the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 cells ) .",
