    "spiral arms are the most prominent features in disk galaxies .",
    "as the interstellar medium ( ism ) passes through the moderate gravitational potential well of the stellar spiral arms , it is strongly compressed and shocked , producing narrow dust lanes in optical images .",
    "active star formation is subsequently triggered in high - density clouds inside the arms , resulting in downstream optical arms that contain ob associations and giant regions distributed in a `` beads on a string '' fashion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "other arm substructures include filamentary gaseous spurs ( or feathers ) seen in optical extinction , ir emission from dust , and h@xmath7 emission from star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) , and giant molecular associations and atomic superclouds seen in co and radio observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the locations of these arm substructures downstream from the primary dust lanes indicates that the shock compression represents the first step in an evolutionary sequence that begins with diffuse ism gas and ends with star formation ( for strongly - bound cores ) and dispersal ( for more weakly self - gravitating structures ) , although it is uncertain whether spiral arms actually enhance star formation rate or just organize it ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    studies of galactic spiral shocks date back to @xcite , who used a semi - analytic approach to obtain one - dimensional , stationary shock profiles as functions of the distance perpendicular to the shocks ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite used time - dependent calculations to show that spiral shocks in local models indeed develop within one or two crossings of the background arm potential .",
    "this and subsequent work ( e.g. @xcite ) suggests spiral arm shocks in the one - dimensional approximation are highly stable for a range of the arm strength . on the other hand ,",
    "spiral shocks have been shown to be intrinsically unstable when the vertical dimension is included @xcite . since the arm - to - arm crossing periods are in general incommensurable with the vertical oscillation periods , the gas streamlines are not closed , giving rise to shock flapping motions that dump a significant amount of random kinetic energy in the gas @xcite .",
    "under certain ( strong compression ) conditions , two - dimensional _ in - plane _ spiral shocks can also become unstable due to strong shear within the arm @xcite . however , these in - plane modes are stabilized by moderate magnetic fields @xcite , and suppressed in fully three - dimensional models due to vertical dynamics @xcite .",
    "inclusion of gaseous self - gravity tends to enhance the arm response and symmetrize the density profile @xcite , and causes the shock front to move downstream relative to the minimum in the potential @xcite .",
    "high post - shock density enhances the growth of self - gravitating perturbations within spiral arms , although postshock flow expansion can limit this growth @xcite . using two - dimensional simulations with both self - gravity and magnetic fields",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that magneto - jeans instability ( in which magnetic tension forces counterbalance the stabilizing coriolis forces ) leads to the formation of both arm spurs and gmas / gmcs with realistic properties ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent studies including three - dimensional effects @xcite and global spiral structure @xcite have confirmed these findings .",
    "while recent work has improved our understanding of galactic spiral shocks and their larger substructures , these studies have oversimplified the ism thermodynamics , usually adopting an isothermal equation of state .",
    "this ignores potential consequences of thermal instability ( ti ) ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for review ) , which changes an otherwise homogeneous ism to clumpy , multi - phase gas .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the classical two - phase picture of the ism ,",
    "cold dense clouds are in pressure equilibrium with warm intercloud media that surround them @xcite .",
    "supernovae lead to a hot , diffuse third phase @xcite , but because massive star formation is spatially correlated and much of the hot gas produced is vented away , most of the volume remains relatively unaffected ( e.g. ) .",
    "since the cold clouds and the warm intercloud gas differ in density and temperature by about two orders of magnitudes , their respective responses to spiral shocks and downstream expansion flows will be much different from the isothermal case .",
    "when realistic thermal processes are considered , for instance , warm rarefied gas in the interarm region can be converted via shocks to cold dense gas in the arm regions .",
    "the reverse phase transition can then occur downstream for some fraction of the mass , yielding a quasi - steady cyclic exchange .",
    "@xcite were the first to study the effects of gas cooling and heating on spiral shocks . by considering a mixture of the comoving two stable phases and allowing for phase transitions",
    ", they calculated steady - state shock profiles for both cold and warm phases .",
    "however , they employed a pressure - density relation , instead of solving the time - dependent energy equation , based on the assumption of instantaneous thermal equilibrium ; this precluded the possibility of unstable - phase gas in their calculations .",
    "more recent years have seen a few numerical studies of spiral shocks with explicit heating and cooling , but most of these suffer from strong numerical diffusion .",
    "@xcite argued that allowance for thermal phase changes produces `` accretion fronts / waves '' instead of spiral shocks , in which the inflowing material radiates its energy away .",
    "as they mentioned , however , this result could be due to large numerical diffusion ; we will indeed show below that in a moving medium , numerical conductivity can be large enough to suppress ti . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have shown that some models develop spiral shocks in which phase transitions from warm interarm gas to cold arm clouds occur , although insufficient resolution in their models made the cloud sizes and separations significantly overestimated and prevented the transition regions from cold to warm phases from being resolved .",
    "very recently , @xcite and @xcite studied the effects of the warm phase on a pre - existing cold phase using particle simulations , but they did not allow for phase transitions that are crucial in spiral shocks with ti .    in this paper , we initiate a study of galactic spiral shocks subject to ism heating and cooling , using very high - resolution numerical hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we consider one - dimensional models that represent slices perpendicular to the arm .",
    "we ignore the gaseous self - gravity and magnetic fields here , deferring studies of these effects to future work .",
    "our primary objectives are to determine overall shock structures under ti , to explore where and how the transitions among the cold , warm , and unstable phases occur , and to find statistical properties such as temperature distributions , mass fractions , and velocity dispersions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we describe the basic equations we solve and present our model parameters and numerical methods . in  3 we test our numerical code and quantify the diffusion ( due to translational motion over the grid ) in terms of a numerical conductivity . in ",
    "4 we address the evolution of cold and warm phases as they traverse spiral shocks , and provide statistical measures to quantify the exchange cycle that develops . finally , we summarize our results and discuss their implications in  5 .",
    "we study galactic gas flows and thermodynamic evolution in response to an external stellar spiral potential , which is assumed to be tightly wound with a pitch angle @xmath8 , and rotating at a constant pattern speed @xmath9 with respect to an inertial frame . for local simulations , it is advantageous to set up a frame corotating with the spiral pattern , centered at the position @xmath10 .",
    "the local frame is tilted by an angle @xmath11 relative to the radial direction in such a way that the two orthogonal axes correspond to the directions perpendicular ( @xmath12-axis ) and parallel ( @xmath13-axis ) to the local arm segment , respectively @xcite .",
    "we assume that all physical variables depend only on the @xmath12-coordinate , while allowing nonzero velocity in the @xmath13-direction . since the independent variable in our local models is a projection of the position on a streamline in a large - scale flow onto the @xmath12-axis , the distance on the @xmath12-axis divided by @xmath14 represents the distance that the flow has traversed in the azimuthal direction along the streamline .",
    "therefore , the _ temporal _ interval between one arm crossing and the next crossing is the same as it would be for a global model .    in the local arm frame ,",

    "selected results are shown in figure  [ fig : vis ] .",
    "evidently , larger viscosity tends to produce a weaker spiral shock , with a peak that is more symmetric and farther downstream . in terms of the strength and placement of the spiral arm , an isothermal model with @xmath172 and @xmath6 provides a fairly good match for the mean density profile when ti is included . the isothermal viscous model , however , has a slightly broader arm compared to the time average of the multiphase model .",
    "our results thus demonstrate that ( for the purposes of obtaining a lower - resolution `` beam averaged '' profile ) the effects of clouds embedded in a warm medium can be effectively modeled by viscosity @xcite , but only if the medium s temperature and the mean free path are chosen appropriately .",
    "we note that if a temperature comparable to that of the warm medium were adopted for an isothermal counterpart , the shock would generally be too weak .",

    "comparing to model su2 as shown in figure  [ fig : tevol ] , figure  [ fig : high_n ] shows that the densities ( and temperatures ) of the cold and warm phases after ti saturates are insensitive to the initial gas density , although of course models with higher @xmath0 produce more cold clumps . to be given approximately by @xmath174 , where @xmath175 and @xmath176 are the mean size and number density of the clouds . from simulations with differing @xmath0",
    ", we empirically found that @xmath177 , i.e. the mean cloud size ( presumably set by merging and splitting ) , depends only weakly on @xmath0 .",
    "this gives @xmath178 .",
    "] the ensuing development of spiral shocks and evolutionary tracks in the @xmath82@xmath151 plane are also qualitatively similar to those described in the previous subsection .",
    "perhaps the most notable difference in the late - time states with different @xmath0 is the size of the postshock transition zone .",
    "columns ( 3)-(8 ) of table  [ tbl : model ] show that the transition zone ( and also the arm region , to a lesser extent ) widens with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "one can easily see this by comparing figures  [ fig : sat]d and [ fig : high_n ] .",
    "this trend is of course because models with larger @xmath0 have a larger fraction of the total mass in the cold phase that evaporates to maintain an unstable state .",
    "in addition , the mean separation of cold clouds inside the arm is smaller in models with higher @xmath0 , allowing for merging with neighboring clouds more often during the postshock expansion stage .",
    "this reduces the expansion rate effectively , thereby extending the size of zones with unstable density toward downstream .",
    "unlike the su models , the sw and sc models initially have a low- or high - enough density that they are thermally stable and the early development of a spiral shock takes place in a single - phase medium .",
    "nevertheless , the shock compression and/or post - shock expansion can still produce thermally unstable gas if the initial density is not far from the unstable range .",
    "for example , the shock in model sw0.5 drives the thermal pressure above @xmath179 , and the gas evolves rapidly via ti into a cold stable phase inside the arm . in model sc10 ,",
    "on the other hand , strong post - shock expansion drives the pressure of the initially cold gas below @xmath180 , after which a fraction of the gas expands to become a warm phase .",
    "consequently , the resulting structures at late times in models sw0.5 and sc10 are similar to those in the su models . in models with @xmath0 further away from the unstable values , however , changes in the gas pressure due to shock compression and postshock expansion are insufficient to trigger phase transitions . figure  [ fig : single ] plots equilibrium shock profiles in models sw0.1 and sc20 , which start with @xmath181 and @xmath182 , respectively .",
    "the gas in both of these models consists only of the warm or cold phase and the profiles are smooth everywhere except at the shock front .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdf ] plots the volume - weighted and mass - weighted temperature probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for models sw0.5 , su2 , su5 , and sc10 , averaged over @xmath169 .",
    "the vertical dotted lines in each panel indicate @xmath153 and @xmath154 , marking the cold , intermediate - temperature , and warm phases . for the standard model su2",

    ", the portion of gas with @xmath185 corresponds to the very dense arm population immediately behind the shock , while the portion with @xmath186 includes both arm and interarm cold clouds .",
    "since a larger initial density implies a larger initial cold fraction even before the spiral potential is applied , the cold mass fractions in both arm and interarm regions increase in models with larger @xmath0 . for model sw0.5 , on the other hand , introduction of the spiral potential allows only a small fraction of the gas to exceed @xmath180 and undergo ti , resulting in a lower cold peak and a higher warm peak than in model su2 .",

    "figure  [ fig : pdf ] shows that the distribution of the intermediate phase is almost flat for model su2 and increasingly favors lower temperature as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is because models with larger @xmath0 have a slower post - shock expansion rate , and thus more gas near @xmath153 .",
    "the mean density and density - weighted mean temperature of the intermediate - temperature gas are found to scale as @xmath189 and @xmath190 for @xmath191 , where @xmath192 and @xmath0 are in units of @xmath193 . for the cold and warm phases , the mean values are @xmath194 , and @xmath195 , almost independent of @xmath0 .",

    "this is mainly because of the numerical conductivity associated with a large zone size for small @xmath196 , as explained in ",
    "[ sec : numc ] . when numerical conductivity is large , the boundary layers in between the cold and warm phases thicken in proportion to the field length .",
    "this increase in the intermediate - temperature mass ( in the interarm ) occurs primarily at the expense of the cold phase @xcite .",
    "in addition , large numerical conductivity tends to suppress ti in the post - shock transition zone , yielding less cold gas .",
    "overall , the broadening of interarm cloud interfaces in low resolution models is responsible for 80% of the increase in the intermediate - temperature mass , while the remaining 20% is due to the suppression of ti in the post - shock transition zone .",
    "there is no interarm cold gas in models with @xmath198 , while arm cold gas still exists in these lowest resolution models since the post - shock regions are , when fully resolved , denser and broader than interarm clouds , and thus are less affected by zone averaging . as long as @xmath199 , the numerical conductivity becomes comparable to , or smaller than , the physical conductivity , and the results",
    "are numerically well resolved . because most of the difference between moderate and high resolution models is at warm / cold interfaces ,",
    "the extremely high resolutions that we find are needed for accurate measurement of the thermally - unstable mass fraction would not be required for studies that focus primarily on shock dynamics .",
    "we find that the overall shock structure ( in terms of the breadth of the transition zone , and the time - averaged profiles ) are comparable to those in the converged models provided @xmath200 . at these moderate resolutions , edges of individual clouds are smeared out , but the physically - important transition zone downstream from the arm is still recovered .    in the case of model su2 ,",
    "the converged values of the mass fractions are 59% , 14% , and 27% for the cold , warm , and intermediate - temperature phases , respectively . by volume",
    "the cold takes up 4% of the total , while the warm and intermediate - temperature media occupy 70% and 26% . since these proportions are 80% , 10% , and 10% by mass and 10% , 80% , and 10% by volume when the spiral potential is weak or absent ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : tevol]b ) , this implies that spiral shocks and subsequent post - shock expansion zone are important for populating the intermediate - temperature portion of the phase plane .",
    "columns ( 9)(14 ) of table  [ tbl : model ] give the converged values of the mass and volume fractions of each phase in models with multiple phases .",
    "figure  [ fig : mf_ndep ] plots these proportions as functions of the initial number density @xmath0 .",

    "these estimates are overall in good agreement with the simulation results .      finally , we quantify the level of random gas motions driven in our models due to ti and spiral potential perturbations .",
    "spiral arms produce gas streaming motions that are ordered but vary perpendicular to the shock front .",
    "since streaming velocities are much larger in amplitude than the true random motions , care is needed in measuring the latter .",
    "in addition , while the overall shock profiles reach a quasi - steady state after @xmath214 , several other effects make it difficult to measure turbulent amplitudes in multiphase models : randomly - placed cold clouds move with varying speeds in the interarm region , new structures are continuously developing in the transition zone , and the spiral shocks themselves undergo small - amplitude oscillations perpendicular to the shock front .",
    "to separate out the background streaming from the total velocity as cleanly as possible , we first construct velocity template profiles @xmath215 and @xmath216 for each model , where the angle brackets denote a time average over @xmath169 .",

    "these variations of @xmath224 and @xmath225 are due to small - amplitude oscillations offsetting the spiral shock front from its mean position . since streaming varies strongly within the arm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sat]d , e ) , the offset of the shock position leads to large differences between instantaneous and mean streaming velocities within the arm ; these contaminate the measured velocity dispersion at locations near the shock front . during the quasi - periodic oscillations of the spiral shock front",

    "the overall dynamics and flow characteristics of spiral shocks with ti remain similar to those of isothermal spiral shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the salient features of spiral shocks with thermal evolution include the facts that they allow phase transitions at the shock front ( from warm to cold ) and in the post - shock transition zone ( from cold to warm ) , and that there are cold clumps in the interarm region . given the very high density and pressure within the arm , cold gas downstream from the shock front would transform to molecular clouds if self - gravity and chemical reactions for molecule formation were included . by running sph simulations with separate cold and warm `` particles ''",

    "@xcite also find that about half of the remaining atomic gas is consistent with being thermally - stable wnm , while the balance is in the unstable temperature range 500 - 5000k .",
    "these fractions are also comparable to what we find for @xmath258 . the presence of thermally - unstable gas has been interpreted as owing to dynamical effects which act on timescales comparable to the heating and cooling times .",
    "dynamical processes that have been investigated include magnetorotational instability @xcite , colliding flows @xcite , energy injection from ob stars @xcite , and supernova explosions @xcite . here",
    ", we have shown that even without these additional small - scale energy sources , a significant amount of intermediate - temperature gas forms as a natural product of large - scale spiral shocks with ti , primarily in the expanding region downstream from the arm .",
    "many numerical studies of ti have shown that turbulent amplitudes driven by `` pure ti '' _ alone _ are quite small .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that pure ti in an initially static , uniform medium in thermal equilibrium produces only a modest level of random gas motions , @xmath259 .",
    "@xcite similarly found that ti of gas starting from thermal equilibrium , or with time - dependent heating , results in only subsonic turbulence , @xmath260 when the cold gas dominates .",

    "these velocities are much lower than those we found in previous ( isothermal ) simulations @xcite in which the vertical shock structure is resolved , however .",
    "evidently , shock flapping offers a more effective means of converting galactic rotation to turbulence than simple in - plane oscillations .",

    "<S> using one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including interstellar heating , cooling , and thermal conduction , we investigate nonlinear evolution of gas flow across galactic spiral arms . we model the gas as a non - self - gravitating , unmagnetized fluid , and follow its interaction with a stellar spiral potential in a local frame comoving with the stellar pattern . </S>",
    "<S> initially uniform gas with density @xmath0 in the range @xmath1 rapidly separates into warm and cold phases as a result of thermal instability ( ti ) , and also forms a quasi - steady shock that prompts phase transitions . after saturation </S>",
    "<S> , the flow follows a recurring cycle : warm and cold phases in the interarm region are shocked and immediately cool to become a denser cold medium in the arm ; post - shock expansion reduces the mean density to the unstable regime in the transition zone and ti subsequently mediates evolution back into warm and cold interarm phases . for our standard model with @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the gas resides in the dense arm , thermally - unstable transition zone , and interarm region for 14% , 22% , 64% of the arm - to - arm crossing time . </S>",
    "<S> these regions occupy 1% , 16% , and 83% of the arm - to - arm distance , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> gas at intermediate temperatures ( i.e.  neither warm stable nor cold states ) represents @xmath3 - 30% of the total mass , similar to the fractions estimated from observations ( larger interarm distances could reduce this mass fraction , whereas other physical processes associated with star formation could increase it ) . despite transient features and multiphase structure , the time - averaged shock profiles can be matched to that of a diffusive isothermal medium with temperature @xmath4 ( which is @xmath5 ) and `` particle '' mean free path of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we quantify numerical conductivity associated with translational motion of phase - separated gas on the grid , and show that convergence of numerical results requires the numerical conductivity to be comparable to or smaller than the physical conductivity . </S>"
