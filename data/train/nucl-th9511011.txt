    "the study of the role of strangeness degrees of freedom in low energy nuclear physics is of high current interest since it should lead to a deeper understanding of the relevant strong interaction mechanisms in the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "for example , the system of a strange baryon ( hyperon @xmath8 ) and a nucleon ( @xmath9 ) is in principle an ideal testing ground to investigate the importance of @xmath10 symmetry for the hadronic interactions .",
    "this symmetry is obviously broken already by the different masses of hadrons sitting in the same multiplet .",
    "however the important question arises whether ( on the level of hadrons ) it is broken not only kinematically but also dynamically , e.g.  in the values of the coupling constants at the hadronic vertices .",
    "the answer can not be given at the moment since the present empirical information about the @xmath11 interaction is too scarce and thus prevents any definite conclusions .",
    "hopefully the situation will be improved by experiments of elastic @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and even @xmath14 , currently performed at kek  @xcite .",
    "existing meson exchange models of the @xmath11 interaction assume for the hadronic coupling constants at least @xmath6 symmetry , in case of models a and b of the jlich group  @xcite even @xmath15 of the static quark model .",
    "this symmetry requirement provides relations between coupling constants of a meson multiplet to the baryon current , which strongly reduce the number of free model parameters .",
    "specifically , coupling constants at the strange vertices are then connected to nucleon - nucleon - meson coupling constants , which in turn are fixed between close boundaries by the wealth of empirical @xmath16 scattering information .",
    "all @xmath11 interaction models can reproduce the existing empirical @xmath11 scattering data .",
    "therefore at present the assumption of su(3 ) symmetry for the coupling constants is not in conflict with experiment .",
    "however , the treatment of the scalar - isoscalar meson sector , which provides the intermediate range baryon - baryon interaction , is conceptionally not very convincing so far .",
    "the one - boson - exchange models of the nijmegen group start from the existence of a broad scalar - isoscalar @xmath2 resonance ( @xmath17-meson , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , which is hidden in the experiment ( e.g.  @xmath20 ) under the strong @xmath21-signal and can therefore not be identified reliably . for practical reasons the exchange of this broad @xmath17-meson",
    "is then approximated by the exchange of a sum of two mesons with sharp mass @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; the smaller mass is around @xmath24 and thus corresponds to the phenomenological @xmath0-meson in conventional obe - models .",
    "the @xmath17-meson is then treated as @xmath6 singlet ( model d  @xcite ) or as member of a full nonet of scalar mesons ( model f  @xcite and nsc  @xcite ) . in the @xmath6 framework",
    "the @xmath17-coupling strength is equal for all baryons in model d , while it depends on four open @xmath6 parameters in models f and nsc , which are adjusted to @xmath16 and @xmath11 scattering data . in the latest nijmegen model nsc",
    "@xcite the scalar meson nonet includes apart from the @xmath17 the isoscalar @xmath25 , the isovector @xmath26 and the strange mesons @xmath27 , which the authors identify  @xcite with scalar @xmath28-states predicted by the mit bag model  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is however doubtful , at least for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 . according to a recent theoretical analysis of the @xmath2 , @xmath29 , and @xmath3 system  @xcite in the meson exchange framework",
    "the @xmath25 is a @xmath3 molecule bound in the @xmath2 continuum , while @xmath26 is dynamically generated by the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "thus both mesons do not appear to be genuine quark model resonances , with the consequence that @xmath6 relations should not be applied to these mesons .",
    "( the non - strange members of the scalar nonet are expected to be at higher energies ) .    in the bonn potential  @xcite the intermediate range attraction",
    "is provided by uncorrelated ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1_2]a , b ) and correlated ( fig .  [ fig:1_2]c ) @xmath2 exchange processes with @xmath16 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 intermediate states .",
    "it is known from the study of the @xmath2 interaction that the @xmath2 correlations are important mainly in the scalar - isoscalar and vector - isovector channel .",
    "the bonn potential includes such correlations , however only in a rough way , namely in terms of sharp mass @xmath32 and @xmath1 exchange .",
    "one disadvantage of such a simplified treatment is that this parametrization can not be transported into the hyperon sector in a well defined way .",
    "therefore in the @xmath11 interaction models of the jlich group  @xcite , which start from the bonn @xmath16 potential , the coupling constants of the fictitious @xmath32-meson at the strange vertices ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) are essentially free parameters . in view of the little empirical information about the @xmath11 interaction",
    "this feature is not satisfactory .",
    "this is especially true for an extension of the @xmath11 models to baryon - baryon channels with strangeness @xmath35 .",
    "so far there is no empirical information about these channels ( apart from some data on @xmath36- and @xmath37-hypernuclei ) . still there is a large interest in these channels initiated by the prediction of the h - dibaryon by jaffe  @xcite .",
    "the h - dibaryon is a deeply bound 6-quark state with the same quark content as the @xmath37 system ( @xmath38 ) and with @xmath39 quantum numbers .",
    "for the experimental search it is important to know whether conventional deuteron - like @xmath37 states exist .",
    "an analysis of possible @xmath35 bound states in the meson exchange framework could provide valuable information in this regard , but requires a coupled channels treatment of @xmath37 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 channels .",
    "an extension of the jlich @xmath11 models to those channels is only of minor predictive power since the strength of the important @xmath42 vertex is completely undetermined and can not be fixed by empirical data .",
    "these problems can be overcome by an explicit evaluation of correlated @xmath2 exchange processes in the various baryon - baryon channels .",
    "a corresponding calculation has been done for the @xmath16 case ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1_2]c )  @xcite .",
    "starting point was a fieldtheoretic model for both the @xmath43 born amplitudes and the @xmath2-@xmath3 interaction  @xcite . with the help of unitarity and dispersion relations the amplitude for the correlated @xmath2 exchange in the @xmath16 interaction has been determined , showing characteristic discrepancies to @xmath32 and @xmath1 exchange in the ( full ) bonn potential .",
    "for the correct description of the @xmath2 interaction in the scalar - isoscalar channel the coupling to the @xmath3 channel is essential , which is obvious from the interpretation of the @xmath25 as a @xmath3 bound state .",
    "apart from the @xmath2-@xmath3 interaction model the @xmath3 channel is not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. the coupling of the kaon to the nucleon is not taken into account .",
    "in fact , this approximation is justified in the @xmath16 system  @xcite ; it is however not expected to work in channels involving hyperons .",
    "the aim of the present paper is a microscopic derivation of correlated @xmath2 as well as @xmath3 exchange processes in the various baryon - baryon channels with @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1_1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath3 channel is treated on an equal footing with the @xmath2 channel in order to determine reliably the influence of @xmath3 correlations .",
    "our results replace the phenomenological @xmath32 and @xmath1 exchange in the bonn @xmath16 and jlich @xmath11 models by correlated processes and in this way eliminate undetermined model parameters ( e.g.  @xmath32 coupling constants ) .",
    "corresponding interaction models thus have more predictive power and should make a sensible treatment of @xmath35 baryon - baryon channels possible .",
    "the formal treatment is similar to that of refs .  @xcite dealing with correlated @xmath2 exchange in the @xmath16 interaction .",
    "due to the inclusion of the @xmath3 channel and different baryon masses ( e.g. in the @xmath45 channel ) generalizations are however required at some places .",
    "starting point is a field - theoretic model for the baryon - antibaryon ( @xmath4 ) @xmath46 born amplitudes in the @xmath47 channels . besides various baryon exchange terms the model includes in complete consistency to the @xmath2-@xmath3 interaction model  @xcite also a @xmath1-pole term ( cf .",
    "[ fig:1_3 ] ) .",
    "these born amplitudes are analytically continued into the pseudophysical region below the @xmath4-threshold .",
    "the solution of a covariant scattering equation with full inclusion of @xmath48 correlations yields the @xmath49 amplitudes in the pseudophysical region . in the @xmath43 channel",
    "these amplitudes are then adjusted to quasiempirical information  @xcite , which has been obtained by analytic continuation of @xmath50 and @xmath2 data . with the assumption of @xmath15 symmetry for the coupling constants a parameter - free description of the other particle channels",
    "can then be achieved .    via unitarity relations the products of",
    "@xmath49 amplitudes fix the singularity structure of the baryon - baryon amplitudes for @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange .",
    "assuming analyticity for the amplitudes dispersion relations can be formulated for the baryon - baryon amplitudes , which connect physical amplitudes in the @xmath51-channel with singularities and discontinuities of these amplitudes in the pseudophysical region of the @xmath52-channel processes . with a suitable subtraction of uncorrelated contributions , which are calculated directly in the @xmath51-channel and therefore guaranteed to have the correct energy behavior , we finally obtain the amplitudes for correlated @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange in the baryon - baryon system .    in the next chapter",
