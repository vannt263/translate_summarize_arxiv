    ", it is desirable to find a kind of monogamous qd even in several qubit systems , which on the one hand gives a clear correlation structure but on the other hand allows the characterization of genuine multipartite quantum correlation .    in this paper , we are motivated by the following two questions : ( i ) _ whether or not _ the qd is monogamous in certain form , and ( ii ) _ in what degree _ the discord is monogamous and can characterize the genuine multipartite quantum correlation . to answer these two questions",

    "again , we can see that the sqd is monogamous .",
    "a quantum correlation measure should satisfy the following necessary criteria : ( i ) it should be a non - negative real number ; ( ii ) it is invariant under local unitary operations @xcite ; and ( iii ) it is zero in an @xmath104-partite quantum state if and only if the state is a product state in any bipartite cut @xcite .    based on our previous analysis on the quantum correlation distribution of sqd , we define a tripartite quantum correlation measure as @xmath105 which characterizes the genuine three - qubit quantum correlation in a pure state @xmath21 .",
    "the non - negative property of @xmath106 is satisfied due to the sqd being monogamous .",
    "the tripartite correlation @xmath106 is invariant under local unitary operations because the sqds are unchanged under the transformation .    for the third requirement , we first prove that the measure @xmath107 is zero if a three - qubit state is a product state in any bipartite cut .",
    "when the quantum state has the form @xmath108 , the sqd @xmath109 due to the product property under this partition .",
    "the sqd @xmath110 because we have @xmath111 with @xmath112 being the projector composed of the eigenvector of @xmath113 .",
    "the case for @xmath114 is similar .",
    "so , the genuine tripartite quantum correlation @xmath115 . for the product state @xmath116 , we also have @xmath115 , since @xmath117 and @xmath114 .",
    "similarly , we can derive @xmath115 for @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , @xmath107 is zero when the three - qubit pure state is a product state in any bipartite cut .",
    "next , we prove that when the three - qubit pure state is not a bipartite product under any partition , the measure @xmath106 is always nonzero .",
    "based on the correlation distribution in eq .",
    "( 8) , it is sufficient to prove the term @xmath119 since the second term is nonnegative . for a non - product state @xmath120 ,",
    "its bipartite concurrence @xmath121 is a positive value and we have the ckw relation @xmath122 .",
    "when @xmath123 and @xmath124 , we can obtain that @xmath125 because the entanglement @xmath126 is a monotonically increasing and convex function of the concurrence @xmath53 .",
    "when one of the two - qubit concurrence is zero , for example @xmath127 , the ckw relation is @xmath128 .",
    "according to the monotonic property , we have @xmath125 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath129 should be removed simply because it corresponds to the case that the three - qubit pure state is a product one under the partition @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , @xmath125 if ever the three - qubit state is of nonproduct , implying that the measure @xmath107 is positive .",
    "so far , we have shown that the introduced tripartite quantum correlation measure @xmath107 satisfies all the three necessary criteria .",
    "furthermore , the measure may be understood as the monogamy score difference of sqd between the given state and a bipartite product state , _",
    "@xmath131 where monogamy score is @xmath132 .",
    "when @xmath107 is nonzero , the quantum state is not a product state and its monogamy score is larger than that of any bipartite product state .",
    "the score difference is just the residual sqd .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath107 , the farther the monogamy distance between the give state and the bipartite product state .",
    "therefore the measure @xmath107 can characterize the genuine three - qubit quantum correlation and has a physical explanation in terms of the monogamy score difference .",
    "in addition , for a three - qubit pure state @xmath21 , we can obtain a hierarchy structure of quantum correlations .",
    "as depicted schematically in fig.3 , eq.(25 ) can be rewritten as @xmath133 where @xmath134 quantifies the total quantum correlation in the partition @xmath34 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 quantify two - qubit quantum correlations , and @xmath107 characterizes the genuine three - qubit quantum correlation under the partition @xmath34 .    as an application",
    ", we consider generalized greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and @xmath2 states , which are two inequivalent classes under stochastic local operations and classical communication @xcite .",
    "the generalized @xmath137 state has the form @xmath138 .",
    "its two - qubit quantum correlations are zero because the reduced density matrices @xmath27 are classical states .",
    "therefore , there is only the genuine three - qubit quantum correlation @xmath139 in the generalized @xmath137 state . for the generalized @xmath2 state @xmath140 ,",
    "both two - qubit and three - qubit quantum correlations are nonzero when parameters @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 are nonzero .",
    "when @xmath144 and @xmath145 , the tripartite quantum correlation has the maximal value @xmath146 .    also noting that the qd is asymmetric for different measurement parties , the tripartite quantum correlation under qubit permutation is not equivalent to each other : @xmath147 for a generic quantum state .",
    "from this consideration , we may define a new tripartite quantum correlation measure : @xmath148 where @xmath149 , and the measure may be referred to as the three - qubit mean - sqd .",
    "this mean - sqd not only satisfies all three conditions for a multipartite correlation measure , but also is independent of bipartite partitions , reflecting really the global tripartite quantum correlation in a three - qubit pure state @xmath21 .      in three - qubit mixed states ,",
    "the quantum correlation distribution of sqd is not always monogamous . as an example",

    ", we have the discord @xmath153 where subsystem @xmath154 is equivalent to a logic qubit and the subsystem @xmath155 is the environment degree of freedom purifying the mixed state . because @xmath156 is a rank-2 quantum state , the environment subsystem is equivalent to a logic qubit . in eq .",
    "( 29 ) , we set the parameters @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 .",
    "when the parameters @xmath161 , we can get @xmath162 by using the wootters formula @xcite , which results in @xmath163 . similarly , we have @xmath164 and @xmath165 . substituting these sqds into the correlation distribution @xmath86",
    ", we can determine the value of the distribution is @xmath166 .",
    "although the quantum correlation distribution can be negative , we can still introduce a tripartite quantum correlation indicator whenever the distribution in a mixed state @xmath167 is always monogamous ( an example of this case will be presented in the next section ) .",
    "in this case , we may define the indicator as @xmath168 where @xmath149 .",
    "furthermore , we can introduce a symmetric tripartite correlation indicator @xmath169 which indicates the global tripartite quantum correlation in a three - qubit mixed state .",
    "in four - qubit pure states , the structure of quantum correlation distributions is more complicated than that in three - qubit states . in general , these distributions are not monogamous . however",
    ", if the distributions of sqd are monogamous in a given four - qubit system , we can also construct an indicator of the four - body correlation with the components @xmath170 where the superscript @xmath171 means that the correlation distribution lies in the partition between one qubit and the other three qubits and the case for @xmath172 is the distribution between two two - qubit subsystems . under qubit permutations ,",
    "@xmath173 and @xmath174 have four and six inequivalent components , respectively .",
    "the nonzero component indicates the genuine multipartite quantum correlation in the designated partition of a given state .",
    "for example , in the generalized four - qubit @xmath137 state @xmath175 , the correlation distribution is always non - negative , and we have @xmath176 .",
    "another example is the cluster state @xmath177 @xcite , in which we have @xmath178 and @xmath179 .    at this stage , as an interesting example , we consider the dynamical property of quantum correlations in a real quantum system .",
    "as is known , the dynamical property of a two - qubit quantum correlation has been widely investigated both theoretically and experimentally ( see , for example , refs . @xcite and references therein ) . however , the dynamical property of multipartite quantum correlations is still very challenging .",

    ", we plot different components of multipartite quantum correlation indicators as a function of the time evolution parameter @xmath191 and the initial state amplitude @xmath192 .",
    "it is noted that all the correlation distributions are non - negative and we have @xmath193 and @xmath194 for these components .",
    "when the time @xmath195 , the quantum state is a product state and these indicators are zero .",
    "along with the time evolution , they first increase to their maxima , and then decay asymptotically .",
    "when the parameter @xmath196 , the output state evolves to a product state again and all the multipartite quantum correlations disappear .    in the cavity - reservoir system",
    ", its multipartite entanglement evolution was investigated in refs .",
    "the genuine multipartite entanglement can be characterized by a series of entanglement indicators . here ,",
    "in our analysis , we consider the following components : @xmath197 where @xmath53 is the square of concurrence and the subscripts @xmath198 in the second equation . the component @xmath199 can be used to characterize the genuine multipartite entanglement in the partition @xmath200 , and @xmath201 can indicate the genuine block - block entanglement in the partition @xmath202 @xcite .",

    "however , the peaks of correlation and entanglement do not coincide completely .",
    "the reason is that quantum correlation and quantum entanglement are not equivalent in general .",
    "particularly , in the dynamical procedure , the evolution of two - qubit entanglement can exhibit the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death @xcite , but the corresponding evolution of quantum correlation is always asymptotic . in addition",
    ", the peak values of quantum correlation indicators can be greater ( fig .",
    "5a ) or less ( fig .",
    "5b - d ) than those of quantum entanglement indicators .",
