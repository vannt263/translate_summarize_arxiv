    "the recently - discovered iron - based superconductors @xcite have emerged as a whole new family of high temperature superconductors , which are complimentary to the study of cuprates .",
    "they have attracted intensive study in the community focusing on their physical properties and potential applications .",
    "reminiscent of cuprates , the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase in the parent compounds is suppressed with chemical doping or higher pressure , and it is proposed that superconductivity in iron pnictides may originate from afm fluctuations @xcite . it is pointed out that there are also vital differences in that the afm ground state in the cuprates and fe - pnictides are mott - insulator and metallic , respectively . soon after the discovery of fe - pnicitides , arpes and quantum oscillation measurements have revealed disconnected hole - like bands around the @xmath10 point and electron - like bands around the @xmath11 point on the fs @xcite .",
    "the order parameter ( op ) symmetry in the cuprates has been determined to be @xmath12 , while it is still not known for the iron - pnictides . a first step in unveiling",
    "the mechanism of the new family of superconductors is to determine the pairing symmetry .",
    "an extended s - wave gap structure with a sign reversal ( @xmath13 ) on different fss is proposed by i. mazin @xcite where the hole - like and electron - like bands are fully - gapped and have a @xmath14 phase shift in the superconducting state .",
    "a fully - gapped state has been confirmed by different experimental techniques such as arpes @xcite , penetration depth @xcite , @xmath15sr @xcite , hc@xmath16 @xcite and specific heat measurements @xcite .",
    "however , a universal power law rather than exponential behavior is observed in the london penetration depth measurement for rfeaso@xmath3f@xmath4 ( r = nd , la ) @xcite , and ba(fe@xmath17co@xmath18)@xmath0as@xmath0 at various doping levels @xcite .",
    "the hebel - slichter coherent peak is absent in nmr measurements @xcite and it is argued that is a natural consequence of the extended @xmath13 model in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "point - contact andreev reflection spectroscopy ( pcars ) is a powerful tool to investigate the gap structure and op symmetry in superconductors .",
    "a good example is the case of mgb@xmath0 , where two gaps , originating from @xmath19 and @xmath14 bands , are clearly present in the point - contact spectra , and also through directional pcars measurements , the gap dependences on temperature and magnetic field are systematically revealed @xcite .",
    "park @xmath20 successfully applied pcars to reveal the @xmath12 symmetry of the superconducting op in cecoin@xmath21 @xcite . shortly after the discovery of the superconducting lnfeaso ( fe-1111 ) family ,",
    "some pcars measurements have been carried out , but the results are not yet conclusive , partly due to the polycrystalline nature of the samples .",
    "chen @xmath20 report a conventional bcs - like superconducting gap with @xmath22 for smfeaso@xmath23f@xmath24 @xcite , while multiple gaps are claimed by other groups with different detailed structures in the initial stage @xcite . among those who claim multiple gaps ,",
    "some merging agreements are being reached where 2@xmath252 - 3 and 2@xmath267 - 9 . in this paper",
    ", we apply pcars to different afe@xmath0as@xmath0-type superconducting single crystals to elucidate their gap structure and op symmetry .",
    "afe@xmath0as@xmath0-type ( fe-122 ) parent compound and various superconducting single crystals are grown out of feas flux by a high temperature solution method , such as parent compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0(@xmath27135 k ) , electron - doped superconducting a(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath0as@xmath0(a = ba or sr , @xmath2822 k ) @xcite , and hole - doped superconducting ( ba@xmath1k@xmath6)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath2837 k ) and ( sr@xmath1na@xmath6)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath2835 k)@xcite . the crystals have natural c - axis facets and are cleaved in the air to expose fresh and shiny surfaces before mounting on the sample holder . a sharp au tip prepared by electrochemical etch @xcite",
    "is engaged onto the sample surface with a conventional differential micrometer mechanism @xcite .",
    "the contact between the au normal metal and fe-122 crystals is made after cooling to @xmath82 k. the junction conductance @xmath29 , as a function of the bias voltage @xmath30 , is recorded by the standard ac lock - in technique , where the superconductor is always biased positively .",
    "contacts may be lost due to vibration or instability in thermal contraction . here",
    "we report data obtained after dozens of contacts have been made on each crystal , and some with changing temperature up to the bulk t@xmath31 and magnetic field up to 9 tesla .",
    "two different categories of g(v ) curves are observed for point - contacts on these fe-122 superconducting crystals : ( 1 ) for ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 and ba(fe , co)@xmath0as@xmath0 , andreev reflection signals are observed but distinct from each other ; and ( 2 ) for ( sr , na)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 and sr(fe , co)@xmath0as@xmath0 , in the absence of andreev reflection , a universal power law behavior is seen .",
    "the latter is also observed for the point - contact on the non - superconducting parent compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "results and discussions are presented here for each case separately .      for the ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 crystals , representatives of the most frequently observed g(v ) curves at low temperatures ( @xmath82 k ) are shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the prominent features are the two peaks at @xmath32 mev and a strongly sloping background .",
    "a hump structure can also be noticed around @xmath33 mev as indicated by arrows , and a small conductance asymmetry is systematically observed .",
    "similar broad backgrounds and asymmetries are reported in the recent point - contact measurement on smfeaso@xmath34f@xmath35 , where the sloping background is claimed to disappear around the neel temperature ( @xmath8 140 k ) of the parent compound @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence as shown in figure [ figure2a_2b](a ) verifies that the low - bias conductance enhancement is due to andreev reflection .",
    "although the junction resistance changes with temperature , the andreev reflection signal disappears only above the bulk @xmath36 , giving confidence that we probe the bulk gap .",
    "the sloping background survives above @xmath36 so it does not originate from superconductivity and must be due to some other scattering mechanism .    since the ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 material is known to be reactive in air , we try to minimize exposure time between cleavage and cooldown .",
    "the usual time is about 30 minutes .",
    "we investigate the effect of a 1 week air exposure as shown in figure [ figure2a_2b](b ) .",
    "the andreev reflection signal is lost below 16.6 k , lower than that of the bulk .",
    "this indicates the air exposure degrades the surface and suppresses the superconductivity and that cleavage minimizes the surface degradation .",
    "we note the sloping background does not change with the air exposure .    for the gap analysis",
    ", we normalize the conductance for the cleaved surfaces to the extrapolated baseline as shown in figure [ figure3a_3b](a ) .",
    "the normalized data are then analyzed by the single - gap blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) model @xcite .",
    "the best fit for the energy gap is @xmath37 mev , so @xmath38 , smaller than the bcs weak coupling ratio of 3.52 .",
    "this value is comparable with the smaller gap size probed by pcars on polycrystalline samples of lafeaso@xmath17f@xmath18 @xcite , ndfeaso@xmath3f@xmath4 @xcite , and smfeaso@xmath34f@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we stress that our materials are ",
    "fe-122 \" single crystals , and we probe in the c - axis orientation .",
    "this may account for us not observing the larger gap as follows : an arpes study on ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 reveals an isotropic but fs sheet - dependent gap structure , where the @xmath39 band has an averaged gap size @xmath40 mev with @xmath41 and the @xmath42,@xmath43 and @xmath44 bands have comparable gap sizes around 11 - 13 mev with @xmath45 @xcite . considering the fss from band structure calculations , the @xmath42,@xmath43 and @xmath44 bands are highly 2-dimensional with cylindrical shapes while the @xmath39 band is strongly 3-dimensional due to the @xmath46 component @xcite .",
    "the small gap observed here may correspond to the 3d @xmath39 band . because the fermi velocity on the @xmath42,@xmath43 , and @xmath44 bands is mostly in the ab plane and perpendicular to the c - axis ,",
    "these bands contribute a relatively small spectral weight for current flowing in the c - axis , and the coherent peaks from these larger - gap bands are almost absent in pcars , similar to the case of mgb@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "both gaps should then be observable if junction current is flowing within the ab plane .",
    "szab @xmath20 report two superconducting gaps for pcars measurement in the ab plane with @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "however , andreev reflection is totally absent for their point - contact junctions in c - axis .",
    "this is distinct from our results and may be due to the sample difference .",
    "the elastic and inelastic electron mean free paths , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , are not known for ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals .",
    "however , it is generally believed that they are bad metals and _ l@xmath51 _ could be a few tens of nanometers , making it difficult to form a contact in the sharvin ballistic limit , ( contact diameter d @xmath52",
    "l@xmath51 ) . for the contact in the diffusive regime ( @xmath53 ) , dips may arise from the extra finite resistance of the superconducting electrode when the junction current at a finite voltage bias exceeds the critical current @xcite .",
    "the humps in figure [ figure1 ] are a possible signature of shallow dips , possibly dimmed by the sloping background .",
    "as the point - contact is moved further away from the ballistic regime , the dip structure becomes more pronounced and a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) is observed , rather than the usual double - peak .",
    "this is likely the case as shown in figure [ figure4a_4c](a ) & ( b ) where a zbcp is observed and the dips at @xmath54 10 mev are more pronounced than in figure [ figure1 ] . although a peak at zero bias may arise from andreev bound states in a d - wave superconductor @xcite , the width , the lack of field dependence as shown in figure [ figure4a_4c ] ( c ) , and the pronounced dip structures together indicate the zbcp is due to the contact not being in the sharvin limit .      conductance curves for the point - contact junctions on cleaved ba(fe , co)@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals are shown as a function of contact resistance and temperature in figures [ figure5a_5b](a ) and [ figure5a_5b](b ) , respectively . for most contacts , a conductance enhancement at zero - bias with broad shoulders",
    "is observed .",
    "note that with increasing temperature , the zbcp disappears at the bulk @xmath36 indicating it originates from andreev reflection .",
    "a v - shape g(v ) is obtained when the tip is in gentle contact with the crystal hundreds of ohms junction resistance , and with increased tip pressure reducing the junction resistance , the conductance curve changes to the general zbcp feature .",
    "figure [ figure6a_6d ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the typical g(v ) curves with reduced conductance at lower voltage bias observed for the point - contact junctions on cleaved ( sr , na)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 and sr(fe , co)@xmath0as@xmath0 surfaces .",
    "similar features are also reported by other groups @xcite .",
    "we find the conductance shape does not change up to applied magnetic fields of 9 tesla .",
    "there is no splitting of the zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) in the magnetic field , which may rule out the kondo scattering as an origin .",
    "this zba feature , without andreev reflection , is probably due to the absence of superconductivity in probed areas , even though the samples are checked to be superconducting .",
    "conductance curves with this zba , as shown in figure [ figure6a_6d](c ) , are sometimes observed in the point - contact junctions on cleaved ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 crystals .",
    "we have also observed the same zba feature for the nonsuperconducting parent compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals even up to 200 mev , as shown in figure [ figure6a_6d](d ) , where sdw magnetic order exists .",
    "all the curves can be fit to a power law function @xmath55 with a power coefficient , n @xmath56 .",
    "this may indicate a universal origin of this zba observed commonly among different crystals .    in the bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 parent compound ,",
    "a structure transition occurs at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature , @xmath27135 k. a phase - separated coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity in fe-122 family is reported in recent muon spin rotation ( @xmath15sr ) studies @xcite with a magnetic correlation length @xmath57100  .",
    "park @xmath20 demonstrate the mesoscopic phase - separated coexistence of magnetically ordered and non - magnetic states on a lateral scale of @xmath58 nm in the slightly underdoped ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 system @xcite . whether such coexistence is an intrinsic electronic property for fe-122 system or due to some crystalline inhomogeneity remains uncertain .    in investigating the possibility that the zba originates from magnetic order , we note magnetic order can be detected by pcars @xcite .",
    "a point - contact junction made on a superconducting region would exhibit andreev reflection and one on a nonsuperconducting , magnetically ordered region would not . instead , a signature due to electron scattering from magnetic order may be detected .",
    "this may be the case for ( sr , na)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 and sr(fe , co)@xmath0as@xmath0 where no andreev reflection peak in g(v ) has been observed , and g(v ) curves with the zba are mostly observed .",
    "goko et al .",
    "apply @xmath15sr to investigate ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 and ( sr , na)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals ( same source as ours ) and argue that static magnetism sets in at temperatures well above the superconducting t@xmath31 .",
    "they estimate the superconducting volume fraction to be 50 @xmath59 in ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 crystals and @xmath60 in ( sr , na)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 crystals at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our more frequent observation of zba features in ( sr , na)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 than ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 cystals .",
    "temperature dependent pcars for the parent compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 reveals the zba feature is broadened and reduced with increasing temperature . as the neel temperature ( @xmath27 135 k ) is crossed , no dramatic change in the spectra is observed but thermal population effects may mask changes in conductance due to the magnetic transition .",
    "in conclusion , our pcars measurement on the cleaved ( ba , k)fe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystal surfaces shows a superconducting gap energy of @xmath8 4 mev when g(v ) curves are analyzed by the single - gap btk model . for point - contacts on ba(fe , co)@xmath0as@xmath0 , zero - bias peak",
    "is frequently observed due to andreev reflection .",
    "a universal power law behavior of the g(v ) observed for pcars on different fe-122 superconducting samples may be a natural result of the mesoscopic phase - separated coexistence of magnetic and superconducting phases in the 122 system .",
    "more careful investigation is needed to understand the origin of the power - law zba behavior .",
    "point - contact measurement in the ab - plane would be helpful to explore more detailed gap structure of these new unconventional superconductors .",
