    "it has been found from the theoretical study that the introduction of strange quarks into a plasma with two flavors could lower the fermi energy of the system and thus the mass of quark matter @xcite .",
    "if its mass is lower than the mass of hyperonic matter with the same strangeness fraction , or even lower than the non - strange nucleonic matter , the strange quark matter ( sqm )  would be the true ground state of qcd .",
    "therefore , to search the sqm  in the laboratory is an important task for recent heavy ion collision experiments at ultrarelativistic energy @xcite .",
    "the essential problem for detectability of sqm in heavy ion experiments is to study its stability during the formation of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "many properties of stability of sqm , for example , the  stability window  @xcite , the charge - dependence @xcite and the strangeness fraction - dependence @xcite of stability have been widely discussed by many authors .",
    "they employed different models to investigate this problem .",
    "but unfortunately , many conclusions are different , in particular , part of them , say , the charge dependence is contrary .",
    "the electric charge is of vital importance to the experimental searches of sqm . by means of mit bag model , jaffe and his co - workers",
    "@xcite suggested that the sqm  is slightly positively electric charged .",
    "they considered strong and weak decay by nucleon and hyperon emission together and concluded that the stable sqm will have a low but positive charge to mass ratio . using the same model as that of jaffe et al . but",
    "considering the initial condition of possible strangelet production in relativistic heavy ion collision carefully , greiner and his co - workers @xcite argued that strangelets are most likely highly negatively charged .",
    "they also emphasized that the stability of infinite sqm depends on the bag constant @xmath2 .",
    "an infinite sqm , treated as a gas of noninteracting quarks , is absolutely stable for @xmath3 , and metastable for @xmath4 , but unstable for larger bag constants .",
    "of course , this conflict of conclusions is limited in the framework of mit bag model and at zero temperature .    employing another model , namely , the quark mass density - dependent ( qmdd ) model , peng and his co - workers reconsidered this problem @xcite .",
    "they introduced a critical density and proved that sqm can not maintain its flavor equilibrium , and thus no longer be stable under this critical density .",
    "they found that proper negative charges can lower the critical density and thus make the sqm become more stable .",
    "their conclusion is not surprised if one notice the confinement mechanism of qmdd  model .",
    "in qmdd model , the mass of @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks are given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the baryon number density , @xmath9 is the current mass of the strange quark matter and @xmath2 is the vacuum energy density inside bag ( bag constant ) .",
    "the mechanism of confinement can be mimicked through the hypothesis eqs.([su1 ] ) and ( [ su2 ] ) .",
    "the masses of quarks become infinitely large as the volume increases to infinity or the density decreases to zero .",
    "so that the vacuum is unable to support it @xcite .",
    "noting that the boundary condition of confinement of mit  bag model corresponds to the zero quark mass inside the bag but infinity at the boundary or outside the bag , we see that the confinement mechanisms are similar to these two models . due to this correspondence ,",
    "as pointed out by benrenuto and lugones @xcite , in almost all cases , the properties of sqm  given by qmdd  model are nearly the same as those obtained in the mit bag model . the conclusion of peng et al .",
    "supports the result given by greiner et al .",
    "this paper evolves from an attempt to extend these discussions to finite temperature .",
    "the reasons of this extension are : at first , the sqm might be possible and formed during the phase transition from hadronic matter to a deconfined qgp . from lattice qcd calculations , the phase transition of deconfinement will happen at critical temperature .",
    "secondly , as was pointed out by our previous papers @xcite , qmdd model can not be used to explain the process of the quark deconfinement phase transition because the quark confinement is permanent in this model . instead of this model , a quark mass density- and temperature - dependent ( qmdtd )  model",
    "in which the quark confinement is not permanent has been suggested by us @xcite . as its application",
    ", we hope to employ qmdtd  model to discuss the charge and strangeness fraction dependences of sqm at finite temperature .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in next section , we review the qmdtd  model and give the main formulae which are necessary for studying the thermodynamical behaviors of sqm . in section 3 , we give the result of numerical calculations for qmdtd  model and investigate the stability of hot sqm in detail .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "to overcome the difficulties of qmdd  model which appear at finite temperature , in refs.@xcite , based on the friedberg - lee model@xcite , we suggested a qmdtd model .",
    "the basic difference between our model and qmdd  model is that , instead of a constant @xmath2 in eqs.([su1 ] ) and ( [ su2 ] ) , we argued that @xmath2 must be a function of temperature and choose @xmath10 as    @xmath11 , 0\\leq t\\leq t_c \\label{su3 } \\\\ b & = & 0,\\text { } t > t_c ,   \\label{su4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is bag constant at zero temperature and @xmath13 is the critical temperature of quarks deconfinement . substituting eq.([su3 ] ) into eqs.([su1 ] ) and ( [ su2 ] ) , we find the masses of @xmath14 quarks and their corresponding anti - quarks as @xmath15 , % \\hspace{0.8cm}(q = u , d,\\bar{u},\\bar{d } ) ,   \\label{su5 } \\\\ m_{s,\\bar{s } } & = & m_{s0}+{\\frac{b_0}{3n_b}}\\left [ 1-\\left ( \\frac t{t_c}% \\right ) ^2\\right ] ,   \\label{su6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath16 . when @xmath17 , the masses of quarks are independent of temperature : @xmath18 and @xmath19 . due to the difference between eqs.([su1]),([su2 ] ) and eqs.([su5]),([su6 ] ) , as was proved in ref.@xcite , we found that when @xmath8 approaches to zero , the temperature @xmath20 @xmath21 in our model , but diverges in qmdd model . in qmdtd  model ,",
    "the masses of @xmath22 quarks become zero ( or constant for strange quarks ) when the temperature approaches @xmath13 .",
    "this means that the quarks can be deconfined . here",
    ", the vacuum energy density @xmath2 is a decreasing function as temperature increases . as was pointed out by greiner et al .",
    ", the chosen values of @xmath2 affect the stability of sqm remarkably @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to consider the effect of @xmath23 .    treating the infinite sqm as a gas of noninteracting quarks and electrons @xcite , we find that the thermodynamical potential density of sqm is @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for @xmath14 ( or @xmath26 ) and the electron @xmath27(@xmath28 ) , @xmath29 for quarks and antiquarks , @xmath30 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath31 is the single particle energy and @xmath32is given by eqs.([su5]),([su6 ] ) for quarks and antiquarks .",
    "@xmath33 is the chemical potential ( for antiparticle @xmath34 ) .",
    "the number density of each particle can be obtained from eq.([su7 ] ) by means of @xmath35 and we find @xmath36 + 1}-\\frac 1{% \\exp [ \\beta ( \\varepsilon _ i+\\mu _ i)]+1}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{su9}\\ ] ] for sqm , the baryon number density satisfies @xmath37 the electric charge density @xmath38 of sqm reads @xmath39 and the light quarks are converted to strange quarks through the weak processes",
    "@xcite @xmath40 neglecting the contribution of neutrinos @xcite , we obtain the conditions of chemical equilibrium from the reactions ( [ su12 ] ) as @xmath41    noting that the chemical potentials of particles and anti - particles are determined by fermi distribution eq.([su9 ] ) , we see that eqs.([su5 ] ) , ( [ su6 ] ) , ( [ su9 ] ) , ( [ su10 ] ) , ( [ su11 ] ) , ( [ su13 ] ) and ( [ su14 ] ) form an equation group and can be solved self - consistently .",
    "the solution of this equation group determines the chemical stability of sqm .",
    "the results of numerical calculation will show in the next section . here",
    "we want to point out that at a fixed temperature @xmath20 and for a fixed value of charge density @xmath38 this equation group which determines the configuration of sqm has no solution under a critical baryon number density @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the sqm is unstable when @xmath42 . with the values of @xmath38 changed and the temperatures limited between @xmath16 , the condition @xmath43 determines a stable area which might be useful for the detectability of sqm in experiments of high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the numerical calculations of the equation group mentioned above have been done with the parameters set :    @xmath44    firstly , we study a sqm system with neutrality charge @xmath45 , for a given @xmath46 , the fractions of different quarks are given by @xmath47 at a fixed temperature @xmath48 , the @xmath14 quarks fraction are drawn in fig.1 by solid line , dashed line and dotted line , respectively . at high baryon number density ,",
    "all of the @xmath14 quarks tend to become a triplicate .",
    "when the density becomes lower , @xmath49 fraction increases and @xmath6 fraction decreases monotonously .",
    "we see from this figure that the fractions of @xmath14 quarks satisfy an inequality : @xmath50 in particular , we would like to emphasize that , as shown in fig.1 , three different quark fraction curves stop at a critical baryon number density ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "one can not find real roots for @xmath52 and @xmath53 provided @xmath42 . at @xmath0 , @xmath54 . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors defined the critical density by the condition @xmath55 .",
    "of course , the sqm  can not maintain the chemical equilibrium if no strange quarks exist .",
    "but as shown in fig.1 , this is only a sufficient but is not the necessary condition . because , one can not find solution in the ranges @xmath56 .    to compare the qmdd model",
    "in which @xmath2 is a constant and our qmdtd model in which @xmath2 satisfies eqs.([su3 ] ) and ( [ su4 ] ) , we plot the critical density @xmath0 vs temperature @xmath20 with neutral charge density @xmath45 in figure 2 , where the dashed line and the solid line refer to qmdd  model and qmdtd  model , respectively .",
    "we see that the curve given by qmdd  model can never be zero even the temperature increases to @xmath57 .",
    "it can easily be understood if we notice that @xmath58 approaches to infinity when @xmath59 from eqs.([su1 ] ) and ( [ su2 ] ) . to excite a particle with infinite",
    "mass must spend infinite energy and then infinite temperature . because of @xmath60 , when @xmath42 , the system would still be unstable even at very high temperature for qmdd  model .",
    "but for qmdtdmodel , we see from the solid line that @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "it means that the sqm is completely stable and may be detected from high energy heavy ion collision .",
    "now we are in a position to address the charge dependence of stability for sqm .",
    "the critical density vs temperature curves with various charges are shown in figure 3 , where the solid line , dotted line and dashed line refer to @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "we see that the critical density @xmath0 decreases rapidly and the stable area expands widely when @xmath38 decreases to more negative .",
    "so the negative charge is in favor of the stability of sqm .",
    "our result supports the conclusion given by greiner et al .",
    "@xcite and extends their result to finite temperature .    to study the effect of the strangeness fraction",
    ", we show the same curves as that of fig.1 but for @xmath64 in figure 4 . comparing fig.1 with fig.4 , we find that all of three curves tend to become a triplicate for @xmath64 at high density , too . and there are two major differences between these two figures , firstly , the critical density decreases from @xmath65 to @xmath66 when charge density @xmath38 changes from neutrality to negativity @xmath67 ; secondly , eq.([su16 ] ) becomes    @xmath68    the fraction of @xmath6 quarks is higher than the fraction of @xmath49 quarks .",
    "this is of course reasonable because @xmath6 quark has negative charge and @xmath49 quark positive .",
    "the critical density @xmath0 decreases as the @xmath53 increases .",
    "the higher strangeness fraction is in favor of the stability of sqm . to illustrate this result more transparently , using the expression of strangeness fraction @xmath69 which is usually employed by many references , we draw the critical strangeness fraction @xmath70 vs temperature @xmath20 curves in figure 5 , where the solid line and dashed line refer to @xmath45 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath70 is strangeness fraction corresponding to the critical density @xmath0 at the same conditions of charge and temperature .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "5 the critical strangeness fraction increases with increasing temperature .",
    "the stable area corresponds to the larger negative charge and higher strangeness fraction .",
    "finally , we hope to investigate the stability of sqm from another view point . instead of considering the chemical equilibrium",
    ", we study the behavior of chemical potentials for electron and @xmath49 quark , respectively .",
    "the reason for this choice is that the electron ( @xmath49 quark ) is the particle with minimum mass but negative ( positive ) charge in our model .",
    "the smaller the particle mass is , the lower the chemical potential will be .",
    "when chemical potential tends to be negative , the system becomes unstable because the fermi surface is negative in this case .",
    "therefore , we can use the conditions @xmath71 , @xmath72 to determine the stability of sqm .",
    "the chemical potential of electron @xmath73 vs baryon number density @xmath8 at a fixed temperature @xmath48 with various positive charge density @xmath74 and @xmath75 are drawn in figure 6 .",
    "we see that @xmath76 becomes negative and the system becomes unstable when @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , the chemical potential of @xmath49 quark @xmath78 vs baryon number density @xmath8 at a fixed temperature @xmath48 with various negative charge density @xmath79 @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xmath82 are drawn in figure 7 .",
    "we see from this figure that when @xmath83 @xmath84 , the curve will pass through a negative area and thus sqm  is unstable .",
    "therefore , at temperature @xmath48 , the charge density must be limited to @xmath85 for stable sqm .",
    "in summary , by means of the qmdtd  model , we find that the negative charge and the higher strangeness fraction are in favor of the stability of sqm at finite temperature .",
    "this result is in agreement with that given by greiner et al.@xcite at zero temperature , but we extend their conclusion to finite temperature .",
    "a critical baryon number density @xmath0 under which the sqm is unstable has been obtained .",
    "we find that @xmath0 decreases rapidly when charge density @xmath38 becomes more negative and approaches to zero at the deconfinement temperature @xmath13 . by using the chemical potentials of electron and @xmath49 quark , we suggest a method to determine the limit of charge density for the stability of sqm .",
    "we hope the stable areas given by our model can have impact on the detectability of sqm  in future heavy ion experiments .",
