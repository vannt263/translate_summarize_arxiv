    "the large @xmath6 expansion provides the powerful tool for the investigating of the fields theoretic models with a internal symmetry .",
    "being nonperturbative in its nature this method has proved to be successful in revealing properties which are inaccessible in conventional perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath3 approach relies on the expansion of the effective action in the saddle point approximation which determines the leading order structure in @xmath7 .",
    "however , beyond the lowest order the computations become quite untractable because the propagators of auxiliary fields depend on the mass in a very complicated fashion .    to obviate these difficulties",
    "it had been suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the nonlinear sigma model had been analyzed , to consider theory directly at critical point , that should ensure the masslessness of all propagators .",
    "the latter circumstance simplifies considerably the computation of the feynman diagrams . solving the skeleton dyson equation the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite have calculated the basic indices of sigma model with @xmath0 accuracy in the arbitrary space dimensions . whilst the initial application of self consistency method was to a bosonic model , the techniques",
    "have also been extended to examine the fermionic theories  @xcite .",
    "the further progress in the calculation of the critical indices is related to the conformal bootstrap method . in the frame of this approach",
    "the most strong at the present moment results     @xmath8 anomalous dimensions of the basic fields in the @xmath9 model  @xcite and in the gross  -neveu model  @xcite    had been obtained .    if one is interested in the calculation of the critical indices related to the basic fields only , these methods    self  -  consistency equations and the conformal bootstrap method    are likely to be the most efficient . however ,",
    "some specific features of the above methods make them inconvenient for the treatment of the composite operators , except for the simplest ones  @xcite . at the same time , the calculations of this type became actual now .",
    "first of all , it is related with the attempts to understand in more details the structure of the conformal fields theories ( cft ) in @xmath10 dimensions  ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the basic examples of higher dimensional cft being bosonic and fermionic @xmath11 vector models , the @xmath3 expansion underlies the computational method used for analyzing of these models .",
    "second , the renewing of the interest to the @xmath3 calculations is conditioned by the recent progress in the higher order computations of the renormalization group ( * rg * ) functions in qcd . the analytical calculations in qcd in the high orders ( four loop @xmath12  -  function  @xcite , anomalous dimensions of twist  -  2 operators  @xcite ) are very complex ones because of the huge number of feynman diagrams to be evaluated .",
    "thus it is important to have methods which may ensure the independent checks of this results .",
    "the one of the possible approach of this type is the @xmath13 expansion  @xcite .",
    "further , the necessity of the careful analysis of the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators of special type have arisen in connection with the so  -  called stability problem  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was realized that the @xmath3 expansion is the more suitable approach for this purpose  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the calculations in @xmath3 scheme beyond the @xmath3 order become tractable only when theory is considered directly at the critical point .",
    "but in this case the corresponding model lost the property of the multiplicative renormalizability and can not be worked out with the help of the standard * rg *  methods .",
    "it forces one to use other approaches applicable in this case .",
    "the methods of self  -  consistency equations and conformal bootstrap , discussed above , are applicable for the operators of the special type only .",
    "the approach based on the operator product expansion used in refs  @xcite is too involved to have a practical use in higher order calculations and limited by the models possessing of the conformal symmetry .",
    "the most convenient approach for the calculating of the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators in the first order of @xmath3 expansion had been developed in ref  @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have exploited the property of the scale invariance of the correlators at critical point to obtain the anomalous dimensions of arbitrary composite operators .",
    "the main result of the paper  @xcite is the formula expressing @xmath3 order anomalous dimensions via the @xmath14 pole residues of the corresponding diagrams  ( @xmath14 is the regularization parameter , analogous @xmath15 in dimensional regularization ) .",
    "certainly , this way is the most effective in the case of the operators of arbitrary type .    at the straightforward generalization beyond the @xmath3 order ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) the above method lost many its attractive features . in the present paper",
    "we shall take advantage of the other approach  @xcite which allow to derive the simple formula for the anomalous dimensions in the @xmath0 order . to avoid the inconveniences connected with the absence of the multiplicative renormalizability we consider extended model which",
    "is reduced to the initial one by tuning of some parameters .",
    "the extended model can be analyzed by the standard renormalization group ( * rg * ) methods . to obtain the anomalous dimensions in the initial model",
    "we relate it with the corresponding * rg *  -  functions of the extended one . in the following",
    "we restrict ourselves to the nonlinear sigma model , the generalization on the other model being straightforward .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the basic features of the nonlinear sigma model and discuss the problem to be solved . in section 3 the basic formulae for the anomalous dimensions of composite operators are derived .",
    "some technical tricks useful in higher order calculations are collected in section 4 .",

    "indeed , the renormalized action  ( [ actionr ] ) can not been brought into the form of that  ( [ action ] ) by a redefinition of the fields ( there is not a parameter like the coupling constant in  ( [ action ] ) ) . due to nonmultiplicativity",
    ", one fails to apply * rg *  methods for the calculation of critical exponents and has to seek for another approaches .",
    "one of them , which is briefly sketched below relies on the property of the scale invariance of the theory .",

    "indeed , the evaluating of the @xmath52 with @xmath0  accuracy requires the knowledge of the @xmath3 order corrections to the constant @xmath68 , which are determined by the finite parts of the @xmath3 order diagrams .",
