    "the computation of interaction forces between close surfaces has been the subject of interest in many areas of physics , like colloidal and macromolecular phenomena , nuclear physics , electrostatics , van der waals and casimir interactions .    for the case of two surfaces which are ` smooth ' , namely , that have curvature radii much larger than the typical distance between them",
    ", there is a time - honored analytical tool to compute the total interaction force , the so - called proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite .",
    "this tool has , as its main virtue , that of delivering an answer in a rather straightforward fashion , usually in the form of an ordinary integral . besides , it only demands two ingredients , the first being the knowledge of the force that would result in the same system if the two surfaces were infinite parallel plates ( the simplest possible geometry ) .",
    "the second ingredient is the actual geometry of the two surfaces , i.e. , part of the definition of the problem itself .",
    "as it may be inferred from the previous remarks , the pfa satisfies a kind of ` universality ' , since the approach is essentially geometric .",
    "in fact , the underlying microscopic mechanism responsible for the force is only required at the stage of determining the force between parallel plates , the rest being dictated solely by the geometry of the surfaces .",
    "in other words , the pfa can not distinguish ( except for a global factor ) between interactions which give place to the same force law between parallel plates .",
    "although it was originally presumed that the pfa should work reasonably well for close and gently curved surfaces , it has generally been assumed to be an uncontrolled approximation .",
    "therefrom stemmed its major drawback : the absence of a procedure to asses its accuracy , since , for instance , a procedure to evaluate next to leading order ( ntlo ) corrections was lacking . in an attempt to deal with that limitation , in the last years we proposed , tested , and applied a new approximation scheme , the so - called derivative expansion ( de ) . although originally introduced within the scope of the casimir effect , for the calculation of the interaction energy between two smooth surfaces  @xcite , this approximation has been shown to be a natural extension of the pfa , and it has proven to be useful in rather different situations , not just for casimir effect calculations @xcite .",
    "the de provides a systematic way of justifying the pfa and , under some circumstances , also of evaluating the ntlo corrections .",
    "one of the features that make the de appealing is that the corrections are also geometric in nature , as in the pfa , and the result for the interaction can also be expressed as an integral . on the other hand the main difference is , naturally enough , that knowledge of the interaction for the case of parallel plates is not sufficient to determine the ntlo .",
    "although the de approach may , and in fact has , been extended along many different directions @xcite , we shall consider here a generalization that may appear , at first sight , to be unnatural , since it corresponds to rough ( in opposition to smooth ) surfaces .",
    "however , we have in mind applying the de to the smooth surfaces on top of which a rough component exists .",
    "the influence of roughness on the interaction between surfaces has been studied in different contexts , mostly for cases where it has the form of a ripple on top of otherwise plane surfaces .",
    "this is a problem which arises , for example , in the electrostatic interaction framework , when calculating the capacitance of two ( quasi ) flat electrodes , to show that it increases in the presence of roughness  @xcite .",
    "there is also an observable influence of roughness @xcite and periodic corrugations @xcite in casimir forces . in situations where the amplitude of roughness is much smaller than the distance between surfaces",
    ", the effect of roughness can be dealt with perturbatively @xcite , taking as zero order the interaction resulting for the smooth flat surfaces ( defined to be the spatial averages of the rough ones ) .",
    "there have been some attempts to analyze the concomitant effect of shape and roughness corrections on the interaction between surfaces .",
    "for instance , the particular case in which the asperities of the surface contains occasional high peaks and deep troughs , in addition to small - scale roughness , has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . the theoretical approach consisted in a perturbative evaluation of the small scale roughness combined with pfa for the large scale peaks and troughs .",
    "a related situation has been considered in ref .",
    "the system considered there consists in surfaces whose local separation is the sum of a slowly varying component due to overall shape , and a rapid part due to modulation .",
    "the calculations were performed using the pfa , and the approximations performed are tantamount to consider a two - step pfa , in which the effect of the rapid modulation is first considered for parallel plates , and the resulting interaction per unit area is used in a second step to take into account the slow changes in the overall shape .",
    "a similar geometry was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , both from the theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "the effect of the modulation was computed using the de , and then the slowly varying shape using pfa .",
    "interestingly enough , the experimental results confirm the ntlo corrections computed using the de .    the aim of this paper is to compute the shape and roughness corrections systematically , looking for the existence of combined effects between them , beyond the pfa .",
    "specifically , we will consider systems in which the geometry can be specified by defining just two surfaces : one of them , to be denoted by @xmath0 , is assumed to be a plane , which ( by a proper choice of orthogonal cartesian coordinates ) , corresponds to the equation @xmath1 ( we use @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 to denote such a choice ) .",
    "in terms of the same set of coordinates the other surface , @xmath5 , can be defined as follows : @xmath6 an important difference between this and previously considered applications of the de , is that the function @xmath7 will not be regarded as necessarily smooth ; rather , we characterize it by the property that it can be decomposed as the sum of two terms : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a smooth function , while @xmath10 takes into account the ` rough ' component of the surface .",
    "we can not apply the de to non - smooth surfaces , but we will first average the interaction energy over the corrugation @xmath11 , and afterwards take into account the nontrivial geometry , characterized by the smooth function @xmath12 , this time by a legitimate use of the de . going beyond the leading order ( pfa ) , we will be able to asses the relative weight of the roughness and shape corrections , including in the theoretical description the combined effect of both .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : de ] we derive general expressions for the leading and ntlo terms , for the de of the functional representing the interaction energy between the two surfaces , up to the first non - trivial order in the correlation function @xmath13 .",
    "section  [ sec : general ] contains a discussion of some general properties of the novel de that contains the effect of roughness .",
    "then in section  [ sec : electro ] , we apply our general results to the case of the electrostatic interaction between two metallic surfaces at fixed electrostatic potentials .",
    "section  [ sec : casimir ] deals with the de for the interaction energy in the case of the dirichlet and neumann casimir effects . finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the corrugation function @xmath10 , introduced in eq.([eq : psi ] ) , will be regarded as a random variable with null average : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes statistical average .",
    "condition ( [ eq : zeroav ] ) can always be achieved , by a constant shift in @xmath16 . for @xmath17",
    "spatial arguments : @xmath18 , statistical averages are defined by the functional integral : @xmath19}}{\\int { \\mathcal d}\\xi \\ , e^{- w[\\xi ] } } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 $ ] denotes a ( real ) not necessarily quadratic , functional of the corrugation function @xmath10 , determining the statistical weight of the different configurations .",
    "since we assume roughness to be small , to the first non trivial order in its amplitude , we shall only need the two - point autocorrelation function @xmath13 : @xmath21 since autocorrelation functions involving more than two @xmath22 s are of higher order in the amplitude .",
    "note that , because of eq.([eq : zeroav ] ) , @xmath23 is a connected function of its arguments . in the quadratic @xmath20 $ ] case , @xmath24\\;=\\ ; \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{{\\mathbf x_\\shortparallel},{\\mathbf y_\\shortparallel } } \\xi({\\mathbf x_\\shortparallel } ) m({\\mathbf x_\\shortparallel},{\\mathbf y_\\shortparallel } ) \\xi({\\mathbf y_\\shortparallel})\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a positive - definite kernel . in this case , one has @xmath26    at this point , we introduce an extra requirement , involving both @xmath13 and @xmath16 , the smooth component of @xmath27 : the autocorrelation length @xmath28 , determined by @xmath13 , must be much smaller than the curvature radius of the smooth surface defined by @xmath16 .",
    "then , whenever the autocorrelation function differs appreciably from zero , the smooth surface can be regarded as approximately flat . in geometrical terms , the relevant pairs of arguments of @xmath13 lie on the same tangent plane to each point of the @xmath5 surface .",
    "hence , we only need to know the function @xmath13 , as an ingredient in the forthcoming calculations , for both arguments lying on the same plane surface , where it is translation - invariant ( we assume the surfaces @xmath5 and @xmath0 to be homogeneous ) .",
    "thus , we approximate @xmath29 as follows : @xmath30 where the last equality follows from the ( assumed ) local isotropy of the curved surface .    the interaction between the two surfaces is a functional , @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "however , we are not interested in the detailed dependence on @xmath27 , since that function contains the random , rapidly varying component , @xmath22 .",

    "an important exception is the gaussian ( quadratic ) weight case , where only even numbers of fields yield non - vanishing contributions .    in eq.([eq :",

    "that small amplitude assumption justifies the inclusion of just the first order in @xmath13 or , equivalently , the leading nontrivial order in the corrugation amplitude .",

    "we have found general expressions for the de of the interaction energy between two surfaces , including the first nontrivial correction due to corrugation , assumed to exist on top of an otherwise smooth surface facing a plane .",
    "the procedure we have followed to compute the interaction energy between surfaces is conceptually very simple . due to the roughness",
    ", the functional that describes the interaction energy between surfaces does not admit an expansion in derivatives .",
    "however , after averaging over the small scale fluctuations , the resulting functional only depends on the shape of the smooth surfaces ( the spatial averages of the rough ones ) , and therefore it makes sense to compute it using a de .",
    "the leading order correction @xmath219 can be thought as the usual pfa applied to the effective interaction that takes into account the roughness on parallel plates , while the next to leading term improves that by adding corrections depending on the derivatives of the function which defines the curved surface .",
    "note that , although the roughness is assumed to be described as a random variable , its statistical properties become inextricably mixed with the geometry of the surface , even at the first non - trivial order in the amplitude . at this order ,",
    "the two - point correlation function is all the information that one needs to know .",
    "it should be clear that the general results could be applied the other way around , namely , one could attempt to determine the characteristics of the roughness of a surface by performing force measurements .",
    "we have applied the general results to the case of the interaction between a rough sphere and a plane , both for electrostatic and casimir interactions .",
    "we have considered the particular case in which roughness can be described by a simple correlation function which is constant between the bandwidth set up by two momentum space cutoffs .",
    "of course the results can be extended to more realistic correlation functions , including roughness described by self - affine fractal scaling .",
    "the results of this paper could also be generalized in other directions , like for instance to the case of two curved surfaces having roughness and finite conductivity .",
