    "transport across multilayered heterostructures is a problem of great interest both for its intrinsic physics as well as its device applications @xcite .",
    "very often each of the component materials has been studied extensively on its own , but it is difficult to make use of this knowledge because various studies employ different models and it is difficult to combine their results . as a result , the only viable approach is to start anew for each heterostructure . the objective of this paper is to present a scheme for extracting suitable single - band tight - binding ( sbtb ) parameters for each of the component materials , thus translating the results of earlier studies all into one common sbtb platform which can then be used in a standard non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) based model for quantum transport .",
    "we illustrate our approach with an example of great current interest , namely an fe - mgo - fe magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) device .",
    "we use the principles described in this paper to obtain the sbtb parameters for bcc fe(100 ) from the extended hckel parameters @xcite and those for mgo from _ ab initio _ models @xcite . using these sbtb parameters , extracted from different sources , in an negf model for transport",
    "we obtain i - v characteristics , voltage dependence of tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) ratios and barrier width dependence of tmr in good agreement with published first - principles results for the same structure .",
    "_ ab initio _ modeling of materials is at an advanced stage @xcite .",
    "coupled with the quantum transport , these models have been successfully applied to nanoscale systems and heterostructures . however ,",
    "such methods are resource intensive , and simplified models that capture the essential physics due to the underlying electronic structure effects are desirable . since the seminal work of studying material properties using tight binding parameters by slater and koster @xcite , there has been a motivation to develop computationally efficient yet accurate models to capture the underlying physical mechanisms and the bandstructure effects .",
    "such simple methods may or may not capture all the intricate details present in the more sophisticated models , _",
    "e.g. _ _ ab initio _ , semi - empirical tight - binding @xcite and empirical tight - binding methods ,",
    "but they do provide a platform for large scale calculations .",
    "the simplest method currently available in this context is an effective mass model .",
    "although very successful for matching experiments , it is well known that it does not capture the electronic structure effects .",
    "we find the same for bcc fe(100 ) because the band dispersions do not remain parabolic over the two dimensional ( 2d ) transverse brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "furthermore , the energy bands have finite width , whereas bandwidth is infinite in continuum effective mass models and it depends on the lattice spacing in discrete effective mass models .",
    "moreover , the various band edges shift over the 2d bz and this shift is not necessarily dictated by the transverse mode energy @xmath2 , as prescribed by an effective mass model .",
    "our objective in this paper is to propose a computationally efficient method for heterostructures with an effort to incorporate the physics of electronic structure effects over the 2d transverse bz in the transport quantities .",
    "motivated by this , we propose a single - band tight - binding ( sbtb ) model for transport through heterostructures and outline the procedure for extracting suitable tight - binding parameters .",
    "the computational complexity of this model is the same as that of an effective mass model .",
    "recently , fe - mgo - fe heterostructures have appeared as the most noteworthy example in spintronics @xcite .",
    "these devices have emerged as one of the candidates for random access memory applications .",
    "the prediction of high tunnel magneto resistance ( tmr ) ratio for crystalline mgo barrier of over 1000@xmath3 @xcite was followed by observations of about 200@xmath3 tmr ratios at room temperature in fe - mgo - fe and cofe - mgo - cofe mtj devices @xcite .",
    "since then , there has been an increased effort to integrate them into practical devices .",
    "although , _ ab initio _ @xcite and empirical tight binding @xcite studies have been reported , their computational complexity limit their use for rapid device prototyping .",
    "this method not only allows simulating device characteristics efficiently but it also gives an inherently simple and intuitive understanding for the underlying device physics . a comparison between the sbtb and ab initio models is shown in fig .",
    "1 . for low bias ,",
    "it matches well with ref . @xcite . at high bias ,",
    "our model predicts tmr roll - off and ultimately becoming negative , which was later observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .        .",
    "@xmath4 resolved transmission for the majority and the minority spin .",
    "the bz is shown by the dotted line .",
    "the transmission has units of @xmath5 and @xmath6 has units of @xmath7.,title=\"fig:\",width=249 ] .",
    "@xmath4 resolved transmission for the majority and the minority spin .",
    "the bz is shown by the dotted line .",
    "the transmission has units of @xmath5 and @xmath6 has units of @xmath7.,title=\"fig:\",width=249 ]    our approach is to present sbtb parameters for different materials independently and then couple them across the interface . instead of fitting the parabolic bands to the bandstructure to extract effective masses , we propose to match the energy resolved transmission .",
    "the energy resolved transmission plots reflect the band structure effects for the majority and the minority spin bands over the transverse bz and we propose to capture this effect in an average manner with the sbtb parameters . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the transmission is strongly dependent on the transverse bz , and it is imperative to incorporate these effects .",
    "thus , we first extract the sbtb parameters for bcc fe(100 ) from the energy resolved transmission plots calculated using a semi - empirical atomistic method based on extended hckel theory ( eht ) .",
    "next , we propose the barrier parameters , for tunneling through the mgo region for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands by comparing with the i - v characteristics through fe - mgo - fe calculated using _ ab initio _",
    "methods @xcite . only @xmath0 and @xmath1",

    "iii , we discuss the results . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we provide the conclusions .",

    "orbital symmetry states of bands are also given @xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the real space hamiltonian @xmath18 and the overlap @xmath19 matrices",
    "are transformed into fourier ( @xmath20 ) space as : @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the integer n represents the center unit cell and m represents the neighboring unit cells .",
    "the band structure for the majority spin channel is shown in fig . 2 for various transverse wave vectors .",
    "next , the equilibrium transmission is calculated for a ten layer device ( five unit cells ) with an infinite cross - section . for calculating the transmission",
    ", we use the equilibrium scheme of negf formalism @xcite . this calculation",
    "was also checked by a more simple numerical calculation by counting the independent propagating modes at a particular energy for bcc fe .",
    "the infinite device cross - section area allows to transform the real space hamiltonian and overlap matrices in the transverse direction to reciprocal space .",
    "thus , for each transverse reciprocal @xmath24 , we have a one dimensional ( 1d ) lattice . finally , the energy resolved transmission per unit area is obtained by summation over @xmath25 as : @xmath26 and is shown in fig . 4 for the majority and the minority spin channels , using @xmath27 @xmath28 points .    100 h. zabel and s. d bader , _ magnetic heterostructures : advances and perspectives in spinstructures and spintransport _",
