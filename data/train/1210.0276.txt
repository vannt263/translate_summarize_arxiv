    "in bilayer graphene , the landau level structure in the vicinity of the contact point is drastically changed by the trigonal warping . in the presence of the trigonal warping ,",
    "the four dirac cones appear in low energies out of the parabolic bands touching at k and k points @xcite . due to this modification , we have four - fold zero - energy landau levels per spin and per valley in weak magnetic fields .",
    "so the trigonal warping doubles the degeneracy of the zero - energy landau levels from the situation in the absence of the trigonal warping .",
    "now an interesting question is how the four landau levels react to disorder .",
    "bilayer graphene , in the absence of the trigonal warping , has two - fold degenerated zero - energy landau levels , and the stability of such zero - modes against disorder in gauge degrees of freedom ( ripples ) has been shown to be a consequence of the index theorem @xcite .",
    "we have also demonstrated with an explicit numerical approach based on a tight - binding model as well as with aharonov - casher argument that the doubly - degenerated zero - energy landau levels ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) exhibit an anomalous sharpness for a bond disorder spatially correlated over more than several lattice constants and respecting the chiral symmetry of the system @xcite .",
    "so the question now is whether the additional two zero - energy landau levels in the presence of the trigonal warping in a weak magnetic field are all robust against the bond disorder as well .",
    "it is to be noted that the chiral symmetry itself is respected by the trigonal warping .    to clarify the stability of these zero - energy landau levels in the presence of the trigonal warping , we have performed numerical calculations with a tight - binding lattice model in weak magnetic fields to examine the robustness against the spatially - correlated bond disorder .",
    "we shall find that , among the four landau levels per spin and per valley , two levels exhibit the anomalous sharpness against the finite - ranged bond disorder as in the absence of the trigonal warping , while the other two are broadened .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the _ total chirality of the four dirac cones _ at k(k ) is @xmath3 , and that , remarkably enough , these are topologically protected even in the presence of the intra - valley scattering arising from the disorder .",
    "we adopt a tight - binding lattice model for bilayer graphene with the bernal ( a - b ) stacking having the inter - layer couplings @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( fig.[fig1](a ) ) .",
    "the coupling @xmath4 connecting the a@xmath6 site in the top layer and the b@xmath7 in the bottom determines the overall parabolic dispersion , while the coupling @xmath5 between the b@xmath6 and the a@xmath7 introduces the trigonal warping of the fermi surface and produces the four dirac cones at k(k ) point in a low - energy scale @xcite .",
    "we introduce the bond disorder @xmath8 in the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath9 in each layer as in ref.@xcite .",
    "the disorder is assumed to have a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath10 and have a spatial correlation as @xmath11 with the correlation length @xmath12 . in order to access to the low - energy regime in weak magnetic fields ,",
    "we consider a system as large as @xmath13 sites which is 4 times larger than those in our previous studies @xcite to evaluate the density of states from the green function @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the graphene sheet is taken into account by the peierls phases for the hopping amplitude , where the magnetic flux per hexagon of the honeycomb lattice is denoted by @xmath15 in units of the flux quantum @xmath16 .",
    "spin degrees of freedom are neglected for simplicity , and all the lengths are measured in units of the nearest - neighbor distance , @xmath17 , of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "in order to study numerically the low - energy physics where the trigonal warping ( coming from @xmath5 ) is relevant , we assume @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the above lattice model . although the present value of @xmath5 is much larger than the value estimated for the bulk graphite @xmath20 @xcite , the dispersion at low energies is still described by the four dirac cones as shown in fig.[fig1](b ) , which should be adiabatically connected to the realistic situation with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is expected therefore that the stability of the zero - mode landau levels against the disorder scattering , which mixes the four dirac cones , can be discussed within the present lattice model by assuming an appropriate ( see below ) value of the correlation length @xmath12 of the bond disorder .",
    "first , we show in fig.[fig1](c ) the density of states for @xmath23 in the absence of disorder ( @xmath24 ) , in which we clearly see that the zero - energy landau level is 4-fold degenerated per valley . it is to be noted that the zero - energy landau levels in a tight - binding lattice model with a finite system - size have small but finite widths .",
    "exact zero - energy states with the @xmath25-function density of states are realized only in the thermodynamic and continuum limit . in the present calculation ,",
    "such a small width , however , is much smaller than the energy resolution determined by the imaginary part @xmath26 of the energy , since the sharp peak in the absence of disorder can be fitted fairly accurately by the lorentzian form @xmath27 with a pre - factor consistent with the four - fold degeneracy of the landau levels .",
    "we then introduce the disorder in fig.[fig2 ] . for the case where the bond disorder is uncorrelated in space ( @xmath28 ) , we confirm that the usual broadening occurs for the zero - energy landau levels ( fig.[fig2](a ) ) . in contrast ,",
    "when the disorder is correlated over a few lattice constants ( @xmath29 ) , we have one central sharp landau levels accompanied by two broadened ones ( fig.[fig2](b),(c),(d ) ) .",
    "the peak height of the central peak is one - half of that in the absence of disorder ( fig.[fig1](c ) ) , and its shape is insensitive to the disorder strength @xmath10 .",
    "the splitting of the broadened satellite peaks becomes larger for stronger disorder .",
    "the satellite peaks indicate the splitting of the critical energy for the quantum hall transition , which has been discussed for the monolayer graphene with a short - ranged bond disorder @xcite .",
    "all these results suggest that among four - fold zero energy landau levels , two landau levels remain anomalously sharp against the spatially correlated bond disorder as in the absence of the trigonal warping ( @xmath30 ) , while the other two are broadened and split as two satellite peaks .",
    "if one notes that the separation @xmath31 between dirac cones for the present model with @xmath32 and @xmath18 is order of @xmath33 ( fig.[fig1](b ) ) , one might expect that there should be a considerable disorder scattering among these dirac cones , since the correlation length @xmath34 of disorder is smaller than @xmath35 . in actual bilayer graphene , where @xmath5 is much smaller , the separation @xmath31 is estimated to be @xmath36 @xcite , which gives @xmath37 nm for the bulk values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the scale of ripples , on the other hand , is estimated to be @xmath38 nm @xcite , which is again smaller than @xmath39 nm . we thus expect that the mixing of the four dirac cones due to ripples can be also relevant in actual bilayer graphene .",
    "we have investigated the stability of zero - mode landau levels of bilayer graphene in small magnetic fields where the trigonal warping is relevant .",
    "we have considered a bond disorder that respects the chiral symmetry and is correlated over a few lattice constants , which suppresses the inter - valley scattering but causes the intra - valley scattering .",
    "we have found that , among four - fold landau levels per spin and per valley , two landau levels are stable against such a disorder with the anomalously sharp density of states at @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "the other two levels are broadened and yield split satellite peaks .",
    "this result can be attributed to the fact that the total chirality of the four dirac cones at k ( k ) is @xmath41 , which is topologically protected even in the presence of intra - valley scattering due to disorder . when the inter - valley scattering is switched on by making the the disorder uncorrelated spatially ( @xmath42 ) ,",
    "the anomalously sharp peak is washed away ( fig . [ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "the present results then suggest that the mixing of the two dirac cones with opposite chirality by the disorder scattering generally destroys the anomalous stability of zero - mode landau levels of each dirac cone .",
