    "entanglement has , unmistakeably , played a crucial role in many quantum information processing tasks . despite the various separability criteria that have been developed , determining whether a general multipartite mixed state is entangled is far from trivial .",
    "in fact , computationally , the problem of deciding if a quantum state is separable has been proven to be np - hard  @xcite .",
    "to date , separability of a general bipartite quantum state is fully characterized only for dimension @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite . for higher dimensional quantum systems , there is no single criterion that is both necessary and sufficient for separability . nevertheless , for quantum states that are invariant under some group of local unitary operators , separability",
    "can often be determined relatively easily  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is often of interest in quantum information processing to determine if a given state can be transformed to some other desired state by local operations .",
    "indeed , convertibility between two ( entangled ) states using local quantum operations assisted by classical communication ( locc ) is closely related to the problem of quantifying the entanglement associated to each quantum system . intuitively , one expects that a ( single copy ) entangled state can be locally and deterministically transformed to a less entangled one but not the other way round .",
    "this intuition was made concrete in nielsen s work  @xcite where he showed that a single copy of a bipartite pure state @xmath5 can be locally and deterministically transformed to another bipartite state @xmath6 , if and only if @xmath6 takes equal or lower values for a set of functions known as entanglement monotones  @xcite .",
    "one can , nevertheless , relax the notion of convertibility by only requiring that the conversion succeeds with some nonzero probability .",
    "such transformations are now known as stochastic locc ( slocc )  @xcite . in this case , it was shown by vidal  @xcite that in the single copy scenario , a pure state @xmath5 can be locally transformed to @xmath6 with nonzero probability if and only if the schmidt rank of @xmath5 is higher than or equal to that of @xmath6 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the analogous situation for mixed quantum states is not as well understood even for two - qubit systems .",
    "if it were possible to obtain a singlet state by slocc from a single copy of any mixed state , it would be possible to convert any mixed state to any other state  @xcite .",
    "however , as was shown by kent _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the best that one can do  in terms of increasing the entanglement of formation  @xcite  is to obtain a bell - diagonal state with higher but generally non - maximal entanglement .",
    "in fact , apart from some rank deficient states , this conversion process is known to be invertible ( with some probability )  @xcite .",
    "hence , most two - qubit states are known to be slocc equivalent to a unique  @xcite bell - diagonal state of maximal  @xcite entanglement  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will complete the picture of two - qubit convertibility under slocc by providing the necessary and sufficient conditions for converting among bell - diagonal states .",
    "this characterization of the separable completely positive maps ( cpm ) that take bell diagonal states to bell diagonal states has other applications .",
    "specifically , it was required in the proof of our recent work  @xcite which showed that all bipartite entangled states display a certain kind of hidden non - locality  @xcite .",
    "( we show that a bipartite quantum state violates the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality  @xcite after local pre - processing with some non - chsh violating ancilla state if and only if the state is entangled . )",

    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : separablestates ] , we will start by characterizing the set of separable states commuting with @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary members of the pauli group .",
    "then , after reviewing the one - to - one correspondence between separable maps and separable quantum states in sec .  [",

    "this will then lead us to the necessary and sufficient conditions that can be used to determine if a two - qubit state can be converted to another using slocc transformations .",

    "an immediate corollary of the characterization given in sec .  [ sec : separablestates ] is that we now know exactly the set of bell - diagonal preserving transformations that can be performed locally on a bell - diagonal state . in this section",

    "with theorem  [ thm : monotones ] , it is just another small step to determine if a two - qubit state @xmath27 can be converted to another , say @xmath205 using slocc . to this end , let us first recall the following definition from ref .",

    "two states @xmath27 and @xmath205 are said to be slocc equivalent if @xmath27 can be converted to @xmath205 via slocc with nonzero probability and vice versa .",
    "next , we recall the following theorem , which can be deduced from theorem 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also theorems 13 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a two - qubit state @xmath27 is slocc equivalent to either ( 1 ) a unique bell - diagonal state satisfying eq .  , ( 2 ) a separable state , or ( 3 ) a ( normalized ) non - bell - diagonal state of the form : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is expressed in the standard product basis and @xmath211 is unique .    moreover , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the unique bell - diagonal state in case ( 1 ) is the state with maximal entanglement that can be obtained from the original two - qubit state using slocc .",
    "the two - qubit state associated with case ( 2 ) is clearly a separable one since a separable state is , and can only be , slocc equivalent to another separable state .",
    "the situation for case ( 3 ) is somewhat more complicated and the original two - qubit states associated with this case are either of rank 3 or 2 ( in the case of @xmath212 )  @xcite . by very inefficient slocc transformations ",
    "quasi - distillation  @xcite  the entanglement in the equivalent state @xmath213 can be maximized by converting it into the following bell - diagonal state : @xmath214 however , it remains unclear from existing results  @xcite if this process is reversible  @xcite . in this regard",
    ", we have found that the reverse process can indeed be carried out via a separable map with two terms involved in the kraus decomposition . in particular , a possible form of the kraus operators associated with this separable map reads [ eq .  ] : @xmath215 thus , a two - qubit state that is slocc equivalent to @xmath213 is also slocc equivalent to a unique bell - diagonal state @xmath216 . by further local unitary transformation",
    ", we can bring @xmath216 into a form that satisfies eq .  .",
    "hence , this leads us to the following theorem .",
    "all entangled two - qubit states are slocc equivalent to a unique bell - diagonal state satisfying eq .  .    with this theorem",
    ", one can now readily determine if an _",
    "entangled _ two - qubit state @xmath27 can be converted to another , say , @xmath205 , using slocc .",
    "for that matter , let @xmath184 and @xmath217 be , respectively , the unique bell - diagonal state satisfying eq .",
    "that is slocc equivalent to @xmath27 and @xmath205 .",
    "then , it follows from theorem  [ thm : monotones ] that @xmath27 can be transformed to @xmath205 using slocc if and only if the corresponding weight vectors of the associated bell - diagonal states @xmath175 and @xmath206 satisfy eqs .  - . in other words , the slocc convertibility of two two - qubit states can be decided via the following theorem .",

    "schematically , if neither @xmath27 nor @xmath205 are separable and if eqs .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the bi - separability of the set of four - qubit states commuting with @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary members of the pauli group .",
    "these are essentially convex combination of two ( not necessarily identical ) copies of bell states .",
    "evidently , these states are all separable across the two copies .",
    "for the other bi - partitioning , we have found that the separable subset is a convex polytope and hence can be described by a finite set of entanglement witnesses .",
    "equivalently , this characterization has also given us the complete set of separable , bell - diagonal preserving , completely positive maps .",
    "this has enabled us to derive a complete set of slocc monotones for bell - diagonal states , which can be used to determine if a bell - diagonal state can be converted to another using slocc .",
    "we have then supplemented the result on slocc equivalence presented in refs .",
    "@xcite to arrive at the conclusion that all entangled two - qubit states are slocc equivalent to a unique bell - diagonal state . combining this with the slocc monotones that we have derived immediately leads us to some simple necessary and sufficient criteria on the slocc convertibility between two - qubit states .",
