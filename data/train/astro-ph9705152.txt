    "this paper is the second in a series reporting redshifts for galaxies found at very low galactic latitudes , obtained for the purpose of mapping large - scale structures previously hidden by the southern milky way . the first paper ( kraan - korteweg , fairall & balkowski 1995 - hereafter paper i ) dealt with the hydra ",
    "antlia region ; it also gave full details of the nature of the survey .",
    "the present paper covers the `` crux '' region immediately neighbouring hydra  antlia ; it does not repeat information given in paper i , to which the reader is referred for an extensive description of the motivation , survey and observing procedures .    as before ,",
    "galaxies in the general galactic latitude range @xmath8 have been found by scanning film copies of the src iiiaj survey under 50 times magnification , the details of which will be presented as a catalogue ( woudt & kraan - korteweg 1997 , hereafter wkk97 ) . for the present work",
    ", some 500 square degrees of sky has been searched .",
    "it involves 21 fields limited at @xmath9 , namely f62 - 67 , f94 - 98 , f130 - 134 and f171 - 175 .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of the 3760 galaxies found in the crux region .",
    "only @xmath10% (= 87 ) of these galaxies had been catalogued before by lauberts ( 1982 ) .",
    "the entire area surveyed so far by us is indicated in figure 1 .",
    "the dashed line on the right demarcates the hydra ",
    "antlia region , the middle section ( solid line ) is the crux region whereas the dashed line on the left shows the great attractor region .",
    "= 16.5 cm    the newly found galaxies in the crux region significantly reduce the width of the `` zone of avoidance '' ( zoa ) created by the milky way .",
    "nevertheless there is a generally sharp cutoff along the northern boundary at @xmath11 and a more gradual but irregular extinction between @xmath12 and @xmath13 on the southern edge .",
    "the forthcoming blind hi - survey with the multi - beam system at parkes should unveil the remaining parts of the extragalactic sky between these boundaries .",
    "the distribution of optically detected galaxies inside the crux region is far from smooth .",
    "north of the milky way , there are three apparent concentrations at galactic longitudes @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the latter two suggest a continuation of the centaurus wall into the zoa . south of the milky way , there is a concentration ( at @xmath16 ) which is most likely a distant overdensity as the survey reveals a corresponding excess of smaller fainter galaxies .",
    "the crux region does include part of the `` great attractor '' ( ga ) ( lynden - bell et al .",
    "however , the main component of the ga lies within the boundaries of our neighbouring search area ( @xmath17 ) including the centre of the ga which kolatt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) predict at @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "that region will be covered in a third paper in this series ; it is dominated by aco 3627  hereafter named the norma cluster ",
    "already recognised as a nearby massive cluster ( kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "1996 - hereafter kk96 ) while work on this survey was in progress .",
    "as before , spectroscopic observations of the more widespread brighter ( b@xmath2 ) galaxies , identified in our survey , have been carried out with the 1.9 m radcliffe reflector and unit spectrograph at the south african astronomical observatory during four weeks in 1993  1995 , and are reported in section 2 below .",
    "we have also continued to complement these observations by programmes using the mefos ( multi - fibre ) spectrograph system ( felenbok et al .",
    "1997 ) on the 3.6 m telescope at the european southern observatory ( for fainter distant galaxies ) , and using the parkes radio telescope ( to cope with nearby galaxies of low optical brightness ) . the outcome of these complementary programmes will be presented separately .",
    "the observations at saao were carried out over 3500 ",
    "7000 with a resolution of @xmath203 per pixel .",
    "integration times typically range from 500 to 2500 seconds .",

    "although the galaxies we observed were initially selected on the basis of having no published redshifts , more recent publications have provided redshifts from other investigators for 20 of the galaxies in table 1 and table 2 .",
    "this overlap , however , allows a suitable comparison between our sample and others .",
    "we find @xmath34    which shows no significant systematic error , and agrees well within our average standard deviation .",
    "similarly , we have allowed a small overlap between the saao galaxies and our complementary programmes using mefos and parkes radio observations , for which we find    @xmath35    @xmath36    the comparison with the mefos and parkes data is based on 5 and 12 galaxies respectively .",
    "again , the agreement is acceptable with our standard deviation ; the latter in any case probably reflects low surface - brightness galaxies , for which our errors are at their largest values .",
    "we have obtained reliable redshifts for 173 galaxies , with tentative redshifts for a further 36 objects , as set out in table 1 .",
    "the tentative redshifts are not used in any of the subsequent plots or analyses .",
    "8.8 cm    8.8 cm    figure 2 shows the sky coverage of the galaxies with reliable redshifts , depicted by solid circles .",
    "the coverage can be seen to be reasonably uniform , on both the north and south sides of the galactic obscuration . by contrast , the data from table 4  galaxies with previously known redshifts as depicted by the open circles  is strongly concentrated north of the plane .",
    "this is due to the redshift surveys in that area that focussed on the great attractor ( esp .",

    "figure 3 presents a comparison of the magnitudes and major - axis distribution of the observed galaxies ; it shows general similarity to the corresponding plot in paper i. the sharp magnitude cut - off indicates the limiting performance of the 1.9 m telescope for galaxies fainter than ( b@xmath2 ) .",
    "these observations trace the bright end of the magnitude distribution of the 3760 galaxies in the crux region very well .",
    "we are 70% complete for galaxies brighter than ( b@xmath37 ) and even 54% complete for galaxies brighter than ( b@xmath38 ) .",
    "these numbers are comparable to the completeness figures in the hydra  antlia region . as before ,",
    "a number of bright galaxies are missed by this survey .",
    "they are extended low surface brightness spiral galaxies . in the meantime , they have been observed with the parkes 64m telescope and will be reported on elsewhere .",
    "the histogram of redshifts shown in figure 4 reveals a broad concentration of galaxies around @xmath39 km  s@xmath6 , with a probable dip at @xmath40 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "this is quite different to the single peak centred at @xmath41 km  s@xmath6for the neighbouring hydra ",
    "antlia region to the west ( paper i ) , and the dominating peak at @xmath42 km  s@xmath6of the norma cluster ( kk96 ) to the east .",
    "it suggests that quite different large - scale structures may be present in this crux region , which we shall examine in greater detail below .",
    "8.8 cm      in regard to the interpretation of data in three - dimensional redshift space , particularly in the absence of magnitude controls , the reader is directed to the introductory discussion in section 3.2 of paper i. in interpreting these plots , note that the hydra ",
    "antlia zoa region is covered observationally as deep as the current crux region , whereas other low  latitude regions only have very sparse redshift information    figure 5 shows the surveyed region and its surrounding volume sliced in redshift intervals of @xmath43 km  s@xmath6 . as already indicated , most of the data points , within the outlined crux region , are from the new observations .",
    "conspicuous features occur in the second and third slices - matching the excess already noted in the histogram of figure 4 .    in the second slice ,",
    "the new data reinforce the presence of a narrow filamentary structure running all the way from @xmath44 , @xmath45 to the centaurus cluster at @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "this is believed to be part of a great wall - like structure seen edge - on  the centaurus wall .",
    "the new observations fill in a portion of this feature previously hidden by the milky way - as might be expected of a continuous massive structure .",
    "the break , due to the obscuration close to the galactic plane is now much narrower .",
    "the new data in the top - left corner of the crux region is concentrated in the @xmath48 km  s@xmath6range - slightly closer than most other condensations within the wall .",
    "there are also indications of weaker filaments : one crosses north - south at @xmath49 while another passes just outside the south - east corner of the surveyed area .",
    "however , the most important structure revealed by the present survey occurs in the third slice down .",
    "this is a concentration of galaxies centred at @xmath50 km  s@xmath6 in the upper ( northern ) segment of the surveyed volume .",
    "together with the neighbouring galaxies outside the survey volume , it suggests a large - scale structure running more or less horizontally across the diagram .",
    "we have earlier labelled this structure as the `` norma supercluster '' ( woudt et al .",
    "traces can also be seen in the following slice , so the feature is also probably wall - like seen roughly side on - i.e. its width ( or depth in fig 5 ) being some @xmath51 km  s@xmath6 and its thickness several hundred km  s@xmath6 unless much is still hidden by the dense obscuration .",
    "we shall see however ( in fig 6 ) that this feature is more complex . for",
    "the moment note the concentration at @xmath49 in the fourth slice - coincident with that seen earlier in figure 1 .",
    "bearing in mind its greater distance , compared to the centaurus wall mentioned above , this new structure must be similarly massive .",
    "the norma cluster is situated where these two massive structures  the centaurus wall and the norma supercluster  intersect .",
    "features at greater redshifts are understandably narrower in angular dimensions , and more difficult to discern : the fourth slice shows a feature running along the southern boundary of the crux region . beyond that , the data is generally too sparse , except for a weak concentration at @xmath52 km  s@xmath6 in the south - east ( bottom left ) , that corresponds to the relatively distant overdensity noted earlier .",
    "8.8 cm      our final set of plots , figure 6 , shows slices in galactic latitude ; the uppermost including the centaurus and hydra clusters , the lowest the pavo cluster .",
    "the product of our survey appears as the middle slice , which would otherwise be largely blank .",
    "instead , the slice reveals a cellular structure - familiar from plots elsewhere in the sky ( eg fairall et al .",
    "1990 ) - but never before discerned so clearly at so low a galactic latitude .",
    "presumably , the appearance is somewhat assisted by a favourable angle of cut .",
    "the cell sizes , and the voids so contained , are @xmath53 km  s@xmath6 in diameter .",
    "of particular interest is a radial feature ( from 5300 to 7000 km  s@xmath6 ) , almost dead centre , that corresponds to the concentration at galactic longitude @xmath49",
    ". the feature could be the `` finger of god '' of a small cluster except it is not discernable as such in a central longitude slice ( not reproduced here ) .",
    "the main finding of this survey has been an overdensity of galaxies in the @xmath54 km  s@xmath6range in redshift . rather than a single feature , this overdensity represents a set of distinct cellular structures similar to those seen at higher galactic latitudes and for which figure 6 ( middle plot ) provides a mapping .",
    "the survey also provides more detailed mapping of the `` centaurus wall '' where it crosses the milky way ."
