    "time - resolved x - ray spectroscopy studies of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) offer the opportunity to investigate emission regions near the central black hole .",
    "in fact , x - ray spectroscopy offers the clearest view of processes occurring very close to the black hole itself , probing matter to its final plunge into the black hole .",
    "armed with such information , we can unlock the structure of the innermost regions of agn .",
    "typical x - ray spectra of agn show an underlying powerlaw produced near the central black hole with signatures of reprocessed photons often present .",
    "these reprocessed photons show up as an fe k@xmath4 line at @xmath56.4 kev and a `` reflection hump '' which starts to dominate near 10 kev and is produced by the combined effects of photoelectric absorption and compton downscattering in optically - thin cold matter irradiated by the hard x - ray continuum .",
    "the fe k@xmath4 line has been observed in both type 1 ( unabsorbed ) and type 2 ( absorbed ) seyfert galaxies .",
    "it has been attributed to either the broad line region , the accretion disk , the molecular torus of unification models @xcite , or some combination of these .",
    "signatures of reflection have also been observed in both seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies .",
    "if the unification models are correct , we should see similar spectral correlations between seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies , with any differences easily attributable to our viewing angle .",
    "regardless of the accuracy of the reflection models , we expect changes in the underlying continuum to drive changes in the reprocessing features .",
    "however , results from x - ray spectral studies of agn have so far produced puzzling results .",
    "samples of seyfert 1 observations from _ asca _",
    "@xcite and _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ @xcite have shown no obvious relationship between changes in the continuum and iron line .",
    "several galaxies have shown an anticorrelation between reflection and/or iron line equivalent width and the source flux ; e.g. ngc 5548 @xcite , mcg @xmath66 - 30 - 15 @xcite , ngc 4051 @xcite , ngc 5506 @xcite .",
    "recent data from _ suzaku _  on mcg @xmath66 - 30 - 15 , on the other hand , show that the iron line and reflection remain relatively constant while the powerlaw is highly variable @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that seyfert galaxies and x - ray binaries show a correlation between the continuum slope and reflection fraction , so those with soft intrinsic spectra show stronger reflection than those with hard spectra .",
    "however , other studies have found either a shallower relationship than zdziarski et al .",
    "@xcite or an anticorrelation @xcite .    here",
    "we present the first results of a larger study of the x - ray spectral properties of seyfert galaxies observed by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "our full study consists of observations of 30 galaxies . in this letter",
    ", we focus on the spectral results from the subset of 12 seyfert 1 and 1.2 galaxies . in ",
    "[ section : analysis ] we present our method of data analysis , including our sample selection criteria (   [ subsection : sample ] ) , a description of our data pipeline (   [ subsection : pipeline ] ) , and results of our spectral analysis (   [ subsection : results ] ) .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in ",
    "[ section : discussion ] and detail our conclusions in ",
    "[ section : conclusions ] .",
    "the _ rxte _  public archive represents one of the largest collections of x - ray data for agn , with pointed observations of over 100 agn spanning 10 years .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "bandpass allows the study of absorption and iron line properties of agn spectra , as well as a glimpse at the compton reflection hump .",
    "we use data from the _ rxte_proportional counter array ( pca ) , which is sensitive to energies from 2 to 60 kev and consists of five proportional counter units ( pcus ) .",
    "most of the sources in our sample do not show significant counts in the _ rxte _  hard energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) , so we do not include hexte data in this study .    to focus this study ,",
    "we choose only seyfert galaxies for which the _ rxte _  public archive contained a minimum of two pointings separated by at least two weeks .",
    "we further required the total observed time be @xmath7 ks . these selection criteria led to a sample of 40 seyfert galaxies .",
    "for the analysis presented here , we examine the 18 seyfert 1 and 1.2 galaxies .",
    "six galaxies were eliminated after they were put through our data pipeline ( see   [ subsection : pipeline ] for more ) , so the final sample presented here consists of 12 galaxies , listed in table  [ table : sources ] .",
    "because the data come from the public archive , the sample is not uniform from galaxy to galaxy or even from observation to observation ; however , we use the standard 2 data , which provides a standard data mode for these diverse observations .      to ensure consistent data reduction of the large volume of data , we developed a data pipeline .",
    "the standard 2 data for each observation was reduced using a combination of ftools and the python@xmath8 scripting language .",
    "the pipeline produces time - resolved spectra , each with a minimum of 125,000 net photons , which are extracted using standard pca selection criteria and background models @xcite .",
    "sources which did not have sufficient net photons for even one spectrum were eliminated from the final sample ( table  [ table : sources ] shows the final sample with the 6 eliminated sources listed in the table notes ) .",
    "each spectrum includes 1% systematic errors .",
    "we are confident in the instrument response and background models up to energies of @xmath525 kev , so we ignore channels with higher energies .",
    "the data pipeline produced 350 spectra for the 12 galaxies in our sample .",
    "each spectrum was fitted from 3 to 25 kev with an absorbed compton reflection model plus a gaussian iron line . in ` xspec ` , the pexrav @xcite model simulates the effects of an exponentially cut - off powerlaw reflected by neutral matter and has seven model parameters : photon index of the intrinsic underlying power - law ( @xmath1 ) , the cutoff energy of the power law in kev ( @xmath9 ) , the relative amount of reflection ( @xmath3 ) , the redshift ( @xmath10 ) , the abundance of heavy elements in solar units ( @xmath11 ) , the disk inclination angle ( @xmath12 ) , and the photon flux of the power law at 1 kev in the observer s frame ( @xmath13 ) . the relative amount of reflection is normalized to 1 for the case of an isotropic source above a disk of neutral material ( @xmath14 ) . adding a gaussian line ( energy in kev ( @xmath15 ) , physical width ( @xmath16 ) in kev , and normalization in units of photons @xmath17 s@xmath18 ) and an absorbing column ( @xmath19 , in @xmath17 ) yields a total of 12 parameters .",
    "we fixed the following values in pexrav : @xmath9 = 500 kev , @xmath11 = 1.0 , and @xmath20 = 0.95 .",
    "this inclination represents an almost face - on disk ; however , since we are seeking trends in the spectral parameters , rather than absolute values , the precise value is not important to this study .",
    "in addition , @xmath10 is fixed at the appropriate value from the nasa extragalactic database for each galaxy .",
    "after fitting all spectra to this model , we derived the mean gaussian width for each source ( table  [ table : sources ] ) , then held @xmath16 fixed for a second fit to the model .",
    "our final model has free parameters : @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath13 , @xmath15 , iron line normalization and @xmath19 . to prevent ` xspec ` from pursuing unphysical values of the parameters , we set the following hard limits : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 kev , and @xmath24 kev ( for the free-@xmath16 fits ) .    looking at the iron line equivalent width ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath1 , we find a complex relationship with a `` hump '' peaking near @xmath25 ( figure  [ fig1]a ) .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 plot shows a correlation for @xmath26 and an anti - correlation for @xmath27 , with a peak near @xmath25 with @xmath28 ev . we also find a strong correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 ( figure  [ fig2]a ) , with a best - fit line of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we performed a monte carlo simulation to determine if our results were an artifact of modeling degeneracies .",
    "each spectrum in the monte carlo sample was simulated with @xmath19=@xmath31 @xmath17 , @xmath1=2.0 , @xmath3=1.0 , @xmath15=6.4 kev , and @xmath32=0.23 kev .",
    "the flux and exposure times were randomly varied for each spectrum .",
    "the flux was varied by randomly choosing @xmath13 from a uniform distribution between 0.004 and 0.06 photons kev@xmath33 @xmath34 s@xmath33 .",
    "the exposure time was randomly generated from a uniform distribution between 300 and 11000s .",
    "the ranges for @xmath13 and the exposure time represent the range of @xmath13 and exposure for the spectra in the full sample .",
    "we generated 200 spectra : 100 simulated using an _ rxte _",
    "epoch 3 response , 50 using an epoch 4 response , and 50 using an epoch 5 response , roughly corresponding to our _ rxte _  sample .",
    "each spectrum was then fitted to the same model as our full sample .",
    "the @xmath3 over @xmath1 plot ( figure  [ fig2]b ) clearly shows a strong correlation with a best - fit line of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , which strongly suggests that the observed @xmath3-@xmath1 correlation is a result of modeling degeneracies .",
    "the correlation shows a much steeper relationship than the seyfert 1 data , due to the large number of seyfert 1 spectra showing @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 , however , do not suffer the same degeneracies , which is clear from the monte carlo results ( figure  [ fig1]b ) .",
    "based on the lack of correlation in our monte carlo results , we are confident that the shape of the @xmath0-@xmath1 plot for the data sample is real .    to further examine the @xmath0-@xmath1 relationship , we reproduced the @xmath0-@xmath1 plot to show the contribution from each galaxy ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the radio - loud galaxies form the rising leg , with the quasar , 3c 273 , anchoring the low @xmath1-low @xmath0 portion of the plot .",
    "the seyfert 1 ( radio quiet ) and 1.2 galaxies tend to congregate at the peak and the falling leg of the plot .",
    "the one narrow - line seyfert 1 diverges from the main cluster of points .",
    "finally , we examined @xmath0 as a function of the intrinsic 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity ( @xmath38 ) , using @xmath39 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "we fitted the data for each galaxy , each type , and the sample as a whole to linear and powerlaw models .",
    "the data were well - fit for either model .",
    "for consistency with other publications , we report here the powerlaw results . for the sample as a whole",
    ", we see an anticorrelation , i.e. the x - ray baldwin effect @xcite , with @xmath40 .",
    "when examining galaxy types , however , the anticorrelation does not always hold up ( table  [ table : sources ] ) .",
    "we find an anticorrelation in the radio loud galaxies and the seyfert 1.2s , but a marginal correlation for the quasar and radio quiet seyfert 1s .",
    "the simulations of @xcite for the observed spectrum from an x - ray source illuminating a half - slab showed that the spectra should include a `` compton hump '' and an iron line .",
    "they found that the iron line ew should decrease as the spectrum softens .",
    "this is easy to understand , since as the spectrum softens ( @xmath1 increases ) , there are fewer photons with energies above the iron photoionization threshold .",
    "our results show that the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is not quite so simple .",
    "we find a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 when @xmath2 and an anticorrelation when @xmath41 .",
    "other researchers have found a correlation for seyfert 1 samples @xcite , but the galaxies in their samples primarily fell in the @xmath2 region .",
    "@xcite also find that their data suggest a slight correlation for a sample of radio loud and radio quiet type 1 agn .",
    "a close examination of our @xmath0-@xmath1 plot shows that the data for different galaxy types progresses across the plot .",
    "the plot is anchored at the low-@xmath1 , low-@xmath0 end by the quasar , 3c 273 , in our sample .",
    "the rising arm of the plot , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ev , is primarily formed by radio loud seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the radio - quiet seyfert 1 galaxies cluster near the @xmath25 , @xmath44 ev peak of the hump , and the radio - quiet seyfert 1.2 galaxies form the falling arm of the plot for @xmath45 .    physically ,",
    "the most obvious difference between these sources is the presence or absence of a strong jet .",
    "we propose that this relationship is driven by the degree of jet - dominance of the source .",
    "the iron line features are associated with the x - ray emission from the disk .",
    "since the disk is essentially isotropic , it will excite an observable iron line from matter out of our line - of - sight . on the other hand ,",
    "the jet is beamed away from the obvious configurations of matter in the system and , more importantly , is beamed toward us in the quasar and radio - loud sources .",
    "both of these jet - related phenomena reduce the observed equivalent width of any iron line emission associated with the jet continuum .    in order for the @xmath1 to increase as the jet - dominance decreases",
    ", the jet in these sources must have a hard x - ray component , which implies that the radio - loud seyferts in our sample are to be associated with low - peaked bl lac objects ( lbls ) .",
    "bl lac objects show two broad peaks in their spectral energy density plots @xcite , with the lower - energy peak due to synchrotron emission and the higher - energy peak due to inverse compton emission .",
    "bl lacs are divided into two classes , depending on where the peaks occur : high - peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) and lbls .",
    "the x - ray continuum in the hbls is rather soft , since we are seeing the synchrotron spectrum cutting off in these sources .",
    "lbls , on the other hand , tend to have a harder x - ray continua , since we are observing well into the inverse compton part of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "we also note that much of the falling arm of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relationship is formed by mcg @xmath66 - 30 - 15 .",
    "recent observations of mcg @xmath66 - 30 - 15 by suzaku have shown that the reflection component , including the iron line , remains relatively constant @xcite .",
    "we would expect , then , that as @xmath1 increases , the @xmath0 should decrease , which is exactly what we see in our data .",
    "significant degeneracies between the photon index , absorbing column , and reflection fraction can easily lead to false conclusions about spectral correlations .",
    "these degeneracies occur as these three parameters trade off against each other in the modeling process , an effect that is especially strong in the _ rxte _  bandpass .",
    "our @xmath3-@xmath1 plot shows a strong correlation which is mimicked in our monte carlo results .",
    "the few points that lie under the main concentration are likely to be outliers , and not indicative of a subclass of galaxy .",
    "these points all come from spectra that have been fitted to have @xmath46 , and are primarily radio - loud galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the observed @xmath3-@xmath1 correlation in our sample can not be trusted as a real correlation .",
    "looking at the @xmath0-@xmath38 relationship , we do see the x - ray baldwin effect for our sample as a whole , with a slighly shallower anticorrelation than reported elsewhere .",
    "we find @xmath47 , whereas @xcite and @xcite find @xmath48 and @xcite find @xmath49 .",
    "however , when @xcite exclude the radio loud galaxies from their sample , they find @xmath50 .",
    "we find , though , that when we examine our data on a galaxy - by - galaxy or type - by - type basis , the effect is not consistent from source to source . at this point",
    ", we can not determine if these variations are real or are simply due to the small number of spectra for some of our galaxies and types .",
    "we have examined time - resolved spectra of 12 seyfert 1 and 1.2 galaxies observed by _ rxte _  over seven years .",
    "we find a complex relationship between the iron line equivalent width and the continuum slope , with a correlation for @xmath2 that turns over to an anticorrelation for @xmath51 .",
    "we propose that this relationship is a possible diagnostic for jet- versus disk - dominated sources , where jet - dominated sources show a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and disk - dominated sources show an anticorrelation .",
    "we also see a strong correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath3 which is likely an artifact of modeling degeneracies caused by the interplay of @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath52 in the _ rxte _  bandpass .",
    "finally , we observe the x - ray baldwin effect for the sample as a whole , but not for each galaxy and galaxy type individually .",
    "this research has also made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
