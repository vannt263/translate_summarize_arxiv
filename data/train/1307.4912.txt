    "the ray - singer conjecture has been formulated in the seminal paper of ray and singer @xcite and proved independently by cheeger @xcite and mller @xcite for unitary representations .",
    "its importance stems from the fact that as in the atiyah - singer index theorem , it equates analytic with combinatorial quantities , the analytic ray - singer and the combinatorial reidemeister torsions .    by construction ,",
    "both the analytic ray - singer and the combinatorial reidemeister torsions provide canonical norms on the determinant line of cohomology .",
    "there have been various approaches to obtain a canonical construction of analytic and reidemeister torsions as elements instead of norms of the determinant line of the cohomology .",
    "these constructions seek to refine the notion of analytic and reidemeister torsion norms on that determinant line , which basically corresponds to fixing a complex phase in the family of complex vectors of length one .    in case of the reidemeister torsion",
    "this has been done by farber and turaev @xcite and @xcite .",
    "refinement of analytic torsion has been studied by the first author jointly with kappeler in @xcite and @xcite , as well as by burghelea and haller in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both notions have subsequently been compared by the first author jointly with kappeler in @xcite .",
    "an extension of refined analytic torsion to manifolds with boundary has been undertaken by the second author @xcite and lee and huang @xcite in two different independent constructions .",
    "recently , lee and huang also compared the two notions of refined analytic torsion on manifolds with boundary in @xcite .",
    "the fundamental property of the refined analytic and farber - turaev torsions is that they define analytic functions on the complex representation space .",
    "the main result of the present discussion is an extension of this result to the refined analytic torsion on manifolds with boundary , introduced by the second author in @xcite . as a consequence we establish the gluing property of refined analytic torsion on connected components of the representation variety that contain a unitary point .",
    "the gluing formula for refined analytic torsion may be used to prove a gluing result for the ray - singer torsion norm for certain non - unitary representations path - connected to a unitary element .",
    "however we chose to devote the final two sections of the present paper to an alternative proof of the gluing property for the ray singer analytic torsion for non - unitary representations , which is stronger since we do not single out connected components without unitary elements .",
    "the ray - singer theorem has been extended to unimodular representations by mller @xcite . in case of a general non - unitary representation ,",
    "the quotient of the analytic and reidemeister torsion norms admits additional correction terms which have been studied by bismut and zhang in @xcite . in a separate discussion @xcite ,",
    "the authors employ analyticity of refined analytic torsion to provide an alternative derivation of the bismut - zhang correction terms for the connected components of unitary points in the representation variety .    both the analytic and combinatorial reidemeister torsions make sense on compact manifolds with boundary after posing relative or absolute boundary conditions .",
    "the gluing property of the analytic torsion , which is foremost a spectral invariant , is striking and has been proved by lck @xcite , vishik @xcite and generalized by lesch @xcite , under the assumption of product metric structures and unitary representations .",
    "the anomaly of analytic torsion on a compact manifold with boundary with a non - unitary representation and general metric structures near the boundary , has been studied by brning and ma in @xcite .",
