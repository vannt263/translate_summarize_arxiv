    "for this , it suffices to use a cut - off function @xmath656 with support in a neighborhood of the origin , and for @xmath657 , @xmath658 , to define @xmath652 by the vectorial equation @xmath659 where @xmath641 and @xmath660 .",
    "since the resolution of bishop s equation is stable under perturbation , there exists a smoothly deformed family @xmath661 of analytic discs with @xmath662 and a deformed wedge @xmath663 since @xmath612 and @xmath655 have opposite directions , it is clear that one can insure that @xmath664 contains the point @xmath490 .    for @xmath665 ,",

    "assume that the source @xmath9 is a hypersurface and that @xmath50 is essentially finite at @xmath16 .",
    "proceeding by contradiction , suppose that @xmath9 is not minimal at @xmath16 .",
    "equivalently , the cr orbit of @xmath16 is an @xmath669-dimensional complex hypersurface passing through @xmath16 , which coincides in fact with the segre variety @xmath670 .",
    "choose holomorphic coordinates @xmath671 vanishing at @xmath16 in which @xmath672 and represent @xmath9 by a single complex equation @xmath673 , where @xmath674 , whence @xmath675 .",

    "hence apply the derivations @xmath684 , for @xmath685 , to  , which amounts to applying the derivations @xmath686 to  , which yields expressions of the form @xmath687 exactly as in  3 , it follows from the essential finiteness assumption that there exist weierstrass polynomials such that @xmath688 putting @xmath689 , it follows that @xmath690 is a constant for @xmath691 , hence vanishes identically .",
    "however , if @xmath692 vanishes identically , it is clearly impossible for @xmath50 to be essentially finite at @xmath16 , since differentiation with respect to @xmath693 of @xmath694 gives nothing else than the constant zero , so @xmath67 is defined by @xmath695 , hence is positive - dimensional .",

    "thus , the ideal in @xmath710 generated by the partial derivatives @xmath717 is of finite codimension .",
