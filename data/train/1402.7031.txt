    "the effective energy transfer in photosynthetic complexes has been one of the focal points of experimental and theoretical studies during recent years @xcite .",
    "the light energy is absorbed by the pigments in the antenna systems and subsequently transferred to a reaction center , where the created electron - hole pairs are separated and the energy is converted to chemical compounds .",
    "the energy conversion efficiency of this process can reach 99% @xcite .",
    "the chromophore complexes located between the antenna and the reaction center are of special interest , because of the recent observation of the long - lived quantum coherence in the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex of green sulfur bacteria @xcite and marine cryptophyte algae @xcite .",
    "the fmo complex @xcite is one of the most studied photosynthesis - related systems .",
    "it is a trimer with each unit consisting of seven bacteriochlorophyll a ( bchl - a ) molecules and with three more bchls between the units ( so - called the eighth bchls ) .",
    "this molecular system is placed between an antenna and the reaction center where the charges are separated .",
    "the light harvested in the antenna excites one of the bchls and this excitation propagates through the complex until it reaches the reaction center .",
    "this energy transfer has been addressed in numerous theoretical works @xcite employing various types of approximations .",
    "bchls are coupled to the protein environment and its role in the excitation transfer has been widely discussed . in particular , it was suggested that the interaction with the environment can assist exciton transport @xcite and , moreover , can lead to a new type of exitonic - vibrational coherence @xcite .",
    "however , it is still open question how this type of coherence affects the efficiency of the exciton transfer through the chromophore network .    in this paper , we examine the exciton propagation through the system of many inter - coupled chromophores to the reaction center in the presence of an external excitation , radiation heat bath , quenching field , and protein environment considered as a system of independent oscillators .",
    "the main focus here is to the coupling to a specific vibronic mode which can not be treated as a heat bath .",
    "the coupling strengths of all the surrounding components are very different , so various levels of approximations should be used . in particular , the contributions of the quenching and radiation fields , as well as that of the reaction center , are calculated perturbatively within the secular approximation .",
    "the reorganization energy of the protein environment is of the order of the inter - chromophore couplings , so we have to incorporate non - marcovian effects .",
    "however , in the case of slow protein motion and high enough temperatures , the dynamics under the time integral can be simplified .",
    "we do not apply this approximation for the strongly - coupled vibronic mode and also take into account the interplay of the last two processes .",
    "for all the above interactions , we take into account the contributions of both diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "the couplings of the system to the external light source and to a reaction center are explicitly included in our hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , we are able to calculate the rate of energy transfer to the reaction center and the rate of the energy absorbtion by the system and , correspondingly , to _ directly _ determine the efficiency of the energy transfer .",
    "previously , @xcite , the efficiency was calculated indirectly by the population of the last chromophore in the chain .",
    "it should be also emphasized that our approach is not restricted to the single - exciton - propagation case , and the chromophore network can contain as many excitons as the number of chromophores .",
    "equations obtained for the general case are applied to the fmo complex .",
    "we show that for certain frequencies of the vibronic mode , the energy transfer is strongly suppressed .",
    "to explain these results , we determine the time dependencies of the chromophore populations and show that , for these frequencies , the excitation does not effectively reach the chromophore coupled to the reaction center , despite the fact that it has the lowest energy .",
    "we argue that this effect is the result of the exitonic - vibrational coherence @xcite , when the _ polaronic mode _ is formed and the excitation is transferred between two excitonic states with the emission / absorption of vibronic quanta , instead of proceeding to the reaction center .",
    "eventually , the excitation energy is dissipated .",
    "the same effect can suppress the quantum beating which occurs in the populations of the first and second pigments . at a certain frequency of the vibronic mode ,",
    "the polaronic mode forms between the first and sixth pigments and the exciton is transferred to the sixth chromofore instead of the second one . however ,",
    "if the vibronic mode is strongly coupled to a specific ( third ) pigment , the efficiency of the energy transfer is even enhanced .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section ii contains the hamiltonian of the system . in section iii",
    ", we determine the density matrix and derive its equations of motion .",
    "the efficiency of the energy transfer is defined in section iv .",
    "this approach is applied to the fmo complex in section v , where we find the dependence of the energy transfer efficiency on the frequency of the vibronic mode strongly coupled to the system and calculate the time dependencies of the chromophores populations .",
    "section vi contains the conclusions of our work .",
    "we start from the general description of the exciton transfer through a system of @xmath0 chromophores when these are coupled to each other , and each one of them can be coupled to the light source , reaction center , quenching and blackbody radiation fields , as well as the protein environment . in addition , the interaction with a specific strong vibronic mode is included .",

    "in this section , we apply the equations obtained above to a specific system , fmo complex containing seven pigments .",

    "one can see that with decreasing frequency , the efficiency starts to drop at approximately 16 mev .",
    "this drop can be quite significant , up to 4 times at low frequencies .",
    "we also show in this figure the efficiency value for case when there is no strong coupling to the specific vibronic mode which equals to 0.8314 for our set of parameters . for our calculations ,",

    "we calculate the time dependence of the pigment populations with the results shown in fig .",
    "4(a - f ) . for initial conditions",
    ", we use the situation when the first pigment ( coupled to the light ) is populated and all other bchls are not . with no strong coupling to the vibronic mode ( fig .",
    "4a ) , there are well - known quantum oscillations of populations of the first and second pigments ( for times of about 0.5 ps ) and by the time of about 3 ps the exciton energy is mostly transferred to the third pigment coupled to the reaction center .",
    "it should be noted that the fifth , sixth , and seventh pigments remain unpopulated all the time .",
    "almost the same picture can be seen for the high frequency of the vibronic mode ( fig .",
    "with the frequency decreasing , the fifth , sixth , and seventh pigments start to be populated and at @xmath94 mev all seven bchls are populated almost equally by 3 ps .",
    "it should be emphasized that the energies of the bchl 3 and bchl 4 , bchl 4 and bchl 5 , and bchl 5 and bchl 6 , are all separated by 16 - 19 mev .",
    "accordingly , the strong coupling to the vibronic modes of appropriate frequency with the preservation of `` vibronic coherence '' @xcite can lead to the formation of `` polaronic modes '' between corresponding pigments . as the coupling to the vibronic mode is strong , multi - phonon interaction is possible .",
    "formally , it corresponds to non - vanishing contributions of the high - order bessel functions of eqs .",
    "( a15 ) and ( a16 ) .",
    "moreover , one can see from these equations that the interference between the specific mode and heat bath modes is possible , therefore the energy mismatch preventing the polaronic mode formation can be compensated by the heat bath . as a result , the exciton , which is transferred to bchl 3 from bchl 2 , does not proceed to the reaction center , but oscillates between bchls 3 , 4 5 , and 6 and the energy is eventually lost to the quenching field or the heat bath .    of special interest",
    "is the suppression of the quantum beating between bchl 1 and bchl 2 at @xmath31 = 25 mev , fig .",
    "4e . it can be a result of similar polaronic mode formation .",
    "the separation between the energies of bchl 1 and bchl 6 is about 24 mev , so vibronic - assisted transfer between these pigments is possible .",
    "correspondingly , the exciton proceeds to the third pigment not via bchl 2 but via bchls 6 , 5 , and 4 .",
    "it should be noted that the energy efficiency is _ not _ suppressed at this frequency .",
    "our approach allows us to examine the situation when the vibronic mode is deliberately coupled to a specific pigment . in fig .  5",
    ", we show the energy transfer efficiency as a function of the vibronic mode frequency , when only the bchl 3 is coupled to the vibronic mode .",
    "one can see that the efficiency is suppressed at low frequencies but not as drastically as in fig .",
    "the reason for such relatively small suppression is that the polaronic mode is formed between the bchl 3 and bchl 4 only , with no exciton transfer farther to bchls 5 and 6 .",
    "however , it is evident from fig .",
    "5 that at @xmath31 = 30 mev , the energy transfer efficiency even exceeds the value for no coupling to the vibronic mode .",
    "the corresponding time dependencies of the pigment populations are shown in fig .",
    "6 . for @xmath31 = 4 mev ,",
    "6a , bchls 5 and 6 remain unpopulated , in contrast to fig .",
    "4b , when all the sites are coupled to the vibronic mode .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "6b that for @xmath31 = 30 mev the population of bchl 3 at 3 ps is even higher than that of the unperturbed system , fig .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed an approach allowing to study the exciton transfer through a network for the case when the reorganization energy is of the order of the inter - site couplings .",
    "our method is not restricted to the one - particle case , so we can describe the propagation of several excitons through the system .",
    "we have taken into account the effects of radiative and quenching baths , as well as the coupling to the reaction center , perturbatively with the secular approximation .",
    "we have gone beyond this approximation for the protein environment examining the non - markovian effects as well .",
    "while the majority vibronic modes have been treated as a heat bath , we have also included the strong coupling to a specific vibronic mode into consideration .",
    "for the heat bath modes , we have used a high temperature ( or low frequency ) approximation for the dynamics inside the non - markovian integral , while the specific mode was treated exactly .",
    "accordingly , we have determined the contributions of multi - phonon processes and obtained that the contributions of the heat bath modes and the vibronic mode are interconnected , as the frequency and the reorganization energy of the vibronic mode is involved in the relaxation matrix for the heat bath and vice versa .",
    "we have obtained the efficiency of the energy transfer directly , as the ratio of the energy transferred to the reaction center and the total energy absorbed by the system .",
    "we have calculated this efficiency for a specific system , the fmo complex , and found that this efficiency is dropped significantly , if the energy of the strongly - coupled vibronic mode becomes smaller than 16 mev .",
    "we have attributed that to the formation of `` polaronic modes '' where the exciton is transferred back and forth between two pigments with absorption and emission of vibronic quanta .",
    "accordingly , the exciton instead of proceeding to the reaction center from the lowest - energy bchl 3 , is transferred sequentially to bchls 4 , 5 , and 6 , and the energy is eventually lost to the quenching field or to the environment heat bath .",
    "we have illustrated this effect determining the time dependencies of the pigment populations and showing that for the low frequency of the strongly - coupled vibronic mode , the exciton is almost equally distributed between all the pigments .",
    "we have obtained the well - known oscillations in the populations of bchl 1 and bchl 2 and showed that these oscillations are suppressed at the vibronic mode frequency of 30 mev .",
    "this corresponds to the separation of the energies of bchls 1 and 6 and we attribute this effect to the polaronic mode between these pigments and the energy transfer avoiding bchl 2 .",
    "it is interesting that it does not affect the energy transfer efficiency .",
    "we have also shown that the efficiency can even be enhanced if the specific vibronic mode is coupled deliberately to bchl 3 . in this case",
    ", the obtained value exceeds that for the unperturbed complex .",

    "<S> using methods of condensed matter and statistical physics , we examine the transport of excitons through the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex from a receiving antenna to a reaction center . writing the equations of motion for the exciton creation / annihilation operators , we are able to describe the exciton dynamics , even in the regime when the reorganization energy is of the order of the intra - system couplings . in particular , we obtain the well - known quantum oscillations of the site populations . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the exciton transfer efficiency in the presence of a quenching field and protein environment . </S>",
    "<S> while the majority of the protein vibronic modes are treated as a heat bath , we address the situation when specific modes are strongly coupled to excitons and examine the effects of these modes on the quantum oscillations and the energy transfer efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for the vibronic frequencies below 16 mev , the exciton transfer is drastically suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this effect to the formation of `` polaronic states '' where the exciton is transferred back and forth between the two pigments with the absorption / emission of the vibronic quanta , instead of proceeding to the reaction center . </S>",
    "<S> the same effect suppresses the quantum beating at the vibronic frequency of 25 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the efficiency of the energy transfer can be enhanced when the vibronic mode strongly couples to the third pigment only , instead of coupling to the entire system . </S>"
