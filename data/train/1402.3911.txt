    "materials can respond to applied electromagnetic field via both electric and magnetic susceptibilities .",
    "while dielectrics demonstrate relatively high values of permittivities even at high frequencies ( ultraviolet spectral range or lower ) , inherent natural permeabilities rapidly approach unity , having certain high - frequency cut - off around mhz frequencies  @xcite .",
    "this natural property results from relatively fast electronic polarizabilities and electronic band structure that has resonances at optical frequencies and slow spin and orbital interactions which define the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "nevertheless , optical magnetism can be artificially created via carefully engineered subwavelength structures .",
    "for example , arrays of ordered split - ring resonators , made of conducting metals , can create artificial magnetic responses at high frequencies ( thz range ) and even produce negative effective permeabilities  @xcite .",
    "similar concepts can be also employed in optics . with proper choice of shape of metallic nanostructures and their arrangements ,",
    "called metamaterials , artificial magnetism has been demonstrated in the infra - red and visible spectral range  @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental bottlenecks , limiting the performance of plasmonic components and metamaterials is inherent material losses that is of great importance for various nanophotonic components , such as nanolenses  @xcite , antennas  @xcite , particle - based waveguides  @xcite , ordered particle arrays  @xcite , and biosensors  @xcite . at the same time , high refractive index dielectric nanoparticles have shown to be promising in the context of artificial magnetism and the majority of aforementioned components can be implemented with all - dielectric elements , as was already demonstrated in case of ordered particle arrays  @xcite and antenna applications  @xcite .",
    "resonant phenomena in positive permittivity particles , in contrary to subwavelength plasmonic structures , rely on the retardation effects .",
    "nevertheless , high index spherical particles of nanometric dimensions can exhibit multiple resonances in the visible spectral range .",
    "in particular , strong resonant light scattering associated with the excitation of magnetic and electric dipolar modes in silicon nanoparticles has recently been demonstrated experimentally using dark - field optical microscopy  @xcite and directional light scattering by spherical silicon nanoparticles in the visible spectral range has been reported  @xcite .",
    "while the majority of theoretical studies consider isolated spherical particles or their clusters in free space , very often experimental geometries involve the presence of substrates where nanoparticles are placed  @xcite .",
    "therefore , investigations of substrate effects on magnetic dipole resonances in dielectric nanoparticles are of great importance for understanding both fundamental phenomena and predictions of experimental measurements . in this paper , we performed numerical studies of optical properties of high - index dielectric nanoparticles on various types of substrates .",
    "in particular , glass , gold and hyperbolic metamaterial substrates were considered .",
    "optical properties of nanoparticles were characterized via scattering cross - section spectra , electric field profiles , and induced electric and magnetic moments .",
    "optical response of individual spherical particles embedded in homogeneous host materials can be described analytically via the mie series decomposition  @xcite . generally , any shape with boundaries belonging to `` coordinate surfaces '' sets at coordinate systems where helmholtz equation is separable , i.e. , has analytic solution for scattering problems .",
    "however , the separation of variables method breaks down once substrates are introduced . as the first order approximation",
    ", the image theory could be employed  @xcite , while more complex treatments can account for retardation effects and higher multi - pole interactions  @xcite .",
    "considerations of anisotropic substrates lead to major complexity even in the image theory ( point charge images should be replaced by certain distributions )  @xcite and make fully analytical approaches to be of limited applicability .",
    "moreover , in the case of high - index dielectric particles , the resonances are overlapping in frequency , making even the image theory to be inapplicable . at the same time , this spectral overlap can be employed for super - directive antenna applications  @xcite .",
    "one of the commonly used techniques for numerical analysis of scattering processes is the so - called `` total - field scattered - field '' ( tfsf ) approach  @xcite .",
    "the key advantage of this method is the separation of relatively weak scattered field ( sf ) from predominating high amplitude total field ( tf ) which contains both incident and scattered fields , in a distinct simulation domain .",
    "the tfsf method also allows to subtract the electric field , reflected backwards by the substrate in the sf domain , enabling the calculation of a scattering cross - section",

    "fdtd method allows analyzing spectral responses via single simulation by adopting the fourier decomposition method with subsequent normalization .",
