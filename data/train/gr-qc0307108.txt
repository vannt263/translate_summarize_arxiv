    "in the context of exact solutions of einstein s field equations , gravitational radiation has been studied for decades . in particular",
    ", various techniques have been developed to rigorously characterize asymptotic properties of the gravitational field , i.e. , the geometry of spacetime at from bounded sources .    in the fundamental work",
    "@xcite gravitational waves emitted by axisymmetric systems were analyzed by considering an expansion of metric functions in inverse powers of an appropriate coordinate @xmath2 parametrizing outgoing null geodesics .",
    "in particular , the news function was defined that characterizes radiation , and which is related to a decreasing ( bondi ) mass of the source .",
    "generalizations and refinement of this method , with a deeper understanding of its relation to the petrov types ( such as the peeling - off behavior of the weyl tensor ) were subsequently achieved in @xcite , see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews . nevertheless , in these works the analysis of radiative fields remained confined to _ asymptotically flat _",
    "spacetimes thus ruling out , for instance , the presence of a nonvanishing cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , it was based on the use of privileged coordinate systems .",
    "it was penrose @xcite , see @xcite for a comprehensive overview , who introduced a _",
    "_ approach to the definition of radiation for massless fields , which is based on the conformal treatment of infinity ( a comparison of the bondi - sachs and penrose approaches was recently presented in @xcite ) .",
    "this enables one to apply methods of local differential geometry , and thus to define in a rigorous geometric way such basic concepts as the bondi mass , the peeling - off property , and the bondi - metzner - sachs group of asymptotic symmetries .",
    "in particular , gravitational radiation propagating along a given null geodesic is described by the @xmath3 component of the weyl tensor projected on a parallelly transported complex null tetrad at infinity .",
    "the crucial point is that such a tetrad is ( essentially ) determined _ uniquely _ by the conformal geometry @xcite .",
    "moreover , an advantage of the penrose method is that it can be naturally applied also to asymptotically simple spacetimes which _ include the cosmological constant _ @xcite .",
    "this is quite remarkable since there is no analogue of the news function in the presence of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , specific new features appear in the case of asymptotically de  sitter ( @xmath4 ) or anti  de  sitter ( @xmath5 ) spacetimes , for which the conformal infinity  @xmath6 is , respectively , spacelike or timelike @xcite .",
    "first of all , the concept of radiation for a massless field is in cases when @xmath6 is not null .",
    "namely , it emerges as necessarily direction dependent since the choice of the above - mentioned null tetrad , and thus the radiative component @xmath3 of the field , turns out to be _ different _ for different null geodesics reaching the same point on @xmath6 .",
    "this is related to the fact that with nonvanishing @xmath1 even fields of _ nonaccelerated _ sources are _ radiative _ along a _",
    "generic _ direction , as it has been shown for test charges @xcite or for reissner - nordstrm black holes @xcite in a de  sitter universe , and it will be shown here for a negative @xmath1 ( sec .  [",
    "ssc : vanishinga ] ) .",
    "in addition , the character of infinity plays a crucial role in the formulation of the initial value problem .",
    "a spacelike @xmath6 implies the insufficiency of purely retarded massless fields so that , for example , in de  sitter space purely retarded solutions of the maxwell equations are impossible for generic charge distributions @xcite . on the other hand , it is wellknown that a timelike @xmath6 prevents the existence of a cauchy surface , and one is necessarily led to a kind of , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for all the above reasons , the definition of radiation is much less obvious when @xmath7 .",
    "any explicit exact example of a source which generates gravitational waves in an ( anti)de  sitter universe is thus of paramount importance since this may provide us with insight into the character of radiation in spacetimes which are not asymptotically flat .",
    "exact solutions with boost - rotation symmetry @xcite , which represent radiative spacetimes with uniformly accelerating sources , play a unique role when @xmath8 . among these the @xmath0-metric , which describes accelerated black holes , admits a natural generalization to a nonvanishing value of the cosmological constant , and",
    "it will thus be considered in the present paper .",
    "the @xmath0-metric @xcite is a classic solution of the einstein(-maxwell ) equations which has been physically interpreted and analyzed in fundamental papers @xcite and in many other works , see e.g. @xcite for references and summary of the results .",
    "a generalization of the standard @xmath0-metric to admit a nonvanishing value of @xmath1 has also been known for a long time @xcite , cf .",
    "@xcite ( also , related solutions have been obtained by considering extremal limits of the @xmath0-metric with an arbitrary @xmath1 @xcite ) . these spacetimes have found successful application to the problem of cosmological pair creation of black holes @xcite . however , a deeper understanding of their physical and global properties , including the character of radiation , has been missing until recently .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath0-metric solutions with @xmath9 , in particular the meaning of parameters in the metric and the relation to the de  sitter universe , was clarified in @xcite by introducing an appropriate coordinate system adapted to uniformly accelerated observers .",
    "the causal structure was further studied in @xcite for various choices of the physical parameters .",
    "very recently @xcite , we have carefully analyzed the @xmath0-metric with @xmath9 and , among other results , we have demonstrated that gravitational and electromagnetic fields of this exact solution exhibit asymptotically a _ specific directional pattern of radiation _ at @xmath6 .",
    "interestingly , this directional dependence of fields on null directions from which the conformal infinity is approached is the same as for the test fields of uniformly accelerated charges in a de  sitter universe @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we wish to investigate an analogous asymptotic behavior of fields of the @xmath0-metric with @xmath10 , i.e. , the directional dependence at conformal infinity @xmath6 of radiation generated by uniformly accelerated ( possibly charged ) black holes in an anti ",
    "de  sitter universe .",
    "some fundamental differences from the cases @xmath11 appear since @xmath6 now has a _ timelike _ character .",
    "in fact , the whole structure of the is much more complex and new peculiar phenomena thus occur .",
    "as observed in @xcite and thoroughly studied in the recent work @xcite , for a small value of acceleration , @xmath12 , the metric describes a _ single _ uniformly accelerated black hole in an anti ",
    "de  sitter universe @xcite whereas for @xmath13 this represents _ a pair _ of accelerated black holes .",
    "the given by @xmath14 , previously investigated in @xcite , plays a special important role in the context of the randall - sundrum model since it describes a black hole bound to a two - brane in four dimensions .",
    "however , this case is not investigated in the present work .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .",
    "[ sc : cmetric ] we present the @xmath0-metric solution with a negative cosmological constant , in particular the robinson - trautman coordinates which will be used in the subsequent analysis .",

    "[ sc : radchar][sc : analysis ] contain the core of our analysis .",
    "first we define a suitable interpretation tetrad parallelly transported along null geodesics approaching asymptotically a given point on conformal infinity @xmath6 from all possible spacetime directions .",
    "the magnitude of the leading terms of gravitational and electromagnetic fields in such a tetrad then provides us with a specific directional pattern of radiation .",
    "convenient parametrizations of null directions approaching @xmath6 are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sc : param ] , and the results are subsequently described and analyzed in sec .  [",
    "sc : analysis ] .",
    "this is done for both the cases of a single black hole and a pair of black holes accelerating in an anti  de  sitter universe ( and for vanishing acceleration ) .",
    "the paper also contains two appendixes . in appendix",
    "[ apx : algspecdir ] the behavior of radiation along special null directions is studied .",
    "in particular , for geodesics along principal null directions the results are obtained in closed explicit form without performing asymptotic expansions of the physical quantities near @xmath15 .",
    "appendix  [ apx : transformations ] summarizes the lorentz transformations of the null - tetrad components of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields .",
    "the @xmath0-metric with a cosmological constant @xmath10 , contained in the family of solutions @xcite , can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , respectively , polynomials of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 these functions are mutually related by @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the metric is a solution of the einstein - maxwell equations with a non - null electromagnetic field given by @xmath24 or related expressions which can be obtained by a constant duality rotation .",
    "there exist two double - degenerate principal null directions ( pnds ) @xmath25 so that the spacetime is of the petrov type @xmath26 .",

    "the metric can describe different spacetimes , depending on the choice of parameters and of ranges of coordinates .",
    "we are interested in the physically most relevant case when the metric describes one black hole or pairs of black holes uniformly accelerated in anti  de  sitter universe . in this case the constants @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 , characterize acceleration , mass , charge of the black holes , and conicity of the @xmath35 symmetry axis , respectively .",
    "they have to satisfy @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and they have to be such that the function @xmath18 has four real roots in the charged case ( @xmath39 ) or three real roots in the uncharged case ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) .",

    "[ fig : cadsi](d ) and [ fig : cadsiixy ] below ) . from these conditions",
    "we obtain @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the spacetime reduces to the anti ",
    "de  sitter universe for @xmath48 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath35 are longitudinal and latitudinal angular coordinates , @xmath49 denotes the axis of @xmath35 symmetry extending from the pole of the black hole ( in the direction of acceleration ) to infinity , whereas @xmath50 denotes the axis from the opposite pole .",
    "for nonvanishing acceleration the axis can not be regular everywhere  at least one part of it has to have a nontrivial conicity , depending on the choice of the parameter @xmath33 .",
    "this corresponds to the presence of cosmic strings ( or struts ) which are responsible for the acceleration of the black holes , see the references above for more details .",
    "the spacetime metric can be put into various forms . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on investigation of radiation near infinity , for which the robinson - trautman form seems to be a convenient one . introducing real",
    "coordinates @xmath51 , @xmath52 and complex coordinates @xmath53 by @xmath54 we put the @xmath0-metric into the form of two 1-forms is defined as @xmath55 . ]",
    "@xmath56 the metric functions are @xmath57 or explicitly @xmath58 with @xmath59 , where @xmath20 is expressed using the relation @xmath60 the functions , represent a particular case , corresponding to the @xmath0-metric , of the standard general expression for the robinson - trautman spacetimes @xcite .",
    "as opposed to the metric form , the robinson - trautman coordinates allow an explicit limit @xmath61 .",
    "the coordinates are not defined globally but it is possible to cover the whole universe by many coordinate patches of the same type .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to study the spacetime only in just one robinson - trautman coordinate map ; such a patch is indicated by a shaded domain in figs .",
    "[ fig : cadsiia][fig : cadsiic ] .",
    "we additionally assume there that the coordinate @xmath52 is increasing from the past to the future .",
    "the global causal structure of the @xmath0-metric with @xmath10 has recently been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the character of infinity , singularities , and possible horizons has been described in detail .",
    "_ infinity _ @xmath6 of the spacetime is given by @xmath62 where the conformal factor @xmath63 vanishes .",
    "the conformal ( unphysical ) metric @xmath64 @xmath65 is regular at infinity , given by @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , it follows from eq .",
    "that at @xmath6 the metric function reads @xmath67 i.e .. it is independent of the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the vector @xmath68 is orthogonal to each hypersurface @xmath69 . in particular",
    ", it is outgoing and normal to infinity @xmath6 at any of its point , with the norm @xmath70 .",
    "the universe is thus weakly asymptotically anti ",

    "however , it will be more convenient to employ the spacelike outward vector @xmath73 orthogonal to @xmath6 , @xmath74 which has a unit norm @xmath75 with respect to the _ physical _ metric .    at @xmath76",
    "the metric has unbounded curvature which corresponds to a physical singularity hidden behind the black hole horizon .",
    "similarly to the @xmath0-metric with vanishing @xmath1 @xcite or the @xmath0-metric with @xmath9 @xcite , the zeros of the function @xmath17 correspond to _ killing horizons _ associated with @xmath27 .",

    "@xmath6 the pnds are mutually mirrored reflections , @xmath83 oriented outside the universe and @xmath84 inside it , parametrized by @xmath366 , see eqs .",
    "both the pnds point in radial directions of the spherical symmetry .",
    "moreover , since @xmath334 , it follows from relation that the region near @xmath6 is always static , without the killing horizon extending there .",
    "the directional patterns of outgoing / ingoing radiation are the same and axially symmetric when @xmath367 .",
    "in such a case the pnds @xmath83 and @xmath84 are mutual mirror images under reflection with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , there is exactly one direction given by @xmath368 along which the radiation vanishes , both for outgoing and ingoing null geodesics . ]    for vanishing acceleration the expressions and reduce to @xmath369 the corresponding directional pattern of radiation , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpr00 ] , is axially symmetric and independent of @xmath190 , i.e. , it is the same both for ingoing and outgoing null geodesics .",
    "interestingly , even for a nonaccelerated black hole there is thus radiation on @xmath6 along _ any nonradial _",
    "null direction , i.e. , except for @xmath370 , @xmath371 , which corresponds to both pnds .",
    "this may seem quite surprising since the region near infinity is _",
    "static_. it is a completely new specific feature : for @xmath9 a generic , nonradial observer near @xmath372 would also detect radiation generated by nonaccelerated black holes @xcite , but the region near infinity is nonstatic . in asymptotically flat spacetimes ( @xmath8 ) there is no radiation on @xmath372 from black holes with @xmath61 @xcite , which , remarkably , also follows from expression .",
    "it was observed already in the 1960s by penrose @xcite that radiation is defined in spacetimes with a non - null @xmath6 .",
    "recently we have analyzed the @xmath0-metric solution with @xmath9 @xcite and found an explicit directional pattern of radiation .",

    "here we have completed the picture by investigating the radiative properties of the @xmath0-metric with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "this exact solution of the einstein - maxwell equations with @xmath10 represents a spacetime in which the radiation is generated either by a ( possibly charged ) single black hole or pairs of black holes uniformly accelerated in an anti  de  sitter universe .",
    "we have analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields near the conformal infinity @xmath6 , which has a timelike character .",
    "the leading components of the fields have been expressed in a suitable parallelly transported interpretation tetrad .",
    "these components are inversely proportional to the affine parameter of the corresponding null geodesic .",
    "in addition , an explicit formula [ or , equivalently , eqs .   and ] which describes the directional pattern of radiation has been derived : it expresses the dependence of the field magnitudes on spacetime directions from which a given point @xmath138 at infinity @xmath6 is approached .",
    "this specific directional characteristic supplements the peeling property , completing thus the asymptotic behavior of gravitational and electromagnetic fields near infinity @xmath6 with a timelike character .",
    "we have demonstrated that the situation is much more complicated in the anti ",
    "de  sitter case than in the case @xmath9 .",
    "the new specific feature is that timelike conformal infinity @xmath6 is , in general , divided by killing horizons into several static and nonstatic regions with a different structure of ( double degenerate ) principal null directions . in these distinct domains of infinity",
    "the directional patterns of radiation differ .",
    "for example , there are different numbers of geometrically privileged directions ( namely one , two , or none ) in which the radiation vanishes completely .",
    "these exactly correspond to mirrored directions of principal null direction , with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "accordingly , there exists an asymmetry between outgoing and ingoing radiation patterns in all the domains .    as in the @xmath9 case @xcite",
    ", it seems plausible that a general structure of the radiation pattern at conformal infinity depends only on the pnds there , i.e. , it is given by the algebraic ( petrov ) type of the spacetime .",
    "this hypothesis will be proven elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the work was supported in part by the grants gar 202/02/0735 and gauk 166/2003 of the czech republic and charles university in prague .",
    "the stay of m.o . at the institute of theoretical physics in prague was enabled by financial support from fondazione angelo della riccia ( firenze ) .",
    "here we concentrate on a geometrically privileged family of special geodesics which asymptotically take the form eq .   with @xmath373 .",
    "it follows from that this corresponds either to outgoing null geodesics with @xmath374 or ingoing ones with @xmath375 .",
    "in fact , the geodesics @xmath376 are _ exact null geodesics _",
    "@xmath377 in the whole spacetime , with @xmath51 being their affine parameter .",

    "consequently , we can naturally set the interpretation tetrad @xmath384 in the _ whole _",
    "spacetime , not only asymptotically near @xmath6 , as in for @xmath373 , @xmath374 . as follows from eqs .",
    ", all components of gravitational and electromagnetic fields are explicitly given by @xmath385 and @xmath386 clearly , the leading terms in the @xmath169 expansion give the previous general asymptotical results with @xmath376 .",
    "in the case of anti  de  sitter spacetime ( @xmath387 , @xmath40 ) the field components obviously identically vanish . in the general case",
    "the fields have a radiative character ( @xmath388 ) except for a vanishing acceleration  @xmath30 and/or for @xmath389 .",
    "the interesting limiting case @xmath61 has been already discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssc : vanishinga ] .",
    "the case @xmath389 corresponds to observers located at the privileged position where @xmath390 , i.e. , on the axes @xmath91 and @xmath92 where the strings / struts are localized .",
    "this is analogous to the situation when @xmath4 @xcite , and an electromagnetic field of accelerated test charges in flat spacetime : this is also not radiative along the axis of symmetry , which is the direction of acceleration .",
    "let us also recall ( see @xcite ) that the affine parameter @xmath51 coincides both with the luminosity and the parallax distance for the congruence of the above null geodesics .",
    "the radiative @xmath169 fall - off of the fields is naturally measurable ( even locally ) by observers moving radially to infinity , using both the luminosity and the parallax methods for determining the distance .    concerning the other special family of ingoing null geodesics , @xmath373 , @xmath375 , @xmath391",
    ", it can be observed that the transformation given by becomes singular and is not thus justified .",

    ", it follows that in this case @xmath392 which  somewhat surprisingly  fully agrees with expressions for the special case @xmath373 , @xmath375 .",
