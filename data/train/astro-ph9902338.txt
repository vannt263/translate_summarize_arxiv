    "in a recent paper @xcite , we have studied the back reaction of cosmological gravitons on the cosmic dynamics during the radiation epoch .",
    "the analysis was based on the following reasoning : the inequivalence of vacuum states at different moments of time leads to the production of tensor perturbations in scales larger than the hubble length [ 1  8 ] . during noninflationary periods of expansion ,",
    "these very long tensor perturbations ( vltp s ) become effective gravitational waves ( egw s ) as they enter the hubble radius , thus adding new contributions to the energy density associated with the subhorizon waves @xmath1 [ 1  5 ] , @xcite .",
    "such a phenomenum can be studied as a process of creation of effective gravitons by using the macroscopic formalism to matter creation based on the thermodynamics of open systems @xcite . in order to deal with the process",
    ", a creation pressure term is introduced in the continuity equation obeyed by @xmath1 . a dynamical equation for the scale factor @xmath2",
    "is then derived which takes into account the effective gravitons back reaction .",
    "full details of this approach can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the equation for @xmath2 was numerically solved for a model in which the universe evolves from an arbitrary initial phase to a radiation dominated era .",
    "it was found that , if the barotropic index @xmath3 of the equation of state in the first epoch is close to @xmath4 , the back reaction of the effective gravitational waves makes @xmath2 deviate appreciably from the standard behavior @xmath5 .    in the present paper",
    "we extend our analysis to the matter dominated period of the cosmic expansion .",
    "in particular , we aim to check a conjecture stated by sahni @xcite , according to which the process mentioned above would ultimately lead the universe to expand linearly with time ( @xmath6 ) , since the tensor perturbations would enter the hubble radius during noninflationary periods of expansion ( increasing @xmath1 ) and leave the hubble radius during inflationary periods ( decreasing @xmath1 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the scale factor would turn from @xmath5 to @xmath6 only if @xmath7 .",
    "several models with the universe evolving linearly with time during its early phases have been proposed , most of them related to string motivated cosmologies @xcite .",
    "an universe evolving linearly with time during most of its history would lead to important observational consequences , such as those related to the age of the universe , to the luminosity distance - redshift and the angular diameter distance - redshift relations , and to the galaxy number count as a function of the redshift @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we should remark that , in order to the mechanism of graviton creation take place , no ` exotic ' physics has to be assumed .",
    "it only requires the validity of quantum mechanics and of general relativity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of the possible influence of the cosmological gravitational waves in the expansion dynamics has an importance on its own , a fact that has not been fully appreciated in the literature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s2 ] we present the basic equations related to the spectrum of cosmological gravitational waves . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we derive the dynamical equations that govern the expansion dynamics during the matter age , taking into account the gravitons back reaction . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we show the numerical solutions of these equations and present our conclusions .",
    "the system of units used is such that @xmath8 .",
    "we will consider a homogeneous and isotropic universe , for which the background line element takes the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , the cosmic and conformal times , related by @xmath12 we will restrict ourselves to the spatially flat case . if the pressure @xmath13 and energy density @xmath14 of the cosmic fluid are related by the equation of state @xmath15 then the scale factor is @xcite @xmath16^{2/(3\\gamma)}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we will further assume that the universe evolves from an initial arbitrary era ( @xmath19 ) to a radiation dominated phase ( @xmath20 ) and then to a matter dominated period ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "as the inequivalence of vacua appear at different instants of time , we will focus on the time - dependent amplitude of the tensor perturbations @xmath22 , which obeys @xcite @xmath23 in the above equation the primes indicate derivatives with respect to the conformal time and @xmath24 is the comoving wave number , related to the physical wavelength @xmath25 and frequency @xmath26 by @xmath27 the properly normalized solutions of eq .",

    "the spectrum of the egw s can be described by the quantity @xmath28 , defined in such a way that @xmath29 represents the energy per unit volume between the frequencies @xmath26 and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "note that this quantity can be defined only for the egw s @xcite , i.e. , for those perturbations such that @xmath31 in the units used in this paper and assuming an initial vacuum state , @xmath28 is given by @xcite @xmath32 in the above equation @xmath33 is the expectation number of the gravitons with frequency @xmath26 which is found to be @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( see below ) are the bogoliubov coeficients relating the creation and annihilation operators ( which define the particle states ) of different epochs .",
    "we will denote by @xmath37 , @xmath38 the coeficients associated with the first transition from an arbitrary phase to the radiation dominated era , and by @xmath39 , @xmath40 those related with the transition from the radiation to the matter dominated epoch .",
    "these coefficents have been obtained in references @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath41 is then given by @xcite @xmath42 and the asterisk indicates the complex conjugate of a quantity .",
    "the total energy density associated with the tensor perturbations is obtained by integrating @xmath28 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 this infrared cutoff is obviously related to the condition ( [ e7 ] ) and , since it is time dependent , it is the origin of the process of creation of egw s . in a frw scenario , it will be responsible for the fact that @xmath1 does not decay with @xmath45 , as one could expect for a massless particle such as the graviton .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ e11 ] ) is usually written with a finite upper limit .",
    "this is done because the above method for obtaining the spectrum , based on the sudden transition approximation between cosmic eras , does not give accurate results for high frequency waves .",
    "in fact , it is reliable only for those waves whose periods are much greater than the transitions time scales @xcite .",
    "however , due to the adiabatic theorem @xcite , the number of created particles should decrease exponentially for the high frequency modes .",
    "hence , an ultraviolet cutoff is imposed and the error produced by doing so is supposed to be small .",
    "our present results will not be affected by this approximation since we are obviously interested only on the very long modes .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will suppose that , prior to the time @xmath46 the dominant material content of the universe has an equation of state of the form ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "this stage can be either an inflationary or a noninflationary one . at @xmath46",
    "a transition occurs , so that the new barotropic parameter is @xmath47 . due to the transition ,",
    "tensor perturbations are created @xcite . some of these have wavelengths less than @xmath48 ( egw s ) , but most are created with scales larger than @xmath48 ( vltp s )",
    ". a similar phenomenom will occurr at a time @xmath49 when the universe becomes matter dominated ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we will further assume that during this matter dominated period and until a time , say , @xmath51 , the energy density @xmath1 associated with the egw s is negligible compared with the energy density of matter @xmath52 .",
    "there is no restriction over the size of the interval @xmath53 , that can be taken to be arbitrarily small .",
    "however , after @xmath51 , the ongoing transformation of vltp s into egw s makes the continuous increase of @xmath1 start perturbing the dynamics .",
    "thereafter , the universe can be supposed to be filled by two fluids : dust and the one composed by the effective gravitons .",
    "the _ total _",
    "energy density is then @xmath54 .",
    "as gravitons require extremely high energies to interact with matter @xcite , the two fluids can be safely considered to be noninteracting .",
    "the effective gravitons behave as a perfect fluid with equation of state @xcite @xmath55 nevertheless , it is possible to associate a creation pressure term @xmath56 to the creation process of these gravitons @xcite .",
    "the field equations are then written as @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 where the dots indicate derivatives with respect to the cosmic time , @xmath60 is the pressure of the dust fluid and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the number density and creation rate of the effective gravitons , respectively .",
    "this last equation is the novel aspect introduced by the phenomenological formalism to particle ( in this case , gravitons ) creation @xcite .",
    "the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor leads to @xmath63 where @xmath14 is the total energy density ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath13 is the total pressure ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) .",
    "as the two fluids are noninteracting , this conservation equation can be split into @xmath67 and @xmath68 from eqs .",

    ". however , the net effect of decreasing the duration of the radiation era is to change the present value of @xmath155 .",
    "we are led to conclude that the transformation of very long tensor perturbations into effective gravitational waves does not change the expansion dynamics during the matter epoch .",
    "this is in contrast to what happens during the radiation era , as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . therefore",
    ", the sahni s conjecture @xcite will hold only under very restrictive conditions .",
    "we must remark , however , that , in the model analysed above , we have assumed a standard evolution from a radiation phase with @xmath0 to a dust era with @xmath156 .",
    "we have not taken into account the modifications in the dynamics generated by the gravitons back reaction during the radiation dominated period @xcite . a more realistic model would consider these modifications and _ then _ a transition to a matter dominated era .",
    "the numerical work becomes much more involved in this case .",
    "moreover , primordial nucleosynthesis and the data related to the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background will place severe constraints on the relevant parameters .",
