    "@xcite demonstrated that a fixed ratio of co to recent star formation rate remains a reasonable description of the ensemble of 30 galaxies .    in this paper",

    ", we show important second - order deviations from this simple picture , which can easily be missed by comparing only @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "we find systematic variations in the molecular gas depletion time , @xmath10 as a function of global galaxy properties ( section [ sec : global ] ) and local conditions ( section [ sec : local ] ) .",
    "this analysis includes the first resolved comparison of @xmath10 to the local dust - to - gas ratio , which is expected to play a key role in setting the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor , @xmath13 and we discuss the possibility that @xmath13 drives some of the observed @xmath18 variations .",
    "we explicitly consider the central regions of our targets ( section [ sec : centers ] ) and show strong evidence for lower @xmath10 , i.e. , more efficient star formation , in galaxy centers compared to galaxy disks - a phenomenon that we discuss in context of recent proposals for `` disk '' and `` starburst '' modes of star formation @xcite . in our best - resolved targets",
    "we examine how the scatter in @xmath10 depends on spatial scale ( section [ sec : scatter ] ) .",
    "the relationship appears much shallower than one would expect for uncorrelated averaging in a disk .",
    "this suggests either a high degree of large - scale synchronization in the star formation process or , more likely , widespread systematic , but subtle , variations in @xmath10 due to still - undiagnosed drivers .",
    "thus our conclusions may be abstracted to : _ molecular gas and star formation exhibit a first order one - to - one scaling but we observe important second order variations about this scaling_. these include likely conversion factor effects , efficient nuclear starbursts , and weak systematic variations in @xmath10 that emerge considering scale - dependent scatter or global galaxy properties .",
    "the remainder of this section presents a brief background , section [ sec : data ] describes our data and physical parameter estimation , sections [ sec : scaling ] and [ sec : tdep_vary ] motivate these conclusions , and section [ sec : summary ] synthesizes these results and identifies several key future directions .",
    "following @xcite , astronomers have studied the relationship between gas and the sfr for more than 50 years .",
    "most recent work follows @xcite and compares the surface densities of sfr , @xmath2 , and neutral ( + h@xmath12 ) gas mass , @xmath19 .",
    "recent work focuses heavily on the power law relationship between these surface densities ( the `` schmidt - kennicutt law '' or the `` star formation law '' ) : @xmath20    an alternative approach treats the ratio of gas and sfr as the quantity of interest ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* l08 ) . this ratio can be phrased as a gas depletion time ( @xmath21 ) or its inverse , a star formation efficiency ( @xmath22 ) . these share the same physical meaning , which is the sfr per unit gas .",
    "both convolve a timescale with a true efficiency , for example the lifetime of a molecular cloud with the fraction of gas converted to stars over this time .",
    "we focus exclusively on _ molecular _ gas in this paper and phrase this ratio as the molecular gas depletion time ,    @xmath23    which is the time for star formation to consume the current molecular gas supply .",
    "the state of the field is roughly the following .",
    "@xcite demonstrated a tight , non - linear ( @xmath24 ) scaling between galaxy - averaged @xmath2 and @xmath19 spanning from normal disk galaxies to starbursts . including  improved the agreement between disks and starbursts , but most of the dynamic range and the nonlinear slope was driven by the contrast between the disks and merger - induced starbursts , especially the local ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) population .",
    "the adoption of a single conversion factor for all systems also had significant impact ; adopting the  ulirg \" conversion factor suggested by @xcite for the @xcite starburst data drives the implied slope to @xmath25 .",

    "this suggests that the immediate link is between sfr and h@xmath12 .",
    "a more aggressive conclusion , motivated by the steep , relatively weak relation between @xmath2 and @xmath26 is that star formation in galaxy disks may be broken into two parts : ( 1 ) the formation of stars in molecular clouds and ( 2 ) the balance between h@xmath12 and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* l08 , b08 ) .",
    "the fraction of dense molecular gas also appears to be a key parameter .",
    "@xcite found a roughly fixed ratio of sfr to hcn emission , a dense gas tracer , extending from spiral galaxies to starbursts . over the same range ,",
    "the ratio of sfr to total h@xmath12 , traced by co emission , varies significantly ( though the two relate roughly linearly in their normal galaxy sample ) .",
    "galactic studies also highlight the impact of density on the sfr on cloud scales @xcite .",
    "it remains unclear how the dense gas fraction varies inside galaxy disks , but merger - induced starbursts do show high hcn - to - co ratios @xcite .",
    "sfr tracers and co can both be observed at high redshift .",
    "@xcite demonstrated broad consistency between local h@xmath12-sfr relations and those at @xmath27 .",
    "one key difference at high-@xmath28 is the existence of disk galaxies with @xmath10 only slightly lower than those in local disk galaxies but h@xmath12 surface density , @xmath1 , as high as that found in starbursts in the local universe @xcite .",
    "merger - driven starbursts with similar @xmath1 can have much lower @xmath10 , suggesting the relevance of another parameter to set @xmath29 .",
    "density and the dynamical timescale are both good candidates .",
    "meanwhile , investigations of the milky way and the nearest galaxies have attempted to connect observed scaling relations to the properties of individual star - forming regions .",
    "these are able to recover the galaxy - scale relations at large scale but find enormous scatter in the ratios of sfr tracers to molecular gas on small scales @xcite .",

    "we also show the results of varying the approach to the ir cirrus .",
    "our best - estimate @xmath2 combines h@xmath31 or fuv with 24@xmath42 m after correcting the 24@xmath42 m emission for contamination by an ir cirrus following l12 .",
    "we illustrate the impact of this correction by plotting results for two limiting cases of ir cirrus correction : no cirrus subtraction ( bottom left ) and removing double our best cirrus estimate ( bottom right ) , which we consider a maximum reasonable correction .",
    "data density contours in figure [ fig : by_sfr ] weight each point equally and the large black points indicate the original binned results from figure [ fig : combined ] .",
    "the top left panel of figure [ fig : by_sfr ] and table [ tab : combined ] show that the basic relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath1 persists even when we derive @xmath2 from h@xmath31 alone .",
    "the median @xmath10 and scatter using only h@xmath31 resemble what we find for our best estimate and the correlation between h@xmath31 and co appears only moderately weaker than for the hybrid sfr tracer .",
    "it also appears moderately flatter than relations that incorporate ir emission as we underestimate extinction in the central parts of galaxies (  [ sec : index ] ) .",
    "inasmuch as h@xmath31 represents an unambiguous tracer of recent star formation , the top left panel in figure [ fig : by_sfr ] demonstrates that subtle biases in the treatment of ir emission , e.g. , 24@xmath42 m emission tracing the ism rather than recent star formation , do not drive our results .",
    "the top right panel shows @xmath2 traced by fuv+24@xmath42 m emission .",

    "the agreement of fuv+24@xmath42 m and h@xmath31 with our best estimate h@xmath31 + 24@xmath42 m occur partially because we have designed our sfr tracers to yield self - consistent results ( l12 ) .",

    "@xmath2 tracers that more heavily emphasize 24@xmath42 m exhibit the strongest correlation with @xmath1 traced by co.    doubling the cirrus subtraction leads to an @xmath173 longer @xmath10 , larger scatter , and a mildly weaker correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "this partially reflects uncertainty in the cirrus calculation , which relies on model fits to observed data .",
    "it also reflects the deemphasis of 24@xmath42 m emission , which exhibits a very tight correspondence to co , in favor of h@xmath31 , which still exhibits a good correspondence but with more scatter .",
    "the fraction of data that have upper only limits for @xmath2 also increases , so that extending this analysis to lower surface density will require improved data and methodology .",

    "many of the low @xmath10 ( high @xmath2 ) data in figure [ fig : combined ] arise from small galaxies with low dust - to - gas ratios . with the application of a variable conversion factor ,",
    "our estimate of @xmath1 in these galaxies moves to higher values while @xmath2 remains constant .",
    "the result , visible in the bottom rows of figure [ fig : combine_alpha ] , is that data from these low - mass , low metallicity galaxies now overlap the other points , forming a ( more ) continuous single @xmath2-@xmath1 trend . table [ tab : combined ] reports that the scatter among galaxies drops from @xmath58  dex to @xmath180  dex with the application of the `` @xmath71 '' conversion factor , with the systematic difference in @xmath10 between high and low mass galaxies reduced from a factor of @xmath181 to a factor of @xmath182 .",
    "thus , as we will see in section [ sec : tdep_vary ] , application of a dust - to - gas ratio - dependent conversion factor co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor does affect the derived @xmath2-@xmath1 relation , with the sense of moving many points with low apparent @xmath10 into closer agreement with the distribution defined by large galaxies .",
    "this scenario of a rapidly varying conversion factor and a weakly varying @xmath10 has been discussed in the context of the small magellanic cloud by @xcite and in a theoretical context by @xcite .",

    "because both the observed and predicted trends flatten at high d / g and high metallicities , the zero points ( solar values ) used to compute the theoretical curves might be adjusted to yield better agreement between metallicity and d / g or to better match one theoretical curve or the other to the data .",
    "that is , given the uncertainties in the absolute measurements of both metallicity and d / g , one can `` slide '' the relative positions of the theoretical curves and the d / g and metallicity determinations left and right .",
    "as a result , the differences between the `` @xmath73 '' and `` @xmath71 '' curves should not be overemphasized .",
    "these details aside , the key questions are : to what degree can conversion factor variations explain the global trends seen in figure [ fig : tdep_global ] and are the adopted conversion factors reasonable ? in figure [ fig : tdep_global_corr ] we repeat figure [ fig : tdep_global ] but adopt our `` @xmath71 '' conversion factor rather than fixed @xmath13 .",
    "many correlations of @xmath10 with local properties appear weaker with the `` @xmath71 '' @xmath13 than with a fixed conversion factor .",
    "the more extreme `` @xmath73 '' case removes almost all variation with stellar mass and metallicity , but reverses the trend with dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "thus , the `` @xmath73 '' may represent the simplest single explanation for the bulk of the variation in figure [ fig : tdep_global ] .",

    "it lessens the strength of many correlations but ( marginally ) significant variations in @xmath10 with other properties still exist when using this conversion factor .",
    "both of our conversion factors assume a simple , universal structure for the molecular ism beneath our kpc resolution .",
    "in actuality , the typical surface density of gmcs , the universality of this value , and the balance of gmcs and more diffuse molecular material remain poorly constrained by observations .",

    "some of these differences may be attributed to methodology , but hughes et al .",
    "( in review ) decisively demonstrate that the structure of the molecular ism does vary substantially with environment via a carefully matched comparison m51 , m33 , and the lmc .",
    "they show substantial differences in the probability distribution function of co emission at @xmath302  pc resolution both within and among these galaxies .",
    "given these uncertainties , the best way to read the `` @xmath73 '' conversion factor is a case where @xmath13 depends sharply on the dust - to - gas ratio because most co emission to come from low - extinction lines of sight , @xmath75@xmath76 at milky way dust - to - gas ratios .",
    "in addition to the mixed evidence on surface densities of whole populations , maps of very local clouds ( as in * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "a detailed investigation of gmc structure is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the key points are the following : ( 1 ) the basic structure of the molecular ism remains uncertain at a level that significantly affects our interpretation of integrated co emission , ( 2 ) the structure of the molecular ism does vary substantially with environment , and ( 3 ) observations do appear to admit the possibility of substantial co emission from low - a@xmath303 lines of sight or unbound clouds .",
    "given these caveats , we must view our adopted conversion factors as more schematic than exact , so that subtle differences between the `` @xmath73 '' and `` @xmath71 '' case should not be over - interpreted .",
    "we can say from table [ tab : tdep_global ] and figure [ fig : tdep_global ] and [ fig : tdep_global_corr ] that the conversion factor can explain many of the largest systematic variations in @xmath10 across our data , but probably not all of them .",

    "several natural explanations exist for such trends and a combination of these are almost certainly at play .",

    "if present , will often be in the atomic phase .",
    "higher mass galaxies will have both a higher molecular fraction and stronger dynamical effects such as shear and streaming motions working at suppressing the creation of bound gas .",
    "see @xcite for discussion of analogous effects .",
    "this schematic picture leads to several predictions and is clouded by several complications .",
    "both a prediction and a complication is that in this sketch , the physical state of molecular gas varies systematically as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "this should manifest via several direction observables such as the co - to - hcn or co - to - hco+ ratio , which will trace the fraction of dense molecular gas , the ratio of @xmath304co - to-@xmath0co , tracing the optical depth of the gas , and the ratio of co rotational transitions , which trace a complex combination of density , temperature , and deviation from local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "an immediate complication from such variations is that changes in internal conditions propagate to @xmath13 variations that are distinct from the dust - shielding effects accounted in our adopted conversion factors ( e.g. , see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "a second , weak prediction would be a general increase in @xmath10 with increasing molecular fraction , at least up to a certain extent  starbursts exhibit both low @xmath10 and high molecular fractions .",
    "systematic trends in @xmath10 with molecular fraction were not immediately clear in l08 ; we search for them in our present data set in the next section .",
    "a similar mixed picture arises from dynamical effects : one might expect to see high molecular fractions but low efficiencies in regions where shear or streaming motions suppress bound cloud formation .",
    "however , @xcite found little or no evidence for @xmath10 variations between spiral arms and the surrounding material .",
    "again , a similar case of competing effects comes into play , given that spiral arms are also invoked as a mechanism to collect inefficient , low @xmath10 gas into bound , high efficiency objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "though competing effects cloud a simple interpretation of the data , the path forward here remains relatively clear : systematic measurements of the internal conditions in the molecular gas represent a critical next step and our knowledge of the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor must improve to further refine our understanding of how @xmath10 depends on physical conditions . more immediately ,",

    "the figure shows results calculated using the `` @xmath71 '' @xmath340 , which removes a significant internal gradient in @xmath10 from ngc  5457 . for comparison",

    "figure [ fig : scatter ] shows a steady increase in scatter with improving linear resolution .",
    "we characterize this scale dependence of the scatter via a power law ,    @xmath341    where @xmath334 represents the spatial resolution , @xmath342 is the scatter in @xmath10 at 600  pc resolution and the power - law index @xmath343 measures the rate at which changing the resolution changes the measured scatter in @xmath10 .",
    "we report the best - fit @xmath343 for each multiscale target in table [ tab : scaledep ] .",
    "as described above , we expect @xmath344 for uncorrelated star formation in a disk .    in most cases",
    "the best - fit averaging index , @xmath343 , is @xmath229 , significantly less than the @xmath344 expected for uncorrelated , fixed - efficiency star formation .",
    "based on the previous sections , we expect that this reflect real @xmath10 variations or correlated systematic uncertainties in our physical parameter estimation ( e.g. , undiagnosed @xmath13 variations ) .",
    "that is , this is another way to see the subtle but real systematic variations in @xmath10 considered in the last two sections .",
    "alternatively , figure [ fig : scatter ] and table [ tab : scaledep ] could reflect a high degree of synchronization , with adjacent regions likely to be at the same stage of the star formation process and thus show similar ratios of star formation tracers to co emission . either synchronization or real @xmath10 variations might be achieved by dynamical phenomena at small scales and systematic efficiency variations may arise from dependence on local conditions that we have yet to identify .",
    "this weak , @xmath345 , scale dependence agrees with predictions based on numerical simulations by @xcite , who discuss @xmath343 in terms of dimensionality . as an example , @xmath346 would be consistent with the degree of correlation expected by spiral arms or any other phenomenon that synchronizes star formation along one dimension , though in the simulations of @xcite it arises more generally .",
    "the low @xmath343 also agrees qualitatively with numerous observations of highly structured star formation on scales @xmath347  kpc in nearby galaxies ; for example , see the recent synthesis by @xcite .    from the perspective of galactic - scale star formation ,",
    "the key point from this calculation is that the scatter in @xmath10 at kpc scales depends on processes operating at scales larger than that of individual star - forming regions .",
    "that is , key information on the distribution of star formation in galaxies remains to be extracted from comparison of maps of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "this represents another manifestation of the overall theme of this section , that real second order variations in @xmath10 do appear visible in our sample .",
    "future investigation of heracles and similar surveys will allow tests of the degree to which this correlation can be attributed to systematic variations in @xmath10 as a function of yet - unexplored local conditions or to physical parameter estimation .",
    "simultaneously , observations with high spatial dynamic range will allow more a detailed diagnosis of the scale - dependence of @xmath10 .",
    "our sample does not contain any true galaxy - wide starbursts , but many of our targets do host nuclear concentrations of star formation and gas @xcite , so that the inner kpc of our targets represents a subsample intermediate between normal disk galaxies and starbursts .",
    "these regions represent only a small fraction of the area in our targets , so exert a negligible impact on the ensemble of data seen in figure [ fig : combined ] but they probe an important part of parameter space  high @xmath1 , high @xmath2  and so we explicitly consider them in figure [ fig : tdep_center ] .",
    "we plot the enhancement in @xmath10 , calculated by dividing @xmath10 for each point by the average for that galaxy , and mark points from the inner kpc of our targets with large symbols : blue dots for galaxies with some spectroscopic indication of an agn ( * ? ? ? * or ned ) and",
    "green stars show star - formation dominated regions .    the top left panel of figure [ fig : tdep_center ] shows enhancement in @xmath10 for a fixed @xmath13 .",
    "we find systematically lower @xmath10 in the centers of our targets , both agn and starbursts .",
    "we find this shorter @xmath10 using a fixed @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite find evidence for systematically lower conversion factors in the central parts of our sample .",
    "the top right panel of figure [ fig : tdep_center ] shows the results of applying these central corrections , as part of our `` @xmath71 '' conversion factor . @xmath10",
    "become even shorter in the central regions compared to the disks .",
    "figure [ fig : tdep_center ] thus exhibits one of the clearest systematic effects in our sample : the central regions of our targets tend to have significantly shorter @xmath10 than the ensemble of disk regions .",
    "central @xmath10 are @xmath231 times the disk value with @xmath348  dex ( @xmath6 scatter ) for fixed @xmath13 .",
    "the median central - to - disk ratio drops to @xmath349 with @xmath350  dex scatter our `` @xmath71'' case .",
    "this apparently real shortening of @xmath10 coincides with an increase in the co(2 - 1 ) to co(1 - 0 ) ratio , indicative of more excited gas .",
    "the bottom right panel shows that this lower @xmath10 coincides with higher co(2 - 1 ) to co(1 - 0 ) ratios ( calculated with comparison to * ? ? ?",
    "the central regions of our targets show systematically enhanced co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) compared to the disks .",
    "this excitement presumably reflects the same changing physical conditions that drive the lower conversion factors found by @xcite , underscoring that nuclear gas concentrations represent a distinct physical regime from galaxy disks .",
    "molecular gas in these regions gives off more co emission , appears more excited , and forms stars more rapidly than molecular gas further out in the disks of galaxies .",
    "not all nuclear regions exhibit shorter @xmath10 .",
    "a sufficient but not necessary condition to find such enhancements in our data is : ( 1 ) to lie within the central kpc of a target and ( 2 ) have co(2 - 1 ) intensity @xmath351  k  kms@xmath38 .",
    "we indicate this criteria using a red line in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : tdep_center ] .",
    "this does not precisely equate to a @xmath1 threshold because of ambiguities introduced by @xmath13 ; the figure shows that central parts of galaxies with bright co emission tend to show lower @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue for multiple `` modes '' or `` sequences '' of star formation , in which the shorter dynamical time and higher density in starburst galaxies lead to shorter depletion times at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig : tdep_center ] supports this idea inasmuch as it shows that physical conditions other than gas surface density play an important role determining @xmath10 .",
    "the population of low @xmath10 in figure [ fig : tdep_center ] appear to be set by factors other than kpc - scale @xmath1 alone : first , identifying these lines of sight requires knowing that the points line in the centers of our targets ; second , @xmath10 exhibits a wide range , presumably set by other physical parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : tdep_center ] does not support the idea of two cleanly distinguished sequences , suggesting instead that a continuum of @xmath10 exist in the central regions of our targets ; we plot the histogram of central @xmath10 in section [ sec : summary ] .    what drives these enhancements ?",
    "beam dilution certainly plays some role .",
    "our kpc resolution will average out nuclear gas concentrations with surface densities well in excess of the disks of our targets but small spatial extent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we expect that high pressure , driven by the deep potential well in the central parts of galaxies , also plays a role driving gas to higher densities .",
    "this effect is seen in our own galaxy @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that the shorter dynamical timescales in starburst galaxies may also play a key role and our data may offer some tentative support for this ( figure [ fig : tdep_local_corr ] ) . for this paper ,",
    "the key result is that the shorter @xmath10 do exist , so that the inner parts of disk galaxies represent a kind of `` transition regime '' between the disks of spirals and galaxy - wide starbursts .",
    "follow - up interferometry and spectroscopy contrasting physical conditions in the nuclear regions with those in disks will yield more insight .",
    "we study the relationship between molecular gas surface density , @xmath1 , as traced by co ( 2 - 1 ) emission and sfr surface density ,  traced by combinations of h@xmath352 , fuv , and ir emission  at 1  kpc resolution across the optical disks of 30 nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "broadly , we demonstrate two conclusions , which we illustrate using histograms of @xmath10 in figure [ fig : histogram ] : a first - order simple correspondence between @xmath1 and @xmath2 and second - order systematic variations in the apparent molecular gas depletion time , @xmath10 , including lower values in nuclear starbursts and low , mass low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "some , but not all , of these variations may be explained by invoking a dependence of the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor , @xmath13 , on dust - to - gas ratio    first , molecular gas and star formation are tightly correlated in both individual galaxies and over individual kpc - resolution lines of sight . their ratio , the molecular gas depletion time , @xmath10 appears to first - order constant across the disks of massive , large star - forming galaxies , with a median value @xmath353  gyr , a scatter of @xmath58 dex , and systematic uncertainty @xmath354 ( see the nearly lognormal histogram in the left panels of figure [ fig : histogram ] ) .",
    "we arrive at this conclusion testing a wide range of methodologies to trace the recent star formation rate and distribution of molecular gas .",
    "this includes the interchange of h@xmath31 and fuv emission , varying treatments of the infrared `` cirrus '' , substitution of literature co ( 1 - 0 ) for our co ( 2 - 1 ) maps , and adoption of variable co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factors .",
    "we demonstrate that our measurements agree with a large collection of literature data from the last decade ( section [ sec : lit ] ) , with all data occupying a common region of @xmath1-@xmath355 parameter space .",
    "our data reinforce and extend a consensus for a `` large disk galaxy '' value of @xmath356  gyr for matched assumptions about the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor and stellar imf with @xmath58  dex scatter .    adopting a forward - modeling approach similar to that of @xcite",
    ", we derive a best - fit power law index of @xmath357 for @xmath358 ( section [ sec : index ] ) for a fixed @xmath13 and show that individual galaxies exhibit a distribution of @xmath7 with @xmath7 mostly in the range 0.81.2 .",
    "however , we stress the inadequacy of a power law to capture important changes in physical conditions other than @xmath1 and the substantial uncertainty in such fits . reinforcing the conclusions of @xcite",
    ", we caution that the commonly used combination of  sigma - clipping \" and bivariate fitting has the potential to substantially bias results ( see appendix ) , yielding seemingly discordant values of @xmath7 even when the data substantially agree .",
    "our second major conclusion is that with a broad sample spanning a wide range of physical conditions , systematic variations in the apparent @xmath10 emerge both among and within galaxies ( see the width of the distribution in the top middle panel of figure [ fig : histogram ] ) .",
    "we show systematic variations of galaxy - average apparent @xmath10 as a function of many host galaxy properties : stellar mass , rotation velocity , metallicity , dust - to - gas ratio , average gas surface density , and morphology .",
    "these variations have the sense that low mass , low metallicity , late type galaxies exhibit shorter apparent @xmath10 than high mass galaxies .",
    "the trends persist , though weaker , even into the high mass region , @xmath129  m@xmath47 , and agree well with those seen in the coldgass sample @xcite .",
    "we emphasize `` apparent '' because these variations appear to be a mixture of real changes in the rate at which gas forms stars and biases in physical parameter estimation .",
    "adopting a co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor that depends on the dust - to - gas ratio can explain many of the strongest variations with host galaxy properties ; note the narrowing from the top middle panel of figure [ fig : histogram ] to the bottom middle panel .",
    "our ability to examine residual trends remains restricted by the limited precision with which we know @xmath13 , but our best estimate is that correlations do remain between the real ( @xmath13-adjusted ) @xmath10 and galaxy mass , average gas surface density , and perhaps several other quantities .",
    "we also examine how @xmath10 varies as a function of local conditions .",
    "we find two strong relationships : the apparent @xmath10 calculated for a fixed @xmath13 varies systematically as a function of dust - to - gas ratio and we observe systematically lower and widely varying @xmath10 in the inner kpc of our targets ( see the top right panel of figure [ fig : histogram ] .",
    "we interpret the first as indicating important variations in @xmath13 and , as with the galaxy - integrated case , show that application of a dust - to - gas ratio dependent @xmath13 can explain much of the observed trend .",
    "the lower @xmath10 in galaxy centers appears real and robust to @xmath13 considerations .",
    "indeed , @xcite find low @xmath13 in the central parts of many of our targets , which implies even lower @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting @xmath10 in the inner parts of galaxies varies widely ( see the right panels in figure [ fig : histogram ] ) , providing strong evidence that environmental factors do drive @xmath10 , and thus the star formation rate , in these regions .",
    "strong local trends beyond those linking @xmath10 to the dust - to - gas ratio and nuclear starbursts elude our present analysis , though the correlation of @xmath10 with integrated properties and weak dependence of scatter on scale strongly suggest their presence . we suspect that the limited resolution and remaining imprecision in physical parameter estimation so far obscure these trends in heracles .",
    "comparison to existing _",
    "herschel _ data and spectroscopy of other molecular lines should improve our ability to understand the origins of the physical scatter in @xmath10 .",
    "perhaps just as important , at kpc resolution significant averaging has already occurred , especially in regions of high @xmath2 .",
    "the star - forming ism hosts many competing effects : for example , shear may both suppress collapse and lead to more frequent cloud collisions ; high pressures may lead to both denser clouds and a substantial diffuse molecular ism ; spiral arms may both collect material and suppress collapse via streaming motions . at our kpc resolution",
    ", such trends will be subtle as competing effects occur inside a single resolution element . in the longer term",
    ", higher resolution observations of a diverse sample of galaxies will be needed to diagnose the impact of dynamical effects on star formation .",
    "these results fit into a broad picture of star formation in galaxies as follows . within the disks of nearby galaxies",
    ", we find recent star formation correlated with molecular , rather than atomic or total , gas @xcite .",
    "the ratio of co emission to recent star formation appears roughly constant within massive , star - forming disk galaxies ( section [ sec : scaling ] * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but when examined more closely , significant variations do emerge between this ratio and galaxy mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section [ sec : tdep_vary ] ) and dust - to - gas ratio or metallicity ( section [ sec : tdep_vary ] ) .",
    "the interpretation of these trends depends critically on the behavior of the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor .",
    "we show that current best estimates may explain many of the observed trends in the co - to - sfr ratio ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we caution that significant work is still needed to bring conversion factor estimates to the precision needed to confidently interpret these trends .",
    "our best estimate is that correlations in which the true molecular gas depletion time , @xmath10 , increases with increasing galaxy mass or gas surface density do persist after accounting for @xmath13 effects , but that these are comparatively weak .",
    "a sensible explanation for such trends is the emergence of a diffuse , unbound molecular medium at high gas surface densities and high pressures , but direct evidence relating a local high molecular fraction to lower @xmath10 is weak in our present data set .",
    "we do find good evidence for systematically low @xmath10 in galaxy centers , with a wide variation in the factor by which @xmath10 falls below the average for that disk .",
    "this supports the idea that in environments with high surface densities and short dynamical or orbital times , environmental factors may drive @xmath10 to a wide range of values at fixed average gas surface density .",
    "this is a more general formulation than the idea of distinct `` disk '' and `` starburst '' sequences , but qualitatively agrees with the picture from @xcite and @xcite , with the nuclei of disk galaxies occupying a regime intermediate between quiescent disks and merger - induced starbursts .",

    "we then carry out an ols bisector fit to the data and record the best - fit power law index .",

    "we find that for commonly used thresholds ( @xmath390@xmath37  m@xmath47  pc@xmath48 ) and typical observed scatters ( @xmath391  dex ) a significant bias can be introduced to the best fit index , often shifting it from its true value of @xmath392 ( by construction ) to @xmath393 or @xmath394 .",
    "note that figure [ fig : fitbias ] illustrates the problem but that the exact magnitude of the bias will depend on the dynamic range , noise , and underlying relationship in the data set studied .",

    "clipping based on both @xmath2 and @xmath1 may lead to offsetting biases but does not represent a proper substitute for a rigorous treatment .",
    "finally , we emphasize that although we do clip data below @xmath395  m@xmath47  pc@xmath48 in our fitting ( section [ sec : index ] ) the bias describe here will not affect our results because we model the data distribution rather than carry out a bivariate fit .",
