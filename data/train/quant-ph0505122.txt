    "recently , a scheme of quantum computation using the rotation - invariant measurement of the total ` spin ' of two qubits as the only gate has been devised @xcite .",

    "i describe a scheme for universal quantum computation via translation - invariant operations on a chain of qubits .",
    "no individual addressability is required .",
    "the scheme uses an ising - type interaction and spatially uniform one - qubit gates .",
    "the qubits are all of the same species .",
    "cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , where the requirement of local control adds to the overall technological challenge , are a candidate for the realization of the presented scheme .",
    "consider a one - dimensional chain of @xmath0 qubits initialized in the state @xmath1 which is repetitively updated according to the transition function @xmath2 that is , in each elementary step of the evolution first a hadamard gate is applied to each qubit and second , conditional phase gates are simultaneously applied to all pairs of neighboring qubits .",
