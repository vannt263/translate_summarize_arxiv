    "exploring galaxy formation and evolution is one of the most important issues in modern astronomy . the structure formation model suggesting that more massive objects in the universe were rapidly assembled , and star formation activities were completed in an early epoch is known as `` downsizing '' ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) ; however , it is not clear when and how the specific precesses in this evolutionary model occurred .",
    "the physical processes between baryons in the dark matter halo are so complex that it is not known how the luminous objects that we are able to observe directly were formed in the highly dense dark matter halo .    to approach these issues , it is important to determine properties of galaxies , including the dark halo mass , the stellar mass , the star - formation rate ( sfr ) , and the morphology over cosmic time , and to compare these quantities with theoretical models .",
    "the dark halo mass of galaxies is a particularly important parameter to trace the mass assembly history of galaxies because , according to the @xmath12cdm model , dark haloes grow monotonically with cosmic time by merging , irrespective of the baryon processes .",
    "however , measuring the mass of the dark halo is not straightforward .",
    "one of the most effective methods to determine the mass of dark haloes is to use the galaxy clustering strength .",
    "various studies have revealed the dark halo mass in the distant universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) ; however , this method requires a large number of samples in order to measure the clustering strength of galaxies , which has been a problem for @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the distinctive spectral features of galaxies at @xmath0 are red - shifted from optical wavelengths to near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "wide - field nir observation using ground - based telescopes is complicated because of the limited physical size of the nir detectors and ( with the exception of some atmospheric windows ) poor sky transparency , as well as strong oh airglow emission lines and thermal emission .",
    "for this reason , wide - field galaxy survey data are lacking at @xmath0 ( this commonly referred to as the `` redshift desert '' ) .",
    "recent observations have shown that @xmath0 is an important era in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "for example , star formation in galaxies peaked at @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , galaxy mass rapidly assembled at @xmath14 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and the number density of qsos peaked at @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a powerful method to select unbiased data with high completeness @xmath0 galaxies has been proposed , namely the `` bzk selection '' technique @xcite .",
    "the bzk selection method requires only @xmath15- , @xmath16- , and @xmath3-band photometric data , and enables us to select both star - forming bzks ( hereafter sbzks ) and passively evolving bzks ( hereafter pbzks ) simultaneously in a single colour  colour diagram .",
    "however , a precise clustering analysis of bzk galaxies requires a large number of galaxy samples and has not yet been performed due to the difficulties in obtaining wide - field @xmath3-band imaging data .",
    "a number of studies have attempted to reveal the clustering properties of bzk galaxies .",
    "@xcite constructed bzk galaxy samples over 1200 arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "they conducted the clustering analysis of sbzks and pbzks and concluded that pbzks are more strongly clustered than sbzks , suggesting that the morphology  density relation seen in the local universe must already have been in place at @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite carried out a deep bzk galaxy survey in the subaru deep field to investigate the properties of faint sbzks and reported that the clustering strength of sbzks depends on the @xmath3-band luminosity .",
    "@xcite succeeded in constructing a large number of bzk galaxy samples in the cosmos field over 1.9 deg@xmath4 down to @xmath17 and carried out a precise clustering analysis . wide survey area and",
    "multiwavelength data from the cosmos survey enabled them to determine the comoving correlation length for both sbzks and pbzks , respectively .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported the clustering properties of @xmath0 galaxies by splitting the galaxy samples into star - forming galaxies and passive galaxies based on the photometric redshift and galaxy colour .",
    "they revealed that passive galaxies are more strongly clustered than are star - forming galaxies ; however , very massive star - forming galaxies ( @xmath18 ) exhibited comparable clustering strength to passive galaxies .",
    "their clustering analysis of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 was , however , confined to massive galaxies because of a shortage of galaxy samples at @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite succeeded in calculating the dark halo mass of sbzks for wide mass range @xmath19 using both galaxy clustering and hod analyses in the cosmos field .",
    "the dark halo masses determined using both methods were in good agreement and were consistent with the predictions of semi - analytic models .",
    "they calculated the dark halo mass at @xmath0 ; however , the clustering analysis used had a poor signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio , especially at the large angular scale ( @xmath20 ) , which made it difficult to determine the dark halo mass accurately .    in this paper , we report a largest - ever wide - field galaxy survey over @xmath21 deg@xmath4 down to @xmath5 using @xmath1-band data instead of @xmath15-band data ( we term our sample galaxies `` gzks '' ) and performed the clustering analysis of star - forming gzks ( hereafter sgzks ) with a significantly higher s / n ratio than has been reported previously . because of the large number of sgzk samples , we are able to divide our sgzk samples into subsamples according to the @xmath3-band luminosity , and we investigate the clustering properties of each subsample .",
    "our very wide survey area makes it possible to constrain the dark halo mass because we were able to determine an accurate angular correlation function at large angular scales , which is essential to determining the dark halo mass accurately . in this paper ( paper i )",
    ", we describe the measurement of the angular correlation function of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 based on this large sample , and the dark halo mass is determined using angular correlation functions .",
    "additionally , we carried out a halo occupation distribution ( hod ) analysis on the sgzks , and we determine the distribution of galaxies in the dark haloes for each @xmath3-band limiting magnitude , which will be described in paper ii .",
    "the framework of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give details of the data that were used as well as the method employed to construct the @xmath3-selected and sgzk catalogues .",
    "we describe the method used to correct for differences in the filter transmissions between our @xmath22 filters and the vlt-@xmath23 filters @xcite . in section 3 , we describe the method to conduct clustering analysis using the angular correlation function . taking advantage of the large number of sgzk samples ,",
    "we resample the sgzk samples into subsamples according to the @xmath3-band magnitudes to investigate the clustering properties .",
    "the results of our clustering analysis of sgzks are discussed in section 4 , and we give a conclusion in section 5 .",
    "all magnitudes and colours are in the ab system . throughout this paper , we assume flat lambda cosmology @xmath24 , @xmath25 , the hubble constant is @xmath26 , and the normalization of the matter power spectrum is @xmath27 . assuming these cosmological parameters , the age of the universe at @xmath28 is @xmath29 gyr , and 1 arcsec corresponds to 8.37@xmath30 kpc in the comoving scale",
    "we collected wide - field imaging data by using both our own data and publically available archival data .",
    "photometric data describing the @xmath3-band were obtained from the archives of the united kingdom infra - red telescope ( ukirt ) deep sky survey ( ukidss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the deep extragalactic survey ( dxs ) .",
    "the ukidss data were acquired using the wide field camera ( wfcam ) , which is composed of four @xmath31 pixel detectors , with a separation of @xmath32 between detectors .",
    "each detector covers @xmath33 of the sky at a pixel scale of @xmath34 pixel@xmath35 .",
    "the central wavelength and the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the @xmath3-band of the wfcam are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we obtained @xmath38-band photometric data during the course of another observational program @xcite using the subaru telescope / suprime - cam from june 22 to june 24 , 2009 .",
    "suprime - cam is a wide - field imaging instrument covering @xmath39 of the sky at a pixel scale of @xmath40 pixel@xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath38-filter ( @xmath41 ) is a custom - made filter that divides the sdss @xmath16-band filter at @xmath42 and their bluer one @xcite .",
    "one of our observation field `` vimos4 '' is centered on @xmath43 and covers @xmath443 deg@xmath4 @xcite . here , 3 deg@xmath4 of the vimos / dxs field was covered by @xmath45 suprime - cam field - of - views ( fovs ) .",
    "we adopted a common dithering circle pattern comprising a full cycle of dithering consisting of @xmath46 pointings .",
    "the total integration time was @xmath47 seconds per fov .",
    "the sky condition was very good , with a seeing size of @xmath48 .",
    "photometric calibration was carried out using the spectroscopic standard stars gd153 and feige110 .",
    "the data were reduced using the pipeline software package sdfred @xcite .",
    "the package includes bias subtraction , flat fielding , a correction for image distortion due to the prime focus , psf matching , sky subtraction , and mosaicking .",
    "we also retrieved @xmath16-band photometric data from the smoka data archive server @xcite to extend the survey field to 5.2 deg@xmath4 .",
    "these data satisfy the conditions that they connect continuously to our @xmath38-band field , and the limiting magnitude is comparable to our @xmath38-band data . the @xmath16-band data were obtained using the subaru telescope / suprime - cam .",
    "we retrieved @xmath1-band images , which cover the entire field where @xmath3 and @xmath49 images are available , using the canada ",
    "hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) archival data instead of using @xmath15-band .",
    "the cfhtls data were acquired using the cfht megacam , which covers @xmath50 of the sky at a pixel scale of @xmath34 pixel@xmath35 , where the central wavelength and fwhm of the @xmath1-band of megacam are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "we collected @xmath53 bands of imaging data over 3.2 deg@xmath4 and @xmath54 bands over 2.0 deg@xmath4 .",
    "the survey field of this study covers 5.2 deg@xmath4 , comprising the above two regions with different imaging datasets .",
    "@xcite showed that star - forming and passive galaxies at @xmath0 are also able to be selected using the @xmath55 and the @xmath56 colours , which is similar to bzk colour selection .",
    "they constructed sgzk and pgzk samples by modifying the original bzk colour - selection criteria and validated their criteria using the stellar population synthesis model @xcite .",
    "we applied a similar gzk selection process to our data , although colour correction from our @xmath57 data to the vlt-@xmath58 data is required , as only the @xmath38-band is available ."
