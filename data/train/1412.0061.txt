    "topologically ordered phases of matter attract a great deal of interest currently in condensed matter physics .",
    "fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states @xcite , as one of the most well - known topological states , provide examples of some of the most exotic features such as excitations with a fraction of the electron charge that obey anyonic statistics @xcite and are essential resources in topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed ) in small systems has traditionally been the central numerical technique of theoretical research of fqh states . despite its considerable success in studying some of the robust fqh states like the @xmath0 laughlin state @xcite , the largest system size that ed can reach",
    "is seriously limited by the exponential growth of the hilbert space .",
    "this weakens its capability in understanding some more complex fqh systems , for example those with non - abelian anyons and landau level mixing .",
    "therefore , new algorithms , like density - matrix - renormalization - group ( dmrg ) @xcite , were applied to fqh systems and the computable system size was increased by almost a factor of two compared with ed @xcite .",
    "very recently , it was realized that some model fqh states and their quasihole excitations have exact matrix - product - state ( mps ) representation @xcite . motivated by this , and considering that the dmrg algorithm can be apparently formulated in the mps language @xcite , here we report a mps code for finite fqh systems on the cylinder geometry , which is different from the one developed for infinite systems @xcite .",
    "we will show the structure of our code , explain how to use it to search the fqh ground states , compare the performance of our code with ed and traditional two - site dmrg algorithm , and discuss possible generalizations .",

    "the most basic part is the implementation of general tensors and @xmath1 quantum numbers .",
    "based on that , we can construct tensors that conserve @xmath1 quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "each site in the mps ( mpo ) is a special case of this kind of tensor with three ( four ) indices .",
    "then we can implement the chains of these sites , namely mps and mpo , and the contraction between them . finally , with the mpo representation of the physical hamiltonian as an input",

    "for a fqh system with @xmath3 electrons and @xmath4 flux in a single landau level on the cylinder of circumference @xmath5 ( in units of the magnetic length ) , any translational invariant two - body hamiltonian can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron on the landau level orbital @xmath9 , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 determine the range of @xmath12 .",

    "there are two choices when applying the finite state automaton method .",
    "the simplest one is to keep all @xmath17 satifying @xmath18 larger than some threshold ( for example @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the truncation of the interaction range .",
    "the bond dimension of the mpo , @xmath22 , obtained in this way is proportional to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the other choice is numerically much more efficient . for each @xmath24 , we first select all @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 larger than some threshold ( for example @xmath19 ) , and then approximate them by an exponential expansion @xmath25 , with an error @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are real @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 matrices , respectively , whose optimal values can be found by the state space representation method in the control theory @xcite .",
    "this exponential expansion of @xmath17 can reduce the bond dimension of mpo by a factor of two compared with the first choice and is especially suitable for long - range interactions @xcite .",

    "after improving the quality of the mpo representation ( reduce @xmath48 ) and increase the accuracy of the density matrix truncation ( reduce @xmath39 ) , we find the difference between mps and ed results essentially disappears , as shown in fig .",

    "we now apply our mps code to systems at @xmath0 with sizes beyond the ed limit . again",
    ", we choose the interaction between electrons as @xmath43 pseudopotential , so the ground state in the @xmath45 sector is the exact laughlin state with exactly zero ground energy .    in fig .",
    "[ mps ] , we fix the accuracy of the mpo ( @xmath21 and @xmath48 ) and the density matrix truncation ( @xmath39 ) , and study the convergence of the ground energy on various square samples with @xmath49 .",

    "the number of kept states in the density matrix truncation is controlled by @xmath39 and changes during the sweeps .",
    "this is a little different from the usual dmrg algorithm where a fixed number of kept states is usually set at the beginning .",
    "however , in our mps code , we can still track the number of kept states in each sweep and select the maximal one , which is also shown in fig .  [ mps ] . with the increase of the system size from @xmath50 electrons to @xmath51 electrons , the entanglement in the system grows due to the increase of circumference @xmath5 .",
    "thus the computational cost of the mps simulation also increases , reflected by the fact that the maximal number of kept states grows by a factor of @xmath52 .",

    "when the interaction goes beyond the pure @xmath43 pseudopotential , the ground state at @xmath0 is no longer the exact laughlin state with exactly zero ground energy . to achieve this",

    "the strength of @xmath63 is much smaller than @xmath43 , we expect that the ground state at @xmath0 is still in the laughlin phase , although not the exact laughlin state . because @xmath63 pseudopotential is a longer - range interaction than @xmath43 pseudopotential , the bond dimension of the mpo is larger than that of pure @xmath43 pseudopotential .",
