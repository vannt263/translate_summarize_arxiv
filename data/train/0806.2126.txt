    "with the advent of a new generation of large - scale detectors of cosmic radiation , the observation of high - energy cosmic neutrinos produced in distant astrophysical sites or possibly by other , more exotic , mechanisms has become one of the major challenges of astroparticle physics . in both astrophysical and exotic models , substantial fluxes of electron and muon neutrinos are expected from the disintegration of charged pions ( and kaons ) produced in the interaction of accelerated particles with ambient matter and radiation , either at the source location or between the source and the observer . given the large distances traveled by these cosmic neutrinos , approximately equal fluxes in @xmath2 and @xmath1 are expected on earth as a result of flavor mixing and oscillations  @xcite .",
    "important efforts are ongoing to build dedicated neutrino telescopes both in the southern  @xcite and northern  @xcite hemisphere , opening a window on the neutrino sky in the energy range @xmath3 . at even higher energies",
    ", other promising experiments are developing the detection of coherent radio emission produced by neutrino - induced showers in matter  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent studies have shown that the new generation of ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) cosmic ray detectors such as the pierre auger observatory  @xcite and the hires fly s eye detector  @xcite have a comparable detection potential for uhe neutrinos in the range of energies @xmath4 , where neutrinos are expected to be produced in the interaction of uhe cosmic rays with the cosmic microwave background  @xcite .",
    "it is long known that downward - going showers induced by neutrinos that penetrate deep in the atmosphere can in principle be identified at large zenith angles ( @xmath5 ) where no background is expected from hadronic primaries  @xcite .",
    "it was also pointed out more recently that the presence of @xmath1 in the cosmic neutrino flux provides another promising channel of detection for air shower detectors  @xcite .",
    "upward - going uhe tau neutrinos that graze the earth just below the horizon ( often referred to as `` earth - skimming neutrinos '' ) are indeed likely to interact in the crust and produce a tau lepton which may emerge and initiate an observable air shower , provided it does not decay too far from the detector .",
    "the sensitivity to such uhe earth - skimming neutrinos crucially depends on the conditions of the @xmath1 propagation through the terrestrial crust , and on the correct estimation of the flux of @xmath6 leptons that emerge from the earth .",
    "this propagation problem has been widely discussed in different contexts and with different approximations  @xcite .",
    "an exhaustive treatment should account for @xmath6 and @xmath1 neutral - current ( nc ) and charged - current ( cc ) interactions with nucleons , @xmath6 decay and energy losses .",
    "however the full coupled transport equations admit no analytical solution , and even in the case of monte carlo calculations , simplifications are usually made such as dropping the @xmath6 weak interactions and neglecting multiple regenerations of the @xmath1 .",
    "such approximations are defendable in the standard case where the characteristic lengths for the @xmath6 cc interaction ( @xmath7 km , at 1 eev ) and for the @xmath6 decay ( @xmath8 km ) are larger than that for energy losses ( @xmath9 km ) .",
    "however , they might be challenged in other , more exotic scenarios .",
    "the knowledge of the neutrino cross section and the tau energy losses in the eev energy range is indeed limited  @xcite , and these could be significantly affected at center - of - mass energies beyond the tev by the onset of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "several studies have even suggested that the comparison of the flux rates between down - going and earth - skimming neutrinos could actually help constraining the neutrino properties at ultrahigh energies , where no direct measurements exist  @xcite .",
    "all these considerations pinpoint the necessity of an accurate determination of the flux of emerging @xmath6 leptons . in this context",
    ", it is important to correctly describe all the contributions to the @xmath6 flux and to assess the impact of simplifications in the description of the propagation problem .",
    "the present paper therefore focuses on understanding the effects of the @xmath1 and @xmath6 regeneration while skimming the earth on the flux of emerging @xmath6 leptons in different scenarios for the neutrino - nucleon cross section and for the @xmath6 energy losses . in sec . [",
    "sec : calcul ] , we present the transport equations for the @xmath10 and @xmath6 propagation , and the scenarios to be studied . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we compare the flux of emerging taus for different conditions of propagation . finally , we present our conclusions in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the geometry of the propagation problem is described in fig.[fig : simul ] , where an example of regeneration chain through multiple cc interactions and @xmath6 decays is sketched . given a beam of parallel neutrinos incident on the earth at a given angle @xmath11 , the problem becomes unidimensional and the flux of @xmath6 leptons that emerge only depends on the path length traveled across the rock . in the hypothesis of a spherical earth with a crust of constant density ,",
    "this length is directly related to @xmath11 , which is also the angle of the emerging tau .",
    "we reproduce here a classical formulation in terms of the transport equations that describe the evolution of the @xmath1 and @xmath6 fluxes , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , along their path through the earth , accounting for all possible production and absorption processes taking place within an infinitesimal @xmath14 :    @xmath15    here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the mean free paths corresponding respectively to nc and cc interactions of the incident @xmath1 , while @xmath18 corresponds to the @xmath6 cc interaction , which regenerates a @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath19 is the tau lepton lifetime .",
    "the transport equation for the @xmath6 can be inferred in a similar way . in this case",
    ", the small inelasticity of the @xmath6 radiative interactions allows us to use the continuous energy loss approximation @xcite . defining @xmath20 ,",
    "the equation reads : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are now the mean free paths associated with the @xmath6 nc and cc interactions , and @xmath24 is the decay length corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "we are thus left with a system of two coupled , integro - differential equations , which can not be solved analytically without making simplifying assumptions on the nature and the respective importance of the interactions that both the @xmath1 and the @xmath6 can undergo . to preserve the generality of the solution we use a monte carlo simulation that includes all the processes listed above and follows the incident particle all the way through the rock , deciding at each step on its fate according to the distributions encoded in eq.[eq : phinutau ] and eq.[eq : phitau ] .",
    "an iterative method that also allows us to avoid simplifications was proposed in  @xcite , and further discussed in  @xcite and in  @xcite .",
    "our equations differ from those in  @xcite in that we also include the two terms describing @xmath6 nc interactions in the transport equation for @xmath13 . taking into account this generalization ,",
    "we have applied the iterative method ( see the appendix for details ) to crosscheck the results from the monte carlo simulation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcvsana ] , we show the good agreement between both calculations for the flux of emerging @xmath6 leptons given an incident tau neutrino flux @xmath26 = 4.6@xmath2710@xmath28 e@xmath29  eev@xmath30  sr@xmath30 .",
    "in the framework of the standard model , the neutrino - nucleon ( @xmath31 ) cc and nc cross - sections , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , describe deep - inelastic scattering processes .",
    "they are expressed in terms of the structure functions of the nucleon , which in turn depend on the individual parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the pdfs are obtained from measurements at accelerators , in determinate ranges of bjorken-@xmath34 and momentum transfer @xmath35 .",
    "however , the range of parameters probed by the uhe neutrinos , @xmath36 and @xmath35 up to @xmath37 , is outside the measured domain and therefore extrapolations are needed .",
    "we choose as a benchmark for the _ standard _",
    "@xmath31 cross section a recent parametrization presented in  @xcite , which fits to updated hera data :    @xmath38    as pointed out in the same paper , another , more speculative approach based on the color glass condensate formalism  @xcite has also been put forward recently to account for saturation at very low @xmath34 .",
    "we will also consider this case and use the following approximate parametrization deduced from fig . 1 of  @xcite : @xmath39 as an example of _ low _",
    "@xmath31 cross section .",
    "on the other hand , plenty of models using new physics predict an enhancement of the neutrino cross section  @xcite . as an example of _ high _ @xmath31 cross section",
    ", we will use @xmath40 without assuming any particular model .",
    "the @xmath6 energy losses are usually parametrized using the following formula : @xmath41 where @xmath11 is practically constant and accounts for ionization processes , while @xmath42 includes the radiative contributions from bremsstrahlung ( b ) , pair production ( pp ) and photonuclear ( pn ) interactions of the @xmath6 .    for the purpose of our analysis",
    ", we adopt the same strategy as in the previous section and extract from existing computations  @xcite a panel of ad - hoc parametrizations of @xmath42 in the relevant range of energy , representative of the values found in the literature .",
    "the set of parametrizations under study is the following ( valid in the range @xmath43 eev @xmath44 eev ) : @xmath45\\ { \\it high } : % \\end{itemize } \\beta_{high}(e_\\tau ) & = & 1.36\\ \\left(\\frac{e_\\tau}{\\text{eev}}\\right)^{0.35}\\ 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{g}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^2\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nonumber\\\\ % \\begin{itemize } % \\item[case]\\ { \\it low } : % \\end{itemize } \\beta_{low}(e_\\tau ) & = & \\left(0.3 + 0.06\\times \\log_{10}(\\frac{e_\\tau}{\\text{eev}})\\right)\\ 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{g}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^2\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively for a standard , a high and a low value of the energy loss parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the earth - skimming technique has been recently used to search for @xmath47 with the hires telescopes  @xcite and the pierre auger observatory  @xcite . while both detectors have a similar energy threshold ( @xmath48 0.1 eev ) , they are sensitive to a different range in the emerging angle @xmath11 of the @xmath6 leptons .",
    "the latter detects the particles from the air shower initiated by the @xmath6 decay that reach the ground and , hence , the detector will only be triggered by @xmath6 leptons slightly up - going ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the former is designed to record the faint ultraviolet light emitted by nitrogen molecules that are excited as the shower traverses the atmosphere ; it is therefore sensitive to @xmath6 leptons emerging with larger angles .    in figure",
    "[ fig : stde2_15reg ] , we present the results obtained with the monte carlo approach for the flux of emerging @xmath6 leptons with an angle @xmath11 up to 3@xmath50 and 15@xmath50 produced by an incident tau neutrino flux @xmath26 = 4.6  10@xmath51  eev@xmath30  sr@xmath30 .",
    "all cross sections and energy loss parameters are here set to _ standard",
    "_ values , as defined in secs .",
    "[ subsec : xs ] and  [ subsec : elosses ] .",
    "the effect of the regeneration is negligible if only almost horizontal emerging @xmath6 leptons ( @xmath52 ) are taken into account . on the other hand , if the detector is sensitive to larger angles and energies down to a fraction of eev , neglecting the regeneration becomes important already within this _ standard _ picture ( 30@xmath53 less @xmath6 leptons at 0.3 eev for an incident neutrino flux @xmath54 ) .",
    "the approximation of neglecting the regeneration seems thus to be safe in the standard picture for detectors only sensitive to almost horizontal showers .",
    "however , we will now show that this approximation is questionable even for them as soon as one considers non-_standard _ scenarios .",
    "we have investigated the effect of the regeneration for those detectors using the set of parametrizations defined in secs .",
    "[ subsec : xs ] and  [ subsec : elosses ] .",
    "these expressions do not constitute an exhaustive list of all the alternative and exotic models that exist in the literature , but rather a selection of a few examples that allow us to point out the relevance of this process .",
    "the combinations of cross sections and tau energy losses should be chosen on basis of coherent pdfs but this coherency is hard to assert even inside the frame of the standard model .",
    "therefore , we chose to investigate the regeneration effects for the 3@xmath553 possible combinations , which is sufficient to provide a qualitative answer to the question raised in this paper .",
    "as a starting point , one should however notice that the regeneration requires the @xmath6 to be converted back into a @xmath1 before losing too much energy , and then this @xmath1 to undergo another cc weak interaction to produce a @xmath6 again .",
    "hence , one expects that a higher energy loss or a lower cross section will reduce the effect of the regeneration , while , on the other hand , a higher cross section or a lower energy loss will enhance it .",
    "this is indeed what we find . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the particular combinations for which the regeneration is not negligible anymore , and compare them to the standard case , essentially on the basis of monoenergetic incident beams of @xmath1 s .",
    "this is because the @xmath56 power - law spectrum usually assumed for cosmic neutrinos , although adequate to look at the global flux of emerging @xmath6 leptons , is completely dominated by the lowest energies , while the behavior at the highest energies may be important for harder fluxes of incident neutrinos .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : stdstdtau]-[fig : lowhightau ] , we show the flux of @xmath6 leptons produced by incident neutrinos at given energies ( 0.3 , 3 and 30 eev ) and with an angle @xmath11 up to 3@xmath50 , for the following combinations of parametrizations : @xmath57 ( the same as used in fig .  [ fig : stde2_15reg ] ) , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for a _ standard _ choice of parametrizations",
    ", one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : stdstdtau ] that the impact of regeneration is completely negligible at low neutrino energies . as the @xmath1 energy increases , however , the lowest - energy part of the @xmath6 spectrum starts to be significantly underestimated ( 15@xmath53 less taus for 30 eev incident neutrinos ) .",
    "this effect is washed out in the case of an incident neutrino flux @xmath61 , for which the contribution of the highest - energy part of the neutrino spectrum is negligible ; but it could affect the spectrum of emerging @xmath6 s if the neutrino flux were harder . for the other cases , the lowest - energy range of the @xmath6 spectrum becomes underestimated already for incident @xmath47 with energy of 0.3 eev .",
    "for the combination @xmath60 , one loses about 70@xmath53 of the @xmath6 leptons emerging from the earth if the regeneration is neglected , even if assuming an incident flux of neutrinos @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hle2_3degreg ] ) .",
    "the neutrino flux can be regenerated through the @xmath6 decay and the @xmath6 cc weak interaction .",
    "we present our results in a form that allows us to disentangle the two effects : the dotted histograms in fig .  [",
    "fig : stdstdtau],[fig : stdhightau],[fig : lowstdtau],[fig : lowhightau ] account for regeneration through the weak interaction of the @xmath6 only , while the solid ones include both effects .",
    "as can be appreciated in the figures , the cc contribution is negligible at all energies in most scenarios .",
    "it only becomes important for @xmath1 s at the highest energies ( @xmath62 eev ) , in the energy range between 0.3 and 3.0 eev of the emerging @xmath6 spectrum , if a _",
    "high _ cross section is assumed ( figs .",
    "[ fig : stdhightau ] and [ fig : lowhightau ] ) .",
    "there , the effect is at the level of that from the regeneration through the @xmath6 decay .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the mechanism of regeneration of the @xmath1 flux while crossing the earth , to investigate its effect on the flux of emerging @xmath6 leptons . assuming a detector with an energy threshold of 0.1 eev and sensitive only to taus with an emerging angle below 3@xmath50 , the effect is negligible for a flux of incident neutrinos @xmath54 with the standard values of cross sections and energy losses .",
    "but we have shown that this is not valid for other assumptions on the detector performance , neither for less standard values of the weak cross section or tau energy losses .",
    "on the one hand , neglecting the regeneration leads to about 30@xmath53 underestimation on the integrated flux for a detector sensitive up to 15@xmath50 . on the other hand , the underestimation of the @xmath6 s emerging from the earth with an energy greater than 0.1 eev and an emerging angle below 3@xmath50 may reach 70@xmath53 for the different values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 studied in this paper .",
    "moreover , the error made in the computation of the flux of emerging taus can be even larger for a harder flux of incident neutrinos since the contribution of the regeneration effect increases with the energy of the incident neutrino .",
    "the simplification of neglecting the regeneration is thus only safe for particular values of the physical properties playing a role on the propagation and specific detectors .",
    "it may lead to a significant underestimation of the flux of emerging @xmath6 s when looking at nonstandard values of the weak cross section or tau energy losses .",
    "therefore , it should be carefully treated and accounted for when studying the systematics due to the uncertainties on those properties or while using the earth - skimming technique to test for instance higher weak cross - sections .",
    "similarly , one should carefully check the effect for the characteristics of the actual detector before neglecting the regeneration .",

    "we reproduce here a numerical method proposed in @xcite , generalizing it to take into account the nc weak interaction of the @xmath6 lepton .",
    "we start from a solution of order 0 and iterate it up to get a solution that satisfies the relation @xmath66 as given by eq .",
    "[ eq : phinutau ] or  [ eq : phitau ] . for numerical reasons ,",
    "it is better to work with numbers between 0 and 1 so that we write the equations in terms of the deviation to the solution of order 0 , @xmath67 , rather than in terms of @xmath12 itself .",

    "as the two equations are coupled , it is necessary to know @xmath13 at a given order to proceed with the iteration at the next order .",
