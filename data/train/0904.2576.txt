    "the _ @xmath3-tour cover problem _ ( @xmath3-tc ) , is a very natural and well known generalization of the traveling salesperson problem ( tsp ) to include several tours @xcite .",

    "a tour is a cycle whose vertices are in @xmath10 .",
    "the length of a tour is the sum of distances between the adjacent points on the tour .",
    "the objective is to find a set of tours , each including the origin and at most @xmath3 points in @xmath0 , which covers all points in @xmath0 and achieves the minimum total length .    in operations research",
    ", the @xmath3-tc problem is well known as the _ capacitated vehicle routing problem _ @xcite .",
    "the name comes from its standard application when the points in @xmath0 represent customer locations , and the origin @xmath2 stands for a depot .",
    "then , a fleet of vehicles located at the depot must serve all the customers , so that each vehicle can serve at most @xmath3 customers .",
    "the objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by the fleet .",
    "the @xmath3-tc problem ( capacitated vehicle routing problem ) is one of the central special cases of a more general vehicle routing problem , introduced by dantzig and ramser @xcite fifty years ago , and studied very extensively in the literature ever since ( cf .",

    "the @xmath3-tc problem contains the tsp problem as a special case and it is known to be @xmath4-hard for all @xmath11 . for this reason ,",

    "the most extensively studied variants of @xmath3-tc are the metric one , when the distance function is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality , and in particular the _ two - dimensional euclidean _ one ,",

    "one of the first studies of two - dimensional euclidean @xmath3-tc has been due to haimovich and rinnooy kan @xcite , who presented several heuristics for the metric and euclidean @xmath3-tc , including a ptas for the two - dimensional euclidean @xmath3-tc with @xmath12 , for some constant @xmath13 ( * ? ? ?",

    "this significantly enlarges the set of values of @xmath3 for which a ptas is known .",

    "the heuristic starts from constructing a tsp - tour @xmath36 through @xmath0 .",

    "we can find a @xmath40-approximation of the tsp in time @xmath41 .",

    "[ cor : mst ] if the iterated tour partitioning heuristic uses the minimum spanning tree heuristic for tsp then it returns a @xmath42-approximation of an optimal @xmath3-tour cover of an @xmath1-point set and it can be implemented in time @xmath43 .",
    "in this section we present a reduction that takes as an input any instance of the @xmath3-tour problem on a set of @xmath1 points in the euclidean plane and reduces it to an instance of the problem with @xmath19 points .",
    "then , we apply this reduction to obtain a ptas for the @xmath3-tour problem for all @xmath18 , where @xmath44 is some positive constant , @xmath7 .",
    "our construction uses a series of transformations that eliminate most of the input points and reduce the input problem instance to a significantly smaller one .",

    "since @xmath47 , we can ignore any point that is at a distance at most @xmath48 from the origin : covering all such points with @xmath49-tours will give us additional cost not greater than @xmath50 .",

    "define a _ location _ to be any point on the plane that is the intersection of a circle and a ray .",
    "since @xmath57 there are @xmath58 circles and @xmath59 rays . therefore we obtain :    [ claim : num_locations ] the total number of locations @xmath36 satisfies @xmath60 .",
    "now , we transform the input set @xmath0 and move each point from @xmath0 to its nearest location .",
    "the operation of moving each point to its nearest location can change the cost of a @xmath3-tour by at most @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath32 be a point in @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that @xmath32 lies between the circles with radius @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( the distance between @xmath32 and the origin is in the interval @xmath64 $ ] , so we know such circles exist ) .",

    "the distance between two consecutive locations at the @xmath52-th circle is less than @xmath66 .",
    "therefore the distance between @xmath32 and its nearest location is at most @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "if we move a point @xmath30 by a distance at most @xmath69 , the cost of a tour can change by at most @xmath70 .",
    "if we add up the changes of the cost generated by moving all points in @xmath0 , then this total change is upper bounded by @xmath71 .",
    "next , we use fact [ fact : weak - bound ] to conclude that the total cost of moving all the points is at most @xmath72 .    from a @xmath3-tour @xmath73 for a modified instance of the problem ( where all points have been moved to their nearest locations ) we can easily get a @xmath3-tour @xmath24 for the original version of the problem such that @xmath74 .",
    "so a ptas for the modified version yields a ptas for the original version . in the rest of this paper we will consider the modified version of the problem .",

    "note that the origin is not considered as a location .    to prove our theorem",
    "we will need the following :    [ lemma : opt - has - no - cycles ] there is an optimal solution in which there are no cycles .",

    "@xmath91 denotes @xmath92 .",
    "observe that the modification does not change the number of points visited by each tour .",
    "it also does not increase the length of any tour .",
    "therefore , we obtain another optimal solution , in which the sum over all nontrivial tours of the number of locations visited by that tour is smaller than in @xmath24 ( we managed to remove one location from each tour @xmath78 for which @xmath93 ) . this is a contradiction with the minimality of that sum in @xmath24",
    ".    therefore the optimal solution @xmath24 has no cycles .    consider an optimal solution without cycles .",
    "note that the lack of @xmath40-cycles means that no two tours visit the same pair of locations .",
    "to each nontrivial tour we can assign a pair of distinct locations visited by this tour .",
    "the chosen pairs are in one - to - one correspondence with the nontrivial tours and they induce an acyclic undirected graph on the locations .    hence , we can have at most @xmath94 nontrivial tours in an acyclic solution , so using lemma [ lemma : opt - has - no - cycles ] we have proved the theorem .",
    "observe that theorem [ th - t - nontrivial - tours ] implies that there is an optimal solution in which at most @xmath96 points are covered by nontrivial tours .",
    "therefore it is enough to consider only solutions which fulfill that property .",
    "if the number of points in a location @xmath84 is greater than @xmath96 , some of the points will have to be covered by trivial tours .",
    "we may assume , without loss of generality , that among all trivial tours visiting a given location there is at most one that visits less than @xmath3 points .",
    "moreover , if at least one point from some location is visited by a nontrivial tour , we can assume that all trivial tours visiting that location contain exactly @xmath3 elements .",
    "therefore , for each location @xmath84 containing @xmath97 points , we only have to consider at most @xmath98 points for nontrivial tours . after finding a @xmath16-approximation for such reduced case , we will add trivial tours covering all remaining points . that will give us @xmath99approximation for the original problem .",

    ", we shall eliminate the polylogarithmic dependency of @xmath1 in the reduction .",
    "this will have only a relatively small effect on the asymptotics for the size of the largest @xmath3 in terms of @xmath1 for which we can attain a ptas and we will obtain a ptas for all @xmath109 , where comparing to the bound in theorem [ main : theorem ] , we will have @xmath110 .",
