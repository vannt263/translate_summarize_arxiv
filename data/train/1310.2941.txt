    "stellar bar - shaped structures within galaxies , or more simply ` bars ' , have been known to exist since the days of edwin hubble . with only the 100 inch telescope at mount wilson ,",
    "hubble accurately surmised that bars were abundant in the local universe .",
    "so abundant , that he devoted a major part of his classification scheme , the hubble sequence of galaxies @xcite , to barred galaxies .",
    "decades later , infrared and optical studies have confirmed that many galaxies have bars . indeed , among local disk galaxies , as many as two thirds are barred ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "bars have an important influence on galaxy evolution .",
    "the presence of bars has been linked to the existence of spiral arms , rings @xcite , and/or disky pseudobulges @xcite .",
    "bars have also been associated with an increase in central star formation @xcite , the flattening of galactic chemical abundance gradients @xcite , and , perhaps , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity @xcite .    given that bars",
    "have an important influence on galaxy evolution , two natural questions are `` how do bars form and evolve ? '' and `` how do they affect their host galaxies ? '' a review of the theoretical work on bars is given by @xcite , so we will only summarize here the parts that are most relevant to this work ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many past theoretical works have shown that bars can redistribute the angular momentum of the baryons and dark matter of a galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the angular momentum is emitted mainly by stars at ( near-)resonance in the bar region and absorbed mainly by ( near-)resonant material in the spheroid ( i.e. , the halo and , whenever relevant , the bulge ) and in the outer disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a03 ) .",
    "a03 showed that the redistribution of angular momentum is not merely a side - effect of bars , but is , instead , a process that is closely coupled to the evolution of bars .",
    "specifically , the exchange of angular momentum from the inner disk to the outer disk and/or spheroid ( bulge / halo ) is the main driver of bar evolution .",
    "the efficiency of the angular momentum exchange is primarily dependent upon the mass distribution and velocity dispersion of the disk and spheroid .",
    "more angular momentum can be redistributed if the spheroid mass density at the location of the resonances is high , leading to stronger bars ( a03 ) .",
    "the second factor governing the efficiency of angular momentum exchange is the velocity dispersion . in lower velocity dispersion ( lower temperature ) disks and spheroids",
    ", resonances can emit or absorb more angular momentum than in cases with high velocity dispersion , thereby making the transfer of angular momentum more efficient ( a03 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this redistribution of angular momentum allows bars to drive gas , and to a lesser extent , stars , to the centers of galaxies .",
    "this process is responsible for the increase of bar length and strength and of the disk scale length ( e.g. , @xcite , , @xcite , a03 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the formation of a disky pseudobulge @xcite , the increase of central star formation @xcite , and the dilution of abundance gradients @xcite .",
    "this process is known as secular evolution @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that bar formation and evolution is also dependent on the gas content in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recent simulations  with a multi - phase description of the gas , including star formation , feedback and cooling , and a sufficiently large number of particles to describe adequately the gas flow  have shown that bars form later in simulations with a larger gas fraction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter amr13 ) .",
    "recent observational works have begun to test many of these predictions .",
    "for example , @xcite used classifications from galaxy zoo 2 ( see  [ data : gz ] ) , to show that the fraction of disk galaxies that possess a bar ( bar fraction ) increases in redder disk galaxies ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this result was confirmed by @xcite , who also used a large sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , but with their own classifications ( combining a mix of visual and automated methods ) . assuming that galaxy color is closely related to galactic gas content ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then this is consistent with the expected effects of gas on bar formation and evolution .",
    "indeed , using a sample of galaxy zoo 2 bars with hi measurements from the alfalfa survey , @xcite found that bar fraction correlates strongly with hi content . in that sample",
    ", more bars were found in the gas poor disk galaxies , even at fixed color or stellar mass .",
    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite found different results using samples of sdss galaxies with bars identified from ellipse fitting methods .",
    "both of these works found that bar fractions were larger for the bluer ( and presumably more gas rich ) galaxies in their samples .",
    "however , @xcite suggest a way to reconcile these results which came from samples of disk galaxies with very different selections ; notably @xcite and @xcite selected only blue galaxies as disks , and included lower redshift and less massive galaxies than were present in @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "the sample of @xcite , which probed a wide range of stellar mass , suggested that bar fraction is bimodal with disk galaxy color  having peaks both towards the bluer and redder disk galaxies@xmath2 . @xcite",
    "suggest this trend may reveal two distinct types of bars , namely weak bars are predominantly found in lower mass and more gas rich ( and bluer ) spirals , while stronger bars are more common in massive , redder and gas poor disks .",
    "in addition to the dependence on galaxy color , bar fraction has also been found to depend on inner galactic structure .",
    "@xcite found that bar fraction was correlated with fracdev , which is a parameter measured by the sdss representing the fraction of the best - fit light profile that originates from the de vaucouleurs fit to the profile , as opposed to an exponential fit .",
    "@xcite also found that the bar fraction was highest at moderate central velocity dispersion .",
    "however , @xcite found that barred galaxies are most likely to exist in galaxies with low srsic indices while @xcite found that bars are most likely to exist in galaxies with low concentration indices .",
    "although these results appear conflicting , they all show that the presence of a galactic bar is influencing the inner structure of these galaxies .",
    "while the trends of bar fraction can reveal aspects of bar formation and evolution , bar fraction is crude as it hides information on the bar itself . according to a03",
    ", the characteristics of a bar ( e.g. , long or short ) can be used as tracers of bar evolution .",
    "therefore , a common bar property that has been studied in the literature is bar length . @xcite and a03 predicted that the presence of a bulge will result in a longer and more evolved bar . comparing this prediction to previous observational works",
    "shows a good consensus ; early - type disk galaxies do indeed have longer bars @xcite .",
    "larger samples and/or infra - red imaging continues this agreement @xcite .    in this paper , we use the galaxy zoo 2 dataset @xcite to investigate how the likelihood of a galaxy hosting a galactic bar depends on two important factors , namely the gas content of the galaxy and its inner galactic structure .",
    "we perform the same investigation with bar length and compare both of these sets of relationships to theoretical predictions , which will not only give us a better understanding of bar formation and evolution , but also a better understanding of how bars affect their host galaxy .",
    "we begin in  2 by describing all the data used in the paper , while the main observational results are presented in  3 .",
    "we compare our results with several theoretical simulations in  4 and discuss our work , and these comparisons , in  5 .",
    "we conclude in  6 . in appendix",
    "a , we discuss the completeness of our sample .",

    "where possible , we use the standard photometric and structural parameters provided by the sdss pipeline . for example",
    ", we use the sdss information to define a surface stellar mass density within a radius of one kiloparsec of the center of the galaxy , @xmath13 .",
    "we choose one kpc for this density as it matches the typical scale of bulges @xcite and therefore , should be closely related to the bulges of most galaxies .    in detail , @xmath13 is created from the sdss galaxy surface brightness profiles , profmean , which is the mean surface brightness in a series of circular annulii , from the photoprofile table in the casjobs website . in accordance with the sdss recommendations , we take the inverse hyperbolic sine of each cumulative profile and fit them with a natural cubic spline . after transforming the spline fits back with a sine function , we differentiate the fits and obtain an estimate of the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile .",
    "finally , we compute the magnitude and color within one kpc for each galaxy from these profiles and convert them into a stellar mass through a color - dependent mass - to - light ( @xmath14 ) ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "one concern is that the one kpc radius aperture is smaller than the typical seeing of sdss .",
    "however , an analysis of angular sizes of galaxies in our sample , which lies within the redshift range @xmath7 ( see  [ data : gz ] ) , shows they are typically larger than the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the sdss point ",

    "galaxy zoo is a citizen science project that enlisted hundreds of thousands of volunteer  citizen scientists \" to make morphological classifications of nearly one million galaxies @xcite .",
    "the initial galaxy zoo project asked the public to classify galaxies as elliptical , spiral , or merger . with the galaxy zoo 2 project @xcite ,",
    "the citizen scientists were asked to make more detailed classifications of approximately 304,000 galaxies .",
    "the final product of galaxy zoo 2 is a table of morphological likelihoods , including the likelihood that a bar is present in each galaxy , as represented by @xmath19 , e.g. , if 5 out of 10 scientists classified a galaxy as having a bar , the galaxy would be assigned a bar probability of @xmath20 .",
    "these raw probabilities are then adjusted to account for the reliability of each user through an iterative weighting scheme that  down - weights \" classifications from unreliable users ( typically a few percent of the population ) .",
    "we also apply a correction to the likelihoods to account for the deterioration of the image quality due to increasing distance of galaxies , i.e. , we assume galaxies of a similar luminosity and size will share the same average mix of morphologies regardless of redshifts .",
    "this also assumes there is no significant evolution within the sdss at these low redshifts , which is probably reasonable @xcite .",
    "therefore , throughout the paper , we will only use these corrected , or  debiased \" , bar likelihoods and will calling them @xmath19 for convenience .    in @xcite and @xcite , barred galaxies were selected using @xmath21 .",
    "this threshold delivered a high purity of barred galaxies in comparison with other barred galaxies sample , e.g. , almost all galaxies with @xmath21 were classified as possessing a strong bar by @xcite ( see appendix a of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "weaker bars in @xcite were found to correspond to @xmath22 @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we choose to use @xmath19 as a bar likelihood , rather than as a bar threshold .",
    "this method has been used before with galaxy zoo classifications ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with other gz results who used bar fractions , e.g. , if we adopt a bar threshold of @xmath20 , we find an overall bar fraction of @xmath23 , which is similar to @xcite .",
    "our initial sample is the galaxy zoo 2 dataset .",
    "following @xcite , we only select galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range of @xmath7 . in order to have a volume - limited sample , we only include galaxies with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the rest - frame absolute petrosian @xmath18-band magnitude .",
    "this limit corresponds to the galaxy zoo 2 completeness petrosian magnitude of 17 in the @xmath18-band @xcite at @xmath26 . to ensure that our sample contains relatively face - on galaxies",
    ", we applied an axis ratio requirement of @xmath9 ( this corresponds to inclination angles less than @xmath27 60 degrees ) , where @xmath28 is the axis ratio from the gim2d single srsic model fit ( see  [ data : gim2d ] ) .",
    "this requirement minimizes projection effects and thus results in more reliable bar classifications .",
    "this sample also requires that all galaxies have a petro90 radius of @xmath29 .",
    "we have tested our results with a larger minimum radius requirement and find that our results are unchanged . ] .",
    "we also require that for each galaxy , at least a quarter of all its classifications involved answering the bar question , _ `",

    "assuming that most identified features are associated with a disk , then this last selection effectively ensures we have non - edge - on disk galaxies .",
    "finally , we discard all merging galaxies from the sample since we are only concerned with isolated galaxies that have reliable photometric and structural measurements . according to @xcite",
    ", the galaxy zoo merging parameter , @xmath30 , can identify merging galaxies with a cut of @xmath31 ; we adopt this threshold to eliminate merging galaxies .",
    "there is a total of 14,038 galaxies in the resulting sample , which we will call the galaxy zoo 2 disk ( gz2d ) sample .",
    "we carefully review here the make - up of our sample to avoid confusion with comparisons with other disk , spiral or late - type selections based on gz morphologies .",
    "the disk galaxy selection presented herein possibly includes a fraction of very early - type disks galaxies ( sa or s0 ) which would normally be included in a majority of early - type samples selected either by color , or central concentration .",
    "this results in our diverse disk galaxy sample showing bimodality in their optical color - mass diagram ( fig .  [",

    "however , other galaxy zoo samples , that are more focused on late - type disks or spirals sample ( sb , sc or later ) can be constructed using the gz1 `` clean '' spiral criterion as first discussed in @xcite , and most recently used in schawinski et al .",
    "( 2013 , in preparation ) , but also through stricter limits in gz2/gz hubble data .",
    "this more conservative late - type sample will be more dominated by `` blue cloud '' spirals and thus show less bimodality of their galaxy properties .",
    "in addition to this sample , we use a galaxy zoo 2 subsample that possesses additional bar length measurements .",
    "the bar lengths were visually measured by citizen scientists using a google maps interface described by @xcite .",
    "the bar lengths represent the lengths from one end to the bars to the other . in order to be consistent with previous works , who define it as the semi - major axis of maximum ellipticity in the bar region ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , we will take half of the galaxy zoo 2 bar lengths and denote it @xmath32 .",
    "this catalog requires at least 3 independent bar length measurements per galaxy ; the mean of these independent bar length measurements gives @xmath32 of each galaxy .",
    "the vast majority of galaxies that were selected for this sample have @xmath33 , i.e. , this sample contains mainly strong bars @xcite . of the gz2d sample ,",
    "there are 1,734 galaxies that have bar length measurements , which will now be referred to as the bar length ( bl ) sample .",
    "we present a gallery of barred galaxies with a range of @xmath19 and @xmath32 in fig .",

    "each row is ordered by absolute bar length .",
    "two - dimensional bulge+disk decompositions in the @xmath16 and @xmath18 bandpasses of over a million sdss galaxies were performed with gim2d by @xcite .",
    "improvements to the sky background determinations and object deblending over the standard sdss procedures led to more robust galactic structural parameters than those offered by the standard sdss pipeline .",
    "three different models were used in these decompositions : a pure srsic model , an @xmath34 bulge + exponential disk model , and a srsic ( free - floating @xmath35 ) bulge + exponential disk model .",
    "the most important gim2d parameter for the gz2d sample is the galaxy srsic index , @xmath35 , from the pure srsic model , i.e. , the best - fitting single srsic index for a given galaxy .",
    "the srsic index has often been used to separate early - type and late - type galaxies and is widely regarded as a good proxy for bulge dominance @xcite .",
    "although a similar parameter , fracdev from the sdss database , has been explored by previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath35 is a more common parameter in the literature and has been thoroughly studied ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is also the basis of most galaxy fitting programs ( e.g. , galfit , budda , and gim2d ; @xcite ) , which allows for easier and more consistent comparisons to other works . for reference",
    ", we compare @xmath35 and fracdev in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvsfracdev ] for our gz2d sample .",
    "clearly , the two parameters are correlated .",
    "however , the overdensity of galaxies at fracdev=1 , which accounts for @xmath36 of the gz2d sample , indicates that there is a saturation of galaxy structural information in the fracdev parameter .",
    "indeed , for fracdev=1 , @xmath37 ranges from 0.5 to 0.9 , corresponding to @xmath38 .",
    "a similar effect occurs at fracdev=0 , which accounts for another @xmath39 of the gz2d sample",
    ". our use of srsic index in this paper should be more sensitive than fracdev to the complicated structures of galaxies .",
    "another similar parameter is the petrosian concentration index from sdss .",
    "this parameter has been shown by @xcite to be a better proxy for bulge fraction than the global srsic index .",
    "we would like to note , however , that the global srsic indices that @xcite used were from the new york university value - added galaxy catalog @xcite , which fitted one - dimensional profiles extracted from two - dimensional images using _ circular _ annuli .",
    "the gim2d fits were done using _ elliptical _ annuli , and are two - dimensional fits . as noted by @xcite , this difference in methodology , i.e. , using circular and elliptical apertures , results in a systematic offset between the nyu and gim2d galaxy half - light radius and galaxy srsic index . at the request of the referee , we tested our results using r90/r50 in appendix  [ appendix : r90r50 ]  we find no major impacts to our conclusions .     from the gim2d single srsic model fit and fracdev ( @xmath18 band ) from the sdss database .",
    "the cluster of galaxies at fracdev=1 and fracdev=0 accounts for @xmath40 of the total gz2d sample , indicating that there a loss of galaxy structural information in the fracdev parameter . ]",
    "the most important gim2d parameter for the bl sample is the semi - major axis exponential disk scale length , @xmath41 ; this is needed to properly scale the bar length .",
    "the disk scale length is available in both the @xmath34 bulge + exponential disk model and the srsic bulge + exponential disk model ; we use the latter model bulge + exponential disk model . ] .",
    "as is noted in @xcite , the quality of the gim2d bulge+disk decompositions is highly dependent on the spatial resolution and signal - to - noise of the sdss images .",
    "therefore , it is important to ensure that we only allow model fits that are reliable .",
    "however , since we are only concerned with @xmath41 , picking out reliable decompositions is not difficult . from simard ( priv .",
    "comm . ) , galaxy models with @xmath42 ( the @xmath43 from the srsic bulge + exponential disk model ) accurately model the disk component , and hence we consider all these galaxies . this is understandable since these galaxies are disk - dominated and their corresponding gim2d models will likely yield reliable disk measurements . for models with @xmath44 , simard ( priv . comm . ) recommends considering only galaxies with @xmath45 , where @xmath46 represents the probability that a bulge+disk model is @xmath47 required compared to a pure srsic model @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath44 galaxies that have a high probability of requiring a bulge+disk model are also considered .    to avoid the effects of the sdss point - spread function on the gim2d disk model , we only allow disk models with @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , we impose a strict face - on requirement such that all gim2d model disks have inclination angles of less than 55 degrees .",
    "this corresponds to axis ratios greater than 0.6 , a parameter space that has been shown by @xcite to produce no systematic variations on @xmath41 when using 2d galaxy decompositions .",
    "finally , we require that the fractional errors on @xmath41 ( @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the formal error of @xmath41 from gim2d ) be less than @xmath51 .",
    "this number is approximately two standard deviations above the average @xmath49 of the bl sample .",
    "we choose this conservative cut in order to include only quality disk models .",
    "we note that , although we only model a bulge and disk for these disk galaxies , @xmath52 of which are strongly barred , previous works have shown that , while bulge parameters may be affected by the presence of a bar , the disk scale length is not significantly affected @xcite .",
    "this reliability is evident in the fact that our results are not sensitive to the choice of gim2d bulge+disk model , i.e. , both @xmath41 from the @xmath34 bulge+disk model and the srsic bulge+disk model produce the same results .",
    "furthermore , the gim2d formal errors on @xmath41 are not significantly different from strongly barred systems ( @xmath53 ) and non - barred systems ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we impose a final cut that eliminates all gim2d models where the centers are offset from the input science images by more than one arscecond .",
    "large offsets like these usually represent a bad fit , and , indeed , upon visual inspection , we find that almost all these cases contained bright point sources within the galaxy and/or diffraction spikes from nearby stars . matching the gz2d and bl samples to the gim2d catalogs leave us with 13,328 and 1,159 disk galaxies , respectively .",
    "stellar masses and star formation rates are taken from the mpa - jhu dr7 release .",
    "stellar mass ( @xmath55 ) estimates are calculated using the bayesian methodology and model grids described in @xcite .",

    "these estimates are corrected for nebular emission and a @xcite initial mass function is assumed .",

    "the well - known bimodality between galaxies ( even for disk galaxies ) in the star - forming sequence and those in the quiescent population is clear in our sample and affects not only the galaxies ssfr , baryonic mass , and bulge properties , but also their likelihood of being barred @xcite .",

    "these simulations illustrate that gas slows down bar formation considerably ( amr13 ) .",
    "this is due both to an increase in the duration of the pre - bar phase ( i.e. , the phase during which the disk can still be considered as axisymmetric ) and a decrease in the rate of the bar growth ( i.e. , an increase of the time it takes for the bar to end its growth phase ) , both being compared to the times of the equivalent phases in the gas - poor case .",
    "the secular evolution phase , however , starts roughly at 4.5 gyrs for all cases .",
    "in general , the duration of these phases , as well as the increase of bar strength that they imply , depend on the mass and velocity distribution of the baryonic and dark matter components within the galaxy , as well as on the gas fraction .",

    "these two different types of bulges have different dynamics and , therefore , different effects on the bar formation and evolution phases .",
    "classical bulges predate the bar , so they will influence both phases .",
    "their influence has many similarities to that of the dark matter halo .",
    "namely , they slow down bar formation in the first phase , but , during the secular evolution phase , they help the bar grow by absorbing angular momentum , leading to stronger bars ( @xcite , a03 ) .",
    "thus , simulations predict that bars in galaxies with classical bulges should be stronger than bars in galaxies without classical bulges , assuming all other properties are the same .    on the other hand , disky pseudobulges in barred galaxies",
    "are formed by material pushed inwards by the bar , i.e. , they do not predate the bar and thus can not influence its formation phase .",
    "moreover , disky pseudobulges should not help the bar grow during the secular evolution phase either , since they can not absorb angular momentum .",
    "this is because the radii of disky pseudobulges are considerably smaller than the corotation radius , and also because disky pseudobulges are flat ( spherical - like density distributions , like the classical bulge or the halo , can absorb angular momentum ) .",
    "however , although disky pseudobulges do not affect bar formation or evolution , bars do affect disky pseudobulges .",
    "in fact , bar - driven secular evolution is the primary process of disky pseudobulge creation and growth @xcite .",
    "thus , the theoretical prediction is that stronger bars push more gas inwards , resulting in more massive disky pseudobulges .    a visual approximation of bar formation and evolution is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bar_cartoon ] .",
    "we explain the trends we observe between the likelihood of disk galaxies being barred and their ssfr ( present even at fixed @xmath55 , @xmath35 , or @xmath13 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : barfrac ] ) as being due to the effect of gas on bar formation . in the models , bars form later in disk galaxies with significant gas content , and after they form , they grow slower than disk galaxies with comparably less gas ( amr13 and fig .  [",
    "fig : barevol ] ) .",
    "this predicts that the bar likelihood should be higher in gas - poor galaxies ( i.e. , the quiescent population ) , simply because some of the gas - rich galaxies ( i.e. , the star - forming sequence ) have not yet formed their bars .",
    "thus , taking ssfr as a tracer of gas content , then there is good agreement between simulation results and the trends we find ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "within the star - forming sequence ( defined here as @xmath73 ) disk galaxies do not all have the same @xmath19 , but neither do they all have the same gas content .",
    "there are well known trends between ssfr , stellar mass , and gas content of disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the trend we observe here for @xmath19 to increase as ssfr declines ( and @xmath55 increases ) can be explained as being due to decreasing amounts of gas in the disks of these galaxies .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that if you correct for the typical hi content of a disk galaxy , those galaxies with more hi than is expected for their stellar mass are less likely to host bars .",
    "we observe trends of bar likelihood with the srsic index ( @xmath35 , fig .",
    "[ fig : barfrac]b ) and central surface stellar mass density ( @xmath59 , fig .",
    "[ fig : barfrac]c ) , where these latter two parameters are considered to be measures of bulge prominence . in the star - forming sequence bar likelihood increases with both increasing @xmath35 and @xmath59 , while the opposite trend is observed in the quiescent population . in order to interpret these trends ,",
    "we need to remember that there are two main types of bulges  the classical bulge and the disky pseudobulge , a distinction which will help explain this dichotomy .",
    "the best way to distinguish these types of bulges involves the use of high resolution imaging of the bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , something that is not available for our large sample .",
    "however one can approximately separate the types with a threshold in the global galaxy srsic index @xcite .",
    "disky pseudobulges generally lie in galaxies with global @xmath74 while classical bulges are found in galaxies with global @xmath75 .",
    "although this method is less accurate than those using high resolution imaging , this is a simple option that is adequate for our purposes .",
    "hence , we adopt this srsic threshold for the rest of the paper to distinguish the two types of bulges galaxies that have no bulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , for simplicity , we consider all galaxies with @xmath74 to contain a disky pseudobulge even if it might be a pure disk galaxy .",
    "this will not affect our discussion since pure disks and disky pseudobulges are closely related ( see * ? ? ?",

    "this suggests that the decreasing @xmath19 with @xmath35 and @xmath59 observed in the quiescent disk galaxies is due to @xmath19 decreasing in galaxies with larger classical bulges , while the increasing @xmath19 with @xmath35 and @xmath59 observed in star - forming disks shows that @xmath19 is larger in galaxies with more massive disky pseudobulges .",
    "the classical bulge , like the halo , slows down bar formation due to it ` diluting ' the non - axisymmetric forcing of the bar @xcite .",

    "however there is a clear link predicted between the existence of the bar and the amount of mass in the disky pseudobulge , ( or central 1 kpc ; @xcite ) . for galaxies of a given gas mass ( or ssfr ) , a higher bar likelihood should result in more massive disky pseudobulges , as we observe ( figs .",

    "in fact , there actually appears to be a decrease in scaled bar length for @xmath37 larger than 0.6 ( i.e. , @xmath35 larger than about 4 , equivalent to a more concentrated light profile than the standard @xmath79 de vaucouleurs profile ) .",
    "similarly the scaled bar length stops increasing in the rightmost panel for @xmath80 larger than roughly @xmath81 ( although there seems to be an final increase in scaled bar length at the highest @xmath78 ) .",
    "this decrease in scaled bar length with large @xmath35 and @xmath59 does not disagree with simulation results , and can be attributed to the presence of a very high central mass concentration ( cmc ) .",
    "indeed , our last averaged point is roughly at a @xmath37 value of 0.8 , which corresponds to a srsic index of roughly 6.5 .",
    "this could well be due to a luminosity spike in the center of the galaxy which would hamper the bar growth and evolution if it pre - existed the bar , or if grown later , that would bring a decrease of the bar length and strength ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "an implication of this is that we are confident in our basic understanding of the relationship between bars and their host galaxies .",
    "bars are clearly not stagnant structures , rather they are dynamic , evolving , and furthermore directly influence the evolution of their host galaxies .    while this work only concerns the universe at @xmath93 , the ramifications of this idea reach far beyond the local universe .",
    "there is increasing evidence that bars have been present since @xmath86 ( @xcite ; j. herrington et al .",
    "2013 , submitted . ) , indicating that the evolution of disk galaxies has been affected by bars for the last @xmath94 billion years . moreover ,",
    "if the observed evolution of bar fraction with redshift is extrapolated into the future ( there is now an agreement that bar fraction increases towards lower @xmath95 ) , then bars will soon be present in nearly all disk galaxies , and hence become an even more dominant driver of disk galaxy evolution .",
    "we can not yet claim to understand all aspects of the symbiotic relationship between bars and their host galaxies .",
    "we do not fully understand the complicated behavior we observe between bar length and inner galactic structure in disk galaxies hosting classical bulges .",
    "our tentative explanation is that these trends are due to the presence of cmcs , however this should be tested with much higher resolution imaging to probe the very centers of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , in this work we have not explored many of the parameters that are predicted to affect bar formation and evolution ( e.g. , the dark matter halo and the velocity dispersion of the stars in the disk , @xcite ; a03 ) .",
    "even so , we found a good agreement between theory and observations and all observational trends could be well explained by simulations .",
    "this may be due to the large size of our sample , which allows for a variety of halo properties and of disk velocity dispersions in a roughly similar manner in all ensembles we compared .",
    "finally , the role bars may play in processes which quench star formation is an interesting , and potentially important issue for galaxy evolution that warrants further study .",
    "the most notable success in our comparison between observation and theory is the evidence we present for secular evolution . unlike galaxy mergers ,",
    "secular evolution is a slow and gentle process that is not immediately obvious in images .",
    "there has been previous observational evidence of secular evolution in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however the combination of our large dataset and the observed correlations of bar likelihood _ and _ bar length with inner galactic structure for star - forming disk galaxies makes our results one of the most compelling pieces of evidence of not only the existence of secular evolution , but also of the role of ongoing secular processes on the evolution of disk galaxies .",

    "[ fig : completeness_edge ] ]      the galaxy zoo 2 disk ( gz2d ) sample was selected on the basis of hundreds of thousands of visual morphological classifications collected via the galaxy zoo website . in order for a galaxy to be in this sample",
    ", the majority of volunteers classifying it must have identified ` features ' in it , and identified it as not being an edge - on disk ( see * ? ? ?",

    "in addition we apply an extra cut at @xmath9 to ensure disks are face - on enough to identify bars .",
    "this results in a sample of disk galaxies with a broad mix in hubble types .",
    "objects might contain an obvious disk ( e.g. , sbc , sc ) or a subtle disk ( e.g. , s0 ) . while we do not expect problems in identifying the former in any orientation , s0 galaxies are notoriously difficult ( even for the most expert classifiers ) to separate from ellipticals , if viewed face - on .",
    "we consider in this section if any face - on disk galaxies are missing from our sample .",
    "presumably , if a galaxy had a bar , it would be readily identify as ` featured ' and included in this sample , thus we assume any missing disk galaxies will be non - barred and therefore introduce potential biases into our results .",
    "we use as a comparison sample , the volume - limited parent galaxy zoo 2 sample ( see  [ data : gz ] for details of our initial galaxy zoo 2 sample ) that the gz2d sample was originally drawn from , as well as a sample of edge - on disk galaxies in which we expect all types of disks will be equally easy to identify . as a reminder , the parent galaxy zoo 2 sample has the following criteria :    @xmath96 , where @xmath95 is the sdss spectroscopic redshift .",
    "@xmath97 , where @xmath25 is the rest - frame absolute petrosian @xmath18-band magnitude .",
    "hereafter , this sample will be referred to as the galaxy zoo 2 sample , or simply , the gz2 sample .",
    "we match the gz2 sample to the mpa - jhu catalog for stellar masses and star formation rates , resulting in a total of 43,221 galaxies .    to identify edge - on disks , we use thresholds in the galaxy zoo vote fractions for ` features of disk ' ( @xmath98 ) and for ` edge - on disk ' ( @xmath99 ) , this is slightly more conservative that the recommended thresholds for selecting a ` clean edge - on ' sample as given in @xcite , but we do not expect the selection to introduce any bias with hubble type for disk galaxies .",
    "[ fig : completeness ] compares the number density distribution of the gz2d sample ( panel b ) to that of the whole volume limited gz2 sample ( panel a ) .",
    "both panels are scaled so that the blue scale indicates the same range of density and only bins with at least 2 galaxies are shown . using the gz2 sample as the fiducial completeness standard",

    "contours of the gz2d number density distribution are over - plotted .",
    "we point out that completeness levels of greater than @xmath100 are not expected since the selection on axial ratio ( @xmath9 ) removes approximately half of all disk galaxies . in this plot",
    "we observe the expected bimodality , such that the completeness of high ssfr ( @xmath101 ; ` star - forming ' ) galaxies is much higher ( @xmath102 complete ) than it is for low ssfr ( @xmath103 ; ` quiescent ' ) galaxies ( @xmath104 complete ) .",
    "this reveals the well know correlation between ssfr and morphology - that most star - forming galaxies have disks , and many quiescent galaxies are elliptical , so do not have obvious ` features ' to be selected as part of the gz2d sample .",
    "this test , however , can not reveal if the gz2d sample represents a fair selection of all disks . to test that , we isolate a sample of edge - on disk galaxies",
    "in which we expect all disks ( even s0s ) will be identified .",
    "if the gz2d sample is fairly representative of all disk galaxies , then the ratio of gz2d ( face - on disk ) galaxies to the sample of edge - on disks should be uniform throughout the ssfr - mass diagram ( this assumes all disk galaxies are randomly orientated , which we expect they should be , but also see @xcite , and that the inclination introduces no systematic biases into estimates of ssfr or stellar mass , which is less clear ) .",
    "[ fig : completeness_edge ] compares the number density of the edge - on gz2 disks to our gz2d sample of mildy inclined or face - on disk galaxies .",
    "we show the ratio of the number of galaxies in the gz2d sample to the edge - on gz2 disks sample . only bins with at least 2 galaxies from the edge - on gz2 disks sample are shown and the black contours represent the number density distribution of the gz2d sample . for high ssfr galaxies ,",
    "there are @xmath1057 galaxies in the gz2d sample for every edge - on gz2 disk galaxy .",
    "this is likely due to a combination of the expected number ratios for edge - on and not edge - on disk galaxies ( e.g. , for random orientations , we expect one galaxy with @xmath106 for every five with @xmath107 ) , and the possible effects of increased internal extinction in the egde - on sample causing ssfr to be underestimated .",
    "however we do not expect to be missing systematically any star - forming disk galaxies .    because of the extinction of edge - on galaxies , the sample of low ssfr ( @xmath108 ) edge - on gz2 disks may contain a combination of truly low ssfr disks and reddened intermediate ssfr disks . however , we assume that the reddened intermediate ssfr contribution to the low ssfr regime of the edge - on gz2 disks sample is uniform across stellar mass and only changes the absolute scaling of the number ratio between gz2d and edge - on gz2 disks .",
    "we therefore examine the uniformity of the low ssfr regime in fig .",
    "[ fig : completeness_edge ] to gauge whether the gz2d sample is missing any quiescent disks .",
    "the number ratio between edge - on quiescent disks and face - on quiescent disks is largely uniform ( at @xmath109 oblique disks per edge - on disk ) .",
    "there is , however , hints of a small dearth in the gz2d sample at low masses .",
    "averaging the number ratios at low masses ( @xmath110 ) reveals that we find @xmath111 less gz2d galaxies compared to the average number ratios of the high mass quiescent disks .",
    "the total number of low mass quiescent galaxies in our sample is @xmath112 , so this suggests we may be missing @xmath113 low mass quiescent disk galaxies . presumably , if a galaxy had a bar , it would be readily spotted and included in this sample , thus we assume the missing disk galaxies are non - barred .",
    "we assume that the missing disks have values of @xmath35 and @xmath59 typical for gz2d galaxies of the same mass and ssfr .",
    "we find that the @xmath35 and @xmath114 values of these low mass quiescent disks are roughly uniformly distributed , meaning that the @xmath19 trends with @xmath35 and @xmath59 for the quiescent population are unaffected by this incompleteness",
    ". we can estimate how many unbarred quiescent disk galaxies we are missing for every bin by simply dividing the total number of missing galaxies ( @xmath113 ) by the total number of bins that the quiescent population spans in @xmath35 and @xmath59 , which turns out to be @xmath115 bins .",
    "thus we are missing @xmath116 unbarred quiescent disks in every @xmath117 bin of @xmath35 and @xmath59 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : barfrac]b and [ fig : barfrac]c ) .",
    "even if all five galaxies have @xmath118 this would reduce the average @xmath19 in each bin by at most 5% ( by simply adding 5 more galaxies in the denominator ) .    the number of missing low mass disks in the affected part of fig .",

    "[ fig : barfrac]a shows that the @xmath19 values for the low mass quiescent bins are @xmath120 . adding 10 non - barred ( @xmath121 ) disk galaxies to these bins",
    ", i.e. , adding 10 galaxies to the denominator , reduces these @xmath19 values to @xmath122 . our qualitative results and interpretation are unaffected .",
    "therefore , the missing non - barred low mass quiescent disks do not significantly influence our results .      ]    unlike the gz2d sample , there is not a concern that the bl sample is missing non - barred disks since , as the sample name implies , the bl ( bar length ) sample only contains barred disks .",
    "nevertheless , we want to ensure that it is not suffering any selection bias .",
    "[ fig : completenessbl ] shows the completeness of the bl sample relative to the gz2d sample .",
    "the completeness of bl is approximately bimodal with ssfr . in the high ssfr regime ( @xmath123 )",

    "this completeness bimodality is reasonable because the bl sample is primarily composed of strong bars , which as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : barfrac ] , strong bars mainly lie in the quiescent population .",
    "however , since our analysis splits the bl sample into star - forming and quiescent ( i.e. , fig .",
