    "systems composed by few atoms having large value of the two - body scattering length , @xmath3 , with respect to the natural length , @xmath4 , fixed by the atomic potential , have been the object of an intense investigation both from a theoretical and experimental point of view ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "in fact , they present universal properties : for example , the three - body system displays the efimov effect  @xcite , that means the appearance , in the limit @xmath5 , of an infinite set of bound states accumulating toward the three - particle threshold ; moreover , the three - body spectrum has a discrete - scale symmetry , with an universal ratio between the @xmath6-th and @xmath7-th levels @xmath8 .",
    "the scaling factor depends only on the ratio between particle masses , and for identical bosons of mass @xmath9 it reads @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 ) .",
    "the finite value of @xmath4 implies the existence of a three - body ground state @xmath12 whose value reflects the short range physics , and that , together with the discrete - scale symmetry , completely determines the spectrum . in realistic cases",
    "the ratio @xmath13 is large but finite ; thus , the three - body spectrum reduces to a finite number of states .",
    "a remarkable property in @xmath14 limit appears in the four - body system : two states @xmath15 are attached to each trimer state @xmath16 , one deep and one shallow having universal ratios , @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite ; the two lowest four - body states , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are real bound states .",
    "these properties have been studied for large positive and large negative values of the scattering length in the @xmath21 plane , with @xmath22^{1/2}$ ] , constructing what is normally called an efimov plot  @xcite .",
    "there are very few studies of the spectrum of small bosonic clusters beyond @xmath23 .",
    "in addition to the specific problems related to the solution of the schrdinger equation for more than four particles , the atom - atom realistic potentials present a strong repulsion at short distances which makes the numerical problem more difficult .",
    "specific algorithms have been developed so far to solve this problem : the faddeev equation has been opportunely modified  @xcite , the hyperspherical methods resorted either to the hyperspherical adiabatic ( ha ) expansion ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or to the correlated hyperspherical harmonic expansion ( chh )  @xcite .",
    "however , due to the difficulties in treating the strong repulsion , few calculations exist for systems with more than three atoms .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the diffusion monte carlo method has been used to describe the ground state of @xmath1he molecules up to 10 atoms , and in ref .",
    "@xcite a very extended calculation has been done in the four helium atom system .",
    "on the other hand , descriptions of few - bosons systems using soft - core potentials are currently operated ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the equivalence between hard- or soft - core - potential descriptions has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which an attractive soft @xmath1he-@xmath1he gaussian potential has been used to investigate the three - atom system .",
    "the soft - two - body potential was designed to reproduce the helium dimer binding energy @xmath24 , the @xmath1he-@xmath1he scattering length @xmath3 , and the effective range @xmath25 of the lm2m2 potential @xcite , one of the most used @xmath1he-@xmath1he interactions . in this context",
    "the soft gaussian potential can be considered as a regularized - two - body contact term in an effective field theory ( eft ) approximation of the lm2m2  @xcite ; this is possible because of the scale separation between the @xmath1he-@xmath1he scattering length , @xmath26  a.u . , and the natural length @xmath27  a.u . , which is the van der waals length calculated for the lm2m2 potential  @xcite .",
    "in the two - body sector and in the low - energy limit , the two potentials predict similar phase shifts , therefore , even if their shape is completely different , they describe in an equivalent way the physical processes in that limit  @xcite .",
    "the equivalence is lost as the energy is increased , when the details of the potential become more and more important . when the soft interaction is used in the three - body sector ,",
    "a new three - body - contact term is required to reproduce the ground - state - binding energy of the helium trimer given by the lm2m2 potential .",
    "this term is introduced by means of a gaussian - hypercentral three - body force , whose strength is tuned to reproduce the lm2m2 ground state binding energy of the three - atom system . in ref .",
    "@xcite the quality of this description has been studied for different ranges of the three - body force by comparing the binding energy of the excited efimov state and the low - energy helium - dimer phase shifts to those obtained with the lm2m2 potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite the spectrum of small clusters of helium atoms has been investigated up to six particles maintaining however fixed the values of @xmath3 and @xmath24 as given by the lm2m2 potential .    in the present work",
    "we extend the analysis of the @xmath28 bosonic spectrum to the @xmath21 plane .",
    "we have modified the strength of the lm2m2 potential in order to cover the region of negative values of @xmath3 up to @xmath29 , with this value indicating the threshold of having a three - body system bound .",
    "we have also increased the intensity of the interaction in order to extend the analysis to positive values of @xmath3 in which the universal character of the system starts to be questionable , i.e , when the ground - state @xmath30 approaches the natural energy @xmath31 , which delimits the efimov window .",
    "associate with the different values of @xmath3 of the modified lm2m2 potential , we have constructed a set of attractive gaussian potentials with the strength fixed to reproduce the low - energy data of lm2m2 . moreover , the modifications of the lm2m2 produce different values of the @xmath32 ground state energy @xmath12 ; accordingly , we introduce a soft three - body force devised to reproduce those values along the @xmath21 plane . within this model , consisting in the sum of a two- and three - body potentials , we have calculated the spectrum of the four , five and six particle systems .",
    "two different calculations have been performed in the present work . from one side",
    "we have calculated the @xmath32 ground state and excited state , @xmath12 and @xmath33 , using the lm2m2 potential and its modification , in order to construct the corresponding efimov plot . since this potential present a strong short - range repulsion we have used the chh expansion as discussed in ref .",
    "one the other side , when using the soft - core potential model in systems with @xmath34 , the numerical calculations were performed by means of the non - symmetrized hyperspherical harmonic ( nshh ) expansion method with the technique recently developed by the authors in refs .  @xcite . in this approach , the authors have used the hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) basis , without a previous symmetrization procedure , to describe bound states in systems up to six particles .",
    "the method is based on a particular representation of the hamiltonian matrix , as a sum of products of sparse matrices , well suited for a numerical implementation",
    ". converged results for different eigenvalues , with the corresponding eigenvectors belonging to different symmetries , have been obtained  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "since we are dealing with bosons , we only consider the symmetric part of the spectrum .",
    "interestingly , we have observed that in all the region explored the @xmath35 systems present two states , one deep and one shallow close to the @xmath36 threshold .",
    "to gain insight on the shallow state , for a selected value of @xmath3 , we have varied the range of the three - body force and we have studied the effect of that variation in the @xmath35 spectrum . in the range",
    "considered , the variation produces small changes in the eigenvalues , but they are crucial to determine if the shallow state is bound or not with respect to the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "this analysis confirms , at least in one zone of the efimov plot , previous observations that each efimov state in the @xmath32 system produces two bound states in the @xmath23 system , and extends this observation to the @xmath37 systems .",
    "finally , we have extended the calculations of the @xmath23 and @xmath38 systems up to the four- and five - particle thresholds using the simple two - body - gaussian potential ; the ratios between the thresholds are in agreement with previous theoretical results  @xcite and with experiments  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the two- and three - body forces we used in our calculations to reproduce the lm2m2 values . in section iii",
    "we discuss the efimov plot for three particles . in section",
    "iv the results for the bound states of the @xmath39 clusters are discussed whereas the conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we use the lm2m2 @xmath1he-@xmath1he potential as the reference interaction , with the mass parameter fixed to @xmath40 . in order to explore the efimov-@xmath21 plane ,",
    "we have modified the lm2m2 interaction as following @xmath41    , in units of @xmath4 , as a function of the parameter @xmath42 , calculated with the modified lm2m2 potential @xmath43 .",
    "the range of variation of @xmath42 is between @xmath44 , which corresponds to the disappearance in the continuum of the excited three - body state , and @xmath45 .",
    "the unitary limit is obtained for @xmath46 . ]",

    ". a smaller difference , though still appreciable , can be observed in the first excited state .    in order to have a closer description to the @xmath32 system obtained with the modified lm2m2 potential , we introduce the following ( repulsive ) hypercentral - three - body ( h3b ) interaction @xmath62 with the strength @xmath63 tuned to reproduce the trimer energy @xmath12 obtained using @xmath43 for all the explored values of @xmath42 , as shown in fig .

    "in the present paper we have discussed the spectrum of bosonic systems up to six particles interacting through a two - body potential having a large two - body scattering length ( with respect to the effective range ) .",
    "the three - body scale has been fixed using a scaled helium - helium potential .",
    "the scope was to extend previous studies on the efimov physics done in the three- and four - body systems .",
    "we have observed that , similarly to the four - body system , the five- and six - body systems present two bound states , one deep and one shallow .",
    "it seems that this type of spectrum is to some extend universal depending only on the condition @xmath176 in the two - body system .",
    "this condition produces a geometrical series of bound states in the three - body system and , attached to each of these states , a two - level spectrum has been showed to appear in the four - body system  @xcite",
    ". however they are true bound states only in correspondence to the lowest trimer level .",
    "the other states appear as resonances embedded in the continuum of four particles .",
    "it is possible to introduce a repulsive three - body force that eliminate all the trimer states below one specific level . in this way",
    ", the two level spectrum of the four - body system attached to this trimer ground state will become true bound states .",
    "also the universal character of the spectrum will be more evident as the repulsive three - body force will push more and more the particles faraway .    though the analysis of the bosonic spectrum can follow the strategy illustrated above , in the present paper we follow a different one based on the physics introduced by the two - body potential . in nuclear systems as well as in many atomic systems",
    "the two - body interaction has a sharp repulsion at short range followed by a very weak attractive part that produces very shallow dimers as for example the deuteron or the two - helium molecule .",
    "the particles are located in the asymptotic region and do not feel the details of the interaction .",
    "therefore , we can introduce a soft potential to be considered as a regularized - two - body contact term in an eft approximation of the original potential  @xcite .",
    "in the three - body sector , a three - body - contact term is required to reproduce the ground - state - binding energy of three - particles introduced here by means of a gaussian - hypercentral three - body force . using this potential model",
    "we have calculated the three - body spectrum and we have analyzed its universal character comparing the energy of the shallow state @xmath97 to the efimov s equation for the binding energy .",
    "furthermore we have identified the critical values @xmath29 and @xmath109 at which @xmath177 and @xmath178 respectively .",
    "successively we have calculated the four- , five- , and six - body spectra and we have observed the two - level structure .",
    "the eft approach is better adapted to describe shallow states and this is confirmed by the close result obtained for @xmath179 mk at @xmath50 and the lm2m2 result @xmath180 mk , very recently published  @xcite .    the universal character of the structure of these clusters has been studied using tjon lines , that means the relation between @xmath137 and @xmath139 , and between @xmath138 and @xmath140 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tjon ] , we have obtained an almost linear relation between @xmath137 and @xmath139 ( upper panel ) and between @xmath138 and @xmath140 ( lower panel ) in the region from @xmath50 to @xmath167 . as the energy of the cluster , @xmath139 or @xmath140 , tends to zero the linear relation",
    "is lost .    since we are describing the lowest bound states ,",
    "some universal ratios are only approximately verified , though not very far from the values quoted by other groups in @xmath181 . however , in the simple case of tbg we have extended our calculations for @xmath23 and @xmath38 up to the four- and five - particle continuum threshold in order to calculate the ratios between the thresholds : the values we obtain in the four - body case , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and in the five - body system @xmath164 and @xmath165 , are in accord with the ratios that have been previously predicted  @xcite and measured  @xcite in literature .    another interesting aspect is the uncertainty introduced by the cutoff in the hypercentral three - body force .",
    "we have observed that with the most natural choice @xmath182 the shallow states @xmath170 and @xmath183 result unbound in the last part of the curves .",
    "they cross the respective threshold @xmath169 and @xmath171 .",
    "increasing @xmath65 they result bound again around @xmath184 .",
    "increasing further @xmath65 they become again unbound .",
    "this last analysis is somehow inconclusive as to really understand the cutoff dependence we need to vary both cutoff @xmath66 and @xmath65 in a coherent way ; the dependence on the cutoff will eventually reflect the leading order nature of the potential we are using , pointing to the necessity of going to a higher order in the eft expansion  @xcite .",
    "studies along this line are at present under consideration as well as the analysis of the two - level spectrum for cluster with more than six particles .",
