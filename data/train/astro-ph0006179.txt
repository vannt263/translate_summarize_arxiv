    "the _ field _ blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars have often been used to trace the galactic halo .",
    "recent surveys of _ distant bhb stars _ include those of pier ( 1983 ) , sommer - larsen & christensen ( 1986 ) , flynn & sommer - larsen ( 1988 ) , sommer - larsen et al .",

    "the _ nearby bhb stars _ have been discovered sporadically over the past sixty years @xmath10 the majority by strmgren 4-colour photometry .",
    "pre - eminent among the discoverers have been a. g. davis philip ( philip 1994 ) and stetson ( 1991 ) .",
    "the only attempt , however , to obtain a complete sample of the nearby bhb stars ( and hence a local space density ) appears to be that by green & morrison ( 1993 ) .",
    "following philip et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , they showed that a bhb star must not only have the appropriate strmgren @xmath16   and c@xmath17   indices , but must also show little or no rotational broadening in high - resolution spectra .",
    "this criterion must now be somewhat modified since peterson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found bhb stars with @xmath5  as large as 40 km  s@xmath7  in the globular cluster m13 .",
    "philip et al . also considered that a bhb star must have an appropriate location in the c(19@xmath10v)@xmath18 vs. ( b@xmath10y)@xmath18 diagramv ) index is derived from the magnitude at 1900   in iue spectra and the v magnitude of the star . ] . in the solar neighbourhood",
    ", disk stars greatly outnumber halo stars and there is a relatively high probability of finding disk objects whose strmgren indices are close to those of bhb stars . to emphasize this , we give , in the appendix  a",
    ", a non - exhaustive list of stars whose colours resemble those of bhb stars but which most probably do not belong to this category . _",
    "the use of high - resolution spectra is mandatory for the selection of bhb stars in the solar neighbourhood since both accurate abundances and @xmath5  are needed as criteria .",
    "_    high resolution studies of nearby rr lyrae stars have been made by clementini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and by lambert et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . both the rr lyrae and bhb stars may be expected to have similar galactic kinematics .",
    "there are , however , _ disk _",
    "rr lyrae stars in the nearby field , but there are ( as far as we know ) no corresponding nearby field bhb stars that have disk kinematics .    while it is known that the field bhb stars generally show the low metal abundances that characterize halo stars , early determinations of these abundances show a rather wide scatter ( see table a27 in ksk ) .",
    "the first reliable determination was probably that based on the co - added photographic spectra of hd 161817 by adelman et al .",
    "the metallic lines in the visible spectra of bhb stars are relatively weak and early photographic spectra did not have adequate signal - to - noise to measure these lines with sufficient accuracy . also , until relatively recently , it was not known with certainty whether or not the evolution from the tip of the giant branch to the blue end of the horizontal branch ( with significant mass - loss ) would change the composition in the stellar atmospheres and whether diffusion effects would be present .",
    "glaspey et al .",
    "( 1989 ) observed two hb stars in the globular cluster ngc 6752 .",
    "the hotter ( 16000 k ) showed low rotation , a strong overabundance of iron and a helium deficiency .",
    "the cooler ( 10000 k ) showed a higher rotation and no abundance anomalies compared to the red giants in the cluster .",
    "an example of a hot ( 16430 k ) field hb star is feige 86 which was analyzed by bonifacio et al .",
    "they found overabundances of the heavy elements and other pecularities which might be attributed to diffusion .",
    "lambert et al . ( 1992 ) used an echelle spectrograph with a ccd detector to obtain moderately high - resolution spectra ( @xmath0/@xmath1 18000 ) of two bhb stars ( with @xmath2  @xmath610000 k ) in the globular clusters m4 and ngc 6397 .",
    "they found that their metallicities agreed well with those found previously for the red giants in these clusters .",
    "caloi ( 1999 ) proposed that the gap observed in the hb sequence in many globular clusters at a ( @xmath19 )  of about zero is a surface phenomenon and that stars with @xmath2  @xmath1410000 k will show peculiar chemical compositions .",
    "grundahl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have noted that a jump in both strmgren @xmath20 and @xmath3   occurs for stars hotter than @xmath2  =  11500 k in the ehb of globular clusters and suggest that this marks the onset of radiative levitation .",
    "this would explain the results of glaspey et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and the more recent discoveries of strong overabundances of fe in these hotter stars in the globular clusters ngc 6752 ( moehler et al . 1999 ) and m13 ( behr et al . 1999 ) .",
    "behr et al . ( 2000 ) find that the hb stars in m13 that are cooler than @xmath2  =  11000 k have high rotation ( @xmath5  @xmath21 40  km  s@xmath7 ) while the hotter stars have a low rotation as might be expected if radiative levitation is operating .",
    "all stars in our sample are cooler than 11000 k because hotter stars can not easily be identified as bhb stars by their strmgren indices",
    ". we should therefore expect them to have chemical abundances that are similar to those of other halo field stars such as halo rr lyrae stars and halo red giants .",
    "we should not expect abundance anomalies to be present , and none have been reported , in the cooler field bhb stars that have previously been observed .",
    "in addition to hd  161817 ( adelman & hill 1987 ) , abundances have been derived from ccd spectra for ten other nearby field bhb stars ( adelman & philip 1990 , 1992 , 1994 , 1996a , 1996c ) .",
    "we consider that the abundances of bhb stars based on photographic spectra by klochkova & panchuk ( 1990 ) are less accurate because of the poor agreement of their equivalent widths with those obtained from ccd spectra .",
    "the aim of the present study is to provide data for a reliable sample of the bhb stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "this includes the colour distribution , the reddenings , the stellar parameters , the projected stellar rotations ( @xmath5  ) and the abundance ratios .",
    "these data can be compared with data for bhb in globular clusters and in other parts of the galaxy .",
    "the galactic orbits of about half the stars in our present sample have recently been calculated and analyzed by altmann & de boer ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is intended , in a future paper , to derive the galactic orbits not only for this bhb sample but also for other local samples of halo stars so that these may be compared .",
    "these samples can help us to determine a better overall definition of the local halo and determine to what extent it may be distinguished from the disk populations .",
    "green & morrison ( 1993 ) found 10 bhb stars among the 23 candidates that they studied and considered that their sample was incomplete for bhb stars with v @xmath14 8.5 .",
    "nearby _ bhb stars have been identified among high proper motion stars and so any sample of them will have kinematic bias .",
    "thus stetson ( 1991 ) made 4-colour observations of high proper motion early - type stars taken from the sao catalogue .",
    "more bright bhb stars might well be discovered by using a more recent source of proper motions such as the ppm star catalogue ( rser & bastian 1991 ) in which a larger fraction of the stars have spectral types . to do this , even for a part of the sky ,",
    "would be a large undertaking and we have therefore chosen to limit our observations to previously identified bhb star candidates .",
    "strmgren photometry can only be used to distinguish bhb stars that are redder than @xmath16  @xmath21@xmath100.01  mag , so that the hotter stars ( belonging to the extended horizontal branch ) are excluded .",
    "this paper enlarges the local sample of definite bhb stars , but does not affect our knowledge of the local bhb space density because this depends only on the number of the very brightest of these stars .",
    "our sample is limited to stars that are brighter than @xmath22 = 10.9 ; these stars are near enough to have significant proper motions and bright enough for their high - resolution spectra to be obtainable with the kitt peak coud feed spectrograph and with the eso - cat spectrograph .",
    "thirty - one nearby bhb candidates were selected from the literature .",
    "bd  + 00  0145 was listed by huenemoerder et al .",

    "the final adopted photometry is given in boldface .",
    "the new photometric observations were made by kinman with the mk iii photometer on the kitt peak 1.3-m telescope ( with chopping secondary ) on the @xmath39  system as described by ksk .",
    "additional @xmath39  observations were also made with the kitt peak 0.9-m telescope using a 512 @xmath40 512 ccd under control of the ccdphot program ; details of this observing system are given by kinman ( 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath39  photometry gives ( @xmath19 )  on the johnson system and a hybrid @xmath23  index from the strmgren @xmath20 filter and the johnson @xmath41 filter .",

    "a @xmath23  vs ( @xmath19 )  diagram using the most recent data is shown in fig .  3 of kinman ( 1998 ) .",
    "there is a satisfactory separation of the bhb stars and rr lyrae stars with ( @xmath19 )  @xmath11 0.00 , but bluer than this the separation becomes rapidly more difficult .",
    "the @xmath23  vs ( @xmath19 )  diagram gives a satisfactory way of distinguishing fainter bhb stars at high galactic latitudes because the risk of confusion with other types of early - type stars is not too severe and the integration times are smaller than for the strmgren photometry ; this is an important consideration for faint stars . in the solar neighbourhood ,",
    "however , there is a wide variety of early - type stars and these diagrams can only be used to provide bhb candidates .",
    "some idea of the accuracy of the adopted photometric data can be appreciated from the plots of @xmath16  against ( @xmath19 )  shown in fig .  1 .",
    "with the exception of the post - agb star ( bd + 32 2188 ) , which has a lower gravity than the remaining stars , the bhb star candidates approximately follow the linear relationship : @xmath42 which is shown by the dashed line in fig  1 .",
    "none of the bhb stars depart from this relation by more than 0.01  mag in @xmath16 .",
    "this suggests that these quantities are not likely to be in error by more than one or two hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "hipparcos magnitudes ( which are of high accuracy and on a very homogeneous system ) are available for twenty one of the thirty stars given in table  1 .",
    "it was found that the difference ( @xmath43 ) between the hipparcos magnitude and the mean @xmath22 magnitude for our bhb star candidates could be expressed as the following linear function of @xmath44 : @xmath45 the hipparcos catalogue ( vol .",
    "1 ) ( 1997 ) gives values of @xmath43 for various @xmath46 in table 1.3.5 and values of @xmath46 for different @xmath44 in table 1.3.7 .",
    "thus the catalogue values of @xmath43 may be obtained for various @xmath44 .",
    "these @xmath43 agree well with our linear relation at a @xmath44 of 0.00 and 0.22 but are up to 0.01 magnitudes larger at intermediate @xmath44 .",
    "the catalogue @xmath43 are for  early type stars \" and we have preferred our relation because it refers to the specific class of stars that we are studying .",
    "our linear relation was therefore used to convert the hipparcos magnitudes to @xmath22 magnitudes and these are our adopted magnitudes .",
    "if no hipparcos magnitude is available , the weighted mean @xmath22 magnitude was adopted .",
    "significant systematic differences exist between values of the strmgren @xmath28",
    "-index made by different observers ( joner & taylor 1997 ) .",
    "fortunately , many of the bhb candidates have been observed by stetson ( 1991 ) and were therefore on one system .",
    "new @xmath28  observations of a selection of our candidates were made using bhb ( and other stars of similar colour that were observed by stetson ) as standards so as to be on his system  index is very valuable because it is not changed by interstellar extinction but it does require measuring to a high accuracy to be useful .",
    "the central wavelength of the narrow h@xmath28 filter undoubtedly shifts with temperature and this means that careful calibration is needed in order to get onto the standard system . ] .",
    "these new @xmath28 values are given in the first line of table  1 , when the source k(n , m , o ) is given .",
    "it should be noted that the large radial velocities of bhb stars can cause their h@xmath28 line to be shifted ( in the case of hd 161817 by as much as 6    ) from the rest wavelength .",
    "the fwhm of the narrow h@xmath28 filter is only 30   , so that small inaccuracies may be expected from this cause . as a check ,",
    "synthetic @xmath28  indices were determined by measuring the  magnitudes \" of the h@xmath4-line through 30   and 150   bandpasses in our spectra ( which do not include h@xmath28 ) using the _ magband _ routine in the ctio package of iraf .",
    "it was found that these synthetic @xmath28  indices ( on the photoelectric system ) could be derived as a linear function of the difference between the broad and narrow h@xmath4  magnitudes \" ; these synthetic indices are given in column 5 of table 15 .",
    "in general , these synthetic @xmath28  agree well with the mean photoelectric values of @xmath28  taken from hauck & mermilliod ( 1998 ) and given in table  1 and with our adopted values that are also given in table 16 .",
    "the @xmath47 difference between our synthetic @xmath28  and the adopted photoelectric values for the bhb stars is @xmath150.009 if we omit hd 161817 for which the difference is 0.031 .",
    "photometric data both from the far ultraviolet and from the infrared can also be used for the determination of the interstellar reddening and stellar parameters .",
    "these data are discussed in sects 5.4 and 7.5 respectively .",
    "high resolution spectra of the thirty - one candidates were obtained either with the kitt peak coud feed spectrograph or with the eso - cat spectrograph at la silla , chile ; six stars were observed at both observatories .",
    "the journals of the observations are given in table  2 and table  3 for kitt peak and eso respectively .",
    "these tables contain the coordinates ( columns 2 and 3 ) and @xmath22 magnitude ( column 4 ) of each star .",
    "the ut date , starting time and duration of each integration is given in columns 5 , 6 and 7 . the s / n of each spectrum ( column 8) was determined by using the iraf @xmath48 task which determined the ( @xmath49 ) near the @xmath04481  mgii  line in each spectrum .",
    "the measured heliocentric radial velocities and their @xmath47 errors are given in columns 9 and 11 and the number of lines used is in column 10 .",
    "the agreement between the two sets of observations for the stars in common is satisfactory if we consider the number of lines that were available and also that three of these stars ( hd  16456 , hd  202759 and possibly hd  139961 ) are variable .",
    "the spectra of bd  + 00  0145 and hd  014829 have a significantly poorer quality than the others and were not used for a complete abundance analysis .",
    "we were able , however , to measure the equivalent width of the @xmath04481 mgii  line in these spectra and so derive an approximate [ fe / h ] for these stars as explained in sect .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of the northern bhb candidates were made by kinman and harmer using the kitt peak 0.9 m coud feed spectrograph .",
    "the long collimator ( f/31.2 ; focal length 10.11 m ) and camera 5 ( f/3.6 ; focal length 108.0 cm ) were used with grating a ( 632 grooves / mm ) in the second order with a corning 4 - 96 blocking filter .",
    "this gives a 300    bandpass covering @xmath50",
    "4260@xmath104560 which includes both h@xmath4 , the mgii  @xmath04481-line and a selection of fei , feii  and tiii  lines .",
    "the detector was a ford 3 kb chip ( 3072@xmath401024 pixels ) with a pixel size of 15 microns .",
    "this gives a 3-pixel resolution of approximately 0.3 .",
    "the nominal resolution at 4500  is therefore 15000 .",
    "biases were taken at the start of each night and a series of flat field quartz calibration exposures were taken at the start and end of each night .",
    "thar arc lamp spectra for wavelength calibration were made at the start , end and at frequent intervals during each night .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf proceedures of bias subtraction , flat field correction and the extraction of the [ 1-d ] spectrum .",
    "the wavelength calibration was made using the thar arc spectrum that was closest in time to the program spectrum .",
    "the spectra were normalized to the continuum level interactively by using an updated version of the norma code ( bonifacio 1989 , castelli & bonifacio 1990 ) .",
    "these normalized spectra were used to derive stellar parameters from the h@xmath4-profile and for the comparison with the synthetic spectra .",
    "the southern bhb candidates were observed by bragaglia with the cat + ces ( coud auxiliary telescope , 1.4 m diameter + coud echelle spectrograph ) combination at la silla , chile , during april and september 1995 .",
    "this equipment gives a single echelle order which was observed with two different instrumental configurations .",
    "in april we used an rca ccd ( eso # 9 ) , 1024 pixels long , covering about 40   at a resolution of 0.14   ( or r @xmath27 30000 ) , while in september the detector was a loral ccd ( eso # 38 ) , 2688@xmath40512 pixels , covering about 50   at a resolution of 0.11   ( or r @xmath27 40000 ) . in both cases",
    "the spectra were centered on the @xmath04481  mgii  line .",
    "integration times ranged from 10 to 70 minutes ; the faintest stars were observed twice .",
    "the eso - cat spectra also were reduced with standard iraf proceedures .",
    "the extraction of the [ 1-d ] spectra from the [ 2-d ] images was performed weighting the pixels according to the variance and without automatic cleaning from cosmic rays .",
    "the wavelength calibration also was computed from a series of thorium arc - spectra and is estimated to be accurate to a few hundredths of an  .",
    "iraf tasks were used to clean the spectra from cosmic rays and defects , for flattening and for normalization .      in order to be able to compare the spectra with the models , they were transformed to zero velocity using the iraf @xmath51 routine .",
    "line positions and equivalent widths were obtained from the reduced spectra using the iraf @xmath48 routine , approximating ( or deblending , if necessary ) lines with gaussians functions .",
    "when either two kpno or two eso - cat spectra were available for the same star , they were measured independently and the values of the equivalent widths were averaged .",
    "the comparison with the synthetic spectra was made , however , with the spectrum of highest quality in order to compare h@xmath4 profiles , to derive stellar parameters , to test abundances ( derived from the averaged equivalent widths ) , to test the microturbulent velocity and to derive the rotational velocities .",
    "our measured equivalent widths , together with the derived abundances ( sect .  8) , are given in table  4 and table  5 for the kpno and eso - cat spectra respectively .",
    "the wavelengths and multiplet numbers in these tables are taken from moore ( 1945 ) .",
    "2 gives a comparison of the equivalent widths that we and other observers obtained from the spectrum of hd  161817 .",
    "fig.2 ( a ) compares the equivalent widths obtained from the 1994 kitt peak spectrum of hd  161817 with those obtained from a spectrum that was taken with the same equipment at the end of the night of 1995 may 03 ut and which has a significantly poorer focus than any of our other program spectra ; even in this case , the effect on the equivalent widths appears to be minor .",
    "the comparison in ( b ) is with the early photographic observations of kodaira ( 1964 ) which were made with the palomar coud spectrograph ( 10 / mm ) and shows a fairly large scatter ( presumably because of the low s / n of single photographic exposures ) but the systematic differences are small .",
    "the comparison in ( c ) with the more recent photographic observations of klochkova & panchuk ( 1990 ) , however , shows substantial differences in the sense that the equivalent widths of these authors are systematically too large with respect to the present measurements . on the other hand , the systematic agreement of our data for this star with those of adelman et al .",

    "the noise in the kpno ccd spectrum is such that some of the fainter lines ( equivalent widths less than about 30 m ) can be quite distorted .",
    "such lines can generally be recognized and omitted from our analysis .",
    "4 compares the equivalent widths for hd 74721 , hd 86986 and hd 93329 from the kpno spectra with those measured by adelman & philip ( 1994 , 1996a ) using the same equipment .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory except for the feii @xmath04555 and tiii @xmath04563 lines in hd 74721 .",
    "the kpno equivalent widths give abundances that are in agreement with the other lines of these species and were preferred .",
    "otherwise , these various comparisons give no evidence for significant systematic differences between our equivalent widths and those given by adelman & philip .",

    "6 ; they are numbered as in table  1 .",
    "the determination of the chemical composition of the bhb stars requires a knowledge of the parameters that govern the physical conditions in their atmospheres such as the effective temperature ( @xmath2 ) , the surface gravity ( @xmath3 ) , the microturbulent velocity ( @xmath52 ) and also assumptions about convection .",

    "the colours @xmath53 and @xmath81 sample contiguous parts of the energy distribution and so are highly correlated ; @xmath81 is closer to the 2200   feature and can be more noisy because it is near the edge of the energy distribution in the swp spectra .",

    "this makes it difficult to get accurate results when they are fitted to the computed spectra .      for stars cooler than about 8000  k , the h@xmath4 profile is a good temperature indicator because it is almost independent of gravity , while for hotter stars with @xmath2  between 8000  k and 10000  k it depends on both @xmath2  and @xmath3 . above 10000",
    "k , h@xmath4 becomes a good gravity indicator , because it is almost independent of temperature .    in order to derive the stellar parameters from the h@xmath4 profiles given by the kpno spectra",
    ", we fitted the observed profiles ( normalized to the continuum level ) to the grids of profiles computed with the balmer9 code ( kurucz , 1993a ) . for each star",

    "we found that the fit was insensitive to the adopted value of @xmath52 .",
    "we used an interactive routine to omit all the lines of other elements which affect the h@xmath4 profile , and by linear interpolation , we derived the residual intensities r@xmath94(i ) of h@xmath4 for each @xmath0(i ) sampled in the observed spectrum .",
    "we then used the same fitting procedure as that used to derive the parameters from the energy distributions . for each star , the parameters @xmath2  and @xmath3  are those which give the minimum @xmath47 difference .    for stars cooler than 8000",
    "k , this procedure gives @xmath2 , but not @xmath3 , because the h@xmath4 profile is not sensitive to gravity for these temperatures .",
    "therefore , to derive @xmath2  for these stars , we adopted the average @xmath3  from the strmgren photometry and uv colours , since small differences in @xmath3  do not change the value of @xmath2 .    for stars with @xmath2  between 8000  k and 10000  k both @xmath2  and @xmath3",
    "can be obtained by the fitting procedure , but the situation is less satisfactory because some ambiguity occurs in this range .",
    "for example , for [ m / h ] = @xmath101.5 , the h@xmath4 profile is almost the same for @xmath2  = 8800  k , @xmath3  = 3.0 as for @xmath2  = 9500  k , @xmath3  = 3.4 .",
    "this means that very small differences in the reduction procedure may give very different values for the parameters .",

    "the main error in deriving @xmath2  and @xmath3  from h@xmath4 comes from the uncertainty in the normalization of the kpno spectra ; this is largely because of a small non - linear distortion in the spectra which means that it is not a straightforward task to decide where the wings of h@xmath4 start .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath2  produced by the extraction procedure of the unblended h@xmath4 profile is of the order of 50  k.      as we discussed in sect .",
    "5 , the parameters derived from the ultraviolet fluxes are those which lead to the most consistent values of reddening when one compares the observed @xmath53 colours and also the observed @xmath53 vs. @xmath16   colours with the corresponding theoretical values .",
    "the parameters found in this way are on the  uv \" lines in table  7 .    as a further check , we compared the whole uv - observed energy distributions , for the stars that have both short- and long - wavelength iue data , with model energy distributions computed with the adopted parameters given in table 7 .",

    "we therefore , in addition , determined @xmath52 by comparing the observed spectra against a series of synthetic spectra in which @xmath52 was sampled in steps of 1.0 km  s@xmath7 ; in a few cases an intermediate step of 0.5 km  s@xmath7  was used .    in the case of bd  + 00  0145 and",
    "hd  14829 and for the stars observed at eso we assumed a microturbulent velocity @xmath52 of 2.0  km  s@xmath7 , since there were too few lines in their spectra to allow us to derive @xmath52 .    in computing the synthetic spectra , we used either the mean abundance derived from the equivalent widths for species with more than one measured line ( e.g. fei , feii , and tiii ) or the abundance computed from a single line if only one line of a species was available ( e.g. baii @xmath04554 ) .",
    "the synthetic spectra were computed at a resolving power of 500000 and then were degraded to 15000 ( the nominal resolution of the kitt peak spectra ) using a gaussian instrumental profile .",
    "the computed spectra were then broadened by the rotational velocity ( @xmath5 ) that is given in column 2 of table 15 .",
    "this @xmath5  was derived by fitting the observed profile of the mgii  4481    to the computed profile assuming the mg abundance that had been derived from the measured equivalent width .",
    "no macroturbulent velocity was considered .",
    "the comparison of our observed spectra with the synthetic spectra showed that some of the lines in our original list should be discarded either because they were blended or because they were too weak .",
    "the width program was now used to recompute new abundances from the equivalent widths ( w@xmath103 ) of the remaining lines using the value of @xmath52 that had been determined from the synthetic spectra .",
    "we made several iterations using both the comparison of the observed and the computed w@xmath103 and the comparison of the observed and synthetic spectra until the abundances obtained by the two methods were consistent . in the course of the successive iterations we changed the @xmath52 and the metallicity of the models so that they were as close as possible to the values that we derived from the abundance analysis .",
    "the measured equivalent widths ( w@xmath103 ) , the adopted @xmath104 , their sources , and the logarithmic abundances relative to the _ total number of atoms _ are given for the individual lines for each star in table  4 for the kpno spectra and in table  5 for the eso - cat spectra .",

    "both values are given in table  9 ( that from the synthetic spectra is identified with the superscript s ) .",
    "the slight systematic difference between the abundances obtained by the two methods may be related to the placement of the continuum level which was fixed independently by kinman for the measurement of the kpno equivalent widths and by castelli for the normalization of the whole observed spectrum .",
