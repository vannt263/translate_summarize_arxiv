    "one of the reasons why dispersionless ( or flat ) bands are interesting is that they accommodate , when partially filled , an exponentially large number of states .",
    "this macroscopic degeneracy can be lifted when interactions are added , often leading to rich strongly correlated phenomena .",
    "the best known example is the fractional quantum hall effect , which arises from the degeneracy within flat landau bands for particles in a magnetic field .",
    "in addition to the landau problem , other models with flat bands have been studied at least since the 1970s , such as amorphous semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "this system is idealized by a lattice made up of clusters of sites .",
    "both inter - cluster and intra - cluster hoppings are allowed . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", it turns out that the intra - cluster hopping term in the hamiltonian is a projection operator , leading to the existence of flat bands  @xcite .    in the 1980s ,",
    "flat bands were studied in relation to the nielson - ninomiya theorem  @xcite by dagotto _",
    "they showed that it is possible to escape the fermion - doubling problem at the price of having an extra flat band in the spectrum . in this way",
    ", the low energy degrees of freedom of the theory can be described as a single weyl species .",
    "more recently , ohgushi _",
    "@xcite studied flux phases in the kagome lattice , which is the planar section of ferromagnetic textured pyrochlores .",
    "if the flux is staggered then electrons accumulate a spin berry phase as they hop .",
    "this system contains _ isolated _ flat bands , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are protected by a gap . on the other hand , bergman _",
    "et al _ have studied flat bands _ without a gap _ in similar lattices  @xcite not threaded by fluxes . in their models , a flat band is degenerate with one or more other bands at a single point , and the touching is topologically protected .",
    "each of the works above has identified interesting , but seemingly disconnected , properties of flat bands .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to understand the different types of flat band spectra , the conditions to obtain them , and the properties that follow .",
    "this paper is organized around five main findings .",
    "first , flat bands can be isolated by breaking time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "second , isolated flat bands can be viewed as critical points . on either side of the phase boundary",
    "the flat band becomes positively or negatively curved , which corresponds to transitioning from a particle - like to a hole - like band .",
    "we also find an anomalous hall effect on either side of the transition , whose sign depends on whether the band is electron - like or hole - like .",
    "third , when the gap between a flat band and its neighboring bands closes with the flat band in the middle , the system is described by a single spin-1 conical - like spectrum .",
    "this extends to higher angular momentum the spin-1/2 dirac - like spectra in topological insulators and in graphene .",
    "fourth , one can obtain multiple ( parallel ) flat bands and we provide a concrete example of this case .",
    "fifth , we find , for all examples studied here , that the chern number of the flat bands is zero . so as opposed to landau levels , we get no quantized hall conductance for these particular flat bands .    ( a ) and @xmath0 on the up and down triangles of the kagome lattice .",
    "the dispersion on the left ( type i ) corresponds to @xmath1 and @xmath2 while the dispersion on the right ( type ii ) corresponds to @xmath3 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] ( b ) and @xmath0 on the up and down triangles of the kagome lattice .",
    "the dispersion on the left ( type i ) corresponds to @xmath1 and @xmath2 while the dispersion on the right ( type ii ) corresponds to @xmath3 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the model with which we will start our analysis is a simple kagome lattice with a tight - binding interaction and two staggered fluxes , @xmath4 and @xmath0 , on alternating triangles . depending on the values of @xmath5",
    ", dispersions can be classified into three types : ( i ) a flat band touches two linearly dispersing bands at the same point , where the linear bands are reminiscent of a  dirac - like \" point , but with spin-1 behavior , ( ii ) an isolated flat band that is separated from bands above and below by a gap , and ( iii ) a gapless flat band that touches a single massive energy band either above or below .",
    "the energy dispersions corresponding to types i and ii are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome - zero ] .",
    "type iii has been discussed recently  @xcite in hexagonal and kagome lattices without magnetic flux , and it was found that in this case the zero gap is protected by topological arguments  @xcite .",
    "type iii has been also shown to exhibit a topological insulator phase in the presence of spin - orbit interactions  @xcite .",
    "type ii appears when electrons accumulate a spin berry phase as they hop from site to site , which is equivalent to both up and down triangles with the same magnetic flux  @xcite .",
    "type i necessitates the staggered fluxes @xmath6 that we analyze below .    we will show that the condition for a flat band to occur at @xmath7 is @xmath8 . by changing the value of the fluxes in such a way that their sum differs slightly from @xmath9 , the flat band acquires a small curvature , which can be positive or negative depending on the values of @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , the band curvature implies that if the fermi energy is chosen to be zero , then by tuning the fluxes it is possible to change the center of the band from an electron - like pocket to a hole - like pocket .",
    "this leads to an inversion of the sign of the anomalous hall response  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the flat band condition @xmath8 represents a quantum critical point separating two regions with different anomalous hall responses .",
    "type i is remarkable in that it displays linearly dispersing modes , akin to those of graphene , but differing in two important ways .",
    "first , the conical points do not appear in pairs as in graphene , but instead there is only one such point within the first brillouin zone ( bz ) ( see fig . [",
    "fig : kagome - zero ] ) .",
    "second , these are not dirac fermions ( this is why it is possible to evade the doubling problem ) , but instead the effective hamiltonian in momentum space is of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the spin-1 angular momentum operator ( @xmath12 is the fermi velocity ) . the spin-1-type spectrum ( like the spin-1/2 dirac - type spectrum of graphene ) can be viewed as a single quantum spin in a magnetic field , as in berry s original work on quantum phases  @xcite , but with the wave vector @xmath13 playing the role of the magnetic field .",
    "type i does not require the breaking of trs . however , we show that a gap can be opened while leaving the flat band untouched by breaking trs , and thus type i is continuously connected to type ii . in type ii",
    "the degenerate states within the flat band are protected by the gap at finite temperature , and would provide a fertile base to construct correlated states .    finally , we will generalize the above results on the kagome lattice to other lattices by a formulation similar to straley  @xcite , but again adding staggered fluxes . as an example , we take a hexagonal network , similar to graphene , but with three degrees of freedom at each site .",
    "we will consider two hopping strengths in this case , one for inter - site hopping between nearest neighbors ( @xmath14 ) and one on each vertex for intra - site permutations between the three species ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "each permutation will be associated with a flux @xmath5 on the two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we will show that the kagome model can be obtained from this in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "additionally , we will show that the honeycomb lattice admits _ two _ parallel flat bands that are isolated from each other and all other bands , which is a feature that the kagome lattice does not have .",

    "<S> dispersionless bands , such as landau levels , serve as a good starting point for obtaining interesting correlated states when interactions are added . with this motivation in mind , </S>",
    "<S> we study a variety of dispersionless ( `` flat '' ) band structures that arise in tight - binding hamiltonians defined on hexagonal and kagome lattices with staggered fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> the flat bands and their neighboring dispersing bands have several notable features : ( a ) flat bands can be isolated from other bands by breaking time - reversal symmetry , allowing for an extensive degeneracy when these bands are partially filled ; ( b ) an isolated flat band corresponds to a critical point between regimes where the band is electron - like or hole - like , with an anomalous hall conductance that changes sign across the transition ; ( c ) when the gap between a flat band and two neighboring bands closes , the system is described by a single spin-1 conical - like spectrum , extending to higher angular momentum the spin-1/2 dirac - like spectra in topological insulators and graphene ; ( d ) some configurations of parameters admit two isolated parallel flat bands , raising the possibility of exotic `` heavy excitons '' and ( e ) we find that the chern number of the flat bands , in all instances that we study here , is zero . </S>"
