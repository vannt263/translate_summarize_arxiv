    "<S> our findings strongly suggest that the strong tunability of the electric - field - induced second - harmonic generation signal in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides may find applications in miniaturized electrically switchable nonlinear devices . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1]b with fits using sech@xmath22functions . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra shown were recorded for a gate voltage @xmath23 which corresponds to the point where inversion symmetry is maximally restored for the bilayer crystal embedded in the microcapacitor device as will be discussed in detail later . </S>",
    "<S> the monolayer region of the crystal exhibits a shg response that is more than two orders of magnitude stronger than the bilayer region , an observation attributed to the explicitly broken inversion symmetry in the single layer limit .  </S>",

    "<S> the observed maximum spectrally coincides with the c - resonance , which can be qualitatively described both by excitonic effects  @xcite and by the band structure in a free - particle picture where it is associated with a high joint density of states in the vicinity of the @xmath29 point in the brillouin zone ( bz ) as discussed in the supporting information .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the c - resonance is common in various tmdcs and is accompanied with a high optical absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the shg signal at the c - resonance for bilayer mos@xmath0 is enhanced by approximately one order of magnitude as compared to off - resonant excitation , in good agreement with recent observations on noncentrosymmetric mono- and trilayer mos@xmath0 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite moreover , the electronic structure and , therefore , the nonlinear optical response of the c - resonance is very robust with respect to changes in the dielectric environment as introduced by the al@xmath0o@xmath11 capping layer ( see pump - laser energy dependent shg of capped and pristine monolayer mos@xmath0 in the supporting information ) . </S>",

    "<S> for later discussion , the excitation energy @xmath31 can also be translated into a detuning @xmath32 of the corresponding second - harmonic energy with respect to the characteristic energy of the c - resonance @xmath33 . clearly , the shg intensity for the maximum applied gate voltages @xmath34 is significantly enhanced as compared to zero applied bias at @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the minimum shg intensity is observed at @xmath23 which reflects the cancellation of the built - in field due to polarization charges in the surrounding dielectric environment that is manifested by a field offset @xmath36 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2]b . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this characteristic tuning pattern to an electrically controlled breaking and restoration of the crystal inversion symmetry , mediated by the external voltage ( electric field ) applied to the bilayer mos@xmath0 crystal . </S>",
    "<S> this is in strong contrast to refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and  @xcite where the shg tunability emerges from electrostatic charge doping dependent phenomena in tmdc flakes connected to a charge carrier reservoir by an electrical contact . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> the tmdc flake is fully electrically isolated from the contacts due to the surrounding dielectric layers . in this particular case , </S>",
    "<S> the net dipole moment of the bilayer is zero due to the oppositely oriented in - plane dipole moments of both layers . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a nonzero effective applied electric field @xmath38 , the crystal inversion symmetry is explicitly broken , analogous to the monolayer mos@xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3]a on a semi - logarithmic scale . here , we used 3d finite element ( comsol ) simulations to convert the applied gate voltage in electric field strengths .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the bilayer we observe a strong decrease of the shg intensity when sweeping from large electric fields ( @xmath39 ) towards @xmath40 with a pronounced minimum at @xmath41 as indicated by the dashed black lines . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry breaking in the bilayer leads to the observed strongly induced nonlinear response . in strong contrast </S>",
    "<S> , the monolayer exhibits a completely different characteristic field dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of inversion symmetry manifests itself by an almost field independent shg response owing to its symmetry point group . </S>",

    "<S> for the bilayer , we observe an approximately 60-fold ( 11-fold ) enhanced nonlinear response under nonresonant excitation at @xmath30 at @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) compared to the inversion symmetric case at @xmath44 within the electric fields ( voltages ) applied in our experiments . </S>",
    "<S> for strongly broken inversion symmetry at @xmath39 the shg intensity almost reaches similar intensities as the monolayer . since the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] shows no sign of saturation , it indicates that one can obtain switchable shg response from the bilayer producing a response comparable to a monolayer that lacks inversion symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the field ( voltage ) dependent shg signal is in good agreement with an expected quadratic dependence @xmath45 as indicated by the fit in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a , which means that the susceptibility scales linearly with the applied voltage ( electric field ) . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence was first reported in early work on efish  @xcite and later observed in molecules  @xcite , solid state systems  @xcite and gases  @xcite .    to gain more insight into the origin of the electric field tunable shg </S>",
    "<S> , we simulate the nonlinear response of bilayer mos@xmath0 under the influence of external electric fields , as described in the methods section . before considering nonlinear optical effects , however , we study the linear response of bilayer mos@xmath46 in the independent - particle approach ( ipa ) to identify the c - resonance @xmath33 , which is discussed in more detail in the supporting information . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a theoretical value of @xmath47 , which we use to express the second - harmonic emission energy @xmath3 for the simulated results in terms of the detuning @xmath48 , which has been introduced above for the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated field dependent @xmath49 for detunings of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b . as a general trend , a linear dependence on the external electric field strength for fixed second - harmonic energy </S>",
    "<S> is observed , where the slope of the signal reflecting the tunability depends on the specific second - harmonic energy . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a quadratic dependence of the measured shg intensity on the applied field strength , as observed in the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the magnitude of the @xmath49 is @xmath53 smaller than comparable theoretical results for monolayer mos@xmath46 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : p_2 ] ) , this means that we expect from theory a bilayer shg intensity ( @xmath54 ) that is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the monolayer signal if strong electric fields are applied . </S>",
    "<S> + in the final section of this letter , we investigate the electric field dependent shg response of bilayer mos@xmath46 for a varying fundamental laser excitation energy . for this purpose , we swept the fundamental laser excitation energy @xmath2 in steps of @xmath55 and measured the field dependent shg response @xmath3 . resulting shg intensities as a function of external electric field and detuning with respect to the experimentally identified c - resonance at @xmath56 are presented in a false color plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a minimum signal intensity throughout all laser excitation energies at @xmath57 ( corresponding to @xmath58 ) as indicated by the white dashed horizontal line , in agreement with the built - in field offset discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum corresponding to the c - resonance at @xmath59 for a fixed electric field is clearly visible in this color representation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , significant tunability of the shg emission throughout the whole detected shg signal energy range is observed . </S>",
    "<S> cuts for constant effective applied electric fields of @xmath60 ( black ) , @xmath61 ( red ) , @xmath62 ( green ) and @xmath63 ( blue ) are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b . for the highest electric fields </S>",
    "<S> applied , we observe a significant increase in shg signal and additional finestructure in contrast to restored inversion symmetry at @xmath63 with only the c - resonance . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , stronger tunability for negative detunings is observed while positive detunings yield a decreasing tunability . </S>",
    "<S> +    we can qualitatively compare the experimental results with the corresponding calculated emission energy dependent susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> resulting susceptibilities from dft simulations which correspond to the measured emission - energy dependent shg spectra in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b , are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c for @xmath64 ( black ) , @xmath65 ( red ) , @xmath66 ( blue ) and @xmath67 ( green ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding real and imaginary part of the susceptibility for @xmath64 and @xmath67 is shown in the supporting information . </S>",
    "<S> we find an energy dependence that is similar to the experimental spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the weak tunability around the c - resonance as compared to the tunability at @xmath68 can be understood from the different amount of symmetry breaking at the respective regions of the bz where the shg signal is generated . to visualize this effect , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate two - particle wave functions over the bz using the procedure introduced in the supporting information and compare results with and without an external electric field . in the absence of an electric field </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions exhibit the full sixfold symmetry expected from the crystal point group of the bilayer . by applying an electric field inversion symmetry </S>",
    "<S> is broken , as can be seen by comparing the left and right panels in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . at the c - resonance ( @xmath50 , upper panels ) </S>",
    "<S> , we observe characteristic features between the @xmath29 and m points , which are only slightly modified under the influence of an external field . in turn , for a detuning of @xmath69 ( lower panels ) the wave functions show strong features around the @xmath70 point . </S>",
    "<S> due to a different admixture of the atomic orbitals to the bloch states in this part of the bz the wave functions exhibit stronger symmetry breaking for non - vanishing electric fields in comparison to the c - resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour transfers to the stronger shg tunability for emission energies below the c - resonance , which is observed in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> + we would like to point out that breaking the inversion symmetry of the bilayer e.g. by application of the external dc field is a neccessary but not sufficient condition to obtain a second - harmonic signal . </S>",
    "<S> an additional requirement is the hybridization of the two individual mos@xmath46 layers forming the bilayer that particularly mixes sulphur orbitals from both layers . as stated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there is no out - of - plane third - order susceptibility tensor element for uncoupled tmdc layers in ab - stacking . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , independent of an applied dc field , the nonlinear polarizations generated by two decoupled layers cancel due to their opposite orientation in the ab - stacking configuration . in the presence of hybridization </S>",
    "<S> though there is a formation of bonding and antibonding states that contain orbital character from both layers . </S>",
    "<S> if a dc field is applied in this situation , the nonlinear polarizations , which are microscopically electron - hole excitations , get a more hole - like character in the layer in direction of the dc field and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a net polarization from the bilayer and hence a nonzero shg signal . </S>",
    "<S> we underline this effect by numerical calculation , comparing shg spectra with applied field @xmath67 for coupled and decoupled mos@xmath46 layers ( see interlayer spacing dependent calculation of @xmath7 in the supporting information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the decoupling of layers is realized by artificially doubling the interlayer distance in the dft calculation and is verified by the fact that the band structure of two decoupled layers is given by two degenerate monolayer band structures ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the shg signal of the decoupled layers is reduced by at least three orders of magnitude , which demonstrates the interplay between dc field and hybridization effects in the shg from bilayer mos@xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> + in summary , we have demonstrated pronounced efish of the shg intensity of 2h stacked bilayer mos@xmath0 . employing dft </S>",
    "<S> we find a linear dependence of the @xmath49 ( quadratic dependence of the shg intensity ) with applied electric field in good agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we find that hybridization between the two individual layers is a necessary requirement for generating efish . </S>",
    "<S> our results show integrability of field effect devices combined with even - layered tmdcs that enable the electrical control and enhancement of nonlinear optical processes by electrically altering the crystal inversion symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> potential schemes for prospective devices could exploit the switchable nonlinearities in bilayers for fast optical modulators . </S>"
