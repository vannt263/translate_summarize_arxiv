    "for a long time the effects of microscopic diffusion were neglected in the construction of solar models . during the last two decades helioseismology",
    "has strongly constrained our view of the sun and the importance of microscopic diffusion has been demonstrated by many authors ( e.g. bahcall et al . , 1995 ; christensen - dalsgaard et al . , 1996 ; richard et al . , 1996 ( rvcd )",
    "; brun et al . , 1998a ; turcotte et al . , 1998 ; schlattl , 2002 ; schlattl and salaris , 2003 ) .",
    "microscopic diffusion is now systematically introduced in standard models .",
    "however some significant differences do remain between the helioseismic and theoretical standard models in the region below the convective zone .",
    "several solutions for this discrepancy have been tested , such as opacity changes ( tripathy and christensen - dalsgaard , 1998 ) or turbulent mixing ( rvcd ; brun et al . ,",
    "1998 , 1999 and 2002 ) .",
    "including mixing below the convective zone is also necessary to account for the lithium depletion observed at the solar surface .",
    "this mixing however must not extend too deep as beryllium is not depleted ( balachandran and bell , 1997 ) and the @xmath1he value has not increased significantly during the last 3 gyrs ( geiss and glocker , 1998 ) in previous papers , rotation - induced mixing was introduced in the computations but the feed - back effect of @xmath0-gradients on the mixing was neglected or extremely simplified . in rvcd , all macroscopic motions were supposed to disappear for a given critical @xmath0-gradient , which was adjusted to satisfy the chemical constraints .",
    "recently , the effects of diffusion - induced @xmath0-gradients on the meridional circulation and their consequences have been more deeply studied ( vauclair , 1999 ; vauclair and thado , 2003 ; thado and vauclair , 2003 a and b ) .",
    "numerical tools have been built which can be introduced in the computations of stellar evolution and applied to the solar case .",
    "we have computed new models with the toulouse - geneva evolutionary code , including the most recent physics for the opacities , equation of state , nuclear reaction rates , etc .",
    "we have also introduced diffusion and rotation - induced mixing in a consistent way , including the effects of @xmath0-gradients .    in section 2",
    ", we discuss the observed solar parameters and their uncertainties ; the new physical inputs are presented in section 3 ; section 4 is devoted to the constraints on the mixing processes involved ( rotation - induced mixing and tachocline ) ; the mixing theory is reviewed in section 5 and the results , with our best model , are presented in section 6 .",
    "the solar luminosity @xmath2 , radius @xmath3 , and age @xmath4 allow one to constrain the initial helium abundance , @xmath5 , and the mixing length parameter , @xmath6 , of the standard model .",
    "the luminosity @xmath2 is obtained from the solar constant measured by satellite and varies with the solar activity .",
    "we take @xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 ( guenther et al . ,",
    "1992 ) , which is the mean value between the results of the two space missions ers on _ nimbus _ 7 and acrim on _ smm_. the slightly greater value used by bahcall & pinsonneault ( 1992 ) and the smaller value used by bahcall et al .",
    "( 1995 ) lie inside the error bars ( see table 1 ) .",
    "some recent papers have shown that the solar radius value of @xmath9 cm ( allen , 1976 ) was overestimated .",
    "two different techniques now lead to a smaller value for the radius .",
    "the first one uses solar f - modes : antia ( 1998 ) and schou et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have respectively obtained @xmath10 cm and @xmath11 cm .",
    "the second technique uses the observation of the angular diameter of the sun and atmosphere models .",
    "brown & christensen - dalsgaard ( 1998 ) have found a smaller radius of @xmath12 cm .",
    "for the calibration of our best model we take the mean observed value @xmath13 cm , which is very close to the helioseismic value obtained with the f - modes .",
    "the last parameter used in the calibration is the solar age .",
    "few determinations of the solar age have been done . the meteoritic determination obtained by guenther et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and by wasserburg ( see appendix of bahcall et al . , 1995 ) is respectively @xmath14 gyr and @xmath15 . using the helioseismic frequencies guenther & demarque ( 1997 )",

    "( 1999 ) obtain @xmath17 gyr .    the precise radius at the bottom of the convective zone is also given by the seismic sound speed profile .",
    "christensen - dalsgaard et al . (",
    "1991 ) found @xmath18 .",
    "this value was confirmed by basu & antia ( 1997 ) with a smaller uncertainty ; they gave : @xmath19 , when they used only their models with a smooth composition profile at the bottom of the convective zone .",
    "the helioseismic inversion can also give the helium abundance in the convective zone ( dziembowski et al .",
    ", 1991 ; kosovichev , 1995 ; basu and antia , 1997 ; richard et al . , 1998 ) . the most important uncertainty on the determination comes from the equation of state . with the opal equation of state ( rogers et al . , 1996 ) the typical value obtained for the helium mass fraction @xmath20 is @xmath21 ; with the mhd equation of state ( dppen et al . , 1998 ; hummer and mihalas , 1988 ; mihalas et al . , 1988 ) the results differ more from author to author ( @xmath22 for basu and antia , 1997 , @xmath23 for richard et al . , 1998 ) due to the different inversion method .",
    "basu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have recently studied the equation of state on the upper convective zone .",
    "they have found better agreement for the mhd equation of state than for the opal one on the helium ionization zone .",
    "however more detailed studies need to be done to reduce these uncertainties .",
    "the photospheric abundances of heavier elements used as constraints on our solar models are those determined by grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) .",
    "the values used to calibrate our models are summarized in table [ soltab1 ] .",
    "the present models have been computed including the most recent improvements in the physical inputs :    * equation of state : considering the high precision presently achieved in helioseismology , it becomes necessary to take into account the relativistic effect on the electrons in the core of the solar model ( elliot and kosovichev , 1998 ) . in the present computations ,",
    "we have introduced the new opal equation of state ( rogers and nayfonov , 2002 ) which takes this effect into account .",
    "* opacities : we use the latest opal opacities ( iglesias & rogers , 1996 ) completed by the alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) low temperature opacities . * nuclear reaction rates : we have updated the nuclear routines using the nacre compilation of nuclear reaction rates ( angulo et al . , 1999 ) and added bahcall s screening routine . * microscopic diffusion : we have improved the computation of the microscopic diffusion velocity by using equation 4.7 of montmerle & michaud ( 1976 ) for all elements other than helium .",
    "turcotte et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have pointed out a difference in the surface abundance variations of c , o , and other metals ( z ) , during the evolution , between the toulouse and montreal solar models ( see table 3 of turcotte et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "this difference was mainly due to the thermal part of the diffusion velocity which was underestimated in the expression used by rvcd . with the montmerle & michaud expression ,",
    "the toulouse models have very similar surface abundance variations of c , o , and z as those of the montreal models",
    "models including helium and metal diffusion can not reproduce the observed lithium depletion ( 1/140 ) .",
    "although part of the lithium depletion may occur during the pre main - sequence phase , the main - sequence lithium depletion is likely to be very much larger than that induced by microscopic diffusion alone .",
    "lithium diffuses at about the same rate as helium , so that its abundance would decrease by some @xmath24 only by diffusion . on the other hand , mixing can bring matter from the outer layers down to the place where lithium is destroyed by nuclear reactions , which is much more efficient .",
    "moreover diffusion builds a steep helium gradient below the convective zone which leads to a spike in the sound velocity compared to the seismic sun in this region .",
    "these results suggest the presence of some mild mixing below the convective zone of the internal sun .",
    "macroscopic motions are needed to bring up to the convection zone the nuclearly lithium - depleted matter and to smooth the helium - gradient at the top of the radiative interior . on the other hand we now know that beryllium is probably not depleted in the sun and that the @xmath1he/@xmath25he ratio can not have changed by more than 10% during these last 3 gyrs ( geiss and gloeckler , 1998 ) .",
    "this means that the mixing must not bring too much helium to the convective region and that the beryllium nuclearly - depleted region must not be connected to the convective region through the mixing .",
    "this put strong constraints on the mixing : it must be deep enough to deplete lithium and to smooth the helium - gradient below the convective region but it must be also shallow enough to keep constant the beryllium abundance and the @xmath1he/@xmath25he ratio during the last 3 gyrs .",
    "we have represented on figure [ destruc ] , the lithium and beryllium nuclearly - depleted regions as a function of the age in a standard model ( including diffusion ) . according to the location of the lithium and beryllium nuclearly - depleted regions ,",
    "the mixed zone may extend on a shallow region below the convective zone , down to 0.6@xmath26 at the beginning of the solar life ( where @xmath26 represents the radius of the sun at that time ) and down to 0.55@xmath3 at the solar age .",
    "inversions of rotational splittings have shown that a strong horizontal shear exists in the solar rotation profile at the base of the convection zone in the so - called solar tachocline .",
    "several attempts at estimating the characteristic thickness of this region have been made from helioseismic inversions .",
    "values of this thickness range from @xmath27 ( basu , 1997 ; antia et al . , 1998 ;",
    "basu and antia , 2001 ; charbonneau et al .",
    ", 1998 , 1999 ; corbard et al . , 1998 ) to @xmath28 ( kosovichev , 1996 ; kosovichev et al . , 1998 ) , the thickness being defined as the region where the rotation rate variation inside the tachocline increases from 0.08 to 0.92 of its maximum value .",
    "more recently corbard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) concluded that the tachocline width is very likely below @xmath29 and elliot & gough ( 1999 ) obtained a value of @xmath30 .",
    "as previously mentioned , the beryllium and @xmath1he/@xmath25he solar observations favor of a shallow mixed region below the convective region .",
    "therefore the tachocline may provide an adequate mixing .",
    "however from helioseismic observations the tachocline is extremely thin and , supposing that its width has not been strongly increased in the past , the tachocline - induced mixing is not deep enough to produce a smooth helium gradient below the convective zone .",
    "brun et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have then considered a variable tachocline width during the solar evolution . in these conditions",
    "they have computed models in agreement with helioseismic and chemical observations .",
    "but there is no evidence and no explanation for a variable tachocline with time .",
    "these results are in favor of extra mixing , probably related to the rotation - induced thermal imbalance . in the following we present solar models including both the effects of a tachocline and a rotation - induced mixing . in section [ mixing ]",
    "we present the non - standard physical inputs introduced in the computations : we review the rotation - induced mixing theory together with the main equations , we discuss the stabilizing effects of @xmath0-gradients and we present the chosen tachocline modeling . section [ computations ] is devoted to the computational results .",
    "the theory of rotation - induced mixing in the presence of @xmath0-gradients is introduced in the models .",
    "when the rotation depends little on latitude , the vertical component of the meridional velocity can be expressed in term of the legendre function of order 2 : @xmath31 @xmath32 being the radial coordinate and @xmath33 the colatitude .",
    "the horizontal component of the meridional velocity also depends on the vertical velocity amplitude @xmath34 : @xmath35    in the case of the stationary regime and negligible differential rotation ( as observed from helioseismic studies ) the vertical amplitude can be written : @xmath36 @xmath37 gathers the terms related to the @xmath0-gradients while the classical terms appears in @xmath38 : @xmath39 @xmath40 - 2\\frac{h_t}{r}\\lambda\\right\\}\\ ] ]    here @xmath41 represents the density average on the level surface @xmath42 while @xmath43 is the mean density inside the sphere of radius @xmath44 ; @xmath45 is the temperature scale height ; @xmath46 represents the horizontal @xmath47 fluctuations @xmath48 ; @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent the derivatives : @xmath51    traditionally the meridional currents induced by the @xmath38 term are called @xmath52-currents while the ones induced by @xmath37 are called @xmath0-currents . in the most general case ,",
    "@xmath0-currents are opposite to @xmath52-currents .    the rotational mixing",
    "is then introduced in the computations following zahn(1992 ) and maeder & zahn ( 1998 ) .",
    "the meridional circulation is supposed to induce shear flow instabilities which , in a density stratified medium may lead to large horizontal diffusivities .",
    "the combination of the meridional circulation and horizontal mixing may be treated as a vertical effective diffusion process described with an effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "the chemical transport for the mean concentration of a species @xmath53 is then expressed : @xmath54 where @xmath55 ^ 2}{30 d_h}\\ ] ] @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent respectively the vertical and horizontal part of the shear - induced anisotropic turbulence due to the transport of angular momentum .    in the stationary case , according to chaboyer & zahn ( 1992 ) : @xmath58    in the present paper , the horizontal diffusion coefficient is approximated following maeder & zahn ( 1998 ) : @xmath59 the efficiency of @xmath56 depends on the richarson criterion ( maeder , 1995 ; talon and zahn , 1997 ) .",
    "here we chose to parametrize this coefficient in terms of @xmath60 as for the vertical diffusion coefficient : @xmath61 in this case , @xmath62 can be written : @xmath63 and we can also write : @xmath64 with @xmath65 . @xmath66 and @xmath67 are then unknown parameters . according to the assumption of strong anisotropic turbulence they must satisfied the condition : @xmath68      it has been known for a long time that mixing processes in stars may be stabilized in the regions where the mean molecular weight rapidly decreases with increasing radius ( mestel , 1965 ; huppert and spiegel , 1977 ) .",
    "this occurs specifically in the nuclear burning core .",
    "the importance of the feed - back effect due to nuclearly - induced @xmath0-gradients was well recognized ( see mestel and moss , 1986 ) , however the feed - back effect due to the diffusion - induced @xmath0-gradients on the meridional circulation was not included until recently . in previous work on solar models , it was inferred that the rotation induced mixing becomes inefficient as soon as the @xmath0-gradient becomes larger than some critical value ( rvcd ) .",
    "this value was adjusted to obtain the lithium depletion observed and to satisfy the constraint on the @xmath69he/@xmath70he ratio .",
    "here we include a more precise treatment of the physics of diffusion - induced @xmath0-gradients and the diffusion - circulation coupling as discussed by vauclair & thado ( 2003 ) ( hereafter referred as paper i ) , thado & vauclair ( 2003a , paper ii ) and ( 2003b , paper iii ) . while the @xmath0-terms have definitely to be taken into account in the computations , the details of the coupling process which occurs when these term becomes of the same order of magnitude as the classical terms remain difficult to handle . in paper",
    "i , we introduced an analytical approach of the processes and discussed an approximate solution in a quasi - stationary case .",
    "we showed that the coupling between helium settling and rotation - induced mixing can slow down both the mixing and the settling when the @xmath0-terms are of the same order of magnitude as the other terms . in paper ii",
    ", we presented the results of a 2d numerical simulation of the considered processes which helps visualizing the situation . in the example which has been chosen",
    "( slowly rotating low mass stars ) , the @xmath0-terms become of the same order of magnitude as the classical terms in a short time scale compared to the main - sequence lifetime , thereby creating a frozen region where the circulation does not proceed anymore . however when this occurs the equilibrium between the opposite meridional currents",
    "is permanently destabilized by the helium settling below the convective zone . as a consequence",
    ", a new motion develops , which mixes up the zone polluted by diffusion . below this region",
    "the circulation remains nearly frozen .",
    "this process acts as a restoring system for the element abundance variations and increases significantly their settling time scales .",
    "we then suggested that diffusion and mixing react in such a way as to keep both the horizontal and vertical @xmath0-gradients constant in the frozen region , while they proceed freely below .",
    "macroscopic motions due to the tachocline can be introduced in the computations by adding a diffusion coefficient @xmath71 in the equation for the time evolution of the concentration of chemical species . in this case the turbulent diffusion coefficient @xmath72 which appears in equation [ transport ] must be replaced by an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath73 : @xmath74    spiegel & zahn ( 1992 ) and brun et al .",
    "( 1998b ) have obtained an exponential diffusion coefficient for @xmath71 . here",
    "the tachocline is treated as follows : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively the value of @xmath71 and the value of the radius at the base of the convective zone .",
    "@xmath78 is called the half width of the tachocline . @xmath76 and @xmath78 are free parameters . here",
    "the absolute size of the tachocline is assumed constant with time .",
    "the diffusion - circulation coupling and the tachocline described in section [ mixing ] have been introduced in the computations of solar models .",
    "the free parameters of the rotation - induced mixing are @xmath67 and @xmath66 ( or @xmath79 ) which determine the efficiency of the turbulent motions .",
    "the competition between mixing and diffusion then determine the construction of @xmath0-gradients and therefore also the strength of @xmath0-currents .",
    "in particular the @xmath0-currents strongly depend on @xmath67 which is directly related to the horizontal turbulence : a strong horizontal turbulence tends to homogenize the horizontal layers and thereby smooths the horizontal @xmath0-gradients . in this case",
    "the small induced @xmath0-currents may not be able to compensate for the @xmath52-currents and the mixing may remain very efficient during all the solar life . on the contrary",
    ", weak horizontal turbulence leads rapidly to important @xmath0-currents which may strongly reduce the mixing .    in the computations , we try to adjust the mixing free parameters to produce a mixing both :    * efficient and deep enough to smooth the diffusion - induced helium gradient below the convective zone , * weak and shallow enough to prevent beryllium from nuclear destruction in the external layers of the sun .      by analogy with the usual definition of the tachocline ( cf section [ tac ] ) we define the tachocline thickness @xmath80 as the region where the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath71 ( cf eq .",
    "[ dtacho ] ) increases from 0.08 to 0.92 of its maximum value @xmath76 . as a result",
    "the constraint on @xmath80 deduced from helioseismic observations ( @xmath81 ) leads to a constraint on @xmath78 which is : @xmath82 considering this constraint , the two free parameters of the tachocline ( @xmath78 and @xmath76 ) are adjusted to reproduce the observed solar lithium depletion without depleting beryllium . for",
    "that we will assume that lithium depletion during the pre - main - sequence is negligible .",
    "as a consequence , the deduced values for the tachocline parameters will be upper limits since lithium may be partly depleted on pre - main - sequence .",
    "the characteristics of our best model are given in table [ soltab1 ] .",
    "this model is calibrated to reproduce at the solar age the observed luminosity and radius of the sun .",

    "<S> new solar models are presented , which have been computed with the most recent physical inputs ( nuclear reaction rates , equation of state , opacities , microscopic diffusion ) . </S>",
    "<S> rotation - induced mixing has been introduced in a way which includes the feed - back effect of the @xmath0-gradient induced by helium settling . </S>",
    "<S> a parametrization of the tachocline region below the convective zone has also been added in the computations . </S>",
    "<S> the sound velocities have been computed in the models and compared to the seismic sun . </S>",
    "<S> our best model is described in some detail . besides the new physical inputs , the most important improvement concerns the computations of @xmath0-gradients during the solar evolution and their influence in slowing down rotation - induced mixing . </S>",
    "<S> this process can explain why lithium is depleted in the present sun while beryllium is not , and meanwhile why @xmath1he has not increased at the solar surface for at least 3 gyrs . </S>"
