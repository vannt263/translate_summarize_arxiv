    "_ graph coloring _ ( gc ) is one of the most representative problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization because of its practical relevance and theoretical interest .",
    "below , we present two known variants of gc .",
    "let @xmath10 be a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) , and let @xmath11 be a labeling of the vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath4 for every @xmath12 , then @xmath13 is called a _",
    "topological numbering _ of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we refer to the problem of finding the minimum number @xmath6 for which such labeling @xmath13 satisfies @xmath14 for all @xmath15 as _ topological numbering _ of dags ( tn ) .",
    "this number @xmath6 is also the size of the largest directed path in @xmath0 ( gallai theorem  @xcite ) .",
    "tn is solvable in polynomial time and generalizations of it give rise to different applications : pert / cpm problems and the buffer assignment problem for weighted rooted graphs  @xcite , and frequency assignment problems with fixed orientations  @xcite .",
    "the other variant of gc in which we are interested is _ additive coloring _ ( ac ) ,",
    "also known as lucky labeling .",
    "let @xmath16 be a graph , @xmath17 a labeling of its vertices and @xmath2 the sum of labels over all neighbors of @xmath3 in @xmath18 , i.e. ,  @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the set of neighbors of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath21 for every @xmath22 , then @xmath1 is called _ additive @xmath6-coloring _ of @xmath18 , where @xmath6 is the largest label used in @xmath1 .",
    "ac consists in finding the _ additive chromatic number _ of @xmath18 , which is defined as the least number @xmath6 for which @xmath18 has an additive @xmath6-coloring and is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "ac was first presented by czerwiski , grytczuk and zelazny  @xcite .",
    "they conjecture that @xmath24 for every graph @xmath18 , where @xmath25 is the chromatic number of @xmath18 .",
    "the problem as well as the conjecture have recently gained considerable interest  @xcite .    in particular , we proposed an exact algorithm for solving ac based on benders decomposition  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm needs to solve several instances of an `` oriented version '' of ac .",
    "let @xmath10 be a dag , @xmath17 a labeling and @xmath19 for all @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath4 for every @xmath12 , then @xmath1 is called _ topological additive @xmath6-numbering _ of @xmath0 , with @xmath6 the largest label used in @xmath1 .    unlike other coloring problems ( including ac and tn ) , a digraph may lack any topological additive numbering .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the set of digraphs that have at least one topological additive numbering .",
    "then , for @xmath27 , the _ topological additive number _ of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath8 , is defined as the least number @xmath6 for which @xmath0 has a topological additive @xmath6-numbering .",
    "we call the problem of finding this number _ topological additive numbering _ of dags ( tan ) .",
    "as far as we know , there are no references to tan in the literature .",
    "our main contribution is to address tan from a computational point of view .",
    "we first present some properties of tan , including a lower bound for @xmath8 and families of digraphs for which it is easy to exactly compute this number .",
    "we also give a linear integer programming formulation of tan and characterize when its coefficient matrix is totally unimodular . at the end , we show that the problem is @xmath9-hard even for planar bipartite digraphs .",
    "let @xmath10 be a dag with @xmath28 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath0 is connected , and its vertices are ordered so that @xmath29 holds whenever @xmath12 . as usual",
    ", @xmath30 denotes the degree of vertex @xmath15 , and @xmath31 the undirected underlying graph of @xmath0 .",
    "we first note that @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , lower bounds for the additive chromatic number also hold for the topological additive number . for instance , in  @xcite it is proved that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the size of a maximum clique of @xmath31 . however , it is possible to get a tighter bound for @xmath35 as follows .",
    "[ cotainf ] let @xmath27 , @xmath36 a clique of @xmath0 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 the smallest and largest vertices of @xmath36 respectively .",
    "then , @xmath39    we follow  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a topological additive @xmath6-numbering of @xmath0 .",
    "for each vertex @xmath40 , let @xmath41 it is clear that @xmath42 .",
    "on the other hand , for any @xmath43 such that @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 , or equivalently , @xmath46 hence , @xmath47 . since @xmath48 for all @xmath40",
    ", the values of @xmath49 must be between @xmath50 and @xmath51 . by the pigeonhole principle",
    ", we obtain @xmath52 . therefore , @xmath53 .    note",
    "that this bound is tight for @xmath27 when @xmath31 is a complete graph or a complete bipartite graph , and unlike the result given in  @xcite , larger cliques do not necessarily lead to better lower bounds .",
    "now , we analyze when a digraph has topological additive numberings .",
    "the following is a sufficient condition .",
    "[ condinfty ] let @xmath0 be a dag and @xmath54 , @xmath3 two vertices of @xmath0 such that @xmath55 . if there is a directed path from @xmath3 to @xmath54 , then @xmath56 .",
    "the previous condition is not necessary since the digraph in figure  [ contraejemplo ] does not belong to @xmath26 either .    .",
    "]    although we do not know a combinatorial characterization of @xmath26 , we now describe a polynomial - time procedure that determines whether a digraph is in @xmath26 .",
    "observe that the following integer linear program solves tan : @xmath57 we call _ ipf _ this formulation and _ lr _ its linear relaxation , i.e. ,  the linear program that comprises constraints  , and @xmath58 for all @xmath15 .",
    "if lr is infeasible , then @xmath56 .",
    "otherwise , there exists an optimal solution of lr whose components are rational numbers ; by multiplying these components by a suitable positive integer , we obtain a topological additive numbering of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , lr is feasible if , and only if , @xmath27 .",
    "since deciding whether lr is feasible can be computed in polynomial time , we conclude that :    given a dag @xmath0 , deciding whether @xmath27 is in @xmath59 .",
    "since the matrix of coefficients of a standard integer programming formulation for tn is totally unimodular for every digraph  @xcite , tn can be solved in polynomial time .",
    "it is only natural to ask which digraphs attain such a property for tan .",
    "the following result shows that tan is much harder .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected dag .",
    "the matrix of ipf is totally unimodular if , and only if , @xmath31 is a complete graph .",

    "then , @xmath60 has two non - zero coefficients in each row : one is @xmath65 and the other is @xmath66 . according to prop .  2.6 of  @xcite , @xmath67 is totally unimodular",
    ". therefore , @xmath60 is totally unimodular by prop .",
    "2.1 of  @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath68 ) suppose that @xmath31 is not a complete graph .",
    "since @xmath0 is connected , there exist @xmath69 such that @xmath54 is adjacent to @xmath3 , @xmath3 is adjacent to @xmath70 and @xmath54 is not adjacent to @xmath70 .",
    "consider first the case when @xmath12 .",
    "then , its corresponding constraint   has coefficients @xmath65 for @xmath54 and @xmath70 ( and @xmath66 for @xmath3 ) .",
    "let @xmath71 be the row index of that constraint .",
    "let @xmath72 be the submatrix of @xmath60 whose columns correspond to variables @xmath6 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and whose rows are given by @xmath71 and constraints @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "hence , @xmath77 since the determinant of @xmath72 is @xmath78 , @xmath60 is not totally unimodular .",
    "the other case , @xmath79 , inverts the sign of the first row of @xmath72 , with same conclusion .",
    "next , we present some families of digraphs where tan is solved in polynomial time .",
    "we say that a digraph @xmath0 is _",
    "@xmath80-partite _ when @xmath31 is @xmath80-partite , and @xmath0 is _ complete _ when @xmath31 is complete .",
    "we say that an @xmath80-partite digraph is _ monotone _",
    "when it can be partitioned into @xmath81 and each of the arcs in @xmath82 satisfies @xmath83 .",
    "it is easy to see that a complete @xmath80-partite digraph belongs to @xmath26 if , and only if , it is monotone . in this case , the topological additive number can be computed as follows .",

    "note that @xmath1 is a topological additive numbering if , and only if , @xmath90 for all @xmath91 , since for all @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we have @xmath95 .",
    "now , consider a labeling @xmath1 such that , for all @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 for all @xmath99 .",
    "clearly , it is a topological additive @xmath100-numbering with @xmath101 .    in order to prove that @xmath1 is optimal , and by way of contradiction ,",
    "suppose that there is a topological additive numbering @xmath102 such that @xmath103 for some @xmath104 ; moreover , assume that @xmath105 is the largest index satisfying this inequality .",
