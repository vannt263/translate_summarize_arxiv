    "the recent discovery of superconductivity @xcite in na@xmath16coo@xmath171.3h@xmath1o has aroused an active interest of solid state physicists , since this compound is regarded as a strongly correlated superconductor on a triangular lattice .",
    "for such magnetically frustrated lattices , novel superconducting ( sc ) features are expected , as compared to the celebrated cuprates on bipartite lattices . in particular",
    ", it is primarily important to determine the symmetry of its pairing potential .",
    "so far , there have been a number of experimental efforts trying to fix the pairing symmetry , e.g. measurements of nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate @xmath18 @xcite , knight shift @xcite by nmr , and by @xmath19sr @xcite . at present , however , the results of these researches are not necessarily consistent to each another ; the pairing symmetry has not yet been established .",
    "as for theory , although some studies regard multiband effects as important , @xcite many treat this issue with reduced single - band models on a triangular lattice .",
    "the single - band studies are roughly classified into two categories , namely ones applying weak - coupling techniques to hubbard - type models , like perturbation expansions @xcite , a random - phase approximation @xcite and a fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) @xcite , and ones starting with @xmath4-@xmath5-type models in the strong - coupling limit.@xcite although the weak - coupling studies took mutually different approaches for different models , they arrived at a conclusion that @xmath13-wave spin - triplet symmetries are competitive with or even dominant over @xmath9-wave spin - singlet symmetries . on the other hand for @xmath4-@xmath5-type models",
    ", it is unanimously shown that @xmath20+@xmath21-wave symmetries are widely stable against other symmetries as well as metallic states , using slave - boson mean - field approximations@xcite , which barely respect the local constraint of no double occupation , and a gutzwiller approximation@xcite , which takes account of the constraint on an average .",
    "thus , the mean - field results of the strong - coupling theories disagree with the results of the weak - coupling ones , in contrast with the case of a square lattice , where the conclusion of the @xmath20 wave has been drawn in both theories .    in this paper , we study the @xmath4-@xmath5 model on a triangular lattice , using a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method , which exactly treats the local constraint of no double occupation .",
    "our main purposes are ( i ) to determine the pairing symmetry of superconductivity within the @xmath4-@xmath5 model with this more accurate method , and ( ii ) to check the possibility of spin - triplet superconductivity in this strong - coupling model . besides the sc states , ( iii ) we consider the stability of nagaoka ferromagnetism@xcite and inhomogeneous phases .",
    "based on these calculations , we argue the propriety of modeling for cobaltates .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in  2 , the formulation used is described .",
    "sections 3 and 4 are assigned to the results and discussions on the stability of the singlet and triplet sc states , respectively . in  5 , we treat ferromagnetism and phase separation . in  6 , we recapitulate our results and address the relevance to cobaltates .",
    "a part of the present results has been reported.@xcite",
    "generally , the 3@xmath9 orbitals are split into @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals by an octahedral crystal field . in this material ,",
    "the @xmath22 orbitals of co are further split into the levels of @xmath24 @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 @xmath27 $ ] @xcite , by a shift of oxygen vertical to the coo@xmath1 layers . due to an lda calculation for na@xmath28coo@xmath1@xcite , the bands near the fermi surface [ fig .",
    "[ fig : band](b ) ] are involved in a co @xmath22 manifold [ fig .",
    "[ fig : band](a ) ] .",
    "since na@xmath16coo@xmath171.3h@xmath1o has the same structure as na@xmath28coo@xmath1 , except for the intercalation of water molecules and the sodium concentration , one may assume the conduction bands for na@xmath16coo@xmath171.3h@xmath1o are similarly formed from the @xmath22 manifold .",
    "the band which forms the large fermi surface around the @xmath29 point ( fig .",
    "[ fig : band](b ) ) has dominant @xmath24 character , whereas the band which forms the small pocket fermi surfaces on the @xmath29-k lines have mixed @xmath24 and @xmath30 character .",

    "[ fig : band](a ) the @xmath24 ( @xmath30 ) band .",

    "the electron density is larger than 1 , i.e. electron - doped case . to treat electron - doped cases in the framework of @xmath4-@xmath5-type models , namely in the electron density of @xmath50 without double occupation , we take advantage of a particle - hole transformation . thereby , an electron - doped case with @xmath51 , which corresponds to the @xmath24 band ( lower left panel of fig .",

    "so far , the majority of theoretical studies@xcite have considered that the large fermi surface around the @xmath29 point mainly contributes , whereas some papers have regarded the isolated pocket fermi surfaces or the van hove singularities as important for superconductivity .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we consider both cases , @xmath15 and @xmath31 .",
    "since the cobalt atoms in the present compound are connected through edge - shared oxygen cages , the effective value of @xmath7 is expected to be fairly small .",
    "accordingly , we principally discuss the region of small @xmath7 in this paper .",
    "we move on to the method used . to consider strongly correlated systems , more accurate treatment of the local constraint is necessary beyond the mean field level . for this purpose , a variational monte carlo ( vmc )",

    "\\(1 ) for @xmath31 , the @xmath9+@xmath10-wave state , which breaks time reversal symmetry , is dominant for @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) , but the simple @xmath9-wave state has a quite close energy to that of the @xmath9+@xmath10 wave for a similar range of @xmath6 .",
    "the stability of the superconducting state is rapidly lost , as the carrier density goes away from half filling . for @xmath84 ,",

    "\\(3 ) triplet pairing is not realized in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model , although an @xmath13-wave state becomes slightly more stable than the normal state in the special case of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where the fermi surface overlaps the van hove singularity points .",
    "these results broadly support the previous mean - field - type studies,@xcite and is consistent with the high - temperature expansion studies.@xcite now , let us check these results for the triangular @xmath4-@xmath5 model in the light of a model of na@xmath16coo@xmath171.3h@xmath1o . within the @xmath4-@xmath5 model with small @xmath7 , the range of steady superconductivity",

    "they showed using a flex approximation that the @xmath13-wave state is the most stable .",
    "thus , it is interesting to confirm whether the stabilization of the @xmath13 wave found for @xmath40 and @xmath15 in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model is connected to this weak - coupling @xmath13 wave in the hubbard model .",
    "actually , the hubbard - type model became tractable by a vmc method due to a recent improvement of the variational wave functions.@xcite    in this paper , we have used a single - band model as a first step to study the co - based oxide .",
    "however , there exists a possibility that the multiband effect plays an essential role for superconductivity.@xcite actually , recent flex and perturbation calculations @xcite performed on multi - band hubbard models yielded results of dominant @xmath13 and @xmath11 waves . here , the @xmath26 band again makes a key contribution to superconductivity . to study this effect for large @xmath136",
    "is also an interesting remaining issue .    in the connection of triplet pairing",
    ", we finally remark that the pairing symmetry of na@xmath16coo@xmath171.3h@xmath1o can be determined by the phase sensitive experiments like tunneling effect and josephson effect through the andreev bound states .",
