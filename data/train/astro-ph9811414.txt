    "numerous observations carried out over recent years have presented strong evidence that low - mass , helium white dwarf stars are the product of the evolution of certain close binary systems .",
    "indeed , low - mass white dwarfs have been detected in binary systems containing , for instance , another white dwarf ( marsh 1995 ; marsh , dhillon & duck 1995 ; marsh & duck 1996 ; moran , marsh & bragaglia 1997 ) , millisecond pulsar ( lundgren et al . 1996 ; see also backer 1998 ) or a yellow giant ( landsman et al .",
    "in particular , moran et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found the binary system wd 0957 - 666 ( consisting of two low - mass white dwarfs ) to have an orbital period of only 1.46 h , which is short enough for the binary to merge within only @xmath7 yr .",
    "very recently , edmonds et al . ( 1998 ) have reported the presence of a candidate helium white dwarf in the globular cluster ngc 6397 . on theoretical grounds , recent population models of close binaries ( iben , tutukov & yungelson 1997 ) suggest a high probability of discovering helium white dwarfs in close binaries",
    ".    detailed evolutionary models of low - mass white dwarfs may provide valuable information not only on the white dwarf itself but also on the companion object and even on the past evolution of the system ( see , for instance , burderi , king & wynn 1996 and hansen & phinney 1998a ) . in this regard ,",
    "the analysis carried out , notably by van kerkwijk , bergeron & kulkarni ( 1996 ) , is worth mentioning .",
    "indeed , from spectroscopic data inferred from its low - mass white dwarf companion combined with a theoretical mass - radius relation for the white dwarf , these authors found the mass of the pulsar psr j1012 + 5307 to be between 1.5 and 3.2 .",
    "needless to say , detailed models of helium white dwarfs , together with further observations , are needed in order to achieve a more precise determination of the pulsar mass and hence to constrain the equation of state at the high densities appropriate for neutron stars .",
    "in addition , an independent determination of the age of many millisecond pulsars can be inferred from the study of the cooling of their helium white dwarf companions , which is valuable for understanding the nature and origen of such systems .",
    "another strong motivation for constructing improved white dwarf evolutionary sequences is the fact that , thanks to the _ hubble space telescope _ , it has been possible to detect the low - luminosity tail of the white dwarf population in globular clusters .",
    "accordingly , white dwarf evolutionary tracks would provide an independent way of measuring the age and distance of such clusters ( see , e.g. , richer et al .",
    "1995 ; von hippel , gilmore & jones 1995 and renzini et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in view of these considerations",
    ", we present in this paper new grids of white dwarf evolutionary models for different hydrogen envelopes and stellar masses .",
    "the emphasis is placed mainly on low - mass , helium white dwarfs , the detailed study of which has recently began to be undertaken .",
    "as a matter of fact , althaus & benvenuto ( 1997a ) and benvenuto & althaus ( 1998 ) carried out an analysis of the structure and evolution of low - mass white dwarfs based on a updated physical description , such as new opacities and equations of state , and the employment of a new convection model more physically sound than the mixing length theory . in a still more recent study ,",
    "hansen & phinney ( 1998a ) presented evolutionary calculations for these objects as well .",
    "however , the evolutionary sequences for their more massive models do not converge to the hamada & salpeter ( 1961 ) predictions for zero - temperature , pure - helium configurations , thus resulting in models with underestimated surface gravities .",
    "this can be seen from figure 16 of hansen & phinney ( 1998a ) .",
    "note that the surface gravity for their more massive models with a hydrogen envelope of @xmath8= @xmath9 is substantially lower than the hamada - salpeter values .",
    "such a discrepancy can not be attributed to the hydrogen layer , since a thin hydrogen envelope introduces a very small correction to the stellar radius of zero - temperature , pure helium models ( see benvenuto & althaus 1998 ) .    by contrast , the study of evolution of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs have captured the interest of numerous investigators such as lamb & van horn ( 1975 ) , iben & tutukov ( 1984 ) , koester & schnberner ( 1986 ) , dantona & mazzitelli ( 1989 ) , tassoul , fontaine & winget ( 1990 ) , wood ( 1992 ) , benvenuto & althaus ( 1997 ) and althaus & benvenuto ( 1998 ) . in particular ,",
    "iben & tutukov ( 1984 ) were the first in computing evolutionary models of white dwarfs with hydrogen burning , showing that hydrogen burning in cooling white dwarfs could be an important energy source .    with the calculations that we present here we amply extend those presented in althaus & benvenuto ( 1997a ) and",
    "benvenuto & althaus ( 1998 ) , in which the effects of convection , neutrino losses and different hydrogen envelopes on the structure and evolution of helium white dwarfs were carefully analysed ( we should mention that the results shown in benvenuto & althaus 1998 correspond to a metallicity of @xmath10 0 and not to @xmath2 0.001 , as stated in that work ) .",
    "furthermore , we extend our calculations to the case of more massive carbon - oxygen white dwarfs .",
    "our grid for carbon - oxygen models is likewise very detailed , which may be of relevance in the study of , for instance , the general problem of determining the theoretical white dwarf luminosity function and the assessment of the age of the galactic disc .",
    "this subject has been recently addressed by leggett , ruiz & bergeron ( 1998 ) , who have greatly improved the determination of the observed luminosity function for cool white dwarfs . in this regard",
    ", we shall derive theoretical luminosity functions from our cooling sequences in order to compare with the leggett et al .",
    "observational data .",
    "the results presented here constitute a very detailed and updated set which will be suitable , for instance , for the interpretation of recent and forthcoming observational data about low - mass white dwarfs in close binary systems .",
    "finally , we applied our evolutionary models with helium cores to derive stellar masses of a sample of low - mass white dwarfs .",
    "the evolutionary sequences have been obtained with the same evolutionary code and input physics we employed in our previous works on white dwarf evolution , and we refer the reader to althaus & benvenuto ( 1997a , 1998 ) and benvenuto & althaus ( 1998 ) as well as to the references cited therein for details . in what follows",
    "we restrict ourselves to a few brief comments .",
    "the code has been written following the method presented by kippenhahn , weigert & hofmeister ( 1967 ) for calculating stellar evolution .",
    "in particular , to specify the surface boundary conditions we perform three envelope integrations ( at constant luminosity ) from photospheric starting values inward to a fitting mass fraction @xmath11 , where @xmath12 corresponds to the first henyey mass shell and @xmath13 is the total mass of the white dwarf model . in our code",
    "the value of @xmath12 is automatically changed over the evolution so as to keep the thickness of the envelope as small as possible .",
    "this provides an accurate description of the outer layers of our white dwarf models .",
    "the interior integration is treated according to the standard henyey technique as described by kippenhahn et al .",
    "( 1967 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     , the surface gravity ( g ) and the stellar mass ( 1 ) of the objects were taken from bergeron , saffer & liebert ( bsl ) ( 1992 ) and bragaglia , renzini & bergeron ( brb ) ( 1995 ) .",
    "the next column ( 2 ) gives the stellar mass according to our helium - core models without a hydrogen envelope and the last column lists the stellar mass according to our helium - core models with a hydrogen envelope of @xmath14 .",
    "our main motivation for the publication of a detailed set of low - mass white dwarf models like the one presented here is , apart from the fact that little attention has been paid in the past to the study of this kind of objects , that both finite - temperature effects and hydrogen envelopes substantially modify the surface gravity values of zero - temperature , helium - core - degenerate configurations .",
    "these features may turn out to be very important for the interpretation of the recent and future observational data about low - mass white dwarfs .",
    "we think that the detailed low - mass models we computed here by employing the full scheme of stellar evolution theory may help such an endeavour .",
    "@xmath15    in the context of the foregoing paragraph we show in figure   [ fig_5 ] the surface gravity @xmath16 ( in cgs units ) in terms of for some selected models . the effects of finite temperature are clearly noticeable , particularly for less massive models . as is well known , at a given more massive models are characterized by smaller radii .",
    "as decreases the model radius ( gravity ) gradually becomes smaller ( larger ) , ultimately reaching an almost constant value as expected for a strongly degenerate configuration , in which the mechanical structure is determined mainly by degenerate electron pressure . as a result ,",
    "stellar parameters asymptotically reach constant values corresponding to zero temperature configurations .",
    "note also the changes in the @xmath16 values brought about by rather thick hydrogen envelopes .",
    "another observation we can make from this figure is that , at low , convective mixing between hydrogen and helium layers increases the @xmath16 values of models with thin hydrogen envelopes .",
    "in fact , convective mixing changes the outer layer composition from a hydrogen - dominated to a helium - dominated one , thus giving rise to denser outer layers . from then on , their subsequent evolution resembles that of a white dwarf model without a hydrogen envelope , as can be noted from figure  [ fig_5 ] ( see also figure  [ fig_6 ] ) , particularly for less massive models .    to clarify better the role played by hydrogen envelopes in the @xmath16 values of low - mass models , we show in figure  [ fig_6 ] the reduction in the @xmath16 values of pure helium configurations resulting from adding hydrogen envelopes of different thickness .",
    "more precisely , we plot in terms of the quantity @xmath17 for various stellar masses and hydrogen envelopes ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for the surface gravity of a helium - core configuration of a given stellar mass without and with a hydrogen envelope , respectively ) .",
    "it is clear that thick hydrogen envelopes appreciably reduce the @xmath16 values of pure helium models . at the low of 15,000k for instance ,",
    "the @xmath16 values of the 0.35 and 0.25 pure helium models are reduced , respectively , by 20 and 30 per cent if a hydrogen envelope of @xmath20 is added . such values increase considerably at higher . at @xmath21 17,000 k",
    ", there is a change in the slope of the curves stemming from the decrease in the radiative opacity values after helium recombination .",
    "this causes pure helium models to become denser and hence to have larger @xmath16 values .",
    "@xmath22    non - negligible differences in the structure and cooling of white dwarfs may also arise from the employment of different metallicities in the envelope , particularly at low luminosities where central temperature of models becomes strongly tied to the details of the outer layer chemical stratification ( see tassoul et al .",
    "this expectation is borne out by figure  [ fig_7 ] , in which we compare the cooling times of helium white dwarf models for two extreme metallicities assumed in the envelope .",
    "when convection reaches the domain of degeneracy , the central temperature drops substantially and the star has initially an excess of internal energy to be radiated , thus giving rise to a lengthening of evolutionary times during that stage of evolution . because models with lower metallicities are characterized by deeper convection zones ( see figure  [ fig_1 ] ) , this effect occurs at higher luminosities in such models and this explains their greater ages as compared with high - metallicity models .",
    "eventually , at very low luminosities , more transparent models evolve more rapidly , as expected .",
    "we have also analysed the effect of metallicity on surface gravity for helium models ( see figure  [ fig_8 ] ) and we found that surface gravity is almost insensitive to a specific choice of metallicity in the envelope .",
    "lastly , we have applied our evolutionary models with helium cores to derive stellar masses of some selected low - mass white dwarfs . to this end , we have picked out low surface gravity white dwarfs from the sample of white dwarfs analysed by bergeron , saffer & liebert ( 1992 ) and bragaglia , renzini & bergeron ( 1995 ) , and we list the results in table 3 .",
    "the above cited authors estimated the white dwarf masses from evolutionary models with pure carbon - core composition .",
    "however , using our evolutionary models with helium cores and no hydrogen envelope we find the mass values to be appreciably underestimated , particularly at high temperatures .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the objects listed in table 3 are white dwarfs that most likely have a hydrogen envelope .",
    "this being the case , the stellar mass should be estimated from evolutionary models with hydrogen envelopes .",
    "as shown in table 3 , there is an appreciable difference in the white dwarf mass when stellar masses are derived from models with thick hydrogen envelopes ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath25    in view of the preceding considerations , we conclude that detailed models of low - mass white dwarfs such as presented in this study should be carefully taken into account , should the mass of a white dwarf be measured by applying the surface gravity - relation .",
    "this is particularly true regarding the possibility of constraining the equation of state at neutron star densities as inferred from observations of low - mass white dwarf companions to millisecond pulsars , such as those studied by van kerkwijk et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "complete tables containing the results of our calculations are available at the world wide web site http://www.fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar/@xmath26althaus/. additional evolutionary sequences are obtained upon request to the authors at their e - mail address .",
    "features such as surface luminosity , , central density and temperature , surface gravity , stellar radius , age and hydrogen surface abundance are listed in the tables .",
    "we are indebted to f. dantona for sending us the starting model , and to f. rogers for providing us with his radiative opacity data tables .",
    "we also thank t. guillot and d. saumon for their help in making available to us the low - density equation of state that we have employed here .",
    "we are also grateful to v. m. canuto for providing us with the canuto goldman & mazzittelli model before publication .",
    "we also thank our anonymous referee , whose comments greatly improved the original version of this work ."
