    "since 1935 @xcite , the quantumness of correlations has triggered philosophical and scientific debates regarding some unusual qualities of the physical world . from these discussions grew quantum information science ( qis ) @xcite , which is excitingly reverberating on several fields of scientific inquire @xcite .",
    "there are some key concepts which are very significant for this quantum revolution , among them are quantum contextuality @xcite , non - locality @xcite , steering @xcite , entanglement @xcite , discord @xcite , and coherence @xcite . understanding them and their interplay is a fundamental current problem in qis .",
    "+ although some of these quantumness measures have been indirectly related through purifications , as they are qualitatively and operationally quite distinct , at first sight there is no reason one should expect to exist a direct relation between them .",
    "+ in recent years special attention has been given to the geometric definition of quantifiers of correlations@xcite.this geometric approach requires to choose a measure of distance , which it has also been the subject of wide discussions .",
    "one specific property that is required for a measure of distance is its contractivity . in particular",
    "this feature is important because it ensures that the distance between two quantum states initially in an uncorrelated state whith its environment , does nt increase with time , which assures that the distinguishability does nt grow with time .",
    "the contractivity of the trace norm for trace - preserving quantum evolution was proved by ruskai@xcite , but for the case of the hilbert - schmidt norm osawa @xcite found one example in which this norm is not contractive .",
    "more recently , wang and schirmer @xcite demonstrated necessary and sufficient conditions for contractivity of the hilbert - schmidt norm . +",
    "indirect relations between entanglement and discord of different bipartitions of a three - partite system were obtained in the literature @xcite .",
    "however there is no straightforward reason to assume the existence of a direct relation between entanglement and discord for single bipartite system , although numerical and analytical inequalities can be found @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we will consider the possible existence of a direct relation between entanglement and discord , two of the most prominent quantum correlations .",
    "in particular we calculate for initial bell - diagonal states under the action of several local trace - preserving quantum - channels ( bit flip , bit phase flip , phase damping and depolarizing ) geometric measures for entanglement and discord and we find direct relations between them . in sec . [",
    "sec : geometricmeasurement ] we present the geometric measures of correlations and the correspondig measures of distance . in sec.[sec : entdiscbds ] we obtain the entanglement - discord relations for bell - diagonal states under the phase damping channel , using the hilbert - schmidt norm and the trace norm . in particular for the trace norm we find that our geometric measure of entanglement is equal to the concurrence of the entangled state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : entdiscdepo ] we obtain the entanglement - discord relations for bell - diagonal states under the depolarizing channel . in sec.[sec : conclusion ] we summarized and discussed our results .",
    "concerning the quantification of entanglement and discord , we choose a geometric approach in order to set both quantifiers in equal foot , strategy that allow us to find a direct relation between them .",
    "we can measure how entangled or discordant a general bipartite density operator @xmath0 is by its minimum distance to the corresponding set not possessing that property , i.e. , : @xmath1 where @xmath2 belongs to the set of separables states ( zero entanglement ) and @xmath3 to the set of classical states ( zero discord ) .",
    "+ in order to quantify entanglement and discord from a geometric approach , we choose two particular cases of the schatten @xmath4norm distance , which is defined using the @xmath5-norm : @xmath6 .",

    "bell - diagonal states ( bds ) have been the workhorse for analytical computations of most quantum correlation functions .",
    "this is helpful , for instance , in investigations of the dynamics of these correlations under decoherence @xcite , for their experimental estimation @xcite , and for more easily visualize and comprehend the geometrical structure of the quantum state space @xcite .",
    "the bell - diagonal class of states is equivalent , under local unitaries , to two - qubit states with maximally mixed marginals that can be written as follows : @xmath13 with @xmath14 denoting the @xmath15 identity operator and we defined @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the last vector is dubbed here as the correlation vector , because @xmath18 .",
    "the set \\{@xmath19 } is the usual orthonormal basis for @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the pauli matrices .",
    "+ in the following we study a two - qubit system @xmath22 prepared in the state @xmath0 with each party interacting with its own local - independent environment . thus , if the overall initial state is @xmath23 , the closed system evolved state is @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being a unitary transformation in @xmath26 , for @xmath27 .",
    "the partial trace leads then to the evolved state for the bipartite system @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath28 with the matrix elements of the kraus operators being @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are orthonormal basis for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . using that ,",
    "we obtain direct - dynamical discord - entanglement relation considering two qubits prepared in a bell - diagonal state interacting with the phase damping channel .",
    "+ the phase damping channel ( pdc ) represents the main source of decoherence in quantum systems .",

    "as was noted by @xcite for the bell diagonal states the only states with zero discord lay in the cartesian axes [ fig : bds ] , thus the discord is determined by the euclidean distance from the point @xmath44 to its closest axis . taking this into account we define the discord : @xmath45\\ ] ] where @xmath46    for the entanglement calculation we use the known result @xcite that for hermitian matrices which pertain to the same trace class , the hilbert schmidt distance between them equals the euclidean distance between their corresponding correlations vectors : @xmath47 + the region of separable states is delimitated by the octahedron @xcite defined by @xmath48 . using the symmetry of the separable states region in the bell - diagonal space [ fig : bds ]",

    "we need to find the closest separable state to a bell diagonal state .",
    "there are several proposals to determine the closest separable state , using different criterias @xcite and differents measures of distance . in what follows",
    "we use a result obtained in the context of multipartite systems @xcite that says that the closest biseparable state to a general @xmath77 state is also an @xmath77 state , and we propose the following criteria : we will search the closest separable state to an entangled x state between the x states that have the same populations that the entangled one . with this assumption",
    "we get a very meaningful result :    let @xmath78 be the density matrix associated to a quantum @xmath77 state and @xmath79 its closest separable state ( with the same populations than @xmath78 ) under the trace distance .",

    "+ the expression above reaches its minimum value when both terms are 0 , but this only happens when both matrices are equal . in the general case",
