    "a conventional space - time diagram ( std ) is a @xmath1 diagram@xcite . in general",
    "a std takes a two dimensional space and a one dimensional time to create a three dimensional diagram . a world line in a std",
    "records the positions of a particle at different time , i.e. the track of a particle .",
    "an example of a world line is shown in fig.1 , where a particle starts from position @xmath2 .",
    "a point on a world line corresponds to an event of a process .    a world line in a std satisfies the minkowski geometry , which is very different from the euclid geometry , thus to be easily misleading new learners .    the time recorded by a clock moving together with a particle",
    "is called the proper time .",
    "it is an invariant quantity under transformations of inertial references .",
    "the proper time of an infinitesimal process is defined by @xmath3 in the following equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "quantities @xmath6 are shown by a triangle in fig.1 .",
    "these quantities , however , do not satisfy the euclid geometry since they satisfy .",
    "alternatively this geometry is called the _",
    "minkowski geometry_. thus the right triangle in fig.1 is very misleading to new learners , i.e. @xmath7 is not the real length of the world line .    due to the disadvantage of the conventional std",
    "it is worthy to find a new diagram which is fully geometric to shown the world lines of particles .",
    "since in a flat space - time one has @xmath8 the proper time @xmath9 and the displacement @xmath10 sustain the two right angle edges of a right triangle , and the coordinate time @xmath11 spans the triangle as the hypotenuse .",
    "this is just the case in a @xmath12 diagram as shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is fully geometric , hence is called an _ euclid space - time diagram_(estd ) .",
    "the angle @xmath13 of the right triangle gives the speed of the particle @xmath14 _ the geometric length of a world line is exactly equal to _ @xmath15 .",
    "the time interval @xmath16 between two events @xmath17 and @xmath18 is given by @xmath19    therefore , the present estd is much more intuitive than the conventional std .",
    "[ spacetime ]     since a light ray has a zero proper time , @xmath20 , it lies on the @xmath21 plain , as shown by the dashed line in fig.2",
    ". then the light cone in the conventional std becomes a light plain ( i.e. the @xmath21 plain ) in the present estd .    for convenience , the time zero @xmath22 of any world line",
    "can be defined on the @xmath21 plain .",
    "of course this definition is reference dependent .",
    "consider a moving clock in a spacecraft starting from the origin with velocity @xmath23 .",
    "the world lines of the moving clock ( blue ) and a rest clock at the origin ( red ) in the estd are shown in fig.3(a ) . at time",
    "@xmath24 the rest clock and the moving clock arrive at a circle of radius @xmath25 .",
    "the time elapsed on the reference of the spacecraft , i.e. the proper time @xmath26 , is given by the geometry of the blue world line : @xmath27 therefore , the time elapses slower in a moving reference by a factor of @xmath28 .",
    "the is just the time dilation of a moving reference .",
    "again we see that the estd becomes much more straight forward .",
    "the twin paradox is a famous argument in the history of the theory of relativity .",
    "two twin brothers a and b were born at sanya village some years ago , but brother b was taken away by a high - speed spacecraft of a group of aliens just after he was born .",
    "today the spacecraft comes back .",
    "the two twin brothers meet at the place where there were born . according to the special theory of relativity brother b",
    "should be younger than a on view of the people of the village .",
    "on view of the aliens , however ,",
    "brother a should be younger than b since they feel that the earth relatively moves away and comes back to them . who is younger in fact ?",
    "this is the twin paradox .",
    "of course , physics has given a certain conclusion on this paradox that the view of the village people is correct since the reference of the aliens is not inertial .",
    "as shown in fig.3(b ) two twin brothers were born at @xmath29 and @xmath22 , and @xmath30 ( red ) is the world line of brother a and @xmath31 ( blue ) the world line of brother b. b traveled to a distance @xmath32 away from the earth with a constant speed @xmath33 and comes back to meet a at time @xmath24 .",
    "the world lines of the two brothers have the same lengths @xmath25 ( red and blue ) .",
    "the angle @xmath13 gives the speed of the spacecraft , @xmath34 .",
    "the proper time @xmath26 is the real time that b experienced . according to the geometry of the estd the proper time",
    "is given by @xmath35 thus brother b is younger than a. if b traveled with a higher speed , e.g. , along @xmath36 in fig.3(b ) with a longer path ( i.e. a longer time @xmath37 ) , but comes back with the same proper time @xmath26 , a would be an age of @xmath37 , further older than the former case .",
    "obviously , this analysis is much easier than the conventional std .",
    "now we consider a moving length @xmath38 in a reference frame @xmath39 with velocity @xmath23 relative to a rest frame @xmath40 as shown in fig.4 .",
    "we measure the positions of the two ends of the moving length at time @xmath22 in frame s to given the length @xmath41 ( blue bar , @xmath42 ) .",
    "this happens at different time @xmath37 in frame @xmath39 as shown .",
    "since the length is at rest in @xmath39 the two ends at any time give @xmath43 ( green bar ) .",
    "the geometry of the right triangle in the figure gives @xmath44 it is seen that a moving length looks shorter .",
    "again the estd gives intuitively a geometric picture of relativistic effects .",
    "this estd can be applied to a satellite clock ( gravity is not considered at the moment ) .",
    "a satellite is rotating around the earth .",
    "the world line of the satellite is shown in fig.5(a ) .",
    "the cylindrical surface in the diagram contains the world lines of the earth surface .",
    "the length of the world line of the satellite is equal to the height of the world line of the earth(@xmath25 ) , hence the satellite experienced shorter proper time ( @xmath45 ) . according to the right triangle relation ( [ tri ] ) of the estd one obtains the proper time for each cycle of rotations of the satellite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the period of one cycle of the satellite s rotation .",
    "another relation comes from newton s second law on the centripetal force @xmath48 , here @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the mass of the earth and the orbital radius of the satellite , respectively .",
    "then one has @xmath51    that is to say , the clock rest on a satellite goes slower by a factor of @xmath52 than a clock rest on the earth .    taking account of the spin of the earth ,",
    "compare the proper time @xmath53 elapsed on the surface of the earth and @xmath54 on the satellite in the same time interval @xmath16 as shown in fig.5(b ) .",
    "the geometry gives @xmath55 where @xmath56 are velocities of the earth s surface and the satellite .",
    "the two proper times have a relative deviation @xmath57 .",
    "this is the correction originating from the special theory of relativity .",
    "when @xmath58 is negligible to @xmath59 this result approaches to .",
    "now we consider the effect of gravity .",
    "a static and vacuum gravitational field outer of a mass @xmath49 is determined by the schwarzschild metric@xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for a circular motion of a satellite @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "thus finally one has @xmath65 this equation is similar to but a new correction from the gravity enters into the function @xmath66 in the above equation .",
    "this is the total relativistic effect of the satellite .",
    "this effect affects significantly the locating accuracy of a gps system and has to be corrected on site to the clocks on satellites .",
    "a conventional space - time diagram is @xmath0 one , which satisfies the minkowski geometry .",
    "this geometry conflict the intuition from the euclid geometry . in this work",
    "an euclid space - time diagram is proposed to describe relativistic world lines with an exact euclid geometry .",
    "the relativistic effects such as the dilation of moving clocks , the contraction of moving length , and the twin paradox can be geometrically expressed in the euclid space - time diagram .",
    "it is applied to the case of a satellite clock to correct the gravitational effect .",
