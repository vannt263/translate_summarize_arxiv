    "@xcite discovered peculiar features in the optical spectrum of ( hereon , sdss j1536 + 0441 ) , a @xmath5 radio quiet quasar .",
    "three line systems are found at different redshifts : a set of broad and narrow emission lines at @xmath5 , a set of only broad emission lines at @xmath6 and a third set of very narrow absorption lines at an intermediate redshift ( @xmath7 ) . @xcite",
    "interpreted the former two systems in terms of the broad line region emission around two massive black holes within the same galaxy , constituting a massive black hole binary ( bhb ) with sub - parsec separation .",
    "@xcite questioned the bhb scenario , ascribing the peculiar spectroscopic features of the quasar to a single active massive black hole with a particular disk - like geometry of the broad line region , similar to arp 102b .",
    "this scenario is also supported by the detection of a bump in the red wings of broad emission line profiles , at @xmath4 .    motivated by the claim by @xcite , @xcite observed sdss j1536 + 0441 using the vla , discovering two radio sources ( vla  a and vla  b ) separated by @xmath8 within the quasar optical localization region .",
    "independently , nir observations led by our group @xcite revealed the occurrence of a companion galaxy of the quasar , located in correspondence with vla  b .",
    "this was subsequently confirmed in the optical wavelengths by @xcite using hst .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that each nucleus of the two galaxies is related to a single set of broad emission lines .",
    "the validity of this picture can be tested with high angular resolution spectroscopy , in order to prove if the two sets of broad emission lines are spatially separated . @xcite and @xcite presented optical spectra of sdss j1536 + 0441 .",
    "both groups suggest that the regions responsible for the emission of the two sets of broad lines are spatially coincident .",
    "nevertheless , both observations were carried out under non - optimal seeing conditions ( larger than the angular separation of the two objects along the slit ) , hindering a clear comprehension of the contribution of the active nucleus in vla ",
    "b to the spectrum of sdss j1536 + 0441 .",
    "the scenario of a superposition of two agns has already been invoked by @xcite to explain the spectral properties of another bhb candidate ( sdss j0927 + 2943 ; see * ? ? ?",

    "in order to study the properties of this peculiar object , and to probe the presence of a rich galaxy cluster in its environment , we performed deep , high - resolution imaging in the optical and near infrared wavelengths in an eso director discretional time programme ( proposal i d : 282.b-5059 ) .    throughout the paper , we adopt a concordance cosmology with @xmath10 km / s / mpc , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",

    "hereafter , we will focus on the chip 2 image , the one overlapping onto the optical observations .    v- and @xmath1-band images were collected with the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph # 2 ( fors2 ) at the eso / vlt on may , 22 and 24 , 2009 .",

    "in order to investigate the clustering properties of the environment of this quasar , we search for galaxies in its field .",

    "the complete list consists of 200 sources detected in the v - band , 165 in @xmath1 ( 153 of which also appearing in the v - band catalogue ) and 87 in k ( 80 of which also detected in v ) .",
    "a total of 69 sources are detected in all the bands .    among them , we select galaxy candidates using the color  color diagram proposed by @xcite and adapted to our photometric system ( see figure [ fig_ccdiag ] ) .",

    "we note that , given our sensitivity limits , we expect to detect @xmath80 stars in our frame in all the bands at this galactic latitude .",
    "similarly , if we consider the number density of general field galaxies ( e.g. , from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 14 candidates brighter than our sensitivity limits are expected .",
    "this indicates that the field around the quasar is over - dense . from the galaxy templates by @xcite",

    "it is interesting to note that , out of 11 well - resolved sources in the k - band , 10 are classified as galaxies in our color selection , and 9 of them are consistent with having @xmath4 .",

    "in this letter , we presented a high - resolution , deep multi - color imaging study of the alleged binary quasar sdss j1536 + 0441 .",
    "in addition to the extended emission of the host galaxy , we detect a bright companion galaxy at @xmath2 from the quasar .",
    "the quasar and the companion are located in correspondence with two distinct radio sources observed by @xcite , showing that both galaxies host an agn .",
    "our deep images unveil the presence of a rich galaxy cluster .",
    "the existence of such a massive structure solves the apparent inconsistency between the observation of two radio sources within @xmath9 and the expected number of such pairs in the sdss catalogue , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the potential well of such a rich galaxy cluster could in principle explain the shift in redshift between the two sets of emission lines .",
    "this consideration favours a superposition picture to explain the spectrum of sdss j1536 + 0441 .    however , the red color and the faintness of the nuclear optical continuum observed in the companion galaxy suggest that its agn emission is obscured . as a consequence ,",
    "the agn of the companion galaxy should not contribute much to the broad emission lines present in the sdss spectrum , in agreement with the indications discussed in @xcite and @xcite . in this case , the two sets of broad emission lines should be emitted by the quasar , consistently with the bhb or the double peaked emitter scenarios .",
    "the external regions of the companion galaxy could also naturally explain the narrow absorption lines observed in the spectrum of sdss j1536 + 0441 , as already suggested by @xcite .",
    "the origin of the red bump in the broad line profiles reported by @xcite remains unclear both in the bhb and the superposition scenarios .",
    "the effective role of the companion in the spectrum of sdss j1536 + 0441 and of the surrounding galaxy cluster is yet to be clarified .",
    "the superposition model , where the companion emits one of the two sets of emission lines is in possible conflict with the presently available spectroscopic data .",
    "however , the discovery of a possible nucleus in source b , matched with its radio detection by @xcite , may support this picture .",
    "crucial tests for this interpretation can be derived : from uv observations of high - ionization lines ( as discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , high angular resolution optical spectroscopy and high - resolution x  ray images .",
