    "neutral hydrogen ( hi ) in the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) can exist over a range of temperatures , @xmath8  k. in the `` classic '' steady - state models of the ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , two distinct stable hi  phases co - exist in pressure equilibrium , a cold , high - density ( @xmath9 @xmath10 ) phase , the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and a warm diffuse , low - density ( @xmath11 @xmath10 ) phase , the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) . while the exact range of temperatures in the two temperature phases depends on the details of heating and cooling processes as well as the extent of self - shielding , typical models yield stable cnm temperatures of @xmath12k and stable wnm temperatures of @xmath13k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in such two - phase models , gas at intermediate temperatures is expected to be unstable and to migrate to either the cnm or the wnm phases .",
    "spectroscopy in the hi-21 cm  transition has long provided our best window on conditions in the neutral ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is well known that hi-21 cm  _ emission _ studies are sensitive to the presence of both cold and warm gas : in the optically - thin case , the observed hi-21 cm  brightness temperature is simply proportional to the total hi  column density .",
    "conversely , hi-21 cm  _ absorption _ studies are biased towards cold gas , as the hi-21 cm  optical depth is inversely proportional to the gas temperature : for a given hi  column density , it is hence far easier to detect the cnm in absorption than the wnm .",
    "such absorption studies allow one to infer the cnm temperature ( or , given the possibility of non - thermal broadening , upper limits to the cnm temperature ) from the widths of individual absorption components along a sightline . over the last few decades , a number of hi-21 cm  studies have established that the ism indeed contains gas in the expected cnm temperature range @xmath14k , consistent with theoretical expectations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high number densities in the cnm also indicate that the hi-21 cm  transition is likely to be thermalized in this phase , with the hi-21 cm  excitation temperature ( the `` spin temperature '' ) approximately equal to the kinetic temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for the wnm , the relation between the spin and kinetic temperatures is more complicated ; however , in general , the spin temperature is expected to be lower than the kinetic temperature here ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the difficulty of detecting the wnm in hi-21 cm  absorption has meant that relatively little is observationally known about physical conditions in the wnm . in recent years",
    ", two different approaches have been taken to address this issue .",
    "@xcite carried out single - dish hi-21 cm   emission - absorption studies of a number of sightlines with the arecibo telescope and modelled the resulting hi-21 cm  spectra as thermally - broadened gaussians to infer the kinetic temperature and the gas fraction in different phases along each sightline . from this",
    ", they concluded that significant fractions of the hi  lie in the thermally unstable temperature range .",
    "an alternative approach has been to use deep hi-21 cm  absorption spectroscopy of bright compact continuum sources with long baseline interferometers , to attempt to directly detect the wnm in absorption and then infer physical conditions in this phase .",
    "the hi-21 cm  absorption spectrum can then be modelled to derive conditions in the wnm . @xcite and @xcite used such interferometric studies to detect the wnm in absorption towards cygnus  a and 3c147 , by estimating the wnm spin temperature .",
    "a somewhat different approach was used by @xcite , based on high velocity resolution australia telescope compact array ( atca ) interferometric studies of two compact sources ; they used a gaussian decomposition procedure on the hi-21 cm   absorption spectrum alone and also found a significant fraction of gas to be in the unstable thermal phase ( a similar approach was followed by @xcite and @xcite in cosmologically - distant damped lyman-@xmath15 systems ) .",
    "later , @xcite obtained deep westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) absorption spectra of four targets , again aiming to detect the wnm in absorption .",
    "these authors modelled the hi-21 cm   absorption and total - power hi-21 cm  emission spectra with a spherically - symmetric isobaric two - phase model , allowing the number density and temperature to vary with radius .",
    "the primary advantage of the above interferometric hi-21 cm  absorption studies is that they resolve out the foreground hi-21 cm  emission and thus yield an uncontaminated measure of the hi-21 cm  absorption profile that traces gas in the narrow beam subtended by the compact background source .",
    "in addition , it is possible to obtain a high spectral dynamic range with modern interferometers ( with careful calibration of the instrumental passband ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allowing the possibility of detecting the wnm in absorption .",
    "we have hence begun a large project to study the neutral atomic gas in the ism through interferometric hi-21 cm  absorption studies . in this paper , we present the galactic hi-21 cm  absorption spectra towards 32 compact radio - loud quasars obtained from deep , high spectral resolution interferometric hi-21 cm  observations with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) and the wsrt .",
    "we combine these spectra ( and the spectra of @xcite ) with emission spectra on neighbouring sightlines obtained from the leiden - argentine - bonn ( lab ) survey to derive spin temperature spectra for 34 sightlines , at a velocity resolution of @xmath16  kms@xmath1 .",
    "we also present estimates of various integrated quantities along each sightline , including the hi  column density , the integrated hi-21 cm  optical depth and the spin temperature .",

    "+ @xmath18  for two sources ( b1328 + 254 , and b1328 + 307 ) , the wsrt observations were carried out with 1024 channels over a 2.5  mhz bandwidth , yielding a velocity resolution of @xmath19  kms@xmath1 .",
    "[ table : obs ]",
    "the main aim of this project was to detect the wnm in absorption and to determine its range of kinetic temperatures and the temperature distribution of neutral gas in the ism .",
    "the kinetic temperature of stable wnm in the galaxy is expected to lie in the range @xmath20k @xcite ; this corresponds to line fwhms of @xmath21  kms@xmath1 .",
    "further , the spin temperature of the wnm is expected to lie in the range @xmath22k @xcite .",
    "we hence planned the observations to detect , at @xmath23 significance , hi-21 cm   absorption with a line fwhm of 20  kms@xmath1  and a spin temperature @xmath24k .",
    "for an hi  column density of @xmath25@xmath3 , this implies a peak optical depth of @xmath26 and a spectral dynamic range of @xmath27 to 1 , at a velocity resolution of 20  kms@xmath1 .",
    "we also aimed to have our sightlines sample a large fraction of the sky , so that they sample a range of physical conditions .",
    "we targeted compact radio quasars , so that the absorption profile is obtained from a narrow pencil beam towards the radio emission .",
    "finally , the use of phase calibrators as target sources simplified the observations , ensuring that maximum time could be spent on the targets .    based on the above criteria ,",
    "our main target sample consists of the 54 very large array l - band calibrators which are unresolved in at least the very large array ( vla ) b - array ( i.e. with angular extents @xmath28 ) and which have l - band flux densities greater than 3  jy . the flux density threshold of 3  jy was used to ensure that the required dynamic range could be achieved in `` reasonable '' integration times ( @xmath29  hours ) .",
    "in addition to the above 54 calibrators , we also included a few other compact sources that are unresolved by the shorter baselines of the wsrt .",
    "the gmrt and wsrt were chosen for the observations due to their high sensitivity and the high achievable spectral dynamic range ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper , we present the spectra of a sub - sample of 32  sources , which have l - band flux densities greater than 3.5  jy .",

    "this noise has equal contributions from @xmath295 and @xmath296 , and thus allows us to determine @xmath297 , the noise due to the telescope system temperature on cold sky ( @xmath298k for the gmrt and @xmath299k for the wsrt ) .",
    "we then determine @xmath295 for each channel by scaling @xmath297 by the factor @xmath300 , using the brightness temperature measured in the lab survey . finally , for each channel , we add @xmath295 and @xmath296 in quadrature to obtain the full optical depth noise spectrum .",
    "we note , in passing , that this implicitly assumes that the fields of view of the gmrt , the wsrt and the lab telescopes are the same .",
    "while this assumption is not entirely true for the gmrt ( whose telescopes have an effective dish diameter of 35 m at 1.4  ghz , compared to the 25 m dish diameter of the others ) , this is unlikely to have a significant effect on our results .",
    "the observational results are summarized in table  [ table : results ] , whose columns contain ( 1 )  the background source name , ( 2 )  its galactic coordinates , ( 3 )  its 1.4  ghz flux density , ( 4 )  the root - mean - square optical depth noise , in off - line regions , at resolutions of @xmath301 or @xmath302  kms@xmath1  for the wsrt spectra and @xmath303  kms@xmath1  for the gmrt spectra , ( 5 )  the peak hi-21 cm  optical depth , ( 6 )  the velocity - integrated hi-21 cm  optical depth @xmath275 , in kms@xmath1 , ( 7 )  the total hi  column density n(hi ) in the optically - thin limit ( i.e. a lower limit to the true hi  column density along the sightline ) , ( 8)  the total hi  column density n(hi , iso ) in the isothermal limit @xcite , ( 9 )  the column - density - weighted harmonic mean spin temperature @xmath274 obtained using the isothermal estimate of the hi  column density , and ( 10 - 11 )  @xmath304 and @xmath305 , the velocity widths of the profile covering 90% of the integrated hi-21 cm  emission and hi-21 cm  optical depth , respectively .",
    "finally , in the case of b0438@xmath5436 , the sole source without detected hi-21 cm  absorption , the columns list the @xmath306 upper limits on @xmath307 and @xmath275 , and the @xmath306 lower limit on @xmath274 for an assumed line fwhm of 20  kms@xmath1 , after smoothing the spectrum to this resolution .    in passing , the errors on the isothermal estimate of the hi  column density n(hi , iso ) are based on the simulations of @xcite , which showed that the isothermal limit provides a good estimate of the true hi  column density with errors of @xmath308% at @xmath309 and of a factor of @xmath310 for large @xmath311 ( @xmath312% confidence intervals in both cases ) .",
    "we have hence computed the hi  column density per 1  kms@xmath1  velocity channel using three optical depth ranges : ( 1 )  for @xmath268 , we use the optically - thin limit , ( 2 )  for @xmath270 , we use the isothermal estimate , with errors of @xmath313% on the inferred n(hi , iso ) , and ( 3 )  for the few channels with @xmath314 ( on two sightlines , b0359 + 508 and b0410 + 768 ) , we use the isothermal estimate , with errors of a factor of @xmath315 on the inferred n(hi , iso ) .",
    "the hi   column densities per channel are then added together and the errors added in quadrature to get the total hi  column density along each sightline , quoted in column  ( 8) of table  [ table : results ] .",
    "as expected , the isothermal estimate of the hi  column density is somewhat larger than the optically - thin estimate only in the case of sightlines with high peak optical depth ( @xmath316 ) , whereas the difference is negligible for the majority of the sightlines .",

    "the only source with a non - detection , the maximum @xmath306 lower limit to the spin temperature is shown .",
    "it is clear that most sightlines have @xmath319  k.,height=316 ]",
    "for neutral hydrogen , two different temperatures are used to describe physical conditions in the gas : these are the kinetic temperature , @xmath320 , and the spin temperature , @xmath321 .",
    "the spin temperature is the temperature that describes the population distribution in the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of neutral hydrogen , i.e. it is defined by the boltzmann equation @xmath322 where @xmath323 and @xmath324 are the populations in , respectively , the lower and upper levels of the hi-21 cm  hyperfine transition and @xmath325 is the frequency of the hi-21 cm  line .",
    "observationally , @xmath321 is estimated by comparing the hi-21 cm  optical depth ( measured from the absorption spectrum against a compact background continuum source ) to the total hi  column density .",
    "the latter is typically obtained by measuring the hi-21 cm  brightness temperature along a neighbouring sightline . for a single homogeneous cloud , these two measurements allow one to uniquely determine the spin temperature and the hi  column density .",
    "however , a typical sightline is likely to contain a mix of gas in different temperature phases . for this general situation",
    ", it can be shown that the spin temperature derived from the above procedure for a line of sight is the column - density - weighted harmonic mean of the spin temperatures of different phases along the sightline ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as such , it does not necessarily provide specific spin temperature values for any individual phase . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the notation @xmath321 for the spin temperature of a single , isothermal cloud , and @xmath274 for the column - density - weighted harmonic mean spin temperature along any sightline .",
    "it should be noted that it is the _",
    "kinetic _ temperature that is directly predicted by the multi - phase ism models , while it is typically the _ spin _ temperature that is reported in observational studies . for example , in the case of the wnm , earlier studies have typically obtained estimates of ( or lower limits on ) the wnm spin temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is hence important to clarify that , even for a single hi  cloud , the kinetic temperature is _ not _ necessarily the same as the spin temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    for a single hi  cloud , @xmath321 is determined by a combination of collisions , the ly-@xmath15 radiation field and the radiation field near the hi-21 cm  wavelength @xcite . in the ism",
    ", the hi-21 cm  continuum radiation field generally contributes negligibly to the excitation . at high densities and in the typical ism ( i.e. far from bright uv sources ) , the collisional term dominates over the ly-@xmath15 excitation term and the spin temperature is equal to the kinetic temperature ; this is the case in the cnm .",
    "however , in the wnm , the density is not sufficiently high for the hi-21 cm  transition to be thermalized by collisions .",
    "for example , in the absence of external influences ( bright radio sources and sources of ultraviolet photons ) @xcite obtained @xmath326k for @xmath327k , for typical ism pressures .",
    "the importance of excitation by the lyman-@xmath15 in the wnm is somewhat uncertain .",
    "if the lyman-@xmath15 excitation is sufficiently intense and resonant scattering of lyman-@xmath15 radiation causes the lyman-@xmath15 colour temperature to approach the kinetic temperature @xcite , then the spin temperature would be driven to the kinetic temperature .",
    "on the other hand it is not clear that ( i )  in the three - phase mckee - ostriker model @xcite , photons from the galactic uv background penetrate sufficiently deep in the wnm and ( ii )  even if the wnm is threaded by sufficient lyman-@xmath15 radiation , the colour temperature of the lyman-@xmath15 radiation would be equal to the local kinetic temperature .",
    "@xcite suggests that it is unlikely that the sufficient amount of lyman-@xmath15 radiation penetrates the wnm to thermalize it , and that in general one would expect that @xmath321 in the wnm would be lower than @xmath328 .",
    "it thus appears reasonable to assume that @xmath329 in the cnm and that @xmath330 in the wnm .",
    "we emphasize that these statements are valid for a single homogeneous hi  cloud .",
    "next , a typical sightline contains a mix of gas at different temperatures .",
    "the fact that the inferred spin temperature for such a sightline is a column - density - weighted harmonic mean of the spin temperatures of the different phases implies that it is biased towards the cold phase .",
    "indeed , a sightline with gas equally divided between cold gas at @xmath331  k and warm gas at @xmath332  k would yield an inferred harmonic - mean spin temperature of @xmath333  k. conversely , even if 90% of the gas has @xmath332  k , while the rest has @xmath331  k , the inferred harmonic mean spin temperature would be @xmath334  k. note that 8000  k is around the upper limit to the wnm kinetic temperature and @xmath321 is expected to be less than @xmath328 in the wnm ; hence , wnm spin temperatures are expected to be significantly lower than 8000  k ( e.g. @xmath335  k in the models of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , a harmonic - mean spin temperature of @xmath336  k can only arise if almost all the gas is in the wnm .",
    "in summary , a low inferred harmonic - mean spin temperature ( @xmath337  k ) implies that @xmath338  % of the gas along the sightline is in the cnm , while a high inferred harmonic - mean spin temperature ( @xmath7  k ) implies that the gas is almost entirely in the wnm .",
    "the line - of - sight harmonic mean spin temperature values for the sources of our sample are listed in table  [ table : results ] .",
    "the lowest panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] also show the harmonic - mean spin temperature `` spectra '' for the 34 sightlines of the full interferometric sample ( i.e. including the gmrt , wsrt and atca data ) .",
    "these were obtained by smoothing the hi-21 cm  absorption spectra to the lab velocity resolution , and then obtaining the spin temperature from the relation @xmath339 .",
    "the points with errors indicate @xmath274 measurements with @xmath340 significance at a velocity resolution of @xmath318  kms@xmath1 , while the arrows indicate @xmath306 lower limits on the spin temperature .",
    "it is clear that most sightlines have @xmath274 measurements that are @xmath7  k. this is shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig : tspin ] which plots the maximum spin temperature @xmath317 detected at @xmath306 significance and the highest @xmath306 lower limit to the spin temperature on each sightline against source number ( from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "the single sightline with undetected hi-21 cm  absorption , towards b0438@xmath5436 , is shown as a @xmath306 lower limit to @xmath274 .",
    "most sightlines have @xmath319  k , indicating ( see above ) that the gas is almost entirely in the wnm ; indeed , roughly 75% of the sources have @xmath341  k.    following @xcite , a number of hi-21 cm  absorption / emission studies in the literature have attempted to make progress by comparing the optical depth @xmath311 with the spin temperature @xmath274 , to derive a relation between the two quantities .",
    "however , as emphasized by @xcite , the problem actually has three dimensions , the hi-21 cm  optical depth @xmath311 , the hi-21 cm  brightness temperature @xmath342 and the spin temperature @xmath274 .",
    "[ fig : tau - tb - ts ] provides an overview of the data in all three dimensions by plotting the hi-21 cm   optical depth versus the hi-21 cm  brightness temperature ( i.e. the two observables ) , for all the 1  kms@xmath1  velocity channels with detected hi-21 cm   emission at @xmath6 significance .",
    "different spin temperature ranges are shown in the figure in different colours : the range @xmath343  k is shown in red ( detections ) and magenta ( non - detections , with @xmath306 lower limits within this range ) , @xmath344  k  @xmath345  k in green ( detections ) and yellow ( non - detections ) , and @xmath346  k  @xmath347  k in blue ( detections ) and cyan ( non - detections ) .",
    "the first three ranges correspond , broadly ( and for a single temperature cloud ) , to the cold neutral medium , the unstable neutral medium and the warm neutral medium , respectively , using the model of @xcite to relate kinetic temperature to spin temperature .",
    "note that spin temperatures larger than @xmath348  k are not expected to be typically present even in the wnm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; only a small fraction ( @xmath264% ) of velocity channels have @xmath349  k.    it is clear from the figure that velocity channels with @xmath350  k are always detected in absorption when the optical depth detection sensitivity is @xmath351 .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the limiting brightness temperature for detectable hi-21 cm  absorption quoted by @xcite ( @xmath352  k for an optical depth detection sensitivity of @xmath353 ) .",
    "it is also apparent that there are few low or intermediate optical depth measurements ( i.e. high @xmath274 values ) at high brightness temperatures @xmath354  k , although such optical depths would have been easily detected at our sensitivity .",

    "more curious is the fact that only a small fraction of the gas at low and intermediate brightness temperatures ( @xmath355  k ) has low spin temperatures , @xmath343  k , although these would , of course , be easiest to detect .",
    "[ fig : histogram][a ] shows a histogram of the results for the above spin temperature ranges , comparing the fraction of channels with detections and non - detections of hi-21 cm  absorption at different @xmath274 ranges . for each @xmath274 range ,",

    "the red , green and blue colours indicate brightness temperatures @xmath356  k , @xmath357  k  @xmath358  k and @xmath350  k , respectively .",
    "note that the absence of hashed blue regions among the non - detections is because hi-21 cm  absorption is always detected for @xmath359  k. however , it is curious that there are no detections with @xmath343  k and @xmath356  k ; such gas would have @xmath360 which would have been easily detectable in the survey .",
    "the total hi  column density of such `` clouds '' would be only @xmath361  @xmath3 ; it is likely that such low column density clouds can not self - shield against the penetration of external ultraviolet radiation and hence contain predominantly warm gas @xcite .",
