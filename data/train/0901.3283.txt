    "@xmath13 has an exponentially decreasing upper bound .",
    "we consider only the dispersive case @xmath14 .",
    "usually the nls is studied in the continuum setting , where @xmath15 is replaced by @xmath16 and the linear term is @xmath17 .",
    "it will become evident later on why for our purposes the spatial discretization is a necessity .",
    "the nls is a hamiltonian system . to see this",
    ", we define the canonical degrees of freedom @xmath18 , @xmath1 , via @xmath19 .",
    "their hamiltonian function is obtained by substitution in @xmath20 it is easy to check that the corresponding equations of motion , @xmath21 are identical to the nls . in particular , we conclude that the energy is conserved , @xmath22 for all @xmath23 . also the @xmath24-norm is conserved , in this context also referred to as particle number @xmath25 , @xmath26 because of energy conservation law , if @xmath27 , then the cauchy problem for ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) has a unique global solution .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed information on the nls .",
    "in this work we are interested in random initial data . from a statistical physics point of view",
    "a very natural choice is to take the initial @xmath28-field to be distributed according to a gibbs measure for @xmath29 and @xmath25 , which physically means that the wave field is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "somewhat formally the gibbs measure is defined through @xmath30\\prod_x \\left[{{\\rm d}}\\bigl({{\\rm re\\,}}\\psi(x)\\bigr ) { { \\rm d}}\\bigl({{\\rm im\\,}}\\psi(x)\\bigr)\\right ] .\\ ] ] here @xmath31 is the inverse temperature and @xmath32 the chemical potential . the partition function @xmath33 is a constant chosen so that ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) is a probability measure . to properly define the gibbs measure one has to restrict ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) to some finite box @xmath34 , which yields a well - defined probability measure @xmath35 on @xmath36 .",
    "the gibbs probability measure @xmath37 on @xmath15 is then obtained in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "the existence of this limit is a well - studied problem @xcite .",
    "if @xmath3 is sufficiently small and @xmath39 sufficiently negative , then the gibbs measure @xmath37 exists .",
    "the random field @xmath40 , @xmath1 , distributed according to @xmath37 , is stationary with a rapid decay of correlations .",
    "it is also gauge invariant in the sense that @xmath41 in distribution for any @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "of course , @xmath37-almost surely it holds @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "thus one has to define solutions for the nls with initial data of infinite energy .",
    "this has been accomplished for standard anharmonic hamiltonian systems by lanford , lebowitz , and lieb @xcite , who prove existence and uniqueness under a suitable growth condition at infinity for the initial data .",
    "these arguments extend to the hamiltonian system ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) .",
    "it remains to prove that the so - defined infinite volume dynamics is well approximated by the finite volume dynamics with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "very likely such a result can be achieved using the methods developed in @xcite . for our purposes",
    "it is more convenient to circumvent the issue by proving estimates which are uniform in the volume .",
    "let us briefly comment why the more conventional continuum nls , @xmath45 is a fundamental problem of constructive quantum field theory and is known to be difficult @xcite . to establish",
    "the existence of the dynamics for such singular initial data has not even been attempted .    in the present context",
    "the most basic quantity is the stationary covariance @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes expectation with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "the existence of such a function @xmath48 follows from the translation invariance of the measure , and one would like to know its qualitative dependence on @xmath49 . for deterministic infinitely extended hamiltonian systems , such as the nls , establishing the qualitative behavior of equilibrium time correlations is known to be an extremely difficult problem with very few results available , despite intense efforts . for linear systems one has an explicit solution in fourier space , see below .",
    "but already for completely integrable systems , like the toda chain , not much is known about time correlations in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is instructive first to discuss the linear case , @xmath50 , for which purpose we introduce fourier transforms . for @xmath51",
    "let us denote its fourier transform by @xmath52 @xmath53 , and the inverse fourier transform by @xmath54 with @xmath55^d$ ] , a parametrization of the @xmath56-dimensional torus .",
    "( we will use arithmetic relations on @xmath57 .",
    "these are defined using the arithmetic induced on the torus via its definition as equivalence classes @xmath58 , _ i.e. _ , by using `` periodic boundary conditions '' . ) in particular , we set @xmath59 the function @xmath60 is the dispersion relation of our discretized linear schrdinger equation .",
    "it follows from the assumptions on @xmath61 that    @xmath62 and its periodic extension is a real analytic function .",
    "@xmath63 .    in fourier space",
    "the energy is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a formal dirac @xmath65-function , used here to simplify the notation for the convolution integral .",
    "clearly , @xmath66 .",
    "the nls after fourier transform reads @xmath67    for @xmath50 , @xmath68 is a gaussian measure with mean zero and covariance @xmath69 provided @xmath70 . under our assumptions on @xmath60",
    "the gaussian field has exponential mixing .",
    "for the time - dependent equilibrium covariance one obtains @xmath71 clearly , @xmath72 is a solution of the linear wave equation for exponentially localized initial data and thus spreads dispersively .",
    "if @xmath73 , as general heuristics the nonlinearity should induce an exponential damping of @xmath48 . the physical picture is based on excitations of wave modes which interact weakly and are damped through collisions .",
    "approximate theories have been developed in the context of phonon physics and wave turbulence , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite . to mathematically establish such a time - decay is completely out of reach , at present , whatever the choice of the nonlinear wave equation .",
    "to make some progress we will investigate here the regime of small nonlinearity , @xmath74 .",
    "the idea is not to aim for results which are valid globally in time , but rather to consider the first time scale on which the effect of the nonlinearity becomes visible . for small @xmath3 the rate of collision for two resonant waves is of order @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the nonlinearity is expected to show up on a time scale @xmath76 .",
    "this suggests to study the limit @xmath77 note that the location @xmath78 is not scaled . for this limit to exist , one has to remove the oscillating phase resulting from ( [ eq:1.12 ] ) , which on the speeded - up time scale is rapidly oscillating , of order @xmath76 .",
    "in fact , a second rapidly oscillating phase of order @xmath79 will show up , which also has to be removed . under suitable conditions on @xmath60",
    ", we will prove that @xmath80 , with the removals just mentioned , has a limit for @xmath4 , at least for @xmath81 with some suitable @xmath82 .",
    "the limit function indeed exhibits exponential damping .",
    "a similar result has been obtained a long time ago for a system of hard spheres in equilibrium and at low , but fixed , density @xcite . there",
    "the small parameter is the density rather than the strength @xmath3 of the nonlinearity .",
    "but the over - all philosophy is the same . to establish the decay of time - correlations in equilibrium at a fixed low density",
    "is an apparently very hard problem .",
    "therefore , one looks for the first time scale on which the collisions between hard spheres have a visible effect . by fiat ,",
    "hard spheres remain well localized in space , and on the time scale of interest only a finite number of collisions per particle are taken into account .",
    "in contrast , waves tend to delocalize through collisions .",
    "this is the reason why the problem under study has remained open .",
    "our resolution uses techniques totally different from @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath4 , @xmath5 with @xmath6 fixed , together with a possible rescaling of space by a factor @xmath76 , is called _ kinetic limit _ , because the limit object is governed by a kinetic type transport equation .",
    "formal derivations are discussed extensively in the literature , _",
    "e.g. _ , see @xcite . on the mathematical side , erds and yau @xcite study in great detail the linear schrdinger equation with a random potential , extended to",
    "even longer time scales in @xcite .",
    "the discretized wave equation with a random index of refraction is covered in @xcite .",
    "for nonlinear wave equations the only related study is by benedetto _",
    "@xcite on the dynamics of weakly interacting quantum particles .",
    "they transform to multipoint wigner functions , which leads to an expansion somewhat different from the one used here .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a comparison . as in our contribution ,",
    "et al_. have to analyze the asymptotics of high - dimensional oscillatory integrals .",
    "but in contrast , they have no control on the error term in the expansion .    before closing the introduction ,",
    "we owe the reader some explanations why a seemingly perturbative result requires so many pages for its proof . from the solution to ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) one can regard @xmath0 as some functional @xmath83 of the initial field @xmath28 , @xmath84 for given @xmath85 it depends only very little on those @xmath86 s for which @xmath87 . to make progress it seems necessary to first average the initial conditions over @xmath88 so that subsequently one can control the limit @xmath4 with @xmath5 , @xmath89 .",
    "such an average can be accomplished by writing @xmath83 as a power series in @xmath28 , which is done through the duhamel formula . for any @xmath90",
    "we write @xmath91 here @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 . using the product rule and the equations of motion ( [ eq:1.10 ] )",
    "yields a formula relating the @xmath96:th moment at time @xmath85 to the time - integral of a sum over @xmath97:th moments at time @xmath98 .",
    "iterating this equation leads to a ( formal ) series representation @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a sum / integral over monomials of order @xmath96 in @xmath101 and @xmath102 . since each time - derivative increases the degree of the monomial by two",
    ", we have @xmath103    the first difficulty arises from the fact that the sum in ( [ eq:1.17 ] ) does not converge absolutely for any @xmath85 . very roughly , @xmath100 is a sum of @xmath104 terms of equal size . the iterated time - integration yields a factor @xmath105",
    "however , for the approximately gaussian average the @xmath96:th moment grows also as @xmath104 . to be able to proceed one has to stop the series expansion at some large @xmath25 which depends on @xmath3 .",
    "a similar situation was encountered by erds and yau @xcite in their study of the schrdinger equation with a weak random potential .",
    "we will use the powerful erds - yau techniques as a guideline for handling the series in ( [ eq:1.17 ] ) .",
    "the stopping of the series expansion will leave a remainder term containing the full original time - evolution .",
    "erds and yau control the error term in essence by unitarity of the time - evolution . for",
    "the nls mere conservation of @xmath106 will not suffice .",
    "instead , we use stationarity of @xmath0 . in wave turbulence @xcite one",
    "is also interested in non - stationary initial measures , _",
    "e.g. _ , in gaussian measures with a covariance different from @xmath107 . for such initial data we have no idea how to control the error term , while other parts of our proof apply unaltered .",
    "the central difficulty resides in @xmath108 which is a sum of rather explicit , but high - dimensional , dimension @xmath109 , oscillatory integrals . on top , because of the @xmath65-function in ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) , the integrand is restricted to a non - trivial linear subspace . in the limit @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath89 ,",
    "only a few oscillatory integrals have a non - zero limit . summing up these leading oscillatory integrals results in the anticipated exponential damping .",
    "the major task of our paper is to discover an iterative structure in all remaining oscillatory integrals , in a way which allows for an estimate in terms of a few basic `` motives '' .",
    "each of these subleading integrals is shown to contain at least one motive whose appearance leads to an extra fractional power of @xmath3 , thereby ensuring a zero limit .    in section [ sec : finite volume ] we first give the mathematical definition of the above system in finite volume , and state in section [ sec : model ] the assumptions and main results .",
    "their connection to kinetic theory is discussed in section [ sec : link ] .",
    "the proof of the main result is contained in the remaining sections : we derive a suitable time - dependent perturbation expansion in section [ sec : graphs ] , and develop a graphical language to describe the large , but finite , number of terms in the expansion in section [ sec : diagrams ] .",
    "the analysis of the oscillatory integrals in the expansion is contained in sections [ sec : momdeltas][sec : fullypaired ] .",
    "more detailed outline of the technical structure of the proof can be found in section [ sec : structureofproof ] .",
    "the estimates are collected together and the limit of the non - zero terms is computed in section [ sec : completion ] where we complete the proof of the main theorem . in an appendix , we show that the standard nearest neighbor couplings in @xmath110 dimensions lead to dispersion relations satisfying all assumptions of the main theorem .",

    "the terms in this expansion either contain only finite moments of the initial fields , or after relying on stationarity of the initial measure , can be bounded by such moments .",
    "we will employ our assumption about the strong clustering properties of the initial measure to turn the moments into cumulants whose analysis in the fourier - space will result only in additional `` kirchhoff s rules '' on the initial time slice .",

    "here the idea is first to identify all `` motives '' which make the phase factors to vanish identically in every second time slice , while the remaining time slices are forced to have a subkinetic length due to the oscillating phases .",
    "these correspond to immediate recollisions in the language of the earlier works , and repetitions of these motives yield the leading term graphs .",
    "other graphs will be subleading either because they contain additional @xmath448-integrals , or because the @xmath448-integrals overlap in such a way that additional time slices can be proven to have a subkinetic length .",
    "as before , the overlap needs to be controlled in several different fashions to find the appropriate mechanism for decay .",
    "this results in a classification of these graphs into partially paired , nested , and crossing graphs .",
    "the control of the three different types of remainder terms can be accomplished by slight modifications of the estimates used for the main term .",

    "pairing graphs can only be treated after taking @xmath462 , and their analysis is given in section [ sec : fullypaired ] .",
    "combined , the various estimates yield the result stated in theorem [ th : main ] , as is shown in section [ sec : completion ] .",
    "in this section , we derive diagrammatic representations related to the terms in proposition [ th : qmainerr ] . for the main terms summing to @xmath463",
    "the representation describes the value of the term , whereas for the error terms , the representation is a contribution to an upper bound of the term .",
    "the representations arise since we are able to derive upper bounds which depend only on moments of the initial fields .",

    "these corrections can be controlled by relying on the strong clustering assumption , as will be described next .    given @xmath467 , we define for @xmath468 , @xmath469 , the truncated correlation function ( or a cumulant function ) in fourier - space as @xmath470^{\\rm trunc } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an immediate consequence of the gauge invariance of the measure is that @xmath471 if @xmath472 . in particular , all odd truncated correlation functions vanish . by assumption [ th : ainitcond ] , apart from @xmath473 , the functions for all other even @xmath96 have uniform bounds , latexmath:[\\ ] ] then an application of hlder s inequality with the conjugate pair @xmath1973 , reveals that the remaining integral is bounded uniformly in @xmath715 and @xmath210 .",
