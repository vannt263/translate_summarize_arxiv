    "there are several characterizations ( [ sprprop ] ) of the class of _ strongly positive recurrent _",
    "( spr ) markov shifts ; this is the class of markov shifts which most resemble finite state markov shifts .",

    "( in the constructions of this paper , the integer @xmath14 of the last condition will be zero . )",
    "it follows from ( [ mw2 ] ) that the preimage in ( [ mw1 ] ) is unique .",
    "we define two markov shifts @xmath3 and @xmath4 to be _ almost isomorphic _ if there exist another markov shift @xmath19 and injective one - block codes @xmath20 , @xmath21 each of which has a magic word ( recall that all markov shifts are understood to be irreducible ) .",
    "an almost isomorphism will induce a shift - commuting , borel bimeasurable bijection between the images of the one - block codes , and thereby will induce isomorphisms of measurable systems @xmath22 for shift - invariant borel probabilities @xmath23 which assign these images measure 1 . the collection of such measures will include the ergodic measures which give positive measure to every nonempty open set , and in the spr case will include all ergodic measures with entropy sufficiently close to the topological entropy ( defined ( [ entropydefinition ] ) as the supremum of the measure - theoretic entropies with respect to invariant borel probabilities )",
    ". these isomorphisms will be finitary ( homeomorphisms between measure - one sets ) , with exponentially fast coding time for exponentially recurrent ergodic measures ( such as the unique measure of maximal entropy , in the spr case ) .",
    "our main result ( [ maintheorem ] ) is that spr markov shifts are almost isomorphic if and only if they have the same entropy and period .",
    "this can be viewed as an analogue of the adler - marcus classification of irreducible shifts of finite type up to almost topological conjugacy by entropy and period ( [ adlermarcus ] ) .",
    "the classification beyond spr can not possibly have the same simplicity ( [ ulfremark ] ) .",
    "we also give a sufficient condition for almost isomorphism of not necessarily spr markov shifts ( [ sufficienttheorem ] ) .",
    "two systems are _ entropy conjugate _ if they are borel conjugate after restriction to sets which have full measure for all ergodic measures with entropy near the topological entropy ( see definition [ entcondef ] ) .",
    "various smooth , piecewise smooth and symbolic systems are known ( theorem [ classlist ] ) to have natural extensions which are entropy conjugate to a finite union of spr markov shifts .",
    "consequently , our main result provides simple invariants which classify the natural extensions of these systems up to entropy conjugacy ( theorem [ piecewiseclassif ] ) .",
    "one motivation of our paper is recent interest in the thermodynamic formalism for countable state markov shifts @xcite . in a companion paper @xcite",
    ", we describe a reasonable class of borel potentials which behaves well under almost isomorphism .",
    "we are also motivated by the use of countable state markov shifts to code some partially or piecewise hyperbolic systems ( @xcite and successors of @xcite ) ; investigations of coding relations among markov shifts ( see @xcite and their references ) ; and a longstanding finite state coding problem for markov measures not of maximal entropy ( [ othermarkov ] ) .",

    "this concludes the proof for the case of q.f.t .",
    "combining theorem [ classlist ] with our main result , theorem [ maintheorem ] , we obtain    [ piecewiseclassif ] a system in any of the classes listed in theorem [ classlist ] has finite entropy and only finitely many ergodic measures of maximal entropy .",

    "a topologically mixing piecewise monotonic map has a unique measure of maximal entropy , and this measure is mixing @xcite .",
    "so , in this case the invariant above simplifies to the entropy of that measure , which is the topological entropy by the variational principle @xcite .",

    "note , this result places no restriction on the relative classes of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( which can be transient , null recurrent , positive recurrent or strong positive recurrent , each independent of the other ) .",
    "our definition of `` almost isomorphism '' is analogous to the definition of `` almost conjugacy '' ; for countable state markov shifts , it seems more tractable and perhaps better suited to studying invariant measures .",
    "injective block codes between finite state markov shifts of equal entropy must be homeomorphisms , so `` almost isomorphism '' does not appear as a meaningful distinct relation in the finite state category .",
    "[ othermarkov ] the adler - marcus theorem gave good finitary codes between finite state markov shifts of equal entropy and period .",
    "by a markov chain , we will mean a markov shift together with an invariant markov measure . the subsequent search for good finitary codes between finite state markov chains has a sizeable history ( see @xcite and their references ) ; for years",

    "marcus and tuncel destroyed these hopes with their weight - per - symbol polytope invariants @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite of mouat and tuncel effectively exploits one alternate approach , using ordered algebra .",

    "we expect that the known invariants ( ratio group @xcite , weights group with distinguished coset @xcite , beta function @xcite ) of hyperbolic - structure - preserving isomorphism @xcite with finite - expected coding time will be the only obstructions to the existence of a magic word isomorphism between finite state mixing markov chains .    where we use `` irreducible markov shift '' , gurevich and savchenko @xcite use `` indecomposable symbolic markov chain '' .",
    "their use of `` symbolic '' rather than `` topological '' was to emphasize that topological issues are not always paramount .",
