    "the construction of a non - trivial quantum theory of gravitation represents one of the major open problems in theoretical physics .",
    "approaches based on perturbative methods failed due to the non - renormalizability of the underlying theory in dimensions greater than two .",
    "one possibility to deal with the quantization problem consists in discretization of space - time and quantization via the path integral , in close analogy to quantum field theory on a flat background geometry .",
    "there are two related schools attempting at a lattice theory of quantum gravity , dynamical triangulation and regge quantum gravity .",
    "we concentrate on the latter approach and refer to @xcite for an excellent review of the former framework .",
    "regge calculus is the only discretization scheme reproducing the bianchi identities of classical general relativity and is formulated exclusively in terms of the edge lengths of the lattice , independent of any coordinate system .",
    "taking advantage of the freedom in how to choose the lattice structure as well as the action , we investigate in this paper different formulations , all of them based on the original work by regge @xcite , namely standard regge calculus ( src ) @xcite , a group theoretical model ( gtm ) @xcite , and the @xmath0-regge model ( @xmath0rm ) @xcite .",
    "different to ordinary lattice gauge theory , quantum fluctuations are represented by fluctuations in the edge lengths . in particular the monte carlo method is a convenient tool for evaluating the discrete euclidean functional integral in a non - perturbative way . it was shown that within a certain range of the gravitational coupling the path integral converges to make up a well - defined phase of lattice quantum gravity .",
    "we present an extension of the phase diagram of the models in four dimensions mentioned above . due to the fact that a wick rotation from the lorentzian to the euclidean sector of quantum gravity is not feasible , in general the sign of the action in the path integral",
    "is not fixed _ a priori_.",
    "therefore we investigate the continuation of the well - defined phase into the region of negative gravitational coupling .",
    "it turns out to be terminated by a pronounced transition - like cross - over to an ill - defined phase suggesting to look for a continuum limit .",
    "in particular the @xmath0rm permits accurate investigations of the negative coupling region .",
    "further , we calculate two - point functions to probe the existence of massless quanta of the gravitational field . a candidate for a realistic quantum theory of gravity should reproduce",
    "the expected long - range interaction behavior observed in nature .",
    "any smooth @xmath4-manifold can be approximated by appropriately gluing together pieces of flat space , called @xmath4-simplices , ending up with a simplicial lattice .",
    "we take the edge lengths as the dynamical degrees of freedom and leave the triangulation of the lattice fixed . adopting the euclidean path - integral approach we may write down the partition function @xmath5e^{-i(q ) } ~,\\ ] ] with the gravitational action @xmath6 introduced in more detail below .",
    "the functional integration extends over the squared edge lengths @xmath7 of the links @xmath8 of the simplicial lattice .",
    "one of the problems with ( [ z ] ) is the ambiguity in performing the link - lengths integration .",
    "commonly the measure is written as @xmath9=\\prod_l dq_lq_l^{\\sigma-1}{\\cal f}(q ) ~,\\ ] ] with @xmath10 a function of the quadratic edge lengths being equal to one if the euclidean triangle inequalities are fulfilled and zero otherwise .",
    "the question remains whether such a local measure is sufficient at all and how the power @xmath11 might be chosen . in an effort to clarify the role of the measure",
    "the conventional definition of diffeomorphisms has been employed in the two - dimensional case , assuming that a piecewise linear space , i.e.  a regge surface , is exactly invariant under the action of the full diffeomorphism group @xcite .",
    "after a conformal gauge fixing was performed in the continuum formalism with the dewitt measure , it was shown that the evaluation of the non - local faddeev - popov determinant by using such a regge regularization leads to the usual liouville field theory results in the continuum limit .",
    "all that is based on a description of piecewise linear manifolds with deficit angles , not edge lengths , and is mostly taken as an argument that the correct measure of standard regge calculus has to be non - local . however , to our knowledge it is not obvious that this argument carries over to a discretized lagrangian , which is formulated in terms of fluctuating edge lengths , obeying triangle inequalities , and which is not invariant under the diffeomorphism group due to the presence of curvature defects :",
    "different assignments of edge lengths correspond to different physical geometries , and as a consequence there are no gauge degrees of freedom in standard regge calculus , apart from special geometries ( like flat space ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the generalization of this procedure to higher dimensions and its numerical implementation are technically demanding and some of the proposed non - local measures do not agree with their continuum counterparts in the weak field limit , which is a necessary condition for an acceptable discrete measure @xcite . but this property is fulfilled for the standard simplicial measure ( [ dq ] ) .",
    "working in euclidean space , i.e.  with positive definite metric , the conformal mode renders the four - dimensional continuum einstein - hilbert action unbounded from below .",
    "this unpleasant feature persists in the discretized regge - einstein action but need not necessarily lead to an ill - defined path integral @xcite .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations reveal the existence of a well - defined phase with finite expectation values within a certain range of the bare gravitational coupling .",
    "a lattice action for gravitation is given by @xmath12 where the first sum runs over all triangles @xmath13 with areas @xmath14 and the corresponding deficit angles @xmath15 yield the curvature elements @xmath16 .",
    "the second term extends over the volumes @xmath17 of all four - simplices @xmath18 and allows together with the cosmological constant @xmath19 to set an overall scale in the action .",
    "next we define our three different models for subsequent numerical treatment .      here",
    "we employ the regge - einstein action with @xmath20 , set the cosmological constant @xmath21 and choose the gravitational measure to be uniform , @xmath22 @xcite . in the classical continuum limit the regge action @xmath23 is equivalent to the einstein - hilbert action @xmath24",
    "if the so - called fatness @xmath25 of a 4-simplex obeys @xcite @xmath26 a lower limit @xmath27 restricts the configuration space and thus facilitates numerical simulations @xcite .      constructing the dual of a simplicial lattice",
    ", poincar transformations can be assigned to its links to yield an action in which the _ sin _ of the deficit angle enters , , and that reduces to the regge action in the small curvature limit @xcite . while in the classical continuum",
    "limit the deficit angles become small , this is in general not the case in the path - integral quantization on a finite lattice , where one has to sum over all possible discrete configurations . _ a priori _ it is hence not clear whether both src and the gtm result in the same quantum continuum theory . for comparison we again use the uniform measure with @xmath22 ,",
    "set the cosmological constant , and choose a lower limit on the fatness , @xmath27 .",
    "this model was invented in an attempt to reformulate src as the partition function of a spin system @xcite .",
    "it is defined by restricting the squared link lengths to take on only two values @xmath28 by setting @xmath29 for edges , face diagonals , body diagonals and the hyperbody diagonal of a hypercube , respectively , the link lengths are allowed to fluctuate around their flat - space values .",
    "the euclidean triangle inequalities are automatically fulfilled as long as @xmath30 and therefore @xmath31 in any case .",
    "consequently , the uniform measure in the quantum - gravity path - integral becomes identical to unity for all possible link configurations .",
    "the action can be rewritten in terms of complicated local `` spin - spin '' interactions .",
    "nevertheless , numerical simulations of the @xmath0rm become extremely efficient by implementing look - up tables and a heat - bath algorithm .",
    "computations have been performed with the parameter @xmath32 and the cosmological constant @xmath33 because ( [ q_l ] ) already fixes the average lattice volume .",
    "monte carlo simulations with at least 50k sweeps for each value of the coupling @xmath34 have been performed on regularly triangulated hypercubic lattices with toroidal topology and @xmath35 vertices .",
    "we measured expectation values of the average link length @xmath36 ( @xmath37 denotes the total number of links ) and the average curvature @xmath38 within the models described above .",
    "let us first concentrate on src , cf .",
    "figures [ qfigs]a and [ rfigs]a .",
    "the expectation values of the average link length change only slightly , increase near @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and become arbitrarily large for @xmath41 and @xmath42 indicating the emergence of an ill - defined phase with spike - like structures .",
    "the expectation value of the average curvature is negative in the well - defined phase , but @xmath43 becomes very large in the ill - defined phase where simplices collapse into degenerate configurations with long links and small volumes .",
    "the coupling of su(2)-gauge theory to src was examined in @xcite and turns out to have little influence on the gravitational phase diagram .",
    "the gtm behaves very similar , see figures [ qfigs]b and [ rfigs]b .",
    "again expectation values are finite and well - defined only in a certain coupling region between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "in contrast to the regge model the curvature @xmath46 is mostly positive in this coupling interval .",
    "however , as long as we deal with non - renormalized entities it is not clear whether the observed differences in the phase structure are physically significant .",
    "although src and gtm have the same classical continuum limit , it is necessary to demonstrate that they coincide in their critical properties in order to have the same quantum continuum limit .",
    "the @xmath0rm is always well - defined because ( [ q_l ] ) limits the link lengths _ a priori _ , cf .",
    "figures [ qfigs]c and [ rfigs]c . the lattice freezes , forming characteristic configurations where the systems with continuously varying edge lengths become ill - defined .",
    "such a model is of course better suited for investigations of the phase boundaries which here occur at @xmath47 and @xmath48 . while the transition at @xmath49 is quite clearly of first order , the behavior at @xmath50 is more subtle and",
    "will be discussed in some detail below in section  [ sec_phase ] .",
    "different to src and the gtm the four kinds of links in the @xmath0rm are not equivalent by definition ( [ q_l ] ) .",
    "this is reflected in the corresponding average link lengths @xmath51 in a single configuration , see figure [ qlfigs ] .",
    "thus we can examine their respective influence on the phase transitions .",
    "for example the hyperbody diagonal shows a considerable discontinuity at @xmath49 and exactly this diagonal was identified from weak - field calculations of regge gravity to belong to the ( five ) spurious metric degrees of freedom @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to clarify whether physical and spurious degrees of freedom decouple as predicted from weak - field regge theory .",
    "a simulation of the @xmath0rm with the hyperbody diagonal fixed results in unchanged order of the transition but in slightly shifted values of the critical couplings .",
    "an intriguing question remains : to what extent are the ( ten ) physical degrees of freedom responsible for ( the order of ) the phase transitions ?",
    "a related issue was investigated in @xcite using the src on general , non - regular triangulations of the four - torus .",
    "also there , even with additional higher - order terms in the action , the phase transition is influenced by the local coordination numbers .",
    "one important feature of a physically relevant theory of quantum gravity should be the existence of a massless graviton .",
    "the gravitational weak - field propagator can be cast into a spin - zero and a spin - two part @xcite , with the latter written in terms of connected curvature - curvature correlations , @xmath52 the local operators should be measured at two vertices @xmath53 and @xmath54 separated by the geodesic distance @xmath4 , which we take to be equal to the index distance along the main axes of the skeleton . this seems a reasonable approximation in the well - defined phase with its small average curvature . in general",
    "one expects for ( [ gr ] ) at large distances the functional form @xmath55 a power law with @xmath56 and a vanishing effective mass @xmath57 would hint at gravity with massless gravitons .",
    "indeed this was found in @xcite for src with higher - order curvature terms at some positive critical coupling .",
    "in contrast to that , fast decaying exponentials were reported for ( [ gr ] ) and also for volume correlations in the case of src at @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "we now compare src and gtm ( on @xmath58 lattices ) with @xmath0rm ( on @xmath59 lattice ) @xcite .",
    "the gravitational couplings were chosen close to the negative critical coupling @xmath50 where there is a chance for a continuous phase transition and thus a continuum limit .",
    "figure [ figr ] displays our monte carlo data for the two - point functions ( [ gr ] ) .",
    "we took only distances @xmath60 into account because @xmath61 is plagued by lattice artifacts due to contact terms . in order to test whether ( [ gr ] ) obeys a power law we fixed @xmath56 and fitted the effective masses @xmath62 , cf .",
    "table [ tab2 ] . for src @xmath62 remains rather constant towards the critical coupling whereas in the gtm the mass decreases for @xmath63 .",
    "however for all fits the uncertainties in the mass parameters are large allowing even for @xmath57 . for both the @xmath0rm and the gtm",
    ", power - law fits to ( [ g ] ) are compatible with vanishing effective mass @xmath62 .",
    "also for src an algebraic decay is compatible but , due to the large uncertainties , obviously no definite conclusion can be drawn here .",
    "* .[tab2 ] effective masses @xmath62 of the curvature two - point function @xmath64 for gravitational couplings close to @xmath50 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the discrete regge model @xmath0rm  like full regge theory  exhibits two phase transitions @xcite .",
    "one is located at a negative value and the other one at a positive value of the bare gravitational coupling .",
    "although earlier work concentrated on the latter transition  @xcite , there is no reason for favoring a positive value of @xmath34 over a negative one due to the wick rotation problem mentioned in the introduction . in the vicinity of the transition at positive @xmath34 ,",
    "histograms , e.g.  of @xmath65 @xcite , clearly show a two - peak structure , see figure  [ his ] .",
    "the two phases coexist and tunnelling from one phase to the other and back takes place .",
    "the system also exhibits a hysteresis ; the transition occurs at a larger value of @xmath34 if the simulation is started from a configuration in the well - defined phase than it does if the calculation is started from a `` frozen '' configuration .",
    "given all these pieces of evidence , we conjecture that the transition at @xmath66 is of first order .    to determine the order of the transition at negative @xmath34 we employed in ref .",
    "@xcite histogram techniques and used the binder  challa  landau ( bcl ) cumulant criterion @xcite .",
    "the bcl cumulant is defined as @xmath67 , with @xmath68 being the action of the system under consideration .",
    "it was evaluated for @xmath69 on different lattice sizes with @xmath70 to @xmath71 vertices per direction , simulating the system at several values of the bare coupling @xmath34 with high statistics ( using always @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) . for the bcl cumulant",
    "a trend towards 2/3 was observed and all histograms showed a clear one - peak structure , cf .",
    "@xcite . in our recent monte carlo simulations",
    "@xcite we typically generated @xmath72 iterations , and recorded for every run the time series of the energy density @xmath73 and the magnetization density @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the lattice size .",
    "to obtain results for the various observables @xmath76 at values of the bare gravitational coupling @xmath34 in an interval around the simulation point @xmath77 , the reweighting method  @xcite was applied . by this",
    "means we can compute the specific heat , @xmath78 and the ( finite lattice ) susceptibility , @xmath79 in a certain @xmath34-range around the simulation point .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the finite - size scaling ( fss ) of the maxima of the specific heat @xmath80 and the susceptibility @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "while the behavior of @xmath80 could still be explained as critical scaling with a negative exponent @xmath82 , the flattening of @xmath81 as @xmath83 increases is quite unusual for a second - order transition and should rather be taken as an indication for a cross - over regime .",
    "another feature of the system can be seen in figure  [ fig2 ] depicting the critical gravitational coupling , as determined from the specific - heat maxima @xmath80 and the susceptibility maxima @xmath81 . in the case of a second - order transition",
    "the extrapolations of all pseudo - transition points lead to one infinite - volume critical value .",
    "this seems to be violated in the four - dimensional discrete regge model and thus again favors the interpretation as a cross - over phenomenon over a true , thermodynamically defined phase transition .",
    "we explored the complete phase structure of three different formulations of lattice quantum gravity in four dimensions including the region of negative gravitational couplings  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative resemblance of the results from simulations of the @xmath0-regge model to those with continuously varying edge lengths is particularly remarkable .",
    "we computed two - point functions close to the critical bare gravitational coupling in the negative coupling regime . in the case of the group theoretical model as well as for the @xmath0-regge model we found some evidence for long - range correlations corresponding to massless gravitons .",
    "eventually , if there is universality between src , gtm , and @xmath0rm , the same results for physical quantities are to be expected in the continuum limit .    in the present analysis of the scaling of the maxima of the specific heat and susceptibility we found evidence for a cross - over regime in the four - dimensional discrete regge model of quantum gravity in the negative coupling region  @xcite .",
    "if this can be substantiated by further investigations and also for the regge theory with continuous link lengths , the existence of a continuum limit at negative bare gravitational coupling is questionable .",
