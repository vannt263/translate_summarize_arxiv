    "understanding the origin of fermion masses and mixing angles is one of most important issues in particle physics .",
    "their experimental values show the hierarchical structure . within the framework of the standard model and its extensions , fermion masses",
    "are obtained through yukawa couplings between fermions and higgs fields .",
    "yukawa couplings seem naturally of @xmath2 in a sense . from this viewpoint ,",
    "how to derive suppressed yukawa couplings is a key - point for understanding hierarchical structure among fermion masses and mixing angles .",
    "superstring theory is a promising candidate for unified theory including gravity .",
    "thus , it is important to study which type of flavor structure can be derived in superstring theory .",
    "superstring theory predicts the existence of 6d compact space in addition to our 4d spacetime .",
    "indeed , the 6d compact space is the origin of the flavor structure , that is , the flavor structures , which is derived from string models , are determined by geometrical aspects of the 6d compact space .",
    "several types of string models have been proposed so far .",
    "recently , intersecting d - brane models have been studied extensively .",
    "( see for essential idea on model building refs.@xcite . ) in this class of models , matter fields as well as higgs fields correspond to open string modes at intersecting points between different d - branes , and those are localized modes @xcite .",
    "thus , yukawa couplings among fermions and higgs fields depend on distance of their intersecting points . suppressed yukawa couplings can be realized when intersecting points corresponding to matter fermions and higgs fields are far each other .",
    "that is one of phenomenologically interesting aspects in intersecting d - brane models .",
    "such behavior is qualitatively the same as one in heterotic orbifold models . in general ,",
    "an orbifold has fixed points on the 6d compact space , and heterotic orbifold models have twisted string modes , which are localized at orbifold fixed points .",
    "yukawa couplings can be suppressed when matter fermions and higgs fields correspond to different fixed points .",
    "indeed , the same technique of conformal field theory ( cft ) is used to calculate magnitudes of yukawa couplings in both heterotic orbifold models @xcite and intersecting d - brane models @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "understanding the origin of suppressed yukawa couplings is the first important step to derive realistic yukawa matrices , but that is not sufficient to realize experimental values .",
    "derivation of realistic yukawa matrices in string models is quite non - trivial .",
    "another important point is to study stringy selection rules for allowed yukawa couplings .",
    "then we would see a pattern of yukawa matrices in a model .",
    "in heterotic orbifold models , allowed yukawa couplings are determined by the 6d space group selection rule @xcite as well as @xmath3-momentum conservation and gauge invariance .",
    "the space group selection rule is the selection rule for allowed yukawa couplings due to the 6d orbifold geometry .",
    "that is quite non - trivial , that is , in some types of yukawa couplings on orbifolds only diagonal couplings are allowed , but for certain types of yukawa couplings on non - prime orbifolds off - diagonal couplings are also allowed . here",
    "the diagonal couplings mean the case that when we choose two states , the other state to be allowed to couple is determined uniquely .",
    "the off - diagonal couplings correspond to the case that the third states are not uniquely determined . obviously , off - diagonal yukawa couplings are important to realize non - vanishing mixing angles in the case with the minimal and small numbers of higgs fields . actually , the number of possible 6d orbifolds is finite as determined by 6d crystallographic space groups , and the number of fixed points on an orbifold is also finite .",
    "the explicit results for allowed yukawa couplings due to the space group selection rule are shown in @xcite .",
    "then , in principle systematic study is possible to classify which patterns of yukawa matrices can be obtained within the framework of heterotic orbifold models . indeed such analysis has been done for @xmath4 orbifold models in @xcite showing interesting results for the quark and lepton sectors .    on the other hand ,",
    "patterns of yukawa matrices have been calculated model by model explicitly within the framework of intersecting d - brane models so far .",
    "although explicit models with phenomenologically interesting aspects other than yukawa matrices have been constructed so far , it is still a challenging issue to lead non - trivial yukawa matrices .",
    "thus , our purpose is to study systematically flavor structure which can be derived from intersecting d - brane models , and classify possible patterns of yukawa matrices . for such purpose ,",
    "we formulate selection rule for allowed yukawa couplings in generic case .",
    "in particular , we are interested in formulating the selection rule , which is useful to investigate whether off - diagonal couplings are allowed or not .",
    "indeed , the selection rule for allowed three - point couplings has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will formulate the coupling selection rule in a different approach . that is similar to the space group selection rule in heterotic orbifold models , showing the condition for off - diagonal couplings .",
    "then we study which types of flavor structure can appear from intersecting d - brane configurations .",
    "here we concentrate intersecting d6-brane systems ( as well as d4-brane systems ) in type iia string theory .",
    "since their t - duals correspond to magnetized d - brane systems in type iib string theory , the following discussions would be applicable to magnetized d - brane systems in type iib string theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review briefly the space group selection rule in heterotic orbifold models . in section 3 , we study the selection rule in intersecting d - brane models . in section 4 ,",
    "we consider which types of flavor structure can appear from intersecting d - brane configurations . in subsection 4.1",
    "we discuss the flavor structure , that the numbers of left - handed and right - handed quarks are the same on a @xmath5 . in this case",
    ", we show the minimum number of higgs fields is the same as the flavor number @xmath6 , and the higgs number is generically equal to @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "the selection rule is controlled by a discrete abelian symmetry . in subsection 4.2",
    ", we discuss generic flavor structure , that is , the asymmetric flavor structure . in that case",
    ", the coupling selection rule is also determined by a discrete abelian symmetry . for the minimal number of higgs field ,",
    "we also show yukawa matrices are non - trivial , but lead to a certain number of massless fermions , and diagonal entries are larger than off - diagonal entries . in section 4.3",
    ", we comment on how to reduce the flavor and higgs numbers , and that would be important to obtain non - trivial fermion mass matrices .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusion and discussion . in appendix",
    "a , we give a simple recipe : how to obtain shift vectors , which play an important role on description of independent intersecting points and formulation of the coupling selection rule . in appendix b",
    ", we discuss the possible number of higgs fields when the flavor number of both left- and right - handed quarks on a @xmath5 is equal to two .",

    "an orbifold is obtained by dividing a torus @xmath9 by a twist @xmath10 , while @xmath9 is a division of @xmath11 by a lattice @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 , where the twist @xmath10 must be automorphism of the lattice @xmath12 . on such orbifold",
    ", there are closed strings , which satisfy the following twisted boundary condition , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a shift vector on the torus lattice @xmath12 .",
    "these are refereed as the @xmath16 twisted string .",
    "their zero - modes @xmath17 also satisfy the same boundary condition , @xmath18 that is the fixed point on the orbifold .",
    "the fixed point @xmath17 is denoted by the corresponding space group element @xmath19 .",
    "the product of two space group elements , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , is obtained as @xmath22 indeed , this product of space group elements correspond to the combination of two twisted strings with the twisted boundary conditions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    as said above , the fixed point and twisted string",
    "are denoted by the corresponding space group element @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , it is remarkable that the fixed point @xmath17 is equivalent to @xmath23 on the torus .",
    "that implies that the space group @xmath19 is equivalent to @xmath24 , that is , these belong to the same conjugacy class .",
    "thus , independent fixed points are defined up to the conjugacy classes .    here",
    "we give two examples .",
    "one is the 2d @xmath25 orbifold , and the other is the 2d @xmath4 orbifold .",
    "the 2d @xmath4 orbifold is obtained as a division of @xmath26 by the @xmath27 root lattice @xmath28 and its @xmath25 automorphism @xmath10 . here",
    "we denote the two simple roots of @xmath28 by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and these are transformed under @xmath10 as @xmath31 the lattice @xmath32 is spanned e.g. by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the three independent fixed points are denoted by @xmath35    similarly , fixed points on the 2d @xmath4 orbifold are obtained .",
    "the 2d @xmath4 orbifold is obtained as a division of @xmath26 by the @xmath27 lattice @xmath28 and the @xmath4 twist , which transforms the @xmath27 simple roots as @xmath36 thus , we obtain @xmath37 , that is , we have only one independent fixed point under @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath38 the @xmath39 twist of @xmath4 is nothing but the @xmath25 twist . hence , the @xmath39 twist has three independent fixed points , @xmath40 furthermore , the @xmath41 twist of @xmath4 is the @xmath42 twist , and the lattice @xmath43 is spanned by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the four independent fixed points are denoted as @xmath46    similarly , we can obtain fixed points on other orbifolds , and the twisted strings also correspond to those fixed points .- eigenstates @xcite .",
    "however , that is irrelevant to intersecting d - brane models . ] in the next subsection , we show the space group selection rule for these twisted strings .      in this subsection , we give a brief review on the space group selection rule for allowed yukawa couplings . here",
    "we consider the condition that three twisted strings with the boundary conditions @xmath47 for @xmath48 are allowed to couple .",
    "the coupling condition due to the space group invariance is denoted as follows , @xmath49 simply , that implies the coupling is allowed when the three twisted strings combine into an untwisted closed string , which can shrink .",
    "however , here we recall that each space group element @xmath47 is equivalent to @xmath50 .",
    "this equivalence in the conjugacy class has an important meaning , as shown below in explicit models .",
    "the space group selection rule includes the point group selection rule , and the latter requires the product @xmath51 to be identity .",
    "here we examine the space group selection rule for the two explicit models , the 2d @xmath25 orbifold model and the 2d @xmath4 orbifold model .",
    "first , let us consider the 2d @xmath25 orbifold models .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection , there are three independent fixed points on the 2d @xmath25 orbifold , @xmath52 ) with @xmath53 .",
    "let us consider the coupling of three twisted strings corresponding to fixed points , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the space group selection rule requires @xmath57 up to the conjugacy classes , and leads the following condition for allowed yukawa couplings , @xmath58 that implies that the couplings are allowed only two cases , 1 ) the case that all of three fixed points are the same , and 2 ) the case that all of three fixed points are different each other .",
    "namely , these are diagonal couplings .",
    "indeed , this coupling selection rule can be understood as the @xmath25 symmetry .",
    "similarly , we examine the space group selection rule on the 2d @xmath4 orbifold .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection , there are three twisted sectors , @xmath10-twisted , @xmath39-twisted and @xmath41-twisted sectors . for example , let us consider the couplings among @xmath10-twisted , @xmath39-twisted and @xmath41-twisted sectors .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection , the @xmath10-twisted , @xmath39-twisted and @xmath41-twisted sectors have one , three and four independent fixed points , which are denoted by @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , where @xmath53 and @xmath62 .",
    "now , we examine the condition for allowed yukawa couplings due to the space group invariance , that is , @xmath63 where the space group elements are defined up to the conjugacy classes . _",
    "the important point is that @xmath64 . as a result",
    ", the couplings among all of the twisted states are allowed , and off - diagonal couplings are allowed . _",
    "that makes it clear the situation that off - diagonal couplings are allowed , that is , when two or more independent fixed points under a twisted sector belong to the same conjugacy class in different twisted sector , off - diagonal couplings among corresponding twisted states are allowed .",
    "the extension to the selection rule for generic @xmath65-point couplings is straightforward , that is , @xmath66 for @xmath65 twisted strings with the boundary conditions , @xmath47 up to @xmath67 .",
    "here we study the coupling selection rule for intersecting d - brane models .",
    "we concentrate intersecting d6-brane systems ( as well as d4-brane systems ) in type iia string theory .",
    "since their t - duals may correspond to magnetized d - branes in type iib string theory , the following discussions would be applicable to magnetized d - brane systems in type iib string theory .",
    "we consider @xmath68 as the 6d compact space , and the d6-branes , which wrap one - cycle on each @xmath5 .",
    "other backgrounds could be studied in a similar way , e.g. orientifold cases .",
    "the @xmath69-th torus lattice @xmath70 is spanned by the basis @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the configuration of @xmath72-brane is described by its winding numbers for the @xmath69-th torus , @xmath73 along @xmath74 and @xmath75 . here",
    "we take @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "denotes the greatest common divisor of the integers @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "] namely , we consider the case that the vector @xmath80 is the shortest vector on the lattice @xmath70 along its direction .",
    "a gauge multiplet appears on each set of d - branes .",
    "the gauge group @xmath81 is obtained from @xmath82 d - branes .",
    "now , let us consider two sets of d - branes , @xmath72-brane and @xmath83-brane , which intersect each other .",
    "their intersecting number on the @xmath69-th @xmath5 is given as @xmath84 and the total intersecting number on the 6d compact space is obtained as their product , i.e. @xmath85 .",
    "at these intersecting points , there appear open strings , one of whose ends is on the @xmath72-brane and the other is on the @xmath83-brane .",
    "such open strings can correspond to massless chiral matter fields , which have nontrivial representations under both gauge groups corresponding to @xmath72 and @xmath83 branes , that is , such massless modes have bi - fundamental representations @xmath86 under @xmath87 for positive intersecting numbers .",
    "the different signs of @xmath88 correspond to charge conjugated modes , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "thus , chiral matter fields correspond to localized modes around intersecting points .",
    "higgs fields also correspond to such modes . here and",
    "hereafter we assume d - brane configurations with 4d n=1 supersymmetry , because non - supersymmetric configurations are usually unstable .",
    "preserving supersymmetry requires certain conditions for intersecting angles , but that is irrelevant to our discussions .    here , we study coupling selection rule among such open strings stretching different d - branes around intersecting points . in heterotic orbifold models , the key - point for the coupling selection rule",
    "is description of boundary conditions of twisted strings ( [ twist - bc ] ) , that is , space group elements and their conjugacy classes .",
    "thus , let us study first how to describe boundary conditions of open strings around intersecting points .",
    "our setup is as follows .",
    "we concentrate a @xmath5 among @xmath90 , e.g. the first torus , because extension to the case with @xmath90 is simple .",
    "then we consider two sets of d - branes , @xmath72 and @xmath83 , whose winding numbers on the first @xmath5 are obtained as the following vectors on the torus lattice @xmath91 , @xmath92 their intersecting number on the first @xmath5 is @xmath93 .",
    "we assume the nontrivial case , i.e. , @xmath94 , and furthermore we take @xmath95 , because the case with @xmath96 can be studied in the same way .",
    "one of their intersecting points are taken as the origin of the torus lattice @xmath91 .    obviously ,",
    "all of intersecting points sit along the @xmath72 brane , that is , those positions are written as @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "note that the @xmath83 brane corresponding to @xmath99 passes the origin of the torus lattice , but the other @xmath83 branes corresponding to @xmath100 do not .",
    "on the other hand , all of intersecting points sit along @xmath83 brane , and those positions are written as @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "the former and the latter sets of independent intersecting points are equivalent each other on @xmath5 . the equivalence on @xmath5 implies the following relation , @xmath103 for proper combinations of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a shift vector on the torus lattice .",
    "thus , the shift vectors @xmath106 can be used to describe independent intersecting points .",

    "therefore , independent intersecting points and the coset representatives corresponding to @xmath113 can be described by shift vectors @xmath106 up to @xmath127 .",
    "see appendix a , where a simple recipe how to obtain shift vectors @xmath106 for generic winding numbers is given .",
    "= 0.3    the above simple example also clarifies a concrete implication of shift vectors @xmath106 for open strings .",
    "let us consider the open string at the intersecting point @xmath128 between @xmath72 and @xmath83 branes , and move it such that one end sits on the origin of the torus lattice like fig .",
    "2 . the other end can not sit on the origin , but on the @xmath83 brane , which passes @xmath129 , that is nothing but the corresponding shift vector @xmath106 .",
    "the same is true for the other intersecting points .",
    "thus , we can describe open strings at different intersecting points by the following equations , which are satisfied by string end points , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , @xmath132 when we move one of end points to the same point , e.g. the origin .",
    "it is also true for generic case , that is , independent intersecting points are represented by shift vectors @xmath133 up to @xmath134 , and end points of @xmath72-@xmath83 open string at the intersecting point satisfy eq.([open - bc ] ) .",
    "= 0.3    now we are ready to study the coupling selection rule in intersecting d - brane models .",
    "we consider three sets of d - branes , @xmath72 , @xmath83 and @xmath135 , with the following winding numbers , @xmath136 here we do not consider the trivial case that one of @xmath93 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 vanishes .",

    "that leads to the fact that the combination among the sublattices @xmath179 and @xmath142 corresponds to the torus lattice @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath180 .",
    "that implies that all of couplings are allowed for any d - brane configuration with eq.([co - prime ] ) , and that has been shown already in @xcite through a different approach .",
    "this rule will be extended into generic case when we find generic d - brane configurations in subsection 4.2 .",
    "the extension to the selection rule for generic @xmath65-point couplings is straightforward .",
    "we consider @xmath65 sets of @xmath191 branes for @xmath192 .",
    "such setup may include open strings at intersecting points between @xmath191 and @xmath193 branes as well as open strings between @xmath194 and @xmath195 branes .",
    "their intersecting points are described by shift vectors @xmath196 as well as @xmath197 .",
    "then , the condition for allowed couplings is written as @xmath198 here , recall that the shift vectors @xmath196 are defined up to the lattice @xmath199 , whose definition is the same as @xmath134 .",
    "finally we comment on the coupling selection rule due to the @xmath3-momentum conservation . within the bosonized formulation , the ( twisted ) rns",
    "fermionic strings are written as @xmath200 where @xmath201 are 2d bosonized fields and @xmath202 are the so - called @xmath3-momenta . if @xmath203 , massless space - time spinors corresponding to r modes and massless space - time scalars corresponding to ns modes have the following @xmath3-momenta @xmath204 respectively , where @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) denotes the intersecting angle on the @xmath69-th @xmath5 between @xmath72 and @xmath83 branes .",
    "now , let us consider the @xmath3-momentum conservation for yukawa couplings among two fermions and a single scalar field , which are originated from @xmath72-@xmath83 , @xmath83-@xmath135 and @xmath135-@xmath72 open strings .",
    "the @xmath3-momentum conservation requires that @xmath207 that implies that the sum of exterior angles of triangle must be equal to @xmath208 .",
    "obviously , that is satisfied with a closed triangle .",
    "however , if one of intersecting numbers , e.g. @xmath93 , is negative , the massless mode has the @xmath3-momentum opposite to eq.([h - momenta ] ) . in this case",
    ", the @xmath3-momentum conservation must not be satisfied with a closed triangle configuration of @xmath169-branes .",
    "moreover , if all of intersecting numbers are negative , the @xmath3-momentum conservation is satisfied with a closed triangle configuration of d - branes .",
    "thus , the @xmath3-momentum conservation is satisfied only when all of intersecting numbers , @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 , have the same sign on each @xmath69-th @xmath5 . that includes the condition that all of total intersecting numbers , @xmath88 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 , must have the same sign .",
    "since that means the corresponding yukawa couplings are @xmath214 type or its conjugate , the condition due to @xmath3-momentum conservation includes the condition that the yukawa couplings must be gauge invariant .",
    "in this section , we study systematically flavor structures , which can appear from intersecting d - brane configurations .",
    "the flavor structure on @xmath90 is a direct product of the flavor structure on each @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we mainly investigate the flavor structures from intersecting d - brane configurations on each @xmath5 . in subsection 4.1 , we study the symmetric flavor structure , that is , the intersecting numbers for left and right - handed quarks are the same on @xmath5 . in subsection 4.2 , we study the asymmetric flavor structure , that is , the intersecting numbers for left and right - handed quarks are different each other on @xmath5 , but their total numbers on @xmath90 are the same .      here",
    "we investigate the d - brane configurations leading to the symmetric flavor structure , that is , the intersecting numbers for left and right - handed quarks are the same on @xmath5 .",
    "suppose that the flavor number is equal to @xmath6 , e.g. on the first @xmath5 while their intersecting numbers on the other @xmath215 are equal to one .",
    "then , easily we can show the number of higgs fields , which can have allowed 3-point couplings with these quarks , is equal to @xmath7 , where @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "let us consider three sets of d - branes , @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 branes with the following winding numbers , @xmath221 in this subsection , we omit the index @xmath222 denoting the first @xmath5 , because we discuss the d - brane configurations only on the first @xmath5 .",

    "then , we consider the symmetric flavor structure , @xmath226 through a simple algebraic calculation , that implies that @xmath227 where @xmath104 is a real number . the sign in l.h.s",

    "recall here that @xmath232 is the shortest vector on @xmath12 along its direction .",
    "that implies that @xmath104 must be integer .",
    "thus , we obtain the number of higgs fields @xmath233 namely , the minimum number of higgs fields is equal to @xmath6 . , the minimum number of higgs is not equal to 2 , but 4 . see appendix b for such case . ] in this case , we find @xmath234 and the varieties of shift vectors , @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 are the same .",
    "thus , this type of d - brane configurations lead to only diagonal couplings for one of @xmath6 higgs fields .",
    "indeed , the selection rule is determined by the discrete abelian symmetry .    as an illustrating example , we consider the case of @xmath238 , e.g. with the following winding numbers , @xmath239 indeed , this configuration leads to @xmath240 .",
    "all of the sublattices , @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 , are the same , and spanned by ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,3 ) .",
    "the intersecting points of these d - branes are described by the shift vectors , @xmath244 where @xmath245 ( mod 3 ) .",

    "this form of yukawa coupling is generic form when the three sets of d - branes intersect at the same point , although we have shown the explicit winding numbers .",
    "when @xmath161 is sufficiently suppressed , its three eigenvalues are obtained by vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the higgs fields , @xmath250 , for @xmath251 , and its diagonalizing matrix is obtained as orbifold models . ]",
    "@xmath252    we apply the above yukawa matrix to the up and down sectors of quarks with higgs fields @xmath253 and suppression factors @xmath254 .",
    "the quark mass ratios are obtained as @xmath255 moreover , the mixing angles are predicted as @xmath256 by the two parameters @xmath254 .",
    "this prediction does not fit the experimental values .",
    "when the three sets of d - branes do not intersect at the same point , the yukawa matrix becomes @xmath257 where @xmath166 is a continuous parameter @xmath258 to denote the nearest distance among three types of intersecting points .",
    "this is generic form of yukawa matrix for the symmetric flavor structure with @xmath238 flavor and the three higgs fields .",
    "application of this form to the up and down sectors of quarks does not seem to lead to fully realistic results @xcite .",
    "similarly we can discuss the d - brane configurations with more than three higgs fields , i.e. the case with the @xmath259 higgs fields for @xmath260 .",
    "in this case , the sublattices @xmath241 and @xmath242 are still the same and these are spanned by @xmath232 and @xmath261 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sublattice @xmath243 is spanned by @xmath262 and @xmath261 , and is less dense than @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "that implies the number of coset representatives corresponding to @xmath263 is @xmath104 times as large as one of @xmath264 and @xmath265 , that is , the independent set of intersecting points for the higgs fields is described by the joint of sets of shift vectors @xmath266 for @xmath267 , while the independent set of intersecting points for left and right - handed quarks is described by the set of shift vectors @xmath268 .",
    "however , the part @xmath269 is irrelevant to the coupling selection rule , that is , the selection rule is determined by the same @xmath270 symmetry , and the part @xmath269 has the trivial charge under the @xmath270 symmetry . as a result ,",
    "the same couplings are allowed except replacing @xmath271 where @xmath272 denotes the higgs field corresponding to the shift vector @xmath133 and we have omitted coefficients . as a result ,",
    "only diagonal couplings are allowed for one of higgs fields .",
    "here we give an explicit model with @xmath6 flavors and @xmath273 higgs fields . in this case",
    "we have the following yukawa matrix , @xmath274 when all of three sets of d - brane intersect at the same point .    including many higgs fields",
    "may lead to realistic yukawa matrices for the quark and lepton sectors , when we assume proper vevs for these higgs fields .",
    "however , that raises another question : how can we realize such proper ratios of higgs vevs .",
    "here we study the asymmetric flavor structure on @xmath5 , that is , the numbers of left and right - handed quarks are different each other , e.g. on the first @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath275 . the total number of left and right - handed quarks must be the same .",
    "thus , intersecting points , e.g. on the second @xmath5 , must satisfy @xmath276 .",
    "first , let us investigate which types of d - brane configurations can appear .",
    "again , we consider three sets of d - branes , @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 branes with the following winding numbers on the first @xmath5 , @xmath277 suppose that @xmath278 where @xmath279 , and @xmath280 . through a simple algebraic calculation , we can show @xmath281 where @xmath282 is integer .",
    "then , we can calculate @xmath283 here the integer @xmath284 must satisfy @xmath285 for example , if @xmath286 , the above discussion could be applied to show that @xmath287 with integer @xmath288 .",
    "that is inconsistent with the above condition @xmath289 .",
    "thus , the generic d - brane configuration should satisfy @xmath290    we have understood the generic d - brane configuration .",
    "now , let us consider the selection rule for such generic case . in section 3",
    ", we have shown that all of couplings are allowed in the d - brane configuration satisfying eq.([co - prime ] ) . here",
    "we extend that into the generic case .",
    "we take @xmath291 as the greatest common divisor of any two intersecting numbers .",
    "suppose that @xmath292 then , the sublattices are spanned by @xmath293 where @xmath294 and @xmath295 , @xmath296 and @xmath297 are certain integeres , but irrelevant to our discussions . in this case",
    ", the combination of the sublattices , @xmath298 and @xmath243 corresponds to the sublattice , which is spanned by @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",
    "therefore , the coupling selection rule is determined by the discrete @xmath301 symmetry .",
    "let us write this generic result on the coupling selection rule in simple words .",
    "when we label intersecting points by @xmath302 , @xmath303 and @xmath304 , i.e. , @xmath305 the coupling selection rule is obtained as @xmath306 where @xmath307 for @xmath308 .",
    "this selection rule is mentioned also in @xcite as ansatz .    in generic case ,",
    "the sublattices are spanned by @xmath309 where @xmath310 and @xmath311 then , the combination of the sublattices , @xmath298 and @xmath243 corresponds to the sublattice , which is spanned by @xmath312 and @xmath313 .",
    "hence , the coupling selection rule is determined by the @xmath314 symmetry .",
    "this selection rule is also written as a simple extension of eq.([zc - symmetry ] ) .",
    "we have understood the generic d - brane configuration and its coupling selection rule . from phenomenological viewpoint ,",

    ".    the minimal case , which can lead to non - vanishing mixing with only one higgs field , may be the d - brane configuration with the intersecting numbers , @xmath319 the total flavor number @xmath6 is equal to @xmath320 , and left and right - handed quarks are denoted by @xmath321 and @xmath322 , respectively , where the indices @xmath323 label intersecting points on the first and second tori for @xmath251 and @xmath324 .",
    "the indices @xmath325 have the same meaning . in this case with one higgs field , the total yukawa matrix is obtained as a direct product of the parts from the first and second tori , i.e. , @xmath326 the generic form of @xmath327 and @xmath328 is obtained by eqs.([asym-1 ] ) , ( [ asym-2 ] ) with different suppression factors @xmath161 and @xmath329 .",
    "thus , this yukawa matrix @xmath330 has the non - trivial form with the rank - four , that is , the mass ratios among massive modes and diagonalizing matrix elements are determined by geometrical aspects .",
    "however , when we apply this form to up and down sectors of quarks , it can not realize experimental values of masses and mixing angles .",
    "the clear problem is that the flavor number is larger and two flavors remain still massless .",
    "also , another phenomenological aspect is that off - diagonal entries are suppressed compared with diagonal entries .",
    "however , experimental values of mass ratios and mixing angles in the quark sector as well as the lepton sector satisfy @xmath331 for @xmath332 , and that implies off - diagonal entries must not be suppressed so much in one of up and down sectors .    the generic aspects of the asymmetric flavor structure with the intersecting numbers @xmath333 , which satisfy @xmath334 and @xmath335 , is as follows .",

    "when all of three sets of @xmath169-brane do not intersect at the same point , the factor matrix @xmath327 is obtained in the same way except by replacing @xmath346 , where @xmath166 is a continuous parameter @xmath258 .    the total flavor number @xmath6 is obtained as @xmath347 .",
    "the rank of the full yukawa matrix is equal to @xmath348 when @xmath349 .",
    "thus , the @xmath350 modes appear massless .",
    "off - diagonal entries are suppressed compared with diagonal entries , and not enough to realize experimental values of mixing angles .",

    "we consider the model with the intersecting numbers , @xmath351 .",
    "even if the intersecting numbers for the higgs fields are @xmath352 or @xmath353 , the rank of mass matrix is still equal to one .",
    "for example , in the former case , the yukawa couplings for each of higgs fields @xmath354 @xmath355 are a factorizable form like @xmath356 , and the mass matrix @xmath357 is still a factorizable form , @xmath358 that is , the rank - one matrix .",
    "the minimal case increasing the rank of mass matrix is @xmath359 , that is , the totally four higgs fields .",
    "then , the mass matrix becomes rank - two .    to make all of three flavors massive",
    ", we have to introduce more higgs fields .",
    "however , recall the rule for d - brane configuration discussed in subsection 4.1 when @xmath360 or @xmath361 .",
    "if we have e.g. @xmath360 in addition to @xmath362 , such d - brane configuration requires at least @xmath363 , and the minimum case with @xmath363 corresponds to the symmetric flavor structure , which have been discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "we have studied the flavor structures , which can be derived from intersecting d - brane configurations , including the symmetric flavor structures and asymmetric ones . for the symmetric flavor structure with @xmath238 ,",
    "corresponding d - brane configurations require the number of higgs fields to be equal to @xmath259 with integer @xmath104 .",
    "for the asymmetric flavor case , the d - brane configurations with @xmath364 lead to the factorizable form of yukawa matrix , @xmath365 , that is , the rank - one matrix .",
    "that implies that even if we can realize the massless spectrum of the minimal supersymmetric standard model , we would have difficulty to derive realistic yukawa matrices from stringy 3-point couplings at the tree - level .",
    "for the symmetric flavor case as well as the asymmetric case , introduction of many higgs fields may lead to realistic yukawa matrices .",
    "however , in such case , proper values of ratios among vevs of many higgs fields have to be chosen .",
    "also , introduction of many higgs fields may lead to a problem , because that , in general , causes flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "one solution is that we introduce extra fields @xmath366 , which have mass terms with higgs fields larger than the weak scale , and that only one mode remains light .",
    "if such light mode is a linear combination of original modes with proper coefficients , then realistic yukawa matrices can be realized .    for the asymmetric flavor case ,",
    "off - diagonal couplings are allowed for one higgs field , e.g. @xmath367 , and the cases with more intersecting points also lead to non - trivial mixing angles . however , in such case the flavor number is larger than three .",
    "we have to reduce the flavor number , that is , we have to introduce anti - generations and mass terms between generations and anti - generations .",
    "thus , it is quite important to generate mass terms among higgs fields @xmath3 and extra fields @xmath366 , and/or generations and anti - generations of quarks .",
    "one of stringy ways to generate mass terms is recombination of d - branes .",
    "however , if those d - branes are stabilized to be bending , it is not clear how to treat them . otherwise , if those are stabilized not to bend , but be straightened , the resultant d - brane configurations would be classified into the d - brane configurations , which have been studied in subsections 4.1 and 4.2 .",
    "anyway , stringy way to generate mass terms is beyond our scope .",
    "thus , here we give comments on this issue from the viewpoint of effective field theory .",
    "within the framework of effective field theory , there may be two ways to generate mass terms ; one is through symmetry breaking and the other is due to compositeness through strong dynamics .",
    "concerned about the former scenario , suppose that we have the following type of couplings , @xmath368 these couplings are originated from the d - brane configuration of fig . 5 for the higg fields , and a similar configuration for the quarks .",
    "these coupling strengths @xmath369 are calculated within the framework of string theory .",
    "suppose that the fields @xmath370 develop their vevs .",
    "then , the above operators become effective mass terms between @xmath3 and @xmath366 , and @xmath371 and @xmath372 , and that can reduce the number of light flavors and light higgs fields .",
    "note that the vevs of the fields @xmath370 break gauge symmetries , under which @xmath370 have non - trivial representations .",
    "thus , the gauge group , which is obtained at the string scale , must be larger than one of the standard model .",
    "= 0.6    the latter scenario to generate mass terms is similar to the former .",
    "suppose again that we have the same type of couplings as eq.([extra ] ) .",
    "this time , we assume that the gauge coupling corresponding to the gauge group , under which both @xmath370 and @xmath366 , and @xmath370 and @xmath372 , have non - trivial charges becomes strong .",
    "such gauge sector corresponds to the @xmath373 brane in fig .",
    ", composite modes appear @xmath374 and @xmath375 . obviously , these composite modes have effective mass terms with @xmath3 and @xmath371 .",
    "then , the numbers of higgs fields and flavors can be reduced .    in the composite scenario ,",
    "the light modes can be composite modes , when the flavor number from composite modes is larger than one of original modes . in this case",
    ", effective yukawa couplings can be originated from stringy @xmath65-point couplings for @xmath376 depending on which modes correspond to composite modes . actually , such explicit models with composite modes have been studied showing an interesting form of yukawa matrices @xcite .",
    "it is quite important to study somehow systematically the flavor structure , which can be derived from intersecting d - brane configurations , considering the above scenarios to reduce the higgs and flavor numbers through the symmetry breaking and strong dynamics .",
    "we have to classify higher dimensional operators as well as 3-point couplings . for such purpose",
    ", the discussions in the previous subsections would be useful .",
    "however , we leave it for future study .",
    "we have studied the flavor structure and the coupling selection rule within the framework of intersecting d - brane models .",
    "we have formulated the coupling selection rule in terms of shift vectors , which are coset representatives corresponding to @xmath377 . with this formulation ,",
    "we can write the coupling selection rule for generic @xmath65-point couplings in a simple way .",
    "we have found that generic d - brane configurations must satisfy the relation ( [ generic - conf ] ) . in such generic case ,",
    "the coupling selection rule is determined by the discrete abelian symmetry .",
    "for example , the symmetric flavor structure with @xmath238 requires at least three higgs fields , and the coupling selection rule is determined by the @xmath25 symmetry .",
    "we may need more higgs fields to derive realistic yukawa matrices .    in the asymmetric flavor structure",
    ", the case with @xmath238 leads to the result that only the third family becomes massive , but the others remain massless . for the asymmetric flavor structure with more flavor , we have non - trivial yukawa matrices , although their diagonal entries are quite larger than off - diagonal entries and some modes remain still massless .",
    "our results show that even if we could obtain the minimal matter content of the supersymmetric standard model at the string scale , we would face with the difficultly to derive realistic yukawa matrices",
    ". it would be interesting to study alternative scenario that we may have several higgs fields and generations and anti - generations of fermions and investigate a way to generate mass terms e.g. within the effective field - theoretical way .",

    "it is important to study higher dimensional operators and loop - effects . in particular , it is interesting to classify d - brane configurations with allowed @xmath65-point couplings for @xmath378 from the viewpoint of the scenarios discussed in subsection 4.3 .    in heterotic orbifold models without wilson lines ,",
    "massless spectra are degenerate on all of fixed points , and a large number of quarks and leptons as well as higgs fields appear .",

    "the set of independent shifts are obtained as @xmath412 where @xmath413 .",
    "there are other equivalent descriptions of shift vectors .",
    "in subsection 4.1 , we have shown that if @xmath415 on @xmath5 , the intersecting number @xmath416 must satisfy @xmath417 with @xmath216 , that is , the minimum number of @xmath416 is equal to @xmath6 . here ,",
    "again we omit the index for the @xmath69-th torus like subsection 4.1 . however , this statement is not true for @xmath414 .",
    "indeed , the case with @xmath418 requires @xmath419 . if the following relation @xmath420 is true , we could write @xmath421 where the signs depend on signs of @xmath422 and @xmath423 . however , the relations ( [ int - no-2 ] ) and ( [ int - no-2 - 2 ] ) are inconsistent in the d - brane configurations .",
    "the relation ( [ int - no-2 - 2 ] ) always leads to @xmath424 ( even , even ) except the two cases with @xmath425 however , both of these cases lead to @xmath426 odd .",
    "thus , one can not realize the d - brane configuration with the relation ( [ int - no-2 ] ) .",
    "the flavor structure with @xmath427 on @xmath5 is not realistic , but that can be useful as a piece of a full flavor structure , when we combine it with other flavor structures on @xmath215 .",
