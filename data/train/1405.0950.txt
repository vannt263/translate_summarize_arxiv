    "the logarithmic law of the wall for the mean velocity in a rough - wall turbulent boundary layer , written below using an effective roughness scale , @xmath7 is a well - established result @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath8 is the streamwise velocity component , @xmath9 is the friction velocity , @xmath10 is the von krmn constant , @xmath11 is the height from the wall , and @xmath4 is the roughness length .",
    "models based on the ` attached - eddy hypothesis ' @xcite have predicted a logarithmic behavior for the variance of the fluctuations of the streamwise velocity component in the inertial layer .",
    "however , only recently clear experimental evidence @xcite has emerged for a universal law for the variance ( second - order moment profiles ) of the streamwise velocity fluctuations , based on well - resolved experimental boundary layer data at sufficiently high reynolds numbers .",
    "the log - law for the variance has the form @xmath12 where @xmath0=@xmath13 is the normalized streamwise velocity fluctuation and @xmath14 is an outer length scale .",
    "the experimental data are consistent with a value of @xmath15 , i.e. the ` townsend - perry ' constant @xcite , while @xmath16 depends on the flow conditions and geometry and is not thought to be universal .",
    "when gaussian behavior is assumed , the even - order moments can be related to the second - order moment through the relationship @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the double factorial @xcite .",
    "this relationship between the second and @xmath19-moments means that the @xmath20 root of the even order moments of the velocity fluctuations should follow a generalized logarithmic law for higher - order moments as follows @xmath21 the assumption of gaussian statistics furthermore implies that @xmath22^{1/p}$ ] . the results of @xcite show that the experimental data are consistent with the logarithmic trends of the @xmath23th root of the moments , but deviations from the gaussian prediction for the slopes @xmath2 are found .",
    "observation of such possibly canonical statistical behavior in boundary layers provides valuable points of reference for turbulence theories and various applications .",
    "knowledge about the probability density function of velocity fluctuations plays an important role in diverse practical applications , such as characterizing wind - turbine power fluctuations to estimating probabilities of extreme events .",
    "in addition , the generalized logarithmic laws for higher - order moments may serve as a new benchmark on which to test predictions from models and simulations .",
    "there is relatively little information available about the ability of les to reproduce accurately higher - order statistics of turbulence .",
    "most of the literature to date focuses on comparisons of mean velocity distributions and second - order moments .",
    "it is important to recall that most les models are motivated by the need to dissipate kinetic energy at the correct rate , i.e. to reproduce the correct second - order statistics such as mean kinetic energy .",
    "however , there is no guarantee that the inherent nonlinear dynamics of les will actually reproduce the extreme values of the distributions that arise from the real nonlinear dynamics in the real physical system .",
    "an earlier study @xcite provided comparisons of les and experiments for inertial - range velocity increments and their high - order moments in decaying isotropic turbulence . overall , the results were encouraging .",
    "however , in wall - bounded flows the situation is significantly more challenging due to flow inhomogeneity , anisotropy , wall - blocking , etc .",
    "prior studies on the accuracy of les for high - reynolds number wall - modeled turbulent boundary layers include those of @xcite , who explored various resolution criteria to reproduce accurately the mean velocity profiles , and @xcite who documented behavior of variances and third - order moments . in this paper",
    ", we use data from high - resolution les of a turbulent wall - bounded flow to study the ability of les to reproduce fundamental scaling laws for second as well as higher - order moments .",
    "such analysis has not yet been done and is needed to place les on firmer fundamental ground as a tool to model turbulence .    in section [ section2 ]",
    "we start with a brief description of the simulation method .",
    "subsequently , in section [ section3_1 ] we compare the streamwise velocity fluctuation variance from les with experimental data @xcite and in section [ section3_2 ] we discuss the role of the numerical resolution and possible effects of model and physical length scales characterizing the near - wall region and in setting the lower limit of the logarithmic region for the variance .",
    "then , in section @xmath24 the spanwise and vertical velocity fluctuations are analyzed in more detail , which is followed by conclusions in section [ section4 ] .",
    "the les code we use to study the turbulent wall - bounded flow solves the filtered incompressible navier - stokes equations without buoyancy , system rotation or other effects .",
    "the nonlinear terms are evaluated in rotational form . a pseudo - spectral discretization and",
    "thus double periodic boundary conditions are used in the horizontal directions parallel to the wall , while centered second - order finite differencing is used in the vertical direction @xcite .",
    "the deviatoric part of the sub - grid scale stress term is modeled using an eddy - viscosity sub - grid scale model , employing the scale - dependent lagrangian dynamic approach in conjunction with the smagorinsky model and a sharp spectral cutoff test - filter @xcite .",
    "only this model will be used here , since this study is not focused on comparing the performance of different sub - grid scale models ( such comparisons will be presented elsewhere ) .",
    "the trace of the sgs stress is combined into the modified pressure , as is common practice in les of incompressible flow .",
    "a second - order accurate adams - bashforth scheme is used for the time integration .",
    "due to the very large reynolds numbers considered here we parameterize the bottom surface by using a classic imposed wall stress boundary condition .",
    "this boundary condition relates the wall stress to the velocity at the first grid point using the standard logarithmic similarity law @xcite using velocities test - filtered at twice the grid scale @xcite .",
    "this test - filtering ensures that the average predicted stress is close to the stress predicted by the classic logarithmic law .",
    "in addition the viscous stresses are neglected .",
    "the wall stress is expressed in terms of the velocity at the first grid point above the wall ( at height @xmath25 for the staggered vertical mesh , @xmath26 is the vertical grid spacing ) according to @xmath27 } \\right]^2 \\left ( \\left[\\overline{u}(x , y,\\delta z/2 ) \\right]^2 + \\left[\\overline{v}(x , y,\\delta z/2 ) \\right]^2 \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 indicate the test - filtered , with a spectral cutoff , streamwise and spanwise velocity .",
    "subsequently , the stress is divided into its streamwise and spanwise component using the direction of @xmath30 . for the top boundary we use a zero - vertical - velocity and zero - shear - stress boundary condition so that the flow studied corresponds effectively to a ` half - channel flow ' with an impermeable centerline boundary .",
    "the flow is driven by an applied pressure gradient in the @xmath31-direction , which in equilibrium determines the wall stress @xmath32 and the velocity scale @xmath9 used to normalize the results of the simulations , together with the domain height @xmath33 used to normalize length scales .",
    "the les code has been further documented and applied in various previous publications @xcite .",
    ".large - eddy simulation cases . the simulation for @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "are performed on a @xmath36 domain in the streamwise , spanwise and vertical direction , respectively , and the @xmath37 cases on a @xmath38 domain .",
    "the table indicates the number of grid points used for the different cases and the ratio between the horizontal and vertical grid spacing .",
    "all simulations use the scale - dependent lagrangian sub - grid model . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    as periodic boundary conditions are used in the streamwise and spanwise directions , a sufficiently large domain in these directions is required in order to allow the flow to develop with negligible correlation over the domain length .",
    "therefore we use a domain up to @xmath38 in the streamwise , spanwise , and vertical directions , respectively .",
    "we perform simulations with different grid resolutions and roughness scale @xmath39 , see table [ table1 ] , to study their influence .",
    "note that for the @xmath37 case a larger domain size is used .",
    "for this case the mean velocities ( compared to the friction velocity ) are higher than for the higher roughnesses and , as will be explained in more detail below , we found that a larger computational domain is necessary for this case to prevent unphysical streamwise and spanwise correlations associated to the use of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "as discussed below in detail , a sufficient grid resolution is needed to accurately capture the logarithmic region for higher - order moments . in the beginning of the article we compare the simulation performed on the @xmath40 grid with @xmath35 ( case i2 ) with the smooth - wall experimental data collected at the university of melbourne ( hereafter the melbourne data ) at @xmath41 @xcite before we compare the les of the cases with different roughness lengths with several experimental data sets .    in order to limit the computational time that is needed to reach a statistically stationary state , an interpolated flow field obtained from a lower resolution simulation",
    "is used as initial condition for the next , higher resolution simulation .",
    "each case has been run for about @xmath42 dimensionless time units ( where the dimensionless time is in units of @xmath43 ) before it is used as initial condition . for the simulation cases on the @xmath44 grid",
    "this is followed by integrating for an additional @xmath45 dimensionless time unit on the fine grid before data collection is started .",
    "subsequently , data are collected over roughly @xmath46 time units while collecting a full snapshot of the flow field every @xmath47 time units . for the @xmath48 cases",
    "the flow is simulated for approximately @xmath45 time unit and snapshots are saved every @xmath49 time units .",
    "a visualization of streamwise velocity normalized by @xmath9 from a snapshot is shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the usual elongated structures can be seen at various distances to the wall and the increase of the variance towards the wall is also evident . in figure",
    "[ figure2]a we show that the time averaged mean velocity is close to the expected logarithmic law for the three different roughness lengths considered here , although a small `` bump '' in the log - law can be discerned at about @xmath50 to @xmath49 , depending on the grid resolution .",
    "many works have proposed various improvements in sub - grid and wall modeling approaches to further improve agreement with the logarithmic law for mean velocity . here",
    "we take a well - documented model which exhibits good ( but not optimized ) performance in predicting the mean velocity and focus on higher - order moments of the fluctuating ( resolved ) velocity . the horizontally averaged vertical stress profiles in figure",
    "[ figure2]b confirm that the flow has reached a statistically stationary state in the sense that the linear shear stress profile balances the driving pressure gradient .",
    "figure [ figure2]b shows that , due to the high resolution , the modeled normalized sub - grid scale stresses ( @xmath51 ) only become larger than @xmath52 of the total stresses ( @xmath53 ) for @xmath54 , for the case shown ( case i2 ) .",
    "this is also the location where the `` bump '' is seen in the mean velocity profile .",
    "we note that the results for the other roughness lengths are similar .",
    "further characterization of the les result for case i2 is provided from the streamwise spectra shown in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "the les captures some of the expected @xmath55 behavior for all velocity components , although the spectra become slightly steeper for the highest wave - numbers .",
    "a peel - off at various heights can be seen that prevents a complete collapse onto a single -5/3 slope due to the different values of the cutoff wavenumber when normalized with @xmath11 . in the production range @xmath56 , for the streamwise velocity component a slope of approximately @xmath57",
    "is observed in experiments @xcite and in les of atmospheric boundary layers by @xcite , see figure [ figure3]a .",
    "the slope is lower for the spanwise velocity component and approximately horizontal for the vertical velocity component .",
    "the pdfs of the velocity fluctuations in figure [ figure3 ] reveal that the streamwise velocity component is sub - gaussian , hence with a negative skewness , see figure [ figure4]a .",
    "the skewness for the three velocity components is plotted in figure [ figure4]a .",
    "the sign change of the skewness for the streamwise velocity component has also been observed in experimental data @xcite and a corresponding model has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "the spanwise and vertical velocity components are super - gaussian , with a positive skewness for the vertical velocity component and a near zero skewness for the spanwise velocity component . for the vertical velocity component we can compare the results observed in les of planetary boundary layers , see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite , which is a slightly different case because the effect of the temperature inversion is not included in our simulations .",
    "@xcite show that the change from negative to positive skewness shifts from @xmath58 on a @xmath59 grid , where @xmath60 is the inversion height , towards @xmath61 on a @xmath62 grid .",
    "the same trend is observed in our dataset .",
    "apart from this near wall behavior , the les results and measurements @xcite are found to be consistent although we note that there is significant scatter in the measurements .",
    "the observed flatness of the vertical velocity component between @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 and its increase at the top of the domain are also consistent with the les of @xcite and recent measurements @xcite .",
    "later on we will evaluate high - order moments of the fluctuating velocities and thus statistical convergence is an important issue . as done in the analysis of experimental data @xcite , one can test for convergence by examining premultiplied pdfs .",
    "figure [ figure5 ] shows the premultiplied pdfs for the even - order moments up to the @xmath66-order .",
    "the figure shows that the moments , i.e.  the area under the corresponding curves , can be determined accurately up to the @xmath66-order moment for the streamwise velocity component . for the spanwise and vertical velocity component",
    "we see that the statistics are slightly less converged for the @xmath66-order moment , but still this convergence can be considered as acceptable .",
    "in section [ section3_1 ] we compare the streamwise velocity data with experimental data from the melbourne wind tunnel @xcite , before discussing the effect of the numerical resolution and near - wall cross - over length scales ( from the near wall region to the logarithmic region for the variance ) in section [ section3_2 ] .",
    "subsequently we present les results for the spanwise and vertical velocity components in section [ section3_4 ] .",
    "figure [ figure6]a shows a comparison of the experimental ( empty circles ) and les profiles of variance of streamwise velocity fluctuations .",
    "the experiments at @xmath67 from @xcite are plotted as function of @xmath68 where @xmath14 is the boundary layer thickness , while the les results are plotted as function of @xmath69 . for the data",
    ", it appears that the equivalence between the two outer scales ( @xmath33 for the les and @xmath14 for the boundary layer ) appears appropriate , since no additional horizontal shifting is seen to be required .",
    "the agreement between the les and the data is quite good for @xmath70 , with a logarithmic layer for the variance visible from about @xmath71 down to about @xmath50 .",
    "this is further confirmed by examining the local slope plot in fig .",
    "[ figure6]b , which displays good agreement between les and experiment down to @xmath50 .",
    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the suggested range of the logarithmic region for the variance , and within this region the slope is @xmath15 shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figure6]a .",
    "note that the reported profiles for the variance from les corresponds to the ` resolved ' part of the fluctuations and do not include the sub - grid scale variance . in order to verify that the sub - grid scale variance can be neglected in the logarithmic region for the variance @xmath72",
    ", we examine the variance spectra , see figure [ figure3 ] , in more detail .",
    "the second - order moment is related to variance spectra as follows @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the 1-d variance spectrum of the streamwise velocity component in the streamwise wavenumber direction , at height @xmath11 .",
    "the integration is over the resolved wavenumber range , from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , where @xmath76 is the largest resolved wavenumber in the les . by extrapolating the spectra toward infinity the resolved variance in the streamwise velocity component can be compared to its assumed true value .",
    "we provide estimates for the total variance by extrapolating the spectrum towards @xmath77 ( for practical purposes we approximate infinity with @xmath78 ) and using @xmath79 where the second term ( the sgs variance , which we will also denote as @xmath80 ) is calculated from an extrapolated spectrum from the les data .",
    "we use three ways to specify @xmath81 used in the second term .",
    "the first method is a least squares fit to the les spectrum from @xmath82 until @xmath76 , the second method a least squares fit to the les spectrum from @xmath82 until @xmath83 and the third method using a @xmath84 spectrum starting at @xmath76 .",
    "the result of this procedure is shown in figure [ figure7 ] and shows that for @xmath85 more than @xmath86 of the variance in the flow is resolved by our les , and for most heights it is more than @xmath87 .",
    "we note that these observations are qualitatively consistent with the observation that the modeled normalized sub - grid scale stresses ( @xmath51 ) only become larger than @xmath52 of the total stresses ( @xmath88 ) for @xmath54 , see figure [ figure1]b . here",
    "we emphasize that different methods could be used to estimate the sub - grid scale variance , which could lead to slightly different results .",
    "therefore the mentioned fraction of the resolved variance and the corresponding sub - grid scale variance should be considered as an approximation only . as is shown in figure [ figure7 ]",
    "the uncertainty becomes larger closer to the wall due to the difficulties in estimating the sub - grid scale variance when the resolved variance in the flow is only in the order of @xmath89 which happens in the first few grid - points above the wall .",
    "here we also emphasize that the mean and variance profiles obtained from les are relatively resolution independent in the well resolved region of the flow , while differences are observed closer to the wall where the resolution influences the resolved variance in the flow most .",
    "next , in figure [ figure8]a we present profiles of moments of order @xmath3 , raised to the power @xmath90 .",
    "it shows that the higher - order , even moments of the streamwise velocity also agree quite well with the experimental data . in agreement with this observation",
    "the corresponding @xmath2 values ( see ) obtained from fitting the data in the interval @xmath72 also show good agreement , see figure [ figure8]b .",
    "estimates for the near - wall start of the logarithmic region for the variance vary significantly .",
    "the classical theoretical assumption is that the equilibrium logarithmic layer begins at a fixed value of @xmath91 .",
    "however , recent experimental evidence @xcite and studies such as those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest that there is a reynolds - number dependence for the lower limit of this region . specifically , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have proposed a @xmath92 dependence for the lower limit of the logarithmic law for the variance . at very high reynolds numbers ,",
    "such a trend raises the interesting question about how to represent effects of viscosity in ` infinite reynolds number ' les in which the viscous stress is neglected entirely .",
    "also , the status of such a scaling for rough - wall boundary layers has not been established .",
    "here we examine this issue from the viewpoint of our les results . in general agreement with observations from experimental data",
    "@xcite we find that the turbulence intensity profiles tend to depart more abruptly from the logarithmic profile for the variance than profiles of the mean velocity when approaching the wall .",
    "figure [ figure6 ] shows the les data begin to deviate from the logarithmic law for the variance when @xmath93 .",
    "we point out that also at this height the mean velocity displays a non - negligible `` bump '' as seen in figure [ figure2 ] around the twelfth vertical grid point , i.e.  @xmath94 .    in the les , since viscous effects are neglected , there are only a few other characteristic length scales in the near - wall region : the grid resolution @xmath5 ( here we use the simplifying characterization of grid scale as @xmath95 , see @xcite for a justification ) , the les mixing length @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the dynamically determined smagorinsky coefficient , and the imposed roughness scale @xmath4 .",
    "we will denote the height of the break in the variance profiles as @xmath98 .",
    "one can postulate a simple extension of the two prior models for the lower limit of the logarithmic layer for the variance ( fixed @xmath99 , or additional dependence on reynolds number as @xmath100 ) to the case of les in which an ` les inner length - scale ' replaces the viscous scale , @xmath101 .",
    "then one is led to four possibilities : that the cross - over scales with grid resolution and then it could occur at either a fixed height @xmath102 , or at a fixed @xmath103 ( or with the corresponding mixing length @xmath6 instead of @xmath5 ) . or that the cross - over scales with roughness length @xmath4 , again leading to two possibilities : a cross - over at a fixed height @xmath104 or at a fixed @xmath105 .",
    "naturally , some other powers may be possible , or if @xmath106 is close to @xmath39 some intermediate options are possible , including dependencies on both @xmath106 and @xmath39 .",
    "we first examine the dependence of the cross - over on grid resolution @xmath5 . as discussed before ,",
    "the spectra ( figure [ figure3 ] ) and the vertical stress profiles ( figure [ figure2]b ) indicate that a smaller fraction of the variance of the flow is explicitly resolved in this region and the les modeling therefore becomes more important .",
    "the reason for this is that here the horizontal resolution becomes more limiting and at the same time the effect of the modeled wall stresses ( see ) becomes noticeable in this region .",
    "the results indicate that the position at which the les data for the higher - order moments begin to depart from the logarithmic law depends on the grid resolution . as there is uncertainty in the determination of @xmath98 , especially for lower resolution simulations",
    ", we find this location using two methods . in the first method",
    "we define @xmath107 based on the vertical location where @xmath108 , see figure [ figure2]b . in the second method @xmath107 is based on the position where da@xmath109/dz=0 .",
    "figure [ figure9 ] shows @xmath107 as function of @xmath106 assuming @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath110 criterion is used to prevent that the first local maximum in the @xmath111 as function of @xmath69 profiles , see figure [ figure6]b , is identified as the start of the logarithmic region for the variance . for the first method",
    "the uncertainty is based on the difference between @xmath98 obtained using @xmath112 and @xmath113 . for the second method the uncertainty gives the difference in @xmath107 obtained using @xmath111 and @xmath111 smoothed over a @xmath114 interval .",
    "the figure shows that the lower boundary at which the logarithmic region for the variance can be observed shifts towards the wall when the grid spacing is decreased . because the outer boundary of the logarithmic region for the variance occurs at a fixed fraction of the boundary layer thickness ( about @xmath115 to @xmath116 )",
    ", this means that a sufficient resolution is required to capture the logarithmic region for the variance over a significant interval . for our highest resolution",
    "simulation the start of the logarithmic region for the variance is identified to be around @xmath94 and for some of the lower resolution simulation the logarithmic region for the variance that can be resolved is too small to observe it clearly . although the data in figure [ figure9 ] show that a small power difference with @xmath117 dependence can not be excluded , certainly a scaling with @xmath118 does not appear to hold .",
    "figure [ figure10 ] shows that for all simulations , except for the two lowest resolution simulation ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( see table [ table1 ] ) ; case @xmath119 is omitted from these graphs as @xmath98 can not be determined well for that simulation ) the sub - grid scale variance is less than @xmath52 at @xmath98 and this decreases strongly with increasing resolution .",
    "figure [ figure10]b reveals , in agreement with figure [ figure9]a , that the results reasonably collapse when represented as function of @xmath102 . figure [ figure11 ] shows @xmath107 as function of @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) as function of @xmath121 .",
    "as the @xmath97 value at @xmath107 is relatively constant , the message of the corresponding figure is similar to the one shown in figure [ figure9 ] , and considering the uncertainty in the data it is hard to say whether @xmath96 or @xmath5 length scale is most appropriate .",
    "next , we examine the possible dependence of the cross - over height @xmath107 on the imposed roughness scale @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ figure12 ] shows the second - order moments of fluctuating streamwise velocity for the simulations and several experiments with the different @xmath123 and @xmath124 , and the corresponding local @xmath111 . here",
    "@xmath125 and @xmath126 are chosen such that all the shown data sets overlap in order to focus on @xmath111 and not on @xmath16 , which is discussed below . from figure [ figure13 ]",
    "we conclude that @xmath107 is roughly independent of @xmath39 .",
    "simulations using larger roughness lengths ( i.e. @xmath127 , not shown ) and at high resolution suggest that when @xmath39 is no longer much smaller than @xmath106 , the assumptions on which the equilibrium wall boundary condition is based , begin to lose validity and results ( not shown ) are degraded . in figure",
    "[ figure12]a one can also notice that the fluctuations close to the wall decrease with increasing roughness .",
    "the reason is that the rougher surface will result in a larger damping of the streamwise velocity fluctuations close to the wall . in figure",
    "[ figure12]b we see that this results in a slight decrease of @xmath111 as function of the roughness length .",
    "we note that the differences in the local @xmath111 obtained for the different roughness lengths in the les are mainly due to the difference in the resolutions used for these cases .",
    "figure [ figure14]a shows @xmath111 obtained from the region @xmath72 compared to the experimental data from several high @xmath128 number experiments as summarized in table 1 of @xcite . in order to relate the inner scale between our les and the experimental data on smooth wall boundary layers we use the approximate relationship @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath9 and @xmath14 are the air viscosity , friction velocity and boundary layer height in the experiment .",
    "the empirical values @xmath131 and @xmath132 and the @xmath130 , @xmath9 and @xmath14 values as documented in table 1 of @xcite are used .    as the @xmath16 value in the logarithmic law for the variance depends on the large - scale flow geometry ( e.g. it is expected to differ for channels and boundary layers ) , and because we are mainly interested in capturing the  universal \" slope @xmath133 behavior",
    ", we show the data in figure [ figure12]a as function of @xmath134 . for the experiments the uncertainties shown as error bars are the ones given in table @xmath45 and @xmath135 of @xcite .",
    "for the les we determine the uncertainty in the same way as done for the experimental data ( @xcite ) by determining the @xmath136 confidence bounds from the curve - fitting procedure . in order to obtain values",
    "consistent with the experimental ones we interpolate the les data to the measurements heights used in the experiments .",
    "the figure suggests that @xmath111 slowly decreases with increasing roughness although the trend is weak compared to the uncertainties .",
    "we also recall the observation of @xcite that @xmath2 for the higher - order moments becomes less sensitive to @xmath137 for increasing reynolds number .",
    "additional experimental and simulation results are needed to verify whether an actual @xmath4 dependence exists .",
    "in contrast to the fairly constant @xmath111 value it has been shown by @xcite that @xmath16 can vary significantly among different flows , indicative of dependencies on non - universal large - scale structures in turbulent wall - bounded flows . the data in figure [ figure14 ] show the observed variation of @xmath16 as function of @xmath39 .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath16 obtained from les is within the scatter obtained from the experiments . since the half - channel flow geometry in our les differs from the developing boundary layer experiments , to the degree that there are differences , these are to be expected .",
    "one can notice that the the @xmath16 value obtained from les is higher for @xmath37 than for the other two les cases .",
    "we are not sure what the reason is for this difference .",
    "the @xmath37 case is the more challenging case since its lower roughness leads to higher mean velocities ( compared to the friction velocity ) . as the increase in the velocity fluctuations is small compared to the increase in the mean velocity ,",
    "the turbulence intensity is significantly lower for this case than for the other cases .",
    "therefore a larger computational domain to prevent unphysical streamwise and spanwise correlations associated to the use of periodic boundary conditions is necessary .",
    "a too small domain leads to higher fluctuations .",
    "in addition , the @xmath138 and @xmath139 are largest for @xmath37 , which could influence the results . however ,",
    "unfortunately it is at the moment not possible to perform the @xmath37 with the same @xmath138 and @xmath139 as the other cases since this would require grids with more than an order of magnitude more grid points .",
    "we now turn to the fluctuations of the spanwise velocity component .",
    "figure [ figure15]a shows the higher - order moment data obtained from les for the spanwise fluctuations .",
    "the data in this figure do not reveal as clear a logarithmic region for the variance as the streamwise component results . as indicated before , the spanwise velocity fluctuations are more difficult to resolve than the streamwise velocity fluctuations since their characteristic length scales tend to be smaller than the elongated ones in the streamwise direction .",
    "this probably means that the results for the spanwise velocity component are more sensitive to the numerical resolution than for the streamwise velocity component . as we have seen in the previous section that the logarithmic region for the variance of the streamwise velocity can only be captured clearly when the grid is sufficiently fine",
    ", we can not exclude that les at significantly higher spanwise resolution could reveal a logarithmic region for the spanwise velocity fluctuations as well , but we believe this observation can not be made based on the current dataset .",
    "in contrast to the streamwise and spanwise velocity fluctuations , the higher - order moments for the vertical velocity fluctuations shown in figure [ figure15]b do not reveal any logarithmic region for the variance .",
    "because the vertical velocity fluctuations seem to decrease linearly starting from the outer boundary of the logarithmic region up to approximately the top of the domain , these data are presented in a linear scale . in this region the higher - order moments of the vertical velocity seem to be fitted well by @xmath140 we find that @xmath141 for @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , this means that @xmath143 increases almost linearly as function of @xmath23 ( gaussian prediction ) .",
    "we have used large - eddy simulations ( les ) to study the scaling of higher - order moments in high reynolds number turbulent wall - bounded flow . in the les used here , the sub - grid scale stresses are modeled using a dynamic eddy viscosity sub - grid scale model , while the stress at the wall is modeled using a log - law based closure for rough surfaces .",
    "the focus of the study is not on comparing the performance of different sub - grid closures or to explore resolution requirements in detail . instead , the focus is on exploring the capabilities of a more or less standard les tool in predicting the generalized logarithmic laws that have been recently observed from data at very high reynolds numbers .",
    "we also focus on the lower - limit ( distance to the wall ) of the generalized logarithmic law for moments observed near the wall in les , on exploring whether trends observed in experimental data as function of reynolds number ( viscous scales ) can be discerned when the latter are replaced by possible scalings with grid scale @xmath106 , sgs mixing length scale @xmath6 , or roughness scale @xmath39 .    in terms of reproducing a logarithmic law for variances and higher - order moments of the streamwise velocity fluctuations",
    ", we find very good agreement between the les and the experimental data , as long as a sufficiently fine resolution is used . in experiments",
    "the second and higher - order moments begin to deviate from the logarithmic law close to the wall due to viscous effects .",
    "non - trivial dependencies on reynolds numbers ( i.e. viscous effects ) were observed at significant distances from the wall ( hundreds of wall units ) . in the les ,",
    "in which the viscous effects are not included explicitly , the higher - order moments also are found to deviate from the logarithmic law at some distance @xmath107 from the wall .",
    "detailed tests show that for the les this effect is coupled to the grid scale or ( almost equivalently ) to the sgs mixing length used in the simulation and that @xmath107 is ( approximately ) independent of @xmath39 .",
    "while the simulations and comparisons with experimental data show that there might be a small dependence of @xmath111 on @xmath39 , the observed trend is very weak compared to the uncertainties in the data and possible limitations of the simulations .",
    "as all velocity components are available in the simulations , we also studied the spanwise and vertical velocity fluctuations . for the vertical velocity fluctuations we do not find any logarithmic regions .",
    "instead , outside the logarithmic region of the streamwise velocity , the variance of vertical velocity fluctuations as well as appropriate roots of higher - order moments decrease approximately linearly with the distance from the wall . for the spanwise",
    "velocity fluctuations , the variance and the appropriate roots of higher - order moments do not show a very clear logarithmic region in the current dataset .",
    "however , we can not exclude that significantly better resolved les could reveal such a logarithmic region as the data for the spanwise velocity component are found to be more sensitive to numerical grid resolution than for the streamwise velocity component .",
    "the present analysis illustrates how the recently established logarithmic behavior of high - order moments in wall - bounded turbulence may be used to examine and test the accuracy of les models with more rigor than only testing based on mean velocity profiles",
    ". it will be interesting to see how different sub - grid models , e.g.   the standard smagorinsky model , other eddy - viscosity models such as the @xcite or the wale model @xcite , or the modulated gradient model @xcite , may perform in reproducing higher - order moments .",
    "we note that some models such as the modulated gradient model or the @xmath144-equation model can provide additional information about sgs variance .",
    "in addition , these tests can be used to asses how different types of wall model boundary conditions affect the results , see for example the trends shown in @xcite and the new insights about importance and coupling of stress fluctuations with outer - scale motions @xcite .",
