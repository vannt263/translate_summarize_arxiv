    "the first solution of einstein s field equations was published by karl schwarzschild in 1916 .",
    "it is a solution that informs us about the spacetime generated in the exterior of a spherically symmetric and non - rotating distribution of mass .",
    "as is well known , that distribution of mass provides the region that surrounds it with a static , spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "that kind of spacetime is mathematically denoted by the line element ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath0 in spherical polar coordinates @xmath1 . in the second step above we introduced the functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 in place of the two unknowns @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively . that replacement was possible since @xmath6 and @xmath7 anywhere in spacetime",
    "of course , we have to impose a couple of boundary conditions to the aforementioned line element , i.e. @xmath8 for we demand , as is physically reasonable , that spacetime be flat far away from the distribution of mass .",
    "the previous results give us the ability to calculate the components @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) of einstein s tensor .",
    "the missing step , now , in order to calculate the unknown functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , is to find out the components @xmath13 of the stress - energy tensor , plug them into einstein s field equations , @xmath14 ( note that here and hereafter we use geometrized units unless otherwise mentioned ) and solve the resulting differential equations for @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the aforementioned tedious calculations lead us to the expressions @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total mass of the distribution of mass .",
    "therefore , we are finally in position to write down the line element in its final form : @xmath17",
    "in order to calculate the precession of the pericenter of the elliptic orbit of a massive body revolving an attractive center , we begin from the equation of motion @xmath18 where we suppose that the elliptic orbit is described by the radial distance , @xmath19 , and the azimuthal angle , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the proper time , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the energy and momentum per unit mass respectively and @xmath16 is the total mass of the attractive center .",
    "the shape of the effective potential @xmath24 for a typical value of the parameter @xmath25 is shown in fig .",
    "1 .    [ ] [ ] @xmath26 [ ] [ ] @xmath27 [ ] [ ] @xmath28 [ ] [ ] @xmath29 [ ] [ ] @xmath30 [ ] [ ] @xmath31 [ ] [ ] @xmath19     our study will be limited to energies @xmath32 , for we want the body to be in a stable orbit around the attractive center . as an example we can see the points @xmath30 and @xmath31 in fig . 1 , among which the body can move in a nearly elliptic orbit .    in order to write equation in the more convenient form",
    "@xmath33 we use the fact that @xmath34 therefore , we get @xmath35 we now proceed with the transformation @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a constant with length dimensions . that transformation gives us a differential equation with no dimensions : @xmath38 it is clear that we can separate the variables in the last differential equation , thus taking @xmath39    let , now , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 be the roots of the polynomial @xmath43 then , @xmath44 can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 . because of the equality of the coefficients of the same - order terms for the two forms of @xmath44 we get the equations @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49    we suppose that within the range of values of energy for which we study our problem , @xmath44 has the three real roots , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 for which . therefore , for @xmath50 we can state that the relation @xmath51 holds .",
    "that statement enables us to taylor - expand the term @xmath52 , @xmath53 and get @xmath54 @xmath55 we integrate the last relation for @xmath56 from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , so @xmath20 varies from zero to @xmath57 .",
    "the calculations yield @xmath58 @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "let , now , @xmath62 . from equation",
    "we get @xmath63 and so @xmath64 therefore , equation becomes @xmath65 where we neglect terms of order higher than @xmath66 .",
    "apparently , the resulting precession is @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 where we taylor - expanded the term @xmath73 keeping , one more time , terms of order not higher than @xmath74 .    in order to calculate @xmath75 we will use equations and , from which we get @xmath76 again , if we use the taylor expansion of the term @xmath77 which appears in the last equation , we take @xmath78\\epsilon ^2   - \\left ( { \\frac{{r_0 } } { { 2 m } } + \\frac{{1 -\\tilde{e}^2 } } { { \\tilde{l}^2 } } 2mr_0 } \\right)\\epsilon + \\frac{{r_0 ^ 2 } } { { \\tilde{l}^2 } } \\tilde{e}^2   = 0\\ ] ] the straightforward solution of the last equation gives us the values @xmath79 } } \\pm { } \\nonumber \\\\ & & { } \\frac{{\\frac{{r_0 } } { { 2m}}\\sqrt { 1 - \\frac{{16m^2 } } { { \\tilde{l}^2 } } + \\frac{{24m^2 } } { { \\tilde{l}^2 } } ( 1 - \\tilde{e}^2 ) + \\frac{{48m^4 } } { { \\tilde{l}^4 } } ( \\tilde{e}^2+\\frac{1}{3})(1 - \\tilde{e}^2 ) } } } { { 2\\left [ { 1 - \\frac{{4m^2 ( 1 - \\tilde{e}^2 ) } } { { \\tilde{l}^2 } } } \\right]}}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the two possible values of @xmath75 ( positive and negative sign ) we choose the one with the negative sign .",
    "that choice is based on the fact that we need @xmath75 to be a small compared to @xmath80 ( cf . equation and the discussion that follows it ) .",
    "the negative sign validates the requirement @xmath81 , something that is not accomplished via the use of the positive sign .",
    "therefore , that choice and the fact that for @xmath32 it is @xmath82 , enable us to write that @xmath83}}\\ ] ] if we taylor - expand the square root above and keep terms of order not higher than @xmath84 , we get @xmath85 } } { { { 1 - \\frac{{4m^2 ( 1 - \\tilde{e}^2 ) } } { { \\tilde{l}^2 } } } } } \\ ] ] where we neglect the term @xmath86 which appears during the calculations since @xmath32 .",

    "moreover , we can express the precession found ( equation ) as a function of the eccentricity , @xmath90 , and the semi - major axis , @xmath40 , of the elliptic orbit of the body .",
    "if we assume that the mass of the attractive center is much larger than the mass of the orbiting body , then @xmath91 therefore the precession in terms of @xmath90 and @xmath40 is given by the formula @xmath92\\ ] ] where we neglect terms of order higher than @xmath93 .",
    "equation can be used to calculate the precession of the perihelion of planet mercury s elliptic orbit around the sun .",
    "the semi - major axis of mercury s orbit is @xmath94 , its eccentricity is @xmath95 , while the mass of the sun is @xmath96 . of course",
    ", in order to find some real numerical values we should write down equation in si units .",
    "equation as we see it is valid as long as we remember that we use geometrized units , where the speed of light , @xmath42 , and the constant of gravitational attraction , @xmath97 , are taken to be equal to one : @xmath98 .",
    "the form of equation in the si system of units is @xmath99\\ ] ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "so if we take into account the fact that mercury spins around the sun 415 times within a century , then we get the precession @xmath102 note that in common bibliography the term @xmath103whose numerical value is 1.000004813 in the case of mercury  is just equal to unity",
    ". that exlains the fact that the precession we meet in the bibliography is @xmath104 .",
    "it is clear that the precession derived by this new approach for the case of planet mercury does not differ much from the precession derived with the usual way @xcite .",
    "however , if we happen to study the precession of pericenter for an orbit near a strong gravitational field ( e.g. in the vicinity of a black hole ) , then the extra term is expected to produce additional precession that will definitely be significant .",
    "i would like to thank my supervisor at the natl & capodistrian university of athens , dr .",
    "t. apostolatos , for his guidance and support .",
    "the above result would have not been found without his help ."
