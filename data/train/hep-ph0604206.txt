    "it was proposed that the strange matter could be the true ground state of the matter of the strong interaction .",
    "a finite volume droplet of the strange matter , which is called strangelet , has been also investigated . in the analysis of the mit bag model",
    ", it was shown that the strangelets were stable particles of large baryon number and small electric charge as compared with normal nuclei @xcite .",
    "several scenarios of formation of the strangelets have been considered in various contexts .",
    "the strangelets may be formed in the relativistic heavy ion collisions in the accelerator which can produce the quark - gluon plasma @xcite . in the cosmic scale , the strangelets may be formed in the qcd phase transition in the early universe and/or in the collisions of the compact stars containing a rich amount of strange quarks @xcite . as a remnant of such processes in the universe",
    ", the strangelets may be observed as exotic particles in the cosmic rays .",
    "indeed , there are several reports on the observation of the exotic particles in the cosmic rays @xcite .",

    "showed that the strange matter was not the stable state of the quark matter at low density , while it could become the ground state at high density , more than a few times of the normal nuclear matter density @xcite . at high density",
    ", the chiral symmetry of the @xmath2 quark is restored , and the @xmath2 quark mass becomes smaller than the fermi energy of the @xmath1 quarks .",
    "therefore , the weak decay process is allowed for the generation of @xmath2 quarks in the quark matter . however",
    ", this model analysis was not applied to the strangelets of finite volume , since the surface effects were not taken into account .    for the discussion of the stability of the strangelets with dynamical quarks ,",
