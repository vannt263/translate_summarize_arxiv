    "peaks over threshold modelling of univariate time series has been common practice since the seminal paper of @xcite , who advocated the use of the asymptotically motivated generalized pareto ( gp ) distribution @xcite as a model for exceedances over high thresholds .",
    "the multivariate generalized pareto distribution was introduced in @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) , and @xcite , but still , statistical modelling using this approach has thus far received relatively little attention .",
    "partially this is because theoretically equivalent dependence modelling approaches , based on the so - called `` point process approach '' , have already been in existence for some time @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the multivariate gp distribution has conceptual advantages over that of the point process representation , in so much as it represents a proper multivariate distribution on an `` l - shaped '' region , where at least one variable is extreme , @xmath0 ; see figure  [ fig : supp ] .",
    "furthermore , the gp distribution permits modelling of data on this region without the need to perform any marginal transformation , which is common in other extremal dependence modelling approaches .",
    "the justification for the use of multivariate gp distributions as models for the tails of essentially arbitrary distributions is the limit property in .",
    "there is a growing body of probabilistic literature devoted to multivariate gp distributions ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . to our knowledge , however , there are only a few papers that exploit these as a statistical model @xcite .    this paper forms a companion to @xcite , which collates new and existing probabilistic results on multivariate gp distributions .",
    "we briefly recall necessary elements from this paper , but our main focus is on statistical modelling and inference .",
    "the premise of statistical modelling using limiting distributions such as the gp distribution is that _ we assume the limit model holds sufficiently well in a sufficiently extreme region_. care is needed , however , to ensure that the postulated model is indeed appropriate .",
    "an important consideration when modelling multivariate extremes is the concept of asymptotic dependence .",
    "random variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 with distribution functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , are said to be asymptotically dependent if @xmath5 =   \\frac{{\\mathbb{p}}[f_1(y_1 ) >",
    "q , f_2(y_2 ) > q]}{1-q } \\to \\chi_{1:2 } > 0 , \\qquad q\\to1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] existence of the limit is an assumption , and the limit being positive characterizes asymptotic dependence , whereas @xmath6 defines asymptotic independence .",

    "multivariate gp distributions are useful mostly when @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath12 then the corresponding _ limiting _ gp distribution does not place any mass in @xmath11-dimensional space , with all the mass lying in some lower dimensional subspace instead . this situation is challenging to deal with , as in practice the data do belong to the full @xmath11-dimensional space .",
    "whilst modelling of such possibilities is not precluded in the censored likelihood framework that we adopt , we do not consider it further here .    yet",
    "other subtleties arise , since even when @xmath10 , this does not rule out the possibility of a distribution placing mass on some lower - dimensional subspace .",
    "however , for the remainder of the paper , we consider the simplified situation where there is no mass on any lower - dimensional subspace .      the contributions of this paper are the following . in section",
    "[ sec : background ] we present some of the key results and properties of multivariate gp distributions that are useful for statistical modelling . in section  [ sec : models ] we introduce a construction device for gp - distributed random vectors and use it to develop a variety of new and existing models in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "inference using a censored likelihood - based approach is detailed in section  [ sec : inference ] , together with threshold selection and goodness - of - fit diagnostics . in section  [ sec : applications ] we fit gp models to returns of four uk - based banks and to rainfall data in the context of landslide risk estimation , showing that multivariate gp modelling can be more useful for financial risk handling than one - dimensional methods , and that our models can respect physical constraints in a way which was not possible before .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "a common and broadly - applicable assumption on @xmath13 is that it is in the so - called _ max - domain of attraction _ of a multivariate max - stable distribution , @xmath16 .",

    "a.   standardize the data to common exponential margins , @xmath259 , using the rank transformation ( i.e. , the probability integral transform using the empirical distribution function ) ; b.   select a multivariate threshold , denoted @xmath260 on the scale of the observations , and @xmath261 on the exponential scale , using the method of section  [ sec : diagnostics ] ; c.   fit the most complicated standard form model within each class ( i.e. , maximum number of possible parameters ) to the standardized data @xmath262 ; d.   select as the standard form model class the one which produces the best fit to the standardized data , in the sense of smallest aic ; e.   use likelihood ratio tests to test for simplification of models within the selected standard form class , and select a final standard form model ; [ test ] f.   fit the gp margins simultaneously with this standard form model , to @xmath263 by maximizing  ; g.   test for simplifications in the marginal parameterization .    although this strategy is not guaranteed to result in a final gp model that is globally optimal , in the sense of minimizing an information criterion such as aic , it should still result in a sensible model whilst avoiding enumeration and fitting of an unfeasibly large number of possibilities . the validity of the fit of the selected model can be assessed via diagnostics .",
    "an important issue that pervades extreme value statistics  in all dimensions  is the selection of a threshold above which the limit model provides an adequate approximation of the distribution of threshold exceedances . here",
    "this amounts to `` how can we select a vector @xmath260 such that @xmath264 is well - approximated by a gp distribution ? '' .",
    "there are two considerations to take into account : @xmath265 should be well - approximated by a univariate gp distribution , for @xmath266 , and the dependence structure of @xmath264 should be well - approximated by that of a multivariate gp distribution .",
    "marginal threshold selection has a large body of literature devoted to it ; see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "threshold selection for dependence models is a much less well studied problem , though recent literature that begins to address this topic includes @xcite who consider threshold selection via bayesian measures of surprise , and @xcite who examines how to make better use of so - called parameter stability plots , offering a method that can be employed on any parameter , pertaining to the margins or dependence structure .",
    "here we propose using the `` constant conditional exceedance '' property of multivariate gp distributions outlined in section  [ sec : chi ] to guide threshold selection for the dependence structure .",
    "if @xmath267 and @xmath268 , then on the region @xmath269 , we have @xmath270 with @xmath271 .",
    "a consequence of this is that @xmath272 should be constant on the region @xmath273 , if @xmath260 represents a sufficiently high dependence threshold . hence if we identify @xmath274 , then @xmath275 should provide an adequate threshold for the dependence structure .",

    "figure  [ fig : datachi ] displays @xmath279 for data in the _ domain of attraction _ of a gp distribution .",

    "one diagnostic comes from comparing @xmath279 for @xmath285 to @xmath94 , which for models @xmath112 in has the form @xmath286,\\ ] ] whilst for models @xmath120 in we get the form @xmath287.\\ ] ] the formula of @xmath94 stemming from @xmath144 models then follows through equation  . in some cases these expressions",
