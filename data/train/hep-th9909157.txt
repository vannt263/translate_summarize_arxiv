    "the study of nonperturbative duality symmetries in the last years has dramatically changed our understanding of string theory .",
    "u - duality , introduced in @xcite , is one of these symmetries .",
    "it was conjectured to be generated by the target - space duality of @xmath2 ( see @xcite for a review ) and the modular group of the torus including the eleventh m - theory direction @xcite .",
    "this definition was adopted in the algebraic approach to u - duality reviewed in @xcite .",
    "using instead the original conjecture of @xcite that takes the hidden symmetries of low energy supergravity as a starting point , generators of discrete u - duality in four dimensions may be determined directly .",
    "groups in higher dimensions can be found by embeddings , and a method to determine the @xmath1 u - duality is presented . applied to a toy model corresponding to a truncation of m - theory , the method is seen to give a significantly different result than for the full theory .",
    "compactifying eleven dimensional supergravity , the low energy limit of m - theory , on @xmath3 yields 70 scalars arising from the @xmath4 3-form potential and the moduli of the torus .",
    "they may be joint in a field @xmath5 @xcite , a representation matrix in the fundamental * 56 * representation .",
    "furthermore , 28 @xmath6 gauge fields arise from the @xmath4 potential and metric . these fields and their magnetic duals",
    "can be arranged to 28 dimensional vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the equations of motion of the theory are invariant under classical @xmath10 duality and local @xmath11 transformations , acting as _",
    "f_|| ,  ^(4)h^(4 ) ,  e_7(+7 ) ,  h su(8 ) where @xmath12 . defining charges @xmath13 ,",
    "the dsz quantization condition breaks @xmath10 to a discrete subgroup inducing integer shifts on the charge lattice .",
    "this group is the u - duality group and was proposed to extend to a nonperturbative quantum symmetry of m - theory .    to make u - duality transformations `` manageable '' in @xmath14 , the * 56",
    "* representation needs to be addressed .",
    "this can be done by an embedding into @xmath15 using freudenthal s realization of exceptional lie algebras @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 generators are given by @xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "their commutators are given in @xcite .",
    "defining the basis ^t = ( -e^*_|i|j9 , + e^1 _",

    "the basis ( [ rep2 ] ) can therefore be used to study u - duality transformations on @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as well as its subgroups t - duality and s - duality .",
    "what are the generators of @xmath25 ? using the fact that the @xmath26 representation of @xmath10 is the unique minimal representation of @xmath10 , it may be proven using the birkhoff decomposition of lie groups that the subgroup of @xmath10 inducing integer shifts on the lattice defined by @xmath27 is generated by `` fundamental unipotents '' to @xmath28 .",
    "] , that is , the action of the discrete subgroup is spanned by exponentiating the chevalley generators for all positive and negative roots . from these",
    ", @xmath29 and @xmath30 generators may be built parallel to @xmath31 , the latter carrying a representation of the weyl group modulo @xmath32 .",
    "this together with the basis @xmath27 yields contact to the algebraic approach to m - theory , and it may be shown that the two approaches are equivalent .    since the notion of the above generators is representation independent , the discrete u - duality groups of higher dimensional theories follow directly from truncating the dynkin diagram .",
    "their representations are minimal and can be read off from @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath1 theory is known to have classical @xmath33 symmetry . as",
    "only scalars remain in the theory , the notion of electric charge seems ill defined and the meaning of a duality symmetry seems unclear .",
    "therefore , in order to define u - duality in @xmath1 , a method proposed in @xcite parallel to @xcite may be extended to m - theory . by compactifying m - theory on the torus , we can choose eight different ways how to compactify first to four dimensions .",
    "this results in eight @xmath25 s acting _ differently _ on m - theory fields . by reducing the theory further to three dimensions",
    ", these groups are merged together to form the three dimensional duality group .",
    "the reduction to @xmath1 yields a scalar coset matrix of the form ^(3 ) = v^(4 ) ( 12  _ i=1 ^ 8 h_i ) ( y ) ( f  e^1 _  9 ) .",
    "[ 3de7 ] @xmath34 is identical to @xmath24 , but now in the * 248 * adjoint representation of @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath35 obeys @xmath36 and therefore carries the @xmath14 charges , where @xmath37 is the compact fourth direction . @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the @xmath1 dilaton and dualized kk field strength respectively , and @xmath40 represents the @xmath17 cartan subalgebra .",
    "a @xmath41 transformation acts on @xmath34 and @xmath35 exactly as discussed in the last section .",
    "it therefore represents the @xmath14 u - duality in @xmath1 . completing a circle around vortex solutions in @xmath1",
    "may be seen to correspond to an @xmath25 action on the fields , parallel to @xcite .",
    "the different compactifications yield 8 different coset matrices in @xmath1 . using explicitly the connection to m - theory fields",

    "n where @xmath42 is a local transformation restoring upper triangular parameterization , @xmath43 corresponds to a weyl reflection and @xmath44 corresponds to a charge conjugation in @xmath14 .",
    "denoting the @xmath14 u - duality generators of the @xmath45th compactification by @xmath46 , the total @xmath1 u - duality is given by joining all generators      for all @xmath45 .",
    "this can be seen to yield the whole @xmath47 defined by exponentiating all chevalley generators .",
    "the intersection of two different @xmath14 u - dualities is seen to be @xmath48 as expected .",
    "this determines u - duality in @xmath1 .",
    "the described method to generate @xmath1 u - duality can also be applied to five dimensional simple supergravity as toy model , which upon reduction to three dimensions exhibits a @xmath49 global symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is known that this theory closely resembles @xmath4 supergravity in many respects and corresponds to a direct truncation .",
    "the analogue of u - duality in @xmath14 is @xmath31 , acting in the spin 3/2 representation .    here",
    ", the joint u - duality @xmath50 in @xmath1 is strictly smaller than @xmath51 defined by exponentiating the chevalley generators for all roots .",
    "all generators of @xmath50 correspond to short roots of @xmath51 . that the groups do not agree is therefore connected to the fact that @xmath49 is not simply laced .",
    "since no string compactification described by this no - moduli supergravity at low energies is known , one can not determine which group is the `` correct '' u - duality group until such a description has been found ."
