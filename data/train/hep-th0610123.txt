    "noncommutative geometry ( ncg ) or simply noncommutativity of coordinates , is a very old idea @xcite .",
    "the use of ncg in string theory was initiated for the first time by witten @xcite and recently , through the original work carried out by connes , douglas and schwartz @xcite , this idea took a new dash in mathematics and physics .",
    "several important contributions on ncg followed these seminal works @xcite , we refer the readers to the textbooks @xcite for general references on ncg and string theory .",
    "we are focusing to contribute to this very relevant research subject by using the moyal momentum noncommutativity @xcite and its various applications in @xmath0 integrability and conformal symmetry .",
    "we suggest then an interpretation of the noncommutative ( @xmath1 kdv and @xmath2 boussinesq)-burger s mappings @xcite by implementing the famous idea of zeeman effect .",
    "this interpretation starts to emit signs of rigor and reliability by means of the bs construction @xcite which we are engaging in our approach .",
    "the original idea to incorporate the zeeman effect in the formalism of moyal noncommutativity in connection with certain aspects of @xmath0 integrable models and string - brane theories requires , undoubtedly , a particular interest .",
    "more research s works in this direction will be focused in future occasions .",
    "let s first start by specifying the nature of objects used in this work .",
    "the functions often involved in the two dimensional phase - space are arbitrary functions which we generally indicate by @xmath3 with coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 . with respect to this phase space , we have to define the following objects :    * 1*. the constants @xmath6 defined such that @xmath7    * 2*. the functions @xmath8 depending on an infinite set of variables @xmath9 with @xmath10 the index @xmath11 , stands for the conformal weight of the field @xmath12 .",
    "these functions can be considered in the complex language framework as being the analytic ( conformal ) fields of conformal spin @xmath13 .    *",
    "3*. other objects that we will use are given by @xmath14 these are objects of conformal weight @xmath15 living on the non - commutative space parametrized by @xmath16 . throughout this work",
    ", we will use the following convention notations : @xmath17=i$ ] , @xmath18=0 $ ] , and @xmath19=[\\partial _ { x}]=-[x]=1 $ ] , where the symbol @xmath20 @xmath21 $ ] stands for the conformal dimension of the enclosed object .    *",
    "4*. the star product law defining the multiplication of objects in the non - commutative space is shown to satisfy the following expression @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "* 5*. the moyal bracket is defined as @xmath24    * 6*. in order to distinguish the classical objects from the @xmath16-deformed ones , we consider the following convention notations : a ) @xmath25 : is the space of momentum lax differential operators of conformal spin @xmath26 and degrees @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "typical operators of this space are given by @xmath29b ) @xmath30 : is the space of coefficient functions @xmath31 of conformal spin @xmath26 ; @xmath32 , which may depend on the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "it coincides in the standard limit , @xmath33 , with the ring of analytic fields involved in the construction of conformal symmetry and @xmath34-extensions.c ) @xmath35 : is the space of momentum operators of type @xmath36 * 7*. * the  * @xmath16-*leibnitz rules*@xcite @xmath37and @xmath38where @xmath39 is the prime derivative .",
    "few examples are given by    @xmath40    and @xmath41    a convenient description consists in using the complex language notation in which we define the two dimensional euclidean space parametrized by @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in this notation , the currents of conformal weights @xmath44 are simply written as @xmath45 .",
    "it s then the time to introduce the space of analytic functions of arbitrary conformal spin .",
    "this is the space of completely reducible infinite dimensional @xmath46 lorentz representations that can be written as @xmath47where the @xmath48 s are one dimensional @xmath46 spin @xmath44 irreducible modules .",
    "the upper indices @xmath49 carried by the space @xmath50 are special values of the general indices @xmath51 describing the lowest and highest degrees of lax operators type @xmath52the generators belonging to the space @xmath50 are given by the spin @xmath44 analytic fields .",
    "they may be viewed as analytic maps @xmath53 which associate to each point @xmath54 on the unit circle the fields @xmath55 . for @xmath56 , these fields",
    "can be thought of as the higher spin currents involved in the construction of @xmath57-algebras .",
    "the particular example is given by the spin-2 current @xmath58 intimately associated to the virasoro algebra @xmath59 .",
    "* 9 . the classical limit *",
    "since we are interested in the @xmath16-deformation case , we have to add that the spaces @xmath48 are @xmath60-dependent ; the corresponding @xmath61-algebra is shown to exhibit new properties related to the @xmath16-parameter and reduces to the standard @xmath62-algebra once some special limits are performed . as an example , consider for instance the @xmath63-algebra generalizing the zamolodchikov algebra .",
    "the conserved currents of this extended algebra are shown to take the following form @xmath64which coincides with the classical case once the limit @xmath65 is performed .",
    "it is the convenient limit than we must consider in field theory and integrable systems to assure compatibility with the extended conformal symmetry ( zamolodchikov algebra ) since the standard limit @xmath66 does nt respect this objective",
    "we present in this section an original approach to interpret some results previously established and that concern the mapping between the nc burger s integrable system and the nc deformation of the @xmath67-kdv integrable hierarchies in the moyal momentum space @xcite .",
    "this approach consists in adapting , artfully , the famous idea of zeeman effect to the moyal algebra of nc lax operators to provide an alternative issue and interpretation of some properties that are encountered in the study of nc integrable hierarchies .",
    "let s underline in this context that the presence of the deformation parameter @xmath16 in the moyal algebra is important in the sense that it can leads to identify it with the inverse of the magnetic field @xmath68 , as it 's well known , such that @xmath69 before considering such an application , it s useful to recall some essential basic notions of the zeeman effect as well as the importance of the magnetic field in this context        the following definitions are equivalents : knowing that an atom can be characterized by a unique set of discrete energy states , when excited , the atom makes transitions between these quantized energy states and emits light .",
    "the emitted light is shown to form a discrete spectrum , reflecting the quantized nature of the energy levels . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", these energy levels can shift , this is the zeeman effect .",
    "analogously to the stark effect characterized by the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an electric field , the zeeman effect is defined as been the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the origin of the zeeman effect can be simply presented as follows : let s consider an atomic energy state such that an electron orbits around the nucleus of the atom .",
    "this electron has a magnetic dipole moment associated with its angular momentum . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", the electron acquires an additional energy and consequently the original energy level is shifted .",
    "the energy shifted may be positive , zero , or even negative , depending on the angle between the electron magnetic dipole moment and the field .",
    "we have shown in previous works @xcite how it s possible to establish a correspondence between the @xmath67-kdv nc integrable hierarchies and the nc burger s system .",
    "this issue of mapping exhibits a particular interest because it allows us to install the first steps toward a possible unification of nc integrable models in the moyal momentum framework .    presently , we are interested to study another aspect in relation with the zeeman effect .",
    "the crucial point resides in the nc deformation that provides the possibility to join the parameter of non commutativity @xmath16 with the inverse of the magnetic field @xmath68 . on the basis of this relation , and also on the use of the nc version of the miura transformation which rests on the idea of mapping between burger and @xmath67-kdv systems",
    ", we will see explicitly how a strong analogy emerge between the zeeman effect and what the mapping in question exhibits as consequences .",
    "we guess that the incorporation of the zeeman effect in this context is not a coincidence , we think that some important physical properties are behind .",
    "the starting steps in planting this idea comes from several observations of the behavior of different expressions and also from the primordial role of the nc burger s system and of the @xmath16 parameter whose weight increases proportionally with the order of the @xmath67-kdv hierarchy .",
    "we are going to illustrate these ideas for two particular examples namely the nc kdv and boussinesq s systems .",
    "let us take again the nc kdv - burger s mapping discussed before , we have the following equation @xmath71 or equivalently @xmath72 .    whereas the nc kdv current @xmath73 depends explicitly on the parameter @xmath16 , the burger s current does not have this property since the associated lax operator @xmath74 does not admit a lax operator , whose conformal weight is integer , as a root .",
    "this is also due to the fact that the quantities of non integer conformal weights are not authorized in this framework .",
    "thus from now on , the nc burger s current is regarded as being a fundamental current in term of which all the other currents of the @xmath75-kdv hierarchy are expressed .    *",
    "proposition 1 * :    given the nc miura transformation , binding the nc burger and kdv systems as follows : @xmath76    we can represent this mapping graphically as given by _ fig.1 _ :    -kdv - burger mapping * * ]     + * convention notations * :    for this purpose , we adopt the following diagrammatic representation : we represent symbolically the nc kdv lax operator by a line indexed by the nc kdv current @xmath73 . the splitting of @xmath77 , with respect to the moyal star product , into a pair of nc burger s operators is schematized by two parallel lines which leave , starting from a vertex , the initial kdv line .",
    "the two parallel lines are considered to be associated to the pair of nc burger s operators @xmath78 who appear on the right hand side of the eq.(16 ) .    *",
    "2*. the position of the two emitted lines relative to the burger s operators depends on the sign of the spin 1 burger s currents .",
    "the upper line is associated with @xmath79 while the lower one , associated to negative sign of the nc burger s current @xmath80 , is for @xmath81 .. the initial nc kdv line is thus the result of the star product of the parallel burger s lines .    *",
    "4*. we then specify two zones ; the left one , characterized by the nc kdv initial line where the two burger s levels are in coincidence ( degenerated twice ) .",
    "the other zone on the right is given by two separated lines describing a broken degeneracy .",
    "the passage from the single kdv level to both burger s lines , via the miura transformation or the @xmath82 kdv - burger s mapping , is identical to a lifting of the degeneracy which means also the passage from a configuration with star product to a configuration without star product : @xmath83or equivalently @xmath84 * 5*. in other words , the transition from a single kdv level degenerated twice to a pair of two burger s levels without degeneracy is equivalent to the passage from a phase with a @xmath85 predominance to a phase with magnetic @xmath86 predominance .",
    "parameter acquires a power conversely to the magnetic field @xmath87 which becomes relevant with emission of the pair of nc burger s levels ] at this point , we have to underline the striking analogy with the zeeman effect since it is the presence of a magnetic field who breaks the degeneracy of the initial kdv level .",
    "we showed through this first example that the kdv - burger s mapping is accompanied by a rupture of degeneracy that exhibits the initial nc kdv level .",
    "this lifting of degeneracy is due to the emergence of the magnetic field @xmath68 corresponding to a weakness of the nc deformation parameter @xmath16 during the transition from the single kdv level to the pair of burger s levels .",
    "this behavior is identical to the zeeman effect .      in a similar way , the @xmath2  boussinesq - burger s mapping deals with the following equation @xmath88 :    given the nc miura transformation , binding the nc burger and @xmath89 boussinesq s system as follows @xmath90    we can represent this mapping graphically as shown by _ fig.2 _ :    -boussinesq - burger mapping * * ]     + * convention notations * :    in the same way as for the nc kdv- burger s mapping",
    ", we will adopt the following diagrammatic representations for the @xmath89 boussinesq - burger s splitting :    * 1 .",
    "* we represent symbolically the nc @xmath89 boussinesq lax operator by a line indexed by the pair of currents @xmath91 . the splitting of @xmath92 , with respect to the star product , into a triplet @xmath93 of nc burger s operators is schematized by three parallel lines leaving , from a vertex , the initial @xmath89 boussinesq line .",
    "the position of the three emitted burger s lines depends on the sign of spin 1 burger s currents .",
    "the uppers lines are chosen arbitrarily to be associated to @xmath79 and @xmath94 while the lower line is being associated to the negative sign of the nc burger s current @xmath95 namely to @xmath96 .",
    "* 3 . * as it s shown in eq(19 ) , the initial nc @xmath2 boussinesq line is the result of the star product of the three parallel burger s lines .",
    "* 4 . * the initial single line corresponding to the nc @xmath89 boussinesq s lax operator is characterized by a degeneracy of order 3 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the three nc burger s levels on the right of the vertex _ fig .",
    "2 _ coincide at the level of the nc @xmath89 boussinesq line . when the degeneracy of order three is broken , the three nc burger s levels are emitted .",
    "this emission procedure is given by @xmath97 or equivalently @xmath98 * 5*. the contact with zeeman effect is done as follows : the transition from the initial single nc @xmath2 boussinesq s level , of degeneracy three , to a triplet of nc burger s levels without degeneracy is equivalent to the passage from a phase with a @xmath85 predominance to a phase with magnetic @xmath86 predominance . at this point",
    ", we have to underline the striking analogy with the zeeman effect since it is the presence of a magnetic field who breaks the degeneracy of the initial @xmath89 boussinesq s level.we showed once again through this second example that the @xmath2 boussinesq - burger s mapping is accompanied by a rupture of degeneracy , of order three , that exhibits the initial nc boussinesq s level .",
    "this lifting of degeneracy is due to the emergence of the magnetic field @xmath99 accompanied by an annihilation of the nc deformation parameter @xmath16 during the emission .",
    "this is a clear manifestation of the zeeman effect .    before closing this section",
    ", we present the zeeman splitting for the general case of @xmath67 kdv- burger s mapping as given by _ fig.3 _    -kdv - burger mapping * * ]",
    "it s point out that gauge theories on noncommutative spaces @xcite are relevant to the quantization of d - branes in background @xmath100 fields @xcite .",
    "such theories are shown to be similar to ordinary gauge theory except that the usual product of fields is replaced by a `` star product '' that is well defined through the deformation parameter @xmath101 which is an antisymmetric constant tensor .",
    "the authors of @xcite show on a successful way , by means of simple examples and of a convenient mathematical formulation , that the noncommutativity is once again appearing as a rephrasing of well known physics , namely the physics of the magnetic field .",
    "the principal focus of this section is to recall a part of the bs construction before considering an adaptation of their results to our study . for this propose",
    ", we will begin by recalling this construction based first on a simple quantum mechanical system , a fundamental steps , before considering the string theory in the presence of a d3-brane and a constant large @xmath100 field .",
    "it deals with a system of two unit charges of opposite sign connected by a spring with elastic constant @xmath102 .",
    "the system is embedded in a magnetic field @xmath68 in the regime where the coulomb and the radiation terms are negligible .",
    "the charges are associated to particles of masse @xmath26 and charge @xmath103 and they are localized at the coordinates @xmath104 and @xmath105 or in component form @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the lagrangian of this system is given by @xmath108 the first term @xmath109 is the kinetic energy of the charges.the second term @xmath110 describes the interaction of the charges with the magnetic field @xmath68 and the last term @xmath111 is known to be the harmonic potential between the charges .    by virtue of this particular limit , the previous lagrangian reduces to @xmath112 from the classical mechanic s point of view , the canonical momenta are given by @xmath113 and the corresponding hamiltonian is deduced from the reduced lagrangian as follows @xmath114 once the center of mass and relative coordinates @xmath115 , @xmath116 are defined as : @xmath117 one learns from eq(29 ) that @xmath118 is the hamiltonian of a nonrelativistic particle with mass @xmath119 and center of mass momentum , conjugate to @xmath115 , given by @xmath120 with @xmath121 as it s claimed by the authors of @xcite , this lagrangian exhibits a particular interest since an identical expression can be extracted from string theory s point of view .",
    "the induced message is that a quantum of ncym can be described as an unexcited string relating the particles of opposite charges inside a strong magnetic field.on the other hand , the interesting consequence of the non locality as expressed by the behavior of open string endpoints on d - brane world volume @xmath122=i\\theta^{ij}\\ ] ] is the existence of dipole excitation @xcite whose content is expressed by @xmath123 eq(32 ) .",
    "one learns from this relation that the spatial extension @xmath124 of the system is proportional to its momentum @xmath125 in the orthogonal direction .",
    "this proportionality shows that the size of the system is growing linearly with the momentum which is also equivalent to boost the system along a direction while it will spread in the orthogonal one leading simply to conclude that the particle is not any more point - like .",
    "the principal task of this section is to show that string theory analysis reproduces the same behavior of the lagrangian corresponding to the classical model .",
    "in fact , let s consider a bosonic string theory in the presence of a d3-brane oriented along the coordinates @xmath126 .",
    "we have also a background antisymmetric tensor field @xmath127 in the 1 , 2 direction in light cone frame defined as follows @xmath128 with the usual light cone choice of world sheet time @xmath129    focusing on the large limit for the magnetic field , namely @xmath130 , the string action can be reduced , upon some rescalings and straightforward manipulations , to the following form @xcite    @xmath131 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this lagrangian shows a striking resemblance with the one of classical mechanics , see eq(33 ) .",
    "we guess that a strong link should exists between the @xmath75 kdv- burger s mapping with the interpretation provided through the zeeman effect , on one hand , and the bs construction from the other hand .    indeed , the consideration of the authors of @xcite of the simple classical model dealing with a pair of particles of opposite charges embedded in a strong magnetic field and moving on the infinite noncommutative @xmath0 plane is of great interest because of the remarkable similarity with the behavior of the bosonic string theory in the presence of a @xmath132-brane .",
    "we focus in what follows to use and adapt some important results presented in the bs construction that we reviewed previously .",
    "our principal focus is to be able to interpret the zeeman approach of the @xmath75 kdv burger s mapping .",
