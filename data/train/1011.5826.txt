    "the class of static cylindrically symmetric vacuum solutions , which was found by levi - civita in 1919 [ 1 ] , can be written in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 may be interpreted as the mass per unit length of the source located along the axis @xmath3 , while @xmath4 is the conicity parameter ( see [ 2 ] for more details ) . when @xmath5 , minkowski space in cylindrical coordinates is recovered .    in 1986 , a generalisation of ( [ levicivita ] ) to include a non - zero cosmological constant  @xmath6 was obtained by linet  [ 3 ] and tian  [ 4 ] ( see also [ 5 ] ) in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a proper radial distance from the axis and @xmath9 both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are admitted ( in the latter case the trigonometric functions are replaced by hyperbolic ones and @xmath12 by @xmath13 ) .",
    "the metric ( [ linettianmetric ] ) , ( [ pqdefs ] ) locally approaches the levi - civita solution ( [ levicivita ] ) either as @xmath14 or near the axis as @xmath15 because @xmath16 and @xmath17 in these limits .",
    "in order to understand the global geometrical properties of the linet  tian solution , it seems to be important first to rewrite the _ maximally symmetric _",
    "3-spaces in cylindrical - like coordinates .",
    "such constant - curvature spaces are usually written in the spherical form @xmath18 where @xmath19 corresponds to the geometries of @xmath20 , respectively ( as is well - known from the flrw cosmology ) . performing the transformation @xmath21",

    "there are thus _ two _ nonintersecting circular axes at @xmath39 and @xmath40 around the closed space @xmath30 .",
    "this can be explicitly seen from the parametrisation of @xmath30 as the 3-surface @xmath41 in a flat space @xmath42 .",

    "apart from the cosmological constant  @xmath12 , the metric has three parameters : @xmath50 , @xmath4 and @xmath54 .",
    "there are curvature singularities along the `` axes '' @xmath3 and @xmath55 , with the deficit angles @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the weak - field limit .    either of these two singularities can be removed and specific values of @xmath50 and @xmath4 can be established , for example , by _ matching _ this vacuum solution across a surfaces on which @xmath8 is constant ( @xmath58 ) to a corresponding _ toroidal region of the einstein static universe_. this well - known homogeneous and isotropic dust - filled universe has the spatial geometry of @xmath30 with radius @xmath59 and thus , using the toroidal coordinates of ( [ 3spherecyl ] ) , can be written in the form @xmath60 for convenience , we applied a simple transformation @xmath61 and introduced the free constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( see [ 5 ] ) .",
    "usual matching conditions , namely that the metrics ( [ linettianmetric2 ] ) and ( [ einstein ] ) and their first derivatives are continuous across the surface @xmath58 , can indeed be consistently satisfied when @xmath64 which uniquely determine @xmath65 in terms of @xmath66}$ ] and relate @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",

    "it is now straightforward to calculate the total mass of such a toroidal dust source of density @xmath73 , yielding @xmath74 .",
    "the _ mass per unit length _ of the toroid is thus @xmath75 , i.e. , it is determined just by the parameter @xmath54 .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath54 in the linet ",
