    "by the discovery of a higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , the standard model ( sm ) has been completed .",
    "so far , within the error properties of the observed boson are consistent with those of the higgs boson in the sm such as the mass , the cp parity and the signal strengths .",
    "thus , the discovered boson can be regarded as the sm - like higgs boson @xmath1 .",
    "however , this fact does not necessarily mean that the sm is correct in a fundamental level , because the sm - like higgs boson can be described not only in the minimal higgs sector with only one isospin scalar doublet but also in non - minimal higgs sectors .",
    "in fact , the minimal higgs sector of the sm is nothing but an assumption without any principle .",
    "in addition , non - minimal higgs sectors often appear in physics models beyond the sm in which several unsolved problems such as neutrino oscillation , the existence of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe within the sm are tried to be explained .",
    "therefore , non - minimal higgs sectors ( e.g. , with additional singlets , doublets and/or triplets ) should be comprehensively studied to determine the true structure of the higgs sector and to probe new physics models .    in extended higgs sectors",
    ", the higgs boson coupling constants can be deviated from the corresponding sm predictions .",
    "in addition , a pattern of the deviations strongly depends on properties of the higgs sector ; i.e. , the number of higgs fields and their quantum numbers . therefore , by @xmath6 , i.e. , by comparing the deviations in various higgs boson couplings with the theory predictions , we can extract the structure of the higgs sector .",
    "the higgs boson couplings will be measured at future colliders as precisely as possible .",
    "for example , the @xmath4 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) couplings are supposed to be measured with approximately @xmath3 and @xmath9 accuracies at the lhc with the collision energy to be 14 tev and the integrated luminosity to be 300  fb@xmath10 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are expected to be measured with typically @xmath11 at the international linear collider ( ilc ) with the collision energy to be @xmath12 gev and the integrated luminosity to be @xmath12 fb@xmath10  @xcite .    in this letter , we calculate deviations in the yukawa couplings from the sm predictions in two higgs doublet models ( thdms ) at the one - loop level , especially focusing on those for the sm - like higgs boson @xmath1 .",
    "thdms are a simple but well - motivated example for extended higgs sectors .",
    "first , the electroweak rho parameter is naturally predicted to be unity at the tree level , whose experimental value is close to unity ; i.e. , @xmath13  @xcite . in the other extended higgs sectors such as higgs triplet models ,",
    "the rho parameter is not guaranteed to be unity at the tree level .",
    "although even in the thdms the rho parameter can deviate from unity due to the one - loop correction  @xcite , its amount can easy be within the error of the measurement .",
    "second , the higgs sector in several new physics models has the structure of the thdm .",
    "for example , the supersymmetry requires at least two higgs doublets .",
    "neutrino mass models such as radiative seesaw models  @xcite and the neutrinophilic model  @xcite contain two higgs doublet fields in their higgs sector .",
    "the hierarchy between top and bottom quark masses may be naturally explained in the thdm  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , additional cp violating phases can appear , and the strong first order electroweak phase transition can occur due to nondecoupling effects of extra scalar bosons .",
    "these characteristics are required to realize the successful electroweak baryogenesis scenario  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of various classes of the thdm is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "unlike the sm , in multi - doublet models , the mass matrix for fermions and the interaction matrix among a neutral higgs boson and fermions can not be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "that causes flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at the tree level , which are severely constrained from flavor experiments such as @xmath14 , @xmath15-@xmath16 mixing and so on . in order to avoid the tree level fcnc ,",
    "a discrete @xmath2 symmetry  @xcite may be imposed as the simplest way .",
    "if we consider the case with the softly - broken @xmath2 symmetry symmetric thdm is known as the inert doublet model  @xcite .",
    "] , there are four independent types of yukawa interactions under the different charge assignments to quarks and charged leptons  @xcite .",
    "we call them type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y thdms  @xcite . a lot of phenomenological studies in these thdms have been performed before the higgs boson discovery  @xcite and after that  @xcite . each type of thdms can be related to various new physics models . for example",
    ", the higgs sector in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) corresponds to the type - ii thdm with supersymmetric relations . on the other hand ,",
    "the type - x thdm is applied to radiative seesaw models  @xcite .",
    "therefore , discrimination of the types of yukawa interactions in the thdm is important to test new physics models .    in order to compare",
    "precisely measured higgs boson couplings as mentioned above , we need to prepare precise calculations of the higgs boson couplings in various higgs sectors .",
    "namely , it is essentially important to take into account the effects of radiative corrections .",
    "so far , there are several studies of one - loop calculations for the higgs boson couplings in various versions of the thdm .",
    "one - loop corrections to the triple higgs boson coupling @xmath17  @xcite and yukawa couplings  @xcite have been calculated in the mssm  higgs sector . in the softly - broken @xmath2 symmetric",
    "thdm , the @xmath17 and @xmath4 couplings have also been calculated at the one - loop level in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , one - loop corrected yukawa couplings have not been systematically analysed in the four types of thdms .",
