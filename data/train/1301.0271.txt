    "late time evolution of stars due to strong gravity have been an interesting investigating field in astrophysics which let us know , via several physical processes , features of diverse characters of gravitating objects .",
    "so we actually come across a paradigm shift from the stage of normal stars to compact stars , ranging from dwarf stars to neutron stars , quark stars , dark stars , gravastars and eventually black holes .",
    "however , in the present study we are specifically interested for compact starnge stars category .    in connection to compact stars",
    "it have been shown by several workers @xcite that the krori and barua @xcite ( henceforth kb ) spacetime provides an effective platform for modelling quark and strange type compact stars .",
    "some of the interesting works to be mentioned with kb metric have been carried out by rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite for singularity - free dark energy stars which represents an anisotropic compact steller configuration with @xmath0  km radius whereas the same kb spacetime with mit bag model was considered by rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite to describe ultra - compact object like strange star with radius of @xmath1  km .",
    "kalam et al .",
    "@xcite also proposed a model for strange quark stars within the framework of mit bag model .",
    "this model clearly indicates that the bag constant need not necessarily lie within the range of @xmath2 as claimed in the literature .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a model for an anisotropic compact star where it is assumed that the radial pressure exerted on the system is proportional to the matter density .",
    "the stellar configuration , therefore , comprises of two fluids - an ordinary baryonic matter together with an yet unknown form of matter ( i.e. dark energy of einstein - type varying cosmological constant ) which is repulsive in nature .",
    "these two fluids are assumed to be non - interacting amongst themselves with the radial and transverse directional anisotropic property such that @xmath3 @xcite . in favour of anisotropy",
    "we would like to point out that for fluid configuration this is not only natural but also obvious general option for describing relativistic compact stellar objects @xcite ( also see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "recent observational evidences on highly compact astrophysical objects like x - ray pulsar @xmath4 , x - ray buster @xmath5 , millisecond pulsar @xmath6 , x - ray sources @xmath7 etc .",
    "strongly favour an anisotropic pressure distributions in the case of an ultra - compact object .",
    "the mechanism at the microscopic level , though not yet well understood , may be related to variety of reasons such as the existence of type @xmath8 superfluid , mixture of two fluids , phase transition , pion condensation , bosonic composition , rotation , magnetic field etc .",
    "as mentioned above that basically we have considered here a two fluids model for compact star with @xmath9-dark energy as one of the ingradients .",
    "this consideration has been motivated by the recent observations on the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "it is argued that about @xmath10 of the energy content of the universe is of gravitationally repulsive in nature ( _ dark energy _ ) @xcite . as a result ,",
    "cosmological models based on dark energy received much attention in the recent past either in the form of a non - zero cosmological constant ( present value , @xmath11 @xcite ) or in some other exotic forms of matter .",
    "however , in the astrophysical realm dark energy may have implications not only with a pure cosmological constant @xcite but also a varying cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "it has essentially been speculated that within a very massive dense star and/or galaxy a constant @xmath9 may have substantial effect and in the case of a space varying @xmath9 vary strengthwise from centre to boundary and decreases to extremly small non - zero value ( @xmath12 ) outside the system . in this connection",
    "we quote from bambi @xcite as he argues that `` the cosmological constant problem represents an evident tension between our present description of gravity and particle physics .",
    "many solutions have been proposed , but experimental tests are always difficult or impossible to perform and the present phenomenological investigations focus only on possible relations with the dark energy , that is with the accelerating expansion rate of the contemporary universe . ... strange stars , if they exist , could represent an interesting laboratory to investigate this puzzle , since their equilibrium configuration is partially determined by the qcd vacuum energy density '' .",
    "we would like to mention here the very recent work of hossein et al .",
    "@xcite where the authors have assumed cosmological constant with radial dependence i.e. @xmath13 to describe non - singular model for anisotropic compact stars under the kb spacetime . in the present work we are essentially following the same root however with a quite different motivation .",
    "our sole aim here is to find out a set of exact solution which is completely free from singularity ( at @xmath14 ) and all the parameters involved in the solutions depend only on the central density ( @xmath15 ) of the stellar interior .",
    "this then facilitates one to explore different physical parameters from a single parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the plan of the present paper is as follows : in sec ii we have provided the basic equations in connection to the proposed model for strange star .",
    "iii is dealt for finding out a class of exact solution for the steller interior of kb metric .",
    "stability of the model is shown in sec .",
    "iv whereas mass - radius relation and hence redshift calculation are done in sec .",
    "v. some concluding remarks are made in sec .",
    "to describe the spacetime of a compact stellar configuration , we consider the metric of kb @xcite as given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are arbitrary constants to be determined on physical grounds .",
    "we further assume that the energy - momentum tensor for the strange matter filling the interior of the star may be expressed in the following standard form as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to respectively the energy density , radial pressure and transverse pressure of the baryonic matter .",
    "the einstein field equations in the presence of @xmath9 can as usual be written as @xmath26 where the erstwhile cosmological constant @xmath9 is assumed to be space - dependent so that @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 under geometrized relativistic units .",
    "in this model we propose that the radial pressure of a star is proportional to the matter density in the following form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is any ` + ve ' real with the equation of state parameter @xmath31 . here",

    "the matter density , radial pressure and transverse pressure of the star under consideration is entirely free from any singularity at @xmath14 .",
    "\\(2 ) at any distance from the center all the physical parameters completely depend only on the central density . in a similar way",
    "this also implies that the measure of anisotropy ( @xmath46 ) and equation of state parameters ( @xmath47 and @xmath47 ) are central density dependent .",
    "therefore , we can conclude taht at any distance from the center of the star , these are exactly measurable once we know the central density alone .",
    "these results are shown graphically in the figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "one can see that at @xmath14 , the density becoms the central density @xmath15 itself .",

    "now , to examine the stability of local anisotropic matter distribution , we use herrera s @xcite _ cracking _ ( also known as _ overturning _ ) concept which states that the region for which radial speed of sound is greater than the transverse speed of sound is a potentially stable region . in our case ,",
    "6 indicates that there is no change of sign for the term @xmath60 within the specific region of the configuration .",
    "this implies that the kb - type strange star model is a stable one if the radius of the star is @xmath61  km . from the fig .",
    "7 it is evident that if radius of a star is @xmath62  km then the central density should be @xmath63 [ approx ] to be stable according to our proposed model .",
    "in this section , we study the maximum allowable mass - radius ratio in our model . for a static spherically symmetric perfect fluid star , buchdahl @xcite showed that the maximally allowable mass - radius ratio is given by @xmath64 ( for a more generalized expression for the same see ref .",

    "keeping in mind that stars can be treated as self - gravitating fluid we have proposed a very simple and unique model for an anisotropic star .",
    "the spacetime here is of kb - type @xcite which is supposed to present compact strange stars solutions @xcite .",
    "it is shown through the solution set that ( 1 ) the central density @xmath15 being a non - zero constant quantity the star is non - singular at @xmath14 , and ( 2 ) interior physical properties of a compact star solely depend on the central density of the stable steller configuration . thus if we know the _ mass - radius ratio _ then all the interior features of a star can be exactly evaluated at any position of the interior of that star .",
    "further it may be observed that if we know the central density and radius of a star then assuming the spherical structure we can say that matter distribution follow a regular behavioural pattern whatever the size of a star may be .",
    "we also show that the central density is proportoinately low for bigger star .    as a final comment , following the introductory discussion regarding inclusion of cosmological constant in the source term of einstein field equations as one of the candidates of dark energy",
