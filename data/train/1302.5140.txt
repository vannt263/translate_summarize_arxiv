    "recent interest and progress in the theory of spin - orbital superexchange models was triggered by the observation that orbital degeneracy drastically increases quantum fluctuations ( qf ) which may suppress long - range order in the regime of strong competition between different types of ordered states near the quantum critical point.@xcite the simplest and archetypical three - dimensional ( 3d ) model for the spin - orbital physics is the kugel ",
    "khomskii ( kk ) model introduced for kcuf@xmath4 by kugel and khomskii long ago.@xcite kcuf@xmath4 is a strongly correlated system with a single hole within degenerate @xmath5 orbitals at each cu@xmath6 ion .",
    "kugel and khomskii showed that interactions between strongly correlated electrons could then stabilize orbital order by a purely electronic mechanism , the superexchange .",
    "a similar situation occurs in a number of compounds with active orbital degrees of freedom , where strong on - site coulomb interactions localize electrons ( or holes ) and give rise to spin - orbital superexchange .",
    "@xcite    the orbital superexchange may stabilize the orbital order by itself , but in @xmath5 systems it is usually helped by the jahn - teller distortions of the lattice which generate effective intersite orbital interactions .",
    "@xcite for instance , in lamno@xmath4 the terms that originate from the superexchange and the jahn - teller distortions are of equal importance and both are necessary to explain the observed high temperature @xmath7 of the structural transition.@xcite also in kcuf@xmath4 the lattice distortions play an important role @xcite and are responsible for its strongly anisotropic magnetic and optical properties .",
    "the latest theoretical and experimental results for this compound show that other types of interactions , like goodenough processes in the superexchange,@xcite direct orbital exchange driven by a combination of electron  electron interactions and ligand distortions , @xcite or dynamical dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction,@xcite are necessary to explain structural phase transition in kcuf@xmath4 at @xmath8 and peculiarities in spin dynamics.@xcite the compound itself is believed to be the best realization of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg model above the nel temperature @xmath9,@xcite and spinon excitations were indeed observed in neutron scattering.@xcite    while the coexisting @xmath3-type af ( @xmath3-af ) order and the orbital order are well established in kcuf@xmath4 below the nel temperature @xmath10 k,@xcite and this phase is reproduced by the spin - orbital @xmath11 superexchange model in the mean field ( mf ) approximation,@xcite the phase diagram of this model is still unknown beyond the mf approach because of strongly coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom@xcite which poses an outstanding question in the theory : which types of coexisting spin and orbital order ( or disorder ) are possible when its microscopic parameters ( splitting of the @xmath12 orbitals @xmath13 and hund s exchange @xmath14 ) are varied ?",
    "so far , it was suggested that the long - range af order is destroyed by spin - orbital qf,@xcite but another possibility that the ordered state might be stabilized by the order - out - of - disorder mechanism was also pointed out in the regime of ferro - orbital ( fo ) order of @xmath15 orbitals.@xcite an alternative to magnetic order are spin - disordered phases with pronounced valence - bond spin - orbital correlations , as suggested by simple variational wave functions.@xcite    the purpose of this paper is to investigate the phase diagram of the 3d kk model , in the presence of spin - orbital qf .",
    "this subject is of interest in the broad context of frustration in magnetic systems,@xcite which appears to be intrinsic for the orbital superexchange.@xcite to establish reliable results concerning short - range order in the crossover regime between phases with long - range af or ferromagnetic ( fm ) order , we developed a _",
