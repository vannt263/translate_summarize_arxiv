    "in spite of the excellent agreement of the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) with experimental observables , there is still a strong physical motivation for the presence of new physics at the weak scale .",
    "the main reason is the belief that the higgs mechanism of the sm is only an effective description of a more fundamental mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking , in which the origin and stability of the electroweak scale must be explained .",
    "supersymmetric extensions of the sm  @xcite allow such a mechanism .",
    "in the simplest extensions of the sm , the theory remains perturbative up to scales of the order of the planck scale and the weak scale is stable under quantum corrections at all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , the electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively , providing a correlation between the weak scale and the soft supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "another strong motivation is a solution to the problem of dark matter .",
    "if a discrete symmetry , r - parity , is imposed in the theory , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable . in the simplest models ,",
    "it is also neutral and weakly interacting , with an annihilation cross section of the order of the one necessary for the lsp to become a good dark matter candidate .",
    "it has been also realized that supersymmetry may also lead to a solution of another outstanding cosmological problem , namely , the baryon - antibaryon asymmetry  @xcite . in the mssm ,",
    "a solution to this problem by weak scale physics demands a light stop as well as non - vanishing cp - violating phases in the chargino ",
    ". the presence of a light stop , with mass smaller than the top quark mass , tends to push the lightest cp - even higgs mass to values close to the ones restricted by experimental searches .",
    "therefore , this scenario is highly constrained and it will be probed at the tevatron and the lhc colliders in the near future , as well as in electric dipole moment and direct dark matter searches  @xcite and the ilc  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry also plays a relevant role for the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the so - called soft leptogenesis scenario , which again demands very specific values for the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters in the neutrino sector  @xcite , which can be naturally obtained only in certain supersymmetry breaking scenarios  @xcite .",
    "a less constrained solution to the baryon asymmetry may be found within extensions of the mssm with additional chiral singlet superfields . in particular , it has been recently shown that a particularly simple extension of the mssm , the so - called nmssm  @xcite includes all the relevant properties to lead to a successful generation of the baryon asymmetry at the weak scale  @xcite , without the need of light squarks and with values of the lightest cp - even higgs mass which are naturally above the current experimental bound  @xcite .",
    "one interesting feature of the nmssm is that the lightest neutralino is usually an admixture of the fermion component of the singlet field and the higgsinos . due to the absence of explicit mass terms in the higgsino ",
    "singlino sector , its mass is bounded to be below 70 gev . a relaxation of this upper bound may only be obtained by allowing the trilinear higgs - singlet coupling to become strong at scales lower than the grand unification ( gut ) scale , as happens in the so - called fat higgs models and gauge extensions of the nmssm  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we shall demand perturbative consistency of the theory up to the gut scale , and therefore the aforementioned bound applies . for light neutralinos ,",
    "the annihilation cross section is dominated by s - channel @xmath0 boson exchange and a neutralino relic density consistent with all experimental bounds , may only be obtained for values of the neutralino mass of about 3045 gev .",
    "such a light neutralino has relevant phenomenological consequences .",
    "for instance , the lightest cp - even higgs tends to decay predominantly into neutralinos , leading to invisible signatures at hadron and lepton colliders  @xcite .",
    "moreover , one of the predictions of this model is the presence of relatively light charginos and neutralinos with masses smaller than about 200 gev .",
    "detection of these weakly interacting particles at hadron colliders becomes difficult if there are no strongly interacting superpartners with masses below the tev scale .",
    "assuming that the relevant cp - violating phases are in the gaugino masses , successful baryogenesis may be easily achieved for weak - scale gaugino masses of the order of 100300 gev , and at least one relatively light squark in order to avoid the so - called giudice - shaposhnikov suppression of chiral charges  @xcite .",
    "we will assume the presence of top and bottom squarks with masses of order of 500 gev , and the presence of a gluino with mass dictated by the gaugino mass unification condition .",
    "the phenomenological properties at hadron colliders depend strongly on these last assumptions .",
    "in addition to discussing the prospects for discovery of the light higgs and superpartner states at the lhc , we will perform a detailed phenomenological analysis of nmssm physics at the ilc . in this case",
    "the values of the strongly interacting particle masses become less important .",
    "the same is true for the analysis of the direct dark matter detection properties and the constraints coming from the bounds on the electron electric dipole moments that we investigate in this work .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sc : nmssm ]",
    "we present an overview of the nmssm and present experimental constraints to define a benchmark scenario for the model . in section [ sc : coll ] we analyze the corresponding collider phenomenology at the lhc and the ilc , which we then connect with the cosmology constraints related to the dark matter relic density and baryogenesis in section [ sc : cosmo ] .",
    "in particular , we present the constraints coming from direct searches of dark matter and the non - observation of an electron electric dipole moment .",
    "we reserve section [ sc : concl ] for our conclusions .",
    "one of the original motivations for a singlet extension of the mssm is the difficulty to explain why the @xmath1-parameter in the superpotential is of order of the electroweak scale , instead of the gut or planck scale .",
    "this problem is circumvented by introducing a singlet chiral superfield @xmath2 , and generating a weak - scale @xmath1-parameter through the vacuum expectation value of the scalar component @xmath3 of the singlet .",
    "this requires the inclusion of a triple - higgs coupling term @xmath4 in the superpotential , where @xmath5 are the superfields of the two higgs doublets , @xmath6 this triple - higgs coupling also helps to push up the mass of the cp - even higgs boson responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking , so that the bound from lep , @xmath7  @xcite , can be satisfied without substantial fine tuning . finally , the new contribution increases the strength of the electroweak phase transition , thus allowing the possibility of electroweak baryogenesis in a large region of parameter space @xcite .    in a general singlet extension ,",
    "the superpotential can also contain a triple - self - coupling , a mass term and a tadpole term for @xmath2 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the @xmath10 yukawa coupling matrices .    in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , a discrete @xmath11 symmetry",
    "is imposed , which forbids the tadpole and mass terms and only leaves dimensionless couplings in the superpotential .",
    "however , once the singlet scalar acquires a vacuum expectation value , the @xmath11 symmetry is broken and unacceptable domain walls can be generated @xcite .    in the nearly minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , a @xmath12 or @xmath13 r",
    "- symmetry is introduced in the superpotential and the khler potential , which forbids quadratic and cubic self - interactions of the singlet .",
    "however , at higher loop orders , a tadpole term is induced due to supergravity effects .",
    "it is suppressed at the six ( @xmath12 ) or seven ( @xmath13 ) loop level , so that it is naturally of weak - scale order and does not destabilize the hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the discrete symmetries also ensure that rapid proton decay does not occur , while majorana neutrino masses are allowed .",
    "furthermore the lightest supersymmetric particle , usually the lightest neutralino , is quasi - stable on cosmological time - scales @xcite , even without the introduction of r - parity .",

    ", the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can in general be complex .",
    "however , the phase of @xmath15 does not generate physical cp - violating effects , since it can be made real by suitable gauge rotations @xcite .",
    "as in the standard model , the yukawa couplings @xmath18 lead to one physical phase in the ckm quark mixing matrix , which is constrained by present data from many heavy - flavor experiments",

    "<S> low energy supersymmetric models provide a solution to the hierarchy problem and also have the necessary ingredients to solve two of the most outstanding issues in cosmology : the origin of dark matter and baryonic matter . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most attractive features of this framework is that the relevant physical processes are related to interactions at the weak scale and therefore may be tested in collider experiments in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> this is true for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) as well as for its extension with the addition of one singlet chiral superfield , the so - called nmssm . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently shown that within the nmssm an elegant solution to both the problem of baryogenesis and dark matter may be found , that relies mostly on the mixing of the singlet sector with the higgs sector of the theory . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we review the nmssm model constraints from cosmology and present the associated collider phenomenology at the lhc and the ilc . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ilc will efficiently probe the neutralino , chargino and higgs sectors , allowing to confront cosmological observations with computations based on collider measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the prospects for a direct detection of dark matter and the constraints imposed by the current bounds of the electron electric dipole moment in this model . </S>"
