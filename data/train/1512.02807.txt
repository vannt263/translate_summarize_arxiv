    "* theorem 10.2.2 ) .",
    "+ however , in applications one is frequently confronted with sdes where @xmath6 is non - lipschitz , e.g. , in stochastic control theory .",
    "the question of existence and uniqueness of solutions to sdes with non - lipschitz drift has been studied by various authors .    for the case",
    "where @xmath6 is only bounded and measurable and @xmath7 is bounded , lipschitz , and satisfies a certain uniform ellipticity condition , @xcite and @xcite prove existence and uniqueness of a solution by locally removing the drift coefficient in a way such that locally the lipschitz condition of the diffusion coefficient is preserved .",
    "but uniform ellipticity is a strong assumption which is often violated in applications .    in @xcite an existence and uniqueness result for is presented for the case where the drift is potentially discontinuous at a hyperplane , or a special hypersurface , but well behaved everywhere else and where the diffusion coefficient is potentially degenerate . in that paper ,",
    "not the whole drift is removed , but only the discontinuity is removed locally from the drift .    due to the weaker requirements on the diffusion coefficient",
    "the restriction to homogeneous sdes does not pose any loss of generality . in @xcite",
    "the authors extend the result from @xcite to the time - inhomogenous case .    in @xcite an existence and uniqueness result , as well as a numerical method",
    "are presented for the one - dimensional case with piecewise lipschitz drift coefficient . there",
    "the coefficients are globally transformed into lipschitz ones .",
    "both computation of the transformed coefficients and inversion can be done efficiently .",
    "this leads to a numerical method for one - dimensional sdes through application of the euler - maruyama scheme on the transformed equation and transforming the approximation back .",
    "we give a simplified version of this result in section [ sec:1-dimensional ] .",
    "+ however , extending the result from @xcite to the @xmath0-dimensional case is not straightforward .",
    "one problem is that there is no immediate generalization of the concept of a piecewise lipschitz function with several variables that suites our needs .",
    "the second problem is that it is more difficult to obtain a transform that is a lipschitz diffeomorphism @xmath8 .",
    "we use hadamard s global inverse function theorem to prove that our transform is of this kind .",
    "moreover , we need to show that the transform and its inverse are sufficiently well - behaved for it s formula to hold .",
    "the coefficients of the sde obtained by transforming the original one are shown to be lipschitz , such that we can apply the euler - maruyama method to the transformed sde and obtain the ( best possible ) convergence order @xmath9 .",
    "an approximation to the original sde is then obtained by applying the inverse transform to the approximation of the transformed solution .",
    "one might ask whether the results of zvonkin and veretennikov give rise to a similar method . however , to apply their method one would have to solve a system of parabolic partial differential equations in each step .",
    "further , for using this solution in a numerical method like ours , one would also have to find its inverse function .",
    "therefore such a method , if it exists at all , would be rather costly from the computational perspective .",
    "+ in the present paper we present a transform for the multidimensional case which allows to prove an existence and uniqueness result for @xmath0-dimensional sdes with discontinuous drift and degenerate diffusion coefficient under conditions significantly weaker than those in the literature .",
    "the essential geometric condition in our setup is that the diffusion must have a component orthogonal to the set of discontinuities of the drift .",
    "furthermore , we present a numerical method for such sdes based on the ideas outlined above . up to the authors knowledge there is no other numerical method that can deal with such a general class of sdes and",
    "gives strong convergence .",
    "+ we are now going to review the literature on numerical methods for sdes with non - globally lipschitz drift coefficient . in @xcite strong convergence of the euler - maruyama scheme",
    "is proven under the assumption that the drift is of class @xmath10 . for",
    "an sde with continuously differentiable but non - globally lipschitz drift @xcite introduce a new explicit numerical scheme  the tamed euler scheme  and prove its strong convergence .",
    "@xcite proves strong convergence of the tamed euler scheme for sdes with one - sided lipschitz drift . for the euler - maruyama scheme",
    "@xcite proves almost sure convergence for the case that the drift satisfies a monotonicity condition .",
    "a different approach is introduced by @xcite , who show that the euler - maruyama scheme converges strongly for sdes with a discontinuous monotone drift coefficient , especially mentioning the case in which the drift is a heaviside function .",
    "@xcite show weak convergence of a method where they first regularize the drift and then apply the euler - maruyama scheme .",
    "they allow the drift to be discontinuous . @xcite",
    "introduce an exact simulation algorithm for sdes that have a bounded drift coefficient being discontinuous in one point , but differentiable everywhere else .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:1-dimensional ]",
    "we give the one - dimensional result and algorithm in a form that can be generalized to multiple dimensions , which subsequently is done in section [ sec : d - dimensional ] .    in section [ sec : example ] we give a numerical example for the purpose of illustration , where the drift coefficient has discontinuities along the unit circle in @xmath11 .",
