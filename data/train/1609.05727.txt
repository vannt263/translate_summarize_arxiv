    "the explanation of the origin of power  law or scale  invariant features associated with complex systems has been an active and fascinating area of research in statistical physics .",
    "this feature is well recognized in natural science as zipf s law @xcite that states how frequently a word occurs in a given typical text is inversely proportional to its rank such as @xmath6 with @xmath2 close to 1 .",
    "typical instances range from the size - distributions of cities @xcite , commercial firms @xcite , and fluctuations in financial markets @xcite , to diameters of moon craters @xcite ( see ref .  @xcite for more examples ) .",
    "however , in many situations the exponent is not exactly 1 but takes value in [ 0 , 1 ] .",
    "although frequency versus rank plots are not common in statistical physics , the frequency distribution has a decaying power law dependence , with the two exponents being related ; the exponent for frequency distribution @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recently , a state or sample space reducing ( ssr ) stochastic process @xcite has been proposed as a mechanism to explain scale  invariance , in particular , zipf s law .",
    "earlier proposed mechanisms @xcite include self - organized criticality @xcite , preferential attachment @xcite , a combination of exponentials @xcite , an inverse of quantities @xcite , and multiplicative process @xcite .",
    "ssr mainly reflects the process of ageing in complex systems , where the size of state space , namely the set of all possible allowed states , reduces as time advances .",
    "striking examples of an ssr include the process of sentence formation in linguistics @xcite , fragmentation of materials @xcite , polymerisation process @xcite , and diffusion on weighted , directed and acyclic graphs @xcite . the sample space may not be strictly reducing in some cases , but one can incorporate the occasional expansion as a fluctuation ; this is termed a noisy ssr process .    a mapping between seemingly different problems in statistical physics not only facilitates computation but can also provide deeper insight @xcite .",
    "interesting examples from this point of view include the mapping of percolation on trees to brownian excursions @xcite , or the directed abelian sandpile on a narrow strip to a random walk on a ring @xcite or the fragmentation and aggregation process in polymerization to the study of cycles in random permutation with uniform measure @xcite . in the present context , the mapping between survival time statistics for ssr processes and records statistics of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables @xcite is most pertinent .    in this work ,",
    "our focus is on the _ noisy _ ssr process .",
    "we first review the recent developments on the ssr process ; in previous work @xcite the statistics of survival times , defined as the life span of the ssr process was studied .",
    "exact results , supported by simulations , showed that both mean and variance of the survival time vary in a logarithmic manner as a function of system size , and the asymptotic probability distribution is gaussian . the correspondence noted here , between the survival time statistics for the ssr process and the records statistics of iid random variables not only provides a deeper insight about the system , but it also becomes apparent to identify other applications of the ssr process , for example , polymerization process @xcite to cycles statistics in random permutation @xcite .    we show here that the records statistics in a random time series , suitably modelled as a correlated random process ( such as random walk ) is potentially equivalent to noisy ssr process , and can be completely characterised by a parameter @xmath2 .",
    "studies of records statistics are relevant in many applications such as financial time series or price fluctuations of a commodity that are examples of correlated noisy signal .",
    "furthermore , the noisy process with @xmath8 is equivalent to the records statistics problem in standard brownian motion or in the standard random walk .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "the definition of the noisy ssr process with detailed numerical simulation results for the survival time statistics is presented in sec .",
    "ii . subsequently , analytical and numerical results for the records statistics in correlated random events are studied in sec .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in sec .",
    "iv which also includes a discussion .",
    "we begin with recalling the definition of ssr stochastic process @xcite .",
    "this can be visualised as a directed random hopping process on @xmath9 , the set of positive integers @xcite .",
    "the state of the process is , say , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , meaning the walker is at @xmath12th site after time @xmath13 .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the life span or survival time of the process is a discrete random variable such that @xmath16 .",
    "the dynamical rules are the following : if the walker is at site @xmath12 with @xmath17 after time @xmath13 , then at time @xmath18 it can go to any site in the interval @xmath19 $ ] with equal probability that is with @xmath20 . as a result of this jump ,",
    "if the outcome is @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , then the walker can similarly jump to any site in the interval @xmath23 $ ] with probability @xmath24 .",
    "the same process is repeated until the walker reaches to site 1 .",
    "clearly , the process is strictly reducing .",
    "since @xmath25 represents that there is only one state for the system under consideration , this would act as an absorbing state .",
    "one available state means the system s state does not change as a function of time , meaning no dynamics .",
    "further , consider an unconstrained random hopping that can be seen as random hopping on @xmath9 , without any restriction .",
    "denote the state of this process as @xmath26 with @xmath27 . here , the dynamics is such that walker can jump from site @xmath12 to any available site with uniform probability",
    ". then the noisy ssr process can be described as a superposition of ssr and unconstrained random hopping where the ssr process is executed with probability @xmath2 .",
    "the state of the noisy ssr process is evolved in time as x_(t ) = x(t ) + ( 1-)x_0(t ) , with @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "clearly , for @xmath29 the standard ssr process is recovered , while @xmath30 corresponds to unconstrained random hopping . in this case , the survival time is not necessarily be restricted by @xmath1 as in the case of the ssr process .",
    "since for the ssr process all possible configurations can be easily counted , the exact analytical results could be obtained for several observables such as survival time , occupation , and visiting probability distribution . for a single realization of the ssr process a site",
    "is visited once , thus the visiting probability distribution @xmath31 , i.e. , the probability with which a site is visited and the occupation probability @xmath32 that denotes on an average how many times a site is visited are related by a normalization factor as @xmath33 @xcite .    on the other hand , the case of noisy ssr process",
    "is such that the subjective approach for computing the probability distribution of an observable does not work .",
    "however , since the noisy ssr process is a markov process that is future state only depends on the present state not on the past states ( i.e. , memoryless process ) and the process is stationary as when @xmath34 , the process is restarted reflecting that the state is bound even in long time run , the master equation for occupation probability can be written exactly @xcite .",
    "thus on solving the master equation , the most striking feature observed for the process i.e. , the zipf s law can be deduced .",
    "this gives the average visitation frequency for a site , namely the occupation probability distribution as p(i ) ~i^- , with the exponent @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "we first present simulations using monte carlo method .",
    "numerical results , shown in figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] suggest that mean and variance of the survival time as a function of the system size , within statistical error , follow the simple scaling behaviour ~n^ , and _",
    "^2 ~n^2 , with @xmath5 .",
    "this relation will be derived below .",
    "one can also immediately note that the relative fluctuation @xmath36 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "further , the survival time distribution for the noisy ssr process exhibits a universal scaling behaviour independent of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , when plotted with scaled argument variable @xmath37 of a function @xmath38 [ see figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ] .",
    "this suggests that the survival time distribution can be expressed as _ n ( ) ~n^-j ( ) , where the universal scaling function has an exponentially decaying form such as j ( ) ~(- ) , where @xmath39 is a constant . clearly , @xmath40 for large @xmath41 .",
    "let us introduce an indicator variable @xmath42 such that it is on or 1 if the noisy ssr process visits @xmath43th site after time @xmath13 and off or 0 otherwise . with this indicator variable on an average how many times the walker visits @xmath43th site can be easily computed as @xmath44 = p(k)$ ] .",
    "as the total number of visits over the entire lattice before reaching at site 1 is the survival time , the mean survival time is @xmath45 .",
    "clearly , the mean survival time is proportional to the area under occupation distribution . for large @xmath1 treating the sum @xmath46 as integration",
    ", we have = _ 1^np(x)dx ~_1^n . in order to identify a relation between the exponents @xmath47 and @xmath2 , we proceed as : now , introduce scaled variable @xmath48 . then we see that ~n^1-_0+^1 ~n^ , suggesting = 1 -",
    ". we also note that _",
    "= 1^_n ( ) ~_k=1^np(k ) .",
    "[ mean_p ]    an integer selected randomly with a uniform measure in the interval @xmath49 $ ] has the average number of divisors that varies logarithmically as a function of @xmath1 . dividing a number is basically reducing its size .",
    "but , the behaviour of variance is not analytically known and numerical results suggest that this does not vary in a logarithmic manner as in the case that of the survival time for the ssr process @xcite .",
    "the crucial point here is that in order to ensure that there is an exact correspondence [ as discussed later ] , the complete statistics should behave similarly .",
    "for this reason , it becomes important to numerically check not only both the mean and variance but the entire distribution of the survival time in the noisy ssr process in its original version .",
    "consider a discrete time symmetric random walk with a constant drift term @xcite described as x(t+1 ) = x(t ) + c + ( t ) , [ eq1 ] where @xmath50 denotes the drift and @xmath51 is a random variable with cauchy distribution f ( ) =",
    ". set initial condition @xmath52 and the process is executed for time @xmath53 such that @xmath54 . in order to generate , the random variables with such distribution , first generate uniformly distributed random variables in the range @xmath55 $ ] , and then take the following nonlinear transformation @xmath56 .",
    "further , it can be noted that the dynamical equation for @xmath57 describes standard brownian motion ( sbm ) when the drift is zero , i.e. , @xmath58 and @xmath51 being gaussian distributed random variables .",
    "also , @xmath59 and variance is equal to @xmath60 if @xmath51 being iid random variable with normal distribution @xmath61 and if there is no restriction on time .",
    "clearly , this is non - stationary stochastic process .",
    "let us recall the definition of record event in a random time series of size @xmath1 .",
    "an event forms a record if it is largest or smallest of all previously existing entries [ see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ] . as it has been established that the total number of records follows a gaussian distribution with the mean number of records and variance both varying logarithmically if @xmath57 is iid random variables .",
    "if the event is modelled by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , it has been observed that the mean number of records grows algebraically @xcite as @xmath62 with ( c ) = + ( c ) , where @xmath63 $ ] that leads to @xmath64 $ ] . and",
    ", the variance is given as @xmath65 with the probability distribution satisfying a scaling behaviour @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the probability that a record would happen to occur at @xmath67th step is the rate at which event @xmath68 would be a record .",
    "imagine a random walker such that the walker jumps on the time axis where records have been formed .",
    "the rate with which record would form at time @xmath67 is equivalent to how frequently a noisy ssr process visits at site @xmath67 .",
    "the visiting probability distribution of the process is described as p(i ) ~i^-(c ) , with the exponent @xmath35 $ ] . since in this case",
    "each step may form a record once in a single realization , the visiting and occupation probabilities are directly related .",
    "the analysis [ from eq .",
    "( 6 ) to ( 9 ) ] done in the sec .",
    "ii shows that @xmath69 .",
    "numerical results shown in fig .  [ fig6 ] support this observation .",
    "it can be observed that the statistics of survival time in the noisy ssr process is equivalent to the statistics of the total number of records formed in time series of length @xmath1 modelled by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) that describe correlated random variables .",
    "let us recall the indicator variable @xmath70 such that it is on or 1 if @xmath71 forms a record that is it is better than all previous entries or @xmath72 otherwise . with this indicator variable total number of records can be easily computed as @xmath73 .",
    "further , the mean records is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .    when @xmath76 or @xmath50 is positive and large , each event is likely to surpass the previous event .",
    "consequently , the visiting probability would be uniform .",
    "on the other extreme , @xmath77 or @xmath50 is negative and small . for the @xmath43th site",
    ", the event would form a record with probability @xmath78 as each event would behave independently and occurring with equal probability . the chance for a site beyond the first site to form a record rapidly decreases as its distance increases from the first site , since this follows a power law behaviour in the visiting probability with exponent approximately equal to 1 .",
    "since @xmath79 is the initial condition , any positive event would form a record at the first step . for iid random variables ,",
    "the first event forms a record with unit probability , but for the correlated time series modelled as symmetric drifted random walk with zero drift can have either positive or negative value with equal probability .",
    "hence the first event forms a record with 1/2 probability .",
    "further , it is noted that in a random time series a record would form at a site or time once , but in noisy ssr process the same site may be visited many times .",
    "although there are several stochastic processes studied under the field records statistics , the case that we consider is the most useful as it is simple and able to explain the entire spectrum of exponents of zipf s law observed for noisy ssr process .",
    "we have studied the survival time statistics in noisy ssr process . based on numerical simulations",
    "we find that the mean and variance both satisfy a simple scaling behaviours as @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , the survival time probability distribution has the form @xmath3 , where the universal scaling function is exponentially decaying .",
    "these results enable us to identify a map between the survival time statistics in noisy ssr process and the records statistics in a symmetric random walk with a drift term and with the jumps following a cauchy distribution . established analytical results for records statistics",
    "thereby provide an enhanced understanding of the noisy ssr process .",
    "in addition , the records statistics in correlated random events explain the entire spectrum of exponents of the zipf s law .    as noted that the ssr process has correspondence with records statistics in iid random variables and the records statistics in this case can be mapped with statistics of cycles in random permutation with uniform measure @xcite .",
    "polymerization that consists of fragmentation and aggregation processes can be mapped to the formation of cycles in random permutation with uniform measure @xcite .",
    "it is suggestive , using transitivity , that the ssr process can apply to such situations as well .",
