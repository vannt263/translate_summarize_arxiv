    "the hamiltonian of the degenerate blume - emery - griffiths ( dbeg ) model reads : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the exchange constant , @xmath5 is the biquadratic interaction , @xmath6 is a crystal field , the first two sums are over nearest - neighbor pairs on a lattice , the third sum is over all sites , @xmath7 , and the @xmath0 states have a degeneracy @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this parameter mimics the effects of vibrational degrees of freedom on martensitic transitions .",
    "the dbeg model was studied , for a particular value of the crystal - field , within a mean - field approximation and monte carlo simulation : the effect of @xmath1 is to shrink the ferromagnetic phase and to increase the region where the transition is of first - order @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some materials were found to be better described by a disordered dbeg model , which may be relevant in the description of conventional shape memory alloys as well @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , on the other hand , it has been shown that randomness may have drastic consequences on multicritical behavior . in two dimensions , for instance ,",
    "any infinitesimal amount of disorder supresses non - symmetry - breaking first - order phase transitions and replaces symmetry - breaking first - order phase transitions by continuous ones .",
    "the effect of disorder on high - dimensional systems is different : first - order phase transitions disappear only at a finite amount of randomness @xcite .",
    "this behavior has been observed in a large variety of models , either with random `` field '' or with random `` interaction '' @xcite .",
    "thus , in the disordered dbeg model two ingredients have opposite effects : while the degeneracy factor @xmath1 increases the region where the transition is of first - order , disorder tends to supress this region .",
    "this competition may have interesting effects on the phase diagrams , apart from potential experimental relevance . in order to study this competition on high - dimensional systems ,",
    "we apply a mean - field approximation to the dbeg model in a random crystal - field , which follows the probability distribution @xmath8 .",
    "it is worthy stressing that , if the interaction parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , were chosen to be random , instead of the crystal field , the overall consequences on the phase diagram would be the same @xcite .",
    "our approximation is based on the gibbs inequality for the free energy @xcite : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the exact free energy , @xmath11 is the dbeg hamiltonian and @xmath12 is an exactly solvable density matrix .",
    "we chose @xmath12 as the most general single - site density matrix for the ferromagnetic ( positive @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) system .",
    "since this procedure is usual , we will not discuss it in detail .",
    "let us first comment on some general results we obtain , for any @xmath13 .",
    "the transition at zero temperature is not affected by the parameter @xmath1 and takes place at @xmath14 ; for smaller values of @xmath15 the magnetization equals 1 , while @xmath16 for @xmath17 .    for @xmath18 ,",
    "the random field dbeg model , with the field distribution given by the equation in the previous page , is equivalent to the quenched site - diluted spin-1/2 ising model .",
    "the states @xmath19 represent magnetic sites and the states @xmath0 represent non - magnetic impurities .",
    "therefore , only for @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the lattice - dependent value of @xmath22 where an infinite cluster of present sites is formed for the first time , when @xmath22 is increased from zero ) the critical line between @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( see figures ) should extend to @xmath25 . for @xmath26 , the `` tail '' of continuous transition would touch the zero temperature axis at a finite value of @xmath15 .",
    "the reason we find this `` tail '' extending to @xmath25 for any @xmath27 is that the present approximation is equivalent to a model with infinite - range interactions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the assymptotic value of @xmath28 for @xmath29 equals @xmath22 .",
    "this result comes from the mapping cited in the last paragraph : the degeneracy of the @xmath0 states and the biquadratic interaction @xmath5 play no role in the dynamics of the @xmath19 states .",
    "if the distribution @xmath30 is used , a different result will hold .",
    "the limit @xmath29 is now equivalent to the _",
    "spin-1 _ site - diluted ising model ; therefore , @xmath5 and @xmath1 are relevant and the assymptotic value of @xmath28 depends on both parameters .    since for high values of @xmath13",
    "the critical behavior does not depend strongly on @xmath1 , we well depict only the phase diagrams for @xmath31 , where qualitative changes occur when @xmath1 is varied .    in figs . 1 and 2 we show the @xmath32 phase diagrams for @xmath31 and for some values of @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath33 , the reentrant behavior observed for @xmath2 is lost and a tricritical point is introduced for @xmath34 .",
    "this latter curve is qualitatively equivalent to the phase diagram for @xmath22 close to zero . for @xmath35 a reentrant behavior",
    "is obtained for high enough @xmath1 ( curve(c ) ) ; a critical end point ( e ) , which was not present for @xmath2 and @xmath34 , is also observed .",
    "the first order transition curve for @xmath36 extends to negative values of @xmath15 , until it reaches a line of continuous transitions at a tricritical point ( not depicted in the fig .",
    "using a mean - field approximation , we calculate the phase diagrams for the random crystal field dbeg model , varying the degree of disorder , @xmath22 , and the degeneracy factor @xmath1 . for high values of @xmath13",
    "the phase diagrams are almost insensitive to the value of @xmath1 , while for @xmath31 the dependence on @xmath1 is stronger .",
    "for the latter value of @xmath13 and @xmath35 the phase diagram changes qualitatively when @xmath1 is increased enough : while for @xmath2 , for instance , the order - disorder transition is always continuous and the first - order transition inside the ordered phase ends in a critical point , for @xmath36 a line of first order transition separates the ordered and disordered phases at low values of @xmath15 .",
    "a reentrant behavior is obtained for high @xmath1 . for @xmath37 and @xmath33 ,",
    "the degeneracy reintroduces a tricritical point and eliminates the reentrant behavior",
    ".    some of the features found in this work may be artifact of the simple mean - field approximation we used and should not hold for a low - dimensional system .",
    "preliminary results for the square lattice , using a real - space renormalization - group approach , show a different behavior : for any infinitesimal amount of disorder the first order transition is supressed , independent of @xmath1 .",
