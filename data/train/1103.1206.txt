    "it is well - known that particles containing an even number of fermions behave like bosons under certain experimental conditions .",
    "this fact has been confirmed in numerous experiments where bose - einstein condensates of atoms have been created .",
    "this is generally believed to occur at low densities , where the overlap of the fermionic wave functions can be neglected . in @xcite , it was hypothesised that the amount of entanglement between the constituent fermions plays a role in the boson - like behaviour . in this paper",
    "we scrutinize this idea further and show that a large amount of entanglement is not sufficient .",
    "we refine it and identify more precisely the role entanglement plays in boson - like behaviour of bipartite systems of two species of distinguishable fermions .",
    "we focus on the simplest scenario of a composite boson ( coboson ) made of two constituent distinguishable fermions .",
    "an example of such a system is an exciton made of an electron - hole pair in semiconductors .",
    "the bosonic behavior of excitons , especially in the context of bose - einstein condensation has been studied ( see for example @xcite ) , and it is commonly accepted that excitons behave like bosons when the density is low such that the pauli exclusion principle and the coulomb interaction can be neglected .    in general , the state of a single composite boson made of two distinguishable fermions of type a and b can be written as @xmath0 creates particle a ( b ) in mode @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is the probability of occupation of mode n. the sum in the above equation is over all modes from 0 to @xmath3 , however for ease of calculation , we can introduce a cutoff @xmath4 ( justified on grounds of finite energy ) , which later will be taken to infinity .",
    "standard anti - commutation rules apply , i.e. , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and creation / anihilation operators for fermions of type a and b anti - commute .",
    "the number of non - zero coefficients @xmath2 is the schmidt number of this state and as long as it is larger than one the state is entangled .",
    "the amount of entanglement between fermions a and b can be quantified for instance by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix of one of the subsystems , which is simply the shannon entropy of the probability distribution generated by @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "a necessary condition for the composite system described by the state @xmath9 to exhibit boson - like behaviour is that the creation operator of the coboson @xmath10 mimics a proper bosonic creation operator as faithfully as possible .",
    "the corresponding commutation relation is given by @xmath11= \\textbf{1 } - \\sum_n \\lambda_n ( a^{\\dagger}_n a_n +   b^{\\dagger}_n b_n ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] the operator @xmath12 can be interpreted as a deviation from the proper bosonic commutation relations and it should be as small as possible in some sense .",
    "an interesting method of quantifying the smallness of @xmath13 was investigated in @xcite .",
    "two operators were considered , the bosonic departure @xmath14 $ ] and the boson number @xmath15 , whose expectation value in the cobosonic number states @xmath16 were postulated to be a measure of the _ quality _ of bosons .",
    "the state @xmath16 is defined as follows @xmath17 , which is given by @xmath18 the behaviour of the state @xmath16 under the action of the corresponding annihilation operator @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 the parameter @xmath21 is a normalization constant and @xmath22 is a vector orthogonal to @xmath23 of norm @xmath24    the expectation values of the bosonic departure and boson number operators in @xmath16 are @xmath25 \\right\\rangle_{n } = 2\\left(1-\\frac{\\chi_{n+1}}{\\chi_{n}}\\right ) \\nonumber\\ ] ] and @xmath26 \\right\\rangle_{n } \\nonumber\\ ] ] as can be seen from the above equations , the ratio @xmath27 is a mathematical indicator of the quality of the boson . in particular , bosonic behavior is obtained when the ratio approaches one .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that @xmath28 and @xmath29 as @xmath30 .    in @xcite , it was shown that for a particular ( exponential ) distribution of @xmath31 , the above ratio is in fact related to the entanglement between the constituent fermions and approaches one in the limit of infinite entanglement . moreover , since in principle entanglement does not depend on the distance between the fermions , it was speculated that highly delocalized cobosons could be prepared and made to condense .",
    "this result was extended in @xcite , where it was shown that the ratio @xmath32 can be bounded from below and from above by simple functions of the purity @xmath33 of the reduced density matrix @xmath34 of particle a ( b ) , which is an entanglement measure for pure states of the bipartition a - b .",
    "the result was @xmath35 for highly entangled states , i.e. , for which @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the above bounds were proposed to validate the hypothesis that the cobosonic behavior depends on the entanglement between a and b.    before proceeding with the main argument , let us show that one can obtain better approximations to the ratio @xmath38 by making use of the newton - girard identities that relate elementary symmetric polynomials @xmath39 to the complete symmetric polynomials @xmath40 .",
    "this relation is given by @xmath41 note that @xmath42 is the purity defined earlier .",
    "dividing the above equation throughout by @xmath43 and noting that for large n , @xmath44 , we obtain @xmath45    a necessary condition for good bosonic behaviour is that for all k , @xmath46 , which implies that the terms @xmath47 in the expression above decrease in magnitude sharply @xcite . for instance , for a typical @xmath31 of the order of @xmath48 , the expression @xmath49 is of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "hence , performing a series expansion around these small terms leads to @xmath51 better approximations to this important ratio for large n can be made by considering more terms in the series expansion above .",
    "however , we shall see that high entanglement between pairs of fermions is not sufficient to make them behave like bosons .",
    "in general , the flagship bosonic phenomena like bunching and bose - einstein condensation do not depend on the interaction between bosons . therefore we consider a model in which there is no interaction between fermions a and b because these processes should be possible even in the absence of such interaction . in quantum information theory",
    "such processes are referred to as locc ( local operations and classical communication ) ones . in our case",
    ", this would imply local operations among fermions of type a and b only ( see figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "a notable characteristic of these is that entanglement can not be increased , which would require interaction between subsystems .",
    "the necessary and sufficient criterion for determinisitc locc transformation between bipartite quantum states was given in @xcite where the mathematical concept of majorization was introduced into quantum information theory .",
    "since we want the cobosons to behave like real bosons , the deterministic locc process of formation of @xmath52-particle cobosonic states @xmath16 must be possible . as a result",
    ", the corresponding final and initial cobosonic states have to obey the majorization criterion .",
    "we show that @xmath36 does not imply majorization , by providing a counterexample .",
    "finally , we find a sufficient condition for bosonic behavior incorporating majorization and high entanglement .",
    "in this section we refer to the process of generating the state @xmath16 from @xmath52 single - particle cobosonic states @xmath53 as a process of creating a condensate .",
    "it should be noted that this is a simplified notion of the actual picture , since we do not consider parameters such as temperature .",
    "however , this simplification captures the essential feature of the condensation process with regard to the macroscopic occupation of a single state .",
    "let us start with @xmath52 identical cobosons in @xmath52 different potential wells as illustrated in figure [ f1 ] .     give rise to the internal structure of cobosons @xmath54 .",
    "we are looking for the possibility of existence of an locc operation bringing all cobosons into one well . ]",
    "the initial state is thus given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 creates one coboson in the jth well .",
    "our goal is to condense all cobosons in a single well , i.e. , to obtain the final state @xmath57 ( up to normalization ) . since we do not allow parts a and b to interact ( locc ) , the process of condensation can not increase the entanglement between a and b. the allowed set of deterministic locc transformations on bipartite entangled states is given by the majorization criterion @xcite , which states that a state @xmath9 can be transformed by locc into another state @xmath58 iff the vector of eigenvalues of the density matrix of one of the two subsystems of state @xmath9 , denoted by @xmath59 , is majorized by the corresponding vector @xmath60 of state @xmath58 .",
    "we write @xmath61 , which means that for all @xmath62 @xmath63 , with equality @xmath64 , where @xmath65 symbol indicates that the eigenvalues are enumerated in decreasing order , i.e. , @xmath66 . in order to verify that majorization applies to fermionic systems ,",
    "let us emphasize that all the necessary transformations can be performed while the cobosons occupy different wells .",
    "hence , there exists a parameter which allows us to distinguish between different cobosons , and then to perform one - to - one mapping from @xmath52 wells into one .",
    "the majorization criterion has to be applied to the vectors of eigenvalues of the initial and final reduced density matrices of subsystem a or b ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) , which in our case are given by the diagonal matrices @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a normalization factor which is related to @xmath39 via @xmath72 . in the second equation we skipped the superscript @xmath73 , since all operators correspond to cobosons in one well . in this sense , condensation is a process in which the cobosons lose their identity and become indistinguishable once all of them are in the same well . since the @xmath74 s",
    "are enumerated decreasingly , the ordered vectors of eigenvalues for the initial ( @xmath75 ) and final ( @xmath76 ) states are @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "note , that in this case the vector @xmath79 is @xmath80-dimensional and @xmath81 is @xmath82-dimensional .",
    "the dimension of the second vector being smaller than that of the first , we augment @xmath81 by @xmath83 zeros . in the following sections",
    ", we shall look for cobosonic states described by distributions @xmath84 for which @xmath85 .",
    "we show that small purity @xmath86 does not imply majorization .",
    "we find cobosonic states for which the purity is small but vectors @xmath79 and @xmath81 corresponding to @xmath53 and @xmath16 , respectively , do not obey the majorization criterion . for simplicity , we consider the violation of the majorization relation between the first elements of these vectors @xmath87 noting that @xmath88 are arranged in descending order , we can write @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . therefore , eq . ( [ majbreak ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath93 . using ( [ wt ] ) , one finds that @xmath94 applying the above relation @xmath52 times we obtain @xmath95 therefore majorization fails if @xmath96    next , let us consider cobosonic states with @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the riemann zeta function . for @xmath99",
    "the sum of the @xmath100-series is one , thus it is a valid probability distribution .",
    "the purity for these states is given by @xmath101 it is small for @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) , since one can approximate ( [ purity ] ) by @xmath104 moreover , in this case @xmath105 .",
    "plugging this into ( [ cond ] ) gives @xmath106^{n-1}>1 .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] for @xmath107 , we can expand the above into power series and keep only the terms up to the first order in @xmath108 @xmath109 it is clear that the majorization condition is violated .",
    "let us also point out that despite the fact that condensation is not possible by locc , the ratio @xmath110 can be close to one .",
    "taking into account the lower bound in ( [ wt ] ) , we have @xmath111 the right hand side is close to one for @xmath112 .",
    "this shows that majorization is a qualitatively different condition for bosonic behavior than previously studied .",
    "in the references @xcite , it was argued that a necessary condition for bosonic behavior of cobosons ( in particular , of excitons ) is @xmath113 this condition is related to the fact that the density of cobosons has to be low in order to prevent overlap between wavefunctions of underlying fermions .",
    "we now show that this condition is more general in that it implies @xmath114 , but not vice versa .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the purity is bounded from above by the largest coefficient @xmath115 . since @xmath116 ,",
    "we have @xmath117 and the following holds @xmath118 therefore @xmath119 is guaranteed if @xmath120 .    however , the converse is not true ( @xmath121 does not imply @xmath122 ) . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the states ( [ riemann ] ) for @xmath102 .",
    "for @xmath123 the purity is @xmath48 , but the condition ( [ dens ] ) is not satisfied , because @xmath124 and @xmath125 .    in general , it is hard to give a necessary and sufficient condition for the majorization of the initial schimidt vector of n cobosons @xmath75 by the final schmidt vector of the n coboson condensate @xmath76 .",
    "however , we would like to give a sufficient condition for majorization that has a simple physical interpretation . to do so , let us begin by considering the situation when @xmath4 and @xmath52 are finite , and then take the limit @xmath126 and @xmath127 while keeping the ratio @xmath128 constant .",
    "@xmath129 is a quantity proportional to the density of cobosons @xmath130 since @xmath129 = @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the density of states .",
    "let the state of our cobosons be described by the vector @xmath133 .",
    "firstly , let us note that if it were possible , by locc , to transform @xmath75 to a vector @xmath134 it would be possible to transform by locc @xmath75 to @xmath76 since the vector @xmath135 corresponds to the uniform distribution in the final hilbert space and hence is guaranteed to be majorized by @xmath76 .",
    "note that the distribution @xmath135 corresponds to the state with the highest @xmath136 and is therefore , the most ideal cobosonic condensate .",
    "the majorization problem @xmath137 yields a simple condition @xmath138 which in the infinite limit translates simply to @xmath139 the above condition , in the spirit of @xcite , provides a sufficient condition for the bosonic behavior of these particles , to wit that the probability of occupation of the ground state be less than the occupational density .",
    "it also supports the idea of a critical density for condensation , that is , the equation above may be satisfied for all densities above a critical value @xmath140 , ensuring that such distributions lead to a condensation without interaction between the fermions as required for proper bosonic behavior .",
    "now , we show that there exist certain classes of states that always obey the majorization condition .",
    "let us consider states @xmath141 which were introduced in @xcite .",
    "for these , @xmath142 and the purity is given by @xmath143 for @xmath144 the purity is small . below we show that these states obey the majorization criterion for all z and n.    firstly , observe that @xmath145 where the degeneracy of @xmath146 is @xmath147 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath148 for which the degeneracy of @xmath146 ( @xmath149 ) is smaller than @xmath150 .",
    "the majorization states that , for all @xmath151 , the sum of the first @xmath151 terms of @xmath79 has to be less than , or equal to the sum of the first @xmath151 terms of @xmath81 .",
    "canceling common factors , the overall multiplicative factor in @xmath81 is @xmath152 and we can rewrite @xmath153 and @xmath154 next , notice that the sum over all terms of both vectors is the same and equal to @xmath155 .",
    "moreover , this sum can be written as a unique polynomial @xmath156 the sum of first @xmath151 terms of @xmath157 is given by @xmath158_j= \\sum_{j=0}^{l-1 } g_{j}^{(i ) } z^{j } + ( k - \\sum_{j=0}^{l-1 } g_{j}^{(i ) } ) z^{l}.\\nonumber\\ ] ] due to the multiplicative factor of @xmath159 and the fact that the degeneracy of @xmath159 is less than that of @xmath157 , we have @xmath158_j < \\sum_{j=1}^{k}[\\vec{\\lambda}_f']_j \\nonumber\\ ] ] which ends the proof .",
    "we have shown that the states in ( [ laws ] ) obey the majorization criterion for any @xmath160 and @xmath52 . as a consequence",
    ", the corresponding cobosons should indeed behave like ideal bosons for large @xmath160 ( when @xmath86 is small ) .",
    "we now note that there may exist certain classes of states which do not describe proper cobosons , in the sense that they do not obey the majorization relation",
    ". however , there exists the interesting possibility that some of these states are transformable by locc into states which obey majorization ( such as in ( [ laws ] ) for large z ) and therefore can be converted into proper cobosonic states .",
    "this means that they can be converted into condensates of different coboson type , i.e. , @xmath161    a sufficient criterion for majorization @xcite can be stated as : if there exists an @xmath162 @xmath163 such that for all @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and for @xmath166 , @xmath167 , then @xmath168 .",
    "this implies that any distribution of @xmath169 with @xmath170 ( with @xmath144 ) and with only one intersection with the exponential distribution in ( [ laws ] ) will be majorized by the latter , and can be considered as a good cobosonic distribution .",
    "in this article , we have studied the conjecture made in @xcite that the amount of entanglement between the constituent fermions of a composite boson is related to its bosonic properties .",
    "we note that while necessary , entanglement may not be sufficient to ensure ideal bosonic behavior of these states .",
    "our studies were made in relation to the majorization condition in the context of creating a cobosonic number state @xmath16 from @xmath52 single particle states @xmath53 .",
    "we provide a counter - example in terms of the riemann distribution which shows that the property of small purity does not necessarily lead to majorization .",
    "we also note that a more fundamental condition is that given in terms of small density , to wit , @xmath171 which leads to small purity , but not vice versa .",
    "also , we introduced a sufficient condition for majorization which lends support to the idea of a critical density for condensation .",
    "we note that certain states such as those in @xcite always obey majorization .",
    "this leads to the interesting possibility that there may exist certain states , which while not obeying majorization themselves , might be transformable by locc to states that do .",
    "lack of majorization implies the necessity of interaction for the process of condensation to occur .",
    "for instance , an interesting future problem would be to study the excitonic states in @xcite in the context of majorization , to check if excitonic condensates can be prepared in the absence of interaction between electrons and holes .    _",
