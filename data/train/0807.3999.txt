    "recently , graphite - based one - dimensional materials with nano - meter sizes have been attracting much attention in both the fundamental and applied sciences . a nano - graphite ribbon ( ngr )",
    "is a nano - meter size graphite fragment and is known to have a band structure strongly depending on the shape of edges@xcite .",
    "the ngr with zigzag shaped edges , which is schematically shown in figure 1 and called as a zigzag ngr in the following , has a metallic band structure independent of the number of the legs @xmath2 .",
    "the energy dispersion is , however , quite different from that of the regular square lattice , especially near the fermi energy .",
    "the asymptotic behavior near the fermi energy is given as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hopping energy between the nearest neighbor atoms and @xmath8 is the lattice spacing , and then the fermi velocity vanishes .",
    "such a singular band structure is a manifestation of the fact that the states close to the fermi energy are localized near the zigzag edges .    in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the properties of the materials with such a remarkable band structure through the persistent current in the isolated ring pierced by the magnetic flux shown in figure 2 and the conductance of the system attached with the perfect leads made from the regular square lattices ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "we take care of dependences on the sample length @xmath0 and on the number of the legs @xmath2 .",
    "there exist already studies on the persistent current@xcite and the transport properties@xcite of the zigzag ngr .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , however , the sample size dependences have not been discussed for the former , and the system with the present setup has not been investigated for the latter .",
    "anomalous @xmath0 dependences are found in both quantities .",
    "more interestingly , the @xmath0 dependences of the even @xmath2 cases and those of the odd @xmath2 cases are qualitatively different from each other even in the absence of the mutual interaction .     odd .",
    "the closed ( open ) circles show the a ( b ) sublattice and the rectangle with the dash - dotted line indicates a unit cell . here",
    "@xmath8 denotes the lattice spacing.,width=226 ]",
    "we consider the zigzag ngr consisting of @xmath2 zigzag legs and the length @xmath9 .",
    "the spin degree of freedom is omitted because the quantities we consider are independent of the spin index and taking account of it makes these quantities twice larger .",
    "we utilize the tight - binding model with the hopping between the nearest neighbor atoms , @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the pair of the nearest neighbor atoms and @xmath12 is the creation operator of the electron at the atom @xmath13 . in the following ,",
    "the persistent currents and the conductances are discussed based on eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) in the absence of doping , in which case the fermi level is located at the top of the valence band and at the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "the persistent current flows in the isolated rings or cylinders made from a normal metal threaded by the magnetic flux @xmath14 without decaying .",
    "it is a periodic function of @xmath14 with the period @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) being the planck constant and the electronic charge , respectively .",
    "the current at the absolute zero temperature is obtained as follows , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy dispersion with the subband @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 being an integer .",
    "the summations in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath24 are performed for @xmath25 because of the particle - hole symmetry of the band structure .    in the clean strict one - dimensional systems@xcite",
    ", the persistent current behaves like a saw as a function of the magnetic flux and it s amplitude is given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the fermi velocity . in the case with finite width@xcite ,",
    "the current also shows a saw like dependences and the maximum of the amplitude decays as @xmath28 irrespective of the number of the legs . for the zigzag ngr , the persistent current can flow in spite of the vanishing fermi velocity@xcite .",
    "different from the square lattices , however , the current shows smooth sinusoidal dependence as a function of the flux as is shown in figure 4 ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we show the amplitude of the currents as a function of @xmath29 for @xmath30 odd ( c ) and for @xmath30 even ( d ) in figure 4 .",
    "obviously , the odd and even legs cases are different from each other in the @xmath0 dependence . for @xmath31 , the amplitude of",
    "the former decays as @xmath32 , whereas the maximum values of the amplitudes for the latter show the exponential dependence .",
    "note that we can derive the analytical expression of the amplitude for @xmath33 as @xmath34 \\right\\}$ ] for @xmath31 , which reproduces the numerical result .     as a function of the flux for @xmath35 ( a ) and @xmath36 ( b ) .",
    "the amplitude as a function of @xmath29 for @xmath30 odd and @xmath30 even are shown in ( c ) and",
    "( d ) , respectively .",

    "( [ eqn : pc ] ) . in this criterion ,",
    "the zigzag ngr without doping is classified into an insulator due to the vanishing fermi velocity in spite of the absence of the gap at the fermi energy .",
    "such an anomalous nature , therefore , is expected to lead interesting transport properties .",
    "we investigate the conductance of the system in figure 3 , where the zigzag ngr is connected to the perfect leads made from square lattices , by utilizing the recursive green function method@xcite .",
    "we note that the hopping between the nearest neighbor site in the perfect leads is assumed to be the same as that of the sample region for simplicity .",
    "the conductance @xmath40 normalized by @xmath3 as a function of the sample length @xmath29 is shown in figure [ fig : g ] for @xmath30 odd ( a ) and for @xmath30 even ( b ) .",

    "as easily seen , the asymptotic behavior with @xmath31 for @xmath30 odd is qualitatively different from that for @xmath30 even . in the @xmath30 odd cases",
    ", the conductance @xmath40 tends to unity . on the other hand ,",
    "the conductance for @xmath41 even is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "note that we can successfully obtain the analytical asymptotic ( @xmath31 ) expression for @xmath33 as @xmath43 , identical with the numerical result .",
    "we theoretically investigated the properties of the nano - graphite ribbons with zigzag shaped edges without doping through the persistent current in the isolated ring and the conductance of the system connected to the perfect leads .",
    "both quantities are found to show the remarkable sample length @xmath0 dependence , which in the materials with even legs and with odd legs are different from each other .",
    "it seems to be very strange that qualitative differences between the @xmath30 odd and even cases appear because we can not find clear qualitative discrepancy in the band structure .",
    "the results for @xmath30 odd seem to indicate that only the band touching the fermi energy with the asymptotic dispersion proportional to @xmath44 contributes to the both quantities as a whole . on the other hand",
    ", we suppose that strong suppressions of these quantities in @xmath30 even compared with @xmath30 odd originate from subtle cancellation . in ref .",
    "6 , akhmerov et al . investigated the transport properties of the zigzag ngr under the potential step and found the similar discrepancy in the conductance between the even and odd legs cases .",
    "their model is different from ours in the origin of scattering . in the former",
    "the origin is the potential step , whereas the mismatch between the square lattice and the honeycomb lattice gives rise to the scattering in the latter .",
    "further investigation is necessary for clarifying the mechanism leading to such strange @xmath0 dependences and those differences between even and odd legs cases .",
