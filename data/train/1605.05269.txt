    "the design of cdma systems requires many codewords , both to allow a sufficient number of users in each cell , and to avoid interference arising from the re - use of a codeword in a close cell .",
    "a usual way of constructing spreading codes in these systems is to employ correlation - constrained sets of hadamard matrices @xcite ensuring that the cross - correlation of the rows of different matrices lies in the range @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "a hadamard matrix , denoted by @xmath5 , is an @xmath6 matrix with elements in @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the @xmath6 identity matrix . given a set of such matrices @xmath10 , then denoting by @xmath11 the @xmath12th row of @xmath13 the set @xmath10 is called correlation - constrained if the inner product @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) lies in the range @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "a particular choice of these matrices was considered in @xcite and it was ensured that for @xmath17 the value of @xmath18 lies in the range @xmath4 $ ] .    it should be mentioned that apart from synchronous cdma ( s - cdma ) systems treated in this paper , there is an alternative approach known as qs - cdma which stands for quasi - synchronous cdma systems @xcite . for these systems",
    "it is of importance that the inner product of two sequences has zero cross - correlation even though one of the sequences is cyclically shifted within a certain range ( known as a zero correlation zone ) .",
    "more precisely , for two binary sequences @xmath19 and @xmath20 of length @xmath21 , the sum @xmath22 should equal to zero for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a positive integer @xcite .",
    "loosely synchronized ( ls ) codes used for qs - cdma are constructed using hadamard matrices .",
    "these hadamard matrices can be replaced by the correlation - constrained sets constructed here with the same benefits as for s - cdma .",
    "our major goal in this work is to identify construction methods that generate a large set of orthogonal sequences ( useful in s - cdma systems ) and to efficiently solve the problem of assigning these sequences to a regular tessellation of hexagonal cells in such a way that the correlation between codewords assigned to adjacent cells is zero , while the correlation between codewords assigned to non - adjacent cells is small .",
    "the so - called re - use distance @xmath25 reflects the ability to use the same codewords in non - adjacent cells that are at distance @xmath25 from the cell where these codewords have originally been placed .",
    "this problem was addressed in @xcite , where the authors employed four cosets of a certain subcode of the first order reed - muller code in order to construct 12 sets of orthogonal sequences based on hadamard matrices and semi - bent functions .",
    "in addition , a suitable assignment of these sets into octants or quadrants ( see @xcite for definitions ) with @xmath2 was specified , and furthermore it was ensured that the inner product of the sequences in the same cell or in adjacent cells is zero .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the inner product of the sequences in non - adjacent cells is at most @xmath26 , and the total number of sequences assigned was @xmath27 , see @xcite .",
    "this approach yielded a significant improvement over other methods due to the specific properties of the hadamard matrices specified in @xcite .    in this paper , we employ plateaued sequences ( whose corresponding walsh spectra are three - valued ) derived from the maiorana - mcfarland class of boolean functions .",
    "these sequences also serve the purpose of constructing large sets of orthogonal sequences which may be efficiently assigned to a regular tessellation of hexagonal cells .",
    "we emphasize that we only consider the assignment to a regular hexagonal structure whereas the assignment to irregular networks can be done using heuristic algorithms developed in @xcite .",
    "even though we generally consider plateaued sequences , we essentially use semi - bent sequences whose maximum correlation is @xmath26 due to the requirement that the correlation of non - orthogonal sequences should be as small as possible .    our basic design approach , based on the use of vectorial semi - bent functions , generates a large family of sets of mutually orthogonal sequences ( within each set ) and is also characterized by the property that a great majority of these sets are also mutually orthogonal .",
    "to avoid a hard combinatorial problem of assigning several such orthogonal sets to a single cell , while preserving the orthogonality to adjacent cells , this method is combined with the so - called bent concatenation used for extending the length of these codewords to the desired length .",
    "this allows us to increase the number of orthogonal sequences per cell without modifying the original assignment found for small suitably chosen @xmath0 . nevertheless , to achieve an optimal assignment of orthogonal sets when @xmath0 is even ( in terms of the number of users per cell )",
    "we employ a slightly modified basic approach which ensures that the number of sequences per cell is @xmath3 in this case as well . to summarize , compared to the methods in @xcite which for @xmath28 give @xmath29 orthogonal sequences per cell for all @xmath0 ( apart from the cases @xmath30 when their number is @xmath3 @xcite )",
    ", our approach can be used for assigning @xmath3 orthogonal sequences per cell for any @xmath31 .",
    "the methods described here may also be used for allocating @xmath29 orthogonal sequences per cell for @xmath32 and almost all @xmath0 .    finally , the possibility of using our families of orthogonal sets within the framework of orthogonal variable spreading factor ( ovsf ) codes is also addressed .",
    "these codes support variable data rates by shortening the length @xmath1 of the original sequences by some variable factor @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 ) , while the orthogonality and low correlation value ( when mutually non - orthogonal ) of these subsequences is preserved .",
    "it turns out that our first modification of the basic method , referred to as construction  [ constr:2 ] in this paper , ensures that ( only ) a certain shortening of the codewords satisfies the main characterization of ovsf codes .",
    "this eventually leads to an interesting open problem of constructing vectorial bent functions whose restrictions are semi - bent which would essentially give us the possibility to construct ovsf codes whose data rate can be varied within a wider range .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . some basic notions and concepts related to sequences",
    "are introduced in section  [ sec : prel ] . in section",
    "[ sec : main ] , a design of semi - bent vectorial boolean functions , upon which a large set of orthogonal semi - bent sequences is derived , is presented .",
    "two modifications of our main method , that allow us to fully specify the assignment of the orthogonal sets of sequences within a regular hexagonal tessellation of cells for ( almost ) any @xmath0 , are discussed in section  [ sec : modif ] . a comparison of our methods to the approach in @xcite , in terms of the number of sequences per cell , is also given here . in section  [ sec : qos ] , we discuss the possibility of using our construction techniques for the purpose of generating ovsf codes and quasi - orthogonal sequences .",
