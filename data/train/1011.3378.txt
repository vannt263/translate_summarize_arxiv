    "in recent years , considerable theoretical and experimental work is aimed at the controlled manipulation of electron spins in nanoscale solid state devices  @xcite .",
    "this research is motivated by actual applications , such as in digital information storage and read - out  @xcite , but also by the possibility of using the spin of electrons as computational units ( qubits ) in a quantum computer  @xcite .",
    "one of the mechanisms influencing the electron spin dynamics in these nano - devices is the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spins of the device s constituent material . for spin qubits",
    "hosted in semiconductor quantum dots  @xcite , hyperfine interaction has been identified as the main source of decoherence , causing the spin coherence time to be in the ns range  @xcite .",
    "much recent experimental and theoretical work is aimed at suppressing this hyperfine induced decoherence  @xcite . in other semiconductor nano - structures  @xcite  possibly also metallic structures  @xcite  hyperfine interaction can even dominate the electronic transport properties and spin dynamics .",
    "understanding the role of hyperfine interaction in spintronic devices therefore is crucial in the development of the field .",
    "traditionally , the interplay between electronic and nuclear spins is treated in the convenient framework of rate equations  @xcite .",
    "the rates of hyperfine transitions flipping nuclear spins ` up ' and ` down ' are separately calculated using fermi s golden rule , and the balancing of these rate yields the net nuclear spin pumping in the system .",
    "although this approach works very well in many cases  @xcite , it can become cumbersome when the electron spin dynamics are more complicated .",
    "strong dynamical nuclear spin effects have been observed in gaas double quantum dots in the spin blockade regime under conditions of electron spin resonance  @xcite .",
    "nuclear spin flips in this setup are due to second order processes , and some of the transitions have a vanishingly small energy difference between initial and virtual state , which can not be dealt with in a standard fermi golden rule approach  @xcite .",
    "the situation is even worse for systems with strong spin - orbit coupling . in inas nanowire double quantum dots in the spin blockade regime , signatures of strong dynamic polarization",
    "have been observed too  @xcite . in this case , the presence of too many comparable energy scales makes it impossible to choose a unique set of basis states to describe the electron dynamics in  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a basis - independent description of the coupled electron - nuclear spin dynamics , not involving any separate transition rates , is highly desirable .    in this work we present an alternative method to evaluate the spin dynamics of electrons and nuclei coupled to each other by hyperfine interaction .",
    "we show that , in order to describe the nuclear spin dynamics up to second order in the hyperfine coupling , it suffices to evaluate the fluctuations and susceptibility of the electron spins in the system , which can be done using linear response theory .",
    "our approach does not rely on the calculation of separate transition rates with fermi s golden rule , nor on the choice of electronic basis states to work in . as a result",
    ", our formalism may be applicable in cases where fermi s golden rule can not be used , and thus provides a useful alternative . since a fermi s golden rule ( fgr ) calculation often has to be adapted to specific circumstances  @xcite , it is difficult to pick a single implementation of it and make a good comparison to our approach .",
    "therefore we will illustrate our ideas with two example systems : ( i ) we will show how in a simplest toy system our formalism and a smart implementation of fgr produce identical results .",
    "( ii ) we will investigate a more complicated system , which can not be dealt with in an fgr approach , and show how our formalism straightforwardly produces an equation for the hyperfine driven nuclear spin dynamics .",
    "let us start with presenting the main result of our work : an equation for the hyperfine driven dynamics of the expectation value of a nuclear spin coupled to ( many ) electronic spins . under conditions which we will specify below",
    ", this equation takes the closed form @xmath0 where @xmath1 , and we use the convention that over repeated indices still has to be summed .",
    "the operator @xmath2 is the nuclear spin operator for the nucleus under consideration , and @xmath3 is the permutation tensor .",
    "the vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the matrix @xmath6 are defined as @xmath7 @xmath8 being the material - specific hyperfine coupling energy , @xmath9 the density of nuclei , @xmath10 the total nuclear spin , @xmath11 the position of the nucleus , and @xmath12 the electron spin density operator , @xmath13 .",
    "note that we have set for transparency @xmath14 , or , in other words , we express all energies in terms of corresponding frequencies .",
    "we further assumed for simplicity only one type of spin - carrying nuclei present , having a constant density .",
    "the symbols @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent correlation functions of the local electronic spin density , @xmath17_+\\rangle_c dt'\\\\ \\chi^{ab } & = -i \\int^t \\langle [ \\hat s^a({\\bf r}_n , t),\\hat s^b({\\bf r}_n , t')]_-\\rangle_c dt ' , \\end{split } \\label{eq : chir}\\ ] ] where the square brackets denote the ( anti)commutator of two operators , i.e. , @xmath18_\\pm = \\hat a\\hat b\\pm \\hat b\\hat a$ ] , and the subscript @xmath19 means that we have to use the ` connected ' part of the expectation value , i.e. , remove the contribution of the averages @xmath20 .    note that , since hyperfine interaction works two - way , the electronic dynamics , and thereby @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , can in turn also be affected by the state of the nuclear spins in the system .",
    "this creates a feedback mechanism in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdtfin ] ) , which makes the equation non - linear .",
    "however , in all practical implementations , one can make use of the large difference in time scales of the electronic and nuclear spin dynamics .",
    "this allows to treat the ensemble of nuclear spins effectively as a static ` classical ' magnetic field when evaluating the electronic correlators .    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdtfin ] ) is first order in the hyperfine coupling @xmath8 and gives rise to a precession of the nuclear spin around the direction of the time - averaged local electron spin polarization .",
    "the precession frequency depends on the magnitude of this polarization @xmath21 , as well as on the strength @xmath8 of the hyperfine coupling .",
    "the other two terms are second order in @xmath8 , and describe the effect on the nucleus of fluctuations of electron spin .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath22 in the matrix @xmath6 are ordered as the ` classical ' noise of electron spin @xmath23 .",
    "it persists even if the quantum operator of spin is replaced with a classical fluctuating field affecting the nuclear spin .",
    "since such fluctuations cause random rotation of this spin and therefore isotropization of its density matrix , the effect of @xmath22 is relaxation of the nuclear spin .",
    "the correlators @xmath24 in the vector @xmath5 have the same structure as a kubo formula and give the stationary susceptibility , that is , the response of @xmath25 in the point @xmath11 to a constant magnetic field in the @xmath26-direction , concentrated in the same point .",
    "one can interpret the @xmath24 as the ` quantum ' noise of electron spin : the part of the fluctuations in @xmath23 which solely exists due to the non - commutativity of the spin operators .",
    "it is worth to note that pumping of the nuclear spin is produced by the asymmetric part of the tensor @xmath24 only .",
    "the onsager relations state that susceptibilities are symmetric for an equilibrium system , @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , pumping can only take place if the electron part of the system is driven out of equilibrium by some external agent .    in order to find an explicit expression for @xmath28 as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdtfin ] ) , one needs to find the elements of @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "the first step is to find the steady - state electron spin density @xmath29 , which immediately yields the vector @xmath4 .",
    "the elements of @xmath6 and @xmath5 correspond to the local fluctuations and susceptibility of this electron spin density , and can be evaluated using linear response theory , as we will illustrate below .",
    "let us emphasize here that none of the steps in such a calculation involves the evaluation of any separate transition rate between different electronic - nuclear levels or depends on the specific choice of electronic basis states .",
    "we will now show how to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdtfin ] ) from a second order perturbation theory in the hyperfine interaction .",
    "we start from an effective equation of motion for the reduced density matrix @xmath30 of the nuclear spins which reads up to second order in the perturbation @xmath31 ( see the appendix for a derivation ) @xmath32_- \\\\ & - \\int^t [ \\hat h_\\text{hf}(t ) , [ \\hat h_\\text{hf}(t'),\\hat \\rho^e_0\\otimes\\hat\\rho^k ] _ -]_- dt'\\big\\ } , \\end{split } \\label{eq:2ohf}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the electronic part of the ( quasi-)stationary density matrix described by the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath34 .",
    "this hamiltonian includes all processes and degrees of freedom which are relevant for the electron spin dynamics , such as ( e.g.  in a transport setup ) all leads and tunnel couplings to these leads .",
    "the trace @xmath35 denotes a trace over the electronic degrees of freedom , where the horizontal bar indicates that from the resulting correlation functions only the fully connected contribution should be taken into account ( see appendix ) .",
    "the perturbation @xmath31 accounts for the hyperfine interaction which couples the nuclear spins to the local electron spin density . assuming that the electrons of interest have @xmath36-type orbitals",
    ", we use @xmath37 where the index @xmath38 determines , as above , the spin component of the operators , @xmath39 .",
    "the operators are represented in the interaction picture ( see the appendix ) , which means that their time - dependence is governed by @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that the nuclear spins evolve on a time scale which is much longer than that of the electron spin dynamics , so that for all times of interest we can use @xmath41 .",
    "we see that , if we focus on the dynamics of one specific nuclear spin ( as we will do below ) , our perturbative approach requires that @xmath42 is much smaller than the energy scales in the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath34 .",
    "we then substitute the perturbation ( [ eq : hfint ] ) into the equation of motion ( [ eq:2ohf ] ) , make use of the fact that a trace is invariant under cyclic permutation of the operators in its argument , and then finally arrive at    @xmath43_- \\\\ & -(av_0)^2 \\sum_{n , m } \\bigg\\ { \\int^t \\langle \\hat s^a({\\bf r}_n , t)\\hat s^b({\\bf r}_m , t')\\rangle_c dt ' [ \\hat k^a_n , \\hat k^b_m \\hat\\rho^k ] _ - - \\int^t \\langle \\hat s^b({\\bf r}_m , t')\\hat s^a({\\bf r}_n , t)\\rangle_c dt ' [ \\hat k^a_n,\\hat\\rho^k\\hat k^b_m ] _ -\\bigg\\ } , \\end{split } \\label{eq : drkdt2}\\ ] ]    where now brackets are used to denote the trace over the electronic part of the density matrix , @xmath44 in general , and @xmath45 for the fully connected terms . from ( [ eq : drkdt2 ] ) we can derive equations of motion for the expectation values of the nuclear spin operators .",
    "let us first focus on the transparent case of one single nucleus with nuclear spin @xmath47 , interacting with a local electron spin density .",

    "obviously , the traces appearing in ( [ eq : dkdt1 ] ) and the corresponding averages @xmath50 involve tracing and averaging over the nuclear spin part of the system only .",

    "the exchange of angular momentum between electrons and the nucleus is to leading order described by the second term in ( [ eq : drkdt2 ] ) , i.e. , second order in @xmath52 .",
    "we write the correlation functions of the electron spin in terms of the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath24 introduced in ( [ eq : chir ] ) , and make again use of the cyclic invariance of the trace . for the convenient case of @xmath46 , we can simplify products of nuclear spin operators using @xmath53 . along these lines",

    "we notice two practical problems with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdt3 ] ) .",
    "first of all , for @xmath62 we can not use the relation @xmath63 to simplify products of nuclear spin operators , and secondly , also correlations @xmath64 between _ different _ nuclei play a role .",
    "this makes it impossible to derive from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdt3 ] ) a closed set of equations for @xmath56 .",
    "however , typically the number of nuclear spins in the ensemble is large ( @xmath65@xmath66 ) . when focusing on the dynamics of one single nuclear spin , as we do in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdt3 ] ) , the presence of the large number of other nuclear spins can , to first approximation , be considered as a static ` classical ' field . in other words",
    ", we can assume the fluctuations in the nuclear field @xmath67 to be much smaller than the average values of the field @xmath68 .",
    "this assumption then allows us to replace @xmath69 in the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdt3 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize here that in a standard fgr calculation , the same assumption is implicitly used : transition rates between different spin states of a single nucleus are evaluated , ignoring any possible corrections due to correlations between this spin and the other nuclear spins .    with this simplification , the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdt3 ] ) now reads @xmath70 and describes an effective electron mediated internuclear spin - spin coupling .",
    "this effect can be interpreted as a correction to the first - order equation ( [ eq : dkdt1 ] ) : the effective field around which the @xmath71-th nuclear spin precesses is adjusted @xmath72 , i.e. , it acquires a contribution due to the effective field produced by all other nuclear spins , mediated by the electron spin  @xcite .    the third term in ( [ eq : dkdt3 ] )",
    "contains products of spin operators of the _ same _ nucleus , and must thus be treated on different footing . in most realistic experimental circumstances ,",
    "the temperature is much larger than the nuclear zeeman energy .",
    "this means that the ( thermal ) equilibrium density matrix of the nuclear spins can be approximated to be isotropic , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "as long as we focus on small deviations from this equilibrium , i.e. , small polarizations @xmath74 , the nuclear spin density matrix is always close to isotropic . in this case",
    ", quadratic terms like @xmath75 will dominate the contribution from @xmath76_+\\rangle_c$ ] in ( [ eq : dkdt3 ] ) , since they are of order unity , @xmath77 .",
    "we thus can concentrate on these quadratic contributions , and approximate @xmath78 .",
    "we see that then finally eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdt3 ] ) reduces to the simple result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdt2 ] ) .",
    "let us repeat here that this reduction is based on two assumptions : ( i ) we neglect the correlations between the nuclear spin under consideration and all other nuclear spins ( as is also done in an fgr calculation ) , and ( ii ) we only allow for small deviations of @xmath79 from equilibrium , so that @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , one does not necessarily have to use these assumptions and make this simplification .",
    "equation ( [ eq : drkdt2 ] ) gives the time - evolution up to second order in @xmath52 of the full nuclear spin density matrix in terms of the electron spin fluctuations and susceptibilities .",
    "one could solve this equation ( numerically ) for any initial condition @xmath80 and calculate the time - dependent expectation value of any desired nuclear spin operator .",
    "with the formalism presented in eqs ( [ eq : dkdtfin])([eq : chir ] ) , we are able to express the hyperfine driven nuclear spin dynamics in terms of the susceptibility and fluctuations of the electron spin density .",
    "let us now explain how one could calculate the necessary electronic correlation functions using linear response theory .",
    "for a given setup , we write down the full set of bloch equations describing the evolution of the electronic density matrix under @xmath34 , and solve for the steady state solution @xmath81 .",
    "the elements @xmath82 are then simply found as the equilibrium expectation values @xmath83 .",
    "next , we add to the set of bloch equations the first - order effect of a perturbation @xmath84 , i.e. , we add the terms @xmath85_-$ ] , and solve for the new steady state density matrix @xmath86 . the spin susceptibility @xmath24 needed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dkdtfin ] ) is then found as the part of @xmath87 which is linear in @xmath88 .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath22 are found in a similar way , the terms to add to the bloch equations then read @xmath89_+ - 2\\mathrm{tr}\\{\\hat h'\\hat\\rho^{(0)}\\}\\hat\\rho^{(0)}$ ] , where the last term removes the connected part of the electron spin correlators",
    ". we will illustrate the procedure below .    from this short outline ,",
    "it is already clear that this approach has several properties which are different from a traditional fgr calculation : ( i ) for an fgr calculation , there should be an obvious basis to calculate all occupation probabilities in . here",
    "we can choose any basis which is most convenient for evaluating the steady state electronic density matrix .",
    "( ii ) when calculating separate fgr transition rates , it should a priori be clear which quantization axis to choose for the nuclear spins . in our formalism , as soon as @xmath86 is found for the two types of perturbations , all elements of @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be read off immediately , yielding the dynamics for the full vector @xmath90 , not just the polarization along a single axis .",
    "( iii ) for fgr to work , all levels involved in the hyperfine transitions ( including possible virtual states in higher order processes ) should be well separated in energy , i.e. , the splittings should be larger than all decay rates and other possible incoherent processes present . in our method",
    "all incoherent processes are accounted for in the set of bloch equations , we do not have to compare them with the other energy scales .",
    "( iv ) in an fgr calculation , when focusing on the nuclear spin dynamics of a small subsystem being part of a larger system ( e.g.  a quantum dot coupled to multiple reservoirs ) , one usually includes only the energy splittings inside the subsystem in the actual perturbation theory .",
    "all other processes relevant for the electron spin dynamics ( such as the coupling to the reservoirs ) have to be accounted for ` afterward ' in an effective density of states , which is not always possible . in our approach",
    ", we treat the coherent and incoherent parts of the dynamics in the subsystem on equal footing .",
    "one advantage is that the perturbation theory in our approach does not break down when the energy splittings in the subsystem vanish , as long as the energies corresponding to the incoherent dynamics are large enough .",
    "let us mention here also a drawback of our method .",
    "our main result ( [ eq : dkdtfin ] ) describes only the dynamics of average nuclear fields @xmath91 .",
    "temporal fluctuations and other stochastic properties of the fields are not accessible via this approach . in an fgr calculation",
    ", one can separate the rates for flipping nuclear spins up and down , and derive from this separation a fokker - planck equation describing the stochastics of the nuclear fields  @xcite .",
    "we will now illustrate the above with a calculation of the nuclear spin pumping in two example systems .",
    "first , we will consider nuclear spin pumping in a trivial toy model concerning a single quantum dot coupled to two leads .",
    "we will show how a smart implementation of fgr can produce an identical result in this case .",
    "then we will investigate a more complicated setup , involving a double quantum dot , which can not be dealt with in an fgr approach .",
    "we will show however how our formalism can be applied without any problem , yielding a general equation for the nuclear spin pumping in this setup .",
    "we consider a single quantum dot connected to two leads , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . due to the strong coulomb repulsion",
    ", only one excess electron can occupy the dot .",
    "if we apply an external magnetic field @xmath92 , the energy levels for spin up and down in the dot are split by the electronic zeeman energy .",
    "we take the tunnel rate into the dot @xmath93 to be very fast and equal for both spin directions .",
    "the outward tunnel rates @xmath94 are different for the two spin directions ( to provide a physical picture with this assumption : one could assume the right lead to be ferromagnetic ) . since the electron occupying the dot will thus have on average a non - zero spin polarization along the @xmath95-direction , hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins is expected to produce a non - zero nuclear spin polarization along this axis .    in typical experiments ,",
    "the temperature ( @xmath96  mk  @xmath97ev ) is much smaller than the orbital level spacing in the dot ( @xmath98  mev ) . in that case , the electron will in principle occupy the orbital ground state of the dot , which has an @xmath36-type character . as long as also",

    "we will focus on nuclear spin pumping in the right dot .",
    "a non - zero nuclear spin pumping rate is expected along the direction of the magnetic field since the average local electron spin polarization along this direction is finite . denoting the level in the left dot by @xmath164 and the two levels in the right dot by @xmath146 and @xmath147 , the hamiltonian for the three - level system reads @xmath165 where the feedback of the nuclear spins on the electron spin dynamics again is incorporated into the effective magnetic field @xmath166 . using this hamiltonian and adding the effect of the incoherent decay rate @xmath154 , we can write down the equations of motion for @xmath167 , and solve for @xmath168 , yielding @xmath169 and zero for the other five elements .",
    "we then proceed as we did above , and add consecutively the perturbations @xmath85_-$ ] and @xmath89_+ - 2\\mathrm{tr}\\{\\hat h'\\hat\\rho^{(0)}\\}\\hat\\rho^{(0)}$ ] to the equations of motion .",
    "we solve in both cases for the new steady - state solution @xmath170 and extract the linear responses needed . combining all together",
    ", we find    @xmath171 } , \\label{eq : sol3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath166 .",
    "this equation gives the nuclear spin pumping in the right dot along the @xmath95-axis , without any restriction imposed on the relative magnitude of the parameters @xmath116 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath154 .",
    "let us now try to evaluate the same pumping using an fgr approach .",
    "the most transparent electronic basis to use is @xmath172 since in this basis we have well - defined incoherent in- and outward tunneling rates .",
    "we see however that the stationary density matrix in this basis ( [ eq : rho03 ] ) has off - diagonal elements . in order to proceed",
    ", we have to make several assumptions .",
    "let us consider the limit of @xmath173 . in this case",
    "the off - diagonal elements of @xmath168 can be neglected , and we can approximate @xmath174 .",
    "we further assume that we have three well - separated levels , i.e. , @xmath175 . in this limit",
    "the nuclear spin pumping is resulting from a second order transition : ( i ) tunneling from the initial state @xmath176 to the virtual state @xmath138 , and then ( ii ) an electron - nuclear spin flip - flop from @xmath138 to the final state @xmath137 .",
    "we thus use a standard second order fermi golden rule to write for the pumping rate @xmath177    where @xmath178 is the tunneling part of the hamiltonian @xmath179 .",
    "the occupation probability of the initial state is @xmath180 .",
    "the ` density ' @xmath144 for this transition is mainly set by the level broadening of the final state , so @xmath181 $ ] .",
    "this yields @xmath182 } , \\label{eq : sol4}\\ ] ] which coincides with ( [ eq : sol3 ] ) in the limit @xmath183 .",
    "( note that @xmath184 is not a necessary condition . )",
    "there are other limits in which considering the right rates to calculate , combined with a good approximation for @xmath185 and a smart choice for @xmath144 , can result in the right pumping rate . in general however , it is not trivial to understand how to incorporate all incoherent dynamics into @xmath144 . even if one would simply diagonalize the stationary density matrix @xmath168 and try to evaluate all hyperfine transitions in the new basis , one would have to transform the incoherent processes in correct effective densities of state .",
    "in the approach using the electron spin susceptibility and fluctuations , this is all done on the fly and its validity is not restricted to certain limits of the parameter space .",
    "let us emphasize here that the fact that a correctly adapted fgr approach did work in our single dot example but not in the double dot example , is only due to the complexity of the coherent and incoherent electron spin dynamics in the two cases .",
    "the success of the fgr approach is not inherently connected to the number of quantum dots in a setup : also for more complicated single dot systems , the fgr approach might break down .",
    "the two examples given above both consider localized electron spins .",
    "our approach however , works in principle equally well for systems with delocalized electrons . in this case , as explained above , the susceptibility and fluctuations needed are correlators of electron spin _ density _",
    "instead of simply electron spin .",
    "this however does not change the complexity of the formalism : one only has to find the right set of ( bloch ) equations to describe the electron spin density .",
    "to conclude , we presented a new approach to evaluate the nuclear spin dynamics driven by hyperfine interaction with non - equilibrium electron spins . to describe the dynamics up to second order in the hyperfine coupling , it suffices to evaluate the susceptibility and fluctuations of the electron spin .",
    "this approach does not rely on a separation of electronic energy scales or the specific choice of electronic basis states , thereby overcoming practical problems which may arise under certain circumstances when using a more traditional formalism based on rate equations .",
