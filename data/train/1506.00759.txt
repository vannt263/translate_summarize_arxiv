    "k - shell iron lines are one of the most remarkable features in the galactic diffuse x - ray emission ( galactic center x - ray emission : gcxe and the galactic ridge x - ray emission : grxe ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the iron lines largely extends out to @xmath4  along the plane .",
    "a deep observation of the grxe near the galactic center ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) has resolved almost all the grxe flux into point sources @xcite .",
    "this fact demonstrates that the origin of the iron lines is due to a superposition of many point sources such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and coronally active binaries ( abs ) @xcite . the spectroscopic studies with _ asca _ , _ xmm - newton _",
    ", _ chandra _ , and _ suzaku _ revealed that the k - shell iron lines are separated into three lines at 6.4 ( neutral iron ) , 6.7 ( he - like iron ) , and 7.0 kev ( h - like iron ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray spectra of the grxe and gcxe , however , are not the same , which indicates different origins @xcite . even in the point - source scenario ,",
    "the spectra and the mixing ratio of cvs and abs should be different between the grxe and gcxe . furthermore , the flux distribution of the 6.4 kev line in the gcxe is clumpy , while those of the 6.7 and 7.0  kev lines show a roughly smooth and east - west symmetric distribution with respect to sagittarius ( sgr ) a@xmath0 in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the 6.4 kev clumps in the gcxe have a large equivalent width ( ew @xmath7  kev ) and are time variable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hence their origin is believed to be x - ray reflection and fluorescence by external x - rays of past big flares of sgr a * ( x - ray reflection nebulae ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the clumps , a more uniformly distributed 6.4 kev line emission is found @xcite , and its origin is under debate .",
    "this letter reports the first evidence for a clear east - west asymmetry of the 6.4 kev line emission at @xmath81.53.5 on the galactic disk : the east shows an excess over the west .",
    "based on the spatial and spectral analysis , we discuss the origin of this excess .",
    "errors quoted in this paper are at 90% confidence levels unless otherwise specified .",
    "the distance to the galactic center is assumed to be 8  kpc .",
    "we performed campaign observations of the inner galactic disk near the galactic center at @xmath9 ( west side ) and @xmath10 ( east side ) using the _ suzaku _ x - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "the observation log is listed in table  1 .",
    "the x - ray charge coupled device camera , the xis @xcite , onboard _ suzaku _ covers the energy range of 0.212  kev , and has the field of view of @xmath11 .",
    "we excluded events during the south atlantic anomaly passages , at elevation angles below @xmath12 from the night earth rim , and at elevation angles below @xmath13 from the sunlit earth rim .",
    "we further excluded the data of @xmath14  ks during background flares detected on 17 march 2013 .",
    "we reprocessed the data by using xispi in the analysis software package , heasoft 6.15.1 , and the _ suzaku _ calibration database ( caldb ) released in may 2014 .",
    "after the screening , we obtained the total exposure times of 597  ks and 1187  ks for the west and east data sets , respectively .",
    "a bright x - ray binary , gx3@xmath151 , is located at @xmath16 , which is @xmath17@xmath18 apart from each pointing in the east observations . since some regions of the xis fields of view are contaminated by the stray light from gx3@xmath151 , we used data in the other clean regions .",
    "we excluded circular regions with @xmath19 radii at the positions of point - like sources with fluxes higher than @xmath20  erg  s@xmath21  @xmath22 in 210  kev .",
    "we , furthermore , detected two compact diffuse sources in the east and west regions .",
    "while the west source is identified as g357.7@xmath230.1 ( tornado nebula : @xcite ) , no counterpart is found for the east source , which is located at @xmath24 .",

    "the iron abundance of 11.5 solar was also measured in the x - ray reflection nebulae in sgr b with the absorption of the fe - k edge @xcite .",
    "the same result was obtained by mid - infrared observations ; @xcite obtained 2  solar for heavy elements of neon , sulfur , and argon ( not of iron ) , and @xcite and @xcite measured the iron abundance to be 11.5  solar .",
    "therefore , we adopt the iron abundance of 11.5  solar in figure  3 .",
    "the ew in the x - ray scenario also depends on the angle @xmath57 between the line of sight and the incident photon direction @xcite .",
    "figure  3 shows the result of the reflection angle @xmath58 , which gives the maximum ew .",
    "the black horizontal line in figure  3 indicates the best - fit ew , while the horizontal hatched region shows the range of the statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the allowed parameter region completely excludes the electron origin .",
    "then , we discuss the others , the x - ray and proton scenarios in the following subsections .          in the x - ray irradiation scenario ,",
    "the 6.4 kev line flux depends on the irradiating source flux , the hydrogen column density ( @xmath59 ) , and the distance ( @xmath60 ) between the irradiating source and the target .",
    "the hydrogen column density @xmath61(26)@xmath62  @xmath22 is obtained by multiplying the @xmath36co line intensity in figure  1 by the conversion factor ( called @xmath63-factor ) of @xmath64  @xmath22  ( k@xmath65 km  s@xmath21)@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "a possible irradiating source is the supermassive black hole sgr a@xmath0 , as for the x - ray reflection nebula model invoked for the gc region @xcite . in this case , the source luminosity should be @xmath66  erg  s@xmath21 about @xmath67 years ago , where @xmath60 is the distance of the 6.4 kev line emitting region from sgr a@xmath0 . for the x - ray reflection nebulae in sgr b ,",
    "the luminosity of sgr a@xmath0 was @xmath68  erg  s@xmath21 about 300 years ago @xcite .",
    "brighter flares of @xmath69  erg  s@xmath21 in the far past ( 10@xmath7010@xmath71 years ago ) have been proposed to explain the fermi bubbles and the recombining plasma in the south region of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "thus , many big flares in the interval period between these two epochs ( @xmath567001500 years ago ) may be conceivable . however , this scenario has two difficulties .",
    "the first difficulty comes from the longitudinal distribution of the excess flux of the 6.4 kev line .",
    "the observed excess flux is proportional to the @xmath36co intensity , which means that the x - ray intensity from sgr a@xmath0 is almost constant , and does not decrease as the square of the galactic longitude , or the distance from sgr a@xmath0 ; the past sgr a@xmath0 flares should have smoothly increasing flux with the square of the look - back time .",
    "a monotonous smooth decrease of flux should continue during 7001500 years ago , which is artificial , although not completely rejected .",
    "the second difficulty comes from the flux ratio of the 6.4 kev line to the @xmath36co intensity ( here , @xmath27 ) in the molecular cloud clump  2 .",
    "clump  2 extends toward the north from the galactic plane and has an elliptical shape with major and minor axes of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "we estimate the excess 6.4 kev line flux from the on - plane ( @xmath74 ; obs .",
    "id=507073010 ) and off - plane ( @xmath750.40 ; obs.id=507074010 and 507075010 ) parts of clump  2 by subtracting the symmetrical component from the observed flux , and obtained @xmath27 of @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the on- and off - plane parts , respectively ( unit is photons  s@xmath21  @xmath22  arcmin@xmath49 ( k@xmath65 km  s@xmath21)@xmath21 ) . since the flux from sgr a@xmath0 would be equal in the small separation angle between on- and off - plane parts , @xmath27 should be also equal , which is in conflict with the observed values . from these two difficulties , we regard that the x - ray irradiation by sgr a@xmath0 is unlikely .",
    "the other possibility is that irradiation of many x - ray binaries in the east is responsible for the 6.4  kev line .",
    "this idea is essentially the same as @xcite . assuming that a mean spectrum of the relevant x - ray binaries is a power law with the photon index of @xmath78 , and is surrounded by cold material with @xmath79@xmath80  @xmath22 , a fraction of 0.030.1% of the total 210 kev flux is converted to 6.4  kev x - rays .",
    "we estimate the excess 6.4  kev luminosity in total to be @xmath81  erg  s@xmath21 in the relevant area of @xmath82 .",
    "then , a total luminosity of @xmath83@xmath84  erg  s@xmath21 is required to the sources inside the area .",
    "this flux exceeds the total luminosity of the grxe in this region ( @xmath85  erg  s@xmath21 ) by one or two order of magnitude .",
    "no source brighter than @xmath86  erg  s@xmath21 is found in this area . therefore ,",
    "more than one or two order of magnitude brighter flares within the relevant regions and duration of the past @xmath87 years are required .",
    "in addition , the reflection angle @xmath57 should be distributed randomly .",
    "then the ew integrated over the reflection angle @xmath57 is @xmath1  times lower than the green belt in figure  3 ( reflection angle @xmath58 ) , and hence is out of the allowed range .",
    "thus this scenario is also unlikely .      in the proton model ,",
    "the excess flux of the 6.4 kev line @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath59 are the cross section to produce the 6.4 kev line by protons , the velocity , the number density at 1  mev and the energy of protons , and the line - of - sight hydrogen column density , respectively .",
    "the spectral index of @xmath94 is adopted from the best - fit result ( see figure  3 )",
    ". using the @xmath63-factor of @xmath64  @xmath22  ( k@xmath65 km  s@xmath21)@xmath21 @xcite , the 6.4 kev line flux is expressed as the @xmath36co line intensity multiplied by the conversion factor @xmath27 , which is measured to be @xmath95  photons  s@xmath21  @xmath22  arcmin@xmath49  ( k@xmath65 km  s@xmath21)@xmath21 in figure  1 .",
    "the cross section @xmath96 has a peak at 10  mev and rapidly decreases below 1  mev and above 50  mev @xcite .",
    "we set the integration range to be 150  mev , and then obtained the normalization @xmath97  protons  @xmath3 and the energy density of 20  ev  @xmath3 .",
    "when the integration range is expanded to be 0.11000  mev , the energy density becomes 80  ev  @xmath3 .",
    "this is about one or two orders of magnitude higher than the canonical value @xmath98  ev  @xmath3 that is determined by observing high - energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated an energy conversion rate from protons to the 6.4 kev line to be @xmath99 or less . since the total luminosity of the 6.4 kev line emission is @xmath100  erg  s@xmath21 , the proton power of @xmath101  erg  s@xmath21 is estimated .",
    "this is not far from the energy @xmath102  erg  s@xmath21 that protons input to the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the diffusion length of low - energy ( @xmath56mev ) protons is only a few tens of parsecs @xcite , and therefore the mev protons should be produced _ in situ _ , possibly by a supernova remnant or a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "however , no candidate source is found in the vicinity .",
    "@xcite indicated that cosmic - ray particles are possibly generated with stochastic acceleration by alfvnic turbulence in the central molecular zone with large velocity dispersion of @xmath103  km  s@xmath21 .",
    "since clump  2 exhibits large velocity dispersion of @xmath104  km  s@xmath21 @xcite , another possibility to produce the mev protons is the stochastic acceleration .",

    "<S> a common idea for the origin of the galactic diffuse x - ray emission , particularly that of the iron lines from neutral and highly ionized atoms , is a superposition of many cataclysmic variables and coronally active binaries . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> , the flux should symmetrically distribute between the east and west on the plane with respect to sagittarius a@xmath0 because the stellar mass distribution determined by infrared observations is nearly symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry is confirmed for the highly ionized iron line as well as the continuum emission . </S>",
    "<S> however , a clear excess of the neutral iron line in the near east of the galactic center compared to the near - west side is found . </S>",
    "<S> the flux distribution of the excess emission well correlates with molecular column density . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectrum of the excess emission is described by a power - law continuum plus a 6.4  kev line with the large equivalent width of @xmath1  kev , which is hardly explained by the low - energy electron bombardment scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal and latitudinal distribution of the excess emission disfavors the x - ray irradiation , neither by sagittarius a@xmath0 nor by nearby x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> then the low - energy proton bombardment is the most probable origin although the high energy density @xmath2  ev  @xmath3 in 0.11000  mev is required and there is no conventional proton source in the vicinity . </S>"
