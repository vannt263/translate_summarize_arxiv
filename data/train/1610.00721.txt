''",
    "after analysis of the complete light curve , the system is currently listed as a false positive .",
    "the q1 - 17 dvr for this system indicates that there are two major causes of the disposition discrepancies : the presence of a secondary eclipse and an apparent offset of the psf centroid compared with out - of - transit observations .",
    "these centroid offsets are generally inside the 3-@xmath18 radius of confusion for the weighted mean offset , with the exception of quarters q5 , 9 , 13 , and 17 . as the _ kepler _ spacecraft rotated @xmath19 every 90 days , these four discrepant quarters occurred separated in time by a full _ kepler _ rotation such that star fell on the same pixels .",
    "examination of the pixel mask used for these quarters shows that there are no detected nearby stars that caused the significant centroid offsets described in the dvr .",

    "@xmath152 is neglected because the resulting inversions were qualitatively very different from those for the other inclinations , since the small inclination leads to little modulation unless the spots are unrealistically large .    as the light curve of koi-1003 shows activity manifesting as both starspots and flares , we removed the data containing flares .",
    "we identified the flares by eye ( as rapid increases in flux followed by an exponential decline , as described by * ? ? ? * ) and manually removed the affected data . like the starspots , we assume that the flares are associated with the primary star due to its brightness compared to the secondary .",
    "we additionally removed the data for the primary transit and secondary eclipse .",
    "the light curve free of systematic _ kepler _ variations ( accounted for with the cbvs ) , transits , eclipses , and flares left only the features we believe to be the result of cool starspots .",
    "we divided the light curves into sections the length of a single rotation period and binned the data into fifty bins of equal duration in order to reduce computation time ( @xmath7 observations in each bin ) .",
    "the light curves for individual rotation periods were inverted using li .",
    "the resultant surface reconstructions of these inversions are included in the appendix . to analyze the starspots , we identified surface patches as being a starspot patch when the intensity of the patch is darker than 95% of the average patch intensity .",
    "we calculated the weighted average latitude and longitude .",
    "we again note that the latitude information obtained from the inversions is not reliable , as only limited latitude information can be retrieved from a single photometric band . here",
    ", we only utilized the spot longitude .      to understand the motion of the starspots , we plotted starspot longitude against time ( assigning the entire rotation the time of the first data point in the light curve ) , as in the example of figure [ longvtime ] .",
    "for each inclination , we saw that there are two distinct spot structures ( consisting of a number of spots that grow and disappear over time ) that slowly change in longitude , suggesting that the starspots are rotating around the surface more slowly than the assumed stellar rotation .",
    "we suggest that these regions of persistent starspots are `` active longitudes , '' as observed on other active stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "to determine the rate of starspot rotation , we found the slope of the two regions where the motion of the spots over time are distinct , between bjd 2455318.64382 and 2455828.94975 ( roughly between bjd @xmath10 2454833 = 500 @xmath101000 in figure [ longvtime ] ) .",
    "the slopes ( @xmath153 ) and the associated rotation periods are found in table [ slopeper ] .",

    "the starspots appear to be located at different latitudes suggesting differential rotation .    , which has two starspots with rotation periods that closely match the strongest two peaks in figure [ pgram ] .",
    "the spot with the rotation period most closely matching that of the rotational period assigned to the system is found consistently around @xmath154 in longitude . the other , higher latitude spot ( assuming differential rotation in the solar sense given the negative slope present here ) changes in longitude throughout the _ kepler _ light curve .",
    "[ longvtime ] ]    these two spot structures are continuously present ; therefore , we expected their rotation periods to be present in our period search . comparing the rotation periods",
    "predicted in table [ slopeper ] to those rotation periods detected in figure [ pgram ] , we found that the rotation periods are associated with the two strongest peaks .",
    "we assume differential rotation in the same sense as the sun and designate the spot with a shorter rotation period as the lower latitude spot ( the spot consistently around a longitude of @xmath154 in figure [ longvtime ] ) .",
    "we note that this low - latitude spot does not move across the surface in a linear way suggesting that the spot is changing latitude ( see slight curvature between days 500 and 1000 ( bjd @xmath10 2454833 ) of the spot around longitude @xmath155 of figure [ longvtime ] ) .",
    "because of this , we expect a rotation period present deviating slightly from the low - latitude spot s rotation period .",
    "the chosen rotation period ( 8.23  days ) for the star is likely tied to the motion of this starspot .",
    "the high - latitude spot has more linear trend suggesting that the rotation period of this starspot would be present in the periodogram .",
    "the rotation period for the high - latitude spot reasonably matches the strongest peak present ( 8.30  days ) .",

    "this discrepancy can be explained by noting that the spots used to determine the best estimate for the rotation period do not necessarily reflect the mean rotation rate of the star . in order for this ( near-)synchronization to have occurred for koi-1003",
    ", the tidal forces of the primary and secondary would need to be significant ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , supporting our requirement of the secondary to be a main sequence star . since theory also determines that the orbit of koi-1003 should be circular ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we suggest that the system is a marginal case in the middle of this process , as its periods near the boundary of main - sequence circularization . therefore , because synchronization occurs before circularization ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and koi-1003 is nearly synchronized , the binary will soon be circularized .",
    "we found that the starspots modeled with li , regardless of inclination , have spot rotation periods that match reasonably well those found in the two most significant peaks of the period search .",
