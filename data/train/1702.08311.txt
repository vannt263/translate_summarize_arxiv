    "as one of the first examples of single - field slow - roll inflation , starobinsky proposed a model of extended gravity with @xmath6 that leads to a scalar field theory with an exponentially flat potential @xcite . by means of a legendre - weyl transformation the non - trivial gravity action can be recast into the form of einstein - hilbert gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field , @xmath7 , whose scalar potential takes the form @xmath8 this model of inflation is , over three decades after its proposal , compatible with the latest observational constraints @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study possible generalisations of the underlying @xmath9 theory in @xmath0 dimensions ; it is based on @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been further research in this direction @xcite , which shares some of the conclusions of the present work , without addressing the important aspect of moduli stabilisation . whenever higher - dimensional theories are compactified , deformation modes of the internal manifold enter the four - dimensional effective field theory ( eft ) as additional scalar fields .",
    "usually those fields must be stabilised in a suitable way to not cause a variety of problems .",
    "we study the interplay between inflation from @xmath9 gravity in higher dimensional spacetimes and moduli stabilisation using a simple toy model .",
    "we show that , without ingredients other than the gravitational action and a cosmological constant , the potential is generically unstable along the direction of the volume of the compact space . following the original idea of freund and rubin @xcite",
    ", we demonstrate that non - vanishing two - form flux on the compact space can lead to sufficiently stable minima with a minkowski or de sitter space - time in four dimensions .",
    "however , we show that there are no stable inflationary trajectories ending in those minima .",
    "while for large values of the scalar field @xmath7 the potential features a plateau  as in the original starobinsky model  this plateau is always unstable in the direction of the volume modulus .",
    "finally , we propose a solution to this problem using a more general @xmath4-form flux background on the compact space .",
    "this allows us to separate moduli stabilisation from the inflationary dynamics .",
    "this work fits well in a line with previous studies of plateau inflation in higher - dimensional theories .",
    "for example , the authors of @xcite use a similarly simple toy model of moduli stabilisation to investigate its interplay with inflationary theories .",
    "moreover , the past decade has seen substantial progress in string theory implementations of plateau inflation models , also including the study of moduli stability , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we first give the ansatz for the @xmath2-dimensional @xmath9 theory .",
    "second , we give the resulting four - dimensional action for the two involved scalar fields in the einstein frame , after compactification on a sphere .",
    "third , we demonstrate that two - form flux can not sufficiently stabilise the volume modulus during inflation .",
    "finally , we solve this problem by introducing @xmath4-form flux on the sphere and discuss the ensuing observational footprint of the model .",
    "in section 3 we conclude , and compile the details regarding the main result , which is the four - dimensional action in einstein frame , in appendix a.",
    "the starting point of our discussion is a generalisation of starobinsky s model in @xmath2 space - time dimensions . following @xcite",
    "the @xmath2-dimensional action features an einstein - hilbert term , a higher - order curvature term , a cosmological constant , and the kinetic term of a @xmath10-form gauge potential . in total",
    ", we have @xmath11 where latexmath:[\\ ] ] where have used .",
    "this is the result given in section [ sec : comp ] , where we set @xmath24 and omit the hats and indices on @xmath22 and @xmath23 for clarity .",
