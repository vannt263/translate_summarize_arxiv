    "over the past decades , together with the development of the theory of quantum information  @xcite there has been an increasing effort to find those physical systems where quantum information processing could be implemented . among the many different proposals , devices based on superconducting josephson junctions",
    "are promising candidates in the solid state realm ( see the reviews in ref .  ) .",
    "josephson qubits can be categorized into three main classes : charge , phase and flux qubits , depending on which dynamical variable is most well defined and consequently which basis states are used as computational states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "phase qubits  @xcite , subject of the present investigation , in their simplest configuration can be realized with a single current biased josephson junction . for bias",
    "lower that the critical current , the two lowest eigenstates of the system form the computational space .",
    "the application of a current pulse , with frequency which is in resonance with the transition frequency of the two logical states , typically in the microwave range , allows to perform all desired single bit operations .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite have realized both single - bit and two - bit gates in capacitive coupled phase qubits . in the experiments conducted so far , motivated by similar approach in nmr , the amplitude of the microwave current used to perform the qubit manipulation has a gaussian shape  @xcite .",
    "the importance of achieving fast quantum gates with high fidelity rises the question whether there are modulations , other than gaussian , which lead to higher fidelities .",
    "indeed , gaussian pulses act better when their duration time is longer @xcite , therefore the search for modulations which result in high fidelity gates , even when the duration time of the pulse is short , seems to be necessary .",
    "some theoretical work has already been done in this direction to examine the efficiency of different modulations  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we follow a different approach as compared to ref . and show that by employing the quantum optimal control theory @xcite , we can further improve the ( theoretical ) bounds on the error of gate operations .",
    "quantum optimal control has been already applied to optimize quantum manipulation of josephson nanocircuits in the charge limit  @xcite . here",
    "we want to test this method in the opposite regime of phase qubit  @xcite and see whether it is possible to find optimal modulations of microwave pulses , with different duration times , which give very good fidelity for single bit operations .",

    "<S> in a josephson phase qubit the coherent manipulations of the computational states are achieved by modulating an applied ac current , typically in the microwave range . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to find optimal modulations of the bias current to achieve high - fidelity gates . </S>",
    "<S> we apply quantum optimal control theory to determine the form of the pulses and study in details the case of a not - gate . to test the efficiency of the optimized pulses in an experimental setup </S>",
    "<S> , we also address the effect of possible imperfections in the pulses shapes , the role of off - resonance elements in the hamiltonian , and the effect of capacitive interaction with a second qubit . </S>"
