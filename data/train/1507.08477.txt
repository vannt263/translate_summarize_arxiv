    "in isogeometric analysis , as it was introduced in @xcite , the physical domain is usually parametrized smoothly by tensor - product b - splines or nurbs , therefore it has to be diffeomorphic to a rectangle .",
    "when dealing with geometrically complex domains , there is a need for a more flexible geometry representation .",
    "several approaches have been proposed so far .",
    "we would like to point out several common strategies that can be studied within the framework we present in this paper .",
    "one is to use a multi - patch representation of the domain , i.e. to split the domain into rectangular or hexahedral boxes .",
    "starting from the framework presented in @xcite , there exist several contributions on multi - patch representations in isogeometric analysis @xcite . in most constructions ,",
    "the basis functions are only @xmath1 across patch interfaces .",
    "we want to point out the recent paper @xcite , in which the authors present a construction to enhance the smoothness across patch interfaces away from extraordinary features .",
    "another way to handle complex geometries is to use a specific set of non - tensor product function spaces , such as unstructured t - splines ( see @xcite as well as @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "the resulting function spaces are very similar to the ones proposed in sections [ sec : dual - basis - construction ] and [ sec : properties - dual - compatible ] .",
    "we however follow a slightly different approach to represent the parameter domain and define the function spaces over it .",
    "smooth constructions over general quad meshes can be introduced by means of subdivision surfaces .",
    "they have been studied in the context of isogeometric analysis in @xcite .",
    "we do not go into the details of subdivision based constructions , but want to point out the relation to the manifold based framework .",
    "function spaces based on subdivision schemes that generalize tensor - product b - splines , such as doo - sabin ( see @xcite ) for biquadratics or catmull - clark ( see @xcite ) for bicubics , can be interpreted as spline manifold spaces . in both cases ,",
    "the function space is spanned by standard tensor - product b - splines as well as certain special functions near extraordinary points .",
    "the special functions are piecewise polynomials over infinitely many rings of quadrilateral elements .    in this paper",
    "we consider spline manifold spaces as a theoretical tool in isogeometric analysis .",
    "note that it is not the purpose of this study to introduce a new way to define or implement unstructured spline spaces .",
    "the aim is rather to develop a framework to study the theoretical properties of a wide range of spline representations over non - rectangular parameter domains based on manifolds .",
    "concerning spline manifolds we refer to @xcite , where the authors propose an abstraction of the concept of geometry parametrizations that is based on a manifold structure . in the proposed framework , the underlying parameter domain forms a manifold , thus allowing to represent more general geometric domains .    in the following",
    "we briefly review the concept of a geometric domain which is parametrized by spline manifolds , and discuss its main features .",
    "we consider a domain @xmath2 which can be interpreted as a @xmath3-dimensional manifold with @xmath4 .",
    "we mostly focus on a two - dimensional planar domain @xmath5 , a surface @xmath6 or a three - dimensional volumetric domain @xmath7 . in an abstract setting ,",
    "a manifold @xmath8 is defined by an _",
    "i.e. , a family of charts @xmath9 such that @xmath10 together with suitable transition maps between intersecting charts @xmath9 and @xmath11 . to define @xmath8 as a spline manifold",
    ", we must define a family of _ open _ parameter subdomains @xmath12 , together with a spline space on each subdomain , and each chart is the image of a _ spline parametrization _ @xmath13 .",
    "the union of the subdomains @xmath12 forms an unstructured parameter domain @xmath14 , and suitable transition functions between the subdomains , together with a relation between the corresponding spline spaces , endow @xmath14 with a manifold structure , which is inherited by @xmath8 .",
    "notice that to cover completely the domain @xmath14 , the open parameter subdomains @xmath12 overlap .",
    "hence , in order to cover the extraordinary points ( or edges ) it is necessary that some of the subdomains @xmath12 also have an unstructured configuration , and non - tensor product spline functions need to be defined .",
    "this is in contrast to traditional multi - patch representations , where only the patch boundaries intersect , and the ( closed ) domain is defined as the union of the closure of the patches .    in section",
    "[ sec : parameter - manifold ] we recall and study the notion of a parameter manifold as presented in @xcite .",
    "we introduce the mesh on the parameter manifold and corresponding mesh constraints in section [ sec : mesh ] . in section [ sec : splinemanifoldspaces ] we introduce spline manifold spaces based on tensor product b - splines and relate them to existing constructions @xcite .",
    "finally , we develop the framework of analysis suitable spline manifold spaces in section [ sec : analysis - suitable ] , where we extend the notion of dual - compatibility to b - spline manifolds . in the main part of the paper",
    "we assume that the manifold has no boundary .",
    "for a more detailed study of spline manifolds with boundary see appendix [ appendix : boundary ] .",
    "we conclude the paper and present possible extensions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "before we can define unstructured spline spaces on manifolds we need to introduce the abstract representation of the parameter domain , the so - called _ parameter manifold_. the following definitions are taken from @xcite .",
    "the definitions are valid for arbitrary dimension @xmath3 , but we will mostly consider @xmath15 .",

    "the hatched regions represent corresponding transition domains .",
    "in general , the transition domains @xmath46 may be empty .",
    "it follows directly from the cocycle condition that the transition function @xmath47 is the identity function on @xmath48 and that @xmath49 for all @xmath30 .",
    "the last condition in definition [ defi : proto - manifold ] is taken from @xcite .",
    "it guarantees that the proto - manifold actually represents a manifold , i.e. that there are no bifurcations of the domain .",
    "note that this condition is not necessary for the following definitions .",
    "however , if the condition is omitted , the resulting object is not a manifold anymore .    in the next section",
    "the charts @xmath50 will be used as ( local ) parameter domains to define splines . by merging and identifying the charts of the proto - manifold we obtain a manifold , which will serve as the parameter domain in our setting , thus the name _",
