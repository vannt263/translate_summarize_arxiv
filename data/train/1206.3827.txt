    "presently , graphene is considered as a prospective material for nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.@xcite among the various experimental techniques , the raman spectroscopy has proven to be an indispensable tool for investigation of this material.@xcite    graphene has a single raman - active phonon @xmath2 observed as an intense line ( the g band ) in the first - order raman spectra .",
    "the second - order spectra of graphene with low defect density has several intense bands , which originate from scattering of electrons and holes by two phonons of the same / different frequency and non - zero momentum and are called overtone / combination bands .",
    "the appearance of intense second - order bands can be explained by the double - resonant ( dr ) scattering mechanism.@xcite these bands contain valuable information on the phonon dispersion@xcite and the electron - phonon and electron - electron matrix elements.@xcite the raman spectra of graphene with defects show additional bands , which arise from dr scattering of electrons and holes by phonons and defects .",
    "the theoretical investigation of the two - phonon dr scattering in graphene has been performed using various approximations : replacement of the electron - photon and electron - phonon interactions with constants , using a constant electronic lifetime , considering only high - symmetry directions in the brillouin zone , as well as exact dr conditions .",
    "the predicted dispersive behavior of the raman bands@xcite and the frequency shift of the stokes and anti - stokes raman bands@xcite have been found in quantitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "it has also been realized that the integration over the entire brillouin zone of graphene is essential for predicting the raman intensity.@xcite while most of the theoretical papers focus on the most intense overtone band , in a recent study , all two - phonon raman bands with observable intensity have been calculated using an electron - phonon matrix element derived within a nearest - neighbor @xmath3-band tight - binding model.@xcite the dominant contribution to the two - phonon bands from different parts of the brillouin zone@xcite and from different scattering processes@xcite has also been discussed .",
    "the polarization dependence of the most intense overtone band has been studied experimentally and theoretically.@xcite the progress , made so far in the modeling of the dr bands , has been achieved either with simple @xmath3-band tight - binding models , or with more sophisticated models but relying on approximations of the electron - phonon matrix element , and in most cases concerns only a few intense bands .",
    "our experience indicates that , although the raman shift of the bands is not sensitive to the used matrix element , their raman intensity crucially depends on it .    here , we calculate the two - phonon dr raman spectra of graphene using a non - orthogonal tight - binding ( ntb ) model , which implements parameters derived from a density functional theory ( dft ) study and thus has no adjustable parameters.@xcite in particular , the electronic@xcite and phonon@xcite dispersion , the electron - photon and electron - phonon matrix elements,@xcite as well as the electronic linewidth@xcite are all obtained within this model . the ntb model for electrons and phonons in graphene is introduced in sec .",
    "the calculated two - phonon dr raman spectra of graphene and its polarization dependence are discussed in sec .",
    "the paper ends up with conclusions ( sec .",
    "we use a ntb model with four valence electrons per carbon atom to calculate the electronic dispersion of graphene.@xcite this model is based on matrix elements of the hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements derived from dft@xcite and therefore it does not rely on any adjustable parameters .",
    "it also allows one to estimate the total energy and the forces on the atoms .",
    "this feature is utilized for relaxation of the atomic structure .",
    "up to a few electron volts away from the fermi energy , the electronic structure of graphene has the form of conic valence and conduction bands ( dirac cones ) with a common apex ( the dirac point ) at two non - equivalent special points , k and k@xmath4 , of the brillouin zone .",
    "this specific form of the electronic bands plays an important role in the enhancement of the two - phonon raman scattering through the dr mechanism .",
    "the dynamical model of graphene uses a dynamical matrix derived by a perturbative approach within the ntb model.@xcite the electron - photon and electron - phonon matrix elements are calculated explicitly.@xcite the summation over the brillouin zone in the first - order perturbation term of the dynamical matrix is performed over a @xmath5 mesh of @xmath6 points , for which the phonon frequencies converge within @xmath7 @xmath8 . the calculated in - plane phonon branches of graphene , after scaling by a factor of @xmath9 , agree fairly well with the available experimental data@xcite ( fig .",
    "the phonons with displacement in the graphene plane ( in - plane phonons ) can interact with electrons and thus can contribute to the raman spectra .",
    "those with atomic displacement perpendicular to graphene ( out - of - plane phonons ) are less well reproduced but they do not contribute to the spectra .    it will be shown below that only phonons , close to the high - symmetry directions @xmath10k , @xmath10 m , and km of the brillouin zone , are of major importance for the two - phonon spectra .",
    "the phonon branches along these directions will be denoted , as usual , by two - letter acronyms describing their vibrational pattern : the letters o and a stand for `` optical '' and `` acoustic '' , respectively ; the letters l , t , and z denote in - plane longitudinal , in - plane transverse , and out - of - plane atomic displacement , respectively .",
    "the acronyms for the branches along the km direction will be primed .",
    "alternatively , for each wavevector , the phonons with be ascribed the index @xmath11 , @xmath12 , in order of increasing frequency .",
    "the phonons with a certain @xmath11 can belong to branches with a different vibrational pattern .",
    "for example , a phonon with @xmath13 can belong to the lo or to branch .",
    "it will also be argued that only phonons close to the @xmath10 and k points give a significant contribution to the two - phonon raman spectra .",
    "such phonons will be denoted by acronyms ending with @@xmath10 and @k .",

    "the summation over the final states runs over all phonon branches and phonon wavevectors @xmath29 . for both summations",
    ", convergence is reached with a @xmath30 mesh of @xmath6 and @xmath29 points in the brillouin zone .    for the discussion of the polarization dependence of the raman intensity of the two - phonon bands , it is advantageous to rewrite eq .",

    "we consider only backscattering geometry in accord with the usual experimental raman setup for graphene and , therefore , the polarization vectors lie in the graphene plane .",
    "the electronic linewidth @xmath27 is due to a large extent to scattering of the electrons ( holes ) by phonons and other electrons ( holes ) .",
    "the majority of the published reports assume that @xmath27 is energy - independent .",

    "4 ( bottom ) .",
    "it has two intense bands ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and three weaker ones ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) and a much weaker one ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "there are also other bands of in - plane phonons close to the @xmath10 and k points but they are either very weak , or are in the shoulders of intense bands , and in both cases are practically unobservable",
    ".    the assignment of the overtone spectrum can be performed by analyzing the contribution of phonons with different @xmath11 and from different parts of the brillouin zone of graphene .",
    "first , the contributions of the phonons with @xmath48 are given in fig .",
    "4 ( top five graphs ) .",
    "the bands in these spectra originate from pairs of phonons ta@@xmath10",

    "1 ) . the contributions for @xmath53 are by about three orders of magnitude larger than the remaining ones .",
    "secondly , the assignment of the raman bands to definite phonons at the @xmath10 and k points is supported by the analysis of the contributions to the spectra from different parts of the brillouin zone for parallel light polarization with averaging over all orientations in the graphene plane . in fig .",
    "5 , the regions with major contribution to the bands are given by shaded areas .",
    "in particular , the @xmath44 band comes from phonons ta@@xmath10 along the @xmath10k direction , the @xmath45 band - from phonons la@@xmath10 along @xmath10 m , the @xmath46 band - from phonons la@k along @xmath10k ( not shown in fig .",
    "5 ) , and the @xmath43 band - from phonons lo@@xmath10 from all directions in the brillouin zone .",
    "the @xmath42 band originates from phonons to@k and to@xmath4@k , which contribute to the integrated raman intensity of this band in ratio @xmath54 .",
    "it has long been accepted that the dominant contribution to the @xmath42 band comes from phonons along the km direction and that the contribution along the @xmath10k direction vanishes because of interference.@xcite our graphs in fig . 4 and 5 for @xmath53",
    "confirm the recent conclusion that the main contribution to this band comes from the @xmath10k direction and only a small part comes from the km direction.@xcite we also confirm the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , that among the eight dr processes , those with scattering of an electron and a hole have dominant contribution to the bands .",
    "the overtone bands are dispersive , i.e. , their raman shift depends on the laser energy ( fig .",
    "the shift increases ( decreases ) due to increase ( decrease ) of the phonon frequency away from the @xmath10 and k points .",
    "it is approximately linear in @xmath21 with slopes of @xmath55 for the @xmath43 band , @xmath56 @xmath8/ev ( @xmath42 band ) , @xmath57 @xmath8/ev ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath58 @xmath8/ev ( @xmath45 ) , and @xmath59 @xmath8/ev ( @xmath44 ) at @xmath41 ev .",
    "the slope of the @xmath42 band corresponds to the experimental one of @xmath60 @xmath8/ev ( ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] ) .    the integrated raman intensity of the overtone bands ( fig .",
    "7 ) is quasi - linear in @xmath21 except for the @xmath44 band . the ratio of the integrated intensities @xmath61 has been discussed a lot in the literature because it is related to the electron - phonon matrix elements at the k and @xmath10 points . here , we find that this ratio depends on the energy : it varies from @xmath62 for @xmath63 ev to @xmath64 for @xmath65 ev ; for @xmath66 ev it is equal to @xmath67 .",
    "by contrast , recent sophisticated dft - gw calculations@xcite yield @xmath68 , which is several times larger than our value .",
    "the reason for this disagreement can be found in the use of gw corrected electron - phonon matrix elements for the lo phonon at the @xmath10 point and the to phonon at the k point . while the ratio of the squares of these matrix elements at the two points derived by dft is @xmath69 , the dft - gw result is @xmath70 ( ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] ) .",
    "since the raman intensity depends on the square of this ratio , the dft - gw gives an intensity ratio that is larger than the dft one by a factor of @xmath71 .",
    "our result , corrected by the same correction factor , is @xmath72 .",
    "both theoretical results underestimate the experimental values of @xmath73 ( ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] ) and @xmath74 ( ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] ) by @xmath75 .",
    "the origin of this underestimation is still unknown .",
    "the combination raman spectrum is calculated for @xmath41 ev and parallel light polarization along a zigzag line of carbon bonds ( fig .",
    "8 , bottom ) .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by two intense bands : @xmath76 and a higher frequency one , which originate from the branches @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "there are also four other less intense bands : @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "as above , the assignment is facilitated by considering the contributions to these bands from pairs of phonons with @xmath82 .",
    "it is seen in fig . 8 ( top six graphs ) that for each pair @xmath83 there is a single band .",
    "these bands are due to pairs of phonons tota@k",

    "1 ) . unlike the case of the overtone bands ,",
    "the intensity of the various combination bands varies only by one order of magnitude .",
    "the band @xmath76 is mainly due to phonons tola@k with a small contribution of phonons to@xmath4lo@xmath4@k",
    ". the phonons to@xmath4la@xmath4@k give rise to an intense band at @xmath88 @xmath8 .",
    "the large contribution of the phonons to@xmath4lo@xmath4@k and to@xmath4la@xmath4@k is consistent with the large electron - phonon matrix element for the phonon to@xmath4@k and the nonzero matrix element for the phonons la@xmath4@k and lo@xmath4@k .",
    "we note that the latter contrubite to the overtone spectra as well but their bands are masked in the shoulder of the intense @xmath42 band .",
    "the band at @xmath89 @xmath8 also overlaps considerably with the much more intense @xmath42 band and can not be observed as a separate feature .",
    "thus , the total raman spectrum exhibits the intense @xmath42 band , the two weak bands @xmath43 and @xmath76(fig .",
    "9 ) , as well as the two very weak bands @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    similarly to the overtone bands , the combination bands are dispersive . the dependence of the raman shift on the laser energy ( fig .",
    "10 ) is almost linear with a slope of @xmath90 @xmath8/ev for the highest - frequency band , @xmath91 @xmath8/ev ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath92 @xmath8/ev ( @xmath81 ) , @xmath93 @xmath8/ev ( @xmath80 ) , and @xmath94 @xmath8/ev ( @xmath79 ) at @xmath41 ev .",
    "each slope is equal approximately to the sum of half of the slopes of the corresponding overtone bands .",
    "the calculated energy dependence of the @xmath76 band frequency reproduces fairly well the experimental data but the derived slope is almost three times larger than the experimental one of @xmath95 @xmath8/ev for energies between @xmath96 and @xmath97 ev ( ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] ) .",
    "the calculated frequencies for the @xmath80 and @xmath79 bands underestimate the raman data up to @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath8 , respectively .",

    "introducing the dft - gw correction factor for the electron - phonon matrix element of the to phonon at the k point of @xmath103 ( ref .",

    "we found that , for any of the two - phonon peaks discussed above , the calculated ratio of the integrated intensities , @xmath110 and @xmath107 , for variable and constant linewidth , respectively , can be fitted very well with the expression @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , @xmath110 can be written as @xmath112 , where @xmath19 depends on @xmath21 and does not depend on @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "7 and 11 that the rate of change of @xmath19 as a function of @xmath21 is different for the different two - phonon bands .",
