    "the jarzynski equality @xcite @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are a free - energy difference and a performed work respectively , plays a role of a bridge between the symmetry of microscopic dynamics as given by the fluctuation theorem @xcite and the fundamental limitation on time evolution of macroscopic quantities , which is described as the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the brackets @xmath3 denote the average over all the realizations during the dynamics starting from the initial equilibrium state .",
    "the fluctuation theorem implies that the microscopic stochastic dynamics satisfies the following symmetry .",
    "@xmath4e^{\\beta q\\left[\\lambda,\\gamma\\right]}=p\\left[\\hat{\\lambda},\\hat{\\gamma}|x_{t}\\right],\\label{ppq}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denote an external protocol , a microscopic time evolution of the system with the initial condition @xmath7 , and a heat flow from the surrounding heat bath to the system , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath8 stands for the time - reversal operation .",
    "we usually term the jarzynski equality as generalization of the second law of thermodynamics since the jarzynski equality yields @xmath9 by use of jensen s inequality .",
    "although the present study does not aim at giving any objection against the validity of the jarzynski equality , we would like to ask the following fundamental question on the above ordinary understanding of the relationship between the jarzynski equality and the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "does @xmath10 express the performed work in thermodynamics ?",
    "the reasons for asking this question are as follows .",
    "let us go back to a starting point of statistical mechanics and its connection with thermodynamics . to elucidate macroscopic properties from a microscopic description of the system",
    ", we consider an infinite - number limit of the sample mean , which is a coarse - grained picture of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "the performed work given in the jarzynski equality @xmath10 has not been baptized yet through this ordinary procedure . within a framework of the large deviation theory @xcite , which underlies statistical mechanics , the observed physical quantity in the thermodynamics is characterized by a global minimum of the rate function . the performed work used in the jarzynski equality",
    "is not yet confirmed to be expressed by the global minimum of the rate function .",
    "in addition , the rate function can possess not only the global minimum but also several local minima , which represent existence of so - called metastable ( quasi - stationary ) states .",
    "the system with metastable states does not always relax toward equilibrium state within a moderate time scale in a practical experiment . from the above considerations",
    ", we can not readily regard the performed work @xmath10 in methods with the jarzynski equality as that in thermodynamics .",
    "this problem motivates us to compute the performed work in thermodynamics by directly evaluating the dynamics for the coarse - grained quantity , which can be described by stochastic evolution of the density field ( probability measure valued process @xcite ) .",
    "we analyze the stochastic evolution of the density field by employing the following strategy . at first",
    ", we evaluate the entropy production of the system from the action functional @xcite , which is the rate function for the stochastic evolution of the density field and describes contributions around the most probable path of time evolution of the density fields . as one of our main results in the present study , the second law of thermodynamics can be rederived from the symmetry of this action functional , which is generated from the fluctuation theorem .",
    "this formalism is the baptized way toward thermodynamics by use of the rate function , which is different from the ordinary one through the jarzynski equality as in the literatures @xcite .",
    "these analyses provide deep understanding of the connection between the fluctuation theorem and the second law of thermodynamics and bring us another nontrivial result , which is relevant for macroscopic behavior in a system with metastable states .",
    "the further analysis of the action functional leads the form of the rate function for the metastable states , which enables us to establish a nontrivial nonequilibrium work relation for metastable states .",
    "this work relation can be expressed in the same form as the jarzynski equality in the special condition related to relaxation processes toward the preselected metastable state denoted by an index @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of degrees of freedom in the system we deal with , @xmath14 is the performed work per degree of freedom through the external protocol characterized by @xmath15 .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is the free energy per degree of freedom for the last equilibrium state at @xmath17 , while @xmath18 is that for the initial metastable state identified by an index @xmath11 among several metastable states at @xmath19 . by use of our nonequilibrium work relation ( [ je_meta ] ) , we can compute the free energy for the metastable state due to the same form as the jarzynski equality . the existence of metastable states is considered to be related to peculiar relaxation dynamics as in the glassy systems .",
    "our result would provide a significant insight for the understanding of the special behavior observed in such complicated systems .",
    "we organize the present paper as follows . before going to the detailed analysis",
    ", we explain our motivation in the present study in more detail by showing a gap of understanding on the fluctuation theorem from the description of the thermodynamic system . in the following section",
    ", we demonstrate the detailed analysis on the action functional , which characterizes the rate function for the stochastic evolution of the density field .",
    "the description of the second law of thermodynamics , by our presentation , is shown in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we assess the jarzynski equality for the system with metastable states . in the last section ,",
    "we conclude our study .",
    "in order to evaluate the most probable event in the stochastic system , we often evaluate the rate function . in our study",
    ", we focus on the performed work in the thermodynamic system .",
    "the crooks fluctuation theorem @xcite shows the symmetry of the path probability for the forward process and backward process with the performed work .",
    "the jarzynski equality can be obtained from one of the consequence of the crooks fluctuation theorem .",
    "one might think that all we have to do is to consider their limit of large - number degrees of freedom as @xmath20 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite , the crooks fluctuation theorem in context of the large deviation theory is presented ) .",
    "it is however not always true .",
    "the simple limitation is validated under a specific assumption that the large deviation property holds for the path probability associated with the performed work . in other words , we assume existence of the rate function with a convex form for the performed work as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the probability for the performed work , and @xmath23 is its rate function .",
    "the assumption is quite natural but often gives rise to our misunderstanding on the correct description of the macroscopic system .",
    "for instance , the phase transition in equilibrium system can be explained in context of the rate function as its breakdown of convexity .",
    "the form of the rate function should be discussed in detail to correctly understand thermodynamic behavior .    in the present study",
    ", we analyze the rate function without assumption on its form for a mean - field model . in equilibrium statistical mechanics , the mean - field model such as the curie - weiss model plays a role to provide the essential understanding on the macroscopic behavior including the phase transition by describing various forms of the rate function of the order parameter .",
    "we show the detailed analysis of the rate function in the following section .",
    "after that , we point out possibility that a different nonequilibrium equality holds for the peculiar dynamics in the system with metastable states .",
    "let us consider that the system consists of @xmath13 degrees of freedom @xmath24 and is attached to a heat bath with an inverse temperature @xmath25 .",
    "the work is performed into the system through an external protocol @xmath15 .",
    "let us make two additional assumptions for the system in our study .",
    "first , the dynamics is governed by the diffusion process @xcite .",
    "second , the hamiltonian is written by two - body interactions with all the components ( i.e. mean field ) . under this assumption ,",

    "the hamiltonian is written by @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the potential trap , @xmath31 is the two - body interaction term and symmetric @xmath32 . in this dynamical system , we analyze stochastic evolution of the density field ( empirical measure ) @xmath33 @xcite . by employing equation ( [ eq3 ] ) and the ito formula",
    ", we evaluate the derivative of @xmath34 as @xmath35 where we use abbreviations @xmath36 and the property of the wiener process @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes kronecker delta .",
    "we substitute properties of the density field , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an arbitrary function , into equation ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "then , we obtain the stochastic evolution of the density field as @xmath41 where @xmath42 by employing equation ( [ dmu ] ) , we derive the functional fokker - planck equation as , following the ordinary procedure @xcite [ see also appendix a ] , @xmath43&=&\\displaystyle \\int dx\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\mu\\left(x\\right)}\\left\\{-d_{\\mu,\\lambda_{t}}\\left(x\\right)\\mathrm{prob}_{t}\\left[\\mu\\right]\\right\\}\\\\ & & + \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2n}\\int\\int dxdy\\frac{\\delta^{2}}{\\delta\\mu\\left(x\\right)\\delta\\mu\\left(y\\right)}\\left\\{r_{\\mu}\\left(x , y\\right)\\mathrm{prob}_{t}\\left[\\mu\\right]\\right\\},\\label{fokker - planck}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 $ ] is the probability for the density field and @xmath45 denotes a diffusion matrix of the functional fokker - planck equation ( [ fokker - planck ] ) as @xmath46    let us consider the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath47 ) on equation ( [ dmu ] ) to elucidate the macroscopic behavior of the system .",
    "we reach a nonlinear diffusion equation for the density field @xmath48 , which represents thermodynamic time evolution of the system , @xmath49    next let us consider to derive the second law of thermodynamics through the fluctuation theorem . in order to examine the fluctuation of the density field from the solution of the nonlinear diffusion equation ( [ diffusion eq ] ) in a sufficient large @xmath13",
