    "the canonical cold dark matter ( cdm ) model for the origin of structure in the universe provides a concise qualitative description of large - scale - structure data spanning several orders of magnitude in distance scales , but on closer inspection , there seem to be anomalies . for example , optical and infrared surveys seem to indicate more power on large scales relative to that on small scales ( peacock & dodds 1994 ) . a number of variations on the standard cdm model have been suggested which improve the agreement between some data and model predictions .",
    "these include ( but are not limited to ) the introduction of a cosmological constant ( efstathiou , sutherland & maddox 1990 ; kofman , gnedin & bahcall 1993 ; krauss & turner 1995 ; ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) or a lower hubble constant ( bartlett et al . 1994 ) .",
    "however , a problem with discriminating between these various models from large - scale - structure measurements is that luminous matter may be ` biased ' relative to the mass distribution ( kaiser 1984 ) and this bias is likely to evolve with time and scale ( see , for example , matarrese et al .",
    "further investigation of the bias of luminous objects is thus important in the recovery of the primordial power spectrum from large scale structure data .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the implications of new data obtained from deep radio surveys : in particular , the vla _ first _ ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ) survey ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ; white et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the goal of _ first _ is to survey the 10,000 @xmath0 scheduled for inclusion in the sloan digital sky survey down to a flux - density threshold of 1 mjy . at present",
    ", the survey covers almost 3,000 @xmath0 of sky where @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath2 @xmath6 @xmath2 @xmath7 .",
    "this yields a catalog of @xmath8 sources , about one third of which are in double - lobed and multi - component sources .",
    "the survey has been shown to be 95% complete down to 2 mjy and 80% complete to 1 mjy .",
    "the mean redshift of the radio sources in the survey is at @xmath9 , as opposed to redshifts @xmath10 characteristic of sources in optical or infrared surveys , so the typical physical distances for fixed angular separations are larger .",
    "therefore , clustering of _ first _ radio sources has the potential to probe the power spectrum on large scales and at earlier epochs .    the first high - significance detection of an angular correlation function for radio sources was presented in cress et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . using the cf - estimator proposed by landy and szalay ( 1993 ) on the first 1550 @xmath0 of the survey",
    ", it was found that the correlation function between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is well - fit by a power law of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "results using a simpler estimator were also presented but when the survey was later expanded to include a new @xmath16 it became evident that the ls estimator was the more robust ( cress et al .",
    "correlation - function measurements shown here are determined using the ls estimator in the expanded survey area .",
    "the purpose of the work presented here is to develop the formalism required to interpret , within a cdm framework , angular - correlation - function measurements of deep surveys and to apply this to the observational results of cress et al .",
    "we also discuss applications to measurements made from other radio surveys .",
    "we restrict our investigation to spatially - flat models ( allowing for the possibility of a non - zero @xmath17 ) . given a power spectrum , calculation of the angular correlation function is straightforward and similar to that for optical or infrared surveys .",
    "however , there are two important issues which we address here .",
    "( 1 ) we investigate the uncertainties in the predictions which arise from imprecise knowledge of the survey redshift distribution .",
    "( 2 ) since the typical redshifts of sources in the _ first _ survey are of order unity , the evolution of the power spectrum must be considered in the analysis or else there may be errors of order unity in the deduced primordial power spectrum . we include estimates of the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in  2 , we discuss the redshift distribution inferred for the sample . in  3 , we discuss the time evolution of the power spectrum , and in  4 , we discuss the calculation of the angular correlation function .",
    "results are presented and discussed in  5 .",
    "we make some concluding remarks in  6 .",
    "we use redshift - distribution estimates derived from two sources : ( i ) the 1.4-ghz radio luminosity function ( rlf ) presented by condon ( 1984 ) and ( ii ) a set of 2.7-ghz lf estimates presented by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) .    in estimating the rlf , condon used faint radio sources with optical counterparts in the ugc catalog to determine a @xmath18 rlf for spiral galaxies .",
    "he combined this with auriemma s ( 1977 ) estimate of the local rlf for elliptical galaxies and then found a model for the rlf at higher redshifts by allowing the local population to have evolved in density and luminosty .",
    "the functions of redshift that describe the evolution were constrained using number counts ( down to sub - mjy thresholds ) at 1.4ghz and at other frequencies , spectral - index measurements and redshift measurements for a few very bright sources .",
    "dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) ( dp ) estimated the 2.7-ghz rlfs of steep- and flat - spectrum sources separately using similar constraints as those used by condon as well as some new data which included redshifts estimated from k - band photometry . to demonstrate the possible errors in the rlfs resulting from these imprecise redshift estimates , they analyze two distributions : one where assigned redshifts are the mean values for galaxies of a given k - band luminosity ( mean-@xmath19 distribution ) and one ( the high-@xmath19 distribution ) where redshifts are larger than the average ( they give reasons why one might expect this kind of bias ) .",
    "seven models were presented and parameters for all seven models were determined for both mean- and high-@xmath19 distributions .    here , we obtain the redshift distribution of _ first _",
    "sources by integrating the rlf s over all luminosities that produce flux - densities greater than 1mjy .",
    "the dp models were first shifted to 1.4ghz assuming a spectral index of @xmath20 for steep - spectrum sources and a spectral index of @xmath21 for flat - spectrum sources ( where the luminosity is related to the frequency by l@xmath22 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the redshift distribution @xmath23 for condon s lf and for a selection of the models given in dp for a flux - density limit of 1 mjy .",
    "mean- and high-@xmath19 distributions produce similar results and the differences between dp s models 1 through 5 are smaller than the differences shown in the figure . in condon s model , the sharp increase in the number of sources near @xmath24 is due to starbursting galaxies . for larger flux - density limits ,",
    "this low-@xmath19 peak is reduced considerably , and we have checked that our redshift distributions for larger flux - density limits agree with those shown in fig .",

    "in cdm models , one starts with a scale - free primordial power spectrum , @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the comoving wavenumber ) .",
    "this @xmath27 is then ` processed ' according a transfer function for cdm . at the epoch at which structure begins to grow , @xmath28 where @xmath29 for cdm is given by bond & efstathiou ( 1984 ) and @xmath30 is the normalisation .",
    "we normalise to _ cobe _ 4-year data using liddle et al.s ( 1996 ) formula which is valid for spatially - flat models .",
    "we will refer to this @xmath31 spectrum as the primordial power spectrum .    in the linear regime",

    "we have plotted @xmath68 , the redshift distribution of the clustering signal , for a range of angles ( @xmath69 universe ) .",
    "one sees that the larger - angle cf estimates are dominated by contributions from nearby objects and even at @xmath70 one expects about half the signal to come from objects with @xmath71 .",
    "this illustrates that the angular correlation function probes clustering at redshifts significantly smaller than those characteristic of the survey population .",
    "more quantitatively , the models used here predict that the mean redshift probed by the correlation function at @xmath72 ( @xmath70,@xmath73 ) is expected to be @xmath74=0.4 ( 0.18 , 0.08 ) .",
    "together , figures 2 and 3 highlight the fact that the cf measured for _ first _ is likely to be rather sensitive to smallish - scale correlations in fairly nearby sources .",
    "figure 4 shows how the predictions for @xmath43 vary for different estimates of the redshift distribution and how they change when nonlinear evolution is considered .",

    "it should be noted , however , that condon s luminosity function is more carefully constructed to fit the low-@xmath19 population and it was pointed out above that these sources are expected to make large contributions to the clustering signal . in addition , peacock has indicated that dp s model 7 is the best model to use ( the difference between ` high-@xmath19 ' model 7 as opposed to ` medium-@xmath19 ' model 7 is not significant ) . if one limits oneself to dp7 and condon s model then uncertainties in the redshift distribution do not contribute very significantly to uncertainties in the correlation - function predictions .    for the @xmath69 model shown in figure 4 ,",
    "it is clear that the effect of nonlinear evolution is significant on scales less than @xmath75 . for a @xmath17-dominated model",
    "the nonlinear contributions are significant out to scales of @xmath76",
    ". the precise scale at which nonlinearities become important also depends on the redshift distribution .",

    "the dashed lines show results for @xmath80 and @xmath79 taking values 0.5 and 0.65 .",
    "error bars in the plot are determined using a ` partition bootstrap method ' in which the cf is calculated for 10 subdivisions of the survey region and the standard deviation of these measurements at each angle is used as a measure of the error .",

    "( 1996 ) . at a first glance",
    "it would appear that the data is best fit by an @xmath64 model with a high hubble constant , but this is misleading .",
    "it is likely that at low fluxes , a significant fraction of the source counts come from fairly nearby `` star - bursting '' spiral galaxies as opposed to the agn - powered sources that one normally associates with radio sources ( condon 1984 ) . since spiral galaxies have been shown to have different clustering properties from ellipticals ( see , for example , hermit et al .",
    "1996 ) and from agn in general ( for an estimate of the quasar correlation function see boyle et al .",
    "1993 ) , it seems likely that the correlation function measured here will have contributions from populations with different clustering properties . in ",
    "3 we showed that on large angular scales ( @xmath83 ) , we expect the signal to be dominated by fairly local sources and so it is probably more reflective of the `` starburst '' clustering . on small angular scales we are probably more sensitive to the clustering of more distant agn . with this in mind",
    ", we do not attach special significance to the curve which best matches the slope of the data .",
    "instead , we calculate the bias @xmath84 , separately on small and large scales ( where @xmath85 ) and use this as an indicator of the relative bias of different populations in the survey . inferred biases for various cosmological models are shown in table 1 .",
    "estimates of the bias calculated when the power spectrum is normalized to the observed cluster abundance are shown in brackets .",
    "these were estimated by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is given by bunn & white ( 1997 ) and @xmath88 for @xmath89 ( viana & liddle 1996 ; white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 also shows the value of @xmath90 calculated for various models assuming that the spatial correlation function of sources is approximated by a power law and that density fluctuations evolve linearly ; i.e. @xmath91 ( in comoving coordinates ) .",
    "we used @xmath92 for the _ first _ measurement and @xmath93 for the other surveys but the @xmath90 results do not depend heavily on the chosen value of @xmath94 .",
    "peacock & nicholson ( pn , 1991 ) measured the spatial correlation function for bright ( @xmath95 ) radio galaxies with redshifts between 0.01 and 0.1 and found it to be well fit by @xmath96 mpc and @xmath93 .",
    "after correcting for redshift - space distortions , one would most likely obtain a real - space @xmath90 slightly less than this .",
    "this result indicates that bright radio galaxies trace the matter distribution in a way similar to low - richness abell clusters . assuming linear evolution , estimates for @xmath90 in the _ first _ sample range from @xmath97 to @xmath98 depending on what redshift distribution is used .",
    "note that in cress et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the @xmath90 obtained was based on a different estimate of the angular correlation function .",
    "the value obtained here is consistent with the fainter sources in the sample being less clustered than the bright sources investigated by pn .",
    "this picture is supported by ledlow & owen s ( 1995 ) observation that in a sensitive radio survey , field ellipticals and cluster ellipticals have a similar probability of being detected . one might thus expect sources to be clustered more like ellipticals than like clusters .",
    "another consistency check is supplied by the measurement of the angular cross - correlation of abell clusters and _ first _ sources presented in cress et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . using this result in a cross - correlation analog of limber s equation ( see seldner & peebles 1978 ) , we inferred the amplitude of the spatial cross - correlation of abell clusters and _ first _ sources .",
    "dp s model 7 was used for the redshift distribution of _ first _ sources and the distribution of abell clusters was obtained by fitting a function of the form @xmath99 to data given in huchra et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . by combining the autocorrelation and the cross - correlation we found the ratio of cluster bias to radio - source bias ( @xmath100 ) to be about 1.9 .",
    "a similar estimate of @xmath100 was also obtained by combining the measured cluster - cluster spatial correlation and the radio - radio spatial correlation function inferred above .",
    "mo , peacock & xia ( 1993 ) compared bright radio galaxies with abell clusters and obtained a value of 1.7 for this ratio .",
    "this is also consistent with the idea that the faint sources in _ first _ are somewhat less clustered than the bright sources investigated by their work ( same as in pn ) .",
    "= 85truemm    angular correlation functions of radio sources have also been measured for the green bank and the parkes - mit - nrao ( pmn ) surveys done at 4.85 ghz ( loan , wall & lahav 1997 ; kooiman et al .",
    "1995 ; sicotte 1995 ) and for wenss  the 325-mhz westerbork northern sky survey ( rengelink et al .",
    "we have investigated cdm predictions for these surveys using dp7 to estimate the redshift distribution of sources with @xmath101 mjy in the gb / pmn surveys and of sources with @xmath102 mjy in wenss . predicted correlation functions ( assuming no bias ) are shown in figure 6 .",
    "taking @xmath103=0.0025 , @xmath104 and @xmath93 [ where @xmath105 , we have calculated the bias of sources in these surveys relative to cdm predictions and listed them in table 1 . the source composition in these two surveys is probably more similar to the sample investigated by pn , although wenss is likely to include fewer quasars .",
    "the biases inferred for the pn sample are also shown in the table .    while a large amount of variation in inferred clustering strength could be attributed to uncertainties in the correlation - function estimates and to the different clustering of different populations , data summarized in table 1 show some indication that as one probes deeper , the inferred bias increases . assuming that _ first _",
    "( at small angles ) and the other surveys probe a similar population of objects , we have , with cluster normalization , @xmath106 at @xmath107 for the standard model and @xmath108 at @xmath109 .",
    "one interpretation of this is that the clustering is evolving slower than cdm models predict",
    ". however , matarrese et al . (",
    "1996 ) , drawing on work by mo & white ( 1996 ) and by fry ( 1996 ) , have recently argued that in cdm models , the bias of a given population _ should _ decrease with time ; that is , the fluctuations in density inferred from luminous objects should tend towards the real fluctuations in the mass density as time goes by .",
    "thus , the observations in table 1 could still be consistent with cdm predictions if bias evolution takes place .",
    "interestingly enough , this apparent bias evolution is stronger than that seen in optical surveys ( matarrese et al .",
    "this would be consistent with the general picture that the bias evolution for objects which tend to form at higher - density mass peaks is stronger .",
    "if one writes @xmath110 , the value of @xmath111 which best fits the data is @xmath112 but this can vary significantly when uncertainties in the measurements are considered .",
    "we have studied the implications of angular clustering of radio sources in deep surveys for standard - cdm  like models for structure formation . we have examined the effect of uncertainties in the redshift distribution and considered nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum .",
    "we have also studied what may be learned about the biasing of such sources and the evolution of such a bias .",
    "we have shown that uncertainties in the redshift distribution of _ first _ sources can contribute a significant amount to the uncertainties in the cdm predictions of the angular correlation function even when bias is not considered . however , limiting oneself to condon s model and dp7 reduces the uncertainties significantly .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that the uncertainty in the predicted angular correlation function which arise from uncertainties in the redshift distribution are still not much larger than the statistical uncertainty in the measured angular correlation function .",
    "therefore , uncertainties in the redshift distribution do not currently affect strongly the implications of radio - source clustering for the origin of structure .",
    "the effect of nonlinear evolution on the predictions has also been explored .",
    "it appears that nonlinear contributions become important on scales of @xmath113 to @xmath76 depending on what model is used .",
    "therefore , as data improve , the standard approximation of a power - law evolution of the clustering with redshift will break down .",
    "we also found that although the mean redshift of sources in deep radio surveys may be of order unity , the clustering signal comes primarily from smaller redshifts .",
    "that is , the angular correlation function is more sensitive to nearby clustering than one might expect from the @xmath23 distribution . furthermore , the redshift distribution of the clustering signal varies significantly with the angular scale probed .",
    "therefore , the angular correlation function reflects the evolution of the three - dimensional power spectrum as well as the power spectrum at some fixed epoch .    we have shown that spatially - flat cdm models can produce angular correlation functions similar to those observed in the _ first _ survey as long as some kind of biasing is invoked .",
    "the needed biasing seems to be a bit larger than that needed for optical sources , but less than that needed for brighter radio sources .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that _ first _ sources are a heterogeneous sample which contain numerous nearby starbursting galaxies as well as more distant brighter radio sources .",
    "we have also begun to explore what may be learned about the evolution of bias from the _ first _ and other radio surveys . at this stage , it is difficult to make very quantitative statements about the evolution of clustering because the cf measurements that probe higher-@xmath19 ranges have large uncertainties associated with them .",
    "in addition , bias evolution will have to be understood better if we are to learn about the evolution of mass clustering .",
    "this point is particularly significant for a heterogeneous sample of objects such as _ first _ sources .",
    "one way to improve our ability to make quantitative statements about clustering evolution is to make more precise measurements of the clustering of sources that probe the higher-@xmath19 range . as the _ first _ survey coverage increases",
    ", we will be able to obtain significant clustering signals for samples with higher flux thresholds .",
    "increasing the flux threshold should increase the average redshift probed by the correlation function and thus improves one s chances of probing larger scales .",
    "another way of increasing the redshift probed by the cf might be to remove all sources that have optical counterparts in the apm survey .",
    "this is currently being investigated .",
    "improving our estimates of the redshift distribution of faint sources is also important and there is some hope that this will be done in the near future .",
