    "the discovery of a large population of bright sources at high redshift through the opening of the submillimetre ( submm ) and millimetre ( mm ) wavelength windows ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) continues to have a profound impact on our understanding of galaxy evolution in the early universe .",
    "these submm / mm - selected galaxies ( hereafter smgs ) are characterized by large far - infrared ( fir ) luminosities ( @xmath4 l@xmath5 ) , tremendous star formation rates ( sfrs , @xmath6 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 ) , large gas reservoirs ( @xmath8 m@xmath5 ) , and a number density that is high compared to local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .    due to the steep rise with frequency of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this population of galaxies on the rayleigh ",

    "this effect represents a unique opportunity for an unbiased view of star formation over a wide redshift range back to the earlier epochs of structure formation .",

    "in this section we simulate maps with properties similar to those from which the published redshift distributions have been derived in order to understand the selection effects ( i.e. wavelength of observations , angular resolution and depth of the maps ) .",
    "we use an a priori redshift distribution and compare the a posteriori redshift distribution recovered from each simulated map .",
    "we adopt the source counts at 1.1 mm from @xcite derived from 1.6 deg@xmath66 blank - field surveys with aztec , and the redshift distribution measured by @xcite for 78 smgs detected with aztec at 1.1 mm in the goods fields ( see section [ zdists ] ) .",
    "we decide to use these priors because 1.1 mm is the central wavelength of surveys considered ( @xmath67m@xmath68 mm ) , and hence it has a better overlap with the population of galaxies detected at other wavelengths . although there are galaxies detected at other wavelengths that are not detected at 1.1 mm , the conclusion of this paper that the 1.1 mm distribution gives a good approximation to the median of a common parent distribution does not change , for the range considered in this paper ( @xmath67m@xmath68 mm ) .",

    "we co - add this signal map with a noise map where the noise is represented by a gaussian with a mean of zero mjy / beam and a standard deviation equal to the @xmath75 depth of each survey described in section 2 . in the case of the sample of @xcite , where the galaxies have been selected from two different surveys ,",
    "we have adopted the mean depth of both surveys . on the other hand , in the case of @xcite , where the sample consists of lensed galaxies , we have adopted a noise ( @xmath76 mjy ) such that the galaxies detected ( s / n@xmath36 ) in our simulated map have a flux density similar to the mean delensed ( intrinsic ) flux density estimated by @xcite .",
    "finally , in the case of @xcite , we have simulated a noise map in which the noise increases radially from @xmath54 mjy / beam to @xmath77 mjy / beam on the edges , similar to the noise properties in the daisy maps of s2cls .",
    "the remaining surveys are quite uniform and do not need a special treatment of their noise properties .",
    "finally , we convolve this co - added map with a gaussian point spread function ( psf ) with a full width at half  maximum ( fwhm ) equal to the angular resolution of the different surveys we want to simulate . in fig .",

    ", we simulate seven maps of 400 sq .",
    "arcmin that reproduce the wavelength , depth , and angular resolution of the surveys that we wish to analyse .",
    "the size of the maps allows us enough statistics in each realization .",
    "once we have all the simulated maps , the next step is to extract the sources and to calculate the redshift distribution of each map .",
    "a source is considered to be recovered in each map if it is detected with s / n @xmath78 within a search radius equal to the fwhm of the beam , where @xmath79 is the value used in each of the surveys described in section 2 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "we conduct 100 realizations to estimate the redshift distribution extracted for each map , the median value , and the error on the median calculated as the standard deviation of the median values in each realization .",
    "although we have only one a priori redshift distribution , the extracted redshift distributions from the simulated maps have different shapes ( see fig . [ histogramas ] ) .",
    "the median redshift varies increasingly from @xmath81 to @xmath82 as the wavelength of the simulated maps changes from 450 @xmath1 m to 2 mm respectively .",
    "this result does not depend on whether we assume that the temperature of smgs follows the same gaussian distribution for all sources or the temperature - luminosity relationship .",
    "we will call this set of redshift distributions , hereafter , the _ expected _ redshift distributions , since these are the distributions we expect to measure after taking into account selection effects .",
    "we will compare these expected redshift distributions with the published distributions .",

    "this means that we are missing some high - redshift galaxies from the original parent distribution ( @xmath33 ; @xcite ) through selection effects and for this reason the median is shifted towards lower redshifts .",
    "@xcite estimated a redshift distribution with @xmath86 , whilst we have derived from the simulated map a distribution with @xmath87 which is compatible within the error bars with the published value .",
    "@xcite proposed a corrected model for their distribution that takes into account the expected radio bias , and suggested a revised @xmath88 , in better agreement with our extracted distribution .",
    "hence the redshift distribution of @xcite is also consistent with our a priori redshift distribution .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath89 from their 870 @xmath1m  survey . a statistical analysis of the unidentified sources , however , shifts the distribution to @xmath90 in very good agreement with our expected @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , a recent study of the same submillimetre source sample with alma , which ensures the photometric redshift of the correct counterparts are used ( @xcite ) finds the same result with a @xmath92 after correcting for incompleteness .",
    "@xcite reported a median redshift of @xmath63 at a wavelength of 2 mm , in very good agreement with the value that we have extracted from our simulated map ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the @xcite distribution is obviously in agreement with our expected distribution , since it is the one we have adopted as the a priori distribution .",
    "this confirms that our simulations and the source extraction method are working correctly , since we are recovering the same distribution at this wavelength .    the photometric redshift distribution of , who found a median redshift of @xmath94 for 17 galaxies detected at 1.1 mm in the cosmos field , is also within the 68% confidence level bars of our value , but there is an offset from the @xcite distribution .",
    "the offset could be due in part to cosmic variance , where the cosmos field is known to have several notable , very distant @xmath95 galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) as discussed by @xcite .",
    "however , there are two distributions which at first are not compatible with our expected redshift distribution for these surveys ; these are as follows :    \\a ) the @xcite redshift distribution , derived from their deep 450 @xmath1m  map , has a median of @xmath3 , which is in disagreement with our expected distribution ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "it is important to remark the differences between the @xcite and the @xcite ( @xmath55 ) redshift distributions because they were extracted from surveys at the same wavelength and angular resolution , but , they peak at different redshifts . this offset is likely due to the difference in depths between both surveys as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the work by @xcite is a factor of @xmath97 deeper and therefore they were able to detect fainter galaxies at lower redshift . in conclusion , in order to explain the @xcite distribution we would need to consider another population of galaxies which lie at lower redshifts and probably with different luminosities and sfrs ( i.e. luminous infrared galaxies , lirgs ) than longer  wavelength selected smgs .",
    "the properties that this population of galaxies should have in order to reproduce the redshift distribution are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "\\b ) the @xcite redshift distribution is also in disagreement with our expected distribution , since our median redshift is @xmath98 .",
    "however , as @xcite noted , their selection of bright 1.4 mm sources imposes a requirement that they be gravitationally lensed , effectively suppressing sources at @xmath99 due to the low probability of being lensed at these redshifts . since our a priori redshift distribution has a significant proportion of sources with @xmath99 ( @xmath100 , and @xmath101 with @xmath102 , where the effect is still significant ) we do not expect to have compatible distributions . in order to analyse the lensing bias ,",
    "we have removed the low - redshift sources from our extracted redshift distribution according to the probability of strong lensing as a function of redshift . in order to estimate this probability",
    ", we used a mean source magnification of @xmath103 ( the sample has magnifications of @xmath104 ) and normalized the lensing probability estimated by @xcite for this magnification , at @xmath105 , where the probability becomes flat .",
    "once we have removed the low - redshift sources due to the strong lensing effect , the extracted redshift distribution has a median redshift of @xmath106 , which is in agreement within the error bars with the derived @xmath107 .",
    "we have estimated the error in the @xcite median redshift using a bootstrapping method , and taking all ambiguous sources to be at their lowest redshift solution .",
    "@xcite also reached the same conclusion when comparing their 850@xmath1m  selected redshift distribution and the lensing  corrected 1.4mm  selected redshift distribution .",
    "aditionally , the galaxies observed by @xcite could be intrinsically brighter than the average smgs and therefore could lie at higher redshifts as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we have thus shown that the measured distributions are mostly consistent with a parent distribution with @xmath33 , very similar to the redshift distribution of @xcite when taking into account wavelength selection , depth , and angular resolution limitations .",
    "we should stress that we are not considering the difficulties intrinsic to finding multiwavelength counterparts for these sources , or obtaining spectroscopic redshift which could bias the measured redshift distributions observationally .",
    "these biases are hence intrinsic to this study and to the adopted prior .    on the other hand ,",
    "we are also interested in determining which of these parameters is the most crucial factor in imposing differences on the measured redshift distributions . in order to quantify this ,",
    "we have followed the same procedure as described in section 3 , but now , with an angular resolution of @xmath108 arcsec ( comparable to alma resolutions ) for all the simulated maps . with this high angular resolution",
    "the blending of sources is insignificant and therefore we are able to recover a large fraction of sources in each map .",
    "however , the redshift distribution extracted from each simulated map is very similar to the one we measured from the poorer angular resolution maps . in fig .",
    "[ almaresolution ] we show the extracted redshift distribution at 450 @xmath1 m and 1.1 mm for both , poor ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 arcsec respectively ) and best ( @xmath108 arcsec ) angular resolutions . at each wavelength , the histograms have been scaled by the total number of galaxies extracted from the map with the highest angular resolution , in order to compare them easily .",
    "m - shallow map with a resolution of @xmath111 ( solid black line ) and @xmath112 ( dashed black line ) , and from the simulated 1.1 mm - map with a resolution of @xmath111 ( solid gray line ) and @xmath113 ( dashed gray line ) .",
    "the median and the error on the median for each distribution ( square and diamond for the poorer and better angular resolution maps respectively ) are plotted at the top of the graph .",
    "the histograms have been scaled by the total number of galaxies extracted from the map with the highest angular resolution , in each wavelength.,width=340 ]    the similarity of the histograms confirms that wavelength and depth mainly determine the redshift distribution , and therefore the angular resolution is only a secondary effect in imposing a bias .",
    "this result is in agreement with the work of @xcite , who did an alma follow - up of the @xcite sample finding largely the same redshift distribution with the new high - resolution data .",
    "however , the fainter population of galaxies that has not yet been detected with single - dish telescopes ( due to the confusion limit ) could have a different redshift distribution , and therefore the angular resolution could be an important effect at these smaller flux densities .",
    "we have shown that shorter wavelength  maps miss high redshift galaxies .",
    "it is also important to understand the differences between the subsets of galaxies selected at different wavelengths .",
    "as we have the temperature and emissivity index for each recovered galaxy ( grey  body distribution , see section 3 ) we can investigate the properties of the seds of the galaxies extracted in the different simulated maps .",
    "analysing these properties , we have found that the main difference between the galaxies selected at different wavelengths is the grey  body temperature , where the shorter - wavelength maps select a hotter population .",
    "the mean sed peak wavelength monotonically shifts from @xmath114 m to @xmath115 ( or @xmath116 to @xmath117 k ) for 450 @xmath1m  selected galaxies to 2 mm  selected galaxies , respectively .",
    "there is no significant difference between the 1.1 mm , 870 @xmath1 m , and 850 @xmath1 m maps , which have a mean sed peak of @xmath118 m ( or @xmath119 k ) .",
    "this effect has been previously discussed by @xcite , where they also found that their two samples ( scuba-2 450 and 850 @xmath1m - selected galaxies in the cosmos field ) occupy a similar parameter space in redshift and luminosity , with a difference in the sed peak of @xmath120 m or a temperature difference of @xmath58 k , consistent , within the error bars , with our simulations .",
    "a common method to compare distributions is the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( k - s ) test which tells us the probability that two distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "we have applied this test to all the pairs of redshift distributions extracted from the different simulated maps . in order to compare with the results from previous studies we have chosen 70 random sources for each simulated map and then we have applied the k - s test to these subsamples .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 .    as can be seen in table 1",
    ", we can reject with better than 99 per cent confidence the hypothesis that the subsample of 450@xmath1m  selected galaxies has a common parent redshift distribution with the subsamples extracted from longer ",
    "wavelength simulated maps , even when we know that all these distributions have been generated adopting the same parent distribution .",
    "the same hypothesis for other wavelengths can not be rejected with such a high confidence . hence , if we want to know that if two distributions extracted from surveys carried out at different wavelengths are compatible with a common parent distribution , one should implement simulations similar to those described here , since the k ",

    "we have analysed the selection effects that wavelength , depth , and angular resolution impose on the extracted redshift distributions from different surveys .",
    "we have found that some of the published redshift distributions , which were reported to be inconsistent with each other , are in agreement with a common parent distribution .",
    "the differences between these published redshift distributions can be explained by selection effects imprinted mainly by differences in wavelength and depth of the observations .",
    "the median redshifts derived from our simulations ( @xmath121 ) are in very good agreement with the values previously reported ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which indicate the consistency between the published redshift distributions and our adopted parent distribution , even when some of these distributions have been shown to be statistically inconsistent with each other ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we can also reproduce with the same parent distribution the redshift distribution of @xcite which peaks at @xmath2 , when we take into account the bias imposed by the lensing probability .",
    "we conclude that in order to test compatibility of this kind of distributions , which have been extracted from surveys with different selection effects , the best way is to use simulations ( similar to the procedure described here ) .    as expected , and previously described by @xcite , the main difference between the galaxies selected at different wavelengths is the sed temperature .",
