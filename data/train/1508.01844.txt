    "* historical context : * abstract regularization methods were developed in symplectic geometry in the 1990s for the purpose of assigning a virtual fundamental cycle to moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves that can not be regularized by geometric methods . in purely topological terms , such _ regularization methods _ aim to answer the following question :    0ex _ given a surjection @xmath0 with a canonical zero section @xmath1 ( i.e.  @xmath2 ) and a designated section @xmath3 with compact zero set @xmath4 , what extra structure is needed to induce a homology class on @xmath5 that generalizes the euler class of vector bundles ? _",
    "the current abstract regularization approaches in symplectic geometry roughly fall into three classes : the _ kuranishi approach _ , introduced by fukaya - ono @xcite and implicitly li - tian @xcite , and further developed by fukaya - oh - ohta - ono @xcite and joyce @xcite in the 2000s , works with local finite dimensional reductions ",
    "classically smooth sections @xmath6 of orbibundles in which both base and fiber are finite dimensional  and obtains the global zero set @xmath7 as a quotient by transition data .",
    "the _ obstruction bundle approach _ introduced by liu - tian @xcite , ruan  @xcite , and siebert @xcite works with the zero set of a continuous map @xmath3 which has local obstruction bundles @xmath8 that cover the cokernel of @xmath9 in local , but generally not compatible , smooth structures .",
    "polyfold approach _ developed by hofer - wysocki - zehnder",
    "[ hwz14 ] in the 2000s also works with a global section @xmath3 but equips the bundle with a global generalized smooth structure in which @xmath10 is fredholm .",
    "the original goal of our discussions , beginning with @xcite in 2009 , which have motivated much new work in this field @xcite , was to clarify how these approaches resolve the fundamental difficulty in regularizing pseudoholomorphic curve moduli spaces : elements of @xmath5 are equivalence classes of pseudoholomorphic maps modulo reparametrization by a finite dimensional group of automorphisms .",
    "this action is smooth on finite dimensional sets of smooth maps , but it is nowhere differentiable as action on a classical banach space of maps ; see e.g.  @xcite . while one of the cornerstones of the polyfold approach is a new notion of smoothness that includes infinite dimensional reparametrization actions , the other approaches need to deal with this issue only in the notion of compatibility between different local obstruction bundles resp .  local finite dimensional reductions .",
    "we communicated in @xcite a variety of fundamental issues : the obstruction bundle approach as explained in @xcite makes differentiability assumptions on the transition data that do guarantee a virtual fundamental class , but which generally do not hold in the analytic setting for pseudoholomorphic curves . in the kuranishi approach we found that geometric construction of local finite dimensional reductions following @xcite does yield smooth transition data .",
    "however , as of 2011 , algebraically inconsistent notions of kuranishi structure were still in use ( see @xcite ) , and fundamental topological issues were not addressed in generalizing the perturbative construction of the euler class to the kuranishi context ( see @xcite ) .",
    "* aim of this paper : * we develop a theory of topological kuranishi atlases and cobordisms that transparently resolves the algebraic and topological issues of kuranishi regularization . to demonstrate the universal applicability of our theory  originally developed in @xcite in the context of smooth atlases with trivial isotropy  we formulate it in a context of atlases that consist of continuous maps @xmath6 between locally compact metric spaces .",
    "thus our theory allows bases @xmath11 with boundary and corners , sections @xmath12 with weak differentiability properties , or arising as quotients by isotropy group actions .",
    "our theory then provides a framework for the regularization , in particular a global ambient space and section @xmath3 made up of local sections modulo transition data . to obtain a virtual fundamental class @xmath13 $ ] from this framework ,",
    "one still has to add suitable differentiability and orientation assumptions , and in that context construct compatible transverse perturbations of the local zero sets @xmath14 , or more abstract compatible local euler classes as in @xcite .",
    "however , our framework allows for a straightforward perturbation theory in which compatibility , hausdorffness , and compactness of the perturbed zero set are automatic .",
    "we demonstrate this in the case of smooth kuranishi atlases with trivial isotropy in @xcite and extend it to finite but not necessarily effective isotropy in @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite show that gromov - witten moduli spaces fit into this framework .",
    "the following describes the new abstract framework and scope of applications in more detail .",
    "* moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves : * in the applications to symplectic geometry , one wishes to assign a fundamental cycle to a compactified moduli space @xmath15 of pseudoholomorphic curves in a symplectic manifold @xmath16 . since in the algebro - geometric setting ( when @xmath16 carries a complex structure ) the space @xmath15 carries a virtual fundamental class , one expects well defined homological information also in the symplectic setting . in that case",
    ", @xmath16 carries a contractible space of almost complex structures @xmath17 .",
    "thus elements of @xmath15 are not described algebraically but analytically : for fixed @xmath17 , any element of the moduli space @xmath15 ( i.e.  @xmath17-curve ) has a neighbourhood @xmath18 that is homeomorphic @xmath19 to the zero set of a fredholm section @xmath20 that is equivariant under a finite isotropy group @xmath21 . in the best case scenario ( equivariant transversality of @xmath20 )",
    "this makes @xmath15 a smooth oriented orbifold , which has a fundamental class in the rational homology of @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , if transversality can be achieved in families , then this homological information is independent of the choice of @xmath17 via cobordisms .",
    "however , while any choice of @xmath17 yields an equivariant fredholm section , many situations do not allow for a @xmath17 that also achieves transversality .",
    "this is a pervasive problem in symplectic geometry , where most modern tools  from the floer theory used in the proof of the arnold conjecture to the fukaya categories involved in mirror symmetry  require the regularization of various moduli spaces . however ,",
    "unless a suitable type of injectivity of the @xmath17-curves is known a priori , no variation of geometric structure ( e.g.  the choice of @xmath17 ) will yield equivariant transverse perturbations .",
    "in such cases , the kuranishi approach aims to implement the perfect obstruction theory of algebraic geometry by choosing obstruction spaces @xmath22 which locally cover the cokernel of the fredholm sections @xmath20 and yield finite dimensional reductions @xmath23 .",
    "such kuranishi charts roughly consist of a @xmath21-equivariant section @xmath24 of a finite rank bundle @xmath25 . depending on the specific context ,",
    "the base @xmath26 might have additional structure such as boundary and corners ( on which the chart is given as fiber product of kuranishi charts on other moduli spaces ) , evaluation maps to @xmath16 , or forgetful maps to deligne - mumford moduli spaces , and the section @xmath10 might only be stratified smooth . however , the key difference to algebraic geometry is in the uniqueness : already the local fredholm description involves non - canonical choices , and a transition map between different charts is generally just an identification of zero sets @xmath27 .",
    "an extension to a map @xmath28 between the base spaces has to be constructed and is not unique either .    * ideas and challenges of kuranishi regularization : * given a cover of a compact metric space @xmath29 ( e.g.  @xmath30 ) by kuranishi charts @xmath31 involving @xmath32-equivariant sections @xmath6 , and a suitable compatibility notion between these charts , one wishes to regularize such a space @xmath33 with kuranishi atlas @xmath34 by means of abstract perturbations of the local sections .",
    "the expected degree of this class is the fixed dimension @xmath35 of charts in the atlas , and pre-2011 regularization results claim virtual moduli cycles in the following sense : _ given suitable evaluation maps @xmath36 there exists a class of perturbations @xmath37 such that the push - forwards @xmath38 define cycles @xmath39_\\nu \\in c_d(m)$ ] whose homology class is independent of @xmath40 . _",
    "our framework allows for a more direct regularization in terms of cycles that represent a homology class on @xmath33 , which can then be pushed forward by evaluation maps . in the case of trivial isotropy",
    ", @xcite builds on the present paper to prove the following :    0ex    _ let @xmath33 be a compact metrizable space",
    ". then any cobordism class of @xmath41-dimensional weak additive kuranishi atlases @xmath42 on @xmath33 determines uniquely _    * a * virtual moduli cycle * , that is a cobordism class of smooth , compact manifolds , and * a * virtual fundamental class * @xmath43^{vir}_{{\\mathcal k}}\\in \\check{h}_d(x;{{\\mathbb q}})$ ] in ech homology .    in the case of nontrivial isotropy ,",
    "the analogous result  with  weighted branched manifolds \" in place of manifolds  is proven in @xcite by combining the present paper with the techniques in @xcite applied to a more complicated categorical setting . under reasonable differentiability assumptions on the local sections @xmath6 , transverse ( multi - valued ) perturbations and hence a smooth ( weighted branched ) structure",
    "are easily achieved locally , leaving the following challenges :    capture compatibility between overlapping local models appropriately ;    construct compatible transverse ( possibly multivalued ) perturbations ;    ensure that the resulting locally smooth zero sets remain compact and hausdorff ( resp .",
    "in the case of nontrivial isotropy have consistent weights on their branches ) ;    capture orientation data that induces coherent orientations on the perturbed zero sets ;    establish suitable independence from the choice of perturbations ;    capture the effect of varying @xmath17 in a cobordism theory ;    appropriately describe the invariant information obtained from perturbed zero sets .    in the case of a section @xmath44 of an ( orbi)bundle ( i.e.  a kuranishi atlas with a single chart ) , challenges ( a ) and ( b ) above are absent so that generic ( multi - valued ) perturbations yield locally smooth solution sets .",
    "challenge ( c ) is resolved by the ambient space @xmath26 that is hausdorff and locally compact .",
    "straightforward cobordism theories deal with challenges ( d ) and ( e ) , and finally a metric on the ambient space @xmath26 allows for the construction of @xmath13^{vir}\\in h_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\rm rk}\\ , e - \\dim u}(s^{-1}(0);{{\\mathbb q}})$ ] as inverse limit in ech homology .",
    "however , once several charts are involved , their base spaces will usually have different dimensions and hence are at best related by embeddings @xmath45 of open subsets @xmath46 into a larger dimensional domain @xmath47 .",
    "this immediately causes fundamental challenges :    the cocycle condition @xmath48 holds automatically only on the zero sets @xmath49 , which are related via embeddings to the moduli space @xmath33 . in order to be able to patch local perturbations of these zero sets together ,",
    "this condition must be extended to open subsets of the base spaces @xmath50 as an axiom on the transition maps @xmath51 .",
    "however , the natural cocycle condition that is obtained from analytical constructions  equality on the overlap  does not even induce an ambient set @xmath52 since the transition maps only induce a transitive relation @xmath53 if each @xmath54 extends @xmath55 .    while one could easily add a transverse perturbation @xmath56 to each section @xmath57 , patching of the perturbed zero sets @xmath58 requires compatible perturbations in the sense that @xmath59 .",
    "unless charts are totally ordered , compatible with the direction of transition maps , this yields more conditions than degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , there will be obstructions to transversality and even smoothness of perturbations unless images of transition maps intersect nicely .",
    "given compatible transverse perturbations , the perturbed space @xmath60 has smooth charts , but there is no good reason for the quotient topology to be hausdorff other than an embedding into a hausdorff ambient space @xmath52 .",
    "while there are types of atlases that guarantee hausdorffness , this requires even stronger compatibility of the charts , in particular the domains of @xmath54 and @xmath55 need to agree exactly .",
    "moreover , the quotient topology on such an ambient space is not locally compact or metrizable if there is a nontrivial transition map between domains of different dimension .",
    "thus there is neither a natural notion of `` small perturbations '' nor a good reason why they should yield a compact perturbed space @xmath61 .    on the upside , it turns out that our approaches to overcoming these obstacles also naturally yield all the tools necessary for the direct construction of the virtual fundamental class .    * key notions and results : * in order to obtain a coherent theory that resolves these challenges transparently , we develop in section  [ s : chart ] notions of topological kuranishi charts and coordinate changes that underlie all existing notions in e.g.  @xcite , see remark  [ rmk : topchart ] .",
    "our resolutions of the challenges ( a) ( g ) then proceed as follows .",
    "definition  [ def : ku ] introduces the notion of * topological kuranishi atlas * on a compact metrizable space @xmath33 , consisting of a covering @xmath62 by basic charts with footprints @xmath63 , whose compatibility is captured by transition charts with footprints @xmath64 and directional coordinate changes @xmath65 for each @xmath66 that satisfy a cocycle condition .",
    "such an atlas @xmath42 can equivalently be seen as a bundle functor between topological categories @xmath67 together with a section functor @xmath68 and an embedding @xmath69 to the zero set @xmath70 .",
    "this categorical language allows us to succintly express compatibility conditions between maps and spaces of interest , and it yields a * virtual neighbourhood * @xmath71 of @xmath72 in definition  [ def : knbhd ] .",
    "definition  [ def : ku3 ] introduces the notion of * filtered weak topological kuranishi atlas * , which is the structure that naturally arises from local fredholm descriptions of a moduli space . as we demonstrate for gromov ",
    "witten moduli spaces in @xcite , these satisfy a weaker form of the cocycle condition ( equality on the overlap ) but have a natural filtration arising from `` additive choices of obstruction spaces '' .",
    "theorem  [ thm : k ] then shows that every filtered weak topological kuranishi atlas has a * tame shrinking * which satisfies the stronger cocycle and filtration conditions stated in definition  [ def : tame ] .",
    "for such a tame atlas @xmath42 , the virtual neighbourhood @xmath73 is hausdorff with embeddings @xmath74 .",
