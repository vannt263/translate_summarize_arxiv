    "in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , two - particle correlation is a powerful tool to investigate the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "this observable is sensitive to the near and away side jet structure , resonances and collective effects @xcite .",
    "which effect dominates the correlation is strongly determined by the kinematic region of the investigated particles , as well as the event class as discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ heavy quarks ( charm and beauty ) are of particular importance in this context .",
    "they are often used as probes of the qgp , since they are produced mainly during the initial stages of the collisions through hard parton - parton scattering processes , and subsequently they experience the entire evolution of the system and they might participate in the collective expansion of the medium .",
    "one of the common approaches in the study of heavy quarks is the measurement of electrons from the decay of hadrons containing such particles .",
    "this is the technique exploited in the present work .",
    "+ in order to address the qgp properties , a given observable is often studied as a function of the event class ( centrality ) of the collision and in various collision systems .",
    "the correlation function of electrons from heavy - flavour decays and light hadrons was measured with alice in pp and central and semi - central pb - pb collisions .",
    "furthermore , for the case of pp collisions , the relative beauty contribution to the total cross section of electrons from heavy - flavour decays was estimated by comparing the measured correlation function with monte - carlo templates .",
    "at the lhc , alice is dedicated to the study of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "alice has excellent capabilities for heavy - flavour measurements thanks to several subsystems which allow vertexing and track reconstruction with high resolution and particle identification ( pid ) in a wide momentum range @xcite .",
    "the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) are the main pid detectors used in the present analysis .",

    "this background is mainly composed by electrons from photon conversions in the detector material and light meson ( e. g. @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons ) dalitz decays .",
    "this contribution can be statistically estimated through the invariant mass of @xmath9 pairs where the combinatorial background is determined using like - sign pairs ( @xmath6 ) .",

    "the remaining hadron contamination in the electron sample is removed by scaling down the di - hadron correlation distribution and subtracting it from the one of inclusive electrons .",
