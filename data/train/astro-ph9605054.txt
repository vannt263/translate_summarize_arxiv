    "the  ( far  infrared  absolute  spectrophotometer ) instrument aboard the  ( cosmic background explorer ) satellite ( boggess  1992 and references therein ; bennett  1992a ) was designed to measure the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) . in the simple hot big bang model",
    "the spectrum has a blackbody form , but it could be distorted by energy release after a redshift @xmath4 ( peebles 1971 , sunyaev & zeldovich 1980 ) .",
    "after the annihilation of positrons and the decoupling of neutrinos until @xmath5 , the cmbr was the dominant energy field .",
    "the number of photons exceeds the number of baryons by a factor @xmath6 , so excellent sensitivity is required to detect even large radiant energy releases .",
    "spectral distortion limits from the firas were presented by .",
    "these were based on @xmath7  days of high galactic latitude data from a single detector and scan mode .",
    "the dipole spectrum was also determined ( fixsen  1994a ) from this single detector .  found that the spectrum and dipole are consistent with a simple big bang model .",
    "all of the previous work in this frequency range ( 2 to 21 ) was based on part of the data from a single detector .",
    "this paper uses all of the low frequency data from the 10 month mission , except for the first month when settings were frequently readjusted to reach the optimum condition , approximately doubling the statistical weight of the results .",
    "there have been several improvements in the calibration that we note , but the basic calibration process remains the same .",
    "the instrument was recalibrated using the method described in .",
    "the calibration was applied to the sky data , producing spectra from 2 to 21   ( 5000 to 480 @xmath8 m ) .",
    "five important improvements were made to the calibration : ( 1 ) a bias in some pixels is corrected ; ( 2 ) insufficiently sampled pixels ",
    "borrow \" data from neighboring pixels to determine a template for deglitching ( removing effects of cosmic ray hits on the detector ) ; ( 3 ) data with a large number of glitches ( cosmic ray hits ) are deweighted relative to data with few glitches ; ( 4 ) we use 320 points in the spectrum rather than 256 ; and ( 5 ) the data are  destriped \" after the calibration .",
    "each of these processes is described in more detail below .",
    "the firas is a polarizing michelson interferometer , described by mather  ( 1990 , 1993 ) .",
    "it measures the spectral difference between a 7  patch of sky and an internal blackbody .",
    "the symmetric firas optics are differential , with two input and two output ports .",
    "one input port receives emission from the sky , defined by a non - imaging concentrator .",
    "the other input port receives emission from an internal reference calibrator ( emissivity @xmath9 ) with an associated concentrator .",
    "each of the two output beams ( arbitrarily labeled  left \" and  right \" ) is split by a dichroic filter into low and high frequency beams , separated at 20 , feeding four silicon composite bolometer detectors operated simultaneously .",
    "an external blackbody calibrator provides the critical absolute calibration .",
    "the other elements are operated in the same manner while taking sky data or calibration data so the @xmath10 requirement on them is that they be repeatable .",
    "although we verify that the emissivities of the concentrators and internal calibrator are reasonable , the fundamental comparison is between the sky and the external calibrator . during calibration",
    "the sky aperture is completely filled by the external calibrator with an emissivity @xmath11 , calculated and measured .",
    "the external calibrator is isothermal to better than 1  mk at 2.7 k according to calculation . during calibration",
    "the sky acts as a back drop to the external calibrator , so residual transmission is still nearly 2.73 k radiation .",
    "most of the radiation reflected by the external calibrator was originally emitted by it and then returned by reflection within the concentrator , contributing to the effective emissivity .",
    "the next largest source of incident radiation towards the calibrator is the emission from the concentrator but this is also at 2.7 k and thus introduces negligible error .",
    "the only important sources of radiation on the calibrator not at 2.7 k are the detector at 1.65 k and the general instrument at @xmath121.5 k. the measured and calculated reflectance of the calibrator for this radiation is @xmath13 at 1 @xmath14 and diminishes rapidly with frequency .",
    "thus the spectrum uncertainty of the firas instrument due to the external calibrator is approximately 10 parts per million .",
    "the full story of the external calibrator will be covered in a future paper .",
    "the temperatures of the two calibrators and associated concentrators are controllable from 2 to 25 k. redundant thermometers measure the temperatures of these four temperature controlled elements and other infrared emitters such as the moving mirrors , the mechanical structure , and the detector housings . when observing the sky , the spectrometer is operated with its output nearly nulled , by adjusting the internal calibrator temperature .",
    "this reduces sensitivity to gain errors and instrument drifts .",
    "the path difference @xmath15 between the two arms of the interferometer is varied by scanning a pair of mirrors at a constant velocity .",
    "this motion produces a modulated power @xmath16 at the output ports .",
    "@xmath16 is approximately the cosine transform of the net power @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the effective instrument tendue for each emitting element , @xmath19 is the spectral intensity of each emitter , and @xmath20 is the frequency in .",
    "the principal inputs are the sky ( or external calibrator ) and the internal calibrator , which are @xmath21  out of phase and thus enter into eqn .",
    "1 with opposite signs . each of the outputs of the interferometer also receives emission from other components of the instrument .",
    "the mirrors are scanned at one of two velocities (  slow \" and  fast \" ) , and over one of two lengths (  short \" and  long \" ) .",
    "an insignificant amount of data was taken in the long slow mode so there are 12 data sets ( 4 detectors at each of 3 scan modes ) .",
    "the long data ( up to 5.9 cm excursion ) were truncated to match the short data ( with maximum 1.2 cm excursion ) for this analysis .",
    "in retrospect perhaps all of the data should have been taken in the short slow mode but at the launch of cobe the detailed nature of the cmbr was not as clear as it is now .",
    "the use of two velocities allows clear separation of some instrument effects ( eg . vibration ) from optical or sky effects .",
    "although the high frequency ( @xmath22 ) radiation was effectively excluded from the low frequency detectors , the filter reflected low frequency radiation into the high frequency detectors .",
    "we do not use the 6 high frequency data sets as the calibration for these is more susceptible to systematic error .",
    "the detectors do not have equal noise .",
    "thus even though we include 5 additional data sets we only double the statistical weight of the  left low short slow \" data set used in the previous publications .",
    "the firas points @xmath23 from the sun and away from the earth as the _ cobe _ orbits the earth with a period of 103  minutes .",
    "the orbit plane is maintained approximately perpendicular to the direction to the sun .",
    "this scan pattern concentrates the observing time near the ecliptic poles .",
    "we divide the sky into 6144 equal area pixels according to a quadrilateralized spherical cube representation ( oneill and laubscher 1976 ) .",
    "each pixel has @xmath24 of the beam area .",
    "the data are sorted ,  deglitched \" , averaged , calibrated , averaged again and  destriped \" by a series of programs . at each step variance",
    "is calculated and statistics of the results checked .",
    "the final result is a map of 6144 pixels ( 76 are unobserved ) with a spectrum at each pixel .",
    "a total of 1411829 good ( free from transmission errors ) 512 point sky interferograms were received .",
    "approximately 20% of the sky data is rejected for various conditions ( eg . sky horn temperature , high noise , bolometer temperature too high etc ) . after sorting into the 12 data sets , 11 mission periods , 6114 pixels , and several instrument states the remaining 1138149 interferograms",
    "are sorted into 272525 groups with an average of @xmath25 interferograms per group or coadd .",
    "there are an average of 187 interferograms per pixel corresponding to an integration time of @xmath26 minutes .    in the first part of the mission",
    ", the calibrator was commanded into the horn approximately 2 days each month .",
    "however for the last 6 weeks of the mission the calibrator was commanded into the horn approximately 3 days each week .",
    "thus approximately 10% of the data set is calibration data .",
    "there are 149260 calibration interferograms .",
    "approximately 10% of the calibration interferograms are rejected .",
    "the fraction is lower for the calibration data because it was primarily collected near the end of the mission when we had more experience operating firas .",
    "the remaining 134739 interferograms are sorted into 3028 coadds with an average of 44 interferograms per coadd .",
    "the calibration coadds are larger because they are not divided into pixels .",
    "the maximum size coadd is arbitrarily set at 100 .",
    "a robust estimate of each coadd average is formed at each point in the interferogram , to aid in recognizing glitches .",
    "this average is subtracted from each interferogram to yield a  noise \" interferogram .",
    "the individual interferograms are  deglitched \" using a modified  clean \" algorithm ( isaacman  1992 ) .",
    "the glitches are recognized by their shape which is due to the bolometer and amplifier response to a delta function .",
    "glitches are probably due to cosmic particle hits on the detectors so they are not correlated to the position of the mirrors .",
    "thus they add only noise . in the raw data",
    "most of the noise is in the glitches so deglitching is critical to the noise .",
    "we average the center half of the data to form a robust template . in the case of @xmath27 interferograms ,",
    "the top @xmath28 points and the bottom @xmath28 points are discarded and the remaining @xmath29 points are averaged . in the case of @xmath30 or @xmath31 interferograms the top @xmath28 points and bottom @xmath28 points are discarded leaving @xmath32 or @xmath33 to be averaged . while this is not exactly the center half , it is close and there is no bias . in the case of @xmath34",
    "interferograms our previous analysis ignored the bottom @xmath35 points and the top @xmath28 leaving @xmath32 points to be averaged .",
    "clearly this biases the template , but a simple bias in the interferogram domain leads to only a dc term in the spectral domain , and the dc term ( zero frequency ) is not used .",
    "since both sky and calibration observations are broad band features , the central peak of the interferogram has most of the signal and hence some real signal .",
    "this extra signal causes the ",
    "clean \" algorithm to infer extra  glitches \" at the peak only . in the unbiased case",
    "this regresses the data towards the mean , which is a robust average of the group so this is not a problem . in the case",
    "where the template is biased this induces a small deviation in the interferogram , which becomes a small amplitude wide band distortion in the spectrum .",
    "this is not enough by itself to cause a problem , because the calibration data use the same procedure and thus suffer the same distortion .",
    "however , the calibration data are collected in large groups , while the sky coadds form small groups , as the sky data are scattered over many pixels .",
    "this bias appeared most pronounced in the sky data using only six interferograms .    to fix this bias , we changed the template for the case with @xmath34 interferograms to discard the bottom @xmath28 points and the top @xmath28 points .",
    "the top point and bottom point of the remaining @xmath36 points are included in the average with the other @xmath29 points but with only half the weight as a better approximation to the average of the center half .",
    "for groups with fewer than eight interferograms , we included interferograms from neighboring pixels ( up to 8 total ) to form the robust estimate for deglitching only . if there were a sufficient number of interferograms ( 8 or more ) we did not use neighboring pixels .",
    "after the data were deglitched the interferograms from the original pixel were averaged like the other groups .",
    "this borrowing of neighboring interferograms allows us to deglitch data where there are only a few interferograms in a group .",
    "this allows us to add an additional 15% of the data and closes many of the gaps that are otherwise unobserved .",
    "we checked this procedure to verify that it did not introduce biases .",
    "the noise in a single interferogram is high so it is possible to use data from a neighboring pixel to approximate the original data .",
    "the neighboring pixels are sampled by the beam which is almost 3 pixels across and there is little gradient in most of the sky so the actual signal difference is small .",
    "we selected the closest interferograms ( in angle ) from neighboring pixels from the same time period and at the same galactic latitude for @xmath37 .",
    "the same result is obtained when we exclude the data using neighboring pixels .",
    "we also compared directly the spectra with and without using neighbors in the deglitching .",
    "finally we compared the spectra with and without using neighbors in the high frequency galactic plane data .",
    "this is a more sensitive test , because the galaxy exhibits high gradients and sharper spectral features . in all cases",
    "the differences were consistent with the expected random noise .",
    "the other features of the deglitching remain as in the previous work ( see isaacman  1992 ) . as in the previous calibration in some cases a second template",
    "was subtracted to allow for gradients across a pixel and the ",
    "clean \" procedure was iterated .",
    "each interferogram is assigned a statistical weight before averaging .",
    "we estimate the variance as a function of glitch rate ( or glitch number , as the duration of all interferograms is the same for a given scan mode ) .",
    "this is modeled as @xmath38 , where v is the variance , g is the glitch rate and a and b are parameters fit for each detector and scan mode . from the deglitching",
    "there are estimates of the variance for each of the 272525 coadds .",
    "these variance estimates are fit to @xmath38 for each detector and scan mode .",
    "the weight is then modeled as @xmath39 .",
    "although the group estimated variances , @xmath40 , are not biased , a weight , which is the inverse of the variance , is biased high by the presence of fluctuations .",
    "this is particularly important ( 25% effect ) for the small coadds of the sky but it is also significant for the larger coadds of the calibration data . to minimize this bias we use an entire data set to fit for @xmath42 and @xmath43 rather than the variance of a single group to estimate variance and weight .",
    "typically 25 glitches halves the weight , and there are typically 15 glitches in each interferogram . the weighted average interferogram is calculated and converted to a spectrum by apodization , zero padding , and fourier transformation .",
    "the total weight of the coadd is carried along as a weight of the spectrum .",
    "the weighted average of the covariance at each frequency was estimated for each detector and scan mode using the dispersion of these weighted spectra .",
    "this variance was used in following calculations to compute the statistical weights .",
    "when fitting in the frequency domain we need to include the correlation effects .",
    "we use the inverse of the covariance matrix to weight the data .",
    "the covariance between frequencies is well approximated by @xmath44 .",
    "the expression @xmath45  can take on the values ( 0,0.4538, ...",
    ",19.06 ) for which @xmath46 takes on the values ( 1.000 , 0.176,@xmath470.203 , 0.145 , 0.077,@xmath470.005,@xmath470.022 , 0.032 , 0.053 , 0.025,@xmath470.003 , 0.007 , 0.029 , 0.029 , 0.003,@xmath470.002 , 0.016 , 0.020 , 0.011 , 0.002 , 0.007 , 0.011 , 0.009 , 0.003,@xmath470.004,@xmath470.001 , 0.003 , 0.003,@xmath470.001,@xmath470.003 , 0.000 , 0.003 , 0.009 , 0.015 , 0.008 , 0.003,@xmath470.002 , 0.000,@xmath470.006,@xmath470.006 , 0.000 , 0.002 , 0.008 ) .",
    "the values for @xmath48 are in table 3 for the dipole and in table 4 for the cmbr spectrum .",
    "the covariance matrix could also be calculated analytically by propagating delta functions through the apodization , fourier transform , and calibration process .",
    "these generally agree but there are parameters of the electronic filters , effects of self apodization , and effects of the deglitching which complicate the calculation so we use the estimated covariance matrix .",
    "the  calibration procedure was used .",
    "this includes @xmath49 parameters for each detector and scan mode .",
    "some of the parameters are nonlinear and the process involves considerable computation . for a more detailed description see . here",
    "we will only address the changes in that procedure . rather than weighting according to the variance of each spectrum at each frequency , we used the mission average for the noise spectrum shape ( dependence on frequency ) for each type of spectrum ( particular setting of temperatures ) and the glitch weighting to scale the noise of each coadd .",
    "the nyquist frequency ( set by the sampling rate ) is 145.212 .",
    "our use of a 320 point spectrum leaves 43 significant elements in the 2 to 21  frequency range .",
    "the excursion of the mirrors is not symmetric with about 1.2 cm in one direction and 0.5 cm in the other .",
    "thus there is information down to 0.4 @xmath14 rather than only to 0.56 @xmath14 . by zero padding the short end of the interferogram out to a total of 640 points , we can use more of the information from the fourier transform which otherwise winds up in the imaginary part of the spectrum .",
    "the resulting real elements are not independent but our analyses include correlation effects .",
    "the truncated long and short interferograms are calibrated together .",
    "there are eight data sets or  channels \" ( 4 detectors @xmath50  2 speeds ) .",
    "the data taken with the external calibrator in the input aperture were used to construct a calibration model for each channel .",
    "each model includes 7 parameters to describe the bolometer , 2 parameters for the j - fet amplifier , 6 parameters for the spectrometer and 5 parameters for the unwanted vibrations .",
    "the model is nonlinear in these parameters .",
    "the temperature of each of the four  controllables \" and an overall time shift for each coadd are also parameters of the fit , with constraints consistent with the thermometer readout noise ( temperature dependent ) .",
    "the model is almost linear in these parameters .",
    "a complex number at each frequency parameterizes the emission from each of seven sources : internal and external calibrators , sky and reference concentrators , mirrors , structure , and bolometer housing , with the kirchhoff constraint that they sum to zero .",
    "the model is linear in these parameters .",
    "the complex number for the external calibrator is identified as the transfer function , as the external calibrator is black and fills the beam .",
    "the @xmath51 for the calibration for each channel is given in table [ x2 ] .",
    "excess @xmath51 indicates an imperfect model of the bolometer and vibration , and other possible errors .",
    "the imperfect bolometer model is also indicated by preflight data on the bolometers alone .",
    "the @xmath51/dof for the cold null , sky - like coadds are much closer to unity .",
    "this is expected because the hot calibrations stress the model much more than the near null sky conditions .",
    "the fitted calibration models are then applied to both the sky and calibration spectra , resulting in a sky coadds and calibration coadds in absolute flux units .",
    "after calibration the sky spectra are adjusted to the solar system barycenter to account for the earth s orbital velocity around the sun , which would otherwise be readily detectable as an additional variable dipole of amplitude 0.3 mk .",
    "although this further correlates the data , the correlation effect is negligible since the earth s velocity around the sun is @xmath52 .",
    "after the barycenter corrected coadds were produced , a linear fit was made to the sky and calibration coadds from all four low frequency channels at each frequency .",
    "the fit includes 14 time dependent templates , 4 temperature templates , and a parameter for the sky emission at each pixel and frequency .",
    "thus 18 stripe parameters and 6068 fluxes are used to fit @xmath53 coadds separately at each frequency . by simultaneously fitting all of the data sets with a single  best \" sky and a photometric model",
    ", we get the maximum amount of cross checking on each data set . by simultaneously fitting the calibration data",
    "we effectively recalibrate the data , get the best sky signal , and get a covariance matrix to measure the correlations we have introduced by this process .",
    "the @xmath51 for this fitting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fstripe ] .",
    "the templates consist of two global decaying exponentials with time constants of 61 and 153 days , and step functions for three time periods for each of the four channels .",
    "the exponentials were included because an exponential - like decay was seen in the data , both in the sky data and in the calibration data ( fixsen  1994b ) .",
    "the cause of this is not known but it is seen in all of the detectors and scan modes .",
    "the time period templates were unity during a certain period and zero at other times .",
    "two of the periods were when the concentrator temperatures were raised to 6k and 4k respectively .",
    "the third period covers the rest of the time when the concentrator temperatures were 2.73k .",
    "the transition between these periods was very short and not used .",
    "the temperature of the dihedral mirrors was also used as a template because parts of the instrument had temperature fluctuations of @xmath54  k , correlated with the dihedral mirror temperature .",
    "we use a separate model for each channel because the higher temperatures may have different effects on the different detectors .",
    "the calibration corrected for these , but there is uncertainty in the correction .",
    "we reduce the residual uncertainty by using the more abundant sky data to determine the corrections .",
    "gave the absolute temperature of the cmbr as 2.726 @xmath55 0.010 k , with a conservative systematic uncertainty estimate .",
    "they noted a discrepancy between the thermometers and the color temperature scale .",
    "we have accounted for most of the discrepancy by using the low frequency lines to calibrate the frequency scale rather than the high frequency scale .",
    "since the uncertainty in going from the firas temperature scale to the cmbr temperature scale in only a few @xmath8k we discuss them together .",
    "only the absolute temperature of the external calibrator is an issue since the other parts of the instrument only need to be stable .",
    "there are three ways of determining the cmbr temperature from the firas data set :    1 .",
    "we use the preflight calibration of the external calibrator thermometers , which should be good to the nominal 1 mk accuracy of the calibration specification .",
    "the task is quite simple since there exist substantial calibration data with the external calibrator at 2.73 k and other temperatures near the sky conditions .",
    "this gives a cmbr temperature of @xmath56  k , with the error entirely dominated by the absolute thermometry calibration error on the external calibrator .",
    "the main difficulty with this is that there is evidence that the internal calibrator thermometry has errors of @xmath57 mk and that the thermometer at the tip of the external calibrator differs from the other two by 3 mk ( at 2.73 k ) .",
    "there is some evidence from testing the alternate calibrators on the ground that both of these problems may be due to insufficient thermal contact for the thermometers embedded in epoxy at the tip , and that the two thermometers on the external calibrator fixed to the copper base ring should not have this problem .",
    "these were used in estimating the external calibrator temperature and the tip temperature is not used .",
    "we use the calibration data to determine the temperature scale .",
    "this effectively uses the  color \" to determine the temperature and so depends on the frequency determination .",
    "we have improved the frequency determination of the  ( see fig  [ ffreq ] ) .",
    "while  use the c@xmath58 ( 63 ) and n@xmath58 ( 49 ) lines , we note the possibility that the high frequency calibration and the low frequency calibration need not agree .",
    "a discrepancy can arise because the beam in the interferometer has divergence ( 5.5hwhm on average ) which because of the cosine effect implies a 0.5% frequency shift .",
    "however the beam profile of the high frequency light may be more strongly attenuated than the beam profile of the low frequency data . to improve the frequency scale we used a combination of co and c@xmath58 lines ( 7.69 , 11.53 , 15.38 , and 16.42 ) to make our low frequency determination to @xmath59% .",
    "the difference between the high frequency and low frequency scales implies a difference of 1 in average beam divergence .",
    "the 0.03% frequency uncertainty implies a temperature uncertainty of 0.82 mk .",
    "there is an additional 0.2 mk error in determining the color temperature once the frequency scale is set , but as this adds in quadrature it is negligible .",
    "the result of this analysis is that the cmbr temperature is @xmath60 k. 3 .",
    "we can also use the cmbr itself .",
    "if we assume the dipole is a result of a doppler shift the shape of the differential spectrum should be @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the planck function .",
    "the best fit temperature to the dipole spectrum ( see below ) is a cmbr temperature of @xmath63 k. this result depends on a differential spectrum so offsets of the instrument calibration do not matter . since the measurements are taken 50 minutes apart ( on opposite sides of the orbit ) , long term drifts ( of the sort we see and correct for ) also do not matter .",
    "this measurement is not completely independent because it still depends on the frequency calibration .",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in fitting the galaxy radiation which modulates the dipole signal which is only 0.1% of the cmbr signal in the rayleigh - jeans region .",
    "these three methods give answers that are within three sigma .",
    "apparently there are additional systematic errors in one or more of these methods .",
    "we conclude the absolute temperature of the cmbr is @xmath64  k ( 95% cl ) , entirely dominated by the systematic errors .",
    "while this is not a true statistical uncertainty it is a useful summary of the uncertainty in the result .",
    "the calibrated destriped sky spectra were then fit to four spatial templates .",
    "we use the firas data to determine the spectra of the four components .",
    "we model the data @xmath65 , where @xmath66 are galactic coordinates and @xmath20 is frequency , as follows : @xmath67 the monopole is represented by the spectrum @xmath68 ; the dipole variation is represented by the spatial distribution @xmath69 and the spectrum @xmath70 ; and the galactic emission is represented by one or two spatial distributions @xmath71 and corresponding spectra @xmath72 .",
    "the fit is made independently at each frequency , only the spatial variation is assumed .",
    "each of the resulting spectra will be discussed and further modeled below . in all cases the uncertainties due to this template fit",
    "are propagated to the following analysis .    to make this separation the functions @xmath69 for the dipole and @xmath71 for the galactic emission",
    "must be specified .",
    "the dipole is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the angle between the observation and the maximum of the dipole , @xmath75 ( bennett  1996 ) .",
    "for @xmath71 we tried several combinations of predictors .",
    "five templates for @xmath76 are :    1 .   a plane - parallel , @xmath77 distribution .",
    "this is clearly an oversimplification of the galaxy , but our results are independent of the galactic template used .",
    "this provides strong evidence that our results are not contaminated by any inadequacy of the model of the galactic emission .",
    "2 .   the spatial distribution of the total power received in the high frequency  channel above 25  . this is used under the assumption that the high frequency ( @xmath78@xmath14 ) radiation is well correlated to the low frequency ( @xmath79@xmath14 ) galactic radiation .",
    "the high frequency channel is centered on 41  @xmath14 with a 44  @xmath14 effective bandwidth . since the high and low frequency data are taken simultaneously through the same concentrator there is little mismatch in sky coverage and no need for beam convolution .",
    "3 .   dirbe ( diffuse infrared background experiment ) 240 @xmath8 m map , convolved to  resolution .",
    "this has the advantage of being totally independent and low noise but could suffer from beam convolution errors .",
    "the dirbe resolution is @xmath80 and the firas resolution is @xmath81 .",
    "dirbe 140 @xmath8 m map , convolved to  resolution .",
    "this in combination with the 240 @xmath8 m allows adjustments for varying dust temperatures .",

    "this has lower noise than the 140 @xmath8 m data but it is further afield in frequency and may be contaminated by other effects ( zodiacal emission ) .    for galaxy templates 2 - 5 we use the normalization @xmath82 model .",
    "the only effect of the normalization , of course , is to rescale the galaxy spectrum . with this normalization",
    "the resulting galaxy spectrum is the sky brightness near the galactic poles .",
    "the principal fit for this paper uses the dirbe 240 and dirbe 140 combination for @xmath71 and a 5  galactic cut .",
    "there is a high @xmath51  tail \" ( see fig 1 ) so after the fit was made , pixels with a @xmath83dof@xmath84 were removed .",
    "the fit was repeated with the remaining pixels and again pixels with a @xmath83dof@xmath84 were removed.this process was repeated until the pixels removed formed a stable set .",
    "this removes 58 pixels .    to investigate the sensitivity to these parameters",
    "many other fits were made .",
    "we also tried galactic cuts of 0 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , and 40 degrees .",
    "we tried fits to subsets of the data .",
    "we also tried each of the five galactic templates individually and the dirbe 240 & dirbe 100 , dirbe 240 & high frequency firas and high frequency firas & dirbe 140 combinations .",
    "while one spatial galactic template gives a reasonable result a proper combination of two templates greatly reduces the dependence on the galactic cut .",
    "we also varied the @xmath83dof cutoff from 1.3 to 3 .",
    "for other galactic models or other galactic cutoffs of course different pixels were removed . in particular for single component galactic models many pixels at low galactic latitudes were removed .",
    "these other fits form a background  cloud \" of solutions which test the result for systematic effects .",
    "we use the rms deviation of a solution amongst these to estimate the size of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the data are weighted according to the channel variance including glitch effects ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "the spectra which are determined by the fit are the linear coefficients of the three or four spatial components discussed above , made independently at each frequency .",
    "the result can be viewed as three or four spectra , one for each spatial component .",
    "it is important to note that this fit makes no a priori assumptions about the forms of these spectra ; only their spatial distribution is posited .      to get a single galactic spectrum",
    "we add the galactic spectra if there are more than one .",
    "the result is the average spectrum near the galactic poles",
    ". the galactic spectrum can be approximately fit by functions of the form @xmath85 .",
    "wright  ( 1991 ) examined the   galaxy spectrum and found that it was fit by @xmath86 and @xmath87  k. the galactic spectrum derived here , which is determined by high latitude galactic data , produces a lower temperature , @xmath88  k , with @xmath28 fixed at 2 and an emissivity of @xmath89 at 60 @xmath14 . with only the low frequency data used here we can not fit for both @xmath28 and the temperature .",
    "about half of temperature difference is due to the change in index from 1.65 to 2 and half from the change to the higher latitudes . even emphasizing the high galactic latitude regions the co and c@xmath58 lines are still evident .    when using the dirbe 240 and dirbe 140 templates to fit the galactic radiation we note that the dirbe 140 template produces a spectrum that is negative for all frequencies , however the strong correlation between dirbe 240 and dirbe 140 ensures that the sum is positive everywhere .",
    "the galactic fit to @xmath77 has more radiation at the galactic poles than the fit to the other galactic models , indicating that the sun is in a local  hole \" in the galaxy .",
    "this local  hole \" is approximately 2/3 as dense as a typical galactic location .",
    "the dust can be modeled with other forms as well .",
    "most of the information on the galactic regions is at higher frequencies .",
    "a full discussion of the galaxy requires the high frequency data ( see bennett 1994 and reach 1995 ) ; here the galactic radiation is treated as a contaminant of the cmbr .",
    "we fit the dipole spectrum to the derivative of a planck function @xmath90 where we fix @xmath91   and allow @xmath92 to vary .",
    "the best fit value of the dipole amplitude is @xmath93 mk @xmath94 mk .",
    "however the value is dependent on the galactic cutoff and the galaxy model . in our  cloud \" of solutions",
    "we find an rms variation of 0.006 mk . adding this in quadrature",
    "gives an uncertainty of 0.007 mk .",
    "we also make a 0.003 mk correction for the finite beamsize , which is approximately @xmath95 fwhm .",
    "the result is summarized in table  [ tderr ] .",
    "this amplitude of the dipole is in agreement with @xmath96 mk measured by the _",
    "cobe _ dmr ( bennett  1996 ) , derived from observations at 1.05 , 1.77 , and 3.00 @xmath14 . the dmr beam is also approximately 7@xmath97 but the details of the beam patterns are different .",
    "we do not include possible effects of the octupole and higher harmonics although because of our nonuniform sky coverage these might perturb our result .",
    "bennett  1996 includes these effects .",
    "the the dipole spectrum and the fitted planck derivative are shown in figure  [ fdipres ] and in table  [ tdipres ] .",
    "the weighted deviations , @xmath98 , from the blackbody derivative dipole spectrum are  rms , smaller than the deviations of the monopole from its fitted blackbody , primarily because it is less susceptible to systematic errors .    by choosing the monopole temperature as the point to evaluate @xmath61 ,",
    "we have forced the dipole temperature to be that of the monopole .",
    "if we fit both @xmath92 and @xmath99 we obtain @xmath91@xmath550.003  k ( @xmath100 statistical uncertainty ) .",
    "however the result is sensitive to the galactic cut .",
    "we add a systematic uncertainty of 0.006 to account for this effect .",
    "this results in a final estimation of @xmath91@xmath550.007  k ( @xmath100 combined uncertainty ) .",
    "the agreement of the dipole temperature with the monopole temperature is consistent with the conventional doppler interpretation of the dipole .",
    "it is also a confirmation that the overall temperature scale and calibration for the firas are consistent .",
    "we can also find the dipole direction from the firas data with a different fit .",
    "here we reverse the assumptions of the principal fit .",
    "we assume three spectra , a cmbr temperature and two galactic dust optical depths , one for each of the spectra derived from the dirbe templates in the principal fit , @xmath72 , and fit for their intensities at each pixel .",
    "the cmbr temperature assumes a planck spectrum .",
    "these spectra were chosen to match the shape of the spectrum in the data .",
    "this yields maps of the cmbr temperature and dust intensities . a monopole plus three dipole components",
    "are then fit to the resulting temperature map .",
    "the vector sum of the dipole coefficients points in the direction , consistent with the direction from the dmr results .",
    "data for @xmath101 were excluded from the dipole fit because of the potential inaccuracy of the model of the galaxy .",
    "the direction is particularly sensitive to the galaxy because it is almost orthogonal to the direction to the galactic center .",
    "galactic variations in spectral shape as a function of longitude couple into the angle directly while for the fixed angle case they come in as second order terms for the same reason .",
    "the monopole spectrum ( see fig 4 ) is well fit by a planck blackbody spectrum , and deviations are small , consistent with the earlier  results within their larger uncertainties ( shafer  1992 , cheng  1992 , and mather  1994 ) . to determine or constrain any deviations from a blackbody , consider a generic cosmological model @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is some cosmic parameter quantifying the deviation from a blackbody , such as the kompaneets @xmath104 parameter for comptonized spectra or the dimensionless chemical potential @xmath8 for a bose - einstein photon distribution .",
    "because the deviation is small , a linear fit @xmath105 can be performed to the unknown parameters @xmath103 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "the first two terms are the planck blackbody spectrum , with the temperature @xmath108 .",
    "the third term allows for galactic contamination remaining in the monopole spectrum .",
    "the final term is the modeled deviation .",
    "we fit either the kompaneets parameter or the chemical potential , but the two are too similar to fit them simultaneously .",
    "the uncertainties are propagated from the template fits , and the correlation between the @xmath109 and @xmath110 increases the uncertainty of @xmath106 and @xmath103 .",
    "we use either the @xmath111 derived from the all sky data set ( see section 4 ) or @xmath112 and fit a temperature and emissivity .",
    "the @xmath112 model produces a lower @xmath51 with a temperature of 9 k and we use this model for the analysis in table 4 .",
    "one possible interpretation of this fit is a 9 k galactic halo or a cosmic background ( uniform component ) with a spectrum similar to the galactic spectrum",
    ". one must be cautious however as subtle variations in dust temperature or emissivity can produce similar effects .",
    "the determination of @xmath109 is dominated by low latitude galactic emission , and there is some variation from this form at higher latitudes .",
    "we vary the galactic latitude cutoff used in deriving @xmath113 in eqn .",
    "( 3 ) to test the effect of variations in the galactic spectrum from @xmath109 .",
    "variations greater than the statistical uncertainty in any derived parameters , such as the cosmological term @xmath103 , would most likely be due to an inadequacy in our galactic model .",
    "indeed if the @xmath51 cutoff is raised and the csc@xmath114 model is used such effects can be seen .",
    "when @xmath103 is fixed at 0 , there is only a galactic deviation fit , the weighted rms deviation in the frequency range 2  to 21  is   ( parts per million ) of the peak brightness .",
    "the weighted rms is defined as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the difference of the model and the data at spectrum point @xmath20 , and @xmath117 is the uncertainty of the spectrum point @xmath20 .",
    "the formal @xmath51 per degree of freedom = 46/40 = 1.15 .",
    "the residuals , with the errors , are shown in fig .",
    "[ ftres ] and listed in table  [ ttres ] .",
    "the best fit temperature is , which is determined by our choice of frequency and thermometry scales ( see section 4 ) .",
    "when comparing this to values from other experiments , the systematic thermometry uncertainty of  ( @xmath118 ) should be included .",
    "the detector noise part of the temperature uncertainty is only , and is entirely negligible .",
    "there are two likely forms for distortions of the primeval spectrum produced during the plasma epoch before recombination , and we compute a limit independently for each . energy release or conversion in the redshift range @xmath119 produces a bose - einstein distribution , where the planck law is modified by a dimensionless chemical potential @xmath8 ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1970 ) : @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath20 is measured in .",
    "the linearized deviation of @xmath122 from a blackbody is the derivative of eq .",
    "4 with respect to @xmath8 : @xmath123    the current  result is @xmath124 , or a 95%  confidence level upper limit of @xmath125 .",
    "this result and those following are summarized in table 2 , including the effects of systematic uncertainties and the variation of the result according to the galactic model used in the fit .      energy release at later times , @xmath126 , produces a comptonized spectrum , a mixture of blackbodies at a range of temperatures . in the case of",
    "non - relativistic electron temperatures this spectrum is described by the kompaneets ( 1957 ) equation , parameterized by the value of @xmath104 ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1969 ) : @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the electron temperature , the cmbr photon temperature , and the optical depth to electron compton scattering .",
    "the distortion will be of the form ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1969 ) @xmath131 the results are @xmath132 .",
    "there is some dependence on galactic cut and on the galactic model .",
    "this indicates either residual galactic contamination or a nearly uniform source with a spectrum simular to the galactic spectrum .",
    "we include a systematic uncertainty of @xmath133 to account for these effects for a final 95%  confidence level upper limit of .",
    "the limit for @xmath134 is about 1/3 as large as that given in  and the limit on @xmath135 is about 1/2 as large .",

    "these new values place stringent constraints on theories of the early universe and the development of cosmic structure .",
    "the cosmological interpretation of the limits on @xmath104 and @xmath8 are developed by wright  ( 1994 ) .",
    "we summarize their conclusions here briefly .",
    "since the  spectrum with the galactic dust emission removed is close to a blackbody , strict limits can be set on energy release after the big bang . for energy release during the bose - einstein period ,",
    "the limit is @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the energy of the cosmic background and @xmath138 is the energy converted from other forms . for energy release after that but before decoupling , the limit is @xmath139 . the result can be summarized as a limit on @xmath140 as a function of redshift shown in fig 6 .",

    "the cmbr dipole has a spectrum consistent with its thermal origin and a doppler shift .",
    "the dipole itself has a differential thermal spectrum the temperature of which , , agrees with the monopole temperature .",
