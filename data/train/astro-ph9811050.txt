    "bl lac objects , characterized by strong variability from the radio up to the gamma regime , variable polarization in the radio and optical domain as well as weak or absent emission lines in their spectra , are the most enigmatic active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . due to their extreme properties",
    "it is nowadays believed that their energy output is dominated by doppler@xmath0boosted synchrotron radiation arising from a relativistic jet , which is seen in a very small inclination angle ( urry & padovani 1995 ) . as a consequence observing their host galaxies and",
    "close environment is a challenge for observers , since the light of the relativistic jet in many cases overwhelms the light from the host galaxy .",
    "however , such studies are very important . by comparing isotropic properties of the individual subclasses of radio@xmath0loud agn , the `` unified scheme '' can be tested .",
    "for example , one would expect to find similar host galaxies for bl lac objects and their putative parents , the low@xmath0luminosity fanaroff@xmath0riley i radio galaxies . comparing the properties of bl lac host galaxies with `` normal '' ( inactive ) galaxies may give clues as to why some galaxies harbor an agn and ( perhaps ) others not . finally , they are one key to search for indications that the bl lac phenomenon is related to merging / interaction processes of galaxies ( feeding the monster ) as seems to be the case for quasars ( e.g. hutchings & neff 1992 , bahcall et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in recent years much effort has gone into studies of the host galaxies of bl lac objects using ground@xmath0based telescopes , leading to a rapidly increasing number of resolved host galaxies up to redshifts of @xmath2 .",
    "most of them ( perhaps all ) are hosted by luminous elliptical galaxies ( @xmath3 ; e.g. ulrich 1989 , abraham et al .",

    "we were able to carry out a fully 2@xmath0dimensional analysis of their host galaxies .",

    "the exposure times varied between 120s and 1800s depending on the brightness of the objects and the requirement not to saturate the bl lac .",
    "the nights were photometric , standard stars from landolt ( 1983 ) were frequently observed during each night to set the zero point .    the data were reduced ( debiased , flatfielded using twilight flatfields ) , cleaned of cosmics , aligned and coadded .",

    "as described in section 3.2 we used an iterative fitting procedure to derive the parameters for the host galaxy of the bl lac and for the close companion .",

    "this feature could be a projected faint galaxy ( b in fig .",
    "2d ) , although we can not rule out that it is part of the bl lac or the bright companion . whereas the residuals close to the center of both objects are artifacts due to the fitting procedure , the outer residuals for the companion @xmath0 in spite of feature b @xmath0 may be intrinsic to the source .    in order to test this",
    ", we carried out an isophotal analysis of the companion ( after subtraction of our model for the bl lac core + host ) by fitting ellipses to the images according to the method outlined by bender & mllenhoff ( 1988 ) .",
    "this method provides the azimuthally averaged surface brightness , ellipticity , position angle , the centers of the ellipses as well as the fourier coefficients as a function of the semi@xmath0major radius _ a _ and semi@xmath0minor radius _ b_. our isophotal analysis of the companion shows clear indications of an isophote twist . whereas @xmath14 grows from 0.2 at r = 2  to 0.45 at 4.5  and beyond , pa decreases from @xmath17 at 2  to @xmath18 at 4.5 .",
    "if we assume that the bl lac and the companion are at the same redshift , our observations and the isophotal analysis suggests that we observe an interacting pair of very bright elliptical galaxies , one of which hosts an active nucleus .",
    "we note that the redshift of 1es 1440 + 122 could be contaminated by its close companion . therefore to verify our scenario redshifts of both galaxies",

    "the average of the hosts of our bl lac objects with firm redshift is @xmath023.1 and the average is 9.3 kpc ( see table 2 ) .",

    "after subtraction of our model from the image , the feature to the north appears to be resolved , round and well separated from the bl lac .",

    "the optical appearance is striking and suggestive of a tidal tail resulting either from an interaction between both galaxies or a merging process , where material was stripped off the companion .",
    "after we had properly masked the companion and the `` tidal tail '' we were able to make a very good fit to the system .",
    "the host galaxy is very round ( @xmath19 ) with = @xmath022.9 and = 9.4 kpc .",
    "photometry of the companion gives @xmath6 21.8 , which would imply = @xmath019.2 at z = 0.212 .",
    "still the `` tidal tail '' is present , but due to its low surface brightness , we did not attempt to estimate a magnitude of that feature .",
    "there is only one more galaxy within 11  ( 50 kpc ) of the bl lac ( b , = 23.1 ) .",
    "* 1es 1959 + 650 * : this is the closest bl lac of our targets ( z = 0.048 , p96 , schachter et al . 1993 ) .",
    "we secured a very good image under excellent seeing conditions ( 0.67  fwhm ) .",
    "the modeling of the host was slightly difficult due to a presence of a bright star 10  to the northwest .",
    "none of our 6 different models fitted to the image gave satisfactorily results .",
    "alternatively , we fitted a 3 component model consisting of a core , a disk and a bulge ( with @xmath14 free and pa equal for disk and bulge ) . in all cases , we had residuals close to the core as well as in the outer parts of the host galaxy left .    a careful inspection of our image of 1es 1959 + 650 before and after the subtraction of our models showed always a highly interesting feature ( a hint of this feature is already visible on the original frame ) .",
    "approximately 1  to the north of the center of 1es 1959 + 650 there is an absorption feature roughly oriented along the major@xmath0axis of the host galaxy in e@xmath0w direction , suggestive of a dust lane ( indicated in fig .",
    "1d with an arrow ) .",
    "if this could be confirmed , we would have found the first bl lac hosted by a dust@xmath0lane elliptical galaxy with an underlying disk !",
    "we masked the absorption feature and repeated the fitting procedure as described above .",

    "however , best fits are obtained with either the model with core and @xmath13 = 0.41 or with core and bulge and disk . for the latter we obtained = 15.2 for the core , = 15.0 and = 10.2  ( 13.5 kpc ) for the bulge and = 16.7 and = 4.8  ( 6.3 kpc ) for the disk .",

    "although we masked the absorption feature carefully , the residuals close to the center and in the outer parts of the host galaxy are still strong as compared to the other sources modeled . for the former we checked the quality of our psf by subtracting a scaled version of it from different stars on different locations on the ccd frame and found always a very good match , except the inner 2 pixels .",
    "the residuals close to the center could still be a remnant of imperfect masking .    for the residuals in the outer part of the host galaxy",
    ", the absorption feature can not be the reason alone .",
    "in fact , our isophotal analysis ( absorption feature masked ) shows that in 1es 1959 + 650 an isophote twist is occurring .",
    "the pa changes from @xmath21 at r = 3up to @xmath22 at r = 15  and @xmath14 changes from 0.2 to 0 .",
    "basically , two scenarios could be responsible for our residuals and the observed change of pa and @xmath14 .",
    "either the disk and bulge have not only different ellipticities , but also different pa , or the whole galaxy ( @xmath13 = 0.41 ) or at least the bulge ( in the 3 component fit ) is triaxial ( benacchio & galletta , 1980 ) .",
    "isophote twists can also be produced by interaction between galaxies ( madejsky , 1990 ) .",
    "there are only three brighter galaxies on the full frame 24 , 37  and 55  to the southeast , south and northeast , respectively ( 31 , 49 and 73 kpc at z = 0.048 with = 20.0 , 18.4 and 20.1 , the closest labeled a in fig .",

    "the first remark from the simulations is that in all 7 objects most of the uncertainty in @xmath13 ( and m@xmath31 , m@xmath32 and as well ) comes from the uncertainty in the sky level ; photon and readout noise have less effect on @xmath13 in the s / n conditions present in our images .",
    "also , the fitted values were scattered symmetrically around their true values showing that no bias is introduced by the fitting program .",
    "the sensitivity to assumed sky level emphasizes the importance of accurate sky subtraction if one wants to obtain correct host galaxy parameters .",

    ", @xmath33 = 0.01 ) the fitted @xmath13 lies outside the 99% confidence interval . in 1es 2037 + 521 ( @xmath13 = 0.20",
    ", @xmath33 = 0.02 ) the fitted @xmath13 lies inside the 99% but outside the 95% interval .",
    "thus we have evidence of @xmath13 significantly different from 0.25 in two objects and marginal evidence in one object . because we have not included the psf errors in our simulations , the confidence intervals we calculate have to be regarded as lower limits .",
    "thus 1es 2037 + 521 might move inside the 95% limits after including the psf errors , whereas the results for 1es1255 + 244 and especially 1es 1959 + 650 are more secure in this respect .",
    "the results of our simulations may shed new light on the morphology of bl lac host galaxies , although the amount of data is small .",
    "most previous studies used either pure de vaucouleurs or disk - type fits to determine their nature . in their 2@xmath0dimensional analysis of bl lac host galaxies from the 1 jy sample stickel et al .",
    "( 1993 ) left @xmath13 as a free parameter , but did not convolve the galaxy models .",
    "it is nevertheless remarkable that according to their result the host galaxy of bl lac itself can best be fitted by @xmath13 = 0.66 in the r - band . with the current availability of large telescopes offering excellent seeing conditions and sufficient resolution in combination with a dedicated 2@xmath0dimensional analysis , we can now determine the fraction of bl lac objects , whose host galaxies do not follow a pure de vaucouleurs law .",
    "the data obtained during the hst snap survey on bl lac objects are perfectly suited for this kind of work .    given the large residuals after subtraction of our model ( convolved de vaucouleurs + core ) and the results from our numerical simulations , 1es 1959 + 650 seems to be hosted by the most peculiar galaxy among the bl lac objects we observed .",
    "both a fit with @xmath13 = 0.41 and a fit with a bulge and a disk for the host galaxy gave best results .",
    "at present we can not distinguish which of our models represents the true nature of the morphology of the host galaxy of 1es 1959 + 650 .",
    "caon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found in their study of a sample of elliptical and s0 galaxies a wide range of @xmath13 , with basically no difference between both galaxy types , whereas capaccioli et al .",
    "( 1992 ) noted that most early@xmath0type galaxies have disks .",
    "so far , only one bl lac object has been found to be hosted by an elliptical galaxy with a disk ( pks 0548@xmath0322 ; falomo et al .",
    "1995 ) , but in this case the disk was very small .",
    "there are also claims that a few bl lac objects might be hosted by a disk@xmath0type galaxy ( abraham et al .",
    "1992 , wurtz et al .",
    "1997 ) , some of them are discussed controversary ( e.g. pks 1413 + 135 , wurtz et al . 1997 and",
    "references therein ) .",
    "in 1es 1959 + 650 we found also an indication for a dust@xmath0lane , which would be the first ever seen in any bl lac host .",
    "this is not unusual for elliptical or disk@xmath0type galaxies .",
    "mllenhoff et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found 21 out of 26 dust@xmath0lane elliptical galaxies to be radio emitters , 6 out of their 7 objects with unresolved radio structure are major@xmath0axis dust@xmath0lane elliptical galaxies .",
    "since 1es 1959 + 650 appeared unresolved at 6 cm ( p96 ) our findings would be consistent with their results .",
    "unfortunately , this indication of a dust lane is based on measurements in one passband only .",
    "multicolour images ( e.g. in b band , where the dust lane should show up clearly and in the nir , where the dust lane should not show up at all ) are needed to verify the presence of a dust lane .        so far only a couple of bl lac objects have been reported to show clear evidence of interaction with other galaxies . in both , ap lib and 3c 371 , a companion galaxy at projected distances of 110 and 83 kpc , respectively , have been found .",
    "whereas the former was characterized by asymmetric isophotes elongated towards the companion , the latter shows a tidal tail connecting both galaxies ( arp 1970 ; stickel et al . 1993 ; nilsson et al .",
    "spectroscopy by stickel et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and pesce et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found the companion galaxies at the same redshift as the bl lac thus confirming their physical association .",
    "striking evidence for interaction has been found in pks 0548@xmath0322 ( falomo et al .",
    "a relatively bright companion galaxy separated by 25 kpc from the bl lac was detected , with signs of interaction present via extended low surface brightness emission .",
    "unfortunately , no redshift for this galaxy is known yet .",
    "a similar object to pks 0548@xmath0322 is 1e 1415.6 + 2557 .",
    "halpern et al .",
    "( 1986 ) noted a close , bright companion separated by 5  ( 26 kpc in our cosmology ) from the bl lac .",
    "no redshift of the companion is known .",
    "even more close , a jet - like feature 3  ( 15 kpc ) from the bl lac was detected by romanishin ( 1992 ) , who interpreted this feature as an optical jet .",
    "this is still under debate , e.g. gladders et al .",
    "( 1997 ) interpreted this feature rather as an inclined spiral in projection against the bl lac or a nearby companion galaxy .    in two ( perhaps three ) of our",
    "bl lac objects we found evidence for interaction .",
    "1es 1440 + 122 has a close early@xmath0type companion ( projected distance @xmath6 2.5 ) with a brightness differing only by 0.2mag from that of the bl lac host .",
    "if both objects would be at the same redshift , their cores would be separated by @xmath6 9.5 kpc only !",
    "we found strong support for the interactions hypothesis by our isophotal analysis , which shows a clear isophote twist in the companion along with strongly varying ellipticity .",
    "the relatively undisturbed appearance of both galaxies suggests that they are currently approaching rather than having already undergone a close encounter .",
    "the other source showing evidence of interaction was 1es 1853 + 671 .",
    "similarly to 1es 1440 + 122 we found a close companion ( projected distance @xmath6 2  = 9.4 kpc at z = 0.212 ) , but @xmath6 3.7 mag fainter than the host of 1es 1853 + 671 . in this case , however , there is a faint extension from the companion extending @xmath6 7  to the opposite side of the bl lac .",
    "this feature is very similar to tidal tails in interacting galaxies and a similar scenario is suggested here .",
    "contrary to 1es 1440 + 122 , the optical appearance suggests , that the objects already had one close encounter , during which material was stripped off the companion .",
    "this system is similar to pks 0548@xmath0322 and its close companion , but in the latter case the projected distance is 25 kpc .",
    "another source , which might be influenced by interaction is 1es 1745 + 504 , although the evidence is weak .",
    "this source has a faint feature to the north .",
    "after the subtraction of the model for the bl lac , this feature seems to be quite round and ( perhaps ) separated .",
    "thus we believe that this is rather a galaxy well separated from the bl lac than an interacting system .    in summary , although this is just now tentative , our results imply that tidal interactions are potentially important to the bl lac phenomenon at least in some sources .",
    "1es 1440 + 122 and 1es 1853 + 671 may represent the extremes of this phenomenon ( approaching , but already very close galaxies for the former and undergone interaction for the latter ) .",
    "clearly , this issue has to be tested by very deep high@xmath0resolution imaging using hst and by spectroscopy from ground using large telescopes .",
    "already falomo et al .",
    "( 1990 ) noted close ( @xmath45 ) , faint ( @xmath34mag ) emission features around a couple of bl lac objects .",
    "since then a few studies related to this subject have been carried through both , imaging and spectroscopy ( e.g. stickel et al . 1993 ; pesce et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ; falomo et al . 1995 ; falomo 1996 ; jannuzi et al .",
    "whereas the imaging data allowed one to identify close companions for almost all of the objects , their physical association could only be confirmed for some of them .",
    "this is mainly due to their faintness as compared to the bl lac and their close separation , which makes it hard to measure their redshifts even with large telescopes .    in all of our bl lac objects @xmath0 except 1es 2037 + 521",
    "@xmath0 we found at least 2 companions within a projected distance of @xmath6 60 kpc .",
    "most companions were found around 1es 1440 + 122 and 1es 1745 + 504 ( 5 within 30 kpc and 6 within 60 kpc , respectively ) .",
    "1es 2326 + 174 has 6 companions within 100 kpc , three of them within 30 kpc projected distance .",
    "they span a wide range of brightnesses , between = 17 and 23.5 . whereas some of the companions are most likely projected along the line of sight to the bl lac ( e.g. in 1es 1745 + 504 ) , and the faintest ones background galaxies , most of them could well be at the same redshift as the bl lac , or at least members of the putative cluster surrounding the bl lac .    these observations ( and those reported in sect .",
    "5.2.1 ) point to the fact that interaction might be related to the bl lac phenomenon as seems to be the case for qsos ( e.g. hutchings & neff 1992 ; bahcall et al .",
    "1995 ; miller 1998 ) . that this is generally the case , has not yet been convincingly demonstrated .",
    "one possible test would be a study of a well defined , low redshift sample of bl lac objects , fr i radio galaxies ( the assumed parent population of bl lac objects ) _ and _ a control sample of `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "the samples must well be matched in redshift and luminosity space . since both",
    ", imaging and spectroscopy is needed for such a program ( imaging for the number and luminosity distribution of the companions , spectroscopy to check their physical association ) , this would be a project requiring a lot of telescope time on ( very ) large telescopes . and even when it could be shown that the samples of active galaxies have e.g. on average more frequent and brighter companions at the same redshift as the control sample of `` normal '' galaxies , its not clear if every possible bias is taken into account .",
    "for example , the proper selection of the control sample is very difficult , because it should be chosen in such a way that it is not only well matched in redshift and luminosity distribution with the samples of active galaxies , but should also have the same mix of large@xmath0scale surroundings ( cluster environments ) .",
    "we have presented the first images of 7 newly detected bl lac objects ( among them one bl lac candidate ) from the einstein slew survey .",
    "since they are at low redshift and thanks to our excellent resolution , we could resolve their hosts in all cases .",
    "this allowed us to analyze the host galaxies , to study their properties by a 2@xmath0dimensional decomposition method and to investigate their environment .",
    "the properties of the host galaxies are very similar to those derived for other bl lac objects .",
    "they are luminous @xmath6 @xmath023.1 and large @xmath6 10 kpc elliptical galaxies .",
    "the host of 1es 1959 + 650 is complex and may be either an elliptical galaxy with @xmath13 = 0.41 or an elliptical ( @xmath13 = 0.25 ) galaxy with an underlying disk .",
    "based on the average properties of the bl lac hosts with firm redshift , we estimated a redshift of 0.45 for the bl lac candidate 1es 1745 + 504 and a redshift of 0.05 for 1es 2037 + 521 .",
    "we searched for deviations of a pure de vaucouleurs law ( @xmath35 0.25 ) in the host galaxies of our bl lac objects and determined their statistical significance with numerical simulations . in two objects ( 1es 1255 + 244 , 1es 1959 + 650 ) we found significant deviations .",
    "this may shed new light on the properties of the host galaxies of bl lac objects , but due to the small number observations an analysis of a large sample of bl lac objects is required .",
    "the environments of the bl lac objects are highly interesting .",
    "we found in at least two ( perhaps three ) cases evidence for interaction ( 1es 1440 + 122 , 1es 1853 + 671 and perhaps 1es 1745 + 504 ) . in all except one cases we found at least 2 companions within a projected distance of 60 kpc around the bl lac . in two cases we found at least 5 within 50 kpc ( 1es 1440 + 122 , 1es 1745 + 504 )",
    "this may show that interaction is potentially important to bl lac phenomenon at least in these sources .",
