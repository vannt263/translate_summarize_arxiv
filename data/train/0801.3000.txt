    "taste - breaking is a major concern for practical applications of staggered fermions . for",
    "standard methods to work ( including the rooting procedure used for dynamical fermions ) taste - breaking must vanish in the continuum limit . at non - zero lattice spacing ,",
    "taste - breaking is present , and leads to complications in interpreting and fitting the results .",
    "it is therefore important to find variants of the staggered action for which taste - breaking is reduced . in this article",
    "we study one particularly simple approach , hypercubic ( hyp ) smearing  @xcite , using numerical simulations to determine the size of non - perturbative taste - breaking , and comparing with other types of staggered fermions .    the hyp - smeared staggered action ( which we sometimes call the `` hyp action '' for short ) is obtained by inserting hyp - smeared links in the unimproved staggered action .",
    "hyp smearing of links was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as a compact smearing approach , and has turned out to be a practical and efficacious in several applications .",
    "we do not repeat the definition of hyp smearing here , except to note that key aspects are that it involves multiple ( 3 level ) smearing and includes reunitarization at each step . for more discussion of these and other aspects of hyp smearing ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hyp action is not an @xmath2 improved action in the sense of symanzik  @xcite : while taste - breaking @xmath5 four - fermion operators are removed at tree - level , taste - conserving tree - level @xmath5 contributions to the quark - gluon vertices and the quark propagator remain . in this respect",
    "it is inferior to the widely - used asqtad action  @xcite , which is tree - level @xmath2 improved .",
    "there is considerable numerical evidence , however , that the dominant @xmath2 effects are those due to the taste - breaking four - fermion operators , and here the hyp action has an advantage .",
    "the multiple smearing in the hyp action leads to couplings between quarks and gluons with momenta @xmath6 that are suppressed for a larger range of gluon momenta and polarizations than in the asqtad action . because of this one expects taste - breaking to continue to be suppressed beyond tree - level with the hyp action . indeed , in a recent calculation ,",
    "@xcite finds that the coefficients of taste - breaking four - fermion operators induced at one - loop are an order of magnitude smaller for the hyp than for the asqtad action . in other words ,",
    "the hyp action turns out to be approximately one - loop @xmath2 improved for taste - breaking effects .",
    "this property , coupled with simplicity , are the main reasons why we think it interesting to study the hyp action .",
    "it should also be noted that one can have both tree - level @xmath2 improvement _ and _ approximate one - loop improvement of taste - breaking effects .",
    "this is accomplished by the hisq ( `` highly improved staggered quark '' ) action  @xcite .",
    "this action also includes a tuning of the naik term which removes the leading @xmath7 error at tree - level , thus reducing the discretization errors for heavy quarks .",
    "this makes it the method of choice for simulating the charm quark with staggered fermions . for light quarks , however , which are our interest",
    ", the lack of complete tree - level @xmath2 improvement may not be so important in practice , as long as the dominant taste - breaking effects are reduced .",
    "in particular , the remaining @xmath2 errors are of the same parametric size as those for non - perturbatively @xmath8 improved wilson and maximally - twisted fermions , both of which are being used for large scale simulations . of course , the key practical issue is the relative numerical size of the @xmath2 errors , and we return to this point in the conclusions .",
    "a further advantage of the hyp action is that it avoids another well - known problem with unimproved staggered fermions  the large size of the one - loop contributions to matching factors .",
    "for example , perturbation theory for @xmath9 , the mass renormalization factor , is very poorly convergent with unimproved staggered fermions .",
    "this is solved by any type of link smearing which reduces the tree - level taste - breaking four - fermion operators , and thus by both hyp and asqtad actions  @xcite ( and , presumably , by the hisq action too ) .",
    "this reduction has been observed also for four - fermion operators with the hyp action  @xcite .    with these considerations as motivation , we have undertaken a thorough study of how hyp smearing reduces taste - breaking in non - perturbative quantities .",
    "the perturbative improvements described above are important , but , if the hyp action is to be phenomenologically useful , one must also show that non - perturbative taste - breaking is reduced . to do this we study the splittings in the pion multiplet .",
    "this measure of taste - breaking has several advantages .",
    "first , very accurate calculations are possible , allowing small effects to be picked out .",
    "second , it is known from previous studies that the splittings between pions are larger than those between states of other spin - parities ( e.g. the vector mesons or baryons ) . and , third , pion taste - breaking feeds into all quantities , since the masses of pions of all tastes enter the non - analytic `` chiral logarithmic '' terms which occur in generic chiral expansions",
    ".    it will be useful to recall the pattern of taste - splittings within the pion multiplet .",
    "the four tastes of staggered fermions lead to 16 tastes of flavor non - singlet pions .",
    "these have the spin - taste structure @xmath10 with @xmath11\\}$ ] .",
    "for zero spatial momentum ( which is the case we study numerically ) these states fall into 8 irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the lattice timeslice group  @xcite , with tastes @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "that with taste @xmath20 is the goldstone pion corresponding to the axial symmetry which is exact when @xmath21 , and is broken spontaneously .",
    "the properties of the pion spectrum can be studied using staggered chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , at leading order in a joint expansion in @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the pion spectrum respects an so(4 ) subgroup of the full su(4 ) taste symmetry .",
    "in other words , the taste symmetry breaking happens in two steps : at @xmath24 the su(4 ) taste symmetry is broken down to so(4 ) , while at @xmath1 the so(4 ) taste symmetry is broken down to the discrete spin - taste symmetry @xmath25  @xcite . as a consequence of this analysis",
    ", we expect that , to good approximation , the pions will lie in 5 irreps of so(4 ) taste symmetry , with tastes @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "a secondary motivation for this work is that the masses of pions of all tastes are needed in our companion calculation of @xmath29 and related matrix elements . in particular , in staggered chiral perturbation theory loop contributions from non - goldstone pions ( those with @xmath30 ) is much larger than that from the goldstone pions  @xcite .",
    "thus we also use this work to test different choices of sources and sinks .",
    "previous studies have shown that link smearing leads to substantial reduction in the splittings in the pion multiplet compared to the unimproved staggered action  @xcite .",
    "other features of the action , and in particular whether it is fully @xmath2 improved at tree - level , have little effect on these splittings .",
    "for example , the splittings are reduced similarly by the asqtad action ( which contains the naik term ) and the smeared p4 action ( which contains the `` knight s move '' term  @xcite )  @xcite .",
    "the type of smearing used is , however , important .",
    "hyp smearing ( or the double - smearing used in the hisq action ) has been found to be significantly more effective than that used in the asqtad action .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite finds that the pion taste splittings , in the chiral limit .",
    "we use this measure below . ]",
    "are reduced by about a factor of two when using the hyp ( or hisq ) action compared to the asqtad action , on quenched lattices with @xmath31fm .",
    "our aim in this paper is to confirm and extend previous studies of hyp smearing .",
    "we focus on two aspects .",
    "first , a study of the impact of smearing on the relative size of different contributions in the joint chiral - continuum expansion .",
    "we are particularly interested in the appropriate power - counting to use for valence hyp smeared staggered fermions . and , second , a detailed comparison with asqtad fermions , using lattices with light dynamical sea quarks ( which are the lattices we are using to calculate phenomenologically important quantities ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "the next two sections describe some technicalities of our calculation .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : cubic ]",
    ", we explain how we project onto representations of the timeslice group using `` cubic sources '' .",
    "second , in sec .  [",
    "sec : op ] , we describe how we construct sink operators using two different methods , and give examples of the fitting of pion correlators .",
    "we then turn to our numerical results .",
    "sections  [ sec : pion : unimp ] and [ sec : pion : hyp ] present , respectively , the pion spectrum calculated using unimproved and hyp - smeared fermions on quenched lattices , by comparing which we study the impact of hyp smearing on taste - breaking , and the nature of the chiral - continuum expansion . section  [ sec : cmp : asqtad - hyp ] contains our central results : a comparison of asqtad and hyp - smeared valence fermions calculated on @xmath32 flavor dynamical lattices .",
    "we close with some conclusions .",
    "an appendix discusses the decomposition of hypercubic sink operators into timeslice representations .",
    "preliminary results from this work were presented in ref .",
    "in order to select a specific pion taste we must choose sources and sinks that lie in irreps of the time - slice group .",
    "here we discuss how this is done for the sources .",
    "we consider only sources with vanishing physical three - momentum .",
    "we adopt two different methods , which we label the `` cubic u(1 ) '' and the `` cubic wall '' sources .",
    "both are fairly standard  @xcite but , for completeness , we describe them briefly . at the end",
    "we discuss their relative merits .",
    "we first fix the configurations to coulomb gauge .",
    "propagators are obtained , as usual , by solving the dirac equation with source @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the point - to - point quark propagator , @xmath36 label lattice sites , and @xmath37 are color indices .",
    "the cubic u(1 ) source at timeslice @xmath38 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a vector labeling @xmath41 cubes in the timeslice , @xmath42 labels points within the cubes , and @xmath43 is a @xmath44 noise vector normalized so that @xmath45 with @xmath46 the number of random vectors . in practice",
    "we use only a single noise vector on each configuration . note that the noise vector is the same irrespective of the position in the cube , but differs from cube to cube , and color to color .",
    "the cubic wall source differs by having the same noise vector on all cubes , varying only from color to color : @xmath47 there are eight sources of each type , depending on the choice of @xmath48 . by combining these",
    "appropriately , one can project onto irreps of the timeslice group .",
    "this works as follows ( using cubic u(1 ) sources and @xmath49 for illustration ) .",
    "suppose that we want to select a state with spin - taste @xmath50 .",
    "we calculate propagators from all eight sources , and then combine them using the spin - taste matrix  @xcite @xmath51 ( where , following ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath52 , etc . , ) in the following way : @xmath53,b ) \\eta^{*}(\\vec{n},b ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{2pc } \\sum_{\\vec{m},\\vec{b},d } g(y , c;[0,2\\vec{m}+\\vec{b}],d ) \\eta(\\vec{m},d ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{2pc } \\epsilon(x ) \\epsilon(\\vec{a } )   ( \\overline { \\gamma_s \\otimes \\xi_f } ) _ { \\vec{b } , \\vec{a } }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\sum_{\\vec{n},\\vec{a},\\vec{b},b } g^{*}(x , a;[0,2\\vec{n}+\\vec{a}],b )   g(y , c;[0,2\\vec{n}+\\vec{b}],b ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{2pc } \\epsilon(x ) \\epsilon(\\vec{a } ) ( \\overline { \\gamma_s \\otimes \\xi_f } ) _ { \\vec{b } , \\vec{a } }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\sum_{\\vec{n},\\vec{a},\\vec{b},b } g(y , c;[0,2\\vec{n}+\\vec{b}],b )   ( \\overline { \\gamma_s \\otimes \\xi_f } ) _ { \\vec{b } , \\vec{a } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{2pc } g([0,2\\vec{n}+\\vec{a}],b;x , a)\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : src : op}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factors of @xmath54 are needed to hermitian - conjugate the second propagator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : src : op ] ) .",
    "as one can see , the final result is the insertion of a bilinear operator at the source , with quark and antiquark fields spread out over a @xmath41 cube , made gauge invariant by the choice of coulomb gauge , and projected onto zero three - momentum .",
    "the sum over @xmath55 and @xmath56 picks out a bilinear lying in a particular time - slice representation .",
    "in fact , this is not quite correct , because the division of the timeslice into a particular set of @xmath41 cubes breaks the single - site translation symmetry .",
    "a similar issue arises for the sinks , and is discussed in more detail in the following section and in appendix  [ app : anatomy ] .",
    "the upshot is that the cubic u(1 ) source couples most strongly to the pion with the desired taste , but has an additional coupling to spin - scalar states with different tastes ( and which live in a different irreps of the timeslice group ) .    this issue does not arise for the cubic wall sources  @xcite . here",
    "the bilinear that one is inserting at the source is constructed by first summing the fields at a particular position in the cubes over the timeslice , and then combining them into the desired spin - taste .",
    "this projects onto a true irrep of the timeslice group .",
    "we recall that irreps of the time - slice group contain two types of states  @xcite : those which propagate in time with an alternating sign @xmath57 , and those which do not .",
    "this is related to the fact that the bilinears onto which we project in eq .",
    "( [ eq : src : op ] ) involve only a sum over a spatial cube , rather than the full @xmath58 hypercube .",
    "thus the timeslice operator couples to states with spin - taste @xmath50 and to their `` time - parity partners '' with spin - taste @xmath59 , the latter propagating with an alternating sign .",
    "( here we use a shorthand notation exemplified by @xmath60 . )",
    "if we are considering the pion channel then @xmath61 or @xmath62 , and the alternating state is a scalar , created respectively by @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "these `` extra '' states do not present a significant problem  their contribution is reduced relative to the desired pion signal because the scalars are heavier , and can be separated because of the different time dependence .",
    "in addition , it can be reduced by using appropriate sinks , as discussed below .",
    "a final reduction comes from the fact that operators with @xmath63 ( at zero momentum and with degenerate quarks ) do not couple to scalar states in the continuum limit since they correspond to conserved charges .",
    "while our single timeslice sources can produce pions of all tastes  @xcite , the strength of coupling to the pion is taste - dependent . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : src : op ] ) and the definition ( [ eq : kludef ] ) , single - timeslice sources imply that @xmath65 . for pions having tastes with @xmath66 ( i.e. tastes @xmath20 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , the corresponding spin matrix is thus @xmath70 , while for those with @xmath71 ( tastes @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) , the spin matrix is @xmath76 .",
    "we label the former tastes lt ( for `` local in time '' ) and the latter nlt ( `` non - local in time''because the corresponding bilinear with the preferred spin @xmath70 involves quark and antiquarks on different timeslices ) . in the continuum limit ,",
    "operators with spin @xmath62 have an overlap with the state that is suppressed by @xmath77 compared to that for spin @xmath70 , where @xmath78 is a qcd scale that turns out to be large .",
    "thus we expect that our sources are less efficient at producing nlt pions than the lt pions .",
    "the two sources we use represent two extremes : the cubic u(1 ) source corresponds to using a local bilinear ( local at the scale of a hypercube ) summed over the time - slice , while the cubic wall source gives rise to a bilinear composed of quarks and antiquarks which are separately spread out across the entire time - slice .",
    "the relative efficacy of the sources depends on several factors : which has a better overlap with the desired pion , and smaller overlap with excited pions and unwanted scalars ; which is more effective at reducing the noise due to the u(1 ) random vectors ; and whether additional noise is introduced by the fact that the cubic source is not a true irrep of the timeslice group . in the absence of any clear theoretical argument favoring one source over the other",
    ", we study the issue numerically .",
    "we use two different methods to construct bilinear operators at the sink : the `` hypercube '' or hpc method  @xcite and the `` golterman method ''  @xcite . in the former , the bilinear operators ( at zero spatial momentum ) are @xmath79 where @xmath80 labels @xmath58 hypercubes straddling timeslices @xmath38 and @xmath81 , with their origins at @xmath82 , while @xmath83 and @xmath84 are now vectors in the full hypercube . we stress that these hpc sinks always run over two timeslices , even when the operator is local in time . they are made gauge invariant by fixing each timeslice to coulomb gauge , so that spatial links are not required , and inserting appropriate time - directed links if @xmath85 .",
    "more precisely , we average over the insertion of the time - directed link at the position of the quark and of the antiquark .",
    "the links that are inserted are hyp - smeared when we are using hyp - smeared fermions .    in the golterman method , we follow the construction of ref .",
    "for example , if @xmath65 , so that the bilinear is local in time , it is defined as @xmath86 \\chi(x ) \\\\ & & \\phi_\\mu \\,\\chi(x ) = \\frac{1}{2 } \\big [ \\chi(x + \\hat{\\mu } ) + \\chi(x - \\hat{\\mu } ) \\big ] \\label{eq : phimudef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is a phase factor given in ref .",
    "gauge invariance is maintained as for the hpc operators .",
    "note that these are single timeslice operators , unlike the corresponding hpc operators , which are spread over two timeslices ( even though the terms contributing do not involve time links ) .",
    "if @xmath85 , the operators necessarily involve two timeslices , and are constructed following the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite , which we do not repeat here .",
    "time - directed gauge links added as for the hpc operators .",
    "the hpc method is , perhaps , conceptually simpler , but gives bilinears that are only approximate representations of the timeslice group , whereas the golterman method has the advantage of giving true irreps  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the hpc operators include the golterman operators as the leading term in an expansion in @xmath89 , with subleading contributions containing derivatives and having different spin - tastes .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in appendix [ app : anatomy ] .",
    "one thus expects the hpc sinks to lead to noisier results with more contamination from other states , particularly for the cubic u(1 ) sources which have a similar coupling to additional representations .",
    "we study this issue numerically in the next section .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the pions can be divided into those having `` lt tastes '' , which can be created by sources with the preferred choice @xmath61 , and those with `` nlt tastes '' , for which we must use sources with @xmath76 . at the sink end , we always choose @xmath61 , so that the bilinears used for the lt pions are local in time , while those used for the nlt pions are non - local in time .",
    "we now briefly describe our fitting method and give examples of the quality of our data . for the pions with lt tastes ,",
    "the sink and source have the same spin - taste , so that the two - point correlation functions have positive time - reflection parity .",
    "thus we fit the data to the following form : @xmath90 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & z_2 ( -1)^t [ \\exp(-m_2 t)\\ ! + \\",
    "! \\exp(-m_2(l_t\\!-\\!t ) ) ]   \\label{eq : ltform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the lattice size in the time direction . the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 describe the pion contribution ( spin - taste @xmath94 ) , while @xmath95 and @xmath96 describe their time - parity partners ( with spin - taste @xmath97 ) . in this study",
    "we are concerned only with the pion spectrum , and so do not include excited states in the fit function , but rather begin fits at times large enough that the form ( [ eq : ltform ] ) is adequate . the typical fitting range is @xmath98 , with the source at @xmath49 .",
    "we use uncorrelated fits ( i.e. keeping only the diagonal components of the correlation matrix ) , with errors estimated by the jackknife method .",
    "we show an example of the data for lt pions in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - mass : s5xt4 ] .    , for hyp - smeared staggered fermions , cubic u(1 ) sources ( at @xmath49 ) , and hpc sinks .",
    "the fit is discussed in the text .",

    ".simulation parameters for quenched study of unimproved staggered fermions . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we next compare taste - breaking for hyp - smeared fermions between the quenched lattices considered earlier and the dynamical lattices .",
    "clearly , the splittings are significantly larger for the latter . to make this quantitative we compare the splittings in physical units in table  [ tab : cmp : all ] , where we see that they are 2 - 2.5 larger on the unquenched than on the quenched lattices with hyp - smeared fermions .",
    "can we understand this ?",
    "the answer is yes , at least qualitatively .",
    "taste - breaking is expected to scale as @xmath107 , since the contributions from one - gluon exchange have been removed .",
    "the lattice spacing on the dynamical lattices is larger , with the ratio of @xmath23 to that on the quenched lattices being about 1.5 .",
    "we also know that @xmath108 at a scale of @xmath109 ( which is the scale relevant for taste - breaking gluon vertices ) is larger on the dynamical lattices , since the long - distance physics has been ( approximately ) matched by construction , and the coupling runs toward zero more slowly for the dynamical lattices . combining these effects , we expect to find that the taste - breaking for hyp - smeared fermions is perhaps twice as large on the dynamical as on the quenched lattices .",
    "this is in accord with our results .",
    "note , however , that @xmath107 is reduced by about a factor of 2.5 between the milc coarse and fine lattices  @xcite .",
    "thus we expect the taste - splitting on the milc fine lattices with the hyp - action to be similar to that we observed above on the @xmath110fm quenched lattices .    in summary ,",
    "the main difference between asqtad and hyp - smeared valence quarks is a substantial reduction in the lo taste - breaking splittings between so(4 ) multiplets . unlike the quenched case studied above",
    ", however , the power - counting @xmath111 appears to remain necessary on these coarse milc lattices .",
    "it seems likely , however , that taste - breaking will be a nlo effect with hyp - smeared quarks on the fine milc lattices .",
    "in this paper , we have compared three versions of staggered fermions ",
    "unimproved , hyp - smeared , and asqtad  from the standpoint of taste - symmetry breaking .",
    "we confirm and make quantitative the hierarchy expected from previous work , namely that hyp smearing is significantly more effective at reducing taste - breaking than asqtad improvement .",
    "this is summarized in table  [ tab : cmp : all ] .",
    "our results imply that hyp - smeared valence fermions on the fine milc lattices ( with @xmath112fm ) should have taste - breaking small enough that it will be possible to treat discretization errors as a nlo effect in chiral perturbation theory ( rather than as a lo effect as required with asqtad fermions , and with hyp - smeared fermions on the coarse milc lattices ) .",
    "this is an encouraging result for our ongoing calculations of electroweak matrix elements using hyp - smeared valence fermions . to put the results into context ,",
    "it is useful to convert the size of the splittings into a scale characterizing discretization errors . taking the splitting of the 2-link lt pion ( taste @xmath113 ) as indicative of an `` average '' splitting , and setting @xmath114",
    ", we find @xmath115 and @xmath116mev for hyp fermions on the quenched and unquenched lattices , respectively",
    ". these are scales within the range of sizes that one would expect for generic discretization errors . in other words , the improvement due to hyp smearing brings the taste - breaking errors down into the range expected of generic discretization errors , so that discretization errors with staggered fermion are no longer anomalously large .",

    "then the following identity holds : @xmath129 \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\sum_{\\vec n }",
    "[ \\phi_\\mu \\bar{\\chi}(b ) ] ( \\overline{\\gamma_s \\otimes \\xi_f } ) _ { ab }",
    "\\chi(b ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\equiv   [ \\sum_{\\vec n } \\bar{\\chi } ( \\overline{\\gamma_s \\otimes \\xi_f } ) \\chi]_t \\label{eq : truerep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130_t$ ] indicates that this is part of an irrep of the timeslice group of ref .  @xcite . in fact , if @xmath119 is a spatial index , the @xmath130_t$ ] part of the hpc operator is identical to the corresponding golterman operator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : goltdef ] ) .",
    "if @xmath131 , the operator in ( [ eq : truerep ] ) transforms in the same irrep as the corresponding golterman operator , although it is not identical .    to pick out the remaining parts of the hpc operator , we define , as in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath132 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{1pc } - [ d_\\mu \\bar{\\chi}(b ) ] ( \\overline{\\gamma_{\\mu 5 s } \\otimes \\xi_{\\mu 5 f } } ) _ { ab } \\chi(b)\\big\\}\\ , . \\label{eq : app : d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this also transforms as part of an irrep of the timeslice group [ a different irrep from that in which the operator ( eq .  [ eq : truerep ] ) transforms , unless @xmath131 ] .",
    "thus we can express the hpc operator as a sum of two true representations : @xmath134_t \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\vec n}\\bar{\\chi } ( \\overline{\\gamma_{\\mu 5 s } \\otimes \\xi_{\\mu 5 f } } ) \\overleftrightarrow{d}_\\mu \\chi \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that for @xmath131 these two operators , while having different spin - taste , lie in the same irrep of the timeslice group .",
    "this is the standard `` doubling '' of states discussed in the text .",
    "the extension to operators containing more than one link is straightforward .",
    "for example , for distance two operators ( _ i.e. _ @xmath135 for @xmath136 , and @xmath137 for @xmath138 ) , we find : @xmath139_t \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\vec n}\\bar{\\chi } ( \\overline{\\gamma_{\\mu 5 s } \\otimes \\xi_{\\mu 5 f } } ) \\overleftrightarrow{d}_\\mu \\phi_\\nu \\chi \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\vec n}\\bar{\\chi } ( \\overline{\\gamma_{\\nu 5 s } \\otimes \\xi_{\\nu 5 f } } ) \\overleftrightarrow{d}_\\nu \\phi_\\mu \\chi \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{\\vec n}\\bar{\\chi } ( \\overline{\\gamma_{\\mu \\nu s } \\otimes \\xi_{\\mu \\nu f } } ) \\overleftrightarrow{d}_\\mu \\overleftrightarrow{d}_\\nu \\chi   \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus there are four irreps ( all different if @xmath140 ) contained in the hpc operator .",
    "in general , the hpc operator includes the golterman operator ( or , if @xmath141 , an operator in the same irrep ) as the leading term as well as operators with derivatives having different spin - taste .",
    "one expects the latter to have a coupling to physical states suppressed by @xmath142 for each derivative .",
    "a similar analysis holds for the cubic u(1 ) sources , while the cubic wall sources should produce only true irreps aside from the effects of using only a few noise vectors .",
    "one should also keep in mind that the symmetries are not completely implemented when one has a finite ensemble of gauge configurations , although we expect this effect to be smaller than the use of only one source - set per configuration .",
    "thus we expect the contamination from coupling to states of unwanted spin - taste to be smallest for the combination `` golterman - wall '' , followed by `` golterman - u(1 ) '' , then `` hpc - wall '' , and finally `` hpc - u(1 ) '' .",
    "this is not , however , the only source of systematic problems . the coupling to excited states within the same irrep should be more significant for wall than for u(1 )",
