    "when we move to processes able to generate large missing transverse energy , the sm reference values for the @xmath0 boson longitudinal polarisation @xmath74 and alignment @xmath75 present a characteristic rapid variation above 100 gev of met , contrary to the values and behaviour obtained from susy models with new sources of @xmath0 boson production like the decay of neutralinos to gravitinos . for two - body decays of a heavy particle involving a @xmath0 boson ( or @xmath1 boson ) in its decay products , we have demonstrated that different spin assignments of the parent and daughter particles lead to specific zeros and values of the @xmath0 boson polarisations and alignments .",
    "the use of these observables will increasingly become an invaluable interesting handle to test the sm predictions and look for new physics .",
