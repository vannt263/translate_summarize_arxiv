    "let us first explain the unconventional way of determining neutrino mass hierarchy , the `` @xmath0 disappearance '' method @xcite , to be explored in this paper .",
    "suppose that we measure the atmospheric @xmath0 by doing disappearance measurements of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in vacuum . for clarity ,",
    "we start with a simplified setting where the solar mixing angle @xmath23 vanishes . in this case",
    ", it is obvious that @xmath24 and @xmath25 channels are governed by @xmath26 and approximately @xmath27 , respectively , since the two oscillations scales approximately decouple from each other .",
    "notice that because @xmath28 , @xmath29 for the normal hierarchy and @xmath30 for the inverted hierarchy .",
    "therefore , in the hypothetical simplified world of vanishing @xmath23 , one could , in principle , determine the mass hierarchy just by comparing the absolute values of the two @xmath0 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    for non - zero @xmath23 ,",
    "the same considerations apply except that the difference is reduced by approximately @xmath33 . to make the discussion transparent we introduce , following @xcite , the effective atmospheric @xmath34 determined by the disappearance measurement in the @xmath35 channel .",
    "it is this effective @xmath36 , obtained by a two - flavor approximate description of the full three - flavor situation , which contains to high accuracy all the three - flavor mixing effects .",
    "let us briefly review the derivation of @xmath34 . in the approximate two - flavor mixing framework ,",
    "the survival probability is given by @xmath37 the energy @xmath38 at which @xmath39 is maximum is given by @xmath40 .",
    "now we repeat the same computation with the full three - flavor expression of the survival probability ; @xmath41 can be obtained by solving @xmath42/de = 0 $ ] . by demanding that @xmath43 , an expression for @xmath44 can be derived .",
    "assuming vacuum oscillations and ignoring the terms of the order of @xmath45 , we obtain @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 the @xmath48 s are elements of the neutrino mixing matrix @xcite , for which we use the standard parametrization @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath49 is that it is the fraction of the @xmath50 flavor in the @xmath51 eigenstate over the sum of this fraction in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 eigenstates .",
    "note that @xmath53 without further approximation and @xmath54 if @xmath55 .",
    "the difference @xmath56 of the two effective @xmath0 can be easily computed from eq .",
    "( [ dm2eff ] ) and ( [ defr ] ) to be @xmath57 where @xmath58 which is positive for small values of @xmath59 , and @xmath60 sign is for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy",
    ". implies @xmath61 .",
    "] thus the _ sign _ of @xmath62 is the same as the _ sign _ of @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , within the experimentally allowed region for the mixing parameters , the hierarchy is normal if @xmath56 is positive and inverted if @xmath56 is negative .",
    "one should be reminded that _ both _ measurements , @xmath63 and @xmath2 , have to be accurate to the 1% level at least , because @xmath64 1% for the current best fitted parameters .",
    "a more elaborate treatment in @xcite entailed a rough estimation that both accuracies must be better than 0.5% .",
    "therefore , the issue is whether one can at least envisage experimental setups capable of measuring both @xmath0 to such a high accuracy .",
    "it appears that precision determination of @xmath2 is more feasible because there exists a well known method : the spectrum measurement in the @xmath19 disappearance channel .",
    "if it can be performed with high precision , it should be possible to determine @xmath2 with great accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , there is a potential obstacle to accurate measurement of @xmath2 , the problem of _ absolute energy scale uncertainty_. for concreteness , we consider the phase ii of the t2k project ( t2k ii )  @xcite where the beam power from j - parc is upgraded to 4 mw and the far detector will be hyper - kamiokande with 0.54 mt fiducial volume . with huge number of events obtained in several years of running , the precision of @xmath2 would reach to @xmath65% level without the energy scale uncertainty @xcite .",
    "to determine @xmath0 accurately , however , we have to know precisely the absolute value of the energy of the detected muons to reconstruct the neutrino energies .",
    "since the oscillation probability depends on @xmath66 , the accuracy of @xmath2 measurement is limited by the energy scale error . at the moment",
    ", the absolute energy of muons are known to the accuracy of 2% at energies @xmath67 gev in the super - kamiokande detector  @xcite .",
    "lacking better calibration sources , one expects that the energy scale uncertainty will be the major limiting factor in improving the @xmath2 determination in the t2k ii experiment @xcite .",
    "notice that the difficulty is not specific to this experiment and similar statements would apply to other detection methods as well .    if the 2% energy scale uncertainty still remains , our method for determining the mass hierarchy would not work because then the maximum precision we can expect on @xmath2 is 2% .",
    "see appendix [ bound ] .",
    "a precision better than 1% is needed for the method discussed in this paper to be useful . in this work ,",
    "we take the optimistic attitude that this uncertainty can be reduced to the level of 0.5%-1% by the time t2k ii will be realized , or by development of alternative detection technologies .",
    "we study to what extent one can determine the mass hierarchy with the method described in the previous section .",
    "we believe that physics results we can achieve under such an assumption are worthwhile to report .    for definiteness",
    ", we assume that @xmath2 can be determined with 0.5% accuracy .",
    "we also examine the case in which the accuracy is 1% to reveal how the capability of the mass hierarchy determination depends upon the accuracy of @xmath2 .",
    "we note that due to the fact that a large oscillation effect in the @xmath68 mode is expected , the precision in the determination of @xmath2 essentially does not depend on the precise values of the unknown mixing parameters such as @xmath7 and @xmath69 , and possible deviation of @xmath70 from @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the fractional accuracy , @xmath72 can be regarded , to good approximation , as constant for a given systematic uncertainty . also , since matter effects change the size of @xmath2 by less than 0.1% they can be ignored for the t2k measurement of @xmath2 , see @xcite .",
    "most probably , the most difficult part of the method for the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy explored in this paper is to measure @xmath3 to the level of a few parts per mil .",
    "the reactor @xmath7 experiments @xcite , as they stand , will not reach the accuracy of 1% level .",
    "recently , the intriguing possibility of using the resonant absorption reaction @xcite @xmath74 to explore @xmath5 interaction below the threshold of the charged - current absorption reaction @xmath75 , has been proposed by raghavan @xcite . see ref .",
    "@xcite for earlier suggestions .",
    "the resonance condition is automatically satisfied if the @xmath5 beam is prepared with the use of the inverse reaction @xmath76 .",
    "if both , the source and the target , atoms are placed in a metal lattice and can enjoy the same environment the resonant cross section can be enhanced by the mssbauer effect by a factor of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite where some potential difficulties of this experiment are discussed . because the energy of @xmath5 from the bound state beta decay is so low , @xmath78 kev",
    ", the first oscillation maximum ( minimum of @xmath79 ) is reached at the baseline distance @xmath80 m. then , one can envisage @xmath7 experiments with @xmath8110 m baseline  @xcite . with the mssbauer enhanced cross section of @xmath82 the rate @xmath83 , with @xmath84 being the number of target atoms and @xmath85 the neutrino flux , is given by @xmath86 that is , a million events a day by using 100 g of @xmath87he target mass @xmath88 and assuming a source strength @xmath89 of 1 mci .",
    "it is natural to expect that the monochromatic nature of the @xmath5 beam as well as the extremely high statistics allow one to measure @xmath3 to a high accuracy , as demonstrated by the recent analysis in @xcite . for the purpose of the present analysis",
    ", we use one of the particular settings discussed in that paper , the one called run iib , which is defined as follows :    run iib : it consists of measurements at 10 different detector locations ; @xmath90 for @xmath91 , so that the entire period , from 0 to 2@xmath92 , is covered . at each location",
    "an equal number of @xmath93 events is to be collected .",
    "the authors of @xcite argued that if the direct counting of produced @xmath94 atoms works , a movable detector technique would allow for a relative systematic uncertainty as low as 0.2% , and if not it may be of the order of @xmath951% .",
    "if the former uncertainty is realized , a sensitivity to @xmath3 of @xmath96% at 1@xmath97 cl is possible . for the latter uncertainty ,",
    "the sensitivity is worse by about a factor of four @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider this systematic uncertainty to be 0.2% , and also discuss the case where it is 1% .",
    "given the accuracies of the measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 discussed in secs .",

    "if these two experiments will be realized , then as a special bonus , there is a possibility that the mass hierarchy can be determined , even though neither of these experiments alone can accomplish this task .",
    "existing technologies seem to allow us to realize the experiment such as the second phase of the t2k project , in which the determination of @xmath2 up to 2% precision looks quite feasible .",
    "how much one will be able to improve this precision depends essentially on how much one can reduce the energy scale uncertainty . if it can be reduced to less than 1% , then it is worthwhile to consider the method studied in this paper .    the method discussed in this paper paper , ``",

    "<S> recently a new method for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy by comparing the effective values of the atmospheric @xmath0 measured in the electron neutrino disappearance channel , @xmath1 , with the one measured in the muon neutrino disappearance channel , @xmath2 , was proposed . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath3 is larger ( smaller ) than @xmath4 the hierarchy is of the normal ( inverted ) type . </S>",
    "<S> we re - examine this proposition in the light of two very high precision measurements : @xmath2 that may be accomplished by the phase ii of the tokai - to - kamioka ( t2k ) experiment , for example , and @xmath3 that can be envisaged using the novel mssbauer enhanced resonant @xmath5 absorption technique . under optimistic assumptions for the systematic uncertainties of both measurements , we estimate the parameter region of @xmath6 in which the mass hierarchy can be determined . if @xmath7 is relatively large , @xmath8 , and both of @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be measured with the precision of @xmath9 % it is possible to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at @xmath10 95% cl for @xmath11 for the current best fit values of all the other oscillation parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> 1.6 cm    in spite of the great progress that has been made in recent years there still remains a number of important questions regarding the nature of neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> one such unknown is whether the neutrinos have a normal or inverted mass hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> this unresolved ambiguity in the neutrino mass pattern is usually phrased as follows : if the neutrino masses are labeled as @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) for the mass of the neutrino state with the greatest ( least ) @xmath14 component then for the normal hierarchy @xmath15 and for the inverted hierarchy @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of this pattern must shed light on the secret of how the lepton sector is organized and may testify to the underlying symmetries by which the structure of neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing are prescribed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is widely recognized that it is difficult to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy by any of the ongoing and the near future neutrino oscillation experiments including the atmospheric neutrino observation by super - kamiokande @xcite , minos  @xcite , opera  @xcite , and t2k ( tokai - to - kamioka )  @xcite . the most studied method for determining </S>",
    "<S> the mass hierarchy within the scope of the future neutrino experiments is to explore the earth matter effect in long - baseline accelerator experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the way the matter effect interferes with vacuum oscillation depends upon the sign of @xmath17 , the degeneracy between the normal and the inverted mass hierarchies can be lifted in matter . </S>",
    "<S> the no@xmath18a  @xcite and the t2kk ( tokai - to - kamioka - korea )  @xcite experiments are designed to have a significant matter effect so that the hierarchy may be determined under favorable values of the unknown neutrino parameters . although it is generally accepted that long - baseline experiments are the most promising method for determining the mass hierarchy , alternative ways should be explored especially if they have the most sensitivity for neutrino parameters which are complementary to the favorable parameters for long baseline experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed in @xcite that accurate measurement of effective atmospheric scale @xmath0 both in electron and muon neutrino disappearance channels would determine the neutrino mass hierarchy , provided that precision of the measurement could reach sub percent level . </S>",
    "<S> we call this the `` @xmath0 disappearance '' method . in this paper , we describe a setting by which such precision measurement could be achieved , and perform a semi - quantitative analysis to estimate the parameter region in which the mass hierarchy can be determined by this method . for the measurement of @xmath0 in @xmath19 disappearance channel , which will be denoted as @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we assume a factor of 2 - 4 improvement with respect to what is currently expected for the phase ii of the t2k project . for the measurement of @xmath3 </S>",
