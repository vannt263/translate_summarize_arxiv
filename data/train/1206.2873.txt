    "constant @xmath11 is a dimensionless parameter , which can be identified with the square of the applied potential difference at the ends of the conductor .",
    "function @xmath12 is the positive thermal transfer coefficient , which can depend only in spatial variables @xmath13 or time @xmath14 , but for the sake of generality we take @xmath12 depending in both @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the given value @xmath15 is the initial condition for temperature .",
    "boundary conditions are derived from newton cooling law , sometimes called robin conditions or third type boundary conditions . in the particular case when @xmath16 , we obtain an homogeneous neumann condition or an adiabatic condition .",
    "other boundary conditions appear naturally , but for the sake of simplicity we consider in this paper mixed conditions only . recall that under restrictive conditions , is obtained by reducing the elliptic - parabolic system of partial differential equations modelling the so - called thermistor : @xmath17 where @xmath10 represents the temperature generated by the electric current flowing through a conductor , @xmath18 the electric potential , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 the electric and thermal conductivities , respectively . for more description ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "a throughout discussion about the history of thermistors , and more detailed accounts of their advantages and applications to industry , can be found in @xcite . since the paper of @xcite , which apparently was the first who proved the existence of weak solutions to the system",
    ", several results were obtained . in @xcite existence and regularity of weak solutions to the thermistor problem were established .",

    "optimal control of problems governed by partial differential equations is a fertile field of research and a source of many challenging mathematical issues and interesting applications @xcite . among essential points in the theory",

    "to the best of the author s knowledge , known results on the optimal control of a thermistor problem reduce to the ones of @xcite , where the term source is taken to be the control . in @xcite the problem of finding the optimal difference of applied potential to the thermistor problem , in the sense of minimizing a suitable cost functional involving the temperature , is studied .",
    "main result of @xcite gives the optimal system in the simplest case of a constant electric conductivity .",

    "the main technique of @xcite is the adjoint state and disturbance method to derive the necessary optimality conditions .",
    "recently , the authors in @xcite investigated the state - constrained optimal control of the thermistor problem with the restriction to two - dimensional domains , while in @xcite some applications to the thermistor problem , and to certain problems of filtration of fluids in a porous medium in the presence of the so - called soret ",

    "numerical experiments in @xcite show that low values of the heat transfer coefficient @xmath12 results in small temperature variations . on the other hand , low values of the heat transfer coefficient",
    "leads to high operating temperatures of a thermistor , which is undesirable from the point of view of applications .",
    "this motivates the choice of the heat transfer coefficient as the control , and to consider the optimal control problem of minimizing the heat transfer coefficient while keeping the operating temperature of the thermistor not too high .",
