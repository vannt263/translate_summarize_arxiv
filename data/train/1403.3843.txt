    "the first axiomatic study on the nonlinear stress - strain function involving a logarithmic strain tensor is , however , due to the famous geologist george ferdinand becker @xcite in 1893 . using a principle of superposition for the principal forces in the reference configuration he concludes with a stress - strain law in the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the ( symmetric in case of isotropy ) biot - stress tensor",
