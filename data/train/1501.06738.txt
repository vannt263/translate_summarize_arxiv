    "during the last decades , the standard cosmological model , i.e. , the cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ( @xmath5cdm ) model @xcite has been well established .",
    "it is consistent with several precise astronomical observations that involve wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , planck satellite @xcite , supernovae cosmology project @xcite , and so on .",
    "one of the most important and basic assumptions of the @xmath5cdm model is the cosmological principle , which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales .",
    "however , such a principle faces several challenges @xcite .",
    "the union2 snia data hint that the universe has a preferred direction pointing to @xmath6 in the galactic coordinate system @xcite . toward this direction , the universe has the maximum acceleration of expansion .",
    "astronomical observations @xcite found that the dipole moment of the peculiar velocity field on the direction @xmath7 in the scale of @xmath8 has a magnitude @xmath9 .",
    "this peculiar velocity is much larger than the value @xmath10 constrained by wmap5 @xcite .",
    "the recent released data of planck collaboration show deviations from isotropy with a level of significance ( @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "planck collaboration confirms asymmetry of the power spectra between two preferred opposite hemispheres .",
    "these facts hint that the universe may have certain preferred directions .",
    "both the @xmath5cdm model and the standard model of particle physics require no variation of fundamental physical constants in principle , such as the electromagnetic fine - structure constant @xmath12 .",
    "recently , the observations on quasar absorption spectra show that the fine - structure constant varies at cosmological scale @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in high redshift region ( @xmath13 ) , they have shown that the variation of @xmath14 is well represented by an angular dipole model pointing in the direction @xmath15 with level of significance ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "mariano and perivolaropoulos @xcite have shown that the dipole of @xmath14 is anomalously aligned with corresponding dark energy dipole obtained through the union2 sample .",
    "one possible reason of the variation of @xmath14 is the variation of the speed of light , which means that lorentz symmetry is violated on cosmological scale .",
    "the fact that the universe may have a preferred direction also means the isotropic symmetry of cosmology is violated .",
    "also , dipole direction of the fine - structure constant are aligned with cosmological preferred direction .",
    "such facts hint that both the two astronomical observations , cosmological preferred direction and variation of @xmath14 , may correspond to the same physical mechanism .",
    "finsler geometry is a possible candidate for investigating both the cosmological preferred direction and the dipole structure of the fine - structure constant .",
    "finsler geometry @xcite is a new geometry which involves riemann geometry as its special case .",
    "chern pointed out that finsler geometry is just riemann geometry without quadratic restriction , in his notices of ams .",
    "the symmetry of spacetime is described by the isometric group .",
    "the generators of isometric group are directly connected with the killing vectors .",
    "it is well known that the isometric group is a lie group in riemannian manifold .",
    "this fact also holds in finslerian manifold @xcite . generally , finsler spacetime admits less killing vectors than riemann spacetime does @xcite .",
    "the causal structure of finsler spacetime is determined by the vanishing of finslerian length @xcite . and the speed of light is modified .",
    "it has been shown that the translation symmetry is preserved in flat finsler spacetime @xcite .",
    "thus , the energy and momentum are well defined in finsler spacetime .",
    "* the property of lorentz symmetry breaking in flat finsler spacetime makes finsler geometry to be a possible mechanism of lorentz violation @xcite .",
    "historically , bogoslovsky @xcite first suggested a finslerian metric , i.e. , @xmath17 , to investigate lorentz violation .",
    "here , @xmath18 is minkowski metric and @xmath19 is a constant null vector .",
    "such metric involves lorentz symmetry violation without violation of relativistic symmetry @xcite .",
    "the relativistic symmetry is realized by means of the 3-parameter group of generalized lorentz boosts .",
    "later on the results obtained in bogoslovsky s works were mostly reproduced by gibbons et al .",
    "@xcite , with the help of the techniques of continuous deformations of the lie algebras and nonlinear realizations .",
    "gibbons et al .",
    "have pointed out that the bogoslovsky spacetime corresponds to general very special relativity which generalizes glashow s very special relativity @xcite . in the same work @xcite the 8-parametric isometry group @xcite of the bogoslovsky spacetime was called @xmath20 .",
    "although the group @xmath20 is an 8-dimensional subgroup of the 11-dimensional weyl group , pure dilations are not elements of @xmath20 . the gravitational field equation in finsler spacetime has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "models @xcite based on finsler spacetime have been developed to study the cosmological preferred directions .",
    "*    we suggested that the vacuum field equation in finsler spacetime is equivalent to the vanishing of ricci scalar @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of ricci scalar implies that the geodesic rays are parallel to each other .",
    "the geometric invariant of ricci scalar implies that the vacuum field equation is insensitive to the connection , which is an essential physical requirement .",
    "the schwarzschild metric can be deduced from a solution of our field equation if the spacetime preserves spherical symmetry .",
    "supposing spacetime to preserve the symmetry of  finslerian sphere \" , we found a non - riemannian exact solution of the finslerian vacuum field equation @xcite . in this paper , following the similar approach of our previous work @xcite , we present a modified friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric in finsler spacetime , and then use it to study the cosmological preferred direction and the dipole structure of the fine - structure constant .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec : anisotropy ] , we briefly introduce the anisotropic universe in finsler geometry . it can be seen easily that the speed of light in vacuum ( so the fine - structure constant ) is direction - dependent . in section [ sec : field - equation ] , we derive the gravitational field equation in finslerian universe , and obtain the distance - redshift relation . in section [ sec : observation ] , we use the union2.1 compilation to derive the preferred direction of the universe .",
    "we find that it is obviously aligned with the dipole direction of the fine - structure constant .",
    "finally , conclusions and remarks are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "finsler geometry is based on the so - called finsler structure @xmath21 defined on the tangent bundle of a manifold @xmath22 , with the property @xmath23 for all @xmath24 , where @xmath25 represents position and @xmath26 represents velocity .",
    "the finslerian metric is given as @xcite @xmath27 in physics , the finsler structure @xmath21 is not positive - definite at every point of finsler manifold .",
    "we focus on investigating finsler spacetime with lorentz signature . a positive",
    ", zero and negative @xmath21 correspond to time - like , null and space - like curves , respectively . for massless particles ,",
    "the stipulation is @xmath28 .",
    "the finslerian metric reduces to riemannian metric , if @xmath29 is quadratic in @xmath30 .",
    "one non - riemannian finsler spacetime is randers spacetime @xcite .",
    "it is given as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is riemannian metric . throughout this paper ,",
    "the indices are lowered and raised by @xmath34 and its inverse matrix @xmath35 . and the objects that decorate with a tilde are lowered and raised by @xmath36 and its inverse matrix @xmath37 .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an ansatz that the finsler structure of the universe is of the form @xmath38 where we require the vector @xmath39 in @xmath40 is of the form @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a constant . here , the riemannian metric @xmath33 of randers space @xmath40 is set to be euclidian , that is , @xmath43 .",
    "thus the finslerian universe ( [ frw like ] ) returns to frw spacetime while @xmath44 .",
    "the above requirement for @xmath39 and @xmath33 implies that the spatial part of the universe @xmath40 is a flat finsler space , since all types of finslerian curvatures vanish for @xmath40 .",
    "the killing equations of randers space @xmath40 are given as @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the lie derivative along the killing vector @xmath47 and the comma denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath48 .",
    "noticing that the vector @xmath39 parallel to @xmath49-axis , we find from the killing equations ( [ killing eq1],[killing eq2 ] ) that there are four independent killing vectors in randers space @xmath40 .",
    "three of them represent the translation symmetry , and the rest one represents the rotational symmetry in @xmath50 plane .",
    "it means that the rotational symmetry in @xmath51 and @xmath52 plane are broken .",
    "this fact means that the finslerian universe ( [ frw like ] ) is anisotropic .    to derive the relation between luminosity distance and redshift ,",
    "first we need investigate the redshift of photon in finslerian universe ( [ frw like ] ) .",
    "the redshift of photon can be derived from the geodesic equation . the geodesic equation for finsler manifold",
    "is given as@xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is called geodesic spray coefficients .",
    "it can be proved from the geodesic equation ( [ geodesic ] ) that the finsler structure @xmath21 is a constant along the geodesic . plugging the finsler structure ( [ frw like ] ) into the formula ( [ geodesic spray ] ) , we obtain that @xmath55 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time and @xmath56 is the hubble parameter . then , the geodesic equations in finsler universe ( [ frw like ] ) are given as @xmath57 in finsler spacetime the null condition of photon is given as @xmath28 .",
    "it is of the form @xmath58 plugging the null condition ( [ null condition ] ) into the geodesic equation ( [ geodesic eq1 ] ) , we obtain the solution @xmath59 it yields that the formula of redshift @xmath49 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the speed of light and the subscript zero denotes the quantities given at present epoch .    the recent michelson - morley experiment carried through by mller et al .",
    "@xcite gives a precise limit on lorentz invariance violation .",
    "their experiment shows that the change of resonance frequencies of the optical resonators is of this magnitude @xmath62 .",
    "it means that the minkowski spacetime describes well the inertial system on the earth .",
    "thus , we must require no variation of the speed of light at the present epoch .",
    "in finslerian universe , the local inertial system at large cosmological scale is built by the flat finsler spacetime , namely , @xmath63 thus , the radial speed of light at large cosmological scale can be derived from @xmath64 .",
    "it is of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the angle with respect to @xmath49-axis .",
    "then , plugging the equation ( [ sol ] ) into the formula ( [ redshift1 ] ) , and noticing @xmath67 , we obtain @xmath68    a direct deduction gives that the variation of the speed of light is the variation of the fine - structure constant . by making use of the formula ( [ sol ] )",
    ", we obtain the variation of the fine - structure constant @xmath69 here , we suppose that the finslerian parameter @xmath42 is a small quantity .",
    "the formula ( [ vari alpha ] ) tells us that @xmath70 have a dipole distribution at cosmological scale , which is compatible with the observations on quasar absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "in finsler geometry , there is a geometrical invariant quantity , i.e. , ricci scalar .",
    "it is of the form @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "though @xmath73 depends on connections , @xmath74 does not @xcite .",
    "the ricci scalar only depends on the finsler structure @xmath21 and is insensitive to connections . plugging the geodesic coefficients ( [ geodesic spray t],[geodesic spray i ] ) into the formula of ricci scalar ( [ ricci scalar ] )",
    ", we obtain that @xmath75 here , we define the modified einstein tensor in finsler spacetime as @xmath76 where the ricci tensor is defined as @xcite @xmath77 and the scalar curvature in finsler spacetime is given as @xmath78 . plugging the equation of ricci scalar ( [ ricci scalar1 ] ) into the formula ( [ einstein tensor ] ) , we obtain @xmath79    following the similar approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to construct a self - consistent gravitational field equation in finsler spacetime ( [ frw like ] ) , we investigate the covariant conserve properties of the modified einstein tensor @xmath80 .",
    "the covariant derivative of @xmath80 in finsler spacetime is given as @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the chern connection .",
    "here , we have used ` @xmath84 ' to denote the covariant derivative .",
    "the chern connection can be expressed in terms of geodesic spray coefficients @xmath85 and cartan connection @xmath86",
    "@xcite @xmath87 noticing that the modified einstein tensor @xmath80 does not have @xmath30-dependence , and cartan tensor @xmath88 ( index @xmath89 run over @xmath90 ) , one can easily get that the chern connection @xmath91 equals to the christoffel connection that deduced from frw metric if @xmath92 . by making use of this property and the formula of geodesic spray ( [ geodesic spray t],[geodesic spray i ] ) , we find that @xmath93 now , we have proved that the modified einstein tensor is conserved in finsler spacetime .",
    "then , following the spirit of general relativity , we propose that the gravitational field equation in the given finsler spacetime ( [ frw like ] ) should be of the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the volume of finsler space @xcite is generally different with the one of riemann geometry .",
    "however , in terms of busemann - hausdorff volumm form , the volume of a close randers - finsler surface is the same with unit riemannian sphere @xcite . this is why we have used @xmath96 in the field equation ( [ field equation ] ) .",
    "since the modified einstein tensor @xmath80 only depends on @xmath48 , thus the gravitational field equation ( [ field equation ] ) requires that the energy - momentum tensor @xmath95 depends on @xmath48 and contains diagonal components only .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath97 to be the form as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the energy density and the pressure density of universe , respectively . then , the gravitational field equation ( [ field equation ] ) can be written as @xmath101 and the covariant conservation of energy - momentum tensor @xmath102 gives @xmath103 combining the equations ( [ field eq t],[conservation t ] ) , we obtain @xmath104 where @xmath105 is hubble constant , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "here we focus on using the union2.1 snia data @xcite to study the preferred direction of the universe and constrain the magnitude of finslerian parameter @xmath42 . by making use of equations ( [ null condition],[redshift2],[h2 ] ) , the luminosity distance in finslerian universe",
    "is given as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the radial distance . to find the preferred direction in finslerian universe",
    ", we perform a least-@xmath110 fit to union2.1 snia data @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the theoretical distance modulus given by @xmath113 @xmath114 and @xmath115 , given by the union2.1 snia data , denote the observed values of the distance modulus and the measurement errors , respectively .",
    "the least-@xmath110 fit of formula ( [ lumin dis ] ) to the union2.1 data shows that the preferred direction locates at @xmath0 , and the magnitude of anisotropy @xmath1 .",
    "the preferred direction is consistent with the dipole direction derived by reference @xcite . before using our model to fit the union2.1 snia data , we have fixed the hubble constant @xmath105 and @xmath116 to be @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which are derived by fitting the union2.1 data to the standard @xmath5cdm model .    in finslerian universe ( [ frw like ] )",
    ", the fine - structure constant has a dipole structure ( see equation ( [ vari alpha ] ) for details ) .",
    "we fit the data of quasar absorption spectra @xcite obtained by very large telescope ( vlt ) and keck observatory to formula ( [ vari alpha ] ) , and find the magnitude of dipole to be @xmath3 , pointing towards @xmath2 in the galactic coordinate system .",
    "we plot the preferred direction of the union2.1 sample and the dipole direction of the fine - structure constant in the galactic coordinate system in fig.[fig : finslerian_dipole_f1 ] .    , which is obtained by fixing the parameters @xmath118 and @xmath117 and doing the least-@xmath110 fit to the union2.1 data for formula ( [ lumin dis ] ) .",
    "the blue point locates at @xmath2 , which is obtained by the least-@xmath110 fit to the data of the fine - structure constant .",
    "the contours enclose 68% confidence regions for the preferred directions .",
    "the angular separation between the two preferred directions is about @xmath4 . ]",
    "we can see that they are consistent within @xmath119 uncertainty .",
    "the angular separation between the two directions is about @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper , we have suggested that the universe is finslerian .",
    "the finslerian universe ( [ frw like ] ) breaks the rotational symmetry in @xmath51 and @xmath52 plane , and modifies the speed of light at large cosmological scale .",
    "the preferred direction of union2.1 snia sample and the dipole structure of the fine - structure constant are naturally given in finslerian universe .",
    "formula ( [ vari alpha ] ) and ( [ lumin dis ] ) show that the preferred directions of cosmic accelerating expansion and fine - structure constant both locate at the same direction .",
    "this fact is compatible with our numerical results . by applying our formula ( [ lumin dis ] ) to union2.1 snia data",
    ", we found a preferred direction @xmath0 . and by applying our formula ( [ vari alpha ] ) to the data of quasar absorption spectra , we found a preferred direction @xmath2 .",
    "the angular separation between the two preferred directions is about @xmath4 , which means that the two directions are compatible within @xmath119 uncertainty .",
    "however , our numerical results show that the anisotropic magnitude that correspond to union2.1 snia data and the data of quasar absorption spectra are different . this fact contradicts with the prediction of finslerian universe , which requires the absolute values of magnitude of the anisotropy should be the same .",
    "if the universe is finslerian , such contradiction may be attributed to two reasons .",
    "one reason is the finslerian parameter @xmath42 should be a function of redshift . since the range of redshift of the two observational datesets are different .",
    "the other reason is that the union2.1 snia data are not accurate enough .",
    "our numerical results for the magnitude of finslerian parameter @xmath42 show that the statistical significance of union2.1 snia data is about @xmath120 confidence level , while the data of the fine - structure constant is about @xmath121 confidence level .",
    "thus , further astronomical observations are needed in order to enhance the statistical significance in the future .",
