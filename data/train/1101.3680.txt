    "phase transitions and critical behavior in complex networks currently attract much attention @xcite because of their unusual features and broad array of applications , ranging from socio- @xcite to nanophysics @xcite .",
    "it is by now well established that the critical behavior of a many - particle interacting system located on the nodes of a general network may crucially differ from that of a system located on the sites of a @xmath1-dimensional regular lattice .",
    "of particular interest are the so - called scale - free networks , for which the probability to find a node of degree @xmath2 ( i.e. with @xmath2 nearest neighbors ) vanishes for large @xmath2 as a power law    @xmath3    the questions we address in this paper concern two fundamental principles of critical phenomena : universality and scaling @xcite . both of these questions have to be reconsidered when a system resides on a network .",
    "usually , the universality of critical phenomena is understood as stating that the thermodynamic properties near the critical point @xmath4 are governed by a small number of global features , such as dimensionality , symmetry , and the type of interaction . in turn , the scaling hypothesis states that the singular part of a thermodynamic potential near @xmath4 has the form of a generalized homogeneous function . to be specific , for the helmholtz potential of a magnetic system",
    "the latter can be written as @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetization , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the universal exponents , and the sign @xmath10 corresponds to @xmath11 or @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the essence of relation ( [ 1.2 ] ) is that the two - variable function @xmath13 , when appropriately rescaled , is expressed in terms of a single scaling variable leading to the _ scaling function _ @xmath14 .",
    "the expression ( [ 1.2 ] ) gives an example of the scaling function for the helmholtz potential @xmath13 .",
    "together with other scaling functions - for the equation of state and for thermodynamic functions - this appears to give a suitable and comprehensive description of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "these scaling functions are also universal in the sense explained above .    for systems on scale - free networks",
    "the principle of universality is extended : there , the node - degree distribution exponent @xmath0 in eq.([1.1 ] ) appears to be a global variable and plays a crucial role , similar to the dimension @xmath1 for systems on lattices ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all systems that belong to a given universality class are governed by the same values of critical exponents and critical amplitude ratios and share the same universal form of scaling functions .",
    "recently , the scaling function formalism has been applied to describe the critical behavior of magnetic systems with the structure of a scale - free network @xcite . there , scaling functions for the magnetic equation of state and isothermal susceptibility were derived . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the entropic form of the equation of state . in particular",
    "this opens the possibility to derive scaling functions for the heat capacity .",
    "these are of wide and fundamental interest in the theory of critical phenomena and have been the subject of thorough theoretical and experimental studies for various magnetic , fluid , and superconducting systems @xcite . a particular point of interest concerns the existence or non - existence of the moments of the distribution ( [ 1.1 ] ) on the universal behavior .",
    "the set - up of the the paper is as follows : in section [ ii ] we define the notations and derive expressions for the entropic equation of state , heat capacity and magnetocaloric coefficient scaling functions for systems on scale - free networks .",
    "these expressions are further analyzed and compared with corresponding functions for bulk systems in section [ iii ] .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary and an outlook in section [ iv ] .",
    "the critical behavior of a many - particle system interacting on a scale - free network crucially depends on the node degree distribution @xmath15 via the decay exponent @xmath0 in eq.([1.1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , for an infinite network the value of @xmath0 determines the order of the first diverging moment , this order being the lowest integer @xmath16 .",
    "this is reflected by the phase transition scenario . for low values of @xmath17",
    "the system remains ordered for any finite temperature , whereas for @xmath18 a finite temperature , order - disorder phase transition occurs .",
    "moreover , critical exponents that govern a second - order phase transition in a scale - free network attain their usual mean - field values for high @xmath19 and demonstrate non - trivial @xmath0-dependence in the region @xmath20 .",
    "logarithmic corrections to scaling laws appear at @xmath21 : this resembles phenomena that occur at marginal space or order parameter dimensions in bulk systems @xcite .    a starting point for our analysis will be the expression for the free energy of a system with scalar order parameter on a scale - free network . to be specific , from now on we will consider ferromagnetic ordering and the spontaneous magnetization @xmath6 as the order parameter with the conjugate magnetic field @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the corresponding microscopic degrees of freedom are the ising spins . however , generalization to models of more complicated symmetry is straightforward @xcite . due to the fact that the type of networks under discussion are assumed to have a local tree - like structure ,",
    "the mean - field approximation is asymptotically exact in the sense that thermal fluctuations can be neglected .",
    "this leads to a form of the free energy also found by other techniques .",
    "the lowest order contributions to the singular part of the helmholtz free energy in the vicinity of @xmath4 are @xcite @xmath23 the parameters @xmath24 and the critical temperature @xmath4 are @xmath0-dependent .",
    "this dependence can be made explicit using microscopic approaches @xcite or may be postulated in a landau - like approach @xcite .",
    "for the subsequent analysis we will absorb the parameters into the dimensions of the corresponding observables , passing to dimensionless quantities , @xmath25 with obvious relations between dimension - dependent and dimensionless variables , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 . since @xmath29 measures the absolute distance to the critical point , the free energy has two branches , corresponding to signs @xmath30 and @xmath31 in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.3 ] ) and ( [ 2.4 ] ) for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to verify , that a system with the free energy ( [ 2.3 ] ) , ( [ 2.4 ] ) possesses a second - order phase transition at @xmath32 .",
    "here , we employ the standard notation for critical exponents governing the temperature- and field - dependencies of the thermodynamic functions . for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , these are @xmath35 while for @xmath36 one also has @xmath37 on the other hand , for @xmath32 , the standard definitions are @xmath38 ( see section [ iic ] for the definition of the magnetocaloric coefficient @xmath39 . ) the values of these critical exponents are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting here that one way to derive the listed exponents is to consider the nave dimensions of different terms in the landau free energy , similar to the standard field theoretical procedure ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "= 0.5em    .[tab1 ] critical exponents governing temperature and field dependencies of the thermodynamic quantities for different values of @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      before we proceed with the discussion of the peculiarities of the entropic equation of state and of the thermodynamic functions following from it , let us introduce an additional observable  the isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient .",
    "it serves as a direct measure of the heat released by the system due to the magnetocaloric effect upon an isothermal increase of the magnetic field and is defined as ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath41 in contradistinction to the heat capacity , which often does not diverge or is a weakly divergent quantity for many 3d systems , the magnetocaloric coefficient is frequently strongly divergent at second - order phase transitions @xcite and therefore it is instructive to analyze how this behavior is modified by a scale - free network . using maxwell relations , @xmath42 can be obtained both from the magnetic or from the entropic equations of state , eqs .",
    "( [ 2.11 ] ) , ( [ 2.12 ] ) .",
    "therefore an equivalent representation to the one given in ( [ 2.34 ] ) representation reads : @xmath43 analogous to the first equation in ( [ 2.5 ] ) , we define the dimensionless isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient as @xmath44 from the above representation this is @xmath45 ) is a dimensionless isothermal susceptibility @xmath46 and writing it in the scaling form @xmath47 we arrive at the scaling representation for the dimensionless isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient @xmath39 @xmath48 with the scaling function @xmath49 and a scaling relation for the isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient critical exponent @xmath50 , @xmath51 while the equality ( [ 2.40 ] ) is a general one and directly follows from the scaling form of eq .",
    "( [ 2.36 ] ) , the relation ( [ 2.39 ] ) between functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 holds only for systems where the entropy scaling function has the simple representation ( [ 2.21 ] ) .",
    "as noticed above , another way to obtain @xmath39 is to start from the magnetic equation of state using the representation ( [ 2.34 ] ) .",
    "then one obtains @xmath54 ) , ( [ 2.18 ] ) one arrives at the relation between the scaling functions @xmath52 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 which in particular leads to ( c.f .",
    "( [ 2.39 ] ) ) @xmath57    the scaling function @xmath52 defined above is displayed for different ranges of the values of @xmath0 in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "for the critical exponents @xmath50 we get @xmath58 it is easy to find the scaling relation for the critical exponent @xmath59 that governs the field dependence of @xmath60 @xcite : @xmath61 the values of this exponent read @xmath62 thus while @xmath63 does not diverge ( @xmath64 ) for the entire range @xmath65 , @xmath39 is divergent ( @xmath66 ) over half that range @xmath67 , and is a better locator of the phase transition there .",
    "the above calculated exponents @xmath50 , @xmath59 are displayed together with other exponents in the comprehensive table [ tab1 ] , which presents a summary of the data concerning the temperature and field behavior of different thermodynamic quantities in the vicinity of the critical point for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "in the course of the analysis of different types of critical phenomena in scale - free networks @xcite , it has been revealed that the onset of divergencies of moments of the node - degree distribution function @xmath15 , eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) relate to changes in the scaling scenario of these systems . as one can see from ( [ 2.44 ] ) , ( [ 2.46 ] ) the exponents @xmath50 and @xmath59 change their sign to become negative for @xmath68 : @xmath39 is not divergent at the critical point any more in the region @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , along with the two marginal values of @xmath21 and @xmath70 which correspond to the divergencies of @xmath71 and @xmath72 and define the window of non - trivial critical behavior on a scale - free network .",
    "the divergence of the third moment of the node - degree distribution @xmath73 leads to a qualitative change in the critical behavior of the isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient .",
    "as one can see from table [ tab1 ] , the heat capacity exponent @xmath8 is negative in the region @xmath20 where a non - trivial @xmath74 dependence is observed .",
    "this means that the singular part of the heat capacity @xmath63 vanishes at @xmath4 .",
    "taken that @xmath63 vanishes also at @xmath75 and that it is a positive smooth function of @xmath76 in between , one concludes that it has a maximum at some temperature @xmath77 , where @xmath78 for any @xmath79 .",
    "therefore the energy fluctuations are maximal at @xmath77 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "such behavior is a generic feature of systems with @xmath80 , other examples include the three dimensional heisenberg and planar magnets @xcite , liquid helium @xcite , and disordered uniaxial magnets @xcite . from eqs.([2.25 ] ) and ( [ 2.30 ] ) one finds that @xmath81 for any @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to the following amplitude ratio which holds for all @xmath40 : @xmath82 amplitude ratios are known to be universal along with the scaling functions and critical exponents ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is appropriate to adduce here how do these ratios change for systems on scale - free networks .",
    "the results are summarized in the lower part of table [ tab2 ] .",
    "besides than the heat capacity amplitude ratio ( [ 3.1 ] ) , the isothermal magnetic - susceptibility amplitude ratio appears to be @xmath0-dependent for @xmath20 : @xmath83 @xcite . using the expressions ( [ 2.22 ] ) , ( [ 2.25 ] ) , ( [ 2.28 ] ) , ( [ 2.30 ] ) it is straightforward to find for the other amplitudes for @xmath84 @xmath85 and for @xmath20 , @xmath86 now , defining three more amplitude ratios by @xcite @xmath87 and substituting into these ratios the amplitudes ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) , we arrive at their values for the scale - free network , as listed in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "let us concentrate now on the scaling functions . as noted in section [ ii ] , the entropy scaling function @xmath88 which in the usual landau theory is given by eq .",
    "( [ 2.21 ] ) keeps its form also in the case of scale - free networks with @xmath89 .",
    "however , the constant - magnetic - field heat capacity scaling function @xmath90 essentially changes in this region . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot @xmath90 as a function of the scaling variable @xmath91 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the most striking feature in the behavior of the scaling function is that its asymptotics for large @xmath92 change for @xmath93 . indeed , for @xmath19 the asymptotical value is given by a constant , @xmath94 , whereas in the range @xmath95 the function behaves as a power law , @xmath96 in turn , this",
    "is reflected in the development of a minimum in the @xmath97 branch of the function as @xmath0 decreases ( see the figure ) .",
    "heat capacity scaling functions @xmath98 ( dotted curves , blue online ) and @xmath99 ( solid curves , red online ) as functions of the scaling variable @xmath91 at @xmath84 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 ( lower , middle and upper pairs of curves , respectively).,width=340 ]    another particular feature of the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is inherent to the presentation of the scaling plots in the @xmath102@xmath92-plane and is connected to the presence of a pole in @xmath55 for small @xmath92 . as one sees immediately from eqs .",

    "however , the physical values of the scaling variable @xmath92 do not cover the region where the pole occurs .",
    "indeed , from the magnetic equations of state ( [ 2.22 ] ) , ( [ 2.28 ] ) one may obtain the solutions for the magnetization at zero magnetic field @xmath106 . taking that a non - zero magnetic field must increase the value of @xmath107 one arrives at the following minimal values of the scaling variable @xmath92 : @xmath108 therefore , the curves for the scaling function @xmath109 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] originate at the corresponding minimal values of @xmath92 defined by the relations ( [ 3.9 ] ) , ( [ 3.10 ] ) .    in turn , as explained in section [ ii ] , one may re - express the scaling function @xmath90 in terms of the scaled magnetic field @xmath110 using eq .",
    "( [ 2.31 ] ) .",
    "corresponding plots for the scaling function @xmath111 in this variable are given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "again , one observes a change in the asymptotics of the scaling function : instead of a constant at @xmath84 , for @xmath112 the asymptotic functional dependence is given by @xmath113     heat capacity scaling functions @xmath114 ( dotted curves , blue online ) and @xmath115 ( solid curves , red online ) as functions of the scaling variable @xmath116 at @xmath19 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 ( lower , middle and upper pairs of curves , respectively).,width=340 ]    in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we give the plots of the scaling functions @xmath117 for the isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient in the scaling variables @xmath91 and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "as discussed at the end of the previous section , @xmath39 changes its behavior at @xmath119 .",
    "this feature is also reflected in the behavior of the scaling functions : their asymptotics change at @xmath119 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath84 the function decays as @xmath120 whereas from the asymptotic behavior in the region @xmath20 , @xmath121 one concludes , that for @xmath68 the power law decay switches to a power law growth , while @xmath122 for the marginal value @xmath119 . the corresponding asymptotics in the variables @xmath110 is of the form @xmath123     scaling functions fo the isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient . @xmath124 ( dotted curves , blue online ) and @xmath125 ( solid curves , red online ) as functions of the scaling variable @xmath91 at @xmath19 , @xmath119 , and @xmath126 ( lower , middle and upper pairs of curves , respectively ) .",

    "usually the universality of critical phenomena is attributed to the presence of only a few relevant global parameters .",
    "different systems that share the same values of these global variables manifest the same criticality .",
    "a classical example is given by the famous 3d ising model universality class that is inherent to the critical behavior of such differing systems as uniaxial magnets , simple fluids or binary alloys .",
    "the critical behavior in all these systems is quantitatively described by the same values of the critical exponents , amplitude ratios , and by the same form of the scaling functions .",
    "as this paper demonstrates , in particular the usual ` euclidean space ' understanding of universality of critical phenomena breaks down if the critical behavior occurs on a scale - free network .",
    "the presence of high - degree vertices ( hubs ) may lead to substantial changes in ordering processes .",
    "the parameter that controls the ` importance ' of the hubs is the node - degree distribution exponent @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) , and it is this parameter that plays the role of a global variable as far as the critical behavior is considered .    in particular , the universal quantities that govern criticality become @xmath0-dependent for small enough @xmath0 and in this way the network structure is felt . however",
    ", the presence of magnetization is necessary to ` feel ' the network structure . to give an example , the structure matters for @xmath12 at any @xmath132 and for @xmath11 for @xmath133 ( c.f . that amplitude @xmath134 is @xmath0-dependent , whereas @xmath135 is not ) .",
    "another interesting observation is that the fluctuation in network structure only enters via the magnetization and since the entropy @xmath136 is measured at constant magnetization , it is given by a usual landau - like mean field value for any @xmath40 .",
    "this makes a difference between the global parameters @xmath0 and dimension @xmath1 regarding its influence of the fluctuations on calculating the singular behaviour of the physical quantities : no renormalization - group calculation is necessary .    in this paper",
    "we completed the quantitative description of critical behavior in scale - free networks by calculating the entropic equation of state , the resulting scaling functions as well as the universal amplitude ratios .",
    "the corresponding formulas , together with other data for the critical exponents and amplitudes are summarized in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] .",
    "they constitute a comprehensive list of observables that describe the scaling and characterize the criticality in scale - free networks .",
    "the starting point for our study was the asymptotic form of the free energy in the vicinity of a critical point in a scale - free network , eqs .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) , ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "the validity of this expression has been proven at different levels of rigor using microscopic approaches based on the recursion relations @xcite the replica method @xcite or phenomenological landau approaches @xcite as well as mean field theory @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to note here that , because the networks under discussion have a local tree - like structure , the mean - field approximation is asymptotically exact .",
    "one of the consequences of this fact is that the values of the exponents do not change if an @xmath137-symmetrical order parameter is considered ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as it is usual in the landau theory .",
