    "the study of hypersurfaces of discontinuity plays a fundamental role in general relativity .",
    "pioneering work can be traced back to sen @xcite , lanczos @xcite , darmois @xcite , and later by obrien and synge  @xcite , lichnerowicz  @xcite , and israel @xcite , amongst others . several approaches to deduce the geometric conditions of the surface layer",
    "were carried out .",
    "for instance , sen in a relatively unknown paper @xcite , used continuous four - dimensional coordinates across the layer , an approach later applied by lichnerowicz , and obrien and synge .",
    "darmois expressed the surface properties of the discontinuity of the extrinsic curvature across the layer as a function of the surfaces intrinsic coordinates , which was later generalized by israel @xcite , using independently defined four - dimensional coordinate systems @xmath0 of the two different manifolds glued at the junction surface . since then , the hypersurfaces of discontinuity have had an extensive range of applicability .",
    "it is perhaps important to emphasize that the matching of an interior dust solution to an exterior schwarzschild spacetime , by oppenheimer and snyder , provided the first insights of the gravitational collapse into a black hole @xcite .",
    "one can mention more recent applications of the thin shell formalism , namely , gravitational collapse of radiating shells , the evolution of bubbles and domain walls in cosmological settings and in inflationary models , the structure and dynamics of voids in the large scale structure of the universe , shells around black holes and their respective stability , signature changes , matchings of cosmological solutions , and applications to the randall - sundrum brane world scenario to wormhole physics .",
    "an analysis in thick gravitating walls expanded in powers of the thickness of the wall has also been carried out @xcite .",
    "the lightlike limit was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and an equivalence between the darmois - israel formalism and the distributional method for thin shells was established in ref .",
    "@xcite . due to the extensive applications of the darmois - israel formalism",
    ", a computer algebra system was implemented to aid relativists in the evaluation of junction conditions and the parameters associated with thin shells  @xcite .",
    "the application of the darmois - israel formalism to black holes and wormhole physics is of a particular interest . relatively to black holes , in an interesting paper @xcite , the schwarzschild metric inside the event horizon was matched to the de sitter solution at a spacelike junction surface .",
    "the respective properties of the layer were explored , and it was found that instead of a singularity , a closed world can be formed inside the black hole . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a thin shell was constructed around a black hole and its characteristics were explored by imposing the energy conditions , and in ref .",
    "@xcite the respective stability of the thin shell was analyzed against spherically symmetric perturbations about a static solution .",
    "relatively to wormhole physics , using the cut - and - paste technique , visser constructed thin - shell wormholes , and considered a partial stability analysis by imposing specific equations of state  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite thin - shell schwarzschild wormholes were considered and the respective stability to spherically symmetric perturbations around static solutions was analyzed , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "it was later found that the inclusion of a charge @xcite and of a positive cosmological constant @xcite significantly increases the stability regions .",
    "specific wormhole solutions were also constructed by matching an interior traversable wormhole solution to exterior vacuum spacetimes at a junction interface @xcite .",

    "@xcite , generic surface stresses in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a similar analysis for plane symmetric traversable wormholes in an anti - de sitter background was extensively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "ishak and lake developed a formalism to analyze the stability of spherically symmetric thin shells by imposing spacetimes that satisfy the transparency condition @xcite , which amounts to considering solutions that do not contribute with the discontinuity flux term in the conservation identity .",
    "the dynamics of timelike spherical thin shells , satisfying the transparency condition were also analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    ", we include this momentum flux term , which severely complicates the analysis , and following the ishak - lake approach , we analyze the stability of generic spherically symmetric thin shells to linearized perturbations about static equilibrium solutions .",
    "we then deduce a master equation dictating the stability regions . considering the transparency condition , we study the stability of thin shells around black holes , showing that our analysis is in agreement with previous results .",
    "we also apply the general formalism to specific wormhole solutions , and by considering particular form functions , we verify that the stability regions can be significantly increased by taking into account appropriate choices of the redshift function . in this context , a specific application of the general formalism developed in this paper has been applied to traversable wormhole solutions @xcite supported by phantom energy @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we outline a brief summary of the darmois - israel formalism , which shall be used throughout the work . in section iii",
    ", we present two generic spherically symmetric spacetimes matched together at a junction interface and deduce the surface stresses of the thin shell .",
    "based on the inclusion of the momentum flux term in the conservation identity , fundamental relationships for analyzing the stability regions are also deduced . from the equation of motion , a master equation , dictating the stable equilibrium configurations , is deduced . in section iv",
    ", we shall apply the formalism developed to thin shells around black holes . in section",
