    "the linear variation of mode frequencies with the changing solar magnetic activity is well established @xcite .",
    "however , detailed studies based on high quality uniform data indicate the complexity of the relationship between mode frequencies and solar activity .",
    "for example , @xcite have shown that there is a latitudinal variation in frequencies and splitting coefficients .",
    "in addition , @xcite found a year - wise distribution in linear - regression slopes ( i e. the change in frequency per unit change in activity ) and the degree of correlation .",
    "thus , with the availability of continuous data for a complete solar cycle , it is important to study correlations of oscillation frequencies with different measures of the solar activity in order to understand the source of the variability .",
    "the analysis presented here uses oscillation data sets obtained from the global oscillation network group ( gong ) and michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) _ onboard solar and helipspheric observatory ( soho ) _ and solar activity data .",
    "it covers a period of about 13 years , i.e. a complete solar cycle including both minimum phases at the beginning and end of solar cycle 23 .",
    "the 128 108-day gong data sets spanning over the period from 1995 may 7 to 2008 feb 27 are continuous while the 61 72-day mdi data sets have two large gaps in 1998 - 1999 .",
    "the mdi data cover the period from 1996 may 1 to 2008 sept 30 .",
    "the activity data used here are : the integrated emission from the solar disk at 10.7 cm wavelength ( @xmath0 ) , the line - of sight magnetic field strength from kitt peak observatory ( kpmi ) , the international sunspot number ( @xmath1 ) , the mt .",
    "wilson sunspot index ( mwsi ) , the magnetic plage strength index ( mpsi ) from mt .",
    "wilson and the total solar irradiance ( tsi ) .",
    "details of the various data sets are given in @xcite .",
    "the number of _",
    "p- _ modes analysed here are 479 for gong and 876 for mdi data sets in the frequency range 1.5 @xmath2 4.0 mhz .",
    "these modes are observed in all data sets of gong or mdi .",
    "we also analyze 76 _ f_-modes observed in all mdi data sets .",
    "the frequency shifts ( @xmath3 ) are calculated with respect to the reference frequency which is determined by taking an average of the frequencies of a particular multiplet ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the temporal variation of gong frequency shifts ( @xmath3 ) with various measures of solar activity ( @xmath5 ) are shown in figure  1 .",
    "it is evident that the frequency shifts follow the general trend of the solar activity .",
    "the correlation coefficients between @xmath3 and @xmath5 obtained in all cases are comparable .",
    "however , we find significant different correlation coefficients when we divide the activity cycle into four phases as shown in figure 2 ; the periods of minimum activity at the beginning and end of the solar cycle ( _ phase i _ ) , rising activity ( _ phase ii _ ) , high - acivity ( _ phase iii _ ) , and declining activity ( _ phase iv _ ) . in the right panel of figure  2 , we compare the phase - wise pearson s linear correlation coefficients ( @xmath6 ) for both gong and mdi data sets with those obtained for the complete cycle .",
    "it is interesting to note that the correlation between @xmath3 and solar activity changes significantly from phase to phase ; the rising and declining phases are better correlated than the low- and high - activity phases .",
    "the frequencies during _ phase i _ do not correlate well with any of the proxies . during _ phase iii _ , we obtain significant correlations for @xmath0 and kpmi while a substantial decrease is noticed for @xmath1 , mwsi and tsi .",
    "figure  3 ( left panel ) shows the temporal variation of _",
    "f_-mode frequencies .",
    "we notice two distinct features in frequency shifts ; the persisting strong 1-year periodicity as discussed by several authors @xcite and the frequencies at current solar minimum ( 2007 - 2008 ) are lower than those at the previous minimum ( 1996 ) .",
    "the correlation coefficients obtained with the original and smoothed frequency shifts are also shown in the right panel .",
    "the smoothed frequency shifts are the running mean of five points to minimize the effect of 1-year periodicity .",
    "it is seen that smoothing enhances the correlation in all cases .",
    "the variation in correlation coefficients for _ f_-modes at different phases are consistent with those for",
    "_ p_-modes . in both cases ,",
    "mdi data sets have good correlation with tsi at the low - activity phase that requires a detailed investigation .",
    "in summary , the improved and continuous measurements of intermediate - degree mode frequencies for a complete solar cycle demonstrate that , while the frequencies vary in phase with the solar activity , the degree of correlation between frequencies and activity indices differs from one activity phase to another .",
    "although there is a strong correlation during rising and declining activity phases , we find a significant decrease in correlation at the low- and high - activity phases .",
