    "the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect in doped manganites with perovskite structure has stimulated considerable interest for the understanding of their physical properties @xcite .",
    "though the insulator to metal ( i m ) transition and its associated cmr are well explained on the basis of the double exchange ( de ) model , it is pointed out that the dynamic jahn - teller ( jt ) effect due to the strong electron - phonon interaction , plays a significant role in the appearance of cmr as well as the de interaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dagotto et al propose a phase separation model where the ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulating clusters coexist and their model strongly supports recent experimental studies on the physics of manganites @xcite .    in bilayer manganites",
    "la@xmath8sr@xmath9mn@xmath0o@xmath3 , in which a mno@xmath0 bilayer is alternatively stacked with a ( la , sr ) @xmath0o@xmath0 blocking layer along the @xmath10-axis , the physical properties strongly depend on hole doping level , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in particular , neutron diffraction study on half doped lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath3(@xmath11=0.5 ) has revealed the coexistence of the a - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase and ce - type antiferromagnetic charge - ordered / orbital - ordered ( co / oo ) phase@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the ce - type co / oo state in cubic manganites is unstable against cr - substitution for mn - site and lightly cr doping up to a few percents yields a drastic collapse of the co / oo phase , resulting in a fm metallic phase even in the absence of any applied magnetic field @xcite . while several reports on the effect of cr substitution on the physical properties of the cubic manganites have appeared ,",
    "very few reports have appeared on such studies in the case of bilayer manganites@xcite . here , we give some comments on pressure effect on a two - dimensional network of mno@xmath12 octahedra in bilayer mangantes la@xmath13sr@xmath14mn@xmath0o@xmath3 .",

    "the 3@xmath18 electronic state of cr@xmath5 ion is taken as @xmath19 ( spin quantum number @xmath20=3/2 ) , resulting in undistorted cro@xmath12 octahedron sites free from local jahn - teller effect .",
    "this finding is quite reasonable with a volume shrinkage observed due to cr - doping because a removal of @xmath6 orbital from mn@xmath5 sites easily causes a suppression of local lattice distortion as discussed later . in the parent material lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath3 ,",
    "a majority phase of the a - type afm state coexists with a minority phase of ce - type afm charg - ordered / orbital - ordered state @xcite .",

    "<S> cr - doping effect on electrical transport strongly enhances an insulating behavior over a wide range of temperature , while it suppresses a local minimum of thermoelectric power at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> for all polycrystalline samples with cr - substitution , the variable - range - hopping ( vrh ) conduction model gives a reasonable fit to both resistivities and seebeck coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon thermal conduction gradually rises with increasing cr content , which is in contrast to a typical impurity effect on thermal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to a suppression of local lattice distortion through the introduction of jahn - teller inactive ions of cr@xmath5 . </S>"
