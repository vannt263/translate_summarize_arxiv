    "the nlo analyses of the virtual photon structure functions , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , have been made by uematsu and walsh  @xcite and the present authors  @xcite , respectively . in this talk",
    "we will report the result of our investigation of the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) in the virtual photon target .",
