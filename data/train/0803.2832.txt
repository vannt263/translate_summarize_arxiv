    "impurity quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) and associated local non - fermi liquid behavior @xcite presently receive much attention in connection with tunable quantum criticality in mesoscopic devices , the physics of nonmagnetic impurities in cuprate superconductors , and ( via dynamical mean - field theory and its extensions @xcite ) heavy - fermion quantum criticality .",
    "impurity qpts have been studied in several models involving fermionic and/or bosonic baths . in the pseudogap kondo model @xcite , for example",
    ", a depletion of the electronic density of states around the fermi level can destroy the kondo effect that is ubiquitous for metallic hosts . in the bose - fermi kondo model ( bfkm ) , the kondo effect is destroyed by a competing coupling of the impurity spin to a dissipative bosonic bath representing collective excitations of the environment @xcite .    in this work , we study band depletion and dissipation effects together in a _ pseudogap _",
    "the ising - symmetry bfkm hamiltonian is @xmath1 @xmath2 is the local kondo exchange coupling between a local spin-@xmath0 @xmath3 and the fermionic band , while the dissipation strength @xmath4",
    "couples @xmath5 to a bath of bosonic oscillators characterized by a power - law density of states @xmath6 in the pseudogap bfkm , the fermionic density of states has a power - law pseudogap at the fermi level ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 for convenience , we set @xmath9 , in which case the model is fully specified by the exponents @xmath10 and @xmath11 and by the dimensionless couplings @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    the pseudogap bfkm with isotropic couplings to the bosonic bath has been studied via perturbative rg methods @xcite .",
    "such methods break down for ising bosonic couplings , where ( for @xmath14 at least ) , the critical physics occurs at large @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we therefore treat eq .",

    "the transition between the k and fi phases occurs at the fermionic critical point ( fc , solid circle in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , with properties that are well understood . for @xmath23 ,",
    "fc merges with fi and the impurity spin is kondo screened for all @xmath24 .",
    "by contrast , fc merges with k as @xmath25 , and kondo physics is inaccessible for @xmath26 @xcite .    for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",

    "the critical behavior at fc has been reported in @xcite .",
    "near bfc , the imaginary part of the local dynamical susceptibility obeys the scaling form characteristic of an interacting critical fixed point : @xmath36 where @xmath37 measures the distance to criticality , and the exponent @xmath38 governs the vanishing of a crossover scale @xmath39 above which quantum - critical behavior is observed up to nonuniversal energy scales .",
    "we find that the anomalous exponent characterizing critical local - moment fluctuations is @xmath40 independent of @xmath10 , whereas @xmath38 exhibits both @xmath10 and @xmath11 dependence .",
    "knowledge of @xmath41 and @xmath38 is sufficient to determine all critical exponents associated with the response to @xmath34 .",
    "such hyperscaling behavior is expected at an interacting quantum - critical point having an impurity free energy of the form @xmath42 .",
    "for instance , the local magnetization @xmath43 serves as the order parameter for the transition .",
