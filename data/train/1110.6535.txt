    "the accelerating expansion of the universe was first discovered in 1998 by the observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite . as more accurate data are available , it is possible to measure the acceleration and the dynamical mechanism behind the acceleration .",
    "there are three different possibilities for the acceleration .",
    "the first possibility is that a new exotic form of matter with negative pressure , dubbed as dark energy drives the universe to accelerate .",
    "the cosmological constant is the simplest candidate of dark energy which is also consistent with observations , but at odds with quantum field theory .",
    "the second possibility is that general relativity is modified at the cosmological scale , such as dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite .",
    "the third possibility is that the universe is inhomogeneous . in this paper",
    ", we consider the possibility of dark energy only .    in the recent release of the measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peaks at redshifts @xmath7 , 0.6 and 0.73 in the galaxy correlation function of the final data set of the wigglez dark energy survey , @xcite used these three bao data along with the bao data at redshifts @xmath8 and 0.35 measured from the distribution of galaxies @xcite and the measurement of bao at redshift @xmath9 from the six - degree field galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ) @xcite to constrain @xmath0 cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) model .",
    "it was found that the constraints on @xmath0cdm model from the bao data are even better than those from union2 sne ia data @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found that the combination of bao and the seven - year _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( wmap7 ) data gives much better constraints on @xmath0cdm model than the combination of sne ia and wmap7 data does .",
    "this means that the updated bao data @xcite are robust to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "if the constraints on the property of dark energy from bao data are much tighter than those from sne ia data , then we just need to apply bao data only for a faster fitting although sne ia data and bao data are complementary to each other .",
    "the redshifts of bao data span from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , we may expect that bao data catch the dynamical property of dark energy , so it is necessary to study the effects of different observational data and their combinations on the constraints on the equation of state of dark energy . in this paper",
    ", we use a simple dark energy model to test the robustness of bao data , and compare the constraints on the equation of state of dark energy from different data .    the question whether dark energy is just the cosmological",
    "constant remains to be answered .",

    "in addition to studying the effects of different observational data and their combinations on the constraints of cosmological parameters , we also reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy @xmath14 , the deceleration parameter @xmath15 and @xmath16 by using these data sets .",
    "on the other hand , the distance measurements from sne , bao and wmap7 data depend on @xmath14 through double integrations , the process of double integrations smoothes out the variation of @xmath14 . since the hubble parameter @xmath4 depends on @xmath14 through a single integration , the hubble parameter @xmath4 can detect the variation of @xmath14 better than the distance scales and needs to be applied to fit cosmological models .",
