    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) exhibit a remarkable diversity : fluences range from @xmath11 to @xmath12erg @xmath13 , peak energies range from 50kev to an mev , and possibly from the x - ray to the gev band @xcite , and durations extend from about 2 to @xmath14 s ( for the long - duration grbs ) .",
    "this diversity presumably reflects a dispersion in the progenitors and central engine properties .",
    "perhaps the most impressive feature of grbs are their brilliant luminosities and isotropic energy releases approaching the rest mass of a neutron star , @xmath15 erg @xcite .    the quantity of energy imparted to the relativistic ejecta , @xmath16 , and the quality parameterized by the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath17 , are the two fundamental properties of grb explosions .",
    "in particular , extremely high energies push the boundaries of current progenitor and engine models , while low energies could point to a population of sources that is intermediate between grbs and core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the true energy release depends sensitively on the geometry of the ejecta .",
    "if grb explosions are conical ( as opposed to spherical ) then the true energy release is significantly below that inferred by assuming isotropy . starting with grb970508 @xcite",
    "there has been growing observational evidence for collimated outflows , coming mainly from achromatic breaks in the afterglow lightcurves .    in the conventional interpretation",
    ", the epoch at which the afterglow lightcurves steepen ( `` break '' ) corresponds to the time at which @xmath17 decreases below @xmath18 , the inverse opening angle of the collimated outflow or `` jet '' @xcite .",
    "the break happens for two reasons : an edge effect , and lateral spreading of the jet which results in a significant increase of the swept up mass .",
    "many afterglows have @xmath19 days , which are best measured from optical / near - ir lightcurves ( e.g.  @xcite ) , while wider opening angles are easily measured from radio lightcurves ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite inferred @xmath1 for fifteen grb afterglows from measurements of @xmath20 and found the surprising result that @xmath21 is strongly correlated with the beaming factor , @xmath22 ; here , @xmath4 $ ] is the beaming fraction and @xmath21 is the @xmath0-ray energy release inferred by assuming isotropy . in effect , the true @xmath0-ray energy release , @xmath23 is approximately the same for all the grbs in their sample , with a value of about @xmath24 erg ( assuming a constant circumburst density , @xmath25 @xmath26 ) . in the same vein",
    ", broad - band modeling of several grb afterglows indicates that the typical blastwave kinetic energy in the adiabatic afterglow phase is @xmath27 erg , with a spread of about 1.5 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "however , the general lack of high quality afterglow data severely limits the application of the broad - band modeling method .",
    "separately , @xcite and @xcite noted that the afterglow flux at frequencies above the synchrotron cooling frequency , @xmath28 , is proportional to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the fraction of the shock energy carried by electrons and @xmath31 is the energy of the blastwave per unit solid angle .",
    "the principal attraction is that the flux above @xmath28 does not depend on the circumburst density , and depends only weakly on the fraction of shock energy in magnetic fields , @xmath32 . for reasonable conditions ( which have been verified by broad - band afterglow modeling , e.g.  @xcite ) , the x - ray band ( @xmath33 kev ) lies above @xmath28 starting a few hours after the burst .",
    "thus , this technique offers a significant observational advantage , namely the x - ray luminosity can be used as a surrogate for the isotropic - equivalent afterglow kinetic energy .",
    "@xcite find that the x - ray flux , estimated at a common epoch ( @xmath34hr ) , exhibits a narrow distribution of @xmath35 , @xmath36 ; here @xmath37 is the variance of @xmath38 .",
    "taken at face value , the narrow distribution of @xmath39 implies a narrow distribution of @xmath40 .",
    "this result , if true , is quite surprising since if the result of @xcite is accepted then @xmath41 should show a wide dispersion comparable to that of @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite reconcile the two results by the following argument .",
    "the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath8 can be restated as @xmath42 .",
    "thus , @xmath43 .",
    "since @xmath44 ( for a constant @xmath30 ) they express , @xmath45 . given the diversity in @xmath1 @xcite and the apparent narrowness in @xmath39 ( above ) , it would then follow that @xmath8 should be very tightly distributed",
    ".    however , the approach of @xcite makes a key assumption , namely that @xmath8 and @xmath22 are uncorrelated .",
    "this is certainly true when @xmath8 is constant , but the assumption then pre - supposes the answer ! in reality , a correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath46 can either increase or decrease @xmath47 , and this must be addressed directly .",
    "finally , as appears to be the case ( see  [ sec : data ] ) , @xmath48 ) is dominated by bursts with the smallest opening angles , which results in a distinctly different value than the one used by @xcite based only on the observed @xmath1 values .    in this _",
    ", we avoid all these concerns by taking a direct approach : we measure the variance in @xmath49 rather than bounding it through a statistical relation .",
    "we show , with a larger sample , that @xmath50 is not as narrowly distributed as claimed by @xcite , and in fact shows a spread similar to that of @xmath21 . on the other hand , we find that @xmath2 is strongly correlated with @xmath22 .",
    "it is this correlation , and not the claimed clustering of @xmath50 , that results in , and provides a physical basis for the strong clustering of @xmath7 and hence the blastwave kinetic energy , @xmath8 .",
    "in table  [ tab : xray ] we provide a comprehensive list of x - ray observations for 41 grb afterglows , as well as temporal decay indices , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , when available .",
    "in addition , for a subset of the afterglows for which jet breaks have been measured from the radio , optical , and/or x - ray emission , we also include the inferred @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath1 from @xmath20 using the circumburst densities inferred from broad - band modeling , when available , or a fiducial value of @xmath53 @xmath26 , as indicated by the best - studied afterglows ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this normalization for @xmath54 is different from @xcite who used @xmath25 @xmath26 .    for all but one burst we interpolate the measured @xmath39 to a fiducial epoch of 10hr ( hereafter , @xmath55 ) , using the measured @xmath51 when available , and the median of the distribution , @xmath56 when a measurement is not available .",
    "the single exception is grb020405 for which the first measurement was obtained @xmath57 hr , while the inferred jet break time is about @xmath58 hr ( berger et al .  in prep ) . in this case , we extrapolate to @xmath3 hr using @xmath59 for @xmath60 hr and @xmath61 for @xmath62 hr .",
    "we list the values of @xmath55 in table  [ tab : xray2 ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] we plot the resulting distribution of @xmath55 . for comparison",
    "we also show the distribution of @xmath0-ray fluences from the sample presented by @xcite and updated from the literature .",
    "clearly , while the distribution of x - ray fluxes is narrower than that of the @xmath0-ray fluences , @xmath63 , it still spans @xmath64 orders of magnitude , i.e.  @xmath65 . the value of @xmath66 , and all variances quoted below , are calculated by summing the gaussian distribution for each measurement , and then fitting the combined distribution with a gaussian profile .",
    "we translate the observed x - ray fluxes to isotropic luminosities using : @xmath67 we use @xmath68 , the weighted mean value for x - ray afterglows @xcite , and the median redshift , @xmath69 , for bursts that do not have a measured redshift .",
    "the resulting distribution of @xmath2 , @xmath70 , is wider than that of @xmath39 due to the dispersion in redshifts .",
    "we note that this is significantly wider than the value quoted by @xcite of @xmath71 based on a smaller sample . using the same method we find @xmath72 .    in the absence of a strong correlation between @xmath46 and @xmath73 ,",
    "the above results indicate that the distribution of the true x - ray luminosities , @xmath74 , should have a wider dispersion than either @xmath50 or @xmath46 , for which we find @xmath75 @xcite . instead ,",
    "when we apply the individual beaming corrections for those bursts that have a measured @xmath1 and redshift ( see table  [ tab : xray2 ] ) , we find a significantly narrower distribution , @xmath76 .",
    "the reduced variance of @xmath7 compared to that of @xmath50 requires a strong correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath22 , such that bursts with a brighter isotropic x - ray luminosity are also more strongly collimated .",
    "indeed , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : theta ] the data exhibit such a correlation . ignoring the two bursts which are obvious outliers ( 980326 and 990705 ) , as well as grbs 980329 and 980519 , which do not have a measured redshift",
    ", we find @xmath77 .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient between @xmath2 and @xmath46 indicates a probability that the two quantities are not correlated of only @xmath78 . for @xmath79 and @xmath46",
    "we find a similar probability of @xmath80 that the two quantities are not correlated .",
    "thus , as with the @xmath0-ray emission , the afterglow emission also exhibits strong luminosity diversity due to strong variations in @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the mystery of grbs is no longer the energy release but understanding what aspect of the central engine drives the wide diversity of @xmath46 .",
    "we note that there are four possible outliers in the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath22 .",
    "the afterglows of grbs 980326 and 980519 exhibit rapid fading @xcite , which has been interpreted as the signature of an early jet break . however , it is possible that the rapid fading is instead due to a @xmath81 density profile , and in fact for grb980519 such a model indicates @xmath82 , @xmath83 times wider than in the constant density model .",
    "this is sufficient to bring grb980519 into agreement with the observed correlation .",
    "the redshift of grb980329 is not known , but with @xmath84 it easily agrees with the correlation . finally , the x - ray flux and jet opening angle for grb990705 are poorly characterized due to contamination from a nearby source @xcite and a poor optical lightcurve @xcite .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive compilation of early x - ray observations of 41 grbs , from which we infer @xmath55 , the flux in the 210kev band at 10hr . as first pointed by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the afterglow luminosity above the cooling frequency is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the isotropic - equivalent explosion kinetic energy .",
    "more importantly , the flux is independent of the ambient density and weakly dependent on @xmath32 . for all well modeled afterglows ,",
    "the cooling frequency at 10hr is below the x - ray band .",
    "thus , @xmath55 can be utilized to yield information about the kinetic energy of grbs .",
    "earlier work @xcite focussed on statistical studies of @xmath55 and found the very surprising result that it is narrowly clustered . by assuming that the true kinetic energy , @xmath87 , and @xmath46 ( the beaming factor ) are uncorrelated",
    ", the authors deduced that @xmath7 and thus @xmath8 are even more strongly clustered .",
    "however , this approach is weakened by assuming ( in effect ) the answer .",
    "furthermore , the approach of @xcite which relies on subtracting variances is very sensitive to measurement errors . to illustrate this point",
    ", we note @xmath88 for the entire sample presented here , whereas @xmath89 .",
    "thus , @xmath90 may be negative using the statistical approach .",
    "in contrast to the statistical approach , we take the direct approach and estimate the true kinetic energy , @xmath91 , by using the measured @xmath50 and inferred @xmath46 .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that we do not make assumptions of correlations ( or lack thereof ) and more importantly we do not subtract variances .",
    "we directly compute the variance of the desired physical quantity , namely @xmath7 , and find that it is strongly clustered .",
    "@xmath7 is related to the physical quantities as follows @xcite : @xmath92 where @xmath93 here @xmath94 , as well as @xmath95 and @xmath96 depend to some extent on the details of the electron distribution ( power law versus relativistic maxwellian ; the value of power law index , @xmath97 ) .",
    "there is no reason to expect that @xmath7 should be clustered .",
    "however , one can argue that the microphysics should be the same for each grb afterglow , in particular @xmath30 and @xmath97 .",
    "the best studied afterglows appear to favor @xmath98 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , a value also favored by our current theoretical knowledge of shock acceleration ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , as already indicated by the @xmath0-ray observations , there is evidence supporting strong clustering of explosion energies in grbs @xcite .    given these reasonable assumptions ,",
    "a strong clustering of @xmath7 makes sense if the physical quantities that are responsible for @xmath7 are clustered . as can be seen from equation  [ eqn : lx - eb ]",
    ", this would require that @xmath7 be linearly related to @xmath8 .",
    "such a relation is possible if three conditions are met .",
    "first , the afterglow x - ray emission on timescales of 10 hr must be primarily dominated by synchrotron emission ( which is the basis of equation  [ eqn : lx - eb ] ) .",
    "contribution from inverse compton ( ic ) emission , which depends strongly on @xmath54 and @xmath32 @xcite , is apparently not significant .",
    "a possible exception is grb000926 @xcite , but even there the ic contribution is similar to that from synchrotron emission .",
    "third , @xmath97 must be relatively constant ( as one may expect in any case from insisting that the microphysics should not be different for different bursts ) .",
    "for example , changing @xmath97 from a value of @xmath99 to @xmath83 results in @xmath100 ranging from 0.003 to 117 , a factor of 39,000 ! even small changes in @xmath97 , e.g.  from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , result in a factor of 8 change in @xmath100 .",
    "in contrast , some afterglow models yield values of @xmath97 significantly below @xmath103 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , while others have @xmath97 approaching @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "our results , on the other hand , indicate that one should set @xmath9 and attribute apparent deviant values of @xmath97 to external environment or energy injection from the central source .",
    "we end with an interesting conclusion from the results presented here .",
    "since both the prompt and afterglow emission exhibit a strong correlation with @xmath46 , which is determined from late - time observations ( hours to weeks after the burst ) , the resulting constancy of both @xmath104 and @xmath8 , indicates that grb jets must be relatively homogeneous and maintain a simple conical geometry all the way from internal shocks ( @xmath105 cm ) to the epoch of jet break ( @xmath106 cm ) .",
    "this rules out the idea that brighter bursts are due to bright spots along specific lines of sight @xcite , or that grb jets have a strong energy and/or lorentz factor gradient across their surface @xcite .",
    "it is indeed remarkable that the simplest description of jets is fully consistent with the observations .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive sample of x - ray observations of 41 @xmath0-ray burst ( grb ) afterglows , as well as jet opening angles , @xmath1 for a subset with measured jet breaks . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there is a significant dispersion in the x - ray fluxes , and hence isotropic x - ray luminosities ( @xmath2 ) , normalized to @xmath3 hr . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a strong correlation between @xmath2 and the beaming fractions , @xmath4 $ ] . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the true x - ray luminosity of grb afterglows , @xmath5 , is approximately constant , with a dispersion of only a factor of two . since @xmath6 , the strong clustering of @xmath7 directly implies that the adiabatic blastwave kinetic energy in the afterglow phase , @xmath8 , is tightly clustered . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow distribution of @xmath7 also suggests that @xmath9 , that inverse compton emission does not in general dominate the observed x - ray luminosity , and that radiative losses at @xmath10 hr are relatively small . thus , despite the large diversity in the observed properties of grbs and their afterglows the energy imparted by the grb central engine to the relativistic ejecta is approximately constant . </S>"
