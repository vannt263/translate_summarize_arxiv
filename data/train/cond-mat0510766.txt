    "below we write down some special combinations of @xmath89 which we will need in our paper .    additional term ( [ addition ] ) has a form of total derivative .",
    "hence it does not change neither the classical states of the chain nor the classical equations of motion and the real part of classical action on a _ single _ tunneling trajectory .",
    "the only effect of this term to give a tunneling amplitude along each path its on phase factor .",
    "since there are several qps trajectories between two classical states , all having the same real part of tunneling action , these additional phase factors may give rise to destructive interference of tunneling processes , leading to reduction of total matrix element , connecting two classical states .    following ref . @xcite and taking into account complications due to random stray charges we write tight - binding hamiltonian    @xmath91    performing fourier transformation over variable @xmath54 according to @xmath92 we obtain the effective schrdinger equation @xmath93 and twisted boundary condition @xmath94 here parameters @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are described by equation ( [ bwh ] ) ; @xmath98 and @xmath99 are random coefficients which can be expressed in term of random charges @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 here we measure charges @xmath100 in units @xmath4 .",
    "we turn now to generalization of ( [ old_main_res_under_flux_dif_from_pi ] ) for the case of random fluxes in rhombi .",
    "imaginary - time action for this problem is given by equation ( [ old_basic_action ] ) but additional conditions ( [ varphi ] ) should be changed to @xmath103 following the same steps as before we see that to account for disorder in flux piercing the rhombi one should just replace the last term in ( [ old_main_res_under_flux_dif_from_pi ] ) by @xmath104 here @xmath105 .",
    "now we have effective hamiltonians of the chain in presence of disorder . in the rest of the paper we will analyse these hamiltonians in order to find out influence of disorder on the crossover point between @xmath2- and @xmath4-regimes .",
    "in this section we study influence of random stray charges on the on pairing effect in rhombi chain . it is important to note that , generally speaking , even at maximally frustrated point @xmath106 ( in contrast to regular chain ) symmetry properties of schrdinger equation ( [ main_res_random_charge ] ) _ do not _ prohibit @xmath4-supercurrent .",
    "this is due to the fact that asymmetric realizations of random charges with @xmath107 ( and thus @xmath108 ) break symmetry between two tunneling trajectories of a cooper pair within the same rhombus . of course , random charges preserve classical states of the rhombi chain and in a chain with no qps there would be no @xmath4-supercurrent at maximally frustrated point , but full quantum hamiltonian of the chain does not possess corresponding symmetry",
    "nevertheless , we will see later that for typical realizations of random charges and at @xmath109 the @xmath4-supercurrent is small as compared to @xmath2-supercurrent .",
    "the reason for that is as follows : if at least in one rhombi @xmath110 ( or @xmath111 ) then @xmath4-supercurrent is prohibited .",
    "here we start with analysis of general situation of rhombi chain with random charges and @xmath112 and then make some conclusion on disordered rhombi chain in maximally frustrated point .",

    "it turns out that exact value of the critical deflection @xmath5 differs only by @xmath131 from the one obtained by linearization even for the case when at the crossover point @xmath132 .",
    "action ( [ action_x ] ) is nonlocal and looks a bit terrific , but since @xmath133 we can perform hubbard - stratonovich transformation and derive a representation for grand partition function with local action ( after redefinition of time scale according to @xmath134 ) .",

    "namely , if we set @xmath143 @xmath144 then ( [ abab ] ) reduces to @xmath145 and we have only one equation for two parameters @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "this freedom will not be important for us .",
    "in present paper for the reasons described below we will mostly consider action ( [ decoupling ] ) under condition @xmath148 and chose @xmath149    the main feature of the result presented above is that we have reduced original problem including large number of random variables ( @xmath150 ) to a problem with only _ three _ random parameters @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath16 .",
    "more over , since @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath16 arise as sums of large number @xmath13 of independent random variables ( see equation ( [ abc ] ) ) , it is natural to expect that they obey gaussian statistics .",
    "let us assume that parameters @xmath153 and @xmath154 in ( [ q ] ) are uniformly distributed on @xmath155 $ ] .",
    "it corresponds to strong fluctuations of stray charges from sample to sample .",
    "under such an assumption one can easily find @xmath156    our strategy in the rest part of this section will be to analyse properties of the system described by equations ( [ decoupling ] , [ boundary ] ) with _ fixed _",
    "@xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath16 and then make some statistical analysis . under fixed @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath16 the main subject of our investigation will be whether the system is in regime of dominating @xmath2-supercurrent or not .",
    "first of all let us analyze action ( [ decoupling ] ) for a trajectory where @xmath117 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) are constant .",
    "we have @xmath159    this static action has two groups of minima ( we call them even and odd , suppose @xmath160 ) @xmath161 and @xmath162 where @xmath20 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "all these minima correspond to the same value of @xmath163 .",
    "so we have to consider two types of tunnelling trajectories .",
    "trajectories of the first type connect minima of the same group , i.e. `` even - even '' and `` odd - odd '' , and corresponding variation of the variable @xmath78 between minima is @xmath164 , whereas @xmath165 returns to its original value .",
    "trajectories of the second type connect minima of opposite parity ( i.e. opposite signs of @xmath165 ) , and change @xmath78 variable by @xmath166 .",
    "it is not difficult to see from eqs.([fure],[main_res_random_charge],[boundary ] ) , that increment @xmath167 of the variable @xmath78 along tunnelling trajectory is in one - to - one correspondence to the elementary charge transported along the rhombi chain : @xmath168 .",
    "therefore trajectories of the first type lead to @xmath2 - supercurrent , whereas trajectories of the second type produces usual @xmath4-quantized supercurrent . in semiclassical approximation amplitudes of the supercurrent components",
    "are determined primarily by the classical actions on corresponding trajectories : @xmath169 where @xmath170    to find out whether @xmath2-supercurrent dominates in the system , we should compare classical actions on the trajectories of two types described above .",
    "so we examine classical equations of motion for action ( [ decoupling ] ) . for simplicity here we put coefficient @xmath16 to zero .",
    "it can be shown that relatively small @xmath16 of order @xmath171 ( compare to ( [ stat_abc ] ) ) is not important for our future purpose .",
    "@xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174    here we will analyse equations ( [ equation_x ] , [ equation_y ] , [ equation_z ] ) and find analytic expression for the borderline between @xmath4- and @xmath2-regimes under conditions @xmath175 we also present results of numerical computation of the borderline in general situation .",
    "let us start with @xmath4-trajectory .",
    "note that for variables @xmath78 and @xmath165 characteristic frequency is 1 .",
    "let us suppose that on @xmath4-trajectory @xmath78 varies slowly so that characteristic frequency @xmath176 . than we can eliminate @xmath165 and @xmath61 from equations of motion in adiabatic approximation and obtain @xmath177 @xmath178 we see that under conditions ( [ condab ] ) @xmath179 is indeed small .",
    "equation ( [ slow_x ] ) has solution corresponding to @xmath4-trajectory .",
    "@xmath180 classical action on this solution is @xmath181    let us now turn to examination of @xmath2-trajectories . here",
    "we suppose that @xmath78 is a fast variable i.e. @xmath182 .",
    "we can neglect then variation of @xmath165 and @xmath61 on classical trajectory and put @xmath183 , @xmath184 .",
    "this is consistent with boundary conditions for @xmath2-trajectory .",
    "equation for @xmath78 becomes @xmath185 again , due to ( [ condab ] ) , we see that @xmath78 indeed varies fast on @xmath2-trajectory since @xmath186 .",
    "so we find @xmath2-trajectory and corresponding action @xmath187",
    "@xmath188    comparing equations ( [ two_e_action ] ) and ( [ four_e_action ] ) we find the line of crossover between @xmath2- and @xmath4- regimes : the set of points @xmath189 such that @xmath190 .",
    "@xmath191    the result presented above was derived under assumption @xmath148 but proceeding in the same way with @xmath192 one can show that at large @xmath13 nonzero @xmath16 does not affect the crossover line ( [ cross_line ] ) .",
    "therefore in the rest part of this paper we will completely ignore coefficient @xmath16 .",

    "reasonable choice for @xmath217 is @xmath219 or @xmath220 or something else . from ( [ p4e_approx ] )",

    "however one should remember that theory presented above has several limitations . to clarify this question we present here several graphics for @xmath225 at different @xmath11 and @xmath13 together with the boundaries of the validity region of the approximation used ( fig .",
    "[ p4e ] ) .",
    "subplots a ) , b ) , c ) , d ) correspond to different number of rhombi @xmath226 respectively .",
    "solid and dashed lines @xmath227 correspond to different @xmath228 .",
    "dashed lines were obtained with the aid of equation ( [ p4e_approx ] ) relying on the condition @xmath229 whereas solid lines were produced by exploiting equation ( [ prob1 ] ) with @xmath214 determined from numerical calculations .",
    "the validity region should be determined as follows .",
    "first of all , we have used assumption @xmath230 . taking @xmath231 as a criterium for the edge of our validity region",
    "one finds the dash - doted curves on figure [ p4e ] . strictly speaking only those parts of solids curves are valid , which lie under the corresponding dash - doted curves .",
    "now we have to ensure that rhombi chain is in quantum regime , i.e. currents are exponentially small .",
    "simple estimates show that this is true above the doted line on figure [ p4e ] . at large @xmath13",
    "this limitation is very soft .",
    "finally , our approximations are not valid at probabilities @xmath221 very small or very close to unity since they rely on gaussian statistics for quantities @xmath151 and @xmath152 which certainly does not describe rare events .",
    "qualitatively , results presented above can be interpreted as follows : at large @xmath11 phase fluctuations in a single rhombi are weak and this makes random charges inefficient , however in a long chain global supercurrent is still exponentially suppressed . from the analysis presented above one concludes that we can guarantee with high probability existence of dominating , suppressed by quantum fluctuations , @xmath2-supercurrent in long chain ( @xmath232 ) with large @xmath233 and for such a chain critical deflection @xmath234 .",
    "if we compare this result with critical deflection @xmath235 for a regular chain with the same @xmath11 we conclude that the influence of disorder on pairing effect is really small . on the other hand in a regular chain it was possible to obtain critical deflection of order @xmath236 by choosing @xmath237 . for this set of parameters we can not , use our theory quantitatively ; we expect however that qualitatively the same behaviour as described above for larger values @xmath13 and @xmath11 should be observed here as well .",
    "in this section we will discuss briefly influence of regular gates on pairing effect in maximally frustrated rhombi chain .",
    "we suppose that we have a gate , which is capacitively connected to all superconducting islands in one row ( fig .",
    "[ chain ] ) .",
    "let us consider first rhombi chain with no disorder .",
    "our system still can be described by equations ( [ main_res_random_charge ] , [ boundary ] ) , but now @xmath98 and @xmath99 are no more random .",
    "this coefficients can be expressed in terms of the gate voltage according to @xmath238 we will show here that the supercurrent in the chain is rather sensitive to the gate voltage . since the gate voltage enters the problem in a particularly quantum way ( via phases of virtual qps ) , this dependence may provide an experimental test for the quantum nature of chain s state near the maximally frustrated point .",
    "the problem we are considering now is much simpler as compared to the problem of random stray charges discussed above . now our hamiltonian commutes with the total spin of the chain and we can apply semiclassical approximation directly ( e.g. by introducing spin coherent state path integral , c.f .",
    "it s easy to see that the ground state corresponds to the maximal total spin @xmath239 .",
    "after proper redefinition of the time scale we can write imaginary - time action in the form @xmath240 here angles @xmath241 and @xmath242 parameterize coherent states of the spin .",
    "again one easily find two types of tunneling trajectories corresponding to @xmath2- and @xmath4-supercurrents respectively ( e.g. @xmath2-trajectory which connects @xmath243 with @xmath244 and @xmath4-trajectory connecting @xmath243 with @xmath245 ) .",
    "action @xmath246 is a function of @xmath11 and @xmath247 and does not depend on the number of rhombi .    from ( [ s_reg_gate ] )",

    "this immediately leads to @xmath258 on the other hand , on @xmath4-trajectory smallness of @xmath259 allows us to omit @xmath260 in equation for @xmath78 .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    let us now discuss influence of a regular gate on a chain with random stray charges .",
    "we will treat this problem within the same limit as in the previous section : we consider chain which is rather far from the maximally frustrated point in the sense @xmath121 . from the preceding analysis",
    "we know that @xmath2-action is given by equation ( [ four_e_action ] ) .",
    "coefficient @xmath151 acquires now the following form @xmath265 here @xmath266 is the value of @xmath151 at zero external bias . assuming that fluctuations of random charges are strong one easily finds @xmath267 so typical change in @xmath2-action can be estimated as @xmath268 this result differs from the analogous one for a regular ( without offset charges ) chain in two important aspects : i )",
    "we see that change in action is now proportional to @xmath171 instead of @xmath13 ; ii ) variation of the tunnelling action can now be both negative or positive , i.e. applying external voltage we can _ decrease _ @xmath2-supercurrent as well as increase it , depending on the realization of charge disorder . from the above analysis",
    "we conclude that in a disordered chain current modulation by external gates is random and much weaker than in a regular chain , but it is still present and can be used to demonstrate quantum coherence of the tunnelling processes which occur in the chain .",
    "we now consider the effect of randomness in the values of magnetix fluxes through different rombi . just as in the previous section",
    "we start from the grand partition function given by ( [ z ] ) with @xmath269    we presume that fluxes @xmath8 are uniformly distributed on @xmath270 , i.e. probability distribution for @xmath271 is @xmath272 where @xmath273 actually particular form of @xmath274 is not important for us as we assume that @xmath275 and use perturbation theory in @xmath276 .",
    "we are interested in the critical deviation from the maximally frustrated point @xmath109 destroying @xmath2-supercurrent .",
    "therefore we presume that @xmath277 .",
    "in such an approximation we can use equation ( [ tru ] ) to calculate @xmath124 and get effective action for variable @xmath78 @xmath278 @xmath279    at large @xmath13 we can replace @xmath280 in ( [ random_h_action ] ) by its mean value @xmath281 fourier transformation of @xmath282 for small @xmath276 reads @xmath283 again , using the fact that @xmath284 we can perform hubbard - stratonovich transformation and find representation for partition function with local action ( after redefinition of time scale ) @xmath285    [ c][c]@xmath286 [ c][c]@xmath276     note that our formulation of the problem is a bit specific : we fix relative diversity @xmath276 and look for @xmath287 which brings the chain to the point with equal @xmath2- and @xmath4-supercurrents .",
    "discussion of the previous section concerning two types of tunneling trajectories and their connection to components of supercurrent can be literally applied to action ( [ decoupling_random_h ] ) .",
    "so we need to estimate classical action for @xmath4- and @xmath2-trajectories .",
    "problem with @xmath288 was analysed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that @xmath4-supercurrent dominates at @xmath289 while @xmath2-supercurrent  at @xmath290 .",
    "crossover takes place at @xmath291 . from ( [ decoupling_random_h ] )",
    "one can easily see that corrections to classical actions due to nonzero @xmath292 should be of order @xmath293 .",
    "we analyse action ( [ decoupling_random_h ] ) numerically .",
    "results are presented on figure [ random_h ] .",
    "it may come as a surprise , that with this formulation of the problem critical deviation @xmath5 ( determined through mean flux in rhombi ) _ grows _ with @xmath276 .",
    "however , this is quit reasonable since zero deviation from the maximally frustrated point for _ one _ rhombi in a chain immediately prohibits @xmath4-supercurrent . allowing for diversity of fluxes in rhombi",
    "we allow some of the rhombi to be closer to the maximally frustrated point than a `` mean '' rhombi .",
    "this fact causes strong suppression of @xmath4-supercurrent .",
    "so we conclude that randomness in fluxes is not important for the pairing effect , at least if the standard scatter of these fluxes @xmath294 is not too large in comparison with the critical value @xmath295 found for a regular chain , cf.eq.([phi_c_reg ] ) .",
    "in this paper we provide detailed calculations of superconductive current in a long frustrated rhombi chain with quenched disorder .",
    "we have considered two types of disorder : random stray charges and random fluxes in rhombi .",
    "we found that small ( as compared to the critical deflection @xmath201 destroying @xmath2-supercurrent in a clean chain ) fluctuations of fluxes piercing rhombi are not that important for the pairing effect .",
    "main results of our paper concern effect of quenched random stray charges on pairing of cooper pairs . for a chain which is relatively far from the maximally frustrated point in the sense @xmath121 we managed to calculate probability to find the system in the regime with dominating @xmath2-supercurrent .",
    "stray charges , in principal , may significantly affect properties of the rhombi chain . in particular , in such a chain @xmath4-supercurrent exist even at the maximally frustrated point .",
    "however , as we have demonstrated in sec .",
    "iii , at large @xmath11 and @xmath109 probability to find large @xmath4-supercurrent is small .",
    "this result itself is not a great surprise : in a perfectly classical chain stray charges have no effect at all .",
    "more important are two things : i ) it is possible to combine low probability of finding significant @xmath4-supercurrent at the maximally frustrated point with exponential suppression of the supercurrent by quantum fluctuations ; ii ) in a perfectly classical chain critical deflection @xmath5 scales with number of rhombi as @xmath296 ( this can be easily seen from eq .",

    "( [ phi_c_random_charges ] ) .    in sec .",
    "iv we have considered modulation of the supercurrent by capacitively coupled gate . in a regular chain ,",
    "applying gate voltage one suppresses quantum fluctuations of rhombi and _ increases _ the supercurrent .",
    "its dependence on the gate voltage is very strong : change of the _ logarithm _ of the supercurrent is linear in @xmath13 . on the contrary , in a chain with strong random stray charges applying external gate",
    "increase _ or _ decrease _ supercurrent .",
    "dependence of the supercurrent on the gate voltage is now much weaker : typical change of the logarithm of the supercurrent is now proportional to @xmath171 .",
    "still we see that dependence of the current on gate voltage should be measurable .",
