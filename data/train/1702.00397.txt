    "<S> the features of turbulence modulation produced by a heavy loaded suspension of small solid particles or liquid droplets are discussed by using a physically - based regularisation of particle - fluid interactions . </S>",

    "<S> it is shown that sub - kolmogorov particles / droplets modify the energy spectrum leading to a scaling law , @xmath0 , that emerges at small scales where the particle forcing balances the viscous dissipation . </S>",

    "<S> the energy budget in spectral space , extended to account for the inter - phase momentum exchange , highlights how the particle provide an energy sink in the production range that turns into a source at small scales . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the dissipative fluid - particle interaction is found to stall the energy cascade processes typical of newtonian turbulent flows . in terms of particle statistics , clustering at small scale is depleted , with potential consequences for collision models .    particle laden turbulent flows are central in many physical and technological contexts . in astrophysics  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the turbulence is known to influence the aggregation of dust particles in protoplanetary ( accretion ) disks , see  @xcite and reference therein . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in warm clouds , the turbulence controls the growth by condensation of small droplets  @xcite , and ultimately speeds - up rain formation  @xcite . in the combustion of liquid fuels  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the turbulence determines the effectiveness of atomization , evaporation and mixing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these examples show that turbulence strongly interacts with the transported phase . </S>",
    "<S> less understood is the reciprocal effect expected on the basis of the action - reaction principle by which the transported phase alters the turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> an extreme example of this reciprocal effect arises in the environmental context , where small active organisms such as plankton  @xcite or bacteria  @xcite induce small - scale chaotic flows which affects the chemical and the biological activity . </S>",
    "<S> significant alteration of the turbulent flow is also found in bubbly grid - generated flows , @xcite . in general , </S>",
    "<S> significant back reaction effects are expected in all the other contexts mentioned above . concerning in particular technological applications , in a typical diesel engine , </S>",
    "<S> see e.g.  @xcite , the mass of fluid injected per cycle per cylinder in the form of small droplets is about @xmath1 . considering </S>",
    "<S> a four stroke , @xmath2 litre engine with @xmath3 cylinders , back of the envelope calculations immediately give a mass loading of about @xmath4 and a volume fraction of the order of @xmath5 . in modern common - rail injection systems </S>",
    "<S> the diameter of the droplets is about @xmath6 whilst the kolmogorov scale in a combustion chamber can be estimated on the order of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> according to the accepted classification , see   @xcite , the suspension must then be considered dilute ( no direct interaction among droplets ) even though the inter - phase momentum coupling is particularly significant .    among the different regimes of a particle laden flow  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the present communication addresses conditions like those mentioned above where i ) the dimensions of the single suspended particle are much smaller than the relevant macroscopic scale of the turbulent flow , @xmath8 ; ii ) the particles are extremely diluted with negligible direct particle - particle interaction , i.e. the volume fraction is small ; iii ) the mass loading of the suspension ( particle to fluid mass ratio ) is significant , @xmath9 , implying that a considerable particle - induced force is exerted on the flow . in these conditions , beside turbulence - induced particle clustering already observed at small mass loading  @xcite , new phenomena associated to turbulence modulation are expected , defining a still poorly understood realm of multiphase turbulence . in particular , the standard kolmogorov - like paradigm  @xcite , which assumes that the turbulence is forced at large scales and eventually dissipated at small scales with a universal direct energy cascade  @xcite emerging in the inertial range , is expected to fail .    in the new conditions the particle population forces the fluid across the entire range of available scales , posing several new questions concerning the structure and the dynamics of turbulence under significant back - reaction effects . </S>",
    "<S> the first class of questions is methodological : how can the effect of many sub - kolmogorov particles be modelled in a physically consistent manner in direct numerical simulations ( dns ) ? </S>",
    "<S> is a numerical simulation which truly couples the discrete , point - like phase with a continuum fluid feasible with the present state - of - the - art numerical tools ? can the coupling be made realistic yet affordable from the computational point of view ? </S>",
    "<S> are the singularities arising from the coupling amenable of rigorous treatment ? </S>",
    "<S> as will be shown , answers to these methodological issues can be found in the context of a newly designed inter - phase momentum coupling strategy , the exact regularized point particle approach ( erpp )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second family of questions , is more physical : what are the effects of the back - reaction on the turbulence dynamics ? how the disperse phase affects the energy cascade processes and , in turns , the energy spectrum ? </S>",
    "<S> what is the resulting effect of the coupling on the particle population ? can we trust the numerical predictions , particularly at small scales , where most of the particle - fluid interaction is expected to occur ?    </S>",
    "<S> this communication provides an answer to all these questions , discussing the results of new simulations based on the erpp approach that are free of the bias that hampers other available techniques aimed at realising the particle - fluid interaction . among others , the crucial advancements over the present state - of - the - art concern : a ) a physically - based , grid - independent regularisation of the singular response of point - like particles ; b ) the possibility to take a weak limit for the statistics with the regularisation parameter approaching zero ; c ) the ability to exactly remove from the field the unphysical self - induction velocity of each single particle in the calculation of the hydrodynamic force ; d ) the recovery of the exact momentum balance in the force coupling of each particle with the fluid ; e ) the convergence of the coupling scheme also when a fixed number of particles , independent of grid size , is considered .    in order to address these issues in the cleanest form </S>",
    "<S> , the flow should be as simple as possible . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence is the elective choice . </S>",
    "<S> however it requires an external forcing acting at large scales to provide the energy dissipated by viscosity . although this is not an issue for classical newtonian turbulence , the external forcing introduces undesired features in the context of particle laden flows in presence of backreaction . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that , as shown below , the particle forms long clusters spanning the entire range of scales , up to the integral scale . </S>",
    "<S> the external forcing interferes with the large scales of the clusters and their backreaction on the fluid , thereby introducing dynamical artefacts . </S>",
    "<S> a flow able to self - sustain the turbulence with no artificial external forcing which still retains a substantial simplicity , e.g. statistical spatial homogeneity and stationarity , is the homogeneous shear flow , where a linear average shear is enforced on turbulence fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this flow , described in detail in the supplemental material ( sm , @xcite ) , will be exploited below to discuss generic features of particles laden flows under strong loading .    </S>",

    "<S> typically , convergence can be achieved only at constant number of particles per computational cell , implying that the number of particles should increase ( at constant mass loading ) as the grid size is reduced . additionally , the particles are affected by their own self - induced disturbance , which introduces errors in the hydrodynamics force . </S>",
    "<S> this source of error gets more and more pronounced as the number of particles per cell is reduced , as always happens under grid refinement . </S>",
    "<S> these drawbacks do not affect the erpp method where the dirac delta function is regularized in a physically consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> the disturbance due to each point - like particle is evaluated in a closed analytical form exploiting the exact solution of a local unsteady stokes problem and the viscosity of the fluid naturally takes care of regularising the fluid response to the particle forcing . in turbulence , when @xmath10 , is natural to set the regularisation length on the order of the kolmogorov length - scales @xmath16 or below . </S>",
