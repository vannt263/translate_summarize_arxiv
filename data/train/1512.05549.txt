    "of the over 1200 transiting extrasolar planets ( teps ) now known , the short - period gas - giant planets are of particular interest .",
    "these ` hot jupiters ' are the easiest to find due to their deep transits and high orbital frequency , are the most amenable to detailed characterisation due to their large masses and radii , and have highly irradiated and often rarefied atmospheres in which many physical phenomena are observable .",
    "most of the transiting hot jupiters have been discovered by ground - based surveys studying bright stars .",
    "the brightness of the host stars is also extremely helpful in further characterisation of these objects via transmission spectroscopy and orbital obliquity studies .",
    "we are therefore undertaking a project to study teps orbiting bright host stars visible from the southern hemisphere . here",
    "we present transit light curves of four targets discovered by the wasp project @xcite and measure their physical properties and orbital ephemerides to high precision .",
    "wasp-22 was discovered by @xcite , who found it to be a low - density planet ( mass 0.56@xmath0 , radius 1.12@xmath1 ) orbiting a @xmath4 solar - type star every 3.53d . a linear trend in the radial velocities ( rvs )",
    "was noticed and attributed to the presence of a third body in the system , which could be an m - dwarf , white dwarf or second planet .",
    "the trend in the rvs has been confirmed by @xcite , who measured the change in the systemic velocity of the system to be @xmath5ms@xmath6yr@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite measured the projected orbital obliquity of the system to be @xmath7 via the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "wasp-41 was announced by @xcite to be a hot jupiter of mass 0.94@xmath0 , radius 1.06@xmath1 , and orbital period @xmath8d .",
    "its host is a @xmath9 g8v star showing magnetic activity indicative of a young age , and rotational modulation on a period of @xmath10d .",
    "@xcite obtained further spectroscopic rv measurements from which they measured @xmath11  and detected a third object in the system with @xmath12d and a minimum mass of @xmath13@xmath0 .",
    "wasp-42 was discovered by @xcite and is a low - density planet ( mass 0.50@xmath0 , radius 1.12@xmath1 ) orbiting a @xmath14 star of spectral type k1v every 4.98d .",
    "an orbital eccentricity of @xmath15 was found by these authors , which is small but significant @xcite .",
    "no other study of the wasp-42 system has been published .",
    "wasp-55 was one of a batch of new teps announced by @xcite and is the lowest - density of the four planets considered here , with a mass of 0.50@xmath0  and radius of 1.30@xmath1 .",
    "its host is a g1v star with a slightly sub - solar metallicity , and the @xmath16  of the system is 4.47d .",
    "no other study of the wasp-55 system has been published , but it was a target in field 6 of the k2 mission @xcite and these observations will soon be available .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     two of our transit light curves of wasp-41 show clear evidence for spot activity , with one spot crossing event observed on 2015/05/13 and two on 2015/05/17 .",
    "we make the assumption that the spot observed on 2015/05/13 is the same as the second spot observed on 2015/05/17 , as the measured spot radii and contrasts agree , and the resulting stellar rotation period and velocity are highly consistent with previous measurements obtained using different methods .",
    "the change in longitude of the spot then gives a stellar rotation period of @xmath2d and @xmath17 of @xmath18kms@xmath6 , both at a latitude of approximately @xmath19 .",
    "the change in latitude yields a measurement of the sky - projected orbital obliquity of the system of @xmath3 , which is significantly more precise than a previous measurement obtained via the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "spectroscopic measurements of @xmath20 are notoriously difficult for cool stars because the amplitude of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect depends on the @xmath17 of the host star , which is typically very low below @xmath21  values of roughly 5500k .",
    "starspot tracking is a major contributor in this domain , with a total of ten determinations to date ( table[tab : spotlambda ] and fig.[fig : tefflambda ] ) .",
    "the host stars have @xmath21  values between 4645k and 5576k , so are all cool stars where rossiter - mclaughlin measurements are difficult ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but stars often show strong spot activity .",
    "the orbital obliquity of systems containing cool stars is a useful probe of tidal theory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a statistically significant sample of such measurements is both scientifically important and observationally tractable via starspot tracking analyses such as that performed for wasp-41 .",
    "the operation of the danish 1.54 m telescope is financed by a grant to ugj from the danish council for independent research , natural sciences ( fnu ) .",
    "the reduced light curves presented in this work will be made available at the cds ( http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/ ) and at http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk / jkt/. we thank laetitia delrez and marion neveu - vanmalle for providing published light curves of wasp-41 .",
