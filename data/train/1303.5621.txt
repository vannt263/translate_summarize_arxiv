    "viscous fingering , also called saffman - taylor@xcite instability , is considered as an archetype of pattern forming instability ( see couder 2000@xcite for an insightful review ) .",
    "it has also been widely studied in the context of industrial research , such as petroleum extraction in particular .",
    "the phenomenon belongs to the broad family of instabilities of growth in laplacian fields , which includes solidification , aggregation , etc ... it was first studied by saffman and taylor@xcite in 1958 , who observed the formation of patterns upon injection of a fluid into a channel filled with another more viscous fluid .",
    "saffman and taylor@xcite studied the formation of fingers in shallow rectangular channels and observed that the formation of fingers was dependent on the ratio of channel height to channel width .",
    "the extension to radial geometry , depicted in figure [ fig : isopressure]a , dates back to bataille@xcite , wilson@xcite and paterson@xcite .",
    "sketch4 ( 60,24)fluid 2 ( 50,32)fluid 1 ( 44,38)r ( 90,24)h    viscous and capillary forces govern the mechanism of this instability .",
    "the viscosity difference drives the formation of fingers , because emerging fingers enhance the pressure gradients acting in the tip region differentially in each fluid , as illustrated by iso - contours of the pressure field in figure [ fig : isopressure]b , where the inner fluid is assumed inviscid and at constant pressure .",
    "since the interface moves with a velocity proportional to the pressure gradient , the feedback loop is closed . in presence of a positive radial gradient of viscosity across the interface ,",
    "any minute initial displacement will turn unstable , as it induces a pressure gradient difference that further accelerates a protruding finger , which in turn becomes steeper and steeper as it continues to develop .",
    "this instability is damped by surface tension , which acts to minimize the interface area and opposes the formation of curved fingers .",
    "one key parameter that determines the number of fingers is therefore the ratio between viscous effects , represented by the product of the interface velocity @xmath0 and the viscosity @xmath1 , against capillary effects represented by the surface tension @xmath2 .",
    "this ratio is called the capillary number @xmath3 .",
    "a second influential parameter is the aspect ratio @xmath4 ( the origin of the factor @xmath5 is explained section ii ) .",
    "the viscous drag is mainly created by the velocity gradients in the small direction @xmath6 , whereas the capillary forces act on fingers formed along the circumference whose length scales with the radius @xmath7 ( see figure [ fig : isopressure]a ) .    considering a flat front separating fluid @xmath8 to the left from fluid @xmath9 to the right and propagating along the @xmath10 coordinate at a velocity @xmath11 in a rectangular cell of span @xmath12 ( in the direction @xmath13 ) and width @xmath6 ( in the direction @xmath14 ) ,",
    "the above physical reasoning has been made rigorous by deriving a dispersion relation relating the growth - rate @xmath15 of the instability to the wave number of the disturbance @xmath16 , assuming a normal mode expansion @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite could demonstrate that the growth - rate was simply given by : = v - .",
    "this formula perfectly reflects the physical picture above and shows the existence of a most unstable wavelength , resulting from the competition of a destabilization of the viscosity difference and stabilization by surface tension .",
    "a similar situation holds in the circular injection case , as shown by wilson@xcite , who determined the wave number of the fastest growing perturbation : n = , where , for brevity , the injected fluid is considered inviscid and unperturbed .",
    "maxworthy@xcite showed experimentally that this prediction works well for low capillary numbers but does not reproduce the behavior at elevated capillary numbers @xmath18 .",
    "both chuoke _ et al_s@xcite and wilsons@xcite predictions are based on the darcy equation , which is the classical hele - shaw limit of the stokes equation for large aspect ratios . in this limit only viscous terms in the thin direction",
    "are retained .",
    "the flow in the thin direction is approximated by a poiseuille profile and the equations can be depth - averaged in the shallow direction .",
    "this leads to the darcy equation , which is a two - dimensional potential flow , where the pressure represents the potential .",
    "one paradox of this model was pointed out by dai and shelley@xcite , who argued that for zero surface tension the fingers would form infinitely sharp cusps .",
    "paterson@xcite assumed that for zero surface tension flows , for instance with two miscible fluids , the interface is influenced by the full three - dimensional stress tensor .",
    "he used a potential flow for which he derived the 3d stress tensor at the fluid - fluid interface and looked for the perturbation wavelength that minimizes the dissipated energy , thereby using the property that low reynolds number flows minimize the dissipation .",
    "he found the finger size @xmath19 to be solely dependent on the cell height @xmath6 in the form @xmath20 .",
    "this matches quite well the relation homsy@xcite deduced from maxworthy s results : @xmath21 .",
    "a similar dissipation minimization approach was recently followed by boudaoud _",
    "@xcite , both for 2d darcy and 2d stokes suction flows .",
    "kim et al.@xcite developed a dispersion relation using viscous potential flow where the normal stress boundary condition includes not only pressure but also viscous normal stresses .",
    "their result improved the agreement with maxworthy s experiment even at capillary numbers of order one . in this work",
    "the brinkman equation is used as a model for confined flows .",
    "the brinkman equation retains in - plane stress terms and is therefore of second order , which allows boundary conditions for the normal and tangential velocities at the fluid - fluid interface .",
    "following the same steps as paterson@xcite in his article for radial fingering using darcy equations , we are able to show that the finger prediction in the range from low to high capillary numbers is improved .    in a recent work logvinov et al.@xcite used the brinkman equation to describe the saffman - taylor instability of miscible fluids , hence with zero surface tension , in rectangular channels and demonstrate the influence of viscous effects in the flow plane .",
    "they found a wavelength dependence that is about @xmath22 , which is still by a factor 2 too small compared to the experiment .",
    "earlier , fernandez _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite as well as carls _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite have also used the brinkman equation to analyze rayleigh taylor instability in hele - shaw cells .",
    "the next section [ problem ] presents first the brinkman model and thereafter the stability analysis in section [ rdd ] . in section [ results ]",
    "the results are shown and compare to existing theoretical and experimental results .",
    "the paper ends by section [ conclusion ] , where conclusions and perspectives are drawn .",
    "the flow geometry under consideration is a hele - shaw cell , a space confined between two plates , whose distance is generally in the order of a millimeter .",
    "the cell is filled with a viscous liquid and in the center is a second fluid of smaller viscosity with a uniformly circular interface . as the injection of more fluid in the center",
    "is started the front advances and the instability is triggered .",
    "this configuration is schematically depicted in figure [ fig : isopressure]a .",
    "the brinkman equation is used as a model for the fluid motion in this study .",
    "starting from the 3d stokes equation , it is assumed that the velocity component in the thin direction is zero and the velocity profiles in the plane direction are poiseuille profiles ( see boos and thess 1996@xcite and gallaire _",
    "et al . _ 2013@xcite for more details",
    ") . under this condition one can integrate in the small direction and obtains depth - averaged equations that combine viscous effects in the plane like in the 2d stokes equation and the viscous friction due to confinement from top and bottom wall like in the darcy equation .",
    "the parameter related to the aspect ratio that comes from depth averaging is given as @xmath4 , where @xmath7 is the initial radius and @xmath6 the height of the cell .",
    "this gives @xmath5 because the derivative of the parabolic velocity profile in the thin direction is gives @xmath23 , since averaged quantities are used one multiplies with the maximum to mean velocity , which is @xmath24 for a parabola .",
    "in constant flux @xmath25 radial injection , the interface evolves as @xmath26 . for the non - dimensionalisation , using the undisturbed instantaneous radius of the interface @xmath27 , the flow rate @xmath25 , the viscosity of the outer fluid @xmath28 .",
    "this defines the non - dimensional viscosity @xmath29 in eq.([fct : brman ] ) as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this further defines following characteristic velocity and pressure : @xmath32 the non - dimensional brinkman equation then reads _",

    "the bottom index corresponds to @xmath35 for the inner fluid and @xmath36 for the outer flow .",
    "given the geometry of the problem it is convenient to write the brinkman equation in polar coordinates : @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote respectively the radial and azimuthal velocity components .",
    "with help of the stream function , @xmath41 , a more compact form is obtained by taking the curl of eq.([fct : brinkrad1 ] ) and eq.([fct : brinkrad2 ] ) : ( r+ ) ( r+ - k^2 ) = 0 .",
