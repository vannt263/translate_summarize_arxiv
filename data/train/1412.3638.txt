    "energy bands with a nontrivial geometry in momentum space are currently of great interest in many fields of physics .",
    "the berry curvature is a geometrical property of an energy band which can be viewed as an artificial magnetic field in a general effective quantum hamiltonian where the roles of momentum and position are reversed@xcite .",
    "this has important physical consequences in the anomalous hall effect@xcite , in the collective modes of an ultracold atomic gas@xcite and in the semiclassical dynamics of a wave packet@xcite .    local geometrical properties , such as the berry curvature , can also be related to global topological invariants , underlying the quantum hall effect@xcite and topological insulators@xcite .",
    "thanks to recent advances , geometrically nontrivial energy bands have now been created in photonic systems@xcite and ultracold gases@xcite , where the berry curvature@xcite and topological invariants@xcite have been measured directly .",
    "the consequences of the berry curvature as a momentum - space magnetic field have been well - studied semiclassically@xcite , but the general effective hamiltonian can also be exploited as a fully quantum theory@xcite . the effective hamiltonian describes a single particle in a geometrically nontrivial energy band with an additional external potential .",
    "consequently , analogue magnetic phenomena in momentum space can be explored in the quantum mechanics of single particles in a wide - range of systems ; for example , the eigenstates of the harper - hofstadter model in an external harmonic trap can be recognised as landau levels on a torus in momentum space in certain parameter regimes @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that a momentum - space effective magnetic hamiltonian captures many key features of a single particle in two dimensions with spin - orbit coupling , a zeeman field , and an additional harmonic trap .",
    "spin - orbit - coupled systems are an important area of current theoretical and experimental research @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have realised one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin - orbit coupling in an ultracold gas @xcite , while various extensions to two dimensions have been proposed@xcite . at the single particle level ,",
    "the effective momentum - space magnetic hamiltonian has previously been applied to a system with spin - orbit coupling and a harmonic trap , but without a zeeman field @xcite .",
    "the addition of a zeeman field considerably enriches the single - particle phase diagram , revealing a wealth of analogue magnetic phenomena . in this paper ,",
    "we show , for example , that the effective hamiltonian can be mapped onto either a fock - darwin hamiltonian or a 1d ring pierced by a tuneable magnetic flux in momentum space depending on the regime of parameters . in real space , a ring pierced by a magnetic flux supports equilibrium persistent currents even in the ground state ; we discuss too how this phenomenon has a direct analogy in momentum space .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following .",
    "first , we introduce the effective momentum - space magnetic hamiltonian for a general system , then we present the model of a spin - orbit - coupled spin-1/2 particle in two dimensions with a zeeman field and a harmonic trap .",
    "we focus separately on the quantum mechanics of a particle in two parameter regimes ; firstly , when the effective hamiltonian is analogous to the fock - darwin hamiltonian , and secondly , when the momentum - space physics can be understood as that of a 1d ring pierced by a tuneable magnetic flux .",
    "we then extend this discussion to higher spin systems , and finally , explore experimental considerations for observing these analogue magnetic effects .",
    "the effective momentum - space magnetic hamiltonian can be derived from a generic hamiltonian : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is either translationally invariant or periodic in real space and @xmath2 , is a weaker additional potential . for the purposes of this paper",
    ", @xmath1 will describe an atom with spin - orbit coupling , with an additional harmonic trap , @xmath3 , of trapping strength @xmath4 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath1 for band index @xmath5 and momentum @xmath6 are @xmath7 .",
    "we write these as @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the normalizing volume , to give the bloch states @xmath10 which have a position dependence that is spatially periodic .",
    "( we set @xmath11 throughout . ) for the spin - orbit - coupled systems of this paper , @xmath1 is translationally invariant",
    ". then the bloch state , @xmath10 , is a spinor , @xmath12 , which is independent of position .",
    "( the case when @xmath1 is periodic in real space was previously discussed in ref .   and references within . )",
    "the energy bands of @xmath1 are characterised both by an energy dispersion , @xmath13 , and by the geometrical properties of the eigenstates making up the band . in this paper , we focus on two dimensional systems , although the extension to geometrical properties in three dimensions ( 3d ) is straightforward .",
    "these geometrical properties are encoded in the berry connection , @xmath14 , and berry curvature , @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16 we note that while the berry connection is gauge - dependent , the berry curvature is independent of the gauge choice .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath1 are used as a basis in which to expand the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian , @xmath17 , as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are expansion coefficients . in general , the additional potential , @xmath2 , mixes different states , @xmath20 .",
    "however , provided that the additional potential is sufficiently weak that it does not significantly couple different energy bands , we can assume that the occupation of only band , @xmath5 , is non - negligible .",
    "under this so - called single - band approximation , the effective quantum hamiltonian is : @xmath21 , \\label{eq : key}\\ ] ] which is equivalent to a magnetic hamiltonian with the roles of position and momentum reversed . in particular",
    ", the berry connection , @xmath22 , acts like a magnetic vector potential in momentum space , redefining the relationship between the canonical position , @xmath23 and the physical position @xmath24 @xcite .    to illustrate the duality between real - space and momentum - space magnetism even more clearly",
    ", we focus hereafter on the case of an additional harmonic trap @xmath3 .",

    "we note that the limit of a vanishing zeeman field is captured by @xmath40 while @xmath41 is kept finite .      without a harmonic trap ,",
    "the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath1 , which has two energy bands@xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the band indices . for all parameters , the upper band , @xmath44 ,",
    "has a single minimum at @xmath45 .",

    "[ htdp ] @xmath50    without a zeeman field , the lower band is always in the ring minima regime , and the two energy bands are degenerate at @xmath45 . introducing a zeeman field lifts the degeneracy and breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "then the berry curvature is non - zero and can be calculated from the spinor eigenfunction of the lower band : @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the polar coordinates in momentum space . the berry curvature ( [ eq : berrydef ] )",
    "is  @xcite : @xmath53 this is plotted schematically in figure [ fig : scales ] .",

    "this separation of scales is displayed in the numerical energy spectrum in figure [ fig : overview ] .",
    "as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ eq : enmcin ] , the magnitude of these energy scales is controlled by @xmath124 , which measures the strength of the harmonic trap relative to the zeeman field . in the effective hamiltonian ,",

    "this is because we have assumed that the system is well described by an effective mass and a uniform berry curvature , both defined at the minimum @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , there will be higher order terms which are not captured by our analytical fock - darwin spectrum ( [ eq : enmcin ] ) .",
    "we expand both the effective mass approximation and the berry curvature to next highest order , assuming that the eigenstates vary on the characteristic momentum scale , @xmath134 .",
    "the next - order corrections scale as : @xmath135 which decrease as @xmath136 .",

    "our analytical interpretation therefore best describes numerics when the parameters are small .",

    "this is because there is a transition in this limit between the single minimum and ring minima regimes where the effective mass , @xmath139 .",
    "the divergence of the effective mass is analogous to a vanishing harmonic potential in the real - space fock - darwin hamiltonian ( [ eq : fdreal ] ) , where the fock - darwin states tend towards landau levels .",
    "however , as seen from the corrections discussed above , the energy dispersion also provides an effective quartic trapping in momentum space , which does not vanish as @xmath138 .",

    "_ ring minima regime_the momentum - space magnetic flux can be measured in the dependence of the single - particle energy spectrum on @xmath67 . in general , the energy splitting of states with @xmath119 and @xmath120 is maximal when the zeeman field is tuned to zero , then it is @xmath334 . for a spin-1/2 particle",
    "we require that @xmath335 , and so the splitting can be up to : @xmath336 . for a higher spin @xmath280 particle ,",
    "the system is in regime 3 discussed above for a vanishing zeeman field and the single - band approximation requires that eq .",
    "[ eq : regime3 ] is satisfied . as a result",
    "the maximum splitting between states with @xmath119 and @xmath120 is : @xmath337 which can be a significant percentage of the harmonic trapping frequency for suitable values of @xmath67 .",
    "another key experimental signature of the momentum - space artificial magnetic flux is the characteristic jumps in the azimuthal angular momentum of the ground state as a function of momentum - space magnetic flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig : higher ] ) .",
    "these transitions could be inferred , for example , from the variation in the ground state energy with the flux .    as in real - space rings",
    ", the momentum - space magnetic flux induces equilibrium persistent  currents \" around the ring of minima even when the azimuthal angular momentum quantum number @xmath192 .",
    "physically , the origin of this analogue magnetic phenomenon is from the balance of different spin components in the ground state , which carry different amounts of angular momentum .",
    "persistent currents in momentum space could be investigated , for example , in the semiclassical dynamics of a wavepacket .",
    "we assume the wavepacket is prepared at an angle , @xmath338 , on the 1d ring in momentum space , and centred around an angular momentum , @xmath339 .",
    "in the semiclassical approximation , the wavepacket moves around the momentum space ring at a rate : @xmath340 for a wavepacket centred around @xmath341 , this increases as @xmath342 . in units of the trap frequency ,",
    "the rate at which the wave packet moves around the momentum space ring of minima scales as @xmath343 in the limit of a vanishing zeeman field for a spin-1/2 particle . to justify our approximations",
    ", we also require that @xmath344 in the same limit , as discussed above .",
    "then the rate would be @xmath345 .",
    "alternatively , persistent currents could be studied via the real - space angular momentum of the wave function or inferred from measuring the number of atoms in the different spin components .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that a single - particle with 2d spin - orbit coupling in a weak external harmonic trap can be described by an effective hamiltonian in which the berry curvature acts as an artificial momentum - space magnetic field .",
    "when the spin - orbit coupling strength is weak compared to the zeeman field , the effective hamiltonian is analogous to that of the fock - darwin hamiltonian for a particle in a real space harmonic trap and uniform magnetic field . from this analogy , we have translated results more usually applied to quantum dots to describe the momentum - space properties of a spin - orbit - coupled atom .    in the opposite limit of strong spin - orbit coupling or a weak zeeman field ,",
    "we have shown that the effective hamiltonian is analogous to that of a particle confined to a 1d ring pierced by a real - space magnetic flux .",
    "guided by this , we identify magnetic phenomena in momentum space , including a contribution to the energy spectrum which is ( almost ) periodic as a function of flux and persistent  currents \" around the momentum - space ring of energy minima .",
    "we have also extended our approach to higher spin systems , and discussed relevant experimental considerations for observing these effects .",
    "we consider a higher - spin system with a single - particle hamiltonian without a harmonic trap , of the form : @xmath346 where @xmath347 is the @xmath348-th component spin matrix with total spin @xmath280 .",
    "we note that this is not the most general form of a higher - spin hamiltonian , but can naturally include both the zeeman field and rashba spin - orbit coupling in the vector @xmath349 .",
    "the factor of @xmath350 in the second term of the hamiltonian is inserted for convenience without loss of generality .",
    "choosing the quantization axis of the spin along @xmath351 ( called here the @xmath352-axis ) , the hamiltonian is : @xmath353 where the matrix @xmath354 has the following form : @xmath355 the energy of the @xmath5-th band is : @xmath356 where @xmath357 . for the specific case of rashba spin - orbit coupling with a zeeman field ,",
    "the vector @xmath358 and the energy of the @xmath5-th band is @xmath359 as is used in the main text .    to calculate the berry curvature , we express the @xmath5-th band eigenstate of the general higher spin system in terms of a series of rotations from the spin - quantization axis , @xmath352 : @xmath360 where @xmath361 and the angles , @xmath247 and @xmath362 are the spherical polar coordinate angles of @xmath351 .",
    "the derivatives of @xmath363 can be expressed as : @xmath364e^{-i\\theta f_y } |m_\\alpha\\rangle ,      \\notag \\\\",
    "\\left| \\frac{\\partial u_\\alpha}{\\partial p_y}\\right\\rangle      & =      -i e^{-i\\phi f_z }      \\left [      \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial p_y}f_z        + \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p_y } f_y      \\right]e^{-i\\theta f_y } |m_\\alpha\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the berry curvature for the @xmath5-th band is : @xmath365      \\notag \\\\      & =      -      \\left (      \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p_x}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial p_y }      -\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial p_x}\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p_y }",

    "therefore : @xmath372 for the specific case of a particle with rashba spin - orbit coupling and a zeeman field , the rotation angles can be calculated from @xmath373 as : @xmath374 hence the berry curvature of the @xmath5-th band is@xcite : @xmath375 as stated in the main text .",
