    "the environment at the ilc is primed for analyses of precision measurements of higgs couplings .",
    "the analysis of the decay @xmath1 is an ideal opportunity to study the yukawa couplings of the second generation in a clean environment and complement the recoil method measurement of this coupling by taking advantage of the large branching fraction of the decay of the z boson to neutrinos .",
    "in addition to the physics interest , the decay of @xmath2 in an otherwise ( almost ) empty detector permits precision studies of the tracking performance and is used for detector benchmarking .",
    "in absence of fully reconstructed events this analysis was carried out on events generated by pythia 6.4@xcite and using the fast detector simulation in the org.lcsim framework .",
    "events were simulated with the sid01 version of the sid detector concept@xcite . for the classification of events we used the tmva@xcite libraries that provide a variety of multi - variate classifiers .",
    "events in the signal sample are computed with either of the two diagrams in figure  [ fig : signal ] .",
    "the fraction of events in the signal sample containing a z boson is 16.2% , the other 83.8% contain neutrinos from the vector boson fusion diagram .",
    "a mixture of different decays containing a pair of muons in the final state make up the background sample .",
    "the different samples and their cross - sections at an energy of 500 gev in the center - of - momentum system are listed in table  [ tab : backgrounds ] .",
    ".considered processes and their cross - sections as obtained from pythia 6.4 [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "since the other variables available to us do not exhibit clear distinctive features between signal and background , a square cut would reduce the signal efficiency to unacceptable levels . with the help of multivariate classifiers ,",
    "we take advantage of the full statistical information available to us . splitting the data sample into a training and a validation set , and providing the classifier with a number of variables in the training",
    "set results then in the optimal case in maximally separated signal and background classes . in this analysis , we found that boosted decision trees ( also called `` random forest '' )  @xcite exhibit the best performance of the available classifiers and indeed outperform the more commonly used neural nets . with the following set of input variables ,",
    "we achieve a classification of signal events with a statistical significance of 1.85 sigma .",
    "figure  [ fig : massplot ] shows a stack of the distributions of the di - muon invariant mass for each of the samples after cuts .",
    "l0.45        * opening angle of the muon pair * missing momentum * @xmath3 for each muon * energy for each muon * transverse momentum for each muon * whether the muons traversed barrel or endcap * ratio of the muon energies * ratio of @xmath4 of the muons",
    "we have presented the status of the analysis of the decay @xmath0 in the framework of a fast simulation of the sid01 detector .",
    "we expect to improve upon the achieved signal significance of 1.85 sigma by including a larger sample and by adding a maximum likelihood fit for the signal extraction .",
    "this study was carried out at a collision energy of 500 gev .",
    "events mediated by the s - channel diagram  [ fig : zh ] are easier to separate from background , because the missing mass exhibits a peak at the nominal z mass .",
    "the fraction of these events in the signal sample is 16.2% at 500 gev . for the loi benchmarking effort",
    ", the analysis will be repeated at a collision energy of 250 gev , reducing the relative fraction of t - channel events in the signal sample to 16.0% .",
    "the authors would like to expresses thanks to the org.lcsim development team for producing a stable simulation and reconstruction framework for future linear colliders .",
