    "hubble , asca , chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ and their superior sensitivity , resolution and energy bandwidth showed that @xmath12 of agn exhibit signatures of such outflows in their optical , uv and/or x - ray spectra .",
    "of these the high resolution long x - ray observations of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ are of particular interest because they discovered transitions that span a range of @xmath13 in ionization parameter , @xmath8 , ( such as  through among others ) and therefore sample a very broad range of conditions for the column density and velocity of plasma along the observers line of sight ( los ) .",
    "the fact that the plethora of these transitions spanning 5 decades in @xmath8 is squeezed within roughly 1.5 decades of frequency , underscores the utility of x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "the first signature of x - ray absorbing plasma in agn was that in the _ einstein _ spectrum of the qso mr 2251 - 178 @xcite , attributed to ",

    "these are of interest because the presence of ionized absorbing gas of a very wide range of @xmath8 along the observers los , offers the opportunity of mapping the spatial distribution of this gas : one can easily see that the knowledge of @xmath8 ( from the presence of certain ionic species ) and the measurement of their hydrogen equivalent column @xmath23 in the observed spectrum can provide a measure of the absorbing gas density dependence on the distance from the continuum source along the observer s los .",
    "such information is extremely valuable in assessing the global properties of the winds which presumably give rise to the observed absorbers .    a quantitative",
    ", more systematic formal way of implementing the above procedure is to construct the absorption measure distribution ( amd ) , namely the hydrogen - equivalent column of specific ions per decade of @xmath8 ; i.e. @xmath24 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the presence of uv absorption features in the spectra of agns that exhibit x - ray was ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests a physical link between these components , which at present is not completely understood .    in parallel with the high resolution observations discussed above , a number of lower resolution ccd x - ray observations of radio - quiet seyferts and bal qsos have discovered absorption features identified as highly - ionized iron ( primarily /  at energies @xmath34 kev in the source frame ) of column densities ( @xmath35 @xmath18 ) , generally higher than those of their moderately - ionized ions at higher ( blueshifted ) velocities ( @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the speed of light ) , coined ultra - fast outflows ( ufos ; @xcite ) .",
    "these are seen across different agn populations such as seyferts , bal qsos and non - bal qsos @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that similar features ( ufos ) have also been reported in radio - loud seyferts such as 3c  111 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that these high outflow velocity transitions represent a generic feature of agn rather than one associated with a specific agn subclass .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a bal qso apm  08279 + 5255 , @xcite have noted a likely correlation between x - ray photon index @xmath38 and the measured outflow velocity of , implying additional underlying physics pertaining to the velocities of these absorbers .",

    "* ) which demands low ionization for this gas so that line radiation pressure driving be efficient ; as such , they lend support to magnetic driving for these flows .",
    "the recent discovery of the ufos in radio - loud seyferts exhibiting jets @xcite seems also to challenge a simplistic _ wind - jet dichotomy _ that associates  winds \" with radio quiet agn and  jets \" with the radio loud ones , perhaps implying a multi - component gas in the same outflowing plasma across these broad agn classes . with",
    "little simultaneous x - ray - radio studies having been conducted so far in radio - loud agns , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t12b ) did perform such a combined study of the x - ray ufos and the vlba radio jet of the radio galaxy 3c  111 ; their simultaneous presence in this object has indicated that these components can actually coexist in agn .",

    "* hereafter t12c ) have analyzed x - ray data from 35 radio - quiet seyferts to obtain a number of correlations between @xmath8 , @xmath25 and @xmath9 of these components that argue in support of a single physical entity underlying the nature of was and ufos .",
    "similar absorption features have been observed and studied intensively in binary systems including transient black hole ( bh ) candidates and neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "these exhibit typically highly ionized plasma ( e.g. si , s , mg , ar and fe ) of @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath18 at typical outflow velocities ranging from @xmath43 km  s@xmath20 to @xmath44 km  s@xmath20 , i.e. properties similar to those of agn but with lower velocities and more highly ionized species .",
    "recently , however , @xcite found an extremely fast ( @xmath45 ) ionized outflow based on the  k - shell signature from _",
    "suzaku_/xis observations of a transient x - ray source , igr  j17091 - 3624 .",
    "this is currently the fastest x - ray wind known in galactic binaries .",

    "* ) and h  1743 - 322 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , exhibit relativistic radio jets akin to those of radio - loud seyferts .",
    "in particular these two components of outflows , x - ray absorbers and radio jets , appear to be anti - correlated : x - ray winds seem to be suppressed in the low / hard state of these objects which favor the presence of radio jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also , vlba monitoring of jet emission combined with simultaneous _ rxte _ observations of low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( lfqpos ) seems to imply that the jet ejection is anti - correlated with the disk activity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for utilizing qpos as a proxy of disk activity in h  1743322 ) .",
    "these observations are suggestive of a mutual interplay between the disk ( where x - ray outflows are also launched ) and jet production .    in an effort to place",
    "the ensemble of these facts into the broader unifying context of accretion flows onto compact objects and their associated winds , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter fkcb10a ) have considered the photoionization of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) accretion - disk winds .",
    "motivated by the observed broad range of the wa and ufo ionization parameter and velocity range , they opted for self - similar models of mhd winds , as they naturally cover many decades in radius . since their enunciation by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , bp82 ) , these winds have been the subject of many studies both semi - analytical ( bp82 ; @xcite , hereafter cl94 ; @xcite , hereafter kk94 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and fully numerical @xcite .",
    "a crucial hint for the choice of a specific model has been the value of the parameter @xmath46 in the amd relation ( the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath8 ) , since this determines the run of the wind density with distance .",
    "clearly , observations favor density profiles close to @xmath47 , a value significantly different from that of the winds of bp82 ( which imply @xmath48 ) and at significant odds with radiation driven outlflows ( which , for @xmath8 approaching its asymptotic value @xmath49 , imply @xmath50 and hence @xmath51 ) .",
    "the important features of these density profiles is their almost constant ( or slowly - decreasing ) column density per decade of radius and their linear decrease of @xmath8 with distance @xmath6 , a fact that determines that high ionization ions have higher velocities than the lower ionization ones , in agreement with observation .",
    "the models of fkcb10a reproduce these features yielding velocities @xmath43 km  s@xmath20 for the moderately ionized species of  and @xmath52 km  s@xmath20 for the highly ionized ions of .",
    "this work was extended by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fkcb10b ) , which demonstrated the model s broad applicability by successfully modeling the combined x - ray ufos and uv broad absorption features of the bal qso apm  08279 + 5255 @xcite ; this was achieved by adjusting only the relative normalization of the uv and x - ray fluxes to those appropriate for bal qsos .",
    "our to date publications of the subject ( fkcb10a / b ) , presenting the first attempt in this specific direction , have employed a single set of wind parameters implying an identical magnetic field geometry in both cases .",
    "the goal of the present work is to remedy this deficiency by an exploration of the wind geometry and ionization through a parameter search , having in mind the x - ray and radio agn observations ( t12b ; t12c ) , with the underlying theoretical framework still based on the work of cl94 . in ",
    "2 we summarize the basics of mhd accretion - disk wind models that has been previously applied for comparison with the observed x - ray was ( fkcb10a ) and ufos ( fkcb10b ) . in ",
    "3 we present our results and demonstrate a relevance of the outflows in a number of situations where those winds could provide a substantial impact on the surrounding environment , and we discuss the implications of our results in  4 with a comparison with bp82 winds in the appendix .",
    "as well known , the structure of axisymmetric mhd flows is determined by the magnetic flux function @xmath53 ( see e.g. cl94 , @xcite ) . as discussed earlier , the broad range of the observed @xmath8 and @xmath9 of absorption features suggests a power law form of all physical quantities with the radial coordinate @xmath6 ; as a result we assume for @xmath53 the following separation of variables @xmath53 in the power - law form of spherical radius @xmath6 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a self - similar index and @xmath56 is the magnetic flux normalization at innermost radius @xmath57 at which our scaling is assumed to be valid and @xmath58 the angular dependence of this function that has to be determined numerically .",
    "we provisionally assume @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is the schwarzschild radius ) , the value of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the geometry .",
    "we make this choice based on the high velocities ( @xmath61 ) observed in certain objects , with the understanding that those of our results pertaining to these innermost radii may not be accurate .",
    "however , we do not expect this assumption to affect the wind structure at the much larger scales covered by the observations .    with the above choice for @xmath62 the magnetic field strength , velocity ,",
    "number density and total pressure take the following form @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is proton mass and @xmath66 is dimensionless polytropic constant related to plasma entropy .",
    "all the dimensionless angular - dependent functions denoted by _",
    "tilde _ must be numerically obtained from the conservation equations as the solution to the grad - shafranov equation with initial values on the disk at @xmath67 to which all the quantities are normalized as denoted by the subscript  o \" . the magnetized wind is also characterized by its plasma @xmath68 defined as the ratio of thermal to magnetic field pressures @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the polytropic index of the wind plasma .",
    "we note that its los radial - dependence drops out in our framework since @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    under",
    "steady - state axisymmetric conditions there are five conserved quantities along a streamline of given @xmath53 ; i.e. the particle flux to magnetic flux ratio @xmath3 , the angular velocity of field lines @xmath73 , the total angular momentum of the plasma @xmath4 , the total energy ( bernoulli function ) @xmath74 and the entropy @xmath75 ( see cl94 for details ) . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are defined as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are respectively poloidal velocity and magnetic field while @xmath79 and @xmath80 are respectively azimuthal velocity component and magnetic field strength .",
    "we assume the disk threaded by the magnetic field to be infinitely thin , so we define boundary conditions at the point @xmath81 where @xmath82 with only a small component @xmath83 perpendicular to the disk surface [ @xmath84 . for a given set of @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    "a trans - alfv@xmath5n  wind solution can be obtained when the initial magnetic field line orientation @xmath87 is met with the regularity condition . with these constraints , @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    "are dependent quantities constrained by @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( see cl94 and fkcb10a ) ; i.e. @xmath90/2 - 1/2 - \\omega_o \\ , \\label{eq : j } \\ ] ] where @xmath91 characterizes",
    "the angle the poloidal field / flow lines make with the disk at their footpoints ( readers can easily verify that this angle is equal to @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 at the launching radius @xmath57 ( see cl94 for details ) .",
    "we thus find that , for a given @xmath55 , the wind structure is primarily governed by @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; the goal of the present study is to determine the structure and observable properties ( i.e. column density , los velocity as a function of angle ) of these winds and their relation to observations .",
    "specifically , the value of @xmath85 is generally responsible for determining the wind kinematics while @xmath86 plays an important role in shaping its poloidal structure .",
    "note that one must adjust either @xmath85 or @xmath86 for a given initial poloidal angle of the magnetic field in order for winds to become super - alfv@xmath5nic  ( see the appendix for discussion on viability for our choice of parameter sets ) .",
    "although the other model parameters ( see cl94 and fkcb10a ) are also coupled to and affect the wind properties , we find them to be fundamentally less significant compared to @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the magnetic and velocity fields can be decomposed explicitly in poloidal and toroidal components as @xmath95 and @xmath96 , while the density at ( @xmath97 ) can be explicitly expressed in terms of the dimensionless mass - accretion rate @xmath98 ( see fkcb10a ) as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the ratio of the total mass flux rate launched in the wind to @xmath98 ( while the rest is accreted ) and @xmath101 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "note also that in our discussion on density normalization that @xmath102 always refers to the local mass flux at the innermost flow radius at @xmath103 because the wind mass flux generally has a radial dependence .",
    "one can also calculate force elements in the wind ( e.g. gas pressure force and magnetic forces ) as @xmath104 ( where  is the current density of the wind ) that can be a measure of thermal equilibrium with ambient gas .",
    "at this point we would like to discuss briefly the issue of critical points in our winds .",
    "these are discussed in bp82 , cl94 and also in @xcite .",
    "a complete description would require that these solutions pass the fast and modified fast ( i.e. the critical point in the direction perpendicular to that of the imposed symmetry ) points as described in bp82 ( and achieved in @xcite ) .",
    "however , these points lie at sufficiently high latitudes where the wind densities are very low and the gas ionization complete , so that they are effectively irrelevant to the absorption features observations . as a result , we limit our wind description to crossing the alfv@xmath5n  and the slow - magnetosonic points . while crossing all critical points is an issue of principle with steady - state winds ( e.g. bp82 and cl94 _ self - similar _ winds recollimate on the axis and even turn back )",
    ", these points are in fact crossed without much trouble in nature ; i.e. in time - dependent simulations @xcite .",
    "once the fluid has achieved escape velocity it reaches infinity ( albeit after a potential recollimation along the symmetry axis ) .    in the following calculations discussed in  3 , therefore , we chose to stop the wind solutions past the alfv@xmath5n  point arbitrarily to eliminate physically less reliable portion of it .",
    "however , since our primary goal has only been to demonstrate the model s global viability with the observed x - ray absorbers and not to construct a comprehensive model of ultra - relativistic winds / jets , this approximation is justified up to near the alfv@xmath5n  point .",
    "most notably , we find that this manipulation makes little impact on our argument of was and ufos in the context of mhd - driven outflows presented in this paper since most absorbers still lie within such an artificial cut - off .",

    ", we only consider geometrical dilution factor ( see footnote 1 ) whereas in our photoionization calculations the opacity of the wind material was included ( fkcb10a , fkcb10b ) . because these quantities span a range of several decades",
    ", it is only reasonable to present the wind structure in logarithmic coordinates .",
    "thus color - coded @xmath183 is shown in the range @xmath188 and @xmath189 . to make contact with observations we also draw the observer los of different inclinations ( diagonal gray lines corresponding to @xmath190 from top to bottom ) .",
    "one can now see that low inclination lines of sight intercept mainly high ionization and low column plasma ( the iso - density curves are more closely spaced at the lower inclination directions ) .",
    "it is also apparent that the wind is highly ionized near its innermost edge where the velocities are also higher but the column intercepted is lower .",
    "it is not clear whether these sections of the wind can be detected in actual observations . with increasing inclination the los samples lower values of @xmath8 and velocity @xmath9 and higher values of the column @xmath25 .",
    "this model therefore associates naturally the observed was with objects of sufficiently high inclination angles .",
    "the two bottom panels of figure [ fig : fig4 ] correspond to winds with @xmath107 ( models c , d ) .",
    "these panels look quite similar to those of models ( a ) and ( b ) above them .",
    "the obvious difference is the more closely spaced iso - density contours due to the steeper density profile ; as a result most of the column along a given los is concentrated near @xmath191 . for the cases of both density profiles , we see that the higher angular momenta solutions leave a large fraction of the los not intercepting any plasma , at least within the computational domain .",
    "this fact would be of interest for the statistics of absorbers .    the column of these figures along a given los , one of the fundamental observables of the agn absorption features , depends , as discussed above , on the value of ( the normalized ) mass flux and , as is apparent in figure [ fig : fig4 ] , on the winds poloidal structure",
    ". clearly models ( b ) and ( c ) require observer inclinations greater than @xmath192 to produce any significant absorption column . for model ( a ) ,",
    "a column of @xmath193 and velocity @xmath194 km / s , consistent with the observations of ufos , assuming mass flux @xmath132 , demands an inclination angle @xmath195 , based on the density function @xmath196 of fkcb10a , while the observed velocity implies @xmath197 . in model (",
    "a ) we see that in this region of parameter space , @xmath198 , consistent with the presence of an  ufo .",
    "clearly models ( b ) and ( c ) have very little column for inclinations @xmath199",
    ". these figures also allow one to estimate the the velocity of a given ion ( i.e. a given value of @xmath8 ) at a specific los and as such they are of value in setting a particular set of observations within the framework of these winds .",
    "@xmath200{f4a_4.eps } \\includegraphics[trim=2 in 0 in 0 in 0in , keepaspectratio = false , width=1.8in , angle=-0,clip = false]{schematics4.eps } \\end{array}$ ]    besides the above connection between was and ufos we would further like to point out that the highly ionized section of the wind near its axis provides thermodynamic characteristics consistent with radio jet properties . to this end , we show in figure  [ fig : fig5]a ( in linear space again ) , the innermost ( @xmath201 ) structure of model ( a ) : the contours of wind poloidal velocity @xmath202 are given by the solid curves ( for @xmath203 from innermost to outermost ) while those of the wind pressure by the dashed ones ( for @xmath204 dyne  @xmath18 from bottom to top ) and are superimposed on the color coded ionization structure @xmath205 , normalized to its maximum value .",
    "in this region , the pressure @xmath206 dyne  @xmath18 and velocity @xmath207 are consistent with those obtained for the ufos of the radio galaxy 3c  111 @xmath208 dyne  @xmath18 ( t12b ) , which were also shown to be compatible with the pressure of radio jets in the same region . because of their tighter collimation ,",
    "we would therefore associate models ( a ) and ( d ) with the structure of radio loud seyferts .",
    "finally , a choice between these two models will rely on the dependence of the value of @xmath25 on the ionization parameter @xmath8 , assuming that the entire x - ray spectrum is produced by a point - like source , i.e. a source whose extent does not depend on the x - ray energy .",
    "we have presented above the 2d ionization structure of the mhd winds which our previous works we have associated with the was of agns . we have argued further that the same winds are also compatible with the more recently discovered ufos and that in fact these features are different facets of the same underlying phenomenon , which apparently also occurs in radio galaxies , like 3c  111 .",
    "we have also argued that the radio / x - ray observations of this later object imply pressure equilibrium between its radio jet emitting plasma and the plasma associated with its ufos , suggesting that the former occupies , in pressure equilibrium , the near - axis region of the self - similar ufo - wa flows of our models .",
    "the main results of the present work are encapsulated in figures 1 and 4 : they present the extreme cases of wind collimation geometry compatible with our assumptions for two different values of the wind radial density dependence .",
    "we found that , while the density profile does affect the wind collimation , the latter is determined mainly by the value of their specific angular momentum @xmath86 , with higher values producing significantly less collimation than lower ones .",
    "the issue of jet / mhd wind collimation is of interest in studies of agn statistics , considering that the outer regions of these winds could play the role of the agn unification  torus \" @xcite .",
    "thus , higher collimation implies larger fraction of sources with x - ray absorption features . a more collimated flow , because of less ambient matter entrainment , is more likely to produce a well defined , large scale narrow jet and therefore of higher velocity .",
    "similarly , less collimated flows are likely to entrain more matter leading to lower velocity jets .",
    "the point of the present work is to note that , while it is difficult to image the regions where these flows originate and collimate , one can obtain their physical conditions ( column , velocity ) from spectroscopic x - ray observations and also its collimation properties from the statistics of agns with a given amount of obscuration @xcite and their relation to the direction of a larger scale radio jet .",
    "a resolution of these issues , as well as those of systematics such as the obscuration dependence on luminosity @xcite , require further observations and modeling @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that large scale mhd winds will form the basis for an account of such global properties . figure  [ fig : fig5]b illustrates a proposed manifestation of apparently distinct absorbers in the mhd wind discussed in this study .",
    "while it is beyond the scope of this work , we also note in a global viewpoint that the radial extent of magnetized winds is coupled to the disk magnetization @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is an issue of the radial density dependence of these winds . as we discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the main motivating factor of our previous work , have been the observations of @xcite that indicate @xmath209 where @xmath30 and imply a los density profile @xmath210 with most values closer to @xmath30 [ the parameter @xmath28 is related to that @xmath55 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : b ] ) by @xmath211 .",
    "as we noted this scaling suggests correlations between the column @xmath25 , the velocity @xmath9 and the ionization parameter @xmath8 of specific transitions at a given object ( for instance @xmath212 .",
    "more recently , observations , mainly of ufos but also certain wa transitions , in an ensemble of ( rather than a single ) agns ( @xcite ,  t12b ) , have shown on the aggregate , a preference for the value @xmath213 implying a los density profile closer to @xmath107 . at this point",
    "it would be of interest to note that models that include a combined accretion ",
    "outflow approach to the problem @xcite are more restricted in their choice of parameters than those presented above and do provide additional restrictions to the values of @xmath28 .",
    "so ,  cold \" flows @xcite are restricted to density profiles very close to @xmath107 , while models with  entropy injection \" near the alfv@xmath5n  surface @xcite can yield density profiles close to @xmath31 . at this point",
    "we will reiterate that x - ray spectroscopy observations could provide the distinction between these extreme cases thus establishing a probe of the accretion ",
    "outflow physics of these systems .",
    "another issue with the solutions we present is their reliance on self - similarity .",
    "the utility of this technique is not only mathematical , i.e. in allowing one to obtain solutions of the mhd equations ; it is of importance because it provides solutions that span a multiple decades in radius .",
    "solutions of this type are demanded by the data , i.e. the large range in ionization parameter spanned by the observed x - ray transitions , as discussed in  1 .",
    "whether the simple functional form of the model parameters given above extends over the entire domain of validity of these solutions is an issue that should be answered observationally .",
    "deviations from a single power law would indicate the presence of additional physics that will have to be included in such calculations .    by their nature , self - similar solutions can not cover the region near the flow symmetry axis and they must also terminate at some distance from the origin . as we have noted above , the near - axis high latitude region is much less dense and much more highly ionized than the lower latitude ones , so from the interpreting observed point of view of absorption features which is the main thrust of the present paper , it is not of significance .",
    "it is certainly of significance mathematically and for impacting the physics of jets , as the magnetic fields of this region are likely to thread the bh event horizon .",
    "pressure balance requires that the pressure there match that at larger radii where the self - similar solutions are valid .",
    "possibly this is the pressure of relativistic particles that give rise to the radio jets observed .",
    "such models that combine a self - similar disk - wind solution with an mhd flow of limited lateral extent ( i.e. one in which the magnetic field threads a star or a bh ) , have recently appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "again , it is very conceivable that the winds may consist of _ two _ components ; an axial collimated _ jet _ of low matter density probably originating from the bh itself surrounded by an extended _ disk - wind _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also similar to our view depicted in figure  [ fig : fig5]b .",
    "it is of interest to note that the last of the above references finds flows with opening angles between 4and 6 , not very different of those of models ( a ) and ( d ) .    at large radii",
    ", these solutions can not be trusted beyond an equatorial distance larger than that of the underlying disk .",
    "this distance is not known .",
    "however , it can not be larger than the black hole influence radius , @xmath214 , i.e. the distance at which the disk keplerian velocity matches the velocity dispersion @xmath215 of the agn surrounding spheroid . however , given the relation between @xmath216 and @xmath217 , namely ( @xmath218 @xcite , this distance is of order @xmath219 cm .",
    "it is of interest to note that absorption feature observations , in conjunction with our models , could provide an independent estimate of this distance and therefore an independent measure of the @xmath220 relation .    finally , one should bear in mind that density profiles @xmath221 , produce winds whose mass flux increases with distance for @xmath222 . applying the profile with @xmath223 and @xmath224 used in our models to an accreting bh of @xmath225 we obtain a total mass flux of @xmath226 a value much higher than that needed to power its bolometric luminosity of @xmath227 erg / s .",
    "the corresponding ( integrated ) kinetic power is given by @xmath228 .",
    "assuming @xmath229 this yields @xmath230 erg  s@xmath20 that is indeed consistent with the estimated ufo power in 3c  111 ( @xcite ,  t12b ) providing a large impact on agn feedback process at large scales .",
    "on the other hand , the cumulative power of uv / soft x - ray was may be able to reach this level as well ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that outflow rates , estimated by x - ray spectroscopy in bh binaries @xcite , were found to be much larger than the accretion rates needed to power their x - ray luminosity .    on a closing note , although in this work we primarily focused on physical conditions and a _ global _ geometrical structure of mhd winds , we are currently simulating the corresponding spectral signatures of the absorption lines within this model ( fukumura et al .",
    "2013 , in prep ) . to constrain individual wind parameters ( such as @xmath231 and their dependency on @xmath102 and @xmath157 ) , however , one may require numerical calculations of x - ray absorption feature with sets of mhd parameters and perform a @xmath26-test in comparison with data ; i.e. observationally constrain the wind parameters that would otherwise be inaccessible . while it is still challenging to constrain all the wind variables ,",
    "one can still hope to restrict the range of wind parameters allowed by spectrum analysis .",
    "the capabilities of the upcoming mission _",
    "astro - h _ should be instrumental in performing these insightful observations .",
