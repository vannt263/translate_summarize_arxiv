    "one possible implication of non - zero neutrino mass is that as neutrinos propagate , mixing occurs between mass eigenstates ( @xmath4 ) and the flavor eigenstates ( @xmath5 ) involved in the weak interactions governing neutrino production and detection .",
    "the mass and flavor eigenstates are related by a unitary matrix @xmath6 expressed in terms of three mixing angles ( @xmath7 ) and a @xmath8-violating phase @xmath9@xcite .",
    "experimental evidence points towards this occurring via disappearance of @xmath3 in solar neutrinos@xcite and @xmath10 in reactor neutrinos@xcite , as well as @xmath0 disappearance in atmospheric neutrinos produced by cosmic rays@xcite and accelerators@xcite .",
    "the goal of the ain njector eutrino scillation earch ( `` minos '' ) long - baseline experiment is to precisely measure the oscillation parameters involved in the atmospheric - sector oscillations .",
    "it does this by observing the intense and well - understood numi beam over a known baseline using with two similar magnetized steel / scintillator calorimeters : from its source at fermilab with a `` near detector '' , then again to the northwest in the soudan mine underground lab using the `` far detector '' .",
    "such a before - and - after comparison of the neutrinos greatly reduces systematic errors associated with comparing differences in the observed neutrino spectra to various neutrino oscillation scenarios , allowing for a more accurate probe of the physics of neutrino propagation .",
    "details of the detector designs , calibrations , and performance can be found in @xcite .",
    "the numi beam@xcite is generated by protons hitting a carbon target .",
    "the resulting charged pions are focused by two electromagnetic horns and sent down a decay pipe , producing a beam of 92.9%  @xmath0 , 5.8%  @xmath11 , 1.2%  @xmath3 and 0.1%  @xmath12 . changing the pion - focusing horn positions and currents creates very different neutrino spectra .",
    "the bulk of the data come from the `` low energy '' beam configuration , peaked at several gev ( see the dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : numuspectrum ] ) .",
    "short exposures in other beam configurations observed by the high - statistics near detector provide good crosschecks to the beam modeling process and also help to reduce systematic errors .",
    "this paper summarizes the results of several analyses of the neutrino data acquired over the two year time period starting with the beginning of numi operations in may of 2005 and ending during the summer shutdown in june 2007 , an integrated exposure of over @xmath13  protons on target ( `` pot '' ) with a neutrino yield on order of one neutrino per proton .",
    "the intrinsic divergence of the beam results in a neutrino flux at the far detector which is a factor of @xmath14 lower than that at the near detector .",
    "an additional is on tape , representing beam from october 2007 through june 2009 .",
    "the beam focusing was reversed to favor anti - neutrino production upon resumption of data taking in september of 2009 , and was switched back to normal neutrino mode in march 2010 after collecting .",
    "minos analyses are done `` blind '' .",
    "that is , small subsets of the data are examined immediately to develop the algorithms and cuts which extract the physics results from the data , but the bulk of the dataset is left alone till the data analysis methods have been settled on .",
    "detailed comparisons of variables used in cuts are made between simulated monte carlo data and real data , to be sure that detector quirks and parameter distributions are well modeled and understood .",
    "once the simulations and analysis techniques are close to final and uncertainties , systematic errors and expected sensitivities calculated , `` sidebands '' ( parameters similar to but not actually the ones used to produce the final answer ) are revealed and compared to expectations . only once everything is as well understood as possible is the `` box opened '' and the mature analysis unleashed on the full dataset to produce the final physics results .",
    "this process helps to ensure that the development of the analysis does nt inadvertently ( consciously or otherwise ) converge on a fluctuation in the data , skewing the final results or their significances .",
    "extensions to the analyses presented below to the newer , as yet unanalyzed data are in progress , and as new improvements are being made to the methods , the new analyses are also using this blinding procedure .",
    "minos was intended to observe charged current ( `` cc '' ) quasi - elastic @xmath0 interactions to make a precision measurement of @xmath15 .",
    "its calorimeters are designed to measure the @xmath16 produced in @xmath0 cc interactions , and are magnetized to provide momentum and charge discrimination on an event by event basis , as well as the standard calorimetric method of establishing particle energies via @xmath17 . by using far and near detectors which are as similar as possible , uncertainties in the energy scale between measurements of the neutrino spectrum before and after traveling the baseline are minimized .",
    "small differences between detectors in light collection and electronics were cross - calibrated in a beam test at cern using the `` calibration detector''@xcite which observed the same particles with both sets of electronics@xcite .",
    "since the oscillation minima at this baseline is less than the @xmath18 production threshold energy , the oscillatory signature is that of @xmath0 disappearance rather than @xmath19 appearance , an analysis described in sec .",
    "[ sec : cc ] .",
    "minos magnetic fields allow discrimination between @xmath0 and @xmath20 and provide a chance to test cpt conservation by seeing if neutrinos and anti - neutrinos have the same oscillation parameters ( sec .",
    "[ sec : numubar ] ) .",
    "although the calorimetry is coarser than one might like for such a measurement , electromagnetic showers can still be resolved .",
    "this allows further study of possible @xmath0 disappearance to sterile @xmath1 states by observation of neutral current ( `` nc '' ) interactions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : sterile ] ) , and sensitivity to sub - dominant @xmath21 transitions by looking for @xmath3 appearance oscillations ( sec.[sec : nue ] ) .      since @xmath22 and @xmath23 , when considering the atmospheric neutrino sector the full neutrino mixing matrices reduce to a simpler two - flavor equation .",
    "a @xmath0 of energy @xmath24 $ ] observed after traveling some distance @xmath25 $ ] from its production point has a probability of being detected as a @xmath0 given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 $ ] is the mass difference between @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the mixing amplitude .",
    "an exposure of in minos has been analyzed@xcite , selecting 848 far detector events as @xmath0 with good purity .",
    "the observed ( unoscillated ) near detector signal is used to calculate a null hypothesis expectation of 1065@xmath3160 far detector events , including a small background estimated to be composed of 2.3 external @xmath16 , 5.9 nc induced showers , and 1.5 @xmath18 decays .",
    "the resulting spectra is shown with the observed data in fig .",
    "[ fig : numuspectrum ] . comparing the observed data to expectations modified by eq",
    ".  [ eq:2flavor ] result in best fit oscillation parameters of @xmath32  ev@xmath33 ( 68% cl ) and @xmath34  ( 90% cl ) .",
    "systematic errors in @xmath35 are dominated by uncertainties in the hadronic energy scale ( @xmath3110.3% absolute and @xmath313.3% relative between near and far detectors ) and the relative normalization between detectors ( @xmath314% ) .",
    "the background of nc showers mis - reconstructed as @xmath0 quasi - elastic interactions ( @xmath3150% ) dominates in @xmath36 .",
    "these systematics ( in @xmath35 and @xmath37 in @xmath36 ) are still smaller than the statistical ( in @xmath35 and @xmath38 in @xmath36 ) errors , so the measurement will improve as data from the remaining @xmath39 of the minos exposure are added .",
    "the magnetized nature of the minos detectors allows the event - by - event determination of the charge sign of muons , and thus the identification of the parent neutrino or anti - neutrino undergoing the quasi - elastic interaction that produced them .",
    "selection of wrong - sign muons in the @xmath0 beam tests if @xmath20 oscillate in the same fashion as @xmath0 in eq .",
    "[ eq:2flavor ] . is @xmath40 and @xmath41 ?",
    "furthermore , could some fraction @xmath42 of disappearing @xmath0 reappear as @xmath20 ?",
    "these are both tests of cpt conservation , and with its magnetic field minos is the only experiment capable of testing this .",
    "anti - neutrinos in the numi beam come primarily from @xmath43 which travel directly down the center of the focusing horns and thus avoid being de - focused , leaving little kinematic phase space for these pions .",
    "combined with the lower cross - sections for anti - neutrinos compared to neutrinos , only 6.4% of the neutrino interactions in a far detector exposure are due to anti - neutrinos , making the relative backgrounds are higher , the statistics lower , and the spectrum harder ( fig .",
    "[ fig : numubar ] ) .",
    "42  @xmath20 events are seen while @xmath44 are expected in the no - oscillation case , or @xmath45 if cpt is conserved given the observed @xmath0 oscillation parameters@xcite .",
    "this places a 90%cl upper limit of @xmath46 , and the anti - neutrino oscillation parameters are consistent with the neutrino parameters given these low statistics , excluding at 90%cl for maximal mixing .    to increase the anti - neutrino dataset by an order of magnitude , the polarity of the focusing horns in the numi beam was reversed to focus @xmath43 rather than the usual @xmath47 for an exposure of of anti - neutrino production .",
    "the statistics available in this set of data would make a reasonable measurement of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( fig.[fig : rhc ] ) .",
    "another possible explanation of @xmath0 disappearance is oscillation into sterile neutrinos ( `` @xmath50 '' ) which experience no interactions and thus would disappear .",
    "this would also suppress the rate of nc events in the far detector compared to the traditional explanation of oscillation to sub - threshold @xmath19 , since those @xmath19 still undergo nc interactions but @xmath50 would not .    to test this hypothesis , nc",
    "showers have been selected from an exposure of @xcite .",
    "a nc interaction produces no outgoing leptons , but simply a hadronic shower .",
    "any @xmath51 produced in that shower decays rapidly to a pair of gamma rays , which produce diffuse electromagnetic showers that can be reliably separated from the long @xmath16 tracks used in sec .",
    "[ sec : cc ] .",
    "388 events are selected , 141 of them of less than , with an estimated 17 non - nc interactions ( primarily very short track @xmath0 cc interactions ) creeping in as background in this low energy region of interest for oscillation physics .",
    "the resulting spectrum of these nc events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ncspectrum ] ) is not depressed compared with the expectations of nc interactions from standard @xmath52 oscillations .",
    "the ratio of observed to expected nc events in the far detector is @xmath53 in the energy region of where @xmath0 are disappearing .",
    "while the addition of a fourth neutrino eigenstate results in several new ways things could oscillate , fits to all those models place limits on @xmath54 and @xmath55 on being half ( or less ) than @xmath56 , showing that sterile neutrinos are not a dominant player in @xmath0 disappearance .",
    "another way to state this is as a limit on the fraction of @xmath50 participation of @xmath57 at 90%cl .",
    "the chooz experiment@xcite sets an upper limit of @xmath58 on the mixing amplitude governing the transmutation of numi @xmath0 into @xmath3 .",
    "minos was designed to be a good muon calorimeter for @xmath0 disappearance , but is coarse for resolution of @xmath59gev electromagnetic showers , each + thick plane being 1.4  radiation lengths thick , and each wide scintillator strip being 1.1  molire radii . however , the experiment retains sensitivity to the @xmath592% @xmath3 appearance signal which a @xmath2 near the chooz limit@xcite would create , and the first of minos data have been examined@xcite by a neural network to select electromagnetic shower candidates , which are more compact when produced by an electron from a cc @xmath3 interaction than from a nc - induced @xmath51 . when applied to monte carlo data",
    "this is 41% efficient at keeping @xmath3 events while rejecting @xmath6092% of nc showers ( the dominant background ) and @xmath6099% of @xmath0 charged current ( `` cc '' ) interactions ( high - y collisions which put much more energy into the hadronic debris than the outgoing @xmath16 lepton ) .",
    "given the small expected signal and large uncertainties in hadronic shower modeling , data - driven methods are used to better estimate the background . at the near detector",
    "no oscillation has yet occurred , so with the exception of the well - modeled inherent beam @xmath3 , all events selected must be examples of such background events .",
    "the two classes of backgrounds have different production kinematics so extrapolate to the far detector slightly differently , thus two techniques are used to deconvolve the background .",
    "the first takes obvious @xmath0 interactions and subtracts the hits from the muon track , resulting in a sample of cc - induced showering events to study .",
    "the second compares data from beam running with the focusing horn on or off .",
    "the very different neutrino spectra which result allow fitting for the two background components .",
    "both methods give comparable results and produce the background at the far detector shown as the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : nue ] .",
    "this yields an expected background of 26.6 ( 18.2  nc , 5.1  cc , and 2.2 beam @xmath3 ) at the far detector , while 35 @xmath3 like events are seen , a excess ( including 7.3% statistical and 19% systematic errors ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nue ] ) . if fit for oscillations , this is just below the chooz limit and consistent within errors with no @xmath3 appearance .",
    "there is somewhat more than twice the exposure used for this analysis already on tape .",
    "in addition to decreasing the statistical error on the data points , the systematic error bars include a large statistical component due to the small data subsets used in the data - driven background estimation .",
    "thus , an analysis of the additional data available is expected to substantially reduce the systematic error bars as well .",
    "projections of the sensitivity of this new dataset suggest that the slight excess observed in this current analysis will either be shown to be more significant ( if it is really @xmath3 appearance ) or to be revealed as merely a background fluctuation .",
    "two other hypotheses have been presented ( and not thoroughly ruled out by previous observations ) to explain the @xmath0 disappearance outside the standard oscillations model .",
    "the first is quantum decoherence of the neutrino s wave packet@xcite , in which the survival probability equivalent to eq .",
    "[ eq:2flavor ] varies as @xmath61 $ ] ( eq .  5 of@xcite ) rather than @xmath62 .",
    "the best fit to this function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccratio ] as the dashed line , and a comparison of @xmath63 to the data and the standard @xmath52 disfavors the decoherence hypothesis at the level .",
    "the second alternate hypothesis is that neutrinos decay@xcite , producing a survival probability which varies as @xmath64 ^ 2 $ ] ( eq .",
    "13 of @xcite ) . again",
    ", this shape does not match the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccratio ] as well as standard oscillations , and is disfavored at .",
    "however , this result is for pure neutrino decay , which is also disfavored by super - k@xcite .",
    "if there were oscillations and neutrino decay happening at the same time@xcite , the waters are muddier , see eq .",
    "17 of @xcite . in order to get a better handle on this problem",
    ", minos makes use of nc events as well as the cc spectral shape@xcite , since a decayed neutrino will not produce a nc event while a @xmath19 will .",
    "doing this improves the rejection of the pure decay hypothesis to , and places a limit on the ratio of neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath65 s lifetime to mass of ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ncalpha ] ) .",
    "in addition to the numi beam , the minos far detector is bathed in the same flux of cosmic - ray induced atmospheric neutrinos which provided the first measurements of neutrino oscillations@xcite .",
    "however , minos being an order of magnitude smaller than super - kamiokande , the atmospheric neutrino interaction rate is several per week rather than dozens per day , limiting the statistical significance of such measurements .",
    "nevertheless , analyses of such neutrinos are consistent with the oscillation parameters established in the beam neutrinos@xcite and provide the first direct observations of anti - neutrinos from cosmic rays@xcite .",
    "this review is of minos neutrino oscillation results , so other work using these detectors will not be discussed in depth .",
    "however , studies using cosmic rays have grown out of the need to calibrate the minos detectors , and speak to the depth of understanding of these detectors .",
    "cosmic ray analyses include the first direct measurement of the charge ratio of cosmic ray muons at tev energies@xcite and probe the meson production in cosmic ray primary interactions by watching the variation in the underground muon rate vary with stratospheric conditions@xcite , a competition between secondary mesons decaying to produce the observed cosmic ray muon and re - interacting in the atmosphere .",
    "this effect is also of use to atmospheric physicists , who turn the problem around to use the cosmic rays to study unusual events in the stratosphere itself@xcite .",
    "studies of neutrino interactions themselves are also a large topic of work , as the near detector observes @xmath66 neutrino interactions per day of operations , by far the largest statistics sample in the world .",
    "the resulting improved knowledge of neutrino interaction physics feeds directly back to reducing the systematic errors in the oscillation analyses@xcite .",
    "looking at miniboone neutrinos in minos and vice - versa helps to understand the off - axis components of neutrino beams@xcite . using beam neutrinos in different ways",
    "has also yielded interesting results on the velocity of neutrinos ( comparing arrival times at near and far detectors)@xcite and has been used to test for violation of lorentz invariance in the neutrino sector@xcite .",
    "minos has measured neutrino oscillation parameters in the `` atmospheric '' @xmath67 sector with high precision , favoring standard @xmath52 oscillations with @xmath68  ev@xmath33 ( 68% cl ) and @xmath34  ( 90% cl ) .",
    "quantum decoherence as an explanation for the @xmath0 disappearance is disfavored at the level .",
    "measurements of the total active neutrino flux using neutral current interactions help to disfavor pure @xmath69 oscillations by , place a limit on the ratio of neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath65 s lifetime to mass of , and limit the participation of sterile neutrinos in a sub - dominant mode to a fraction @xmath57 at 90%cl .",
    "examination of the limited set of anti - neutrino data have shown no evidence for different oscillation parameters for anti - neutrinos , and limit the fraction @xmath42 of @xmath0 disappearing to @xmath20 to @xmath46 at 90%cl .",
    "these results come from an exposure of roughly 1/3 the eventual complete minos dataset , so the final precision of the measurements will be greater than those reviewed here .",
    "this is especially true in the cases of @xmath3 appearance , where the data - driven background estimations methods will benefit greatly from additional statistics , and in the measurements of @xmath20 , which will take advantage of dedicated anti - neutrino beam running .",
