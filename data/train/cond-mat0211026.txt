    "<S> we predict a dynamical classical superfluid - insulator transition in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped in a combined optical and axially - symmetric harmonic potentials initiated by a periodic modulation of the radial trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is marked by a loss of phase coherence in the bec and a subsequent destruction of the interference pattern upon free expansion . for a weak modulation of the radial potential the phase coherence </S>",
    "<S> is maintained . </S>",
    "<S> for a stronger modulation and a longer time of holding in the modulated trap , the phase coherence is destroyed signaling a classical superfluid - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> the results are illustrated by a complete numerical solution of the axially - symmetric mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation for a repulsive bec . </S>",
    "<S> suggestion for future experiment is made .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental loading of a cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in both one- @xcite and three - dimensional @xcite optical lattice potentials has allowed the study of quantum phase effects on a macroscopic scale such as interference of matter waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there have been several theoretical studies on different aspects of a bec in one- @xcite and three - dimensional @xcite optical lattice potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the phase coherence between different sites of a trapped bec on an optical lattice has been established in recent experiments @xcite through the formation of distinct interference pattern when the traps are removed . in a one - dimensional optical lattice potential </S>",
    "<S> the expanding pattern consists of a large central piece and two smaller ones moving in opposite directions on a straight line @xcite . in a two - dimensional optical lattice potential </S>",
    "<S> the pattern consists of a large central piece and eight others on the sides of an expanding square @xcite . in a three - dimensional optical lattice potential </S>",
    "<S> the pattern consists of a large central piece and twenty six others on the surface of an expanding cube @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the interference pattern is a consequence of phase coherence in the bec generated due to free quantum tunneling of atoms from one optical lattice site to another originating in the superfluid state of the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> equal phase at all points or a slowly ( and orderly ) varying phase are the ideal examples of coherent phase . on the other hand , a rapidly ( or arbitrarily ) </S>",
    "<S> varying phase in space is usually incoherent .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated for a three - dimensional optical trap potential by greiner _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite that , as the strength of the optical potential traps is increased , the quantum tunneling of condensed atoms from one optical site to another is stopped resulting in a loss of superfluidity and phase coherence in the bec . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , no interference pattern is formed upon free expansion of such a bec which is termed a mott insulator state . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon represents a superfluid to mott insulator quantum phase transition . the phase on an optical lattice site and the number of atoms in that site play the roles of conjugate variables obeying the heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics @xcite . in the superfluid state </S>",
    "<S> the coherent phase is considered to be known and consequently the number of atoms on each site is unknown thus allowing a free movement of atoms from one site to another @xcite . in the mott insulator state </S>",
    "<S> the phase is entirely arbitrary across the optical lattice sites and the number of atoms at each site is fixed and their free passage from one site to another is stopped . </S>",
    "<S> as the strength of the optical potential traps in the mott insulator state is reduced the superfluidity is restored in a short time via a mott insulator to superfluid quantum phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this reversible quantum phase transition may occur at absolute zero ( 0 k ) and is driven by heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite and not by thermal fluctuations involving energy as in a classical phase transition . as the temperature approaches absolute zero all thermal fluctuations die out and at 0 k classical phase transitions are necessarily excluded .    following a suggestion by smerzi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , cataliotti _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite have demonstrated in a novel experiment the loss of phase coherence and superfluidity in a bec trapped in a one - dimensional optical - lattice and harmonic potentials when the center of the harmonic potential is suddenly displaced along the optical lattice through a distance larger than a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> then a modulational instability takes place in the bec and it can not reorganize itself quickly enough and the phase coherence and superfluidity of the bec are lost . </S>",
    "<S> the loss of superfluidity is manifested in the destruction of the interference pattern upon free expansion . however , for displacements smaller than the critical distance the bec can reorganize itself and the superfluidity is maintained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> distinct from the quantum phase transition observed by greiner _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this modulational instability responsible for the superfluid - insulator transition is classical in nature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this process is also different from the landau dissipation mechanism @xcite , occurring when the fluid velocity is greater than local speed of sound . </S>",
    "<S> when landau instability occurs , the system lowers energy by emitting phonons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present classical dynamical transition can be well described @xcite by the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the above modulational instability is not the unique dynamical classical process leading to a superfluid - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> many other classical processes leading to a rapid movement in the condensate can lead to such a transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the movement should be rapid enough so that the bec can not reorganize itself to evolve through phase coherent states . in @xcite a rapid translation of the bec through the optical lattice sites </S>",
    "<S> leads to the destruction of phase coherence . here </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that a rapid oscillation of the bec may also lead to a superfluid - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation is initiated by a periodic modulation of the magnetic trapping potential @xmath0 in the radial direction via @xmath1 where @xmath2 is time , @xmath3 an amplitude , @xmath4 is the radial trapping frequency , and @xmath5 is the frequency of modulation </S>",
    "<S> . such modulation of the trapping potential is known to generate resonant ( collective ) excitations in the bec which have been studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in the absence of an optical lattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> the study of such excitations in the presence of an optical lattice potential has just began @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar collective excitation generated by a periodic modulation of the atomic scattering length @xcite has also been shown to lead to a classical superfluid - insulator transition @xcite .    in the quantum phase transition </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the mott insulator state has a perfectly smooth probability distribution ( modulus of the wave function ) across the optical lattice sites whereas the phase of the wave function across the optical lattice sites remains entirely arbitrary . in the dynamical classical transition considered in this work , because of classical oscillation of the bec , the insulator state in the joint traps is marked by a partially disturbed ( nonsmooth ) probability distribution across the optical lattice sites in addition to the loss of phase coherence . </S>",
    "<S> however , the information about the destruction of superfluidity in both quantum and classical cases is _ not _ solely contained in the initial probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the bec needs to be released from the joint traps and the formation of the interference pattern studied for a definite conclusion about the destruction of superfluidity .    </S>",
    "<S> as the present transition is classical or mean - field - type in nature , we base the present study on the numerical solution of the time - dependent mean - field axially - symmetric gp equation @xcite in the presence of a combined harmonic and optical potential traps . the time - dependent bec wave function @xmath6 at position @xmath7 and time @xmath8 is described by the following mean - field nonlinear gp equation @xcite @xmath9\\psi({\\bf r};t)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the mass and @xmath11 the number of atoms in the condensate , @xmath12 the strength of interatomic interaction , with @xmath13 the atomic scattering length . in the presence of the combined axially - symmetric and optical lattice traps @xmath14 where @xmath4 is the angular frequency of the harmonic trap in the radial direction @xmath15 , @xmath16 that in the axial direction @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the aspect ratio , and @xmath19 is the optical lattice trap introduced later . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization condition is @xmath20    in the axially - symmetric configuration , the wave function can be written as @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> now transforming to dimensionless variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( [ a ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath27\\varphi ( { \\hat \\rho,\\hat z};\\tau)=0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where nonlinearity @xmath28 . in terms of the one - dimensional probability @xmath29 @xmath30 , the normalization of the wave function is given by @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> the probability @xmath32 is useful in the study of the present problem under the action of the optical lattice potential , specially in the investigation of the formation and evolution of the interference pattern after the removal of the trapping potentials .    in the experiment of cataliotti </S>",
    "<S> _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with repulsive @xmath33rb atoms in the hyperfine state @xmath34 , the radial trap frequency was @xmath35 hz . the optical potential created with the standing - wave laser field of wavelength @xmath36 nm is given by @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 @xmath41 the strength . for the mass @xmath42 kg of @xmath33rb the harmonic oscillator length @xmath43 @xmath44 m and and the present dimensionless time unit @xmath45 s @xmath46 ms . in terms of the dimensionless laser wave length @xmath47 , the dimensionless standing - wave energy parameter @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> hence in dimensionless unit @xmath19 of ( [ d1 ] ) is @xmath49.\\ ] ] although we employ the dimensionless space units @xmath50 and @xmath51 and time unit @xmath52 in numerical calculation , the results are reported in actual units @xmath53 @xmath44 m , @xmath17 @xmath44 m and @xmath54 ms . in the conversion we used the parameters of the experiment of cataliotti </S>",
    "<S> _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , e.g. , @xmath55 @xmath44 m , @xmath56 @xmath44 m , and @xmath57 ms .    </S>",
    "<S> we solve ( [ d1 ] ) numerically using a split - step time - iteration method with the crank - nicholson discretization scheme described recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time iteration is started with the harmonic oscillator solution of ( [ d1 ] ) with @xmath58 : @xmath59^{1/4}$ ] @xmath60 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinearity @xmath61 and the optical lattice potential parameter @xmath40 are slowly increased by equal amounts in @xmath62 steps of time iteration until the desired value of @xmath61 and @xmath40 are attained . </S>",
    "<S> then , without changing any parameter , the solution so obtained is iterated 50 000 times so that a stable solution is obtained independent of the initial input and time and space steps .    the one - dimensional pattern of bec on the optical lattice for a specific nonlinearity and the interference pattern upon free expansion of such a bec </S>",
    "<S> have been recently studied using the numerical solution of ( [ d1 ] ) @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we study the destruction of this interference pattern after the application of a periodic modulation of the radial trapping potential in ( [ d1 ] ) via @xmath63,\\ ] ] while the axial trapping potential is left unchanged @xcite . in the present model study </S>",
    "<S> we employ nonlinearity @xmath64 , the axial trap parameter @xmath65 , and the optical lattice strength @xmath66 throughout . </S>",
    "<S> first we calculate the ground - state wave function in the combined harmonic and optical lattice potentials .    </S>",
    "<S> modulation ( [ rep ] ) of the trapping potential may lead to resonant oscillation of the bec and such resonances have been studied in the case of harmonic trap alone @xcite . for a very small @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , prominent resonances appear in the bec oscillation when the modulation frequency @xmath5 is an integral multiple @xmath67 of the harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath4 ( @xmath68 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite expected from our wisdom in linear classical physics where resonances appear when the driving frequency is a multiple of the characteristic frequency of oscillation . actually , for a finite @xmath3 , resonances appear for a band of modulation frequency @xcite ( @xmath69 ) where @xmath70 defines the spread of frequency values . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance becomes more prominent with the increase of the parameter @xmath3 or @xmath67 . at resonance </S>",
    "<S> the bec executes rapid oscillation which is responsible for the destruction of superfluidity in the bec via a classical dynamical transition provided that the time of stay of the bec in the modulated magnetic trap , called hold time , is larger than a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> a large value of @xmath3 and/or @xmath5 facilitates the dynamical classical superfluid - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this fact in the following for @xmath71 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> a careful study of the present phenomenon will aid in the understanding of resonance in nonlinear physics . </S>",
    "<S> although the generation of resonance in different linear problems is well understood , the same in nonlinear physics is just starting .     </S>",
