    "in material science , fractography is concerned with the description of fracture surfaces in solids and is routinely used to determine the cause of failure in engineering structures  @xcite .",
    "various types of crack growth ( fatigue , stress corrosion , cracking ... ) produce different characteristic features on the surface , which in turn can be used to identify the failure mode and direction .",
    "fractography is one of the most used experimental techniques to recover some aspects of crack dynamics , and is thus a major tool to develop and evaluate theoretical models of crack growth behavior .",
    "fractography in two dimensional and three dimensional materials is fundamentally different .",
    "a broken surface in three dimensions is the trace of a front line singularity and unless a full dynamical measurement is available , it is not possible to reconstruct its propagation history  @xcite .",
    "an extreme example is the family of systems in which a crack front is confined to move along a weak plane  @xcite and where the post - mortem surface is simply a flat surface that can not reveal any information on the actual advance of the crack front .",
    "in contrast , a crack path in two dimensions is simply the trace left by the propagation of a crack tip and thus can be thought of as the world - line of a moving singularity .",
    "this means that a post - mortem fractographic analysis can fully recover the crack propagation history .",
    "this shows that the 2d problem provides a good framework with many advantages to decipher the crack tip dynamics , and is therefore our focus here .    for slowly propagating cracks in homogeneous materials ,",
    "fracture surfaces are smooth and a fundamental question that arises in that context is the stability of the propagating crack with respect to a prescribed path .",
    "a stability analysis of two - dimensional cracks propagating in homogeneous materials based on linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) was performed by cotterell and rice  @xcite , and yields the famous @xmath0-criterion .",
    "this criterion states that if the quantity called the @xmath0-stress ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sif ] ) below for a definition ) is positive the crack path becomes unstable , whereas if @xmath1 the path is stable .",
    "experimentally and theoretically , the instability predicted by the @xmath0-criterion has been proven to be a necessary condition but not a sufficient one  @xcite .",
    "the stability analysis of cotterell and rice being incomplete already in homogeneous media can not be expected to describe correctly crack propagation in heterogeneous media where the path of the fracture is generally rough .",
    "actually , for such materials , fracture surfaces are claimed to exhibit fractal ( or self - affine ) properties  @xcite .",
    "the self - affinity of a @xmath2-dimensional surface is fully characterized by @xmath3 exponents  @xcite . since the dynamics of cracks in heterogeneous media is a rich field encompassing a wide range of physical phenomena , it is important to distinguish between three different exponents  : the one describing roughness in the direction perpendicular to the crack propagation  @xcite , the second one describing the roughness in the direction of the propagation ( the so called `` out - of - the - plane '' roughness , which is the subject of this paper ) and the third one describing the in - plane roughness of the crack front during its propagation through the material  @xcite . in some cases",
    "these exponents are related @xcite but generically they are independent",
    ".    there are some experimental measurements of the roughness exponent @xmath4 of two - dimensional or quasi two - dimensional cracks ( in the appendix some methods of measurements of the `` out - of - the - plane '' roughness exponent are described ) . for berea sandstone ( @xmath5  @xcite ) ; for concrete ( @xmath6  @xcite ) ; for paper ( @xmath7  @xcite , @xmath8  @xcite and @xmath9  @xcite ) ; for wood ( @xmath10  @xcite ) and for a system of drinking straws ( @xmath11  @xcite ) .",
    "as can be seen , all the values vary between @xmath12 and @xmath13 and thus suggest non - universal behaviour .",
    "in particular note that the measured exponents are all larger than @xmath14 , a value that corresponds to the roughness exponent of an uncorrelated random walk  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we aim at a thorough study of crack propagation in 2d disordered materials .",
    "a natural question is whether the roughness of the broken surface is related to an instability mechanism of the crack tip propagation . in the following",
    "we will derive an equation of motion for a crack propagating in disordered medium that would allow us to study both its stability and roughness properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start by recalling the stability analysis  la cotterell and rice",
    ". then we present the formulation of a stochastic model that takes into account the material heterogeneity and uses results regarding kinked cracks , and extend the @xmath0-criterion to heterogeneous materials .",
    "we then specialize to the case @xmath15 and discuss the roughness of the resulting crack surfaces .",
    "thanks to an exact result of the model in that limit  @xcite , we are able to obtain analytically the form of the power spectrum of the paths , and offer an alternative interpretation of experimental results .",
    "we conclude by discussing the implication of our result on the methodology of self - similarity analysis by suggesting a new measurement bias that has not been considered previously  @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient that allows a general discussion of cracks in a brittle material is the fact that the static stress field in the vicinity of the crack tip has the following universal expansion @xmath16 where @xmath17 are polar coordinates with @xmath18 located at the crack tip , and @xmath19 are known functions describing the angular variations of the stress field components  @xcite . in this expansion ,",
    "@xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath0 are the stress intensity factors ( sifs ) and the nonsingular @xmath0-stress respectively .",
    "this singular behaviour of the stress field justifies the expectation that the crack - tip dynamics could be formulated in terms of the sifs and the @xmath0-stress alone .    in a 2d material ,",
    "well - established criteria for quasi - static crack propagation are the griffith energy criterion  @xcite and the principle of local symmetry ( pls ) @xcite .",
    "this is expressed by the following equations of motion @xmath22 \\ ; , \\label{eq : grif}\\\\ k_2 & = & 0 \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad [ { \\rm pls } ] \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : pls}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the lam shear coefficient and @xmath24 is the fracture energy .",
    "( [ eq : grif ] ) states that in order to induce crack propagation , the energy release rate @xmath25 must be large enough to create new crack surfaces .",
    "( [ eq : pls ] ) imposes the symmetry of the stress field in the vicinity of the crack tip , such that it is locally under a pure opening mode .",
    "therefore , the crack path is mainly selected by the pls while eq .",
    "( [ eq : grif ] ) controls the intensity of the loading necessary to allow propagation .",
    "other propagation criteria have been proposed in the literature  @xcite , notably the maximum energy release rate criterion  @xcite which states that the crack extends in the direction that maximizes the rate of energy release .",
    "however , the pls has been shown to be the only self - consistent one @xcite .",
    "a linear stability analysis of quasi - static two - dimensional crack propagation in homogeneous materials based on these concepts has been performed by cotterell and rice @xcite , which gave rise to the @xmath0-criterion .",
    "this criterion states that for @xmath26 , a tensile crack propagation becomes unstable with respect to small perturbations around the straight path .",
    "otherwise the straight crack propagation is stable .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath0-criterion is known to hold , at least for cases with @xmath27 , that is when the prediction is that cracks become unstable  @xcite . however",
    ", even when @xmath1 the crack path can become unstable in some situations ( for example , the thermal crack problem in which the crack path exhibits an oscillatory instability  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0-criterion , cotterell and rice predicted that for a semi - infinite straight crack experiencing a sudden local shear perturbation the subsequent crack path @xmath28 scales as @xmath29 in the stable regime , while @xmath30 in the unstable case .",
    "however , the result @xmath31 is only marginally stable ( i.e. @xmath32 for large @xmath33 s )  @xcite , thus reflecting a limited aspect of stability .",
    "this situation calls for a revision of the stability properties of slow cracks , especially in heterogeneous materials .",
    "based on these observations we propose an equation describing the propagation of a crack in a disordered medium that allows to predict its path and study its stability . our model is based on a description where all the relevant information is encoded in the sif s @xmath34 and in the @xmath0-stress .",
    "the crack propagation criteria used are the griffith energy balance ( [ eq : grif ] ) and the principle of local symmetry ( [ eq : pls ] ) . the physical picture of a propagating crack in a disordered material in the current formulation",
    "is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : curved ] .",
    "it assumes that the crack tip propagates smoothly until it encounters a heterogeneity that changes locally the fracture energy and induces a local shear perturbation . as a result",
    ", the crack forms a kink at a prescribed angle depending on the local perturbation induced by the heterogeneity . in order to calculate this angle",
    "it is necessary first to introduce some results regarding kinked cracks",

    "it is shown that the shape of the local crack extension should be given by  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the slope of the kink and the curvature parameter @xmath41 quantifies the curved extension of the kink .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the static sifs at the crack tip after kinking @xmath42 @xmath43 are related to the sifs before kinking @xmath20 and to the @xmath0-stress via  @xcite @xmath44\\sqrt{s}+o(s)\\ ; , \\label{eq : exp}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are universal functions in the sense that they do not depend on the geometry of the body nor on the applied loading .",
    "they depend only on the kink angle @xmath38 and were computed in  @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) shows that in general @xmath48 unless a special symmetry sets it to zero .",
    "therefore , applying the principle of local symmetry means that the expansion  ( [ eq : exp ] ) should vanish order by order in @xmath37 . in the presence of a small shear loading ( @xmath49 ) the extension of the initial straight crack",
    "must therefore satisfy @xmath50 where the expansions of the functions @xmath45 , @xmath51 and @xmath47 for small angles have been used @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : kink0 ] ) fixes the kink angle that develops due to the presence of shear perturbations , while eq .",
    "( [ eq : kink1 ] ) determines the subsequent curvature of the crack path .    in order to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : kink0 ] ) , one needs to know the sifs @xmath52 just before kinking for an arbitrary broken surface @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 ) . for pure opening loading conditions and using a perturbation analysis around a straight crack ( i.e. a crack parallel to the @xmath33-axis whose",
    "tip coincides with the curved crack located at @xmath55 ) , it can be shown that to first order in @xmath56 one can write @xmath57 and @xmath58 as functionals of @xmath28 through  @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the stress intensity factors and the @xmath0-stress component of a straight crack located at @xmath55 .",
    "also , under pure tensile loading one readily has  @xcite @xmath62 note that @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath64 , as expected , but also depends on the geometry of the problem via @xmath28 .",
    "the superscript @xmath65 refers to quantities corresponding to the configuration of a centered straight crack ( i.e. one that is located at @xmath66 ) .",
    "in addition , we will assume , as in  @xcite , that @xmath67 is independent of @xmath33 , arguing that its variation in space does not modify qualitatively the results .",
    "however , a variation in the stress intensity factor @xmath68 should induce a variation in the @xmath0-stress . indeed , lefm insures that for the same conditions under which eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) is valid , one has @xmath69 .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2star ] ) reveals an additional source of bias in the stability analysis of cotterell and rice , since the linear perturbation performed in  @xcite ignores the term proportional to @xmath28 in the expression of @xmath70 .    at this point",
    "we introduce the heterogeneities in our model .",
    "the source of heterogeneities can be either variations of the elastic moduli in the material , or from residual stresses that were introduced for example by welding  @xcite , or during the machining of the material .",
    "since the stress field is tensorial , these heterogeneities should affect both @xmath71 and @xmath70 independently .",
    "the local fluctuations in the toughness denoted by @xmath72 have a finite mean @xmath73 .",
    "however , the local shear fluctuations , denoted by @xmath74 must have a vanishing average because of pls .",
    "assuming that the crack advance between heterogeneities obeys the principle of local symmetry and using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kink0],[eq : k2],[eq : k2star ] ) and the discussion above , one concludes that the local kinking angle is determined by @xmath75 + o\\left ( \\delta k_\\ell^2 , \\delta k_\\ell^2 \\right ) \\label{eq : dtheta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is a length - scale that depends on the geometry of the configuration .",
    "for example , it is proportional to the width of the strip in the case of a finite strip geometry - a configuration that is often adopted in experiments .",
    "the stage is set now to write the equation governing the crack path evolution .",
    "since we are dealing with linear perturbations , we will also neglect the curvature parameter @xmath41 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : shape ] ) , and assume that the crack extension after kinking is always straight .",
    "this assumption is justified when @xmath15 or when the distances between successive kinking events are small ( which is equivalent to high density of heterogeneities ) .",

    "@xmath78 between successive heterogeneities , one has @xmath79 , then @xmath80 and eq .  ( [ eq : dtheta ] ) leads to @xmath81 where the indexes @xmath82 have been replaced by the position @xmath33 through the passage to the continuum limit .",

    "the discontinuous nature of crack propagation in a disordered material imposes a detailed discrete microscopic description of the influence of heterogeneities .",
    "the resulting stochastic integro - differential equation of the crack path should be derived as the continuum limit of the discrete model .",

    "will be presented in arbitrary units .",
    "regarding the @xmath0-stress , one expects @xmath93 to be of order @xmath94 in the framework of lefm .",
    "as a first observation , if the material is homogeneous or weakly disordered , one has @xmath95 and the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : start ] ) is simply @xmath96 .",
    "the addition of suitable initial conditions allows recovering the zero order solution @xmath97 corresponding to a centered straight crack path . eq .  ( [ eq : start ] ) should be understood as resulting from a perturbation analysis of the crack trajectory around the solution in the absence of heterogeneities that is selected by the pls .",
    "this should be contrasted with the stability analysis of a straight crack in a homogeneous material with respect to other solutions that satisfy also the pls .",
    "an example of such a situation is the thermal crack problem  @xcite where oscillatory crack paths exist in addition to the centered straight one and become more stable than the straight configuration at a given well defined threshold .",

    "we first consider the case with only one shear perturbation at @xmath113 , after which the local toughness is @xmath114 and only @xmath115 is allowed to fluctuate .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",

    "one noticeable difference is that for positive values of @xmath0 , the divergence of the path seems to accelerate due to the presence of the shear perturbations .",
    "still , paths that do not experience shear perturbations ( @xmath1 and @xmath118 ) will not destabilize in their presence .",
    "it should be mentioned that within the approach of cotterell & rice it is not possible to follow more than one kink , as would certainly be the case in a disordered material where cracks propagate via many consecutive kinking events .    in summary ,",
    "our results confirm the @xmath0-criterion for homogeneous materials and extends it to disordered systems .",
    "it is shown that straight crack propagation is unstable for @xmath27 and stable elsewhere .",

    "essentially , our analysis is divided into two parts .",
    "the idea is to identify first the possible responses of the crack path to one shear perturbation , and only then to generalize to a superposition of many shear perturbations .",

    "this possibility is of course excluded when looking at the power spectrum where we have clear predictions for the its form .",
    "finally , let us discuss the approach of examining self - affinity through an analysis of the whole pdf of height differences @xmath221 . in principle , this method allows to check in a very precise way the self - affinity of crack paths and yields the roughness exponent . however , this method is not easy to implement since it needs a large amount of data that is typically much more than the amount of data that a usual experiment can yield . in our simulations",
    "we could use relatively long cracks of @xmath187 pixels with a reasonable effort .",
    "even with this large amount of raw data it was not easy to get rid of artifacts in the pdf such as over estimates of the roughness exponent and detection of deviations from gaussianity , while the power spectrum could perform better already with smaller samples .",

    "the last point is not only relevant to the analysis of cracks , but applies to analysis of self - affine shapes where an oscillating background is likely to exist .",
    "we hope that this will contribute to the general discussion of reliability of self - affine measurements .    from an experimental point of view , it could be interesting to use expressions like eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h2-cps ] ) and ( [ eq : h3-cps ] ) to fit the experimental data of 2d rough cracks . an important prediction implied by these expressions",
    "is that the scale at which the crossover to a flat shape occurs is roughly @xmath223 , that is a geometric mean of a geometric length - scale and a disorder length - scale ( which is the density of disorder @xmath224 times the amplitude of the toughness fluctuations @xmath91 ) .",
    "this suggests that by varying the width of the strip in which the crack propagates and/or tuning the density and amplitude of the heterogeneities one can change the crossover scale .",

    "this property can be easily observed as a peak appearing in the power spectrum , as the transition to an oscillatory response occurs .",
    "it could be the case that some generalization of this effect is responsible to the transition reported in  @xcite from oscillatory to rough cracks .",
    "it could be that an extension of the approach developed here , together with the recent results of @xcite to account for thermal effects , provide a proper explanation for this transition .",
    "an open question , not developed in this work , is how does the material micro - structure affect the roughness of the cracks paths . here",

    "it is clear that considering off - lattice heterogeneities and taking into account the different correlation properties of @xmath115 and @xmath200 would make the paths and their resulting power spectra more complex - a well known phenomenon in stochastic systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , long - range power law correlations that are known to exist in certain materials such as quasi - crystals @xcite , porous materials @xcite and others  @xcite could yield long range correlations in the toughness / shear fluctuations , and thus lead to yet richer phenomena . actually , a recent discrete numerical model of fracture has shown that long - range correlations in the disorder and its anisotropy can lead to non - universal scaling exponents  @xcite .",
    "these results may change dramatically future approaches to problems of crack propagation in disordered materials .",

    "an important remark is that the master curve for the pdf @xmath236 does not have to be gaussian ( although it can be ) in order to imply self - affinity , it just has to be the same across all the different scales @xmath182 .",
    "although this is a very rigorous and precise method that allows both testing for self - affinity and determining the roughness exponent , it is not always possible to implement it in experimental systems as it requires precise data that spans many orders of magnitude .",
