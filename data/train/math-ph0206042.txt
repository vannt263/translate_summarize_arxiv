    "in their recent studies dorey , dunning and tateo ( ddt ) [ 1 ] have considered the manifestly non - hermitian schrdinger equation , in @xmath4 units , @xmath5 \\,{\\large \\psi }",
    "_ { k,\\ell } ( r)=e_{k,\\ell } { \\large \\psi } % _ { k,\\ell } ( x).\\ ] ] they have rigorously proved that the spectrum @xmath6 is real and discrete in the domain of the sufficiently large angular momenta , @xmath7 \\equiv \\ell _ { ddt}(\\alpha ) .\\ ] ] this inspired our subsequent study of this model [ 2 ] where we have shown that in the strong coupling regime with @xmath8 , the low lying ddt bound states may be very well approximated by the harmonic oscillators . at the same time",
    "we have noticed that the quality of such an asymptotic approximation may deteriorate quite significantly with both the increase of excitation @xmath9 and/or with the decrease of @xmath10 .",
    "such a situation is , obviously , challenging .",
    "firstly , our study [ 2 ] revealed that the manifest non - hermiticity of the models of the type ( 1 ) leads to the reliable leading order approximation _ only after _ we select our harmonic oscillator approximant as lying _ very far _ from the real axis ( i.e. , from the hermitian regime ) .",
    "such a recipe is , apparently , deeply incompatible with a smooth modification of the traditional zero - order approximants occurring in current hermitian @xmath11 recipes ( cf . a small sample of some references in [ 3 ] ) . at the same time",
    ", the smallness of @xmath12 still supports the feeling that the similar perturbation techniques _ should _ prove efficient after their appropriate modification .",
    "this observation offered a sufficiently strong motivation for our continued interest in the complex , non - hermitian model ( 1 ) which may be understood as a characteristic representative of a very broad class of the so called pseudo - hermitian models with real spectra , the analyses of which became very popular in the recent literature [ 4 ] - [ 18 ] . within this class , the strong - coupling version of ddt oscillators ( 1 ) with @xmath13 forms a particularly suitable testing ground as it combines the necessary reality of its spectrum with the smallness of the inverse quantity @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the phenomenologically appealing non - hermitian models like ( 1 ) are rarely solvable in closed form so that the presence of a  universal \" small parameter @xmath15 offers one of not too many ways towards their systematic approximate solution .    in our present paper",
    "ii we intend to discuss such a possibility in more detail .",
    "the first stages of interest in the non - hermitian oscillators ( 1 ) date back to an old paper by caliceti et al [ 5 ] .",
    "it studied the imaginary cubic problem in the context of perturbation theory and , more than twenty years ago , it offered the first rigorous explanation why the spectrum in such a model may be real and discrete . in the literature , this result has been quoted as a mathematical curiosity [ 6 ] and only many years later , its possible relevance in physics re - emerged and has been emphasized [ 7 ] .",
    "this initiated an extensive discussion which resulted in the proposal of the so called @xmath16 symmetric quantum mechanics by bender et al [ 8 ] .",
    "the key idea of the new formalism lies in the empirical observation that the ( phenomenologically desirable ) existence of the real spectrum need not necessarily be attributed to the hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
    "the current hermiticity assumption @xmath17 is replaced by the mere @xmath16 symmetry @xmath18 . here",
    ", @xmath19 denotes the parity ( @xmath20 ) while the anti - linear operator @xmath21 mimics the time reflection ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that example ( 1 ) exhibits such a type of symmetry [ 2 ] and may serve as an elementary illustration of the latter extension of quantum mechanics .    the bender s and boettcher s conjecture that @xmath23 may imply @xmath24 is fragile .",
    "the extent as well as limitations of its validity are most easily analyzed in the language of linear algebra using the biorthogonal bases [ 4,9 ] and/or exactly solvable hamiltonians [ 10 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the relevance of many unsolvable oscillators originates from their applicability in physics [ 11 ] and field theory [ 12 ] .",
    "in such a setting it is necessary to develop and test also some efficient approximation methods .",
    "new and intensive studies employed the ideas of the strong - coupling expansions [ 13 ] as well as the complex version of wkb [ 14 ] , hill determinants and fourier transformation [ 15 ] , functional analysis [ 16 ] , variational and truncation techniques [ 17 ] , and linear programming [ 18 ] .    in what follows we intend to use the method based on the smallness of the inverse angular momentum parameter @xmath14 .",
    "various versions [ 19 ] of such an approach are available for hermitian models where the combination of the central repulsive core @xmath25 with a confining ( i.e. , asymptotically growing ) interaction @xmath26 forms a practical effective potential @xmath27 which possesses a pronounced minimum .",
    "near such a minimum the shape of the potential is naturally fitted by the elementary and solvable harmonic oscillator well .",
    "corrections can be then evaluated in an unambiguous and systematic manner  [ 20 ] .    as long as we intend to move to the complex plane",
    ", the leading - order approximation may become non - unique .",
    "one finds several different complex and/or real minima of @xmath27 even in our oversimplified examples ( 1 ) [ 2 ] .",
    "for all the similar non - hermitian hamiltonians , even the most sophisticated forms of the perturbation expansions in the powers of our small parameter @xmath11 lose their intuitive background and deserve careful new tests , therefore .",
    "some of the related reopened questions will be clarified by our forthcoming considerations inspired , basically , by the pseudo - perturbative shifted@xmath28 expansion technique ( pslet ) in its form designed for the standard hermitian hamiltonians and described , say , by mustafa and odeh in ref .",
    "[ 20 ] . in this recipe ,",
    "the shifts of @xmath10 were admitted as suitable optional auxiliary parameters while the use of the prefix ",
    "pseudo- \" just indicated that @xmath10 itself is an artificial , kinematical parameter rather than a genuine dynamical coupling .",
    "as we already mentioned , one of the first @xmath29symmetric models with an immediate impact on physics has been the buslaev s and grecchi s quartic anharmonic oscillator [ 7 ] described by the radial schrdinger equation in @xmath30dimensional space ,    @xmath31 \\chi _ { k,\\ell } ( r)=e_{k,\\ell } ~\\chi _ { k,\\ell } ( r).\\ ] ]    in this model they shifted the coordinate axis to the complex plane , @xmath32 with a constant @xmath33 and variable @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "they also required that @xmath36 at all the partial waves @xmath37 and dimensions @xmath38 .",
    "this example may find the various sophisticated generalizations some of which will be also mentioned in due course in what follows .",
    "for example , a @xmath39dependent shift @xmath40 may be needed both for the exactly solvable coulombic model of ref.[21 ] and for all the more general and purely numerically tractable potentials @xmath41of ref.[8 ] with the positive exponents @xmath42 .",
    "fortunately , the transition to @xmath40 remains particularly elementary , being mediated by the mere change of the variable in eq.(3 ) within this class ( c.f . ,",
    "e.g. , ref.[21 ] for an explicit illustration ) .",
    "another remark might concern the assumption that the wave functions are square integrable .",
    "for the most elementary @xmath29 symmetric hamiltonians this assumption seems very natural but in certain more sophisticated models its use may require a more careful analysis as presented , e.g. in refs .",
    "[ 4 ] and [ 16 ] .",
    "the practical experience with the hermitian version of the pseudo - perturbation shifted - @xmath0 expansion technique of mustafa and odeh [ 20 ] may serve as a key inspiration of an appropriate complexified new pslet recipe .",
    "firstly we notice a formal equivalence between the assumed smallness of our parameter @xmath43 and of its ( arbitrarily ) shifted form .",
    "thus we introduce a new symbol @xmath44 and , simultaneously , move and rescale our coordinates @xmath45 to @xmath46 here @xmath47 is an arbitrary point , with its particular value to be determined later .",

    "such a prediction should not mislead us in connection with the related convergence / divergence of our energy series ( 8) , which is in fact the genuine test of our present  @xmath29symmetric pslet formulae .",

    "they are in almost exact accord . hereby , we may emphasize that the digital - precision enhances for larger @xmath59 ( smaller @xmath197 ) values , where the energy series ( 8) and the related pad approximants stabilize more rapidly .",
    "extending the recipe of our test beyond the weak - coupling regime @xmath198 ( i.e. @xmath199 ) we show , in table iii , the energy dependence on the non - vanishing @xmath200 evidently , the digital - precision of our  @xmath16 - pslet recipe reappears to be @xmath201-dependent and almost @xmath158 - independent . in table",

    "we have started from the observation that the physical consistency of the model ( 1 ) ( i.e. , the reality of its spectrum ) is characterized by the presence of a strongly repulsive / attractive core in the potential @xmath27 .",
