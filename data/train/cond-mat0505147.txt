    "since their discovery in 1991  @xcite , carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have attracted considerable interest worldwide because of their unusual properties and great potentials for technological applications .",
    "for example , because of their one - dimensional character , metallic cnts are quantum wires that may exhibit exotic luttinger - liquid behavior rather than usual fermi - liquid behavior in normal metal wires .  @xcite it was also predicted that nanotori formed from metallic cnts may exhibit giant paramagnetic moments .",
    "@xcite furthermore , chiral cnts are expected to exhibit a number of unusual optical properties such as optical activity , circular dichroism and second harmonic generation ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    soon after the discovery of cnts it became obvious that similar nanostructures could be formed by other elements and compounds which form layered structures bearing some resemblance to graphite .",
    "for example , hexagonal bn ( @xmath4-bn ) was predicted on the basis of theoretical calculations  @xcite to be capable of forming nanotubes , a prediction which was later confirmed experimentally by the synthesis of such nanotubes .",
    "@xcite both single - walled and multiwalled bn nanotubes ( bn - nt ) can now be readily synthesized .",
    "@xcite though cnts continue to attract great interest , other nanotubes such as bn - nts are interesting in their own right and may be able to offer different possibilities for technological applications that cnts can not provide . in particular , as far as the optical and opto - electronic applications of nanotubes are concerned , bn - nt could be superior to cnts because bn - nts are uniformly insulating , independent of their chirality .",
    "furthermore , bn - nts tend to have a zigzag structure .",
    "@xcite though it is interesting that , depending on their chirality , cnts can be metallic or semiconducting or insulating  @xcite , it is still impossible to grow cnts with a pre - specified chirality at present .",
    "finally , recent experiments indicate that bn - nts exhibit stronger resistance to oxidation at high temperatures than cnts  @xcite    therefore , the electronic , optical and other properties of both single - walled and multiwalled bn - nts are interesting and have been intensively studied theoretically in recent years ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the transverse dielectric function of bundles of single - walled bn - nts using a tight - binding model .",
    "ng and zhang  @xcite calculated the optical absorption spectra of single - walled bn - nts within a time - dependent localized - density - matrix approach based on a semiempirical hamiltonian . despite of these intensive theoretical studies , only few _ ab initio _ calculations of the optical properties of bn - nts have been reported  @xcite because of the heavy demand of the computing resources .",
    "semiempirical tight - binding model is known to describe well only the electronic excitations near the band gap of the large radius bn - nts .",
    "systematic _ ab initio _ calculations of the optical properties are thus needed in order to quantitatively interpret the optical experiments and to predict the bn - nts with desired optical properties .",
    "therefore , we have recently carried out a series of _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite in order to analysize the band structure and linear optical features of all the three types of the bn - nts and their possible dependence on diameter and chirality . in this work",
    ", we investigate the second - order optical susceptibility and also linear electro - optical coefficient of the bn - nts .",
    "the primary objective is to find out the features and magnitude of the second - harmonic generation and linear electro - optical coefficients of the bn - nts in order to see whether they have any potential applications in nonlinear optical and electro - optical devices such as second - harmonic generation , sum - frequency generation and electrical optical switch .",
    "the second objective is to identify characteristic differences in nonlinear optical properties between bn - nts and cnts .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the theoretical approach and computational details are briefly described . in sec .",
    "iii , the calculated second - order nonlinear optical susceptibility and linear electro - optical coefficients of @xmath4-bn , single hexagonal bn sheet , and bn nanotubes are presented and analysized . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , a summary is given .",
    "bn - nts can be considered as a layer of graphitic bn sheet rolled up into a cylinder , and the structure of a bn - nt is completely specified by the chiral vector which is given in term of a pair of integers ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) .",
    "@xcite as for cnts , bn - nts are classified into three types , namely , armchair ( @xmath5,@xmath5 ) nanotubes , zigzag ( @xmath5,0 ) nanotubes , and chiral ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) nanotubes with @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite we consider a large number of representative bn - nts with a range of diameters from all three types , namely , the zigzag [ ( @xmath5,0 ) , @xmath5 = 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 20 , 21 , 24 , 25 , 27 ] , armchair [ ( @xmath5,@xmath5 ) , @xmath5 = 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 15 ] , and chiral ( 4,2 ) , ( 6,4 ) , ( 8,4 ) , ( 10,5 ) bn - nts . the double - walled zigzag ( 12,0)@(20,0 ) bn nanotube and the single - walled zigzag ( 12,0 ) bn - nt bundle have also been investigated to see the effects of interwall interaction .",
    "our _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for the bn - nts were performed using highly accurate full - potential projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method  @xcite , as implemented in the vasp package  @xcite .",
    "they are based on density functional theory ( dft ) with the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "a supercell geometry was adopted so that the nanotubes are aligned in a square array with the closest distance between adjacent nanotubes being at least 6  . a large plane - wave cut - off of 450 ev was used throughout .",
    "firstly , the ideal nanotubes were constructed by rolling - up a hexagonal bn sheet .",
    "their atomic positions and lattice constants were then fully relaxed by a conjugate gradient technique .",
    "theoretical equilibrium nanotube structures were obtained when the forces acting on all the atoms and the uniaxial stress were less than 0.03 ev / @xmath8 and 2.0 kbar , respectively .",
    "the theoretical equilibrium lattice constants @xmath9 and curvature energies @xmath10 ( total energy relative to that of single bn sheet ) as well as the computational details have been reported before  @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent electronic band structure calculations were then carried out for the theoretically determined bn - nt structures . in this work ,",
    "the non - linear optical properties were calculated based on the independent - particle approximation , i.e. , the excitonic effects and the local - field corrections were neglected . as reported before  @xcite ,",
    "the dielectric function of @xmath4-bn calculated within the single - electron picture are in reasonably good agreement with experiments .",
    "therefore , it might be expected that the independent - particle approximation could work rather well for the non - linear optical properties of the bn - nts too . following previous nonlinear optical calculations  @xcite ,",
    "the imaginary part of the second - order optical susceptibility due to direction interband transitons is given by  @xcite @xmath11 where the contribution due to the so - called virtual - electron ( ve ) process is @xmath12}{\\epsilon^3_{li}(\\epsilon_{li}+   \\epsilon_{ji})}\\delta(\\epsilon_{li}-\\omega ) \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the dipole transition matrix elements @xmath16 were obtained from the self - consistent band structures within the paw formalism  @xcite .",

    "@xcite .    in the present calculations , the @xmath29-function in equs .",
    "2 - 3 is approximated by a gaussian function with @xmath30 ev .",
    "the same @xmath31-point grid as in the dos calculation is used .",
    "furthermore , to ensure that @xmath32 calculated via kramer - kronig transformation ( equ .",
    "4 ) is reliable , at least ten energy bands per atom are included in the present optical calculations .",
    "the unit cell volume @xmath33 in equs .",
    "2 - 3 is not well defined for nanotubes .",
    "therefore , like the previous calculations  @xcite , we used the effective unit cell volume of the nanotubes rather than the volume of the supercells which is arbitrary .",
    "the effective unit cell of a nanotube is given by @xmath34 t = \\pi ddt$ ] where @xmath35 is the thickness of the nanotube cylinder which is set to the interlayer distance of @xmath4-bn ( 3.28   @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath9 are the diameter and length of translational vector of the nanotube  @xcite , respectively .",
    "for comparison with the bn - nts , we first investigated the second - order nonlinear optical susceptibility of both @xmath4-bn and an isolated honeycomb bn sheet .",
    "the isolated bn sheet is simulated by a slab - supercell approach with an inter - sheet distance of 6.5  .",
    "the theoretically determined lattice constants ( @xmath37 @xmath8 and @xmath38 @xmath8 for @xmath4-bn and @xmath39 @xmath8 for the bn sheet )  @xcite were used . note that the theoretical lattice constants of @xmath4-bn agree rather well ( within 1.5 % ) with the experimental values ( @xmath40 @xmath8 and @xmath41  )  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find numerically that although @xmath4-bn has zero second - order nonlinear optical susceptibility , the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the isolated bn sheet are nonzero . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath45 denote the two cartesian coordinates within the bn layer .",
    "moreoever , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this is consistent with the symmetry consideration , demonstrating that our numerical method and calculations are qualitatively correct .",
    "bulk @xmath4-bn should have zero second - order nonlinear optical susceptibility due to its spatial inversion symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the isolated bn sheet does not have the spatial inversion symmetry ( @xmath48 ) and its symmetry class is @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "therefore , the isolated bn sheet has nonzero @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 from the symmetry consideration .  @xcite     ( a ) real and imaginary parts as well as ( b ) the absolute value of the imaginary part of @xmath51 of the isolated bn sheet . in ( c ) , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( imaginary part of the dielectric function ) from ref .",

    "it is clear from fig .",
    "1 that the second harmonic generation ( shg ) coefficient @xmath51 is significant in the entire range of the optical photon energy ( @xmath26 ) . furthermore",
    ", for the photon energy smaller than 2.2 ev , the @xmath42 is purely dispersive ( i.e. , real and lossless ) ( fig .",
    "1a ) , suggesting that the bn sheet has potential application in nonlinear optical devices .",
    "note that since the bn sheet has a theoretical band gap ( @xmath55 ) of @xmath564.5 ev , the absorptive ( imaginary ) part of the @xmath42 becomes nonzero only above the half of the band gap ( i.e. , @xmath562.2 ev ) . the real part of the @xmath42 remains nearly constant at low photon energies up to 1.0 ev , then increases steadily in magnitude as the photon energy increases , and finally peaks at the absorption edge of @xmath562.2 ev ( fig .",
    "1a ) . in the energy range from 2.5 to 5.5 ev ,",
    "the real part of the @xmath42 becomes positive and forms a broad double peak structure . beyond 5.5 ev ,",
    "it becomes negative again and its magnitude gradually deminishes as the photon energy further increases ( fig .",
    "the absorptive part of the @xmath42 is nonzero only above @xmath562.2 ev , and looks like a lorentzian oscillation between 2.2 and 6.0 ev with one sharp negative peak at @xmath56 2.5 ev and one broad positive peak around 5.5 ev ( fig .",
    "it is clear from equs . 2 - 3 that the calculated @xmath42 spectra can have pronounced features due to both single- and double - frequency resonant terms .",
    "to analyze the features in the calculated @xmath57 spectra , it is helpful to compare the absolute value of @xmath58 ( fig 1b ) with the absorptive part of the corresponding dielectric function @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite therefore , the calculated @xmath59 from our previous publication  @xcite are shown in fig . 1c as a function of both @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "clearly , the first sharp peak at @xmath562.5 ev is due to two - photon resonances [ cf .",
    "@xmath53 ] whilst in contrast , the second broad peak around 5.5 ev comes from the single - photon resonances [ cf .",
    "@xmath52 ] . nevertheless , both single- and double - photon resonances involve only interband @xmath64 and @xmath65 optical transitions for the electric field vector @xmath66 polarized parallel to the bn layer ( @xmath67 )  @xcite .",

    "in contrast , the density of states and dielectric function of the ( 12,0)@(20,0 ) as well as ( 12,0 ) and ( 20,0 ) bn - nts are very similar ,  @xcite indicating that the effects of interwall interaction on the electronic structure and linear optical properties would be small .",
    "in particular , the dielectric function of the ( 12,0)@(20,0 ) is nearly the same as that of the ( 20,0 ) .",
    "the reduction in the magnitude of @xmath57 may be explained by the fact that bulk @xmath4-bn does not show second - order nonlinear optical behavior and that a multi - walled bn - nt with a very large diameter is essentially equivalent to @xmath4-bn .",

    "<S> highly accurate full - potential projector augmented - wave method was used . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the second - harmonic generation ( @xmath0 ) and linear electro - optical ( @xmath1 ) coefficients of a large number of the single - walled zigzag , armchair and chiral bn nanotubes ( bn - nt ) as well as the double - walled zigzag ( 12,0)@(20,0 ) bn nanotube and the single - walled zigzag ( 12,0 ) bn - nt bundle have been calculated . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , unlike carbon nanotubes , both the zigzag and chiral bn - nts are found to exhibit large second - order nonlinear optical behavior with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 coefficients being up to thirty times larger than that of bulk bn in both zinc - blende and wurtzite structures , indicating that bn - nts are promising materials for nonlinear optical and opto - electric applications . though the interwall interaction in the double - walled bn - nts is found to reduce the second - order nonlinear optical coefficients significantly , the interwall interaction in the single - walled bn - nt bundle has essentially no effect on the nonlinear optical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the prominant features in the spectra of @xmath2 of the bn - nts are successfully correlated with the features in the linear optical dielectric function @xmath3 in terms of single - photon and two - photon resonances . </S>"
