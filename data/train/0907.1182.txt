    "after a decade of intense study on networks , almost all work done has concentrated on the limited case of a single network which does not interact with other networks @xcite .",
    "such situations rarely , if ever , occur in nature . just as in the case of idealized gas ,",
    "when interactions are present as in nature , new physical laws appear .",
    "analogously , due to technological progress , modern systems are becoming more and more coupled together . while in the past many networks would provide their functionality independently , modern systems depend on one another to provide proper functionality . for example , a power network in which the nodes are power stations and a communication network in which the nodes are computers , are interdependent , since nodes from the communication network rely for power supply on the power stations , while the power stations depend for their control on the proper functioning of the communication network .",
    "the critical importance of functional dependence of networks on each other has recently been recognized @xcite .    in interdependent networks , when nodes in one network fail , they cause dependent nodes in another network to fail .",
    "this may happen recursively and can lead to a cascade of failures .",
    "so a failure of a small faction of nodes in only one network , may lead to the complete fragmentation of all networks . here , we provide a framework for understanding the robustness of interacting networks subject to such cascading failures and provide the basic network analytic approach that can underlie future work in this area .",
    "we present a general model for interdependent networks that we solve analytically using tools from percolation theory and the apparatus of generating functions .",
    "we present exact analytical solutions for the critical fraction of nodes that upon removal will lead to a complete fragmentation of all networks .",
    "surprisingly , analyzing complex systems as a set of interdependent networks may destabilize the most basic assumptions that network theory has relied on for single networks .",
    "while for a single network a broader degree distribution of the network nodes results in the network being more robust to random failure , for interdependent networks , the broader the distribution is , the more vulnerable the networks become to random failure .",
    "the implications are dramatic  the current methods applied to the design of robust networks need to be modified to include the findings about interdependent networks .",
    "consider two networks a and b and assume that the functioning of a node in network a depends on the ability of one or more nodes in network b to supply a critical resource to the node in network a. similarly , a node in network b depends on a set of nodes in network a. the networks can be connected in different ways ; in the most general configuration one could specify the distributions of connections between the nodes from both networks .",
    "the networks can have the same , or different , topologies .",
    "the model can easily be extended to an arbitrary number of interacting networks each with its own specific topology and dependence on the other networks .",
    "for example , an interesting dependence for three interacting networks could be a circular dependency in which the nodes in network b depend on network a for a resource , the nodes of network c depend on the nodes of network b for a resource and the nodes of network a depend on network c for resources .",
    "our key insight from percolation theory is that for each of the networks to remain functional after nodes have failed , the network must include a spanning cluster of functional nodes .",
    "nodes that are not part of the spanning cluster will become nonfunctional and will cause the nodes from other networks that are connected to them to also become nonfunctional .    for simplicity and without loss of generality , we will assume a system of two networks , a and b , both with n nodes . within each network , we assume that nodes are randomly and independently connected with degree distributions @xmath2 and @xmath3 . we also assume , for simplicity , that each node in network a is connected to , and dependent on , one node in network b and vice - versa . next we will remove a fraction of nodes @xmath4 from network a and all the edges connected to these nodes , so that only a fraction @xmath5 remain functional .",
    "simultaneously , the corresponding nodes ( and their edges ) in network b are removed since they are dependent on the nodes in network a.    as edges are removed , the networks break up into connected components ( clusters ) . the clusters in network a and the clusters in network b will be different because the networks are each connected differently .",
    "we define a mutually - connected cluster as the set of nodes in network a which belong to a cluster in network a and also have their corresponding nodes in network b belong to a single cluster in network b ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "we assume that clusters of nodes that are disconnected from the network core ( giant component / spanning cluster ) become non - functional and are removed .",
    "thus , the mutually - connected giant component will be of special interest since it is the only functional part of the system .",
    "the questions that we will ask : what is the critical @xmath6 below which all the mutual clusters constitute only an infinitesimal fraction of the network , i.e. , no mutual giant component exist ? what is the probability @xmath7 for a node to belong to the mutual giant component as function of @xmath5 ? to solve this model we will introduce a recursive process which we will identify with a physically meaningful cascade of failures .    to solve this model",
    "we will first define the @xmath8-clusters of network a after only a fraction of nodes @xmath5 remain .",
    "next we will treat each of these @xmath8-clusters as separate subsets of a network b , i.e. all the b - edges connecting different @xmath8-clusters will be removed .",
    "we will define this state of the networks as the first stage in the cascade of failures .",
    "accordingly , each of the @xmath8-clusters may split into several @xmath9-clusters . some of the @xmath8-clusters will not split and will coincide with @xmath9 clusters .",
    "obviously such clusters are mutually connected .",
    "finally we remove from the network all @xmath10-edges connecting different @xmath9 clusters .",
    "we will define this state of the networks as the second stage in the cascade of failures .",
    "analogously , in the third stage we will determine all the @xmath11-clusters and in the fourth stage we will determine all the @xmath12-clusters , and will continue this process until no further splitting and edge - removal will occur .",
    "note that in this process the majority of new mutual clusters identified after each stage of failures will be isolated nodes , few of them will be of size 2 and very rarely we will have larger mutual clusters . indeed if we have two nodes that are connected by an a - edge , the probability that they will be connected by a @xmath13 edge is @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "the probability that three nodes connected by a - edges are also connected by @xmath13 edges scale as @xmath16 and so on .",
    "now we will solve the problem analytically using the apparatus of generating functions .",
    "as in refs .",
    "@xcite we will introduce generating functions of the degree distributions @xmath17 and @xmath18 analogously we will introduce generating functions of the underlining branching processes : @xmath19 and @xmath20    random removal of fraction @xmath4 of nodes will change the degree distribution of the remaining nodes @xcite , so that the new generating functions become @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 let us denote the subset of nodes after the random removal of @xmath4 nodes as @xmath25 .",
    "if the number of nodes in the entire network is @xmath26 , the number of nodes in @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "the fraction of nodes that belong to the giant component of the network @xmath29 is @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 satisfies a transcendental equation @xmath32 equation ( [ e : f_a ] ) can be simplified by substitution @xmath33 @xmath34 then eq .",
    "( [ e : p_a ] ) becomes @xmath35    analogous equations characterize the giant component of network @xmath36 . after the initial attack which removes @xmath37-fraction of nodes from both networks ,",
    "the first - stage failure is caused by the fragmentation of the subset @xmath29 .",
    "the giant component @xmath38 of @xmath29 will constitute @xmath39-fraction of @xmath29 .",
    "thus the number of nodes in @xmath38 is @xmath40 .",
    "after the first - stage failure the fraction of functioning nodes is @xmath41 ( subset @xmath38 ) . because the nodes of the networks b and a coincide , the same fraction of nodes remains functioning in network b. because the topology of network b is independent the topology of network a , these functioning nodes are totally random with respect to connections in network b. thus we can again apply the apparatus of generating functions and find the fraction @xmath42 of the giant component @xmath43 of network b with respect to the subset @xmath38 .",
    "the number of nodes in the giant component @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the fraction of functioning nodes after the second stage failure is @xmath46 ( subset @xmath43 ) .",
    "now we will analyze what happens during the third - stage failure which is caused by further fragmentation of the giant component @xmath38 by removal @xmath47 , nodes which do not belong to @xmath43 .",
    "the removal of these nodes form @xmath38 is equivalent to the removal of the same fraction of nodes from @xmath29 ( because all the nodes that were removed at the stage of the initial attack do not belong to @xmath43 , @xmath38 , and @xmath29 . the total number of nodes that must be removed from network a is @xmath48 nodes from @xmath29 plus the number of the initially attacked nodes @xmath49 . thus , the total number of nodes that must be removed from network a is @xmath50 .",
    "hence the third - stage failure is equivalent to a random attack in which @xmath5 is replaced by @xmath51 . accordingly",
    "the number of nodes in the giant component @xmath52 is @xmath53 .    following this approach",
    "we can construct the sequence of giant components in the cascade of failures : @xmath54 .",
    "the number of modes in each giant component of this sequence is @xmath55 , where the numbers @xmath56 can be obtained by recursive relations : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "now we will determine the size of the mutual giant component .",
    "the fraction of nodes in the mutual giant component , @xmath66 is the limit of the sequence @xmath56 for @xmath67 .",
    "this limit must satisfy the equations @xmath68 since the cluster is not further fragmented . using relations between @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and denoting @xmath71 and @xmath72 we arrive to a system of two symmetric equations with two unknowns :",
    "@xmath73 this system of equations has one trivial solution @xmath74 , @xmath75 for any @xmath5 , corresponding to the zero size of the giant mutual component . if @xmath5 is large enough there exists a different solution which gives the nonzero size of the mutual giant component .",
    "we can easily exclude @xmath76 from these equations and obtain a single equation @xmath77 this equation can be solved graphically  ( fig.[f:1 ] ) as the intersection of a straight line @xmath78 and a curve @xmath79 which both intersect at the origin .",
    "when @xmath5 is small enough the curve increases very slowly and does not intersect with the straight line .",
    "the critical case when the nontrivial solution emerges , corresponds to the case when the line touches the curve at a single point @xmath80 and in this point we have a condition @xmath81 , which together with equation @xmath82 gives the solution for the critical @xmath5 and the critical size of the mutual giant component .",
    "in case of er networks , whose degrees are poisson - distributed @xcite , the problem can be solved explicitly .",

    "numerical simulations of the er networks are in excellent agreement with the theory ( fig .",
    "[ f:3 ] ) .",
    "for regular percolation in a scale - free network with a power law degree distribution @xmath107 , it is known that @xmath108 , as @xmath109 for @xmath110 . surprisingly ,",
    "for mutual percolation this is not the case and @xmath97 remains finite for @xmath111 . to see this ,",
    "we can find analytical approximation for @xmath39 .",
    "first , we begin by solving eq.([e : z_a ] ) . according to tauberian theorems , for @xmath110",

    "thus we have a percolation transition at some @xmath130 .",
    "for interdependent networks we find the surprising behavior that networks with a broad degree distribution ( of the network nodes ) are more vulnerable to random attack compared to networks with a narrow distribution . to understand this result we note the following : 1 ) all interdependent networks are randomly connected",
    ", high degree nodes from one network might be connected to low degree nodes from the other networks .",
    "2 ) at each step when nodes ( and their links ) are disconnected from one network their corresponding nodes ( and their edges ) from the other network are also removed .    therefore ,",
    "the hubs that play such a dominant role in the robustness of single networks become vulnerable when a cascade of failures occurs in interdependent networks . moreover , for a network with a fixed average degree , a broader distribution means more nodes with low degree to balance the high degree nodes . since the low degree nodes are more easily disconnected the advantage of a broad distribution on single networks becomes a disadvantage for several interdependent networks .    in fig .",
    "[ avdegdistribution ] we compare simulation results for several sf networks with different @xmath131 values , an er network and a random regular ( rr ) network , all with an average degree @xmath132 .",
    "the simulation results are in full agreement with our analytical results and it can clearly be seen that for a broader distribution @xmath97 is indeed higher .",
    "our considerations are rigorous for @xmath133 . for a finite network ,",
    "the relative fluctuations of all fractions decrease as @xmath134 so , for the finite network , there is a range of values of @xmath5 for which the mutual giant component exists with probability @xmath135 ( fig .",
    "[ f:4 ] ) .",
    "its derivative diverges as @xmath133 as @xmath136 , and for @xmath133 , @xmath135 becomes a step function @xmath137 for @xmath138 and @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "the square - root scaling with @xmath26 of the width of the interval @xmath5 for which we can have a complete fragmentation for some realizations of networks and a giant component for the other realizations of the networks can be justified by the following arguments .",
    "the actual fraction of the remaining nodes @xmath141 in a finite network of size @xmath26 will be normally distributed around given @xmath5 with the standard deviation inverse proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "thus @xmath135 is equal to the probability that @xmath142 , which is equal to the integral of the normal probability density with zero mean and the same standard deviation from @xmath143 to infinity .",
    "therefore the derivative @xmath144 has a gaussian shape with standard deviation proportional to @xmath145 .",
    "the average number of stages @xmath146 in a cascade of failures for @xmath140 diverges proportionally to @xmath147 .",
    "this follows from the properties of the iterative process eq .",
    "( [ e : xpp ] ) .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that near @xmath6 , eq . ( [ e : xpp ] ) has two roots produced by the intersection of the curvy line which can be approximated by a parabola @xmath148 and a straight line @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ f:1 ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to solving a quadratic equation @xmath149 .",
    "the value @xmath6 is given by the discriminant of this equation equal to zero : @xmath150 . in the general case , all three parameters , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , have non - zero derivatives at @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , in the general case @xmath154 has also a non - zero derivative at @xmath6 , and hence the difference between the roots scales as @xmath155 .",
    "thus , the derivative of the curve at the largest root , which corresponds to the limit of the iterative process scales as @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is some positive constant . for eq.([system ] ) the iterations converge to the root as @xmath158 . in a real network , they will stop when the difference between two successive iterations will be smaller than one node , which yields a condition @xmath159 .",
    "hence indeed @xmath160 .    for @xmath138 the solution does not exist and the curve misses the line with the distance proportional to the negative descriminant . as the curve comes close to the line",
    "the steps are proportional to @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the minimal distance between the curve and the line .",
    "the number of such steps per @xmath163 is @xmath164 .",
    "the total number of steps are thus the integral of this quantity between @xmath165 and @xmath74 , which in the limit @xmath166 gives @xmath167 .",
    "exactly at the critical point @xmath6 the straight line touches the curve at a single point and the sequence of iterations converges as @xmath168 .",
    "these iterations converge to @xmath169 as @xmath170 which can be seen by plugging into this equation @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are some unknown constants .",
    "expanding @xmath174 in tailor series and equating coefficients for equal powers , one can see that @xmath175 . however , in real network , due to gaussian spread in @xmath141 , we are never at criticality , and the typical @xmath176",
