    "@xcite ( and references therein ) reported chromospheric emissions for five different star - planet couples that correlate with the planetary orbital period .",
    "these correlated emissions were observed to be subject to an on / off mechanism , possibly originating from the variability of the stellar magnetic field over time - scales of years , or over the orbital phase of the planet . the particular case of hd 189733 was recently revisited by @xcite , who interpreted the excess emission to result from an infall of planetary material towards the star",
    ". the surprising lack of x - ray emissions of wasp-18 is also thought to result from some star - planet interactions , which is yet to be understood .",
    "nevertheless , it is today clear that the enhancement ( or lack of thereof ) of chromospheric or coronal x - ray emissions due to a close - in planet is situational and highly variable : it does not statistically induce an observational trend ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "radio and uv emissions from star - planet magnetic interactions are also intensively researched today @xcite , as any detection may provide constraints on the hypothetical planetary magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the statistical distribution of exoplanets also reveals interesting features .",
    "first noted by @xcite , it appears that hosts of close - in planets tend to rotate more rapidly than non- close - in planets hosting twins .",
    "this was recently confirmed by , although the authors question the original explanation of @xcite based on tidal interactions because they do not seem to find a correlation between the anomalous gyrochronological age and the strength of the expected tidal forces .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed a clear dearth of close - in exoplanets around fast - rotators with kepler .",
    "both effects could be explained by exchanges of angular momentum between stars and close - in planets , although their detailed mechanism is still debated today .",
    "the aforementioned observations are generally interpreted in terms of tidal , radiative , or magnetic star - planet interactions .",
    "tides are known to lead to spin - orbit synchronisation in star - planet systems ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "the angular momentum transport resulting from star - planet tides can also lead to planet migration as well as spin - up the host star for close - in planets @xcite .",
    "planet - disk tidal interactions provide as well various migration mechanisms ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the early stages of stellar systems .",
    "the efficiency of tidal interactions strongly depends on the internal structure of both the star and the planet , and its modelling is still today a subject of intense research .",

    "* ) and may allow in some cases some planetary material to impact the stellar chromosphere . in the case of close - in non - magnetized planets , intense euv radiation was shown to favor the penetration of the stellar wind and may be a source of enhanced atmospheric escape @xcite .",
    "@xcite classified the different types of planetary outflows , though , further investigation is still required to elucidate how such flows could explain enhanced emissions or statistical trends in the exoplanet population ( see * ? ? ? * for a possible link between hot spots and radiation - induced planetary outflows ) .",
    "magnetic interactions provide another promising mechanism for the transfer of energy and angular moment between a star and a planet .",

    "in a pioneering work @xcite modelled such interaction as a plausible source for additional and localized coronal heating of close - in planet hosting stars . in this scenario ,",
    "contrary to radiative - induced planetary outflows , the energy is carried away from the planet by alfvnic perturbations propagating in the stellar wind down to the stellar chromosphere .",
    "the energetic transfers occurring due to magnetic interactions in a star - planet system can be modelled with the concept of alfvn wings @xcite , inspired by similar planet - satellite magnetic interactions occurring in the solar system @xcite .",
    "though , in star - planet systems , the detailed structure of the wind determines how the alfvn wings develop . the poynting flux in alfvn wings was quantified by @xcite for the known exoplanets at that time , using simple 1d stellar wind models .",
    "it could provide a source for the intermittent enhanced emissions sometimes observed in close - in exo - systems .",
    "the magnetic torques originating from star - planet magnetic interactions were proposed as well to be a source of planet migration @xcite and stellar spin - up @xcite . on the contrary , for fast rotating stars those magnetic torques can spin - down the star , albeit not efficiently enough to solve the so - called angular momentum problem for young stars @xcite . as in the case of tidal interactions ,",

    "we use the pluto code @xcite to model star - planet magnetic interactions .",

    "we study two different stellar winds using dipolar and quadrupolar magnetic fields to explore the effects of the magnetic topology on spmis .",

    "the dipolar case is characterized by a normalized alfvn speed of @xmath32 , and in the quadrupolar case @xmath33 .",
    "this ensures that the total pressure at the planet orbit ( dominated by the magnetic pressure , see section [ sec : planet - models ] ) is equivalent in both winds .",
    "because the coronal base density @xmath34 is used to adimensionalize the mhd equations , each stellar wind simulation can represent the wind of different stars .",
    "we give in table [ tab : tabw ] the magnetic field strength at the base of our models ( along with the wind mass and angular momentum loss rates , and the generalized alfvn radius @xmath35 ) for a coronal base density chosen to achieve a solar - like mass loss rate ( @xmath36 g/@xmath37 in the dipolar case , and @xmath38 g/@xmath37 in the quadrupolar case ) . in the remainder of this paper , the dimensional quantities",
    "are given using these base coronal densities unless stated otherwise .",
    "the planet is modelled as a second internal boundary condition inside the computational domain .",
    "we consider here planets in circular orbits with an orbital plane perpendicular to the stellar rotation axis .",
    "the mhd equations are solved in a frame rotating at the keplerian orbital rate of the planet @xmath39 ( in the limit of a small planetary mass ) , where @xmath40 is the orbital radius .",
    "the boundary cells composing the star and the planet are fixed in the rotating frame , simplifying significantly the numerical setup .    in this study we set the planetary mass and radius to @xmath41 and @xmath42 as in @xcite .",
    "we also hold fix the orbital radius @xmath43 .",
    "we consider planets with an intrinsic dipolar magnetic field oriented along the rotation axis of the host star and simulate three topological situations . using the dipolar wind solution , we consider the cases of planet with a dipolar field aligned with the _ local _ magnetic field ( hereafter the aligned case ) , and of a planet with an anti - aligned dipolar field ( hereafter anti - aligned ) . with the quadrupolar wind solution we simulate a planet with a dipolar field parallel to the stellar rotation axis , and hence perpendicular to the _ local _ magnetic field ( hereafter the perpendicular case ) .",
    "we show the three magnetic configurations in figure [ fig : config_2d ] , where the stellar wind field lines are shown in black and the planetary field lines in red . in the dipolar wind cases the planetary dipole strength corresponds to an equatorial field at the planetary surface @xmath44 g ( roughly 5 times less than the jovian magnetic field ) , and in the quadrupolar wind cases",
    "@xmath45 g. such planetary fields ensure extended planetary magnetospheres , while not constraining too much the numerical time steps .",
    "the planet is initialized at the beginning of the simulations along with the stellar wind ( see section [ sec : stellar - winds ] ) .",
    "we choose to neglect any kind of atmospheric escape to focus our study on the magnetic interactions solely ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an overview of the impact of atmospheric escape and planetary winds in the context of spmis ) .",
    "the density of the planetary boundary is chosen to be ten times the local wind density , and the pressure to be @xmath46 of the local thermal pressure of the wind .",
    "this ensures that the planet is a cold , dense obstacle in the stellar wind from which no wind is triggered . setting a higher density and/or a lower pressure changes very marginally",
    "the structure of the planetary magnetosphere close to the planet boundary , and does not affect our results regarding the interaction between the planetary magnetosphere , the stellar wind and its host star . the velocity inside the planet and its magnetosphere is initially set to 0 in the rotating frame , effectively modelling the orbital motion of the planet and its magnetosphere .",
    "we hence consider here only planet that are `` tidally - locked '' , which is a reasonable assumption for such close - in planets .",
    "the `` tidal - locking '' timescale for close - in jupiter - like planets is estimated to be of the order of 0.1 - 1 myr , which is shorter than the typical migration timescales associated with magnetic torques we derive in section [ sec : magnetic - torques ] .",
    "we hence consider in this work that the planet is already tidally - locked on a circular orbit to focus on the magnetic torques themselves .",
    "the velocity , density , and pressure are held fixed during the simulation inside the planet boundary and left free to evolve in the magnetosphere . the magnetic field",
    "is maintained to the initial planetary dipole in the inner @xmath47 of the planet and left free to evolve elsewhere .",
    "the planet boundary condition hence possesses an outer layer in which only the magnetic field is allowed to change , crudely mimicking a thick ionosphere .",
    "after its initialization , the planetary magnetosphere dynamically changes until a steady - state is reached , in which the pressure balance determines the shape of the magnetosphere . in the case",
    "we consider here , the total pressure in the planet vicinity is dominated by the magnetic pressure , which ensures that the magnetic interaction develops in the sub - alfvnic regime .",
    "we use the modular pluto code @xcite to solve the ideal mhd equations ( [ eq : mass_consrv_pluto]-[eq : eos ] ) .",
    "the equations are solved with a second - order , linear spatial interpolation coupled to the standard _",
    "riemann solver and a _ minmod _ flux limiter .",
    "the variables are updated in time with a second - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the solenoidality of the magnetic field is ensured to machine precision with a constrained transport method @xcite , in which the face - centered electromotive forces are arithmetically averaged .",
    "we solve the mhd equations in cartesian geometry with two internal boundary conditions inside the domain , modelling the star ( section [ sec : stellar - winds ] ) and the planet ( section [ sec : planet - models ] ) .",
    "we recall that the equations are solved in a rotating frame with the rotation rate @xmath48 , ensuring that the location of the planet can be held fixed in the simulation grid . at the domain external boundaries we impose simple outflow conditions ( zero - gradient on all quantities ) . because we model stellar winds , the flow is supersonic and super - alfvnic when it reaches the outer boundaries , hence they have little to no impact on the general solution which is driven by the internal stellar boundary condition .",
    "the simulation are run on a 490 @xmath49 355 @xmath49 355 cartesian grid .",
    "the cube of size @xmath50 enclosing the central star is discretized over @xmath51 uniform cells in each direction , and the cube of size @xmath52 enclosing the planet over @xmath53 uniform cells .",
    "the remainder of the simulation domain is filled with stretched grids in the three directions towards the domain s limits @xmath54 ^ 3 $ ] .    we stress that we use an ideal set of mhd equations ( section [ sec : magn - hydr - equat ] ) which implies that the only dissipative processes occurring in our simulations are controlled by the numerical scheme and the resolution we choose .",
    "this limitation is a reasonable trade - off between numerical simplicity and physical accuracy of our models .",
    "indeed , in all the cases we consider in this work the star - planet system quickly reaches a steady - state because the planet is orbiting in a purely axisymmetric wind ( see section [ sec : stellar - winds ] ) . as a result , the detailed reconnection process between , _",
    "e.g. _ , the stellar wind and the planetary magnetosphere , only marginally influences the final steady - state .",
    "this is confirmed with additional simulations we ran with half - resolution in the cube of size @xmath52 around the planet , which encloses the main reconnection sites . in these simulations",
    "the energy and angular momentum transfers ( see sections [ sec : alfven - wings ] and [ sec : magnetic - torques ] ) are decreased by less than @xmath55 .",
    "hence , higher resolution , more accurate simulations would lead to slightly stronger magnetic interaction , but not qualitatively change the results presented in this work , as expected .",
    "nevertheless , because we chose an ideal mhd approach , our model is not suited to tackle the dynamical response of the interaction to perturbations or non - axisymmetric structures in the stellar wind .",
    "hence , we only consider the case of axisymmetric stellar winds in this work .",
    "thanks to pluto modular capabilities , such dynamical processes could be studied more accurately by taking into account explicit ohmic , hall , and eventually ambipolar dissipation ( these effects are not included in the public version of pluto yet , for first implementations see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these aspects are beyond the scope of the present work and will be explored in future studies .",
    "the concept of alfvn wings goes back to the pioneering work of @xcite , in the context of satellites moving perpendicularly to a uniform magnetic field .",
    "such satellite excites alfvnic perturbations that propagate along the magnetic field lines , effectively developing currents resembling planes swept - back `` wings '' .",
    "we detail in this section how alfvn wings develop in close - in star - planet systems , and how the magnetic topology affects their shape and characteristics .",
    "alfvn wings develop in close - in star - planet systems due to the differential motion between the orbiting planet and the rotating , stellar wind .",
    "the orbiting planet excites magneto - hydrodynamic perturbations in the stellar wind that propagate along the alfvn characteristics @xcite    @xmath56    these perturbations are a vector of electromagnetic energy and angular momentum transport between the planet and its environment , the latter being either the interplanetary medium or the host star .",
    "the superposition of the travelling perturbations form what is referred to as an `` alfvn wing '' @xcite .",
    "if the local alfvn speed is sufficiently high and the planet is located inside the alfvn surface of the stellar wind , some of the perturbations can be reflected at the stellar surface and reach back the orbiting planet .",
    "this extreme case is often referred to as the _ unipolar inductor _ case , while the case where no perturbations reach back the planet is called the _ pure alfvn wing _ case .",
    "the star - planet system systematically develops two alfvn wings , along @xmath57 and @xmath58 , located in the @xmath59 plane , where @xmath60 is the stellar wind magnetic field and @xmath61 is the differential motion between the planet and the wind ( @xmath62 is the keplerian velocity ) .",
    "we display in figure [ fig : alfw_3d ] the global structure of the alfvn wings ( right panels ) with close - ups on the vicinity of the planet ( left panels ) for each of three cases we consider .",
    "the parallel currents @xmath63 often referred to as _ alfvn wing currents _ ( due to the fact that they delimit aflvn wings , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are shown by the red ( positive ) and blue ( negative ) volume renderings .",
    "these volume rendering are extruded at the vertical star - planet plane to make their internal structure apparent .",
    "the magnetic field lines connected to the planet are shown in gray , and the magnetic field lines connected to the star are color - coded by the logarithm of the magnetic field strength .",
    "the orbit of the planet is symbolized by the black dashed circle , and the star and the planet are respectively represented by the orange and blue spheres .                 in the case of a dipolar stellar magnetic field ( upper and middle panels )",
    ", the two alfvn wings are connected to the star at high latitude .",
    "conversely , in the quadrupolar stellar wind ( lower panels ) , only one of the two alfvn wings is connected to the star on the magnetic equator .",
    "the footprint of the wings is generally out of phase from the planetary orbital phase due to the finite propagation time of the alfvnic disturbances from the planet vicinity to the stellar surface ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in all cases the alfvnic perturbations rapidly travel the planet - star distance along the alfvn wings in less than 2 hours , which is less than @xmath64 of the orbital time @xmath65 days",
    ". as a result",
    ", we observe a small phase lag due to the fast propagation time and the small inclination angle of the wings ( see hereafter equation [ eq : angle_wing ] and table [ tab : tab0 ] ) .",
    "the travel time is nevertheless always larger than the typical advection time across the planetary diameter @xmath66 minutes , due to the fast orbital motion of the close - in planet .",
    "hence , these perturbations are likely to never reach back the orbiting planet and our simulations are always in the pure alfvn wings regime .",
    "the upper and middle right panels differ only by an inversion of the planetary magnetic field .",
    "we immediately remark the importance of topology : in the aligned case the alfvn wings are broader and the currents much stronger than in the anti - aligned case . as a result",
    "the alfvn wings are expected to carry much less energy and angular momentum in the anti - aligned case .    in the upper panel of figure [ fig : alfw_2d ]",
    "we quantify the parallel currents nearby the planet .",
    "we show a side cut of the planet vicinity ( the star is located leftwards in those cuts ) , for which the keplerian orbital motion of the planet is into the plane .",
    "the black lines represent the magnetic field lines .",
    "the parallel currents are again shown by the red ( positive ) and blue ( negative ) colormap .",
    "they are normalized by @xmath67 , thus effectively estimating the ratio between @xmath68 and the time - scale associated with the parallel currents .",
    "the most intense currents are found at the boundary between the planetary magnetic field lines and the wind : they originate from the planet - wind interaction as a simple rotational discontinuity .",
    "they are associated with very short time - scales compared to the advection time - scale @xmath68 and trace the comparatively fast reconnection rate between the planetary and wind magnetic fields as the planet orbits in the wind .",
    "we stress here again that the aligned and anti - aligned cases ( two left panels ) develop very different interaction patterns . in the aligned case",
    ", the strong currents are localized at the open  close magnetic field lines boundary and at the alfvn wing boundaries . in the anti - aligned case ,",
    "they are mainly localized at the magnetsophere - wind boundary .",
    "the perpendicular case shows an in - between situation where the strong currents delimit the alfvn wings boundaries , and the magnetosphere - wind interface .",
    "the alfvn wings plane @xmath69 is shown in the middle panels .",
    "the black lines again represent the magnetic field lines , where the thicker lines are the planetary magnetic field lines ( the planetary magnetic field lines pervade the alfvn wings plane in the perpendicular case , since the alfvn wings plane coincided with the orbital plane in this case ) . in all cases",
    "the stellar wind magnetic field lines are bent downstream due to the interaction with the planet .",
    "the difference between aligned and anti - aligned configurations clearly appears : in the aligned case the extended polar magnetic field lines of the planet allow for a large area of magnetic interaction with the wind , whereas in the anti - aligned case the planetary magnetopshere remains in a closed configuration . in both cases ,",
    "though , alfvn wings develop , symbolized by the blue ( @xmath70 ) and red ( @xmath71 ) streamlines of the alfvn characteristics .",
    "the expected theoretical inclination angle @xmath72 between the ambient magnetic field and the alfvn wings is shown by the magenta dashed lines and is given in those cases by @xcite @xmath73 where the wind aflvn mach number is defined by @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the angle between @xmath76 and @xmath60 ( note that in @xcite @xmath75 is the departure of perpendicularity between @xmath77 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the theoretical inclination angle @xmath78 is expected to be independant of the planetary magnetic field strength , which is held fixed in our three cases .",
    "the theoretical estimate @xmath78 compares reasonably well with the simulated alfvn wings inclination angle @xmath72 ( averaged over the two wings , the characteristics of the alfvn wings are summarized in table [ tab : tab0 ] ) .",
    "the background colormap shows the aziumthal velocity in the frame where the planet is at rest , normalized to the keplerian velocity @xmath79 . in all cases",
    "the magnetosphere of the planet orbits with the planet ( white regions ) , as well as the portion of the alfvn wings intersected by the cutting plane .",
    "finally , in the lower panels we display the flow in the rest frame of the planet ( blue streamlines ) and the plasma density ( logarithmic colormap , normalized to the planet density ) on the planetary orbital plane . in the first two panels the flow is primarily in the orbital direction because the planet orbits inside the dead - zone of the stellar corona , where the radial flow of the stellar wind is negligible .",
    "the effective obstacle is larger on the equatorial plane in the anti - aligned case due its larger magnetospheric extent ( this is also apparent in the middle panels ) .",
    "the effective obstacle is nevertheless three - dimensional and is generally much bigger in the aligned case ( see section [ sec : magnetic - torques ] ) .",
    "no strong wake is observed downstream since we chose to neglect planetary outflows , and that the interaction is sub - alfvnic . in the third panel , the stellar wind magnetic field lines are open in the orbital plane . the flow is consequently composed of the orbital motion and the accelerating radial wind .",
    "the planetary obstacle is observed to be much larger than the planetary magnetosphere .",
    "indeed , the alfvn wings extend toward and away from the star on the orbital plane and act as a supplementary obstacle to the flow ( see also the @xmath80 colormaps in the middle panels ) .",
    "since we considered the idealized case of a planet with no intrinsic mass loss , the high planet density does not propagate to more than a few grid points inside the planet magnetosphere .",
    "varying the planet internal density only marginally affects our results . the detailed density pattern in the planetary magnetosphere is found to have very little impact on the alfvn wings properties .",

    "the poynting flux in each alfvn wing can be evaluated by @xmath90 where the electric field is @xmath91 in the ideal mhd approximation .",
    "the poynting flux depends on the frame in which it is calculated , as a result we consider here the inertial reference frame to mimic what a distant observer would see when observing such a system .",
    "because the central star slowly rotates , this frame also conveniently corresponds to the stellar reference frame , and the poynting flux corresponds to the energy that may be deposited on the star due to the spmi .",

    "for the quadrupolar stellar wind ( right panels ) the alfvn wings are centered on the orbital plane , hence we display the poynting flux along the @xmath71 alfvn wing on vertical cutting planes in between the planet and the star . in each panel , the blue circle and the dashed line respectively represent the projection of the planet and of its orbital trajectory on the cutting plane .    comparing the aligned and anti - aligned cases ( left two panels ) , we immediately observe the strong poynting flux concentrated inside the alfvn wing in the aligned case , while in the anti - aligned case the poynting flux is extremely weak . in all cases the flux is nevertheless positive , denoting a flux of energy towards the star . in the aligned and perpendicular cases",
    "the alfvn wing is tear - shaped in the direction of the flow ( grey arrows ) , and the maximum poynting flux is localized close to the side of the wing facing the flow . in these two cases the alfvn wing clearly acts as an obstacle to the flow .",
    "conversely , in the anti - aligned case , the very small cross - section of the alfvn wing makes only a small perturbation to the flow , as seen in the middle panels . as the cutting plane is shifted away from the planet ( from top to bottom ) , the alfvn wing center is observed to shift towards the star and downstream .",
    "the cross - section of the alfvn wing perpendicular to the flow , @xmath93 , is indicated by the double arrows in figure [ fig : poynting_flux ] , and computed by taking the maximal extent of the wing perpendicular to the flow .",
    "it remains approximately constant along the wing as long as the cutting plane remains roughly perpendicular .",
    "@xcite used a simple magneto - static equilibrium code to estimate the expected @xmath84 as a function of the standard obstacle radius @xmath94 ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",

    "e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "because of the magneto - static equilibrium assumed to derive equation , we do not expect it to exactly match our observed effective radii @xmath84 .",
    "the estimated and simulated effective radii @xmath84 are given in table [ tab : tab0 ] .",
    "it appears that the theoretical value slightly over - estimates the effective radius we obtain in our simulation .",
    "the shape of the simulated alfvn wing cross - section is much more elongated in the flow direction than the theoretical alfvn wing of @xcite . as a result",
    ", this effect compensates the discrepancy in the effective radii of the obstacle , and the theoretical and simulated wings have similar cross - section areas .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the poynting flux scales remarkably well with the predicted value of @xmath99 expected from the analytical estimates of @xcite . by integrating the total poynting flux inside the area",
    "@xmath100 delimited by black contours in figure [ fig : poynting_flux ] ( effectively delimiting the alfvn wing cross - section ) , we find that the total poynting flux is close to being constant throughout each wing .",
    "we report the average value of the integrated poynting flux @xmath101 in table [ tab : tab0 ] , where @xmath102 stands for an average along the alfvn wing .",
    "the theoretical and simulated poynting fluxes agree within a factor of two , which is satisfying given the approximations embedded in both the analytical and numerical models . the total poynting flux is smaller by a factor of @xmath103 between the aligned and the anti - aligned cases .",
    "this topological effect could provide a simple explanation to the on / off enhanced emissions observed in extreme exo - systems over the time - scales of typical stellar magnetic cycles or orbital periods .",
    "we have demonstrated that our numerical model is able to simulate adequately alfvn wings that compare well with analytical theory estimates .",
    "we now focus on the less studied magnetic torques , which can play a role in the secular evolution of close - in star - planet systems .",
    "torques in magnetic star - planet systems can be separated in contributions from ram pressure , thermal pressure , magnetic pressure , and magnetic tension .",
    "we derive the angular momentum fluxes associated with those torques in a frame rotating at the planetary orbital rate .",
    "the angular momentum is defined with respect to the stellar rotation axis , which coincides with the orbital axis for the cases considered in this work .",
    "the interested reader will find the derivation of the various torques expressions in appendix [ sec : expr - torq - star ] .",
    "thanks to angular momentum conservation , these torques can be evaluated on any surface enclosing the planet . as a result",
    "we estimate the torques from integrations over concentric spheres around the planet , and _ a posteriori _ check that the total torque @xmath104 ( black lines in figure [ fig : torq_p ] ) is indeed constant with the integration radius .",
    "the different components of the torque are detailed in figure [ fig : torq_p ] .        in the aligned and perpendicular cases ( left and right panels ) ,",
    "the torque is dominated by the tension of the magnetic field lines connecting the planet to the star ( green line ) .",
    "it is slightly opposed by the magnetic pressure ( cyan line ) while the ram and thermal pressures play almost no role in the the overall torque .",
    "note that in the three cases , the magnetic pressure ( cyan ) changes sign as the integration sphere surrounding the planet is expanded .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the fact that the magnetosphere of the planet is more extended downstream than upstream . as a result",
    ", the integration is imbalanced toward the downstream contribution and gives a negative contribution when the integration spheres are fully inside the planetary magnetosphere .",
    "when the integration sphere is fully outside the planetary magnetosphere , the magnetic pressure contribution to the torque is positive , as expected .    in the anti - aligned case ( middle panel ) , the total torque is the combination of both magnetic tension and pressure , corresponding to the wind magnetic field lines impacting the closed planetary magnetosphere",
    ". the ram and thermal pressures play here a marginal role as well in the total torque .",
    "the torque applied to the planet in the aligned case is roughly @xmath105 of the stellar wind torque applying to the host star .",
    "because the two alfvn wings connect back to the star , it means that the star brakes @xmath105 less efficiently than a twin star not harbouring any close - in planet .",
    "the torque in the aligned case is furthermore approximately five times higher than in the anti - aligned case , showing again the very strong impact of the magnetic topology on the strength of the spmi .",
    "the perpendicular case shows a very similar repartition of the different contribution than the aligned cases , with a slightly higher magnetic pressure .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the perpendicular case only one wing connects the star and the planet , as a result only half of the angular momentum extracted from the orbit of the planet will be transfered to the star , while the other half will be advected in the wind .",
    "hence , the impact of the spmi on the host star is maximized in the aligned case .",
    "we further calculate the migration time - scale associated with those torques , given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the orbital angular momentum of the planet , and the factor @xmath108 originates from the @xmath109 dependance of @xmath110 .",
    "the migration time - scale depends on the density normalization @xmath34 . in table",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] we give the migration timescales ( as well as the average torques @xmath104 ) for a @xmath34 normalization corresponding to a ttauri - star mass - loss rate ( five orders of magnitude higher than the sun , corresponding as well to a much stronger stellar magnetic field ) .",
    "the time - scales are clearly sufficiently short to suggest that magnetic interactions can play a role in the migration of close - in planets , especially during the early stages ( typically ttauri and pre - main sequence phases ) of star - planet systems .",
    "the density normalization divides the migration time - scale @xmath111 when computing it from adimensionalized units . for a solar - like density normalization ( see section [ sec : stellar - winds ] )",
    ", the time - scales would be 5 orders of magnitude higher and be negligible compared to typical tidal effects .",
    "preliminary scaling - laws for the migration timescales of close - in planets were derived @xcite from reduced 2.5d simulations .",
    "the variation of @xmath111 with topology in our 3d models agrees with the predicted law from @xcite , and the orbital radius dependency is not expected to significantly change from 2.5d to 3d models .",
    "though , the torques differ qualitatively because the multiplicative constant in front of the scaling law derived in @xcite was calibrated with 2.5d models . by using a grid of 3d numerical simulations ( currently under investigation ) , we intend to better constrain this multiplicative constant to obtain a quantitatively accurate scaling law in a near future .",
    "this extended set of simulations shall also confirm the dependency of the migration timescale @xmath111 on the orbital radius @xmath40 found in @xcite .",
    "finally , close - in star - planet systems can also be in a super - alfvnic interaction regime ( not explored here ) . indeed ,",
    "even if the wind in the vicinity of the planet is sub - alfvnic , the relative fast orbital motion can exceed the local alfvn speed .",
    "how the torque scaling - law changes between the sub- and super - alvnic regimes still remains to be explored .      by analogy with an obstacle in a flow , the magnetic torque applied to the planet due to the spmi",

    ", the connection between the planetary field and the wind magnetic field leads to an interaction cross - section composed of the whole flux - tube connecting the star and the planet ( which width is given by @xmath124 , see table [ tab : tab0 ] ) , and hence to a much greater torque ( as seen in figure [ fig : torq_p ] ) .",
