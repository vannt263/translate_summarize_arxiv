    "studies of ultrafast nonlinear optical spectroscopy in semiconductors have attracted numerous interest both experimentally and theoretically during the past 20 years.@xcite most of these studies are focused on the optical coherence and the studies of spin coherence are relatively rare .",
    "recently , ultrafast nonlinear optical experiments@xcite have shown that the spin coherence which is optically excited by laser pulse can last much longer than optical coherence . for undoped znse / zncdse quantum wells",
    ", it is found in the experiment that the spin coherence can last up to 15 - 20  ps@xcite where as for undoped bulk gaas , it lasts about 600  ps.@xcite for @xmath2-doped material , the spin coherence can last up to three orders of magnitude longer than the undoped sample which makes 8  ns for znse / zncdse quantum well@xcite and 100  ns for bulk gaas.@xcite these discoveries have given rise to an emerging interest within the physics and electronic engineering communities in using electronic spins for the storage of coherence and also have stimulated the optimism that the coherent electrons will finally be realized as a basis for quantum computation .",
    "the electron spin coherence can be directly observed by femtosecond time - resolved faraday rotation ( fr ) in the voigt configuration . in that configuration a moderate magnetic field is applied normal to the growth axis of the sample .",
    "the coherence is introduced by a circularly polarized pump pulse that creates electrons and holes with an initial spin orientation normal to the magnetic field .",
    "then the magnetic field causes the electron spin to flip back and forth along the growth axis which makes the net spin precess about the magnetic field .",
    "the hole spin is kept along the growth axis direction of the quantum well as will be discussed below . after a certain delay time @xmath3 , a linearly polarized probe pulse is sent into the sample along a slightly different direction from the pump pulse and by measuring the fr angle , one can sensitively detect the net spin of electrons associated with the delay time @xmath3 .",
    "this method has proven to be extremely successful in measuring the coherent spin evolution and spin dephasing.@xcite    in order to further extend the spin coherence time , it is important to understand the physics of spin dephasing . while there is extensive theoretical study and understanding of the optical dephasing,@xcite the theoretical investigation on the spin dephasing",
    "is relatively limited , nevertheless of much longer history.@xcite the early work includes that of elliott in 1954 , who discussed the spin relaxation@xcite induced by lattice and impurity scatterings by taking into account the spin - obit effects.@xcite later , in 1975 bir _",
    "et al . _ calculated the spin dephasing using a model hamiltonian describing the electron - hole spin exchange ( ehse ) by considering coulomb scattering between electron and hole , combined with the spin - obit - coupling induced band mixing.@xcite in that paper by using fermi golden rule , bir _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a spin relaxation rate which is proportional to the hole density .",
    "it was not until 90 s that experimentalists found such an effect and claim the ehse is important in the intrinsic and @xmath4-doped semiconductors.@xcite for @xmath2-doped samples , however , as the density of the electrons is much higher than that of the holes , the holes recombine with electrons in a time much shorter than the measured spin dephasing time .",
    "as the predicted spin dephasing rate induced by ehse is proportional to hole density,@xcite it is therefore suggested that for @xmath2-doped sample , the dephasing mechanism is unclear.@xcite recently linder and sham@xcite presented a theory of the spin coherence of excitons by studying bloch equations .",
    "however , they did not discuss the dephasing mechanisms explicitly , and instead described all the dephasing by using phenomenological relaxation times .    in this paper ,",
    "we present a model to study the kinetics of spin precession of a femtosecond laser - pulse excited dense plasma in a quantum well in the framework of the semiconductor bloch equations combined with carrier - carrier scattering in the markovian limit .",
    "non - markovian effects are not important in our case , as the width of the laser pulse is large ( 100  fs ) and the time scale of spin dephasing is very long .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to understand the spin decoherence .",
    "it has been well known that both carrier - carrier coulomb scattering and carrier - phonon scattering play significant roles in the optical dephasing . for the 2d carrier density around 10@xmath5  @xmath6 in the experiment,@xcite",
    "the main carriers are electron - hole plasma and the coulomb scattering gives a fast dephasing of the optical coherence with dephasing times ranging from tens of femtoseconds to subpicoseconds,@xcite depending on the strength and width of the pump pulse and/or the density of doping , which affects the building up of the screening.@xcite besides the fast dephasing due to coulomb scattering , carrier - phonon scattering also contributes to the optical dephasing with the dephasing time being around ten picoseconds and carrier - density independent . for spin coherence , the experimental evidence that the spin dephasing depends strongly on the carrier density@xcite clearly rules out the possibility that the main mechanism of the spin dephasing is due to carrier - phonon scattering .",
    "therefore we focus on the effect of carrier - carrier scattering .",
    "we distinguish the spin coherence from the optical coherence and study the roles of coulomb scattering and ehse to the spin dephasing separately .",
    "we find that the pure coulomb scattering  although it destroys the optical coherence strongly  does not contribute to the spin dephasing at all , and that ehse is the main mechanism of the spin decoherence .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we present our model and kinetic equations in sec .",
    "then in sec .",
    "iii we present the numerical results for an undoped znse / zn@xmath0cd@xmath1se quantum well .",
    "a conclusion of our main results and a discussion of the theory for the @xmath2-doped sample are given in sec .",
    "we start our investigation of a quantum well with its growth axis in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "a moderate magnetic field @xmath8 is applied in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "landau quantization is unimportant for the magnetic field @xmath8 in our investigation .",
    "we consider the conduction band ( cb ) and the heavy hole ( hh ) valence band ( vb ) . due to the presence of the magnetic field",
    ", the spins of electrons and holes are no longer degenerate and therefore each band is further separated into two spin bands with spin @xmath10 for electrons in the cb and @xmath11 for those in the hh vb .",
    "it is noted that these spin eigenstates are defined with respect to the @xmath7-direction .    in the presence of the moderate magnetic field and with the interactions with a coherent classical light field , the hamiltonian for electrons in the cb and vb is given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 standing for the cb and the vb respectively .",
    "@xmath15 is the energy spectrum of an electron in the vb ( cb ) with momentum @xmath16 .",
    "it is noted that @xmath16 here stands for a momentum vector in the @xmath9-@xmath17 plane . @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 denoting effective masses of hh and electron separately .",
    "@xmath22 is unrenormalized band gap and @xmath23 is the spin index . for electron in the cb , @xmath24 and for electron in the hh vb , @xmath25 .",

    "the light field is further split into @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the central frequency of the coherent light pulse .",
    "@xmath41 describes a gaussian pulse @xmath42 with @xmath43 denoting the pulse width .",
    "@xmath44 is the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "as said before , we focus on the carrier - carrier scattering .",
    "therefore @xmath44 is composed of coulomb scattering and ehse@xcite with the later being much weaker than the coulomb scattering.@xcite @xmath45 the first term of eq .",
    "( [ hee ] ) is the ordinary coulomb interaction .",
    "the second term describes the `` direct '' ehse which scatters an electron in the band @xmath46 with spin @xmath23 and momentum @xmath16 to the same band with spin @xmath23 and momentum @xmath47 and in the mean time which scatters an electron from the different band @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) with spin @xmath50 and momentum @xmath51 back to that band with spin @xmath50 and momentum @xmath52 .",
    "the last term is `` exchange '' ehse which scatters an electron in the band @xmath46 with spin @xmath23 and momentum @xmath51 to the different band @xmath48 ( @xmath53 ) with spin @xmath50 and momentum @xmath52 and in the mean time which scatters an electron from the band @xmath48 with spin @xmath50 and momentum @xmath16 back to band @xmath46 with spin @xmath23 and momentum @xmath47 .",
    "it is noted here that @xmath23 and @xmath50 stand for @xmath10 when they are at the cb and @xmath11 when they are at the vb . as the exchange effect involves a form factor which consists the overlap of the wavefunctions of the cb and vb , @xmath54 is much smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , it will be shown later that the exchange effect is also energetically unfavorable as it scatters carriers across the band .",
    "therefore the direct ehse is the dominant effect .    for voigt configuration ,",
    "as @xmath56 is along the @xmath9 direction and @xmath57 , one can see directly from eq .",
    "( [ hal ] ) that the spin of hh can not be flipped by the magnetic field .",
    "we point here that this is only true when the magnetic field is small compared to the hh - light hole splitting and hence the flip between the hh and the light hole can be neglected in the timescale of the discussion . as @xmath58 with @xmath59 standing for pauli matrix ,",
    "it is therefore straightforward to see from the hamiltonian that the magnetic field causes the cb electron spin to flip and flop .",
    "it can be seen directly from the hamiltonian @xmath31 that the laser pulse introduces the optical coherences into the system which are built between the cb and the vb with same spin direction : @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in the mean time , due to the presence of the magnetic field in eq .",
    "( [ hal ] ) , these optical coherences may further transfer coherence to @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , with the first two being the coherence between the cb and vb with opposite spin directions and the last one being the coherence between two cb s with opposite spin directions . while it is well known that optical coherence is represented by @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we will show later that the spin coherence of electrons is represented by @xmath67 .",
    "when there is no dephasing effect added on this term , the electron spin precession will last forever .",
    "moreover , when @xmath68 decays to zero , there is no electron spin precession . therefore we refer it as spin coherence in the following .",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 , which describe the coherence between the states with the optical transition between them being forbidden by the selection rule , may play certain role in the optical dephasing and we will refer them hereafter as forbidden optical coherences .",
    "finally there is also a coherence between two vb s with opposite spin directions : @xmath71 . in the absence of spin flip of the hh , this coherence is much weaker than the other coherences as it then can only be excited by the laser pulse through the coupling to the forbidden coherence .",
    "therefore in the present discussion of undoped material , we do not include it in our model .",
    "we build the semiconductor bloch equations for the quantum well by nonequilibrium green function method@xcite as follows : @xmath72 here @xmath73 represents a single particle density matrix with @xmath46 and @xmath74 or @xmath14 .",
    "the diagonal elements describe the carrier distribution functions @xmath75 of the band @xmath46 , the wave vector @xmath16 and the spin @xmath23 .",
    "it is further noted that @xmath76 represents the electron distribution function with @xmath77 and @xmath78 with @xmath79 denoting the hh distribution function and @xmath80 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements describe the inter spin - band polarization components ( coherences ) we defined at the end of the previous subsection with @xmath81 for the inter cb - vb polarization and @xmath82 for the spin coherence .",
    "it is noticed here that for @xmath83 , the first spin index @xmath23 always corresponds to the spin index of the electron in the cb ( @xmath10 ) and the second spin index @xmath50 always corresponds to that of the hh vb ( @xmath11 ) .",

    "as mentioned before , the selection rule requires that the optical transition can only happen between the conduction and the valence bands with the same spin direction .",
    "this selection rule is enforced by the kronecker @xmath85-function @xmath86 .",
    "the third term describes the exchange interaction correction of the exciting laser by the electron - hole attraction , thus it can be seen as a local field correction of the time dependent bare rabi frequency @xmath87 .",
    "the last term describes the spin flip and flop of electrons .",
    "it is noticed that if @xmath88 , there is _ no _ spin flip and flop .",

    "we first show in fig .",
    "1 the electron and hole distribution functions @xmath160 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath161 versus @xmath162 and electron energy @xmath163 ( for electron distributions ) or hh energy @xmath164 ( for hole distribution ) for @xmath165  t. in the initial time one observes a small peak around 10  mev for @xmath166 in fig .",
    "this peak is the effect of the pump pulse and the strong hartree correction eq .",
    "the similar peak can also be observed for the hh distribution function in fig .",
    "at later times the carriers relax to the low energy states and @xmath166 reaches its first highest peak at 1.4  ps .",
    "around 7  ps , the distribution function of spin - up band reaches the valley of zero values and the spin - down band , in the mean time , arrives at its peak .",
    "this indicates that electrons in the spin - up band evolve into the spin - down band .",
    "after that electrons start to move back to the spin - up band and at about 14  ps @xmath166 reaches its second highest peak and @xmath167 reaches its valley .",
    "the reason that the second highest peak is a little higher than the first one is because there are more electrons at higher energy states at initial times due to the position of the pump pulse . this oscillation keeps on without any decay .",
    "the distribution for hh relaxes into the fermi - like distribution after a few picoseconds and remains unchanged . in fig .  2 the absolute value of the optical coherence , @xmath168 , and the absolute value of the spin coherence , @xmath169 ,",
    "are plotted as functions of @xmath162 and electron energy .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "2(a ) that the optical coherence decays very quickly and within first few picoseconds it has already totally disappeared .",
    "nevertheless , the spin coherence does not decay at all .",
    "the second peak is of the same height as the first one .",
    "the incoherently summed polarization , @xmath170 , and the incoherently summed spin coherence , @xmath139 , are plotted as dashed curves in fig .",
    "the total densities of each spin band @xmath171 for electron and @xmath172 for hh are also plotted as solid curves in the same figure .",
    "it is seen from the figure that the optical coherence injected by the pump pulse is about 3 times larger than the spin coherence .",
    "however , this coherence is strongly dephased by the coulomb scattering and is totally gone within the first few picoseconds .",
    "it is further shown from the figure that the spin coherence exhibits beating which does not decay at all .",
    "the electron densities of spin - up and down bands oscillate between zero and the total excitation .",
    "these results confirm that pure coulomb scattering does not contribute to the spin dephasing .",
    "we further find that the frequency of the oscillation is mainly determined by the zeeman split @xmath173 , but red - shifted by the hartree - fock terms in eq .",
    "( [ rhocoh ] ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath144-factor resulting from the oscillation frequency is 1.25 .",
    "it is interesting to see from the figure that the maximum value of @xmath174 occurs when the ( incoherently summed ) spin coherence is zero .",
    "the forbidden optical coherence is about 30 times smaller than the optical coherence and decays similarly as the optical coherence .",
    "it plays an insignificant role in this problem .",
    "now we include the contribution of ehse [ eqs .",
    "( [ rhoehse ] ) and ( [ rhoehse1 ] ) ] . as",
    "said before that the contribution from `` exchange '' ehse is negligible , we therefore only include the `` direct '' one [ eq .  ( [ rhoehse ] ) ] here .",
    "we are lacking information of the matrix elements @xmath55 which requires a detailed band structure calculation .",
    "for the sake of simplicity and also for comparison with the effect of coulomb scattering , in this study we assume it is the same as @xmath175 but with a phenomenological prefactor @xmath176 .",
    "we take @xmath177 so that in the scattering term , eq .  ( [ rhoehse ] ) , the matrix element of ehse is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the coulomb scattering .",
    "this number is taken so that the spin dephasing time is in agreement with the experiment.@xcite we have also performed numerical calculation by taking only the `` exchange '' ehse and found in order to get the same spin dephasing , the prefactor has to be 0.1 which is one order of magnitude larger than the present case .",
    "this big prefactor is understood due to the effect of the limitation of the energy phase space discussed before .",
    "-1.cm -2.cm -0.5 cm    the electron distribution functions @xmath160 ( @xmath24 ) versus @xmath162 and electron energy @xmath163 are plotted in fig .",

    "a similar peak can also be observed for the hh distribution function as in fig .",
    "again one observes that the carriers relax at later times to the low energy states and all the distributions show the fermi - like distributions .",
    "differing from the case with only coulomb scattering , there are only small oscillations of electrons between spin 1/2 and @xmath36 bands in the later time .",
    "the hh distribution remains unchanged after the first few picoseconds as before .",
    "the absolute value of optical coherence , @xmath178 , versus @xmath162 and electron energy is also unchanged from fig .",
    "2(a ) after inclusion of ehse",
    ". therefore , as before , the optical coherence decays very quickly and within a few picoseconds it has totally disappeared",
    ". however , ehse makes big change to the absolute value of the spin coherence as can be seen in fig .  5 where @xmath169 is plotted as a function of @xmath162 and electron energy .",
    "it is seen that the spin coherence lasts much longer and one can see a smaller second peak around 10.5  ps and a much smaller third peak around 18.4  ps",
    ". comparing with fig .",
    "2(b ) , one can see the effect of strong spin - dephasing by ehse as the second peak is much lower than the first one . for @xmath179",
    "ps , the spin coherence has almost gone .",
    "one more point needs to be addressed here is , one can see from fig .",
    "5 that there is a very small bump around 10  mev at initial time .",
    "a similar bump can also be seen in fig .",
    "these bumps are the effects of the pump pulse described before after eq .",
    "( [ rhocoh ] ) .",
    "one can see that they are much smaller compared to the effects caused by the magnetic field .",
    "this also justifies the assumption we made before that hh - hh spin coherence can be neglected in this investigation .",
    "-1.cm -0.5 cm    the incoherently summed polarization , @xmath170 , and the incoherently summed spin coherence , @xmath139 ,",
    "are plotted as dashed curves in fig .",
    "6 . in order to have the effect of spin coherence",
    "more pronounced , we plot in the same figure also @xmath180 as dash - dotted curve .",
    "the total densities of each spin band @xmath181 and @xmath182 are also plotted as solid curves in fig .",
    "it is seen from the figure that the optical coherence injected by the pump pulse is about 4.5 times larger than the spin coherence . however , this coherence is strongly destroyed by the coulomb scattering within the first few picoseconds .",
    "this is part of the reason of the fast decay in the fr angle for the first few picoseconds in the experiment.@xcite as seen in eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) , the fr angle is proportional to the `` total '' optical transitions . for the first few picoseconds ,",
    "the optical transitions are induced by both the pump pulse and the much weaker probe pulse , and the fast decay of the initial pump pulse - induced optical transition gives rise to the strong decay of the fr angle .",
    "it is further shown from the figure that the electron densities of spin up and down bands oscillate with the amplitude of the oscillation decaying .",
    "the circularly polarized pump pulse first pumps electrons into the spin - up cb from the spin - up hh band .",
    "therefore electrons first occupy the spin - up cb band and leave behind hhs in the spin - up vb .",
    "therefore @xmath183 and @xmath184 fast rise to @xmath185  @xmath149 within the time scale of the pump pulse . then due to the magnetic field , electrons in the spin - up band start to go to the spin - down band .",
    "this makes @xmath186 decreases and @xmath187 rises . in the mean time",
    ", the unbalance in populations also serves as pump field to the spin coherence .",
    "after @xmath162 is around 5  ps , the electron population in the spin - down band surpasses that in the spin - up band . without dephasing , this oscillation may keep going on as shown in the previous section .",
    "however , the spin dephasing makes these two populations finally merge . from the figure",
    ", one can see that for @xmath179  ps , the difference is already negligible compared to the oscillations before and @xmath188 also decays to zero .",
    "this oscillation is also shown in the experiment through the fr angle as beatings for the same magnetic field.@xcite all these results confirm what we proposed in sec .",
    "ii , that the spin dephasing is caused by ehse and the electron spin coherence is represented by @xmath188 .",
    "moreover , one also finds that besides the effect of spin dephasing , ehse also changes the oscillation frequency and hence the beating frequency of the fr angle . by comparing the period of the oscillations in figs .  3 and 6",
    ", one finds the period increases by about 1.34  ps in the later case .",
    "this means that the ehse further red - shifts the spin splitting .",
    "therefore , the @xmath144 factor reported in the experiment@xcite by measuring the frequency of the beating of the fr angle is the _ effective _ @xmath144 factor .",
    "it is seen from the figure that the period of the oscillation is @xmath189  ps .",
    "as @xmath190 , the effective @xmath144-factor @xmath191 is therefore 1.14 , in agreement with the what reported in the experiment as 1.1.@xcite again from the figure one observes that the maximum value of @xmath174 occurs when the ( incoherently summed ) spin coherence is zero .",
    "our calculation shows again that the forbidden optical coherence is insignificant in this problem .    in order to compare with @xmath192  t case , we plot in fig .",
    "7 the incoherently summed polarization @xmath170 and spin coherence @xmath139 as function of time @xmath162 , together with the total densities of each spin band @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "one finds the spin coherence decays at the same rate as in the @xmath165  t case but without any beating .",
    "so does the electrons in the spin bands .",
    "this confirms the finding in the experiment that there is no beating in the faraday rotation angle.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have performed theoretical studies of the kinetics of the spin coherence of optically excited electrons in an undoped insulating znse / zn@xmath0cd@xmath1se quantum well under moderate magnetic fields in the voigt configuration .",
    "based on a two spin - band model in both the cb and the vb , we build the kinetic equations combined with intra- and interband coulomb scattering and interband ehse in the boltzmann limit .",
    "we include all the coherences induced directly by the laser pulse optical transitions and indirectly through the effect of the magnetic field electron - electron spin coherence and forbidden optical coherence for the electron and hh in our model . the hh - hh spin coherence @xmath193 is neglected in our present investigation because it can not be induced by the effect of the magnetic field , but only through the pump pulse coupled to the forbidden transitions and is therefore much smaller than the other coherences .",
    "we separate the spin coherence from the well known optical coherences and study the effects of coulomb scattering and ehse on all the coherences .",
    "we find that the coulomb scattering makes strong dephasing of the optical coherence and forbidden optical coherence .",
    "however , it does not contribute to the spin dephasing at all .",
    "ehse is the main mechanism leads to the spin decoherence .",
    "we numerically solve the kinetic equations for two different magnetic fields .",
    "we find that the beating in the faraday rotation angle is basically determined by the electron zeeman splitting @xmath173 , however , with a red shift from the coulomb hartree - fock contribution and ehse effect .",
    "the forbidden optical coherence is found of marginal importance in this problem .",
    "the matrix element of the coulomb scattering is taken as statically screened coulomb potential and the matrix element of ehse is assumed the same as the coulomb scattering with a phenomenological prefactor . by fitting this prefactor with the dephasing time in the experiment,@xcite our theory can well explain the experiment data for two different magnetic fields .",
    "a first principal investigation of the ehse scattering matrix element is definitely important for a more thorough understanding of the spin dephasing.@xcite    for the @xmath2-doped material , things are quite different from the undoped case discussed in this paper . due to the presence of large numbers of doped electrons ( about one order of magnitude larger than the optically excited carriers ) in the cb",
    ", the lifetime of holes is therefore quite short and is measured smaller than 50  ps compared to the lower limit of 100  ps for the insulating sample.@xcite the experiments found that the spin dephasing for the doped sample is three orders of magnitude longer than the undoped sample , but with a fast dephasing ( losing about 50% coherence ) within the first 50  ps .",
    "the fast dephasing in the initial times can be well understood by the ehse discussed above , but modified with the fast decreasing of hh population .",
    "nevertheless , the mechanism of the spin dephasing discussed above can not be applied to the doped case after 50  ps as shown from eq .",
    "( [ rhoehse ] ) that the scattering of ehse is proportional to the hole distribution and therefore its contribution to the spin dephasing decreases with the recombination of electron and hole .",
    "however , for the @xmath2-doped case , it is also possible for ehse to contribute to the spin dephasing .",
    "as the timescale of the spin dephasing for the @xmath2-doped sample is much longer than the insulating sample , the coupling between the hh and the light hole can not be neglected and the spin of hh also experiences the precession.@xcite therefore , the hh - hh spin coherence @xmath194 , which is insignificant for the undoped case , may play an important role in the doped sample .",
    "its contribution to the scattering term to the electron spin coherence is in the similar form as eq .",
    "( [ rhoehse ] ) but all the hole distribution parts are replaced by terms composed of hh - hh spin coherences . in the absence of the hole distribution",
    ", it becomes the leading mechanism from the contribution of ehse to the spin dephasing .",
    "physically this contribution is the spin exchange between electrons and virtual holes .",
    "this mechanism , together with other spin dephasing mechanisms due to the band mixing for the @xmath2-doped case,@xcite is still under investigation .",
    "a corresponding extension of the present theory for the @xmath2-doped material will be published in a separate paper .",
