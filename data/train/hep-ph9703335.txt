    "<S> we study the impact of the four - quark dipenguin operator to the @xmath0 mixing . it is shown to contribute to the short distance piece at the same order of magnitude as the box diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon of meson mixing has been studied for a long time . </S>",
    "<S> observed in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems , it provides an extremely sensitive test of the standard model ( sm ) and essential for the cp violation in the neutral meson system .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that because of the gim cancellation mechanism and large mass of the top quark the short distance box diagram dominates in @xmath2 system and constitutes a significant fraction of the @xmath1 mixing amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the case of @xmath3 system is somewhat special : the @xmath4-quark contribution to the fermion loop of the box diagram providing @xmath5 transition is diminished by a tiny @xmath6 @xmath7 matrix element . </S>",
    "<S> thus , only the light quark mass difference guarantees that mixing does take place . </S>",
    "<S> the effect vanishes in the limit of the su(3 ) invariance . </S>",
    "<S> all of that results in the estimated value for @xmath8 being of the order of @xmath9 if only short distance contributions are taken into account @xcite , @xcite .    calculating a box diagram and constructing the effective hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> one realizes that the smallness of the short distance piece is guaranteed by a factor of @xmath10 @xcite :    @xmath11    with @xmath12 . here </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath4-quark contribution is dropped . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the following expression for the @xmath13 @xcite,@xcite @xmath14 ^ 4 \\bigl[\\frac{f_d}{f_\\pi } \\bigr]^2\\ ] ] with @xmath15 mev , @xmath16 mev , and @xmath17 in the usual vacuum saturation approximation to @xmath18 in contrast to the k - meson mixing , the appearance of the second operator can be traced to the fact that mass of the external @xmath19-quark provides a large momentum scale . as one can see from the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3.7 ) of @xcite , the inclusion of the @xmath4-quark further decreases the box diagram contribution .    in this note we would like to address an additional contribution to the short - distance d - meson mixing amplitude which is topologically distinct from the box diagram - the so - called double penguin or `` dipenguin '' operator . </S>",
    "<S> this operator was initially introduced in @xcite for @xmath1 mixing amplitude and has been subsequently studied in @xcite in application to @xmath1 as well as to @xmath2 systems . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown to be marginally important in the former and completely negligible in the latter case . here </S>",
    "<S> we will introduce the dipenguin operator for the @xmath5 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> it will be shown that this operator contributes to the @xmath20-meson mass difference at the same order of magnitude as the usual box diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective operator relevant to dipenguin @xmath5 transition can be obtained from the usual @xmath21 penguin vertex ( we neglect a tiny dipole contribution ) :    @xmath22    here @xmath23 is a modified inami - lim function @xcite . using unitarity of the ckm matrix it reads @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> it is common to discard @xmath4-quark contribution to @xmath23 as being suppressed by small @xmath6 factors . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that by keeping it we _ enhance _ the @xmath23 by approximately @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> also , for the intermediate @xmath4-quark this vertex ( as well as the following hamiltonian ) is _ </S>",
    "<S> local_. from ( [ vertex ] ) we obtain the following effective hamiltonian @xmath26 in what follows , we denote two operators entering ( [ dp ] ) as @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in order to study the size of the dipenguin effects in charm mixing we derive an estimate of the @xmath8 and compare with the usual box diagram contribution . to do that , in addition to the usual vacuum saturation approximation , we use pqcd in order to independently estimate the @xmath29 by simply calculating the transition amplitude from feynman diagram that determines the effect ( fig.1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that pqcd can provide a reliable order - of - magnitude estimate of the dipenguin contribution since the momentum transferred through the gluon line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a is relatively large , @xmath30 .    using the equations of motion and neglecting the up quark mass </S>",
    "<S> we obtain for the first operator in ( [ dp ] )    @xmath31    before we compare the estimate of the @xmath29 with the relevant box diagram contribution we would like to note that the dipenguin diagram does not have a power dependence upon the internal quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> the leading behavior of the inami - lim function is logarithmic in @xmath32 , and the estimate of the operator brings about power dependence upon the _ external _ quark masses , i.e. @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature distiguishes this contribution from that of the usual box diagram . </S>",
    "<S> recalling the fact that the dominant contribution to @xmath34 and @xmath35 mixing amplitudes is proportional to the square of the top quark mass , it is not surprising that this effect is negligible in the k and b sectors . </S>",
    "<S> it is the fact of the `` reduced '' heavy quark dependence of the amplitude of @xmath3 mixing which makes the dipenguin operator contribution effectively enhanced .    employing vacuum saturation method to estimate matrix elements we obtain    @xmath36    with @xmath35 and @xmath37 being the bag parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the vacuum saturation we assumed that each derivative acting on the quark field involves an average momentum of the quark . </S>",
    "<S> this yields    @xmath38    this formula deserves some additional discussion . in the case of @xmath0 mixing the chief effect comes from the light quark sector . </S>",
    "<S> this is true for both the box and dipenguin diagrams , and makes the calculation a little more involved - one can not simply discard the external quark momenta ( masses ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is why one must use a modified expression for the inami - lim function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the leading contribution to @xmath39 comes from the integral @xmath40 = -4 \\bigl [ \\frac{1}{6 } \\ln \\frac{m_i^2}{m_w^2 } + \\pi \\bigl(\\frac{q^2}{m_i^2 } \\bigr ) \\bigr]\\ ] ] where @xmath41 was defined in @xcite for @xmath42 . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , of course , @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the necessity of the second term becomes obvious if one looks at the chiral limit , wherein the first logarithm in ( [ il ] ) blows up . </S>",
    "<S> the final result for @xmath23 involves a delicate cancellation among these contributions , yielding a final result @xmath44 ( whereas @xmath45 if the momentum flow is discarded ) . comparing ( [ msd ] ) and ( [ mdp ] ) we find @xmath46 where we have put @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative size of the box and dipenguin contribution shows that the latter is of the same order of magnitude as the box diagram ( our estimate gives @xmath49 depending on the choice of quark masses ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising if one recalls that higher order qcd corrections tend to `` smooth out '' a power - like gim suppression , just as in the case of @xmath35-meson decays . </S>",
    "<S> this is not so relevant in the bottom ( or strange ) meson sector since a large mass of the top quark actually converts gim - suppression to `` gim - enhancement '' , thus making higher order corrections relatively unimportant .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting observation is the fact that the dipenguin diagram actually contributes to the @xmath8 with a sign _ opposite _ to the box diagram ( compare ( [ msd ] ) and ( [ mdp ] ) ) ! </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the short - distance piece is even smaller than was claimed in previous estimates based solely on the box diagram contribution . </S>",
    "<S> note that this operator gives rise to a whole family of the diagrams ( e.g. fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) that by no means can be calculated in perturbative qcd but might be potentially important for @xmath0 mixing .    </S>",
    "<S> it must be stressed that @xmath3 mixing is not dominated by the short distance box diagram contribution @xcite but rather by long distance pieces @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been estimated in @xcite using dispersive techniques for a class of two - body pseudoscalar intermediate states and was shown to boost the value of @xmath8 to @xmath50 gev . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is not excluded that additional contributions could conspire in a way that they cancel the two body piece @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have estimated the contribution of the dipenguin diagram to the short - distance amplitude for @xmath0 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown to contribute at the same order of magnitude as the box diagram .    </S>",
