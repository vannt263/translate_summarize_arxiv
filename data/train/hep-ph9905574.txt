    "large rapidity gap ( lrg ) cuts , used in some analyses of diffractive dis at hera to select diffractive events , restrict the kinematically accessible phase space for a significant range of the kinematic parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2@xcite .",
    "one consequence of this is a systematic reduction in the diffractive structure function .",
    "further , since lrg cuts provide a stronger constraint on diffractive dijet production than on higher - multiplicity diffractive final states , these cuts are expected to lead to a relative enhancement in the contribution from @xmath3 and higher - order diffractive final states .",
    "the sensitivity of the phase space constraints to @xmath2 also means that one can not extract a well - defined pomeron structure function from lrg data for which phase space effects are expected .    in the next section",
    "we briefly discuss the relevant kinematics and hadronization effects . in section[sect :",
    "consequences ] we explain the relationship between pseudo - rapidity cuts and phase space constraints in diffractive dis , and describe the region of hera parameter space in which such effects might be observed . following this , we explore the consequences of lrg cuts on the extraction of diffractive and pomeron structure functions , and constraints on @xmath3 and higher - order diffractive final states .",
    "we use the usual variables of dis and diffractive dis , where pseudo - rapidity , @xmath4 , is defined by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the hera lab angle between the forward proton direction and any significant hadronic activity from the diffractive final state .",
    "another interesting kinematic variable is the transverse momentum , @xmath7 , of final - state partons in the virtual photon - pomeron centre - of - momentum ( cms ) system . for dijet final states ,",
    "this is given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the cms scattering angle between the final state parton in the diffractive system which couples to the same vertex as the pomeron , and the @xmath10 axis .",
    "a similar relation can easily be constructed for higher - order diffractive final states .    in order to relate pseudo - rapidity cuts ,",
    "which are made at hadron level in the hera lab frame , to @xmath7 , defined above at parton level in the @xmath10 cms system , one must first make some assumption about hadronization effects , and also calculate the boost between the lab and cms systems .",
    "we assume that the final - state partons hadronize into a jet with a radius of half a unit of pseudo - rapidity .",
    "thus , for example , a pseudo - rapidity cut , @xmath11 , of 3.2 made at hadron level corresponds to a pseudo - rapidity interval of about 2.7 at parton level .",
    "one can express the final - state phase space for diffractive dis in terms of the transverse momentum variable , @xmath7 , defined in the previous section . to calculate the diffractive structure function , one integrates over the full range of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the large pseudo - rapidity gap cuts imposed in some analyses of diffractive dis at hera restrict the kinematically accessible range of @xmath7 .    to see this",
    ", one calculates the boost that relates angles in the hera lab and @xmath10 cms systems in terms of the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the proton and electron initial energies ( see@xcite for details ) .",
    "since pseudo - rapidity is related to the lab scattering angle , and @xmath7 to the cms scattering angle , we have the result for a pseudo - rapidity cut @xmath12 :    @xmath13    in figs.[fig : etacut18 ] and[fig : etacut32 ] , we show the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for dijet production for a very strong pseudo - rapidity cut of @xmath15 , corresponding to early h1 analyses@xcite , and for the much weaker cut of @xmath16 which has been used in recent analyses@xcite .",
    "it is important to note that for a large range of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one finds that @xmath17 , that is , there is no strong constraint .",
    "however , even for the weaker cut , we see that @xmath14 can be significant at large @xmath2 , and at small @xmath1 .",
    "the diffractive structure function can be expressed as an integral over the diffractive scattering cross section via    @xmath18    from eq.[eq : f2d3lrg ] , it is clear that for cuts which constrain @xmath14 to be greater than a few gev@xmath19 , we are not extracting the full diffractive structure function from the data . in particular , since @xmath14 varies with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , there is a systematic decrease in the extracted @xmath20 compared to that which would be extracted using techniques which do not impose such constraints .",
    "we have also calculated the constraints for production of @xmath3 and higher - order diffractive final states , and find a weaker constraint applies :    @xmath21    hence , in regions where @xmath22 is significant , one would expect to find a relative enhancement in the contribution to the diffractive structure function from the rapidity gap data from multi - jet final states over that in the full diffractive structure function , since    @xmath23      in the ingelman - schlein model of diffractive dis@xcite , one assumes the pomeron to behave somewhat like an hadronic state , and expects the diffractive structure function to factorize into the product of an @xmath2-dependent pomeron flux factor , @xmath24 , and an @xmath2-independent `` pomeron structure function '' , @xmath25 , via    @xmath26    however , from eq.[eq : f2d3lrg ] , we see that the lrg diffractive structure function depends on @xmath14 .",
    "hence , since @xmath14 is a rather sensitive function of @xmath2 , even though the full diffractive structure function might factorize , @xmath20 extracted from lrg data for which @xmath14 is significant is not expected to factorize due to the additional @xmath2 dependence introduced through the lower limit of the phase space integral .",
    "this breakdown of @xmath2-factorization through data selection cuts means that one can not extract a well - defined @xmath2-independent pomeron structure function in the region of parameter space in which there are phase space restrictions due to lrg cuts .",
    "we have discussed the result@xcite that pseudo - rapidity cuts restrict the phase space available for diffractive deep - inelastic scattering for some range of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , by expressing the phase space constraints in terms of a restriction on the transverse momentum structure of the diffractive final state . for the weaker pseudo - rapidity cuts employed in recent h1 analyses@xcite",
    ", we still expect a reduction in the diffractive structure function extracted at large @xmath2 , and at low @xmath1 over that observed with other techniques such as leading proton detection .",
    "since the phase space constraints depend on @xmath2 , this effect will also lead to a breakdown of @xmath2-factorization in the extracted diffractive structure function .",
    "further , we find that the constraints on diffractive final states with three or more partons are rather weaker than on dijet production@xcite , and hence also predict that lrg cuts lead to a comparative enhancement of @xmath3 and higher - order events over dijet events .",
