    "aperiodic fluctuations are common in these systems , as first discovered by @xcite in the prototype bhc cyg  x-1 in its hard state with a large amplitude ( up to @xmath1 rms of the mean flux ) .",
    "many properties of x - ray rapid variability from cyg  x-1 , e.g. , the fourier power spectrum , the mean and variance , and the autocorrelation function of the lightcurve , could be described as the superposition of individual shots with the characteristic duration of a few tenths of a second @xcite .",
    "the average shot profiles of cyg  x-1 have been obtained by superposing many shots by aligning their peaks in the lightcurves obtained with _ ginga _ @xcite and _ rxte _ @xcite .",
    "studying the short timescale variability of the x - ray emission of accreting bhc or ns systems is important for understanding the emitting region and emission process of high energy photons , as well as the nature of the compact object .",
    "timing studies carried out in the time domain can make direct measurements of , e.g. , power , spectral lag , of a stochastic process at high frequencies ( short timescales ) .",
    "@xcite has developed a technique of timescale analysis , with which timescale spectra can be derived directly in the time domain .",
    "the timescale analysis of the correlation coefficient between intensity and hardness ratio of cyg  x-1 @xcite is consistent with the results from superposed shots @xcite .",
    "the time domain power density at a certain timescale can be defined as the differential of the variation power in a lightcurve with the corresponding time step @xcite .",
    "the timescale spectra of power density of a sample of ns and bhc binaries were analyzed and the results indicate that the characteristic timescale of hard x - ray shots is @xmath2  s for bhcs , and much shorter ( @xmath3  ms ) for nss @xcite .    in the present work , we propose a statistic @xmath0 , the differential coefficient of the mean absolute difference of an observed lightcurve , to make timescale analysis of shot width .",
    "the timescale spectrum of @xmath0 can reflect the width distribution of a stochastic shot process with noise .",
    "we introduce the method of @xmath0 analysis in  2 .",
    "we studied the @xmath0 spectra of a sample of ns and bhc binaries and made an energy dependent analysis of the shot widths for three bhc binaries with rxte / pca data ; the results are presented in  3 . in ",
    "4 we discuss the possible implications of our results .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the originally observed lightcurve , where @xmath5 ( cts / s ) is the counting rate during the time interval @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 is the time resolution . to study the variability on a larger timescale @xmath9 , we need to construct a lightcurve with the time step @xmath10 from the original time series by combining its _ m _ successive bins as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 $ ] ) is the discrete phase of the time series . as the lightcurve @xmath15 does not include any information about the variation on timescales shorter than @xmath10 , it can be used to study the variability over the region of timescales @xmath16 .",
    "a mean absolute difference of the observed lightcurve at the timescale @xmath10 can be defined as @xmath17 the quantity @xmath18 includes information of variability with timescales larger than or equal to @xmath10 . to extract the information at the timescale @xmath10",
    ", we can calculate the rate of change of @xmath18 @xmath19    to detect the signal in a spectrum @xmath20 against a noise background , we need to know the timescale spectrum @xmath21 of a time series consisting of only noise .",
    "we assume two independent random variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 follow the poisson distribution with the same mean @xmath24 ( cts ) , then the expectation of their absolute difference value is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the modified bessel function of the first kind with the order number @xmath27 .",
    "therefore the mean absolute difference for the background can be derived as @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the average counting rate of the lightcurve , then @xmath30 finally the signal s value of the statistic @xmath0 can be derived as @xmath31    calculating @xmath32 by eq .",
    "( [ ws ] ) at different step @xmath10 for an observed lightcurve we can get a timescale spectrum of @xmath33 . the differential coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ w ] ) and ( [ wn ] ) can be calculated numerically . in practice",
    ", a lightcurve may be divided into @xmath34 segments , we can calculate @xmath35 for each segment and then obtain the average value @xmath36 and its standard error @xmath37      we make simulation study in order to understand the timescale spectra of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 spectra of two time series consisting of square shots are calculated .",
    "the shot width is 0.1  s. one time series ( top panel of [ pr ] ) consists of periodic shots with a period of 1  s , and in the other time series ( middle panel of [ pr ] ) shots are randomly distributed with shot separations following an exponential distribution with a mean of 1  s. the time resolution is 5  ms and the total time length is 1250s with each segment of 250  s. a peak around the timescale 0.1  s appears clearly in each spectrum ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "the other characteristic timescale of the periodic series , 0.5  s , is also shown in its @xmath0 spectrum ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ pr ] ) with a smaller amplitude . at small timescales",
    ", the random shot series has stronger variability than the periodic one , indicated by the larger amplitude in the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "the @xmath33 spectra of a set of simulated lightcurves consisting of both white noise and signal shots randomly occurring with different widths and amplitudes are also calculated .",
    "the shot width is randomly sampled from a uniform distribution between @xmath38 $ ] and its profile has either square or gaussian form .",
    "the peak amplitude of a shot is drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1000  cts / s .",
    "the shot occurring time is randomly distributed following an exponential distribution with a mean of 1  s. the time resolution is 10  ms and the total duration is 5000  s with each segment of 500  s. a background of 1000  cts / s is added .",
    "poisson counting statistics are also included in the simulations .",
    "the results , shown in fig . [ shots ] ( panel ( a ) for square shots and ( b ) for gaussian shots ) , indicate that we can use the position of short timescale cut - off in the @xmath33 spectrum to measure the shortest width of random shots in an observed lightcurve with noise . for comparison , we also calculate the fourier power spectrum density ( psd ) for each shot series .",
    "the results are plotted in panel ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ shots ] for square and gaussian shots , respectively .",
    "it is clear by comparing the psd with the @xmath33 spectra in fig .",
    "[ shots ] that the @xmath0 spectrum can be used to detect the shot width more conveniently and accurately .",
    "to measure the lower cut - off in a @xmath33 spectrum , we fit a polynomial to the front edge and obtain the root value .",
    "the error of the cut - off timescale is evaluated from the fitting error with 90% confident level . in this way , the lower cut - off timescales for the above simulations are @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( s ) respectively for different lightcurves in the left panel of fig .  [ shots ] , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( s ) for the right panel of fig .",
    "[ shots ] .",
    "the measured lower cut - off timescale in the @xmath0 spectrum is very close to the input lower scale of shot widths , which are 0.05 , 0.075 and 0.1 ( s ) respectively for both square and gaussian shots .",
    "there are larger differences for gaussian shots because of the gaussian fwhm may not equal to @xmath0 spectrum s shot width .",
    "we therefore conclude that we can detect the lower cut - off timescale of x - ray shots from lightcurves with the @xmath0 spectrum .    to address the question whether @xmath0 spectrum may also detect the frequency breaks often seen in the psd of the lightcurves many astrophysical sources , we simulate two lightcurves with different psds ( using the inverse fft method of * ? ? ?",
    "the psd consists of power - law forms at different segments : power - law index @xmath45 when @xmath46 hz , @xmath47 when @xmath48 and @xmath49 hz , and @xmath50 or @xmath51 when @xmath52 hz ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 spectra of these two lightcurves are presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ powerlaw ] .",
    "we can see that the frequency breaks in the psd do not correspond to timescale cut - offs , but manifest as different slopes in the @xmath0 spectra .    in sum",
    ", the @xmath0 spectrum is only sensitive to the width distribution of a shot series , but insensitive to other shot parameters , such as the shot profile , shot separation distribution and shot amplitude . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum is especially powerful in detecting the smallest shot width of a shot series .",
    "we apply the timescale analysis method to observations of a number of x - ray binaries with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte)_. the data are screened when five pcus are all on and the original time bin size @xmath8 of the lightcurve is binned to 2  ms or 4  ms according to the data mode , with each segment of 50000 bins ( 100  s or 200  s ) .",
    "because this analysis method can tolerate high level of noise , we did not avoid pca channels 0 - 7 , which have higher level of instrumental background .",
    "the observation ids and other details of used data are listed in table [ data ] .",

    "all spectra show a cut - off at a timescale about 0.05  s. but for five selected ns binaries with weak magnetic field , i.e. , 4u  1705 - 440 , gs  1826 - 24 , 4u  0614 + 091 , 4u  1608 - 522 , and cyg  x-2 , the @xmath33 spectra have no obvious cut - off above @xmath53  s ( see the bottom panel of fig .",

    "the energy dependent analysis is carried out for three bhc binaries : cyg  x-1 , xte  j1550 - 564 , and gro  j1655 - 40 .",
    "all sources are at their hard state .",
    "the choice of energy bands for each observation reflects the different data mode of each observation . from figure",
    "[ ec ] , one can see a common trend : below about 10 - 20 kev the cut - off timescale @xmath54 decreases with increasing energy , and above about 10 - 20 kev @xmath54 increases with increasing energy .",
    "an emission feature at iron k@xmath55 line appears clearly in the energy spectra of cyg  x-1 and xte  j1550 - 564 , and a broad peak around @xmath56 6  kev can also be seen in their @xmath54 spectra . for gro",
    "j1655 - 40 , the fe reflection component is very weak in the energy spectrum of this observation , and this broad peak in its @xmath54 spectra is also not seen .",
    "extracting physical information from lightcurves for multi - timescale and aperiodic processes is difficult .",
    "however , it is important to study the underlying physics in high - energy processes around compact objects .",
    "the timescale analysis technique has the freedom of selecting or designing a proper statistic for a particular purpose .",
    "our results of simulation and data analysis for accreting x - ray sources show that the proposed statistic @xmath0 is useful in timescale analysis of shot widths . from their @xmath0 spectra ( the top panel of fig .",
    "[ bhns ] ) , we find that the bhcs have shortest shot width @xmath56 0.05  s , consistent with that shots in bhcs have characteristic timescale @xmath56 0.1  s , which was previously derived by a timescale analysis of power density @xcite .",
    "the fact that no short timescale cut - off appears in the @xmath0 spectra of ns binaries ( the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ bhns ] ) is also consistent with what indicated by their timescale spectra of power density @xcite , and by fourier spectral analysis @xcite of these systems in the hard state .",
    "the timescale analysis technique of shot width proposed in this work , like the time domain power spectrum analysis , can help us distinguish bhcs from nss . compared with the timescale analysis of power density spectrum ,",
    "the statistic @xmath0 can measure more directly and sensitively the lower cut - off of shot timescale , with which we can study the energy dependence of the cut - off timescale quantitatively .",
    "the variation timescale is usually taken as an indicator of the spatial dimensions of the underlying physical process .",
    "the remarkable result from our timescale analysis with the statistic @xmath0 is the energy dependent timescale cut - off of bhcs ( fig .",
    "[ ec ] ) is hard to explain by a simple correspondence between the variation timescale and the radius where shots take place .",
    "the monotonic increase of the timescale cut - off with energy in the region of @xmath57 - 20  kev is consistent with previous time domain analysis of variability in cyg  x-1 and other bhcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is expected from the common understanding that hard x - rays come from inverse compton scattering of low - energy seed photons by high - energy electrons in a hot corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or hot advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where a shot of low energy seed photons are hardened and broadened by the comptonization process .",
    "a rough estimate from figure [ ec ] can be made to evaluate the corona size @xmath58 of a bhc .",
    "we assume a typical temperature of @xmath56100 kev for the hot corona at the hard spectral state .",
    "the mean free path of x - rays in corona can be considered as the corona s spatial dimension @xmath58 , because its optical depth is @xmath59 1 from the energy spectral fitting .",
    "we assume the turning point energy @xmath60 at @xmath0 spectrum as the energy of input seed shot photons , and after @xmath61 times of inverse compton scattering , the mean photon energy is increased to @xmath62 , the timescale @xmath63 of shots at energy @xmath62 can then be located in the @xmath54 spectrum . by a simple relationship of @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the turning point timescale in the @xmath54 spectrum and @xmath66 is the light speed , @xmath58 is then estimated . from figure",
    "[ ec ] , the approximately derived @xmath58 are in order of 30 , 140 and 70 @xmath67 ( schwarzschild radius ) for cyg  x-1 , xte  j1550 - 564 and gro  j1655 - 40 , respectively , assuming these bhc masses are 10 , 10 and 7 @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the general trend of timescale cut - off vs. energy in the energy region of @xmath69 - 20  kev is opposite to that in higher energy region .",
    "we first ignore the broad peak around 6 kev in the @xmath54 spectrum and focus on the decreasing trend of @xmath54 with increasing energy at @xmath70 - 20  kev .",
    "one probability is that shots of different energies are produced in different regions of the disk : the high energy shots are located at inner disk and low energy ones are from outer region .",
    "the turning point at @xmath56  10 - 20  kev may indicate that the maximum energy of the initial shot photons , which are most probably produced at the turbulent region of the cold disk joining the hot corona , can be as high as up to @xmath56 10 - 20  kev @xcite .",
    "another possibility to explain the @xmath54 spectrum at energy below the turning point is to consider the shots with energies below the turning point are produced by down - comptonization , i.e. , original shots with energy at the turning point are scattered by cold electron cloud covering the accretion disk @xcite . from the top panel of figure [ ec ] ( cyg  x-1 )",
    ", we can see that from 11.6 kev ( the turning point energy ) to 2.4 kev ( the lowest energy ) the timescale is increased by 0.037 s. if the mean kinetic energy of cold electrons is much less than the turning point energy , about 170 times of scattering are needed for the x - ray energy increased from the turning point energy to 2.4 kev .",
    "assuming the relationship between the increase of timescale @xmath10 , the number of scattering @xmath71 and mean free path @xmath72 under the optically thick condition , is described by @xmath73 , the derived mean free path @xmath72 is @xmath74 cm ( 2.2 @xmath67 of cyg  x-1 ) .    under the above assumption that an optically thick cold electron cloud covers the initial shots ( with energy at the turning point of the @xmath54 spectrum ) located near the innermost region of the disk , we can evaluate the geometry of the cold electron cloud , from the shape of the the @xmath54 spectrum ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ ec ] for cyg  x-1 ) .",
    "the distance between the location where the down - scattered photons escape to the seed shot photon region can be described as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the optical depth and equal to @xmath77 in an optically thick system .",
    "we find that @xmath76 increases and @xmath72 decreases when the photon energy decreases , and consequently @xmath78 of @xmath79 is obtained , almost independent of the escaped photon energy .",
    "similarly we also applied the above procedure to the data on xte  j1550 - 564 and gro  j1655 - 40 . in figure [ ed ] we show the relationship between @xmath79 and the escaped photon energy .",
    "our calculation for cyg  x-1 also indicates that if the mean temperature of electrons is larger than 0.03 kev , the above down - comptonization process can not decrease the average photon energy from the turning point to below 2.4 kev .",
    "for example , if the electron temperature is 0.03 kev , after about 1000 compton scattering the average photon energy saturates at 2.4 kev , down from the seed shot photon energy of 11.6 kev .",
    "so if the above assumed down - comptonization scenario is true for the @xmath54 spectrum below the turning point , we predict that a sharp increase of timescale in the @xmath54 spectrum below the saturation energy , which is uniquely related to the temperature of the cold electron cloud .    finally we examine the broad peak in the @xmath54 spectrum around @xmath56 6 kev for cyg  x-1 and xte  j1550 - 564 .",
    "it is most probably produced by the disk reflection component : reprocessed iron k@xmath55 fluorescent photons in the cold disk irradiated by hard x - rays with energy above the @xmath567kev iron k - edge will further broaden the shots .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with the explanation of time delays and the behavior of the iron line @xcite with frequency - resolved energy spectra @xcite .",
    "besides producing the fluorescence iron k@xmath55 emission , the refection also has a strong component at energies above 10 kev , which may contribute to the increase of shot width above the tuning point in addition to the up - comptonization process we discussed above .",
