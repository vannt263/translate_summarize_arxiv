    "the free energy of mono - domain ferromagnetic particles depends on the relative orientation of the magnetization with respect to the crystal lattice .",
    "this magnetic anisotropy results from the combination of coulomb repulsion favoring spin polarization , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , and the crystal field breaking the orbital rotation invariance . as a result ,",
    "the orbital moment of magnetic atoms and their magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) depend strongly on their atomic coordination @xcite .",
    "the transport counterpart of mae is anisotropic magneto - resistance ( amr ) , i.e. the dependence of the resistance on the angle @xmath0 between the magnetization and the current flow .",
    "whereas amr in bulk was known back in the xix century and is a rather small effect , the recent observation of amr in a variety of low dimensional systems @xcite , largely exceeding bulk values , has opened a new research venue in the field of spin - polarized quantum transport .",
    "very large amr has been reported in planar tunnel junctions ( tamr ) with a variety of electrode and barrier materials @xcite . enhanced amr",
    "has also been observed in atomic sized contacts , both in the tunnel regime ( tamr ) and in the contact ( or ballistic@xcite ) regime ( bamr)@xcite , for py @xcite , fe @xcite , ni @xcite , and co @xcite .",
    "additionally , gamnas islands in the coulomb blockade regime show electrically tunable amr ( cb - amr ) @xcite .",
    "thus , a wide range of nanostructures made from different materials display enhanced amr .",
    "here we focus on amr in atomic - size conductors for several reasons .",
    "on the one hand , conductance of atomic - sized contacts probes the electronic structure of the apex atoms .",
    "these have coordination different from bulk and thus present different orbital and spin magnetic moment @xcite , and enhanced magnetic anisotropy @xcite which might be probed by bamr . on the other hand , nanocontacts allow to study amr going from the contact ( bamr ) to the tunnel ( tamr ) regime in the same system , as shown in the case of both ni and py @xcite .",
    "ni nanocontacts have also been used as electrodes to explore the coulomb blockade and the kondo regimes @xcite .",
    "the crux of the matter is to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions to expect large values of amr in quantum transport .",
    "here we consider two different transport regimes , coherent and sequential . in the coherent regime",
    "we use the landauer formalism that , at zero temperature , relates the zero - bias conductance @xmath1 to the quantum mechanical transmission of the electrons at the fermi energy , @xmath2 .",
    "this approach accounts for amr both in the tunneling regime ( tamr)@xcite and in the contact or ballistic regime ( bamr)@xcite in the absence of sharp resonances near the fermi energy . in the scattering - free case of perfect 1d chains ,",
    "@xmath3 is simply given by the number of bands at the fermi energy @xmath4 . because of the soc , @xmath4 for ferromagnetic 1d transition metal chains @xcite depends on the angle @xmath0 between the chain axis and the magnetization , and this leads naturally to stepwise @xmath5 curves .",
    "however , the idealized scattering - free picture fails to account for the experimental results of conductance in metallic nanocontacts , for which scattering channels are not perfectly conducting @xcite . according to the scattering - free theory",
    ", the conductance of atomic contacts of ni , in units of @xmath6 , would be 6 or 7 for ni @xcite , in quantitative _ disagreement _ with the measured @xcite conductance of ni nanocontacts around @xmath7 .",
    "the same applies to fe , co and pt .",
    "scattering definitely affects @xmath8-bands , which suffer the so called _ orbital blocking _ @xcite .",
    "here we present calculations of bamr _ plus _ scattering .",
    "this approach also permits to calculate the crossover from bamr to tamr .",
    "we find that in the coherent regime large amr is related to the orbital polarization of the current .",
    "tamr has been linked to the anisotropy of the density of states at @xmath9 , which turns out to be large in ni chains .",
    "unexpectedly , this does not lead to a large value of tamr , the reason being that the current is not orbitally polarized in this limit .    in the sequential regime ,",
    "valid to describe systems that feature transport through resonant levels of width @xmath10 smaller than the temperature @xmath11@xcite , we find enhanced amr , regardless of the orbital polarization of the current , if the chemical potential @xmath9 of the ferromagnetic electrode crosses a resonance as it varies due to change of the magnetization angle .",
    "this situation occurs in a single electron transistor with ferromagnetic electrodes @xcite .",
    "resonances might also occur in the tip atoms of ni nanocontacts in the tunneling regime@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ sec : sequential ] we treat amr in the _ sequential _ tunneling regime . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we conclude the paper summarizing the main results .",
    "as a model system for ferromagnetic nanocontacts we consider two semi - infinite ni 1d chains with lattice parameter @xmath12 , separated by a gap @xmath13 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "this model shares most of the relevant features with realistic nanocontact models , like e.g. the low coordination of the tip atoms of the two electrodes and elastic electron scattering due to the gap . on the other hand the one - dimensionality and the resulting rotational invariance of our model",
    "simplify considerably the calculations of the soc and the interpretation of the results .",
    "such one - dimensional models have been employed before to study fundamental properties of atomic - size nanocontacts @xcite .     between two semi - infinite 1d ni chains with lattice spacing @xmath12 . ]",
    "we calculate the electronic structure of the system using a combination of density functional theory ( dft ) in the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and a green s function technique to account for the fact that , when @xmath14 , the system is not translationally invariant .",
    "we split the system into 3 regions , left ( l ) and right ( r ) electrodes , described as semi - infinite ni chains , and the central region ( c ) containing the 3 innermost atoms of each electrode , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the electronic structure of both the electrodes and the central region is described using effective one - body hamiltonians obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations , performed with crystal03@xcite on the lsda level , and using a localized atomic orbital minimal basis set .",
    "crystal03 , which does not include soc , yields spin - polarized solutions along an arbitrary axis with majority and minority electrons .",
    "the soc term @xmath15 is added to the converged self - consistent lsda hamiltonian @xmath16 : @xmath17 this post self - consistent approach @xcite is justified in the case of ni , for which the soc is much smaller than the exchange splittings and the bandwidths .",
    "we take @xmath18 for the ni @xmath19-orbitals .",
    "the green s function of the central region is obtained by means of the so - called _ partitioning _ technique : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total hamiltonian ( including soc ) of the c region , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are self - energies that take into account the coupling of the central region to the two electrodes @xcite .    in the coherent regime ,",
    "i.e. at low temperatures and small bias voltages when inelastic scattering events can be neglected , we use the landauer formalism to calculate the conductance of the system which is obtained from the transmission function .",
    "the transmission function in turn can be calculated by means of the caroli expression from the green s function of the central region , eq .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]      magnetic anisotropy comes from the combined action of both , the crystal field that breaks the orbital rotational invariance , and the atomic soc term , that couples the spin polarization to the orbital degrees of freedom . the electronic structure of the ideal one dimensional ni chain ( @xmath33 ) presents a number of common features with 3d and 4d transition metals@xcite and permits to understand transport results for @xmath14 .",
    "the bands close to the fermi energy are formed by @xmath34 and @xmath8 orbitals . in the absence of soc , rotational invariance around the chain axis permits to classify the @xmath8 orbitals according to the projection of their angular momentum along the chain direction , @xmath35 . on top of that , a weak crystal field splits the otherwise degenerate @xmath8 levels into two doublets @xmath36 ( linear combination of states with @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and a singlet @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , which is hybridized with the @xmath34 orbital .",
    "the orbital degeneracy of the doublets is kept by the bands of the chain , as long as soc is not present .",
    "the bandwidth of the @xmath38 is significantly smaller than that of @xmath36 due to the smaller overlap of the @xmath38 orbitals . as a result",
    ", the @xmath38 bands yield a higher density of states .",
    "the combined action of soc and magnetism alters this situation @xcite . when the magnetization is pointing perpendicular to the chain axis @xmath42 , soc acts as an effective magnetic field acting over @xmath43 that has to compete with the @xmath44-like terms arising from the crystal field , which happens to be dominant . as a result ,",
    "the bands for @xmath45 look very similar to those without soc , except in the points where bands with @xmath46 and @xmath47 intersect , which are far away from @xmath9 in the case of ni .",
    "therefore , for @xmath45 the effect of soc on transport is negligible .",
    "in contrast , when magnetization is pointing along the chain axis @xmath48 , soc shifts the bands by an amount @xmath49 , where @xmath35 and @xmath50 are the projection of the spin and orbital momentum along the chain . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath36 orbital doublets are split so that one of the 2 minority @xmath38 bands is shifted below the fermi energy , compared to the @xmath45 case .",
    "this can be seen in the stepwise curves in fig .",
    "2a , that correspond to @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the ideal chain . at the fermi energy , @xmath53 .",
    "this change is responsible for bamr@xcite , defined as bamr@xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "the interplay between soc and magnetization results in a non - zero orbital moment _ density _ along the magnetization direction .",
    "the largest orbital moment occurs when @xmath56 , i.e. when the magnetization is along the chain @xcite .",
    "the _ orbital _",
    "_ polarization current _ ( opc ) defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the transmission of the @xmath8-orbitals with @xmath59 or @xmath60 along the chain direction , vanishes when @xmath45 but is _ non - zero _ when @xmath56 .",
    "interestingly , there is a perfect one - to - one correspondence between the opc and the bamr in the case of the ideal chain without scattering .",
    "it is also apparent that the existence of an orbital magnetic moment is not a sufficient condition for having a non - zero opc , very much like spin - polarization does not necessarily imply a spin - polarized current @xcite .",
    "now we see how elastic scattering , controlled with the chain separation @xmath8 , affects bamr .",
    "the stretched bond mimics the contact region .",
    "this perturbation preserves the axial symmetry of the ideal chain but introduces scattering . as a consequence @xmath61 , shown in fig .",
    "2a , is not quantized anymore , as expected @xcite and yet the bamr ( fig .",
    "2c ) is close to that of the ideal case for values of @xmath62 .",
    "relatedly , the @xmath5 curve is not stepwise ( as is the case of the ideal chain ) anymore when scattering is included ( fig .",
    "2d ) . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath5 curve is also different from bulk behavior where @xmath63 .",
    "the quantized step in the ideal case ( @xmath33 ) that corresponds to the critical angle at which the @xmath38 band is pushed below the fermi energy @xcite , becomes progressively smoother as the gap between the chains increases .",
    "our @xmath5 curves including scattering agree with those of the experiments @xcite .",
    "this is one of the important results of the model .    as @xmath8 increases , the scattering increases and @xmath1 goes down but interestingly , the bamr signal first _ increases _",
    "slightly for @xmath64 before finally going down with increasing scattering .",
    "the initial increase in bamr is related to the initially stronger decrease of the contribution of the @xmath40-channel to the conductance .",
    "the @xmath40-channel is not affected by the soc in contrast to the @xmath38 channels that are mainly responsible for the bamr signal .",
    "the decrease of the bamr signal for larger values of @xmath8 is expected within the framework of our model , since the relative contribution to the conductance of the @xmath8-channels compared to the @xmath34-channel decreases as the gap opens .",
    "the reason for this is the shorter spread of the @xmath8-orbitals compared to the @xmath34-orbitals @xcite .",
    "relatedly , the opc ( fig .",
    "2c ) also decreases as @xmath8 increases .",
    "removing the contribution of the @xmath34-channel to the conductance would thus enhance bamr .",
    "this could be accomplished e.g. by oxidation of the contact @xcite .",
    "in this section we study the anisotropic magnetoresistance in the regime of weakly coupled semi - infinite chains . in figs .",
    "3a and 3c we plot the landauer transmission @xmath61 ( calculated from the caroli expression eq .",

    "the very small transmission is dominated by the @xmath34-channel , and therefore quite independent of @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the dos is very different for @xmath66 and @xmath45 .",

    "the conductance calculated in fig .",
    "3a from the caroli expression is indeed nicely reproduced .",
    "note , that the standard approximation by which the conductance is proportional to the product of the dos of the tip atoms , @xmath77 is obtained only if the @xmath73 matrix is assumed to be proportional to the identity , i.e. the tunneling matrix elements are assumed to conserve the orbital index and to be equal in size . however , this is far from being the case when @xmath8 and @xmath34 orbitals are involved .",
    "in fact , in the case considered here the conductance is completely dominated by the @xmath78 term , for which the orbitally - resolved dos @xmath79 is essentially independent of @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "the strong dependence of the global density of states on @xmath0 is _ not _ followed , in this case , by a strong dependence of the conductance on @xmath0 .",
    "notice that since the transmission is dominated by the @xmath34 channel both the orbital polarization of the current and the amr are negligible . in general ,",
    "an anisotropy in the dos is not a sufficient condition to have amr .",
    "the small variation of @xmath5 in fig .",
    "3b can be traced back to the variation of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath0 and the non - flat @xmath80 . in fig .",
    "4a we plot @xmath81 for a semi - infinite ni chain .",
    "@xmath82 can be as large as 10 mev .",
    "this change leads naturally to the second scenario for enhancement of the amr , considered in the next section : in a situation of resonant transport through the change of the chemical potential @xmath9 as a function of the magnetization direction can result in a large variation of @xmath1 , regardless of the degree of orbital polarization of the current .",
    "it has been recently suggested that these resonances could arise as localized tip states in ni wires thicker than those considered here @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider a different scenario , motivated by recent experiments@xcite and by the remarks at the end of the previous section .",
    "we study a single electron transistor ( set ) with ni electrodes @xcite and a non - magnetic central island ( ci ) with a discrete electronic spectrum .",
    "the ci is weakly coupled to the electrodes , so that the levels acquire a broadening @xmath10 .",
    "the position of these levels can be electrically tuned with a gate . whenever a level of the ci is in resonance with the fermi energy the zero bias conductance of the system",
    "has a maximum .",
    "we assume that both the level spacing of the ci states , @xmath83 , and the charging energy @xmath84 are much larger than the temperature @xmath85 which is larger than @xmath10 . under these conditions ,",
    "the system is in the coulomb blockade regime .    in equilibrium the chemical potential of the central island and that of the electrodes must be the same @xcite : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the number of electrons in the ci that satisfies this condition and @xmath88 is the energy level occupied by the last electron .",
    "> from this equation we immediately see that the charge state of the central island can be controlled both with the gate and with the orientation of the magnetization of the electrodes @xcite .",
    "this effect is reminiscent of the so called magneto coulomb effect , in which the chemical potential of the electrode is varied with the intensity of the applied field @xcite . here",

    "we take @xmath94 mev .",

    "notice that crossing the conductance peak , either by gate application or magnetization rotation , implies charging the ci by one electron @xcite .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "4b assume that @xmath10 is independent of @xmath0 , which is true as long as the resonant level is not coupled to the @xmath38 and @xmath36 bands . the height of the @xmath96 curves would depend on @xmath0 otherwise . in principle , a complete characterization of the @xmath89 curve would yield the @xmath81 and @xmath97 functions , which would provide valuable information of the electronic structure of the electrodes .",
    "we have presented _ ab initio _ quantum transport calculations of ni nanocontacts as a function of the magnetization direction , @xmath0 , going from the ballistic to the tunnel regime .",
    "we have shown that amr is unrelated from quantization of conductance , which is an artifact of the scattering free calculations and not expected in transition metal nanocontacts .",
    "we also show that a large variation of the density of states at @xmath9 as a function of @xmath0 is not a sufficient condition for large amr .",
    "we identify two sufficient conditions to obtain largely enhanced amr in quantum transport .",
    "first , in the coherent regime ( contact and tunneling ) , large amr is related to a large degree of orbital polarization of the current , for a selected direction of the magnetization .",
    "second , in systems with resonances close to @xmath9 , as it happens in single electron transistors with ferromagnetic electrodes , large amr is related to a large variation of the chemical potential @xmath9 of the electrode as a function of @xmath0 .",
