    "a remarkable observational effort has been devoted to the understanding of the intensity and polarization properties of this `` anomalous '' microwave emission , among other reasons , because of the importance of an accurate foreground correction of the cmb maps at low frequencies . among the various scenarios proposed to explain this emission , electric dipole radiation @xcite from very small ( n @xmath0 atoms ) rapidly rotating ( @xmath1 ) carbon based molecules in the interstellar medium ( the so - called `` _ spinning dust _ '' ) appears to reproduce well the observational constraints ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the detailed theoretical description of this family of models has been recently updated in @xcite , also including the effect of rotation of the dust grains around a non - principal axis @xcite . an alternative explanation based on magnetic dipole emission of spinning dust",
    "has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "measurements of the polarization properties of the anomalous microwave emission may potentially distinguish between these two models . according to @xcite , electric dipole radiation from spinning dust",
    "would be polarized at low frequencies , reaching a maximum ( 6 - 7% ) at 2 - 3  ghz and dropping to 4 - 5% at 10  ghz and progressively decreasing at higher frequencies .",
    "polarization from magnetic dipole emission predicts a different frequency behaviour and stronger linear polarization depending on the composition and shape of the emitting particles .    from the observational point of view , there is little information in the literature about the polarization properties of the anomalous emission .",
    "@xcite used the full - sky wmap 3-year data to constrain the polarization fraction of a diffuse anomalous component traced by the dust morphology .",
    "they concluded that the polarized anomalous emission contributes less than 1% of the observed polarization signal variance in any of the five wmap bands .",
    "only few attempts have been made to determine the polarization of the anomalous microwave emission in individual objects , and in the frequency range where this contribution is dominant ( 10 - 50  ghz ) .",

    "the sed for that region showed clear evidence for anomalous microwave emission , with a peaked spectrum around 20 - 30  ghz , indicative of spinning dust .",
    "indeed , w05 showed that an adequate fit to the sed can be achieved from 10 to 50  ghz only when including three components in the analysis : ( a ) optically thin free - free emission ; ( b ) vibrational dust emission with @xmath14  k and emissivity index of 1.55 ; and ( c ) a combination of the spinning dust models of @xcite for warm neutral medium and molecular cloud ( @xmath15wnm + @xmath16mc ) .",
    "no bright unresolved source that could be ultra - compact hii region or gigahertz - peaked source could be found .",
    "detailed observations of with the very small array ( vsa ) interferometer at 33  ghz @xcite and an angular resolution of 10 - 40  arcmin , showed that the region consists of five distinct components , all of which are found to exhibit a emission at 33  ghz which is highly correlated with the far - infrared emission .",
    "the most interesting result is that the vsa resolved out most of the emission in the region , as those five components contribute to only @xmath17 per cent to the total flux density of the diffuse extended emission detected in w05 .",
    "therefore , the bulk of the anomalous emission in is diffuse .    concerning the polarization level of the anomalous microwave emission in the region , the only measurement at the relevant frequencies ( 10 - 30  ghz ) done so far was presented in @xcite . using dual orthogonal polarizations with the cosmosomas experiment , the resulting total polarization level in at 11  ghz",
    "was found to be @xmath2 ( 95% confidence level ) .",
    "based on this value , they concluded that this weak detection of polarization would be associated to the spinning dust grains .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that is acting as a faraday screen hosting a strong regular magnetic field , which would rotate the background polarized emission .",
    "they suggest that a faraday screen model with a rotation measure of @xmath18  rad  m@xmath19 would explain the 11  ghz observations , as well as their new 11  cm effelsberg observations in the region ( see fig .  6 in that paper ) . in any case , even if the @xcite result is only an upper limit to the polarization level of the anomalous emission , its amplitude favours the electric dipole emission model with resonance paramagnetic relaxation ( see @xcite ) .    in this context , the seven - year wmap data represent an opportunity to update the measurements of intensity signal in the perseus region , as well as to constrain the polarization level of the anomalous microwave emission in the frequency range where this emission is dominant ( 20 - 30  ghz ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite , 90% of the emission in the region is diffuse , so the angular resolution of wmap data is sufficient to provide a reliable measurement .",
    "in this paper , we use the seven - year wmap data products @xcite , which are available in the lambda website in the healpix pixelisation scheme @xcite . in particular , we use the smoothed i , q and u maps , for each of the five frequency bands centered at 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 and 94  ghz ( k , ka , q , v and w respectively ) . the original angular resolution of these maps is approximately @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 respectively , but they are degraded to a common resolution of @xmath25 . for each map , a full description of the noise covariances ( ii , qq , uu , qu ) is provided .",
    "this information will be used in our analyses .",
    "we would like to stress that the wmap polarization maps are derived from the difference of two differential measurements .",
    "thus , the wmap measures a double difference in polarized intensity , not the intensity of the difference of the electric field as with interferometers and correlation receivers ( for further details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from those q and u maps at each frequency band",
    ", we can obtain the maps of the polarization intensity as @xmath26 , while the angle between the polarization direction of the electric field and the galactic meridian can be obtained as @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ ima : perseocalifornia ] shows a detailed view of the perseus molecular complex as seen in the ka - band of wmap ( 33  ghz ) . in this map , two strong sources are clearly visible : ( placed at the center of the image ) , and the hii region ngc1499 .",
    "this later object will be used as null hypothesis in our study , as free - free emission is known to be unpolarized .",
    "this null - test was also used in the study of @xcite .",
    "finally , the figure also displays six nearby regions which have been selected due to their low emission in intensity .",
    "these regions will be used below to characterize the behaviour of the background diffuse emission in the surroundings of .            as a reference for the sed in , in this work we use the data points from table  1 in w05 . in that table , in addition to the cosmosomas and wmap measurements , there are also data points at 0.408  mhz @xcite ; at 1420  mhz @xcite ; and at 100 , 140 and 240  @xmath3 m , based on the dirbe maps @xcite .",
    "here we have re - evaluated the intensity measurements on the haslam , wmap and dirbe maps , using the methodology described in section  [ sec : measuring ] .",
    "the derived fluxes are slightly higher than those presented in w05 ( by a factor of 5 - 13 per cent ) , although as pointed out below , this is probably due to the different methodology used for the flux determination in w05 .",
    "after w05 , @xcite used the ratan-600 telescope to obtain independent measurements in the region .",
    "although an estimate of the error bar of these new measurements is not provided in their paper , the overall shape of the sed in in the frequency range 1 - 20  ghz is fully compatible with the results of w05 , showing a rising spectrum in that frequency range .",
    "recently , @xcite presented preliminary results of the emission in at 11  cm and 6  cm with the effelsberg and the urumqi telescopes , respectively .",
    "these results support that the emission in the frequency range 2.7 - 5  ghz is compatible with an optically thin thermal gas , as expected from the sed in w05 .",
    "the only reported measurement to date of the radio polarized intensity in comes from the cosmosomas experiment at 11  ghz @xcite .",
    "the measured fractional polarization is @xmath28 ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "recently , @xcite presented preliminary results of the polarized emission in at 11  cm ( @xmath29  ghz ) with the effelsberg telescope .",
    "they reported a significant degree of polarization along the ring , which they interpreted as an indication that acts as a faraday screen rotating the polarization angle of the background emission in the region .",
    "however , this effect will be strongly suppressed at the peak frequencies of the anomalous emission ( 20 - 30  ghz ) as discussed below .",
    "@xcite presented a full - sky model of the polarized galactic microwave emission , considering in their analysis the polarization from the thermal dust and synchrotron emissions .",
    "the resulting polarized dust model obtained in this paper shows that the perseus molecular complex lies near to the boundaries of the p06 mask ( see mask definition in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the expected dust fractional polarization ( @xmath30 ) reaches @xmath31% and @xmath32% for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , inside p06 ; and @xmath35% outside the p06 mask .",
    "this fractional degree of polarization will be of importance when studying the high frequency behaviour of the polarized emission in the region .",
    "figures  [ ima : perseocalifornia ] and [ ima : perseo ] show that there is no obvious structure seen within the region in the polarization maps . in this case",
    ", we can not apply a similar method to the one used in w05 for the flux determination . in that paper , a simple elliptical gaussian model was used to describe the region , and fluxes were obtained using a direct fitting to the data .    here , we will adopt a direct aperture integration , or `` ring analysis '' , both for the intensity and polarization determinations . the practical implementation of this method has been previously used in other works @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is as follows . for a certain frequency map",
    ", we define a circular aperture around the object with radius @xmath36 , defining a solid angle @xmath37 around the source . in order to correct for the background emission ,",
    "a circular corona with radius @xmath38 is used . in order to preserve a similar area both for the source and the background flux estimation",
    ", we use the relation @xmath39 between the two apertures .",
    "this method provides an efficient correction of the background emission around the source for apertures ( @xmath36 values ) comparable to the beam size , although for larger apertures might be biased due to the background or cmb contributions .",
    "the error bar associated to this measurement contains the quadratic sum of two contributions , the pure instrumental noise and the increase of the variance due to the cmb fluctuations .",
    "it is important to note that the evaluation of both contributions should account for correlation terms . in the case of the cmb ,",
    "this is introduced by means of the two - point correlation function , which is evaluated using the ( measured ) wmap angular power spectrum . in the case of the noise , the correlation between pixels appears after the smoothing process , and is taken into account in a pixel - by - pixel basis .    as we will see below , in the case of the selected aperture for ( @xmath40 ) and the instrumental noise level of the wmap data ,",
    "the cmb contribution to the error bar is dominant for the intensity stokes parameter , while its contribution is negligible for stokes q and u. although the main focus of this paper is the polarization determination , for illustration we have also considered how the intensity measurements change with our aperture method when a cmb correction is performed before the flux determination . for that discussion , we have used the internal linear combination ( ilc ) map provided by the wmap team in the lambda webpage @xcite .",
    "although this map does not provide an optimal separation of cmb component , it provides a reasonable approximation which can be used to estimate its impact on the final intensity measurements .",
    "is relatively close to the galactic plane , in a region with a non - negligible diffuse emission which varies markedly with the position . in order to characterize the behaviour of this background emission , we have selected six regions with low emission in intensity in the surroundings of the perseus molecular complex .",
    "the central coordinates of the six regions are shown in table  [ tab : coord_r ] . around each of them",
    ", we have chosen the same aperture as for ( @xmath41 ) for the flux determination .",
    "table  [ tab : regions ] summarizes our results .",
    "in addition to the i , q , and u determinations at each frequency , we also include in the last two columns the values for the fluxes inside the inner aperture ( @xmath36 ) with no background correction .",
    "these numbers , quoted as q@xmath42 and u@xmath42 , will be used below for the analysis of the faraday rotation in the region ( sect .",
    "[ sec : result_perseo ] ) .",
    "the table also includes an estimation of the total linear polarization @xmath43 , and also the upper limit on this linear polarization @xmath44 that we would obtain in the null - hypothesis case using a zero signal ( @xmath45 ) and the same noise levels . as in all these values",
    "no detection is found , we quote upper limits which correspond to the 95% confidence level derived from a maximum likelihood approach based on the q and u measurements .",
    "we first note that at all frequencies , the main contribution to the error budget in intensity comes from the cmb part , which for illustration purposes is written separately in the table  [ tab : regions ] ( values in brackets in the second column ) .",
    "as one would expect , its relative contribution rises with approximately @xmath46 dependence , as the temperature sensitivity of wmap is comparable in all channels . in the case of q and u , the cmb contribution is negligible and it is not included in the error bar .    finally , as a summary of the results in table  [ tab : regions ] , we present in table  [ tab : statistic ] the peak - to - peak variations ( i@xmath47 ) , means and the root - mean - squares of these values for the six regions .",
    "we note that in the case of intensity , the variations in the three first frequencies ( 23 , 32 and 41  ghz ) is even larger than the expected cmb contribution , which implies that in addition there is a significant contribution to the error budget coming from the variations of the diffuse background in the surroundings .",
    "this effect is not seen in polarization , so in this case the error bars seem to be dominated by the instrumental noise contribution . however , we note that the average values of q@xmath42 and u@xmath42 show a small degree of diffuse polarization in the background , which is very well corrected by the ring analysis .

    "so will be our null - hypothesis for the polarization .",
    "california is also an extended object at this resolution . for consistency",

    "p and @xmath54 , as well as the null - case @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are presented in table  [ tab : california ] . a simple extrapolation of the dirbe fluxes to the wmap frequency range shows that the thermal dust emission is expected to be negligible between 20 - 100  ghz .",
    "thus , we expect that the main emission mechanism is the free - free emission . to check this prediction , we have derived the spectral index that best - fits the data obtained in the range 23 - 41  ghz , using a power law model ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we find @xmath58 , which is apparently in contradiction with the expected frequency behaviour for an optically thin free - free emitting region at these frequencies ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "however , this seems to be a effect of the residual cmb contribution to these measurements .",
    "if we correct the wmap maps from the cmb emission by subtracting the ilc map , the flux estimates at 23 , 32 and 41  ghz are now found to be 61.6 , 59.6 and 59.5  jy , respectively . using these values , we find @xmath60 , which is now compatible with the expected value .    concerning the polarization measurements , at all frequencies",

    "a comparison with the results in w05 shows that our fluxes are between 5 and 13 per cent higher in the first four channels ( 23 to 61  ghz ) , and 10 per cent smaller in the last channel ( 94  ghz ) .",
    "this small discrepancy is probably due to the different methodologies used to derive the fluxes . in w05 , an elliptical model for the region",
