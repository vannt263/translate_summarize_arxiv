    "as one of the few supernova remnants ( snrs ) that were historically recorded by people from different countries or continents @xcite , sn  1006  is of great interest and has been extensively studied at multiple energy bands .",
    "it is located far away from the galactic plane , with a galactic latitude of @xmath3145 , in a relatively low ambient - density ( @xmath4@xmath5 ; e.g. , @xcite ) environment .",
    "the long - term proper motion measurements of the shock front at optical narrow band , combined with the expanding velocity , implies a distance of @xmath32.2 kpc for the snr @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength emission from sn  1006  shows that the remnant has a diameter of 30(or 19 pc at 2.2 kpc ) , with two main lobes located at northeast ( ne ) and southwest ( sw ) parts of the snr s disk - like region .",
    "while the interior of the snr is dominated by thermal emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the shell is dominated by synchrotron emission which is bright in radio @xcite and hard x - ray @xcite bands .",
    "snrs are considered to be the main sites in the milky way for producing cosmic rays with energies up to a few 10@xmath6ev .",
    "charged particles are accelerated in their shock fronts due to the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as for sn  1006 , in addition to",
    "hard x - rays that indicate high - energy electrons accelerated to 100tev in the shock front @xcite , very high energy ( vhe ; @xmath7gev ) emission was also detected with the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) .",
    "the two hess sources j1504@xmath2418 and j1502@xmath2421 correspond to the ne and sw shell regions respectively @xcite , with the former approximately 50% brighter than the latter . given these , gev @xmath0-ray  emission from sn",
    "1006  has been searched in observations with the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( fermi ) . using 3.5 and 6 years of _ fermi _  lat data ,",
    "only upper limits have been obtained by @xcite and @xcite , respectively . combining the tev spectrum with the gev upper limits , a leptonic scenario , in which @xmath0-ray",
    "photons arise from the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering process , is favored for the @xmath0-ray  emission @xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _  upper limits already tightly constrain the models typically considered for young snrs ( e.g. , cas a : @xcite , @xcite ; tycho : @xcite ) or for snrs having a tev shell - like morphology @xcite .",
    "evidence for the interaction with a hi cloud in the sw limb region of sn  1006  has been reported by @xcite . with the release of the best _ fermi _  lat dataset ( pass 8 data ) in early 2015 and the accumulation of 7 years data , detailed analysis of the @xmath0-ray  emission from sn  1006",
    "is thus warranted . in this paper",

    "the events below 150 mev were excluded to reduce the effects of the galactic background and the relatively large uncertainties of the instrument response function of the lat in low energy range .",
    "the time period of the lat data is from 2008 - 08 - 04 15:43:36 ( utc ) to 2015 - 09 - 24 00:03:16 ( utc ) . following the recommendations of the lat team",
    ", we included those events with zenith angles less than 90 degrees , which prevents the earth s limb contamination , and excluded the events with quality flags of ` bad ' .",
    "we included all sources within 20 degrees centered at the position of sn  1006  in the _ fermi _ lat 4-year catalog @xcite to make the source model .",
    "the spectral forms of these sources are provided in the catalog .",
    "spectral parameters of the sources within 5 degrees from sn  1006  were set as free parameters , and the other parameters were fixed at their catalog values .",

    "[ fig : spectra ] ]",
    "having analyzed 7 years of _ fermi _  lat pass 8 data , we found excess @xmath0-ray emission at the sn  1006  region .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : tsmap ] and [ fig : spectra ] , both the position and spectrum ( i.e. , the high - energy data point at 30 gev ; see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) match those of the tev emission from the ne shell region of sn  1006  ( see @xcite for details )",
    ". the detected excess emission may well be the gev counterpart to sn  1006  that has been previously searched @xcite .",
    "we tested to repeat the analysis in @xcite , where 6 years of p7rep data were used , and obtained the same non - detection result as theirs .",
    "then as we changed to repeat our above analysis using pass 8 data in the same 6 years time period , the @xmath161 gev excess emission was detected with ts@xmath31 .",
    "therefore our detection of the source should be due to the overall sensitivity improvement in the pass 8 data .    .",
    "[ fig : model ] ]      considering the _ fermi _  source as the gev counterpart and combining its spectrum with the hess tev one , we checked if a leptonic model that has been proposed ( see @xcite ) could decribe the broadband spectrum of sn  1006 .",
    "we employed a simple one - zone stationary model , in which the synchrotron and ic emission originates from the same population of electrons with a power - law form plus an exponential cutoff . given the radio spectral index of @xmath30.6 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the electron spectral index was set to @xmath32 .",
    "to fit the data , for which we have included radio @xcite , x - ray @xcite , and gev and tev @xmath0-ray , the required parameters were found to be : the cutoff energy @xmath33 tev , the total electron energy @xmath34erg , and the magnetic field strength @xmath35 @xmath36 24 @xmath37 g .",
    "these parameter values are compatible with those considered in the previous leptonic models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the model spectrum are shown in figure  [ fig : model ] , where because the radio and x - ray data were emission from the whole remnant , the synchrotron flux was multiplied by a factor of 2 in our calculation assuming a symmetry between the ne and sw parts for simplicity .",
    "not surprisingly as indicated by the previous studies , the leptonic model generally can describe the broadband data .",
    "the observed flux at 1.5 gev is higher than the model flux , but within the 2@xmath20 uncertainty .",
    "analysis of the lastest _ fermi _  lat pass 8 data for the sn  1006  region results in the detection of a source at a @xmath1 significance level in 0.15300gev .",
    "the spectrum of the excess emission can be described by a @xmath38 power law ( the dashed line in figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) , which can be connected to the hess spectrum . both the quasar qso j1504@xmath24152 @xcite and the vhe source hess j1504@xmath2418 @xcite are within the 2@xmath20 error circle of the best - fit position of the source .",
    "we searched for variability in the source , but no significant variations were found .",
    "in addition the spectral index of 1.9 does not favor the association to agn since agn generally have soft power - law spectra with photon indices up to @xmath33.0 in the lat @xmath0-ray  energy range @xcite .",
    "all of these indicate the source is more likely the gev counterpart to sn  1006 .",
    "the combined _ fermi _  lat and hess spectrum can be described by a leptonic model with reasonable parameters , although the data point at 1.5 gev is slightly higher than our model spectrum .",
    "the discrepancy may suggest that a more complicated model , e.g. , multi - emission zones , would be needed in order to better fit the broadband sed . on the other hand , we note that the index @xmath39 is compatible with those of the other 4 ( rx j1713.7@xmath23946 , rx j0852.0@xmath24622 , rcw  86 , and hess j1731@xmath2347 ; @xmath40 ) tev shell snrs summarized by @xcite .",
    "this similarity may provide additional evidence for supporting the @xmath0-ray  excess emission as the counterpart to the snr .",
    "at the source distance of 2.2 kpc , the 0.15300gev luminosity is 1@xmath41 erg s@xmath19 , estimated from the best - fit model .",
    "the luminosity value is consistent with the general emissional property for the currently _ fermi _  detected snrs : young snrs ( with ages no larger than a few thousands of years ) have @xmath0-ray  luminosities of @xmath42@xmath43ergs@xmath19 , while middle - aged , dynamically evolved snrs are two orders of magnitude brighter due to their interaction with nearby molecular clouds ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "finally , @xcite have reported that the sw limb of sn  1006  is interacting with an atomic cloud , and predicted a 330 gev flux of @xmath44 erg@xmath26s@xmath19 based on their hadronic model proposed to explain the tev emission .",
    "the flux is reached with the current _ fermi _  lat data ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "however in our analysis , we did not see any significant sources in the sw region of sn  1006   ( see figure  [ fig : tsmap ] ) . a simple estimation for its flux can be used by scaling the ne flux with the ratio between the hess sw and ne fluxes ( 0.67 ; @xcite ) , which gives 1.53.4@xmath45erg@xmath26s@xmath19 and 0.83.6@xmath45erg@xmath26s@xmath19 at 1.5 and 30 gev ( table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) , respectively . with the _ fermi _  lat observation time increasing for the source region",
    ", it can be expected that the sw gev emission would likely be detected in the near future .",
    "the detection will help confirm our result presented here in this work .",
