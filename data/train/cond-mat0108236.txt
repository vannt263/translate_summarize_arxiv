    "unipolar quantum cascade lasers ( qcls ) utilizing intersubband transitions to generate photons have become important sources of light in the mid - infrared region ( 5 @xmath0 m - 15 @xmath0 m ) . in this paper a comprehensive model for the photon intensity fluctuations in qcls",
    "is reported for the first time .",
    "current noise associated with electron transport through the active regions is also studied and its effect on the photon intensity noise is evaluated .",
    "qcls are different from interband semiconductor diode lasers in three important ways which can have a significant impact on their noise properties :    1 .",
    "electron transport in qcls takes place by tunneling between states in adjacent quantum wells .",
    "it is well known that electronic correlations in resonant tunneling in quantum well structures can suppress ( or enhance ) current noise by providing a negative ( or positive ) feedback  @xcite .",
    "high impedance suppression of the current noise in semiconductor diode lasers results in light output with squeezed photon number fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore intriguing whether suppression of the current noise can also lead to squeezing in qcls .",
    "any model for the photon noise in qcls must take into account these electronic correlations self - consistently .",
    "2 .   in diode lasers",
    "the carrier density in the energy level involved in the lasing action does not increase beyond its threshold value and , therefore , the noise contributed by the non - radiative recombination and generation processes also remains unchanged beyond threshold . in qcls the electron densities in the upper and lower lasing states do not clamp at threshold , and keep increasing when the bias current is increased beyond threshold . as a result ,",
    "non - radiative processes contribute significantly to photon noise even at high bias currents .",
    "3 .   since all the gain sections in a qcl are connected electrically and optically , electron density fluctuations and photon emission events in different gain sections become correlated .",
    "the effect of these correlations on the photon noise in interband cascade lasers has already been discussed in detail  @xcite , and it is the aim of this paper to investigate the role of these correlations in qcls .",
    "in section  [ steadystate ] the non - linear rate equations for the electron and photon densities in qcls are presented . the steady state solution of these rate equations below and above threshold",
    "are described . in section  [ noisemodels ]",
    "the non - linear rate equations are linearized to obtain langevin rate equations for the fluctuations in the electron and photon densities .",
    "electron transport in the multiple quantum well structure of qcls is discussed in detail , and a self - consistent model for the fluctuations in the electron charge densities and the electron current density is presented .",
    "it is shown that a self - consistent description of the fluctuations in the charge and current densities can be carried out in terms of a few device parameters .",
    "langevin noise sources are also used to model the noise associated with electron transport by tunneling .",
    "section  [ noisemodels ] is the main part of this paper . in section  [ solofeq ]",
    "the set of coupled linearized langevin rate equations for the fluctuations in the electron densities in different levels of all the cascaded gain stages and the fluctuations in the photon density are solved under the constraints imposed by the biasing electrical circuit .",
    "in addition , the direct current modulation response of qcls is also evaluated and the maximum possible modulation bandwidth is discussed .",
    "the analytical and numerical results on the current noise and the photon noise in qcls are presented and discussed in section  [ disscusscn ] and section  [ disscusspn ] , respectively . in these sections",
    "the results obtained are compared with the current and photon noise in interband semiconductor diode lasers .",
    "readers not familiar with the results on the current and photon noise in diode lasers are encouraged to read appendix  [ intnoise ] in which a detailed model for the noise in diode lasers is presented .",
    "many different types of qcl structures have been reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "almost all of these qcl structures can be classified into two categories :    1 .",
    "_ superlattice qcls _ in which the gain stage consists of a superlattice structure and the photons are emitted when the electrons make transitions between two minibands of this superlattice .",
    "these minibands are actually clusters of closely spaced energy levels ( fig .",
    "[ figsqcl ] )  @xcite .",
    "_ multiple quantum well qcls _ in which the gain stage consists of multiple quantum wells ( typically two or three ) and the radiative electronic transitions occur between two discrete energy levels ( fig .",
    "[ figmqcl ] )  @xcite .    in both types of qcls ,",
    "two successive gain stages are separated by a superlattice structure known as the _ injector_.",
    "the superlattice injector has a mini - gap which prevents the electrons from tunneling out into the injector from the upper energy level(s ) of the previous gain stage and , therefore , increases the radiative efficiency .",
    "electrons from the lower energy level(s ) of a gain stage can tunnel into the injector , and the injector injects these electrons into the upper energy level(s ) of the next gain stage .    in this paper ,",
    "photon noise and current noise in only multiple quantum well qcls is discussed .",
    "however , the methods described here can easily be used to study noise in qcls with superlattice gain stages . a single stage of a multiple quantum well qcl structure is shown in fig .  [ figmqcl ]",
    "the operation of the qcl can be described as follows .",
    "electrons tunnel from the energy states in the superlattice injector into level 3 of the gain stage .",
    "photons are emitted when electrons make radiative transitions from level 3 to level 2 .",
    "transitions from level 2 to level 1 occur primarily by emission of optical phonons .",
    "electrons leave the gain stage from level 1 by tunneling out into the injector of the next stage .",
    "in addition , electrons also make non - radiative transitions from level 3 to levels 2 and 1 .",
    "the non - linear rate equations for the electron and photon densities can be written as , @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5    in the above equations , @xmath6 is the electron density ( @xmath7 ) in the @xmath8th energy level of the @xmath9th gain stage . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electron current densities ( @xmath7 ) tunneling into level 3 and tunneling out of level 1 of the @xmath9th gain stage , respectively . only in steady state @xmath10 equals @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the photon density ( @xmath7 ) inside the optical cavity .",
    "@xmath12 is equal to the total number of photons inside the cavity divided by the width @xmath13 and the length @xmath14 of the cavity .",

    "the power output coupling efficiency @xmath25 from the facet with reflectivity @xmath30 is , @xmath32 } \\ ; \\frac{\\alpha_{m } } { ( \\alpha_{m } + \\alpha_{i } ) } \\label{eqetao1}\\ ] ]    for simplicity it is assumed that all the gain stages have the same mode confinement factor , i.e. @xmath33 for all @xmath9 .",
    "this assumption is valid if all the cascaded gain stages are located close to the peak of the transverse profile of the optical mode where the field strength varies slowly . even for qcls with large number of gain stages numerical simulations",
    "show that corrections to the solution obtained by assuming all @xmath18 to be equal are small . under this assumption ,",
    "the steady state electron densities @xmath6 are the same in all the gain stages , and the index @xmath9 may be suppressed .        the steady state solution to the rate equations can be found by setting all the time derivatives equal to zero , and putting @xmath34 . below threshold ,",
    "steady state carrier densities can be found by putting @xmath35 , and solving the equations ( the index @xmath9 has been suppressed ) , @xmath36 @xmath37 the third equation can be obtained by realizing that @xmath38 is also a function of @xmath39 , @xmath40 to proceed further , analytical expressions for the transition rates are required .",
    "these transition rates can be approximated as , @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 the rationale for the approximations in equations ( [ r32])-([r21 ] ) is that optical phonons are largely responsible for intersubband transitions .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ figengysubband ] , optical phonon mediated intersubband transitions that are almost horizontal in @xmath45-@xmath46 plane are more likely to occur  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the transitions rates from an upper to a lower subband are not much affected by the electron density in the lower subband , as long as the electron density in the lower subband is small .",
    "more complicated expressions for these transition rates , such as , @xmath47 may be used if necessary .    the expression for @xmath38 in equation ( [ rout ] ) does not depend upon on the electron density in the injector since electrons in the injector states are assumed to relax very quickly into the ground state of the injector which is spatially localized near the next gain stage . using equations ( [ r32])-([rout ] ) in equations ( [ dc1])-([dc3 ] ) ,",
    "expressions for the carrier densities can be obtained as a function of the current density , @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50      above threshold , the gain is clamped to a value determined by equating the gain with the loss , @xmath51 for perfectly parabolic subbands , the expression for the gain may be approximated as , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the differential gain .",
    "the carrier and photon densities above threshold can be obtained by solving the equations , @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 which results in , @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where the threshold current density @xmath62 and the radiative efficiency @xmath63 are , @xmath64 @xmath65 the radiative efficiency @xmath63 for a qcl is defined as that fraction of the total number of electrons injected into each gain stage which contribute to photon emission .",
    "equation  ( [ dcpow ] ) shows that the slope efficiency of the laser scales linearly with the number of gain stages @xmath19 .",
    "equations ( [ n3ath ] ) and ( [ n2ath ] ) show that above threshold , even though the gain is clamped to its threshold value , the electron densities keep increasing with the bias current .",
    "this is in contrast to semiconductor diode lasers in which the carrier densities do not increase beyond their threshold values . as a result ,",
    "an increase in the injected current density in qcls does not only lead to an increase in the photon emission rate but it also leads to an increase in the rate of non - radiative transitions .",
    "therefore , qcls tend to have radiative efficiencies @xmath63 significantly smaller than unity . fig .",

    "[ figcarden ] shows that the rate of change of electron densities in levels 3 and 2 with the bias current exhibits discontinuities at threshold .",
    "this can be confirmed by comparing equations ( [ n3ath ] ) and ( [ n2ath ] ) with equations ( [ n3bth ] ) and ( [ n2bth ] ) . as will be shown later in this paper , these discontinuities in the rate of increase of electron densities with the bias current result in a discontinuity in the value of the differential resistance of the laser at threshold .",
    "the model for the noise presented in this paper consists of a set of coupled self - consistent langevin rate equations for the fluctuations in the electron density in different energy levels of a gain stage .",
    "fluctuations in the electron density are caused by radiative and non - radiative scattering processes , electron tunneling processes and also by fluctuations in the current injected into the gain stage .",
    "fluctuations in the current are a relaxational response to electron scattering and tunneling events occurring inside all the gain stages of the qcl , and they are also caused by sources external to the laser which include thermal noise sources associated with circuit resistances .",
