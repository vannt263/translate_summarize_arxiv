    "in a recent publication @xcite we presented results for inner - heliospheric solar wind conditions from simulations based on observational boundary conditions derived from the wang - sheeley - arge ( wsa , @xcite ) model .",
    "the obtained 3d configurations provide the basis for subsequent studies of energetic particle transport . for a long time",
    ", the standard approach to couple the solar wind dynamics to the transport of charged energetic particles has been to parameterise all transport processes in terms of ` background ' quantities such as the large - scale solar wind velocity and heliospheric magnetic field strength .",
    "this was particularly true for the treatment of spatial diffusion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . only in recent years",
    "so - called _ ab - initio _ models were developed , in which the diffusion coefficients are formulated explicitly as functions of small - scale , low - frequency turbulence quantities such as the magnetic field fluctuation amplitude or the correlation length ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this significant improvement has been possible , on the one hand due to the development of turbulence transport models that , most often , describe the evolution of turbulent energy density , cross - helicity , and correlation lengths for low - frequency turbulence , as observed in the solar wind , with increasing distance from the sun , see , e.g. , the review in @xcite . on the other hand , our present - day knowledge about turbulence in the solar wind ( see ,",
    "e.g. , the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has increased tremendously since the first measurements @xcite thanks to highly sophisticated analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after the pioneering papers by @xcite and @xcite and first systematic studies of the radial evolution of turbulence quantities @xcite , major progress has only been achieved in recent years .",
    "first , @xcite improved the previous modeling by considering off - ecliptic latitudes .",
    "second , in @xcite this turbulence model was extended to full time dependence and three spatial dimensions . in the same paper",
    "the turbulence evolution equations were simultaneously solved along with a large - scale mhd model of the supersonic solar wind .",
    "while @xcite extended this study further with the incorporation of pick - up ions and electrons as separate fluids , as well as an eddy - viscosity approximation to self - consistently account for turbulence driven by shear , @xcite undertook another extension of the modeling by considering not only one but two , mutually interacting , incompressible components , namely quasi - two - dimensional turbulent and wave - like fluctuations . the effect on turbulence due to changing solar wind conditions in the outer heliosphere during the solar cycle have recently been addressed by @xcite .",
    "all of the mentioned models have one limitation in common , namely the condition that the alfvn speed @xmath0 is significantly lower than that of the solar wind @xmath1 , which precludes their application to the heliocentric distance range below about 0.3  au . the turbulence in this region and its consequences for the dynamics of the solar wind",
    "have been studied on the basis of the somewhat simplified transport equations for the wave power spectrum and the wave pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the alfvn speed limitation in the more detailed models was very recently removed with a new , comprehensive approach to the general problem of the transport of low - frequency turbulence in astrophysical flows by @xcite , see also @xcite . not only are the derived equations formally valid close to the sun in the sub - alfvnic regime of the solar wind , but they also represent an extension of the treatment of turbulence by non - parametrically and quantitatively considering the evolution of the so - called energy difference in velocity and magnetic field fluctuations , and by explicitly describing correlation lengths for sunward and anti - sunward propagating fluctuations as well as for the energy difference ( sometimes also referred to as the residual energy ) .    in our previous modeling",
    "@xcite we derived inner boundary conditions beyond the alfvnic critical point at 0.1  au by means of the wsa model .",
    "this approach matches a potential field solution for the coronal magnetic field to the observed photospheric magnetograms , and the resulting magnetic field topology can be linked empirically to the corresponding solar wind speed for every open field line @xcite .",
    "we performed simulations of the inner - heliospheric solar wind conditions for several carrington rotations .",
    "subsequently , the resulting time - dependent 3d configuration is used to study the transport of charged energetic particles by means of stochastic differential equations ( a.  kopp , priv .",
    "comm . ) . within that study ,",
    "the transport coefficients required for the latter model have so far been estimated from the large - scale quantities provided by the ideal mhd equations ( see discussion above ) . in order to obtain more realistic transport coefficients for the study of propagation of charged energetic particles , we extend our previous modeling by solving the 3d time - dependent turbulence tranport equations self - consistently coupled to the reynolds - averaged mhd equations .",
    "such an approach was taken by @xcite and will provide the starting point for our modeling . in a first step we validate our implementation by comparing with these authors findings .",
    "the turbulence transport equations used there can also be obtained from the more general turbulence transport equations of @xcite by applying respective simplifications .",
    "the usmanov model neglects the alfvn velocity and is therefore only applicable to highly - super - alfvnic solar wind regimes and we remove this constraint by retaining the respective terms of the more general zank model .",
    "this extention to the model allows us to place the inner boundary of the simulations closer to the sun , for which we choose 0.1  au for future couplings to the wsa model .",
    "a correction of the model is also required with regard to the unappropriate absence of turbulence driving by shear , which has only recently been addressed by @xcite . here",
    ", we will follow earlier simple ad - hoc approaches as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this improvement is essential for the application to solar wind transients , such as coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , which we address in the second part of this paper .    with this application to the propagation of coronal mass ejections ( cmes )",
    "we extend earlier approaches towards a self - consistent treatment of the expansion of the disturbed solar wind .",
    "such a treatment is desirable because it has been realized that a proper modeling of cmes requires a realistic model for the ` background ' solar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if one does not resort to empirical solar wind background models ( like",
    "* ) , one needs to model the solar wind turbulence explicitly @xcite . besides the importance of a self - consistent incorporation of the turbulence evolution in the solar wind for cme propagation studies",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the generation of turbulence by large - scale disturbances is of interest for energetic particle transport studies at interplanetary shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while a self - consistent turbulence incorporation into a model of the supersonic solar wind out to 100  au including corotating interaction regions has been achieved by @xcite , corresponding studies for the case of cmes are still limited to the most inner heliosphere inside about 30 solar radii @xcite",
    "these studies use , compared to the approaches developed by @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , simplified equations for the treatment of the turbulence evolution .",
    "we extend the modeling here by both employing a refined treatment of the turbulence evolution and solving the self - consistent model equations out to 1.2  au .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : code ] we present the turbulence transport equations and the respective coupling to the ideal mhd equations .",

    "section [ sec : validation ] is used to validate our implementation by comparing with the respective results of @xcite .",
    "we present the extensions we apply to the model and demonstrate their effects in section [ sec : extension ] . in section [ sec : innerheliosphere ] we move the inner boundary closer to the sun and show results for both quiet and cme - disturbed cases .",
    "we conclude with a summary and an outlook on future improvements in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite to incorporate the evolution equations of small - scale turbulence quantities into the framework of the mhd code cronos ( see appendix [ app_cronos ] for details concerning the code ) . as we will seek to inject coronal mass ejections at an inner boundary of 0.1 au , the assumption of highly - super - alfvnic solar wind conditions is not justifiable everywhere .",
    "the turbulence transport equations are extended to keep terms associated with the alfvn velocity , which can be derived from a simplified model by @xcite ( see appendix [ appendixa0 ] ) , while we employ the coupling between small - scale and large - scale equations as given in @xcite .",

    "the magnetic field corresponds to a parker spiral configuration with a change of sign at the equator , resulting in a flat current - sheet there .",
    "the turbulence quantities are set accordingly to higher values in the fast wind , decreasing to smaller values in the slow wind ( see also figure [ fig : usm - slices ] for an overview ) .",

    "our results are generally in good agreement with the newly obtained reference values , but some small deviations exist that will be addressed when briefly describing the results below : the magnetic field strength ( top left ) decreases as @xmath65 at the poles , where it is purely radial , while for lower latitudes the azimuthal component decreasing as @xmath66 becomes dominant .",
    "slight differences with regard to the reference case are present as a result of the different boundary conditions .",
    "this is more clearly visible in the panel for the alfvn velocity ( bottom left ) , however , the asymptotic values are in very good agreement .",
    "the total turbulent energy @xmath5 ( top right ) decays gradually within about 10  au , after which the turbulence generation via pickup ions becomes important and flattens the profiles .",
    "since the pickup - ion source term is proportional to @xmath0 there is a latitude dependence resulting in a later onset of profile flattening towards high latitudes .",
    "the match between the results is excellent in the high - speed wind region , while the results at the equator beyond 10  au are off .",
    "this is because of our constrained transport scheme involving staggered grids , where the magnetic field is stored on respective cell surfaces and the other quantities at cell centers .",
    "the current sheet is implemented best with an even number of cells in polar angle so that there is actually no cell in which @xmath67 .",
    "this in turn gives no zero pickup ion term ( by means of a non - vanishing @xmath0 entering ) , which explains the higher values for the total turbulent energy at the equator .",
    "the cell - centered quantities are actually located at half - integer values , so that in figure [ fig : usm - comp ] our results are respectively offset by a half degree from those of usmanov , which can also be expected to give some minor deviations .",
    "+ the dissipated energy is transferred into heat so that the temperature ( or pressure , related through number density ( middle panels ) ) is higher than would be the case for an adiabatically cooling wind for given @xmath68 .",
    "this is also reflected in slightly higher terminal radial velocities ( left center ) , where the equatorial wind is faster than in the reference case because of the dissipated higher turbulent energy as mentioned above .",
    "the cross - helicity gives the ratio between inward and outward propagating modes .",
    "as we have an inwardly directed mean magnetic field in the considered upper hemisphere , only the anti - parallel @xmath18 modes can escape the sub - alfvnic region below about @xmath69 , so that @xmath6 is close to unity .",
    "as new turbulence  specifically also parallel propagating modes @xmath19  are generated in the outer - heliosphere the ratio between the modes goes to zero .",
    "the interesting feature of increased cross - helicity between 1 - 10  au is due to the additional mixing term @xmath60 .",
    "this term simplifies for a constant radial solar wind speed and parker spiral magnetic field , resulting in @xmath70 so that via @xmath71 a latitude dependence is introduced .",
    "the effect of this term is to inhibit equipartition between forward and backward propagating modes by prefering the generation of forward propagating modes , before the onset of additional turbulence generation via pickup - ions beyond 10  au becomes dominant .",
    "meanwhile , the deviations with respect to the reference results for the @xmath58 curve are due to a lower value of magnetic field strength here as described above .",
    "the rate of dissipation is controlled by the correlation length @xmath9 that initially rises gradually to a maximum depending on latitude and then decreases again as a result of the interplay between the right - hand terms of equation ( [ eq : lam ] ) .",
    "the breaks at about 10  au are again caused by the pickup - ion term , indicating that sources of turbulence tend to decrease the correlation length , which will also be addressed when including shear driving below .",
    "+ the overview presented in figure [ fig : usm - slices ] also shows the ratio of turbulent magnetic field to mean magnetic field @xmath64 as an additional quantity , which can be calculated via @xmath72 for given ( constant ) @xmath7 .",
    "this quantity bears great importance for the transport of energetic particles in the heliosphere as it is a measure for the efficiency of diffusion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the results show that although the turbulent energy is low in polar regions , the magnetic field strength there diminishes more rapidly and results in high diffusion levels that gradually decrease towards the ecliptic .",
    "it is stated in @xcite that their model does not seem to require additional source terms to account for the effects of turbulence driven by shear . however , as acknowledged in @xcite , this is not the case .",
    "furthermore , this is also pointed out in appendix a of @xcite , where it is noted that these kind of turbulence transport models do not capture turbulence driven by shear terms due to the imposed structural similarity closure relations , such that instead these terms have to be explicitly accounted for via additional source terms .",
    "@xcite incorporated shear effects with an eddy viscosity approximation , which we intend to adopt in our implementation for future studies as well .",
    "for now we include the required terms in a similar fashion as in @xcite and @xcite , but in improvement to these models we compute the gradients in the solar wind speed self - consistently from the background field via @xmath73 we use a value of @xmath74 , which is commonly taken at high latitudes ( no shear ) to match observational results @xcite .",
    "previous studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) have estimated typical values for gradients in the solar wind speed and absorbed them in the definition for @xmath75 so that it is varying with position . here ,",
    "we treat @xmath76 as a constant and get an equivalent expression for @xmath75 as indicated in equation ( [ eq : shear ] ) .",
    "+        figure [ fig : shear - comp ] shows a comparison of simulations using the above setup with and without the shear term in meridional slices at different heliocentric distances ( solid : 1au , dashed : 10au ) .",
    "the black ( red ) lines show the results ( not ) including the shear term , while the blue lines are taken from @xcite . as expected , differences arise mainly in the transition region between slow and fast solar wind ( at about 70 ",
    "@xmath77 ) , which gives rise to shear . considering the 1au slices ( solid lines ) first",
    ", it can be seen that the shear term leads to ( otherwise absent ) enhancements in turbulent energy , which are comparable to the enhancements in the breech results , where the latter are at slightly lower colatitudes due to different modeling of the transition region .",
    "meanwhile , the cross - helicity is now strongly decreased in this region due to the newly generated turbulence , which is also qualitatively visible in the breech data , who however used lower boundary values for the cross - helicity so that it is initially lower .",
    "while the correlation length is enhanced in the breech model , it is decreasing in the shear region in our model .",
    "this is due to our inclusion of the term in the respective equation ( [ eq : lam ] ) for the correlation length , where as mentioned above with regard to the pickup - ion source term , the generation of turbulence leads to decreased correlation lengths .",
    "the shear term is absent in the evolution equation for @xmath9 in the breech model , where it is assumed that shear drives turbulence at all scales .",
    "as our starting point for the turbulence transport equations is the model by @xcite , who include this term also in the correlation length equation , we will maintain it as well . while at 1au the resulting temperature enhancement is similar to the one in breech ( different boundary values again cause an overall lower temperature here ) , the results at larger radial distances show some differences : in our model the turbulent energy just barely peaks at the transition region and the temperature is only slightly enhanced as well , whereas in the breech model the peak becomes ever more pronounced .",
    "this is the result of an interplay between the generation of turbulence due to shear , which weakens with radial distance , and its dissipation controlled by the correlation length .",
    "a more detailed study addressing the effect of shear on the correlation length might be in order to clarify proper modeling .",
    "we want to mention though that ulysses data for solar minimum conditions ( plate 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do not seem to show evidence for a strongly enhanced temperature in this region .",
    "the model can be readily extended to include terms involving the alfvn velocity .",
    "we maintain the same boundary conditions as before and the results are compared to the ones neglecting alfvn velocity in figure [ fig : va - comp ] .",
    "the effect on the large - scale quantities is negligible and , thus , not shown .",
    "the turbulence quantities also show only minor differences : the turbulent energy tends to be up to about 1.5 times higher at high latitudes and the correlation length is almost unaffected . near the equator",
    "the results are almost identical for all quantities .",
    "the normalized cross - helicity also tends to stay about 10% larger when including the additional terms .",
    "these deviations occur close to the inner boundary , where the alfvn speed is highest , and the resulting higher cross - helicity values are convected to larger radial distances .",
    "this effect is expected to be more prominent when moving the inner boundary closer to the sun , as will be done in the subsequent section . for an inner boundary at about 0.3  au as considered so far",
    ", the neglect of the alfvn velocity terms is therefore justifiable to some extent , but the effect of enhanced cross - helicity could be incorporated in models neglecting these terms by increasing the boundary values accordingly .",
    "the turbulence transport equations ( [ eq : z2 ] )  ( [ eq : lam ] ) now also accomodate the effect of shear driving by means of equation ( [ eq : shear ] ) so that the model can be applied to solar wind transients with arbitrary gradients in solar wind speed . in section [ sec",
    ": cme ] we apply the above set of equations to a `` toy - model '' cme and study the results in comparison to the model not including turbulence .",
    "furthermore , including terms involving the alfvn velocity enables us to move the inner boundary closer to the sun . in the following the inner boundary",
    "is located at 0.1  au , which is usually just beyond the alfvn critical radius .",
    "this is a suitable choice for the following reasons : ( i ) the turbulence transport model is only partly appropriate for sub - alfvnic regions such as the corona or the heliosheath . specifically , the dissipation terms are subtle to model for low - beta regions and still need to be properly adapted for such cases ( g.  zank , priv .",
    "comm . ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "( ii ) coronal mhd models are much more complex and are computationally quite expensive . a simplified model of the corona is the wsa model that is frequently used to derive boundary conditions for heliospheric mhd simulations such as in our previous work @xcite or in the enlil code @xcite , which is in operation at the space weather prediction center .",
    "here , the interface between wsa and mhd is usually located at 0.1  au , so that especially for future purposes , where we will aim to perform the simulations with input from the wsa model , this would be the obvious choice .",
    "( iii ) when applying our model to interplanetary disturbances such as cmes , it is desirable to catch as much of their evolution self - consistently , which demands to put the inner boundary as close to the sun as possible",
    ". given the above caveats , this currently can not be done in a more self - consistent manner by triggering a reconnection event at the coronal base ( as in , e.g. , @xcite ) , but instead an estimate for cme properties at intermediate distances has to be found ( see section [ sec : cme ] ) .",

    "we first describe the quiet background solar wind , into which a cme will be injected .",
    "cmes occur more frequently during periods of solar maximum , which is characterized by a highly tilted current sheet and disapperance of the region of fast polar solar wind , so that instead a slow wind is present at all latitudes . for simplicity , and since we leave out the polar coordinate singularity , we resort to a simple flat current sheet .",
    "this also allows us to keep the analysis of the results relatively tractable .",
    "+ we estimated respective boundary conditions at @xmath84au for the large - scale quantities from typical values used in our previous work employing the wsa model @xcite .",
    "the boundary values and the resulting radial evolution at selected colatitudes are shown in figure [ fig : quiet - turb ] ( black lines ) , where for orientation the findings of @xcite ( red lines ) from 0.3 au onwards are shown as well .",
    "the resulting configuration is similar to the equatorial slow speed region from the previous section but with slightly enhanced speeds , higher temperature , and lower density , while the magnetic field is the same as before . for the turbulent energy and the correlation length we use boundary values that also give similar radial profiles as shown previously , but for the cross - helicity it should be assumed that just beyond the alfvnic critical radius there are almost only forward propagating modes , so that @xmath85 should be close to unity and we choose @xmath86 . as shown above , including the alfvn velocity terms in the model tends to retain cross - helicity values closer to unity , and since there are no additional sources of turbulence so far the cross - helicity now remains larger at and beyond 0.3 au in contrast to the usmanov values .    . ]",

    "* ) , but we estimate typical cme properties at the intermediate distance of @xmath87  au from simulations performed by @xcite . we find that the shape of the cme in these simulations remains similar to the initialized one , as was also reported in previous studies and motivated the cone model @xcite , which is also used to initiate cmes in the enlil setup @xcite .",
    "the almost radial propagation of cmes through the corona allows for an easy geometrical estimation of its properties a few solar radii away from the sun .",
    "while for space weather forecasting studies such estimates are based on observations , here we consider a `` toy model '' with idealized properties .",
    "we first define the normalized angular distance of a given point @xmath81 $ ] on the spherical inner boundary to the center of the cme onset site @xmath81_{cme}=[0.5,1]\\pi$ ] as @xmath88/\\delta_{cme } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath89_{0,cme } = [ \\sin(\\vartheta_{cme})\\cos(\\varphi_{cme } ) , \\sin(\\vartheta_{cme})\\sin(\\varphi_{cme}),\\cos(\\vartheta_{cme})]$ ] are the cartesian coordinates of the site s center , and @xmath90 denotes its angular radius . within this circular patch characterized by @xmath91",
    ", we raise the large - scale fluid quantities during the cme initialisation according to @xmath92_{cme } = [ 8v_r , 4 t , 1.5n]_{quiet}\\cos(0.5\\pi\\cdot a)f(t)$ ] , so that the enhancement peaks at the center and decreases towards the edges of the circular area .",
    "for the time dependence we choose a linearly decreasing function @xmath93 from maximal values at @xmath94 back to quiet values at @xmath95 with a duration of @xmath96 , where our normalization value for time @xmath97s .",
    "furthermore , the onset time @xmath98 is chosen as such that the initial quiet conditions have reached steady - state . +",
    "although the magnetic field strength could be simply raised as the other quantities , this would not change the fields topology ( parker spiral ) , which we assume to be affected qualitatively by the cme s onset .",
    "we therefore prescribe an additional strong @xmath99 component as to get field - lines wrapping around the central region of the cme . to preserve the solenoidality constraint we directly prescribe the vector potential @xmath100 where @xmath101 gives rise to the parker spiral magnetic field , while @xmath102 results in the desired field lines wrapping around the cme ( see figure [ fig : cme - para ] ) . + meanwhile , we leave the turbulence quantities at the quiet solar wind boundary values .",
    "this is probably not a realistic assumption as the evolution in the sub - alfvnic region should have an impact on the turbulence quantities as well .",
    "however , on the one hand there is little to no observational data of turbulence associated with cmes this close to the sun , and on the other hand , prescribing respective estimates as boundary conditions for the turbulence different from the quiet wind ones would make it more difficult to analyse the self - consistent evolution of these quantities beyond 0.1  au , i.e.  the influence of different boundary conditions and the evolution due to the governing equations would be impossible to disentangle .",
    "+      an overview of the resulting 3d structure is shown in figure [ fig : cme - para ] .",
    "the field lines show the typical parker spiral pattern far away from the cme , while close by they wrap around it .",

    "the time evolution as an animation of this figure is available in the supplementary material . ]    due to the wealth in structure involved , we show results in 2d slices .",
    "first , we present meridional slices at @xmath103 in figure [ fig : cme - turb ] so that they conincide with the azimuthal symmetry axis of the _ initial _ cme .",
    "the evolution in time is available as a movie in the supplementary material . here",
    ", we show an adapted snapshot of the movie at @xmath104 after initialization , which is the time at which the sheath region reaches 1  au . the core and sheath region",
    "are most clearly seen in the large scale quantities ( top row ) , but in particular in the radial velocity data , whereas in most of the quantities more complex structures are visible as well . in general ,",
    "structural variations occur mainly close to or within the elongated core region , while the almost circular sheath region is rather homogeneous in comparison .",
    "the sheath region is characterized by modest enhancements compared to the quiet conditions ( visible beyond @xmath105 1  au ) in density and magnetic field strength , while strong enhancements of @xmath106  km / s and @xmath107  k are found .",
    "the turbulent energy is also increased in this region , and also more so than the magnetic field strength , which follows from the visible enhancements in @xmath64 .",
    "the cross - helicity is slightly reduced , while the correlation length seems to exhibit almost no changes within the sheath region .",
    "+ the core region partly overlaps with the current sheet affected equator .",
    "the current sheet is not ideally resolved , which would require adaptive mesh refinement , which , however , is not yet available in the cronos framework .",
    "therefore , close to the current sheet we get strips of increased or depleted values that are overestimated in this model , but this does not affect the results offset from the equator too much . + while the sheath region is clearly discernible and has the same extent in all quantities , the core region is not similar in all quantities .",
    "the patch containing the highest velocity values reflects different behavior in the other quantities , where basically two regions can be distinguished : on the one hand there is a compression at the leading edge , also towards higher latitudes , with respective elevations in magnetic field strength , density , and turbulent energy , while on the other hand a rarefaction region trails the core , where depleted values are present .",
    "besides these compressional effects there is clearly a distinct band of high turbulent energy due to shear around the edges of the high - speed central region .",
    "respective structures are also visible in the panels for the correlation length and for the cross - helicity , where the latter is generally speaking closer to zero in most parts affected by the cme but also shows some additional structure , probably due to the complex magnetic field geometry .",
    "finally , the panel for @xmath64 reveals enhanced values in the sheath and around the core region , while the rarefaction region exhibits reduced turbulence levels .",
    "the respective effects on the perpendicular and parallel mean free path of energetic particles is twofold , as the former is proportional to @xmath64 , while the latter is antiproportional to it . this can lead to counterintuitive results , where the presence of enhanced turbulence can even facilitate the transport of energetic particles as found by @xcite for cirs .",
    "+ while the meridional slices are symmetric with respect to the equatorial current sheet , this can not be expected for azimuthal slices because of the symmetry breaking in the spiral structure of the magnetic field .",
    "figure [ fig : cme - turb - azim ] shows respective results in azimuthal slices at @xmath108 , where this colatitude is chosen in order to show the behavior not directly at the current sheet , whose influence is overestimated in this model .",
    "these slices are oriented in accordance with the orientation in figure [ fig : cme - para ] . from the field lines shown there ,",
    "it is clear that the magnetic field topology is different at the upper edge of the cme , where the field lines are compressed in a sense according to the initial bending direction of the parker spiral , as compared to the lower edge where field lines are compressed in a sense opposite to the spiral bend .",
    "while many features remain similar to the ones described above for the meridional perspective , there are some additional features due to the symmetry breaking : the core region s tail is bent towards the lower edge , while the sheath region is rather unaffected , i.e.  remains quite symmetric in the hydrodynamic quantites ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) , but as discussed above the magnetic field compression in the sheath region is stronger at the upper edge , which also affects the turbulence quantities : at the upper edge of the core region there is an additional feature of reduced cross - helicity and enhanced turbulence , which is also reflected by a respective feature in temperature , whereas these structures are absent at the lower edge .",
    "a striking azimuthal structure for the diffusion levels is found , as the upper edge of the cme including the sheath region there show relatively small values , while towards the nose and the lower edge the diffusion levels are markedly higher .",
    "this represents an intriguing feature for a subsequent study of energetic particle propagation . + to the best of our knowledge",
    "the observations of turbulence in or associated with cmes are rather limited and use data obtained at 1  au ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the first study that derived quantitative estimates of magnetic turbulence levels near cme fronts was presented by @xcite .",
    "interestingly our findings are within the limits provided by these estimates . +     after cme injection in meridional slices at @xmath103 .",
    "the time evolution as an animation of this figure is available in the supplementary material . ]     after cme injection in azimuthal slices at @xmath108 .",
    "the time evolution as an animation of this figure is available in the supplementary material . ]      in the previous section we described the impact of disturbances in the large - scale flow via a cme on the turbulence quantities .",
    "we now study the effect of the turbulence quantities on the disturbed large scale flow by comparing the simulations discussed above with simulations where the turbulence is switched off , but the remaining setup is maintained .",
    "+ we omit to show 2d slices as above since the results remain remarkably similar .",
    "instead , figure [ fig : cme - comp ] shows radial profiles for the large - scale quantities at @xmath103 and colatitudes of @xmath109 ( solid lines ) and @xmath110 ( dashed lines ) for the case with ( black lines ) and without turbulence ( red lines ) .",
    "the deviations are very small in almost all regions , but a notable difference is the extent of the sheath region , which is marked , e.g. , by the largest temperature values .",
    "the additional heating due to enhanced turbulence there results in a slightly more extended sheath region , but the effect can be considered small enough so that it is negligible for general cme propagation studies .",
    "in this paper we presented our implementation of turbulence transport coupled to the reynolds - averaged ideal mhd equations in the framework of the cronos code .",
    "we followed the work of @xcite and validated our findings by comparing results with these authors findings .",
    "their original model was extended to be applicable to regions of solar wind speeds that do not have to greatly exceed the alfvn speed , which we achieved by simplifying the more general turbulence transport equations of @xcite .",
    "it was shown that beyond radial distances of @xmath111 au the neglect of such terms is usually justified , but including them results in a slower decrease of normalized cross - helicitiy values , i.e.  the generation of backward propagating modes is somewhat inhibited .",
    "this effect is stronger when moving the inner boundary of the simulations closer to the sun , where the alfvn speed is no longer small compared to the solar wind speed .",
    "some additional terms that were inappropriately absent in the @xcite model have also been included in the present work : ( i ) the effect of turbulence driven by shear was introduced via respective ad - hoc terms , whose strength was estimated from comparisons with the work of @xcite .",
    "such an ad - hoc approach has to be taken because the structural similarity assumption , commonly made to achieve closure in the turbulence transport equations , prevents the self - consistent formulation of shear driving .",
    "recently , @xcite removed this constraint by employing an eddy - viscosity approximation , which we plan to include in the future as well .",
    "( ii ) the mixing term @xmath60 was now correctly implemented that results in a ( latitude - dependent ) effect on the normalized cross - helicity , which is now even increasing towards about 10  au , after which turbulence driven by ionization of pick - up ions becomes dominant and results in equipartition between forward and backward propagating modes .",
    "+ while most previous studies of turbulence in the solar wind use prescribed solar wind conditions such as a constant wind speed and a simple parker spiral magnetic field , our approach allows for the self - consistent evolution of turbulence in a time - dependent and disturbed solar wind .",
    "together with our extension towards non - highly - super - alfvnic solar wind speeds , we are therefore able to move the inner boundary of our simulations closer to the sun and consider the effects of transient structures on the turbulence quantities .",
    "while the effect of cirs was already addressed in previous studies @xcite , we concentrate on cmes , here , by using an injection scheme similar to the cone model @xcite , estimating typical cme properties at intermediate solar distances . instead of trying to recreate a specific observed cme , we consider a relatively easy toy - model kind of scenario to study general effects and reserve a more detailed event study with respective comparison to spacecraft data for future work . while the large - scale quantities show typical structures such as a core and sheath region of the cme as found in previous studies ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , here for the first time , we show the respective 3d structure of turbulence quantities of cmes .",
    "these show enhanced turbulence levels and reduced cross - helicity values caused by the cme .",
    "azimuthal symmetry is broken by the disturbed magnetic field and results in azimuthally varying diffusion levels , which will provide an interesting feature to study with energetic particle propagation models .",
    "+ we also investigated possible back reactions of turbulence on the large - scale flow by comparing with identical simulations save for the inclusion of turbulence .",
    "we find a slightly larger cme sheath region due to additional heating via the turbulent cascade , but in general the effect on the propagation of the cme is negligible and , therefore , does not have to be incorporated in models interested in the large - scale flow only .",
    "+ besides the future directions mentioned above , we will in a forthcoming study especially focus on implementing the full set of turbulence transport equations of @xcite , which allow for a variable energy difference @xmath7 ( thus far assumed to be constant ) and different correlation lengths for the forward and backward propagating modes as well as for the energy difference , whereas so far a single correlation length was adopted .",
    "we also plan to explore the possibility to include two component turbulence @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the background solar wind can be modeled more realistically with observationally based boundary conditions derived with the wsa model as reported in our previous work @xcite , with which we will be able to model inner - heliospheric conditions for the background solar wind and associated turbulence . both",
    "can then be directly compared to spacecraft observations and subsequently will serve as input to energetic particle propagation models .",

    "<S> we present the implementation of turbulence transport equations in addition to the reynolds - averaged mhd equations within the cronos framework . </S>",
    "<S> the model is validated by comparisons with earlier findings before it is extended to be applicable to regions in the solar wind that are not highly super - alfvnic . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the respective additional terms result in absolute normalized cross - helicity to decline more slowly , while a proper implementation of the mixing terms can even lead to increased cross - helicities in the inner heliosphere . </S>",
    "<S> + the model extension allows to place the inner boundary of the simulations closer to the sun , where we choose its location at 0.1  au for future application to the wang - sheeley - arge model . here , we concentrate on effects on the turbulence evolution for transient events by injecting a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the steep gradients and shocks associated with these structures result in enhanced turbulence levels and reduced cross - helicity . </S>",
    "<S> our results can now be used straightforwardly for studying the transport of charged energetic particles , where the elements of the diffusion tensor can now benefit from the self - consistently computed solar wind turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that there is no strong back - reaction of the turbulence on the large - scale flow so that cme studies concentrating on the latter need not be extended to include turbulence transport effects . </S>"
