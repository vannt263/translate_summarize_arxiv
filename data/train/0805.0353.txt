    "8 we display the internal energy of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter , for @xmath57 , calculated by the mdim and fp models . in accordance with the case of the free energy , there is a very good agreement in symmetric nuclear matter , but an obvious disagreement is exhibited in pure neutron matter .",
    "the explanation of the agreement in the first case is the same as in the case of the free energy .",
    "the disagreement is due to the completely different behavior of the two models of the nuclear symmetry energy , presented in fig .",

    "10 we plot the thermal energy per particle @xmath175 of @xmath0-stable matter as a function of the baryon density @xmath54 for various values of temperature @xmath58 .",
    "the most striking feature of @xmath176 is that for small values of @xmath58 , the thermal contribution to the internal energy is almost independent of the density @xmath54 . for high values of @xmath58",
    "the situation is different and @xmath176 , for fixed values of @xmath58 , is a decreasing function of the density @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath176 can be decomposed to separate contributions of the kinetic and potential energies as follows : @xmath177 we find that for small values of the baryon density ( i.e. @xmath158 @xmath3 ) the contribution , to @xmath176 of the potential energy @xmath178 is @xmath179 for @xmath180 mev . for medium values of @xmath54 ( i.e. @xmath160 @xmath3 )",
    "is @xmath181 for @xmath180 mev and for higher values ( i.e. @xmath182 @xmath3 ) is @xmath183 for @xmath180 mev .",
    "hence , it is concluded that the potential part of the energy ( as a result of the momentum dependence of the interaction ) contributes significantly to the thermal energy , mainly for small values of @xmath58 ( for fixed values of @xmath54 ) and for large values of @xmath54 ( for fixed values of @xmath58 ) .    at this point , it is worthwhile to compare the results for the pressure obtained by applying eqs .",

    "@xmath188 , in all of the cases , is an increasing function of the baryon density .",
    "the proton fraction affects the reaction rate of neutrino process inside that star .",
    "if a neutron star has a large proton fraction , the cooling rate may drastically change through the high neutrino emissivity due to the direct urca process .",
    "this process can occur if the proton fraction in the matter of a cold neutron star exceeds the critical value of @xmath190-@xmath191 and would lead to the rapid cooling of the neutron star .",
    "thus , it is important to calculate the proton fraction as a function of the baryon density and investigate the temperature effects on that .",
    "13 displays the fractions of protons , electrons and muons as functions of the density , for various values of @xmath58 .",
    "the proton fraction is an increasing function of @xmath58 and this effect is more pronounced for @xmath59 mev .",

    "@xmath193 in fig .",
    "14 we plot the fermi distribution function @xmath194 both for neutrons and protons for various values of @xmath58 .",
    "we observe that the diffuseness of @xmath195 is larger than that of @xmath196 .",
    "we give an explanation ( see also @xcite ) : the ratio of @xmath58 to the fermi kinetic energy @xmath197 is a measure of the thermal effect .",
    "thus by comparing the two ratios we have ( see also appendix ) @xmath198 but , due to @xmath199 , we conclude that we expect the diffuseness to be larger for the proton distribution than for the neutron one , depending of course on the specific value of the ratio @xmath200 .",
    "as we will see later , this fact influences the values of the contributions of protons and neutrons to the total entropy per particle .",
    "the entropy , according to relation ( [ s - den-1 ] ) , is an increasing function of the diffuseness .",
    "thus , the contribution of each species on the total value of the entropy depends strongly on the diffuseness of the corresponding fermi distribution function .",
    "we can provide a second test , concerning the accuracy of the present calculations , by comparing the entropy per baryon calculated by applying eqs .",

    "the main part of the contribution comes from neutrons , whereas the contribution of protons is three times less .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that , in spite of @xmath205 , the approximate relation @xmath206 holds .",
    "this feature is understood by the previous discussion that @xmath195 is diffused more broadly than @xmath196 , so the larger the diffuseness , the larger is the entropy contribution ( see also @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "17 we plot the contribution of the electronic @xmath207 , the muonic @xmath208 and the total ( leptonic ) @xmath209 to the entropy per baryon .",

    "18 we present the eos of the @xmath0-stable hot nuclear matter by taking into account and analyzing the contribution to the total pressure of each component .",
