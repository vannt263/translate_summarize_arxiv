    "the optical emission from low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) is generally dominated by the reprocessing of x - rays in the accretion disk and/or the mass donor ( see van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 for a review ) .",
    "the time history of the optical emission is thus a convolution of the x - ray intensity history with a function representing the spatial distribution of matter in the system .",
    "the most spectacular examples of this phenomenon are the optical novae accompanying soft x - ray transients , which can cause the optical counterpart to brighten by many magnitudes .    of greater interest",
    "are those systems whose x - ray intensity histories are more regularly or sharply modulated .",
    "many lmxbs show periodic optical variability due to orbitally - modulated viewing of the x - ray heated mass donor , providing constraints on the binary inclination and the distribution of reprocessing material in the system ( see van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) at various frequencies have been observed in both the x - ray and optical emission from the candidate black hole binary gx 3394 ( motch , ilovaisky , & chevalier 1982 ; motch et al .",
    "1983 ; imamura et al . 1990 ) .",
    "correlated x - ray and optical bursts have been observed from several systems , and the time delay and smearing of the optical burst profiles with respect to the x - ray bursts have been used to probe the location and distribution of matter near the neutron star ( lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 ) .",

    "the lmxb 4u 162667/kz tra consists of a 7.66 s pulsar accreting from an extremely low - mass companion in an ultracompact binary with a separation of @xmath4  lt - sec ( middleditch et al .",
    "1981 ; levine et al . 1988 ) .",
    "the 7.66 s x - ray pulsations arise due to anisotropic accretion of matter on the surface of a rotating , highly - magnetized neutron star whose spin and magnetic dipole axes are misaligned .",
    "the spin frequency of the pulsar evolves on short ( @xmath5 yr ) time scales due to accretion torques ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "the optical counterpart has a strong ultraviolet excess ( mcclintock et al .",
    "1977 ) , and optical pulsations are detected with the same frequency as the x - ray pulsations ( ilovaisky et al .",
    "the optical emission is understood as primarily due to reprocessing of the incident x - ray flux by material in the accretion disk and/or the binary companion s surface ( chester 1979 ; mcclintock et al .",

    "1985 ) .",
    "high - sensitivity timing of the optical pulsations detected an additional weak , persistent pulsation in a lower - frequency sideband of the `` direct '' ( x - ray ) pulse frequency ( middleditch et al .",
    "this sideband was attributed to x - ray reprocessing on the surface of the companion , so that the 0.4 mhz downshift is due to the different effective pulsar rotation rate observed in the companion frame due to the binary orbit .",
    "the observed frequency shift implies a 42-min prograde orbit .",
    "x - ray timing measurements have repeatedly failed to detect periodic pulse arrival time delays or pulse frequency shifts due to a binary orbit , yielding an upper limit of @xmath8 lt - ms for the projected radius of the neutron star orbit ( levine et al .",

    "high speed multicolor optical photometry of 4u 162667/kz tra was obtained on ut 1995 may 2628 ( mjd 4986349865 ) with the 4-m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in la serena , chile .",
    "the observations used the automated single channel aperture photometer ( ascap ) and a dry - ice - cooled varian vpm-159a photomultiplier tube at the @xmath10 ritchey - chretien focus , along with the _ ubvri _ filter set described by graham ( 1982 ) .",
    "the varian phototube , which has an ingaasp photocathode , is sensitive over a wide wavelength range , with a quantum efficiency of 15% at 4000    and 5% at 9000   .",
    "all the observations were made through a 6.6  arcsec circular aperture .",
    "the data were recorded at 1 ms resolution and rebinned to 100 ms resolution for timing analysis .",
    "a log of the long timing observations of 4u 162667 is given in table 1 .",
    "typical target and sky count rates are given in table 2 .",
    "the graham ( 1982 ) photometric standard star e7-s was also observed at various airmasses on each night as a calibration source .",
    "timing stability was maintained using a kinemetrics truetime 468-dc goes satellite synchronized clock .",
    "this clock was synchronized using nist timing signals transmitted via the noaa _ geostationary operational environmental satellite 7 ( goes / west ) _ , located in geostationary orbit at 135@xmath11 west longitude ( beehler & lombardi 1990 ) .",
    "the signals were corrected for the 267 ms mean path delay from the noaa ground station at wallops island , virginia up to _ goes / west _ and down to the ctio receiver ( corresponding to a setting of 57 ms for the propagation delay switch on the clock ) . according to the manufacturer specifications , the clock in this configuration maintains absolute time accuracy within @xmath12  ms of utc(nist ) .",
    "however , an independent check of this accuracy ( e.g. , a cross - check with a global positioning system timing signal or optical pulse timing of a well - established astrophysical time standard like the crab pulsar ) was not available during these observations .    some of the long timing observations contained a strong instrumental signal at 60 hz and its higher harmonics in the 1 ms data ( see table 1 ) .",
    "whenever the 60 hz signal was present , it was accompanied by a second strong signal at 1.75 hz and its higher harmonics , and the two signals beat against each other .",
    "these high frequency contaminants appeared intermittently in observations of several different targets .",
    "however , their presence did not affect any of the science analysis for 4u 162667 , all of which was confined to pulse frequencies below 1 hz .",
    "absolute photometry of 4u 162667 on may 26 yielded the following magnitude and colors : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the individual magnitudes are given in table 2 .",
    "the @xmath17-band sky background observation was too short to allow determination of a reliable source magnitude , but the presence of 7.66-s @xmath17-band pulsations , in phase with those in the bluer bands ( see below ) , confirms that the source was detected in the @xmath17-band as well . assuming that the @xmath17-band pulsed fraction is also 6% ( as in the other optical bands ; see below ) , the source has @xmath18 . within the uncertainties ,",
    "interstellar reddening can be neglected for this high latitude source , since the total galactic reddening in the direction of 4u 162667 is @xmath19 ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) .",
    "the @xmath20 magnitudes reported here are virtually identical to those measured on 1977 june 12 by mcclintock et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , and they agree within 2@xmath21 with those measured on 1977 august 17 by grindlay ( 1978 ) . however , the present @xmath22-band measurement is 1.8(4 ) magnitudes brighter than previously reported by grindlay ( 1978 ) .",
    "the observed time series were transformed to the solar system barycenter frame using the jet propulsion laboratory de-200 solar system ephemeris ( standish et al .",
    "power spectra of the individual observations in all five bands showed strong 7.66 s pulsations , with a mean barycentric pulse frequency of 130.4398(7 ) mhz .",
    "this is consistent with the x - ray pulsation frequency measured at the midpoint of the ctio observations by the batse all - sky monitor on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _",
    "( chakrabarty et al . 1997 ) . to facilitate a study of the pulse shape and phase relationship of the optical pulsations at different wavelengths ,",
    "a precise pulse phase ephemeris was derived from a subset of the batse observations ( 1995 may 9  1995 june 11 ) contemporaneous with the ctio observations .",
    "based on these data , the barycentric x - ray pulse phase during the ctio observations is well fit by @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25  hz , @xmath26 hz s@xmath3 , @xmath27 1995 may 27.5 tdb , and pulse phase is defined relative to the intensity minimum of the fundamental harmonic of the 2060 kev batse pulse profile .",
    "the ctio timing observations for each of the five filters were folded according to the timing model in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the resulting pulse profiles , along with the batse 2060 kev pulse profile , are shown in figure 1 relative to the batse pulse phase .",
    "the mean optical pulse and the batse hard x - ray pulse agree in phase to within 5% ( i.e. , a relative time delay of @xmath28 s ) , consistent with previous measurements ( mcclintock et al .",
    "both the batse hard x - ray pulse and the optical pulse shapes have a dominant sinusoidal component , although the optical pulses clearly have additional harmonic content as well .",
    "the optical pulse shapes do not resemble any of the x - ray pulse shapes in the 213 kev range , all of which have an unusual and distinctive close double - peak structure ( levine et al .",
    "instead , the optical pulse shapes resemble the low - energy ( 12 kev ) and high - energy ( 1560 kev ) pulse shapes .",
    "this is consistent with previous observations by mcclintock et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , who concluded that the 12 kev x - rays were chiefly responsible for the reprocessed optical emission .",
    "the pulsed fraction , independent of wavelength , is approximately 6% ( see table 2 ) , suggesting that the optical emission is dominated by x - ray reprocessing .",
    "figure  2 shows the fourier power spectrum of a 2-hour @xmath29-band observation ( run 15u ) .",
    "the spectrum has been rebinned into uniform logarithmic frequency intervals , the mean noise level due to poisson counting statistics subtracted off , and the power level normalized relative to the double - sided mean source power ( e.g. , miyamoto et al .",
    "in addition to the 130 mhz pulsation , a 0.048 hz qpo was also detected .",
    "this feature was fit with a lorentzian profile ( e.g. , shibazaki & lamb 1987 ) , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the centroid frequency of the qpo and @xmath32 is its full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the fractional root - mean - squared ( rms ) amplitude of the qpo was computed by integrating equation ( [ eq - qpo ] ) over the fwhm of the feature and taking the square root , yielding 3.4% for this observation .",
    "the qpo is also detected in the @xmath33 and @xmath22-band observations .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the qpo features are included in table 2 .",
    "these measurements provide the first detection of an optical qpo from an x - ray pulsar .",
    "a similar feature is observed at x - ray wavelengths ( shinoda et al .",
    "1990 ; angelini et al . 1995 ; chakrabarty et al .",
    "1997 , in preparation ) . for comparison ,",
    "the fourier power spectrum of the 26 kev data from a 71 ks observation of 4u 162667 with the proportional counter array on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ is shown in figure  3 .",
    "this observation was made on 1996 february 11 .",
    "the qpo is clearly visible in the x - ray data with an rms strength of 6% , along with several harmonics of the coherent 7.66 s pulsation .",
    "( the higher harmonics are very strong due to the very sharp 26 kev x - ray pulse shape of 4u 162667 . )",
    "the _ rxte _ data will be discussed in further detail elsewhere ( chakrabarty et al . 1997 , in preparation ) .    to study the detailed structure of the optical timing properties close to the pulsation frequency ,",
    "an overresolved power spectrum was constructed by computing the fourier power @xmath34 at fractional bin intervals according to @xmath35 with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is just the original time series @xmath38 multiplied by complex phase factors @xmath39 .",
    "note that while the @xmath40 shifted power spectrum bins @xmath41 are statistically independent of each other , they are _ not _ independent of the original power spectrum @xmath42 ( although the covariances are easily computed ; see , e.g. , jenkins & watts 1968 ) . generalizing this process , one can construct an @xmath43-times overresolved power spectrum by interleaving the bins from the original power spectrum and @xmath44 frequency - shifted power spectra . operationally , this is equivalent to padding the original @xmath40-point zero - mean time series with @xmath45 zeros and computing the power spectrum of the new @xmath46-point padded time series .",
    "use of an oversampled power spectrum gives more uniform frequency sensitivity at the expense of independent frequency bins , recovering fourier phase information which is normally lost when constructing the power spectrum from the fourier amplitudes .",
    "figure 4 shows a 5-times overresolved power spectrum of 4u 162667 in the immediate vicinity of the main pulsation .",
    "the power spectrum has been normalized relative to the mean noise power . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "the power spectrum shown is the average of power spectra from three separate 1.8-hr observations ( runs 15u , 17b , and 23r ) . in addition to the fundamental pulsation at 130.4398(37 )",
    "mhz , several other features are present . in considering these features , it is important to recall that the peaks due to periodic signals in a finite - length power spectrum are always accompanied by sidelobes .",
    "this can be understood by considering a finite time series as the product of an infinite data stream and a rectangular ( boxcar ) observation window function ( equal to unity during the observation and zero elsewhere ) . by the fourier convolution theorem ,",
    "the fourier transform of this product is equal to the convolution of the fourier transforms of the infinite data stream and the observation window function ( e.g. , press et al .",
    "thus the power at frequency @xmath47 due to a sinusoidal signal with frequency @xmath48 in an ungapped observation of length @xmath49 is @xmath50 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the power at the signal frequency .",
    "the dotted curve in figure 4 shows the fit of this function to the data ( with the expected mean noise level of unity added ) , assuming that @xmath52 mhz corresponds to the main pulsation peak .",
    "the expected sidelobe structure almost exactly accounts for the two symmetric sidelobes on either side of the main peak .",
    "however , after accounting for the expected sidelobe structure of the main pulsation , a residual power excess is clearly evident at @xmath53 mhz , downshifted 0.395(15 ) mhz from the main pulsation peak .",
    "this is consistent with the 0.4011(21 ) mhz shift for the lower sideband reported by middleditch ( 1981 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the sideband relative to the main pulsation is 25% ( compared to 20% measured by middleditch et al .",
    "1981 ) , corresponding to a sideband pulsed fraction of 1.5% . to evaluate the statistical significance of this excess power , note that the powers in an average of three background - dominated power spectra obey ( within a constant scaling factor ) a @xmath54-distribution with six degrees of freedom . for a power spectrum",
    "normalized such that the mean noise power is unity , the probability of a noise fluctuation in a single bin exceeding a threshold power @xmath55 is @xmath56 thus , the observed excess power of 5.9 has a probability of @xmath57 of being due to a random fluctuation , making it significant at the 4.6@xmath21 level .",
    "accounting for the fact that all bins in the range 0.1290.132 hz were searched reduces the statistical significance to 4.0@xmath21 .",
    "it is especially striking to note that the frequency _ shift _ of the sideband agrees with that reported by middleditch et al .",
    "( 1981 ) despite the fact that the actual value of the main pulsation frequency ( corresponding to the pulsar s spin ) has changed from 130.26 mhz to 130.44 mhz in the 15 years between the two observations ( chakrabarty et al . 1997 ) .",
    "our sideband detection strongly corroborates the 42-min binary period reported by middleditch et al .",
    "unfortunately , the signal - to - noise ratio of this detection is insufficient to permit a more detailed investigation of the binary parameters .",
    "qpos in accretion - powered pulsars are widely believed to arise from interactions between the pulsar magnetosphere and the inner edge of an accretion disk . in the beat frequency model ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1985 ) , the qpo arises when inhomogeneous `` clumps '' of material at the inner edge of the disk are captured by the magnetosphere and accreted by the pulsar , producing a broad power spectral feature at the beat frequency @xmath58 between the keplerian frequency at the inner disk edge and the pulsar s spin frequency .",
    "[ an alternative explanation , the keplerian frequency model of van der klis et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , predicts @xmath59 .",
    "however , it can only explain qpos where @xmath60 , and thus is not applicable in 4u 162667 .",
    "] thus , the 0.048 hz x - ray qpo in 4u 162667 bolsters the premise that this is a disk - fed binary .",
    "the discovery of an optical qpo at the same frequency shows that a significant fraction of the optical luminosity from the binary simply mirrors the x - ray emission , and must therefore result from x - ray reprocessing . as noted by middleditch et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , the existence of two distinct , persistent , coherent optical pulsation frequencies suggests that the reprocessing occurs in two separate sites , most likely the surface of the mass donor and the accretion disk .",
    "simultaneous x - ray and optical timing of these pulsations and the qpo may therefore provide a powerful probe of the geometry of the binary and physics of the accretion disk ( e.g. , arons & king 1993 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the batse hard x - ray measurements acquired simultaneously with the optical observations require @xmath61 d to detect the x - ray pulsations , making them useless for a correlative study on short time scales . however , more sensitive x - ray timing missions ( e.g. _ rxte _ ) are well suited to such a task if the observations can be coordinated with ground - based optical observations .",
    "a comparison of figures 2 and 3 gives a flavor of the kind of data sets that can be directly intercompared if measured simultaneously .",
    "ultraviolet timing observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ may also provide an important probe , as the reprocessing in the disk should be more efficient at these wavelengths than in the optical ( arons & king 1993 ; anderson et al .",
    "more generally , time - resolved ultraviolet / optical / infrared photometry may provide an important test for candidate multiwavelength counterparts in time - variable lmxbs whose companions remain unidentified .",
    "while x - ray binaries and cataclysmic variables with a hydrogen - rich mass donor can not reach orbital periods @xmath62 min ( paczynski & sienkiewicz 1981 ) , those with a hydrogen - depleted mass donor can evolve to extraordinarily short ( @xmath6310 min ) orbital periods while maintaining high mass transfer rates ( nelson , rappaport , & joss 1986 ) .",
    "few such systems are known , including the six am cvn cataclysmic variables ( see warner 1995 ) and the x - ray bursters 4u  182030 ( @xmath64 min ) and 4u  191605 ( @xmath65 min ) .",
    "the recently reported 20.6-min ultraviolet modulation in the x - ray burster 4u 1850087 is probably due to the same phenomenon ( homer et al .",
    "1996 ) . with a 42-min binary period ,",
    "4u 162667 is clearly a member of this class as well ( levine et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "in addition to the inferred 42-min binary period , there are several other constraints on scenarios for the mass donor in 4u 162667 . the stringent x - ray timing limit ( @xmath66 lt - ms ; levine et al .",
    "1988 ; shinoda et al .",
    "1990 ) on the projected radius of the pulsar orbit implies @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mass ratio , @xmath69 is the companion mass , @xmath70 is the neutron star mass @xmath71 in units of @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the binary period in units of 42 min .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability of observing a system within the inclination limit @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 .",
    "a second constraint is the assumption that the mass transfer in an ultracompact binary is driven by angular momentum losses via gravitational radiation ( e.g. , levine et al .",
    ". the resulting mass transfer rate will be ( e.g. , verbunt & van den heuvel 1995 and references therein ) @xmath76 where @xmath43 is the power - law exponent in the companion s mass - radius relation ( @xmath77 ) , and conservative mass transfer via roche lobe overflow has been assumed . since the bolometric x - ray flux from 4u 162667 has been measured ( @xmath78 erg @xmath79 s@xmath3 in the 0.560 kev band ; pravdo et al .",
    "1979 ) , this also constrains the source distance and x - ray luminosity @xmath80 , where @xmath81 km is the neutron star radius and @xmath82 is the distance to the source .",
    "another constraint is a lower limit on @xmath83 from the observed spin history of the pulsar ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "if the pulsar is spinning up , then the maximum possible accretion torque on the neutron star will occur when the magnetospheric radius @xmath84 ( where the magnetic energy density is comparable to the kinetic energy density of the accreting matter ) is close to the corotation radius @xmath85 ( where the magnetic field lines move with the local disk velocity ) .",
    "this limit may be written as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 for a keplerian disk .",
    "however , the torque on the neutron star can be rewritten as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the pulsar s moment of inertia ( ravenhall & pethick 1994 ) and @xmath90 is the spin frequency derivative  a directly measurable quantity . noting that @xmath91 hz s@xmath3 was measured during the spin - up of 4u 162667 , chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 1997 ) thus inferred that @xmath92 yr@xmath3 .",
    "given the measured x - ray flux , the @xmath83 limit requires @xmath93 kpc . in view of the source s high galactic latitude ( @xmath94 ) ,",
    "the resulting distance out of the plane is also a consideration when contemplating mass donors .",
    "however , this need nt be a strong consideration , since it is plausible for neutron star lmxbs to have high velocities due to a supernova `` kick '' , leading to a considerable distance from the plane over the long x - ray lifetime of the source . indeed , the high - latitude ( @xmath95 ) lmxb pulsar her x-1/hz her is @xmath96 kpc distant , over 4 kpc out of the plane ( reynolds et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the possible types of roche - lobe - filling mass donor for 4u 162667 have been discussed previously by levine et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and verbunt , wijers , & burm ( 1990 ) .",
    "i review and update those discussions here .",
    "there are three possible types of roche - lobe - filling donors for a 42-min neutron star binary .",
    "the first possibility is a @xmath97 helium or carbon - oxygen white dwarf . from equation ( [ eq - incl ] )",
    ", the binary inclination for this case must be @xmath98 , with an _ a priori _ observation probability of 16% .",
    "the mass - radius relation for such a star is @xmath99 ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , so the mass transfer rate from equation ( [ eq - mdot ] ) is @xmath100 yr@xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of about 1 kpc .",
    "although the this case has the most favorable inclination constraint of the roche - lobe - filling options ( due to the extremely small @xmath69 ) , the mass transfer rate driven by gravitational radiation alone is an order of magnitude below the minimum mass accretion rate inferred by chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the second roche - lobe - filling possibility is a @xmath101 hydrogen - depleted star which is not fully degenerate , with @xmath102 and an _ a priori _ probability of 1% . assuming @xmath103 , equation ( [ eq - mdot ] )",
    "gives @xmath104 yr@xmath3 , corresponding to a distance of 3 kpc .",
    "these are identical to the lower limits on @xmath83 and @xmath82 inferred from the pulsar spin - up measurements , and thus are just consistent with the observations .",
    "finally , a @xmath105 roche - lobe - filling helium - burning star is also a possible donor for a 42-min neutron star binary .",
    "however , the small allowed inclination range ( @xmath106 ) has an _ a priori _ observation probability of only 0.03% , and the expected mass transfer rate ( @xmath107 yr@xmath3 ; savonije , de kool , & van den heuvel 1986 ) would require an unphysically large distance ( 36 kpc ) to be consistent with the observed x - ray flux .",
    "angelini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have proposed an alternative to a roche - lobe - filling donor .",
    "these authors detected an unusually strong complex of neon emission lines in the x - ray spectrum of 4u  162667 . since neon is a product of helium burning , angelini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggest that the mass donor is a helium - burning star which underfills its roche lobe , transferring matter to the neutron star via a radiatively - driven wind .",
    "this possibility is of particular interest given the suggestion that the current spin - down of the pulsar is due to accretion from a retrograde disk ( nelson et al .",
    "1997 ) , since formation of such a disk is much more plausible for wind accretion than for roche lobe overflow .",
    "however , the wind from a low - mass helium - burning star would not provide a high enough mass transfer rate to be consistent with the x - ray data , as is now shown .",
    "a mass of @xmath108 is required for core helium burning ( kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) .",

    "more generally , helium - burning donors with @xmath113 would underfill the roche lobe and be consistent with or fainter than the optical measurements for somewhat larger distances , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 k. assuming a radiatively - driven wind similar to that observed in other hot stars , the wind mass loss rate with these parameters would be @xmath116 yr@xmath3 ( abbott 1982 ) . especially in light of the poor accretion efficiency expected for a wind - fed system ( @xmath117 ; e.g. , frank , king , & raine 1992 ) , this is several orders of magnitude too small to be consistent with the minimum accretion rate , @xmath118 yr@xmath3 .",
    "similar considerations seem to rule out any plausible donor transferring matter via a conventional radiatively - driven wind . on the other hand",
    ", a self - excited wind arising from x - ray heating of the mass donor might be a significant contributor to the mass transfer rate , whether or not the donor fills its roche lobe ( see tavani & london 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider whether a stellar spectrum can explain the optical photometry .",
    "the data can in fact be well fit by a single - temperature ( stellar ) blackbody spectrum , @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the flux density from the star per unit frequency @xmath47 , @xmath121 is the stellar radius , @xmath82 is the source distance , @xmath122 erg s is planck s constant , @xmath123 is the velocity of light , @xmath124 erg k@xmath3 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath125 is the effective temperature of the star .",

    "a hydrogen - burning star with the correct temperature ( a main sequence or supergiant b star ) is obviously excluded both by the absurd ( @xmath129 kpc ) distance required and the infinitesimal _ a priori _ probability for the necessary binary inclination .",
    "a @xmath130 he - ms star with @xmath131 kpc would have the correct temperature and flux .",
    "however , as noted above , it would severely underfill its roche lobe and so probably could not transfer sufficient mass to the pulsar to explain the observed x - ray flux .",
    "in addition , the implied binary inclination for a 42-min orbit has an a priori probability of @xmath132 0.1% .",
    "however , assuming a typical white dwarf mass - radius relation , @xmath133 ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , we find @xmath134 kpc for a @xmath97 white dwarf .",
    "as noted above , such a star would just fill its roche lobe , and the expected mass transfer rate would be consistent with the observed x - ray flux . for such a close binary , x - ray heating would certainly dominate the intrinsic luminosity of the degenerate dwarf .",

    "thus , x - ray heating of a low mass wd would naively seem to provide a plausible model for the observed optical emission .",
    "unfortunately , this is an unrealistic model .",
    "the 0.04 hz qpo detected in the x - ray and optical data underscores the presence of an accretion disk ( e.g. , van der klis 1995 ) which must contribute significant optical luminosity . the flux from a geometrically thin , optically thick disk can be written as @xmath139 - 1},\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is the disk s surface temperature as a function of mid - plane radius @xmath141 .",
    "given the x - ray timing limits , it is clear that @xmath142 .",

    "the inner accretion disk should be disrupted by the pulsar s magnetosphere at roughly the neutron star s corotation radius , @xmath145 cm for a keplerian disk .",
    "( strictly speaking , @xmath85 is an upper limit on @xmath146 , but the calculation is not sensitive to this quantity since most of the disk s optical emission comes from its outer parts . ) for an x - ray heated disk , the disk may be considered as consisting of up to three distinct regions : an innermost region powered primarily by internal viscous dissipation , a middle region of `` shallow '' x - ray heating , and an outer region of `` deep '' x - ray heating ( e.g. , cunningham 1976 ; arons & king 1993 ) .",
    "let us consider each of these regions in turn .",
    "the standard temperature profile for an unirradiated thin accretion disk is set by internal viscous dissipation ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; frank et al .",
    "1992 ) @xmath147 where @xmath148 erg @xmath79 k@xmath149 s@xmath3 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath70 is the neutron star mass in units of 1.4 @xmath150 , @xmath151 is the mass accretion rate in units of @xmath152  yr@xmath3 , and @xmath153 is the mid - plane radius in units of @xmath154 cm . at sufficiently small radii , this internal heating will dominate over x - ray heating in setting the disk temperature . beyond a critical radius ,",
    "however , x - ray heating of the disk surface will modify the temperature profile according to @xmath155 assuming that the disk is irradiated by a central x - ray point source , then we can write @xmath156 as @xmath157^{1/4 } \\approx \\left[\\frac{l_x(1-\\eta_d ) }     { 4\\pi\\sigma r^2 } \\left(\\frac{dh}{dr } - \\frac{h}{r}\\right)\\right]^{1/4 } , \\label{eq - tx}\\ ] ] where @xmath158 is the x - ray albedo of the disk , @xmath159 is the angle between the normal to the disk surface and the vector from the neutron star , and @xmath160 is the disk s scale height .",
    "thus , we see that the temperature profile due to x - ray heating is sensitive to the functional form of @xmath161 through the approximation for @xmath162 ( which assumes @xmath163 ) .    in the shallow x - ray heating region ,",
    "the surface temperature profile is set by x - ray heating but the _ central _ temperature of the disk is still set by internal viscous dissipation .",
    "thus , the disk thickness has the usual value for a standard unirradiated thin disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; frank et al .",
    "1992 ) , @xmath164 where @xmath165 is an order unity dimensionless parametrization of the kinematic viscosity @xmath166 , @xmath167 is the isothermal sound speed , and @xmath168 is the mean molecular weight in units of the hydrogen atomic mass .",
    "( note that @xmath169 for neutral hydrogen , 1/2 for ionized hydrogen , 4 for neutral helium , 2 for singly - ionized helium , and 4/3 for doubly - ionized helium . )",
    "we thus find @xmath170 shallow x - ray heating will dominate internal viscous heating in setting the disk surface temperature when @xmath171 , which occurs at radii exceeding roughly @xmath172 cm .",
    "if @xmath173 , then x - ray heating will also dominate internal heating in setting the _ central _ temperature of the disk ( lyutyi & sunyaev 1976 ; spruit 1995 ) . here",
    ", @xmath174 is the disk s optical depth , given by @xmath175 for a standard @xmath165-disk ( frank et al .",
    "1992 ) . in this region of deep x - ray heating",
    ", the vertical structure of the disk will not obey the @xmath176 relationship in equation ( [ eq - h98 ] ) , but will instead follow a @xmath177 power law ( e.g. , cunningham 1976 ; vrtilek et al . 1990 ;",
    "arons & king 1993 )",
    ". however , deep x - ray heating will dominate over shallow heating only for radii exceeding roughly @xmath178 cm . in a binary",
    "as compact as 4u 162667 , the disk will terminate before deep heating becomes dominant , so that a combination of internal viscous heating and shallow x - ray heating [ equation ( 12 ) along with equations ( 11 ) and ( 15 ) ] should be valid over the entire disk .",
    "accounting for the presence of an x - ray heated accretion disk , it is clear that an x - ray heated low - mass white dwarf at a distance of 1 kpc is untenable for 4u 162667 , since the expected optical emission from the disk would be considerably brighter than the measured fluxes . instead , it is more appropriate to consider the opposite case of the disk providing most of the optical luminosity by fitting equations ( 10 ) and ( 12 ) along with equations ( 11 ) and ( 15 ) to the measured optical photometry .",
    "the free parameters for the fit are @xmath82 ( or , equivalently , @xmath179 ) and @xmath158 .",
    "as is evident from figure 5 , the x - ray heated disk model can easily fit the data .",
    "however , as shown in figure 6 , the optical data do not provide a strong joint constraint on @xmath82 and @xmath158 .",
    "ultraviolet observations will eventually provide a much stronger constraint , since the uv spectrum from an x - ray heated disk is much more sensitive to the values of @xmath179 and @xmath158 . in the absence of ultraviolet observations",
    ", it should be noted that de jong , van paradijs , & augusteijn ( 1996 ) have concluded that lmxb accretion disks have a very high effective x - ray albedo ( @xmath180 ) , based on observations of 4u  125469 , 4u  175533 , and sco  x-1 .",
