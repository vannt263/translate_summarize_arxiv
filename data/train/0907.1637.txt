    "graphene - based systems have recently attracted much attention from both the experimental and the theoretical point of view .",
    "graphene is in fact characterized by a high carrier - mobility , @xcite which make those systems very exciting in view of future applications in nanoelectronics . in standard experimental setups ,",
    "few - layers graphene ( flg ) interacts with the environment through doping charges coming from the top ( @xmath0 ) and from the bottom ( @xmath1 ) of the system .",
    "these charges determine the external electric field @xmath2 $ ] and the total electron concentration ( @xmath3 ) . @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath5 can thus be varied independently changing the charges from the two sides . @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "can be intentionally induced by applying gate voltage differences between the system and the substrate , or via atoms / molecules deposition on top of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "important unintentional doping charges are typically present .",
    "for instance , in flg obtained by exfoliation on @xmath6 @xcite or epitaxially grown on sic , @xcite a charge transfer occurs between the substrate and the system , giving rise to a finite @xmath1 . in analogy",
    ", an additional @xmath0 can be accidentally induced by the uncontrolled adsorption of molecules from the atmosphere .    among flg ,",
    "the bilayer graphene is particularly interesting because it becomes a tunable band - gap semiconductor under the application of an electric field perpendicular to the system .",
    "@xcite in this context , the determination of the electric field is crucial in order to control the band - gap .",
    "moreover , in graphene charge impurities originating from the top or from the substrate are the main source of scattering which reduces conduction performances .",
    "@xcite therefore , the determination of the charge transfer from the substrate or from the atmosphere is highly desirable for possible applications .",
    "although experimental techniques allow to estimate the total electron concentration on the system , an accurate determination of the respective values of top and bottom charges has never been achieved so far , and can be particularly challenging , for instance , when doping is intentionally induced by deposition of molecules or polymeric electrolyte . in this work we use a tight binding ( tb ) model fitted on ab initio calculations to compute the raman shift , broadening , and relative raman intensity of the @xmath7 modes in bilayer graphene , as a function of the electron concentration , for different values of top charges .",
    "in particular , the screening properties of the system in presence of an external electric field are described using ab initio density functional theory calculations ( dft ) , including the @xmath8 correction , while a tb model is used to reproduce the dft calculated , @xmath8 corrected , band structure in the full brillouin zone .",
    "we show that from the measured raman spectra of bilayer graphene it is possible to determine the external charge distribution and thus the external electric field and the actual carriers concentration .",
    "this result is especially relevant since it shows that raman spectroscopy , which is already widely used to investigate graphene - based systems , can be used to characterize the electrostatic environment of the sample .",
    "moreover , since the charges coming from the atmosphere and the substrate are not expected to depend on the number of layers , raman measurements on bilayer graphene can also be used to determine the origin and the amount of the unintentional doping of monolayer and few - layers graphene in the same environment .",
    "the raman spectra of monolayer graphene are characterized by a doubly - degenerate @xmath7 peak ( @xmath9 mode ) at around 1580 @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite this mode shows a strong electron - phonon coupling , which induces a phonon renormalization when @xmath5 is varied .",
    "therefore , raman can be used to measure the total electron concentration . in bilayer graphene , in the absence of an external electric field the @xmath7 peak splits , as in graphite , in a doubly - degenerate raman active mode ( @xmath9 ) and a doubly - degenerate , raman inactive , infra - red active mode ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the @xmath9 mode is characterized by a symmetric in - phase displacement of the atoms in the two layers ( fig.[raman - ir]-a ) , whereas @xmath11 is characterized by an antisymmetric out - of - phase displacement of those atoms ( fig.[raman - ir]-b ) .",
    "most raman measurements on bilayer graphene show a single @xmath7 peak whose position is used , as in monolayer graphene , to measure the electron concentration on the system .",
    "@xcite interestingly , the splitting of the @xmath7 peak has been observed in the raman spectra of bilayer graphene , @xcite and it has been recently attributed to symmetry breaking due to the application of an external electric field.@xcite moreover , other experimental works recently reported on the infra - red spectra of gated bilayer graphene .",
    "@xcite these findings suggest that a deep understanding of the behavior of a splitted @xmath7 mode in gated bilayer graphene could lead to quantify not only the total electron concentration @xmath5 but also the separate values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "( a ) and the raman inactive mode @xmath11 ( b ) in bilayer graphene . a , b are the inequivalent carbon atoms in the top layer , a and b are the inequivalent carbon atoms in the bottom layer . in a bernal stacking configuration ,",
    "a and a are the superposed atoms . ]",
    "in order to calculate the electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) component of the phonon frequencies , broadenings , and relative raman intensities as functions of @xmath5 and @xmath0 , we consider the @xmath12 phonon self - energy , @xcite projected onto the subspace of the two @xmath9 and the two @xmath11 modes : @xmath13 where the sum is on the electron wave vector @xmath14 and the electronic @xmath15 bands @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17=1,4 are the phonon indexes , @xmath18 is the number of @xmath14 vectors , and @xmath19 is the occupation of the electron state @xmath20 with energy @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the epc and @xmath23 is the hamiltonian derivative with respect to the atomic displacement corresponding to the @xmath24 phonon .",
    "@xmath25 equals 0.009 ev and m is the atomic mass .    from the phonon",
    "self - energy one can calculate only frequency variations due to changes in the electron concentration and in the band structure . in order to obtain the absolute frequencies we use the following 4@xmath26 matrix : @xmath27 where @xmath28=1581.5 @xmath10 is the experimentally measured frequency of the raman active @xmath7 peak in bilayer graphene , in absence of doping and electric field .",
    "@xcite @xmath29 is the contribution to the broadening of the @xmath7 modes in graphene and graphite from the anharmonic phonon - phonon interaction , whose value is estimated to be 1.8 @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite @xmath30 is the phonon self - energy of the doubly degenerate @xmath9 mode calculated for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and it is given by @xmath33 $ ] , where @xmath34 corresponds to the two @xmath9 modes and @xmath35 are the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "in presence of doping charge the lattice parameter changes and the corresponding variation of the @xmath7 modes frequencies can be obtained for zero electric field by ab initio calculations:@xcite @xmath36  @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the relative variation of the lattice parameter , as in eq.(2 ) of ref.@xcite in this work we do not include in the phonon calculations the effects due to direct interaction of the system with adsorbates and with the substrate donating doping charge . however , as shown for intercalated graphite,@xcite we assume that this is not relevant also for the in - plane vibrational modes of bilayer graphene .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath39 are of the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the frequency of phonon @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) , given by the epc and the anharmonic phonon - phonon interaction . in the general case of finite @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath0 the four eigenmodes of @xmath39 , @xmath44 , are still two by two degenerate , but they are a superposition of the @xmath9 and @xmath45 eigenmodes of the unbiased bilayer graphene .",
    "their relative raman intensities @xmath46 are calculated as : @xmath47 where @xmath48=1 .",
    "we have shown that the screening properties of bilayer graphene under the application of an external electric field are characterized by inter- and intra - layer polarizations.@xcite most of the calculations of the band gap as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath0 are based on tb models,@xcite which usually consider only the inter - layer palarization , resulting in an overestimation of the band gap . in the present work the band structure of the @xmath15 electrons [ @xmath21 and @xmath20 in eq.([epc ] ) ]",
    "is obtained using the scheme presented in ref.@xcite the band gap is computed by ab initio dft calculations , including the @xmath8 corrections , and both inter- and intra - layer polarizations are fully taken into account .",
    "the full band structure of gated bilayer graphene is then computed using a tb model , which is able to reproduce all the important features of the dft calculated , @xmath8 corrected bands , including the electron - hole asymmetry .    in order to compute @xmath23",
    "one needs to calculate the derivative of the tight binding hamiltonian with respect to the atomic positions .",
    "however , only the variation of the first nearest - neighbors in - plane hopping parameters @xmath49 turns out to be relevant , and this only term is thus included in @xmath23 .",
    "the value we use for this quantity is 5.8 ev @xmath50 , which derives from the ab initio gw - calculated epc at @xmath12 for the @xmath9 mode in monolayer graphene .",
    "and for @xmath51 . calculated values of the shifts are connected by lines . for a given value of @xmath5 ( panel a ) or @xmath0 ( panel b ) there are two phonon modes represented with two rectangles .",
    "the height of the rectangles is the fwhm and the areas are proportional to the relative raman intensities ( i.e. the integrated area of each peak ) of the two modes .",
    "thus , the ratio of the widths of the two rectangles is equal to the ratio of the maximum heights of the two raman peaks .",
    "when the ratio is less than 0.1 , the mode with the smallest intensity is colored in gray ( red ) , otherwise is black .",
    "circles are experimental results from ref.@xcite and the errorbars represent the experimental fwhm . ]    , for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "see the caption of fig.[shift ] . ]    in fig.[shift]-a we show the calculated raman shift as a function of @xmath5 , for the case @xmath0=@xmath1 , where the external electric field and the band - gap are kept fixed to zero , as theoretically studied in ref.@xcite in this case the @xmath9 and @xmath45 modes do not mix by symmetry .",
    "analogously to monolayer graphene , the raman active modes show a singularity when the fermi energy is half of the phonon energy . in fig.[shift]-b",
    "we show the calculated raman shifts for the case @xmath51 , as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this is a special situation where the external electric field is varied while @xmath5 is kept fixed to zero , as realized in recent infra - red experiments .",
    "@xcite in this case , the mixing between @xmath9 and @xmath45 modes is weak due to the antisymmetric allocation of charges in the two layers .",
    "the raman active modes show a singularity in the frequency and a divergence in the fwhm when the band - gap is of the order of the phonon energy .    in the most general situation the electric field and @xmath5 are both finite . in fig.[shift-1 ]",
    "we show the raman shift of bilayer graphene as functions of @xmath5 , for different values of @xmath0 . in these cases ,",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath45 modes do mix , and at certain values of @xmath0 and @xmath5 two modes become raman visible .",
    "our results show an asymmetry between positive and negative values of @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , in the case @xmath0 = 2.4 @xmath52 the fwhm of the lowest mode at @xmath53 -4 @xmath52 is higher than the same quantity for the case @xmath0 = -2.4 @xmath52 at @xmath53 4 @xmath52 .",
    "this is due to the electron - hole asymmetry in the band structure , which is properly described in our calculations .",
    "moreover , the asymmetry between positive and negative @xmath5 is enhanced by the effect of the lattice spacing variation induced by the doping charge .",
    "our results are qualitatively in agreement with recent calculations,@xcite based on tb model .",
    "they are however quantitatively different , because in our calculations we include the electron - hole asymmetry , the lattice spacing variation due to doping charge , and both inter- and intra - layer polarizations . the dependence on @xmath5 of the frequencies , fwhm , and relative raman intensities",
    "is strongly influenced by @xmath0 , and on the basis of this observation we claim that the amount of uncontrolled @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be estimated from the raman spectra of bilayer graphene when two modes are observed .    .",
    "filled dots are experimental results from ref.@xcite , shifted by @xmath54=-1.8 @xmath52 .",
    "lines are the theoretical values for @xmath0=-0.15 , -0.25 , -0.35 @xmath52 . ]",
    "we now compare our calculations to the experimental raman spectra of bilayer graphene where the splitting of the @xmath7 mode is reported .",
    "@xcite in this work charges are intentionally induced on the system by applying a gate voltage between the bilayer and the @xmath6 substrate .",
    "however , unintentional @xmath0 and @xmath1 arising from the atmosphere and the substrate can be present at zero gate voltage . by comparing the experimental and calculated raman shifts as a function of @xmath5 for different @xmath0",
    ", we estimate a total electron concentration at zero gate voltage @xmath54 = -1.8 @xmath55 . in fig.[exp]-a and -b",
    "we show the ratio between the relative raman intensities of the highest and lowest mode , and the raman shifts , respectively , as a function of the electron concentration @xmath5 , for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the former one strongly depends on @xmath0 , while the frequency shifts have a weaker dependence .",
    "the best agreement between theory and experiments indicates an unintentional charge coming from the atmosphere @xmath56=-0.25 @xmath52 . from our estimate of @xmath54",
    ", we deduce an unintentional charge from the substrate @xmath57=@xmath54-@xmath56=",
    "-1.55 @xmath52 .",
    "the agreement between experimental data and theoretical results is good .",
    "however , we notice that the slope of the theoretical curves is underestimated with respect to the experimental ones",
    ". this could be possibly due to local desorption of molecules and doping variation induced by the laser light , or to hysteresis effects in the doping dependence on gate voltage .",
    "finally , in the right side of fig.[shift]-b , we compare our theoretical results to the experimental frequencies and broadenings from recent infra - red measurements in ref.@xcite , where the doping charge is kept fixed to zero and the electric field is varied .",
    "the agreement is excellent with our lower frequency mode . in our calculations ,",
    "the lower mode has a weak projection on @xmath11 .",
    "however , this mode is strongly coupled with the electrons , as testified by the large fwhm .",
    "such coupling enhances the effective charges associated with @xmath11 and increases the infra - red activity .",
    "@xcite indeed , in fig.3 of ref.@xcite the measured infra - red intensity is maximum when the band - gap equals the phonon energy ( about 0.2 ev ) , i.e. when the fwhm and thus the coupling of the mode with the electrons are maximum , while it decreases when the fwhm decreases .",
    "in summary , we have computed the raman spectra of gated bilayer graphene , which is strongly influenced by the interaction with the environment . we claim that by the analysis of the splitting of the @xmath7 mode in raman measurements it is possible to estimate the amount of unintentional charges coming from the atmosphere and from the substrate .",
    "here we compare our calculations with the only experimental data available on the @xmath7 mode splitting in bilayer graphene , and we give an estimate of the unintentional charges coming from the environment in this experiment . in order to facilitate the comparison of new experimental results with our theoretical calculations , we provide as additional material a set of computed raman shifts , fwhm , and relative raman intensities as a function of @xmath5 , for different values of @xmath0 ."
