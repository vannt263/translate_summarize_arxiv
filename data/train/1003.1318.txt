    "owing to its exceptional thermal and physical properties,@xcite silicon carbide ( sic ) is a material , which is convenient for high temperature and high power device applications . because of its wide band gap",
    ", sic bulk structure has been a subject of active study in optical and optoelectronic research . unlike the polymorphs of carbon ,",
    "sic is a polar material . in spite of the fact that both constituents of sic are group iv elements ,",
    "charge is transferred from si to c due to higher electronegativity of c relative to si atom .",
    "bulk sic has six commonly used stacking configurations denoted as 3c ( zincblende ) , 2h ( wurtzite ) , 4h , 6h , 15r and 21r .",
    "lubinsky _ _ et al.__@xcite reported optical data related with indirect transitions , dielectric function and reflectivity of 3c sic using first - principles hartree - fock - slater method .",
    "a more comprehensive study@xcite using olcao ( orthogonalized linear combination of atomic orbitals ) method comprises the calculations of lattice constants , electronic band structure and optical properties of all six stacking configuration of sic .    as for sic in lower dimensionality , sio@xmath0 coated sic nanowires @xcite were synthesized and showed favorable photocatalytic behavior . a theoretical work on hydrogen passivated sic nanowires@xcite provided the energy bands both using local density approximation within density functional theory ( dft ) and @xmath1 lcao tight binding ( tb ) methods",
    "sic - zns core - shell structures were also fabricated.@xcite zincblende sic nanoparticles were synthesized by carbothermal reduction method.@xcite band gap of zincblende nanoparticles were estimated to be around 3 ev from photoluminesence measurements . with a similar carbothermal method , microribbons@xcite with widths in the range of 500 nm - 5 @xmath2 m and thickness of 50 - 500",
    "nm were synthesized .",
    "sic is frequently used as a substrate to grow other materials.@xcite few layers of graphene was also grown on sic.@xcite sic clusters ( si@xmath3c@xmath3 , n=1 - 10 ) were investigated@xcite using dft . with the aim of developing a material for future nanoelectronic applications , binding energy , homo - lumo gap , mulliken charge , vibrational spectrum and ionization potential of si@xmath3c@xmath3 clusters are revealed .",
    "earlier , planar honeycomb structure of graphite was exfoliated and its physical properties were analyzed.@xcite while graphene is a strictly planar crystal , the planar honeycomb structure of si is unstable , but it is stabilized through puckering.@xcite since the honeycomb structure is common to both c and si , one expects that stable 2d sic in honeycomb structure can be synthesized .    in this paper , a comprehensive analysis of the atomic , electronic and magnetic properties of 2d monolayer of sic honeycomb structure and its bare and hydrogen passivated armchair nanoribbons ( a - sicnr ) are carried out using first - principles calculations . in spite of the fact that 2d sic monolayer is not synthesized yet , this study demonstrates its stability based on reliable theoretical methods .",
    "furthermore , various mechanical , electronic and magnetic properties are revealed .",
    "we started with the discussion of 3d zincblende and wurtzite crystals , as well as sic atomic chain as an ultimate 1d system ; we presented an analysis of optimized atomic structures with corresponding phonon dispersion curves and electronic energy band structures and effective charges .",
    "then we provided an extensive analysis of 2d and quasi-1d ( nanoribbon ) sic in terms of the optimized atomic structures and their stability , electronic and magnetic structures .",
    "we revealed elastic constants , such as in - plane stiffness and poisson s ratio .",
    "having obtained the results for 1d , 2d and 3d structures , we presented a comprehensive discussion of dimensionality effects .",
    "then we investigated the effect of vacancy defects ( such as si and c vacancy , si+c vacancy and c - si antisite defect ) on the electronic and magnetic properties of single layer sic and its armchair nanoribbons .",
    "furthermore , we showed that sic can be functionalized through adsorption of a foreign atom to the surface of 2d sic or through substitution of either c or si with a foreign atom .",
    "it is revealed that 2d sic and its ribbons provide unusual physical properties , which are absent in 3d sic crystals .",
    "for example , while various allotropic forms of sic including its honeycomb structures are normally non - magnetic semiconductors , a si vacancy gives rise to spin polarization . significant variation of the band gap of narrow a - sicnr s with their widths may be crucial in designing optoelectronic nanodevices .",
    "we have performed first - principles plane wave calculations within dft using paw potentials.@xcite the exchange correlation potential has been approximated by generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using pw91@xcite functional both for spin - polarized and spin - unpolarized cases . for the sake of comparison , the calculations are also carried out using different potentials and exchange - correlation approximations .",
    "all structures have been treated within the supercell geometry using the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a plane - wave basis set with kinetic energy cutoff of 500 ev has been used .",
    "a vacuum spacing of 12  hinders the interactions between sic monolayers in adjacent supercells . in the self - consistent structure optimizations ,",
    "the brillouin zone ( bz ) is sampled by , respectively ( 5@xmath45@xmath45 ) , ( 11@xmath411@xmath41 ) and ( 11@xmath41@xmath41 ) special * k*-points for 3d bulk , 2d honeycomb and 1d nanoribbons of sic .",
    "further relaxation is made with ( 11@xmath411@xmath411 ) , ( 31@xmath431@xmath41 ) and ( 25@xmath41@xmath41 ) special * k*-points in order to find the final structure .",
    "all atomic positions and lattice constants are optimized by using the conjugate gradient method , where the total energy and atomic forces are minimized .",
    "the convergence for energy is chosen as 10@xmath5 ev between two steps and the maximum hellmann - feynman forces acting on each atom is less than 0.04 ev /  upon ionic relaxation .",
    "the pseudopotentials corresponding to 4 valence electrons of si ( si:@xmath6 @xmath7 ) and c ( c:@xmath8 @xmath9 ) are used .",
    "numerical plane wave calculations are performed by using vasp.@xcite part of the calculations have also been repeated by using siesta@xcite software .",
    "the cohesive energy of any sic structure is found as @xmath10 } - e_{t}[si ] - e_{t}[c]$ ] in terms of the optimized total energy of any sic structure , and the spin - polarized total energies of free si and c atoms , all calculated in the same supercell using the same parameters .",
    "phonon calculations were carried out using phon program@xcite implementing force constant method .",
    "_ gw@xmath11 _ calculations@xcite are again handled by vasp .",
    "in this section , we present a brief discussion of 1d sic atomic chain and 3d bulk crystal based on our structure optimized total energy and phonon spectrum calculations .",
    "studies on sic bulk lattice and atomic chains already exist in the literature.@xcite however , our purpose is to carry out calculations with same parameters as used in 2d monolayer sic honeycomb structure and provide a consistent comparison of dimensionality effects .     and @xmath12 are cohesive and band gap energies , respectively .",
    "si and c atoms are shown by blue / large and brown / small balls , respectively .",
    "zero of the energy is set to the fermi energy , @xmath13 .",
    ", width=302 ]      earlier , the first theoretical study of atomic chains of group iv and iii - v binary compounds were reported by senger _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite they examined sic atomic chain as a function of lattice parameter and found that the wide zigzag atomic chain of sic with bond angle of @xmath14147@xmath15 is energetically more favorable than the linear and narrow angle zigzag chains .",
    "present calculations find that the atomic chains of sic are non - magnetic .",
    "calculated structural parameters , cohesive energies , band gap and phonon modes of linear and zigzag atomic chains , which are relevant for the present study are given in table  [ table : chain ] . the charge transfer from si to c",
    "is calculated to be @xmath16q= 2.28 electrons using the bader analysis.@xcite phonon modes calculated with force constant method have imaginary frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] two acoustical and two optical branches of linear sic chain have imaginary frequencies .",
    "also wide angle zigzag sic chain has one optical and one acoustical branches with imaginary frequencies .",

    "we present a study on 1d sic chains , 2d monolayer of sic in honeycomb structure and its armchair nanoribbons , 3d bulk sic .",
    "we carried out stability analysis of those materials .",
    "two dimensional monolayer of sic is an ionic compound with charge transfer from silicon atoms to carbon atoms and has a hexagonal lattice forming a planar honeycomb structure .",
    "the calculation of phonon modes results in all positive frequencies in bz and indicates the stability of the planar honeycomb structure .",
    "this situation is in compliance with the previous works,@xcite where the honeycomb structures of binary compounds of group iv elements or iii - v compounds are stable in planar geometry if they have an element from the first row , such as b , c , n. the 2d sic is a non - magnetic wide band gap semiconductor .",
    "however , it acquires net magnetic moment when a single si - vacancy defect is created or si and c atoms of the honeycomb structure are substituted by as , p , b and n. single c - vacancy , si+c divacancy and si - c antisite defects does not give rise to any magnetic moment in the system .",
    "it is shown that 2d sic can be functionalized through si - vacancy and adatom adsorption or substitution of si c by foreign atoms .",
    "armchair sic nanoribbons are found to be nonmagnetic semiconductors .",
    "we revealed the variation of band gap with the width of both bare and h - passivated nanoribbons .",
    "the variation of the band gap exhibits also family behavior .",
    "however , the band gap of armchair nanoribbons are smaller than the band gap of 2d sic for small n. therefore the confinement effect seen in narrow graphene armchair nanoribbons does not occur here .    in conclusion ,",
    "our state - of - the - art first - principles calculations demonstrate that 2d sic monolayer is stable in honeycomb structure , and hence it has a strong chance to be synthesized in future . above results",
    "indicate that bare and h - passivated sic sheets and armchair nanoribbons can present interesting properties which can be utilized in nanotechnology .",
    "creating defects through vacancies , doping through adatoms and substitutional impurities can functionalize sic honeycomb structure and hence add new magnetic and electronic properties .",
