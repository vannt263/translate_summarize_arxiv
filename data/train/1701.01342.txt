    "the measurement of bottom ( @xmath1 ) mesons in @xmath3+@xmath3 and @xmath3+@xmath14 collisions is of interest to constrain the total bottom cross section as well as test our understanding of bottom quark production mechanisms and hadronization .",
    "there are extensive direct measurements of various @xmath1 mesons , as well as measurements of @xmath15 contributions over a broad range in transverse momentum and rapidity from the tevatron in @xmath3+@xmath14 at @xmath16 = 1.96 tev @xcite and the lhc in @xmath3+@xmath3 at @xmath1713 tev  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , measurements from ua1 in @xmath3@xmath12@xmath14 at @xmath18 gev  @xcite are statistically limited and only for @xmath19 5 gev@xmath20 . adding new measurements at lower energies and covering different kinematic regions",
    "is valuable for testing perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) calculations and constraining production mechanisms .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) provides @xmath3@xmath12@xmath3 collisions at @xmath16 = 200 , 500 and 510 gev , which extends the kinematic reach for bottom measurements . at these smaller energies ,",
    "bottom production is dominated by gluon - gluon fusion , while higher energy bottom production contains a larger fraction of flavor excitation and gluon splitting processes @xcite . the star experiment measured @xmath21 at midrapidity for @xmath22 5 gev/@xmath7 in @xmath3+@xmath3 at @xmath16 = 200 gev @xcite",
    ". our measurement at forward rapidity and @xmath23 within 05 gev@xmath20 in @xmath24 gev @xmath3+@xmath3 collisions at phenix can provide the validation of parton distribution functions ( pdf ) in a different gluon fractional momentum range @xmath25 . as the highest center of mass energy accessed by rhic collisions , bottom measurements at @xmath24 gev will also help us understand the energy dependence from rhic to lhc energies .",
    "inclusive production has a component referred to as `` prompt '' , that includes direct production , as well as decays from @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the term `` prompt '' is in contrast to `` nonprompt '' , which specifically refers to production through more long - lived decay parent hadrons ( i.e. @xmath1 mesons ) .",
    "the nonprompt component that comes from the decay of @xmath1 mesons , provides a clean channel to measure @xmath1-meson yields . at forward rapidities",
    ", the time dilation of the @xmath1 lifetime leads to a larger displacement from the event vertex before decaying to .",
    "we use this displacement to separate originating from @xmath1-meson decay from prompt through measurement of the decay particle s distance of closest approach ( dca ) to the primary event vertex .    in this paper",

    "the @xmath9 cross section per unit rapidity at the mean @xmath1 hadron rapidity @xmath29 in 510 gev @xmath3+@xmath3 collisions is extracted from the obtained and the phenix inclusive cross section measured at 200 gev , scaled with color - evaporation - model ( cem ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : experiment setup ] discusses the phenix detector setup for this analysis , in particular the fvtx and vtx detectors which are used for the primary vertex and the dca determination .",
    "section [ sec : analysis procedure ] describes the data reconstruction and simulation setup , signal and background determination , and fitting procedure .",

    "the data set used in this analysis is from the 2012 run of @xmath3+@xmath3 at @xmath16 = 510 gev and the detector configuration of phenix for that running period is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phenix_2012 ] . for this measurement ,",
    "the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) @xcite , the muon arm spectrometers @xcite , the central silicon vertex detector ( vtx ) @xcite and the forward silicon vertex detector ( fvtx ) @xcite are used .",
    "the bbc detector , which comprises 128 quartz erenkov counters with a pseudorapidity coverage of @xmath31 , determines when a collision event has taken place .",
    "the bbc provides the minimum - bias trigger , by requiring a coincidence between at least one hit in both the positive and negative acceptance of the bbc .",
    "the phenix muon detectors are divided into the north ( @xmath32 ) and the south ( @xmath33 ) arms .",
    "each muon arm spectrometer has full azimuthal coverage and is composed of hadron absorbers , a muon tracker ( mutr ) which resides in a radial field magnet , and a muon identifier ( muid ) .",
    "the mutr comprises three cathode strip wire chamber stations inside a magnet which provides a radial magnetic field with an integrated bending power of around 0.8 t@xmath34 m .",
    "the mutr measures track momentum @xmath3 with a resolution of @xmath35 0.05 at @xmath36 gev@xmath20 .",
    "the hadron absorber comprises 19 cm of copper , 60 cm of iron and 36.2 cm of stainless steel along the beam axis .",
    "the absorbers are situated in front of the mutr to provide hadron ( mostly pion and kaon ) rejection .",
    "the mutr has a position resolution at each station of around 100 @xmath37 m , which , together with a precisely determined vertex , results in a mass resolution of around 95 mev for dimuon pairs within the mass region .",
    "the downstream muid comprises 5 sandwiched planes of iarocci proportional tubes and steel . the mutr+muid system together with the steel absorbers have approximately 10 interaction lengths of material . in this analysis ,",
    "the dimuon trigger is used which requires two  roads \" found in the muid tubes with at least one  road \" reaching the last plane of the muid .",
    "the vtx ( installed in 2011 ) comprises two inner pixel layers and two outer strip layers distributed from 2.5 cm to 14.0 cm along the radial direction , covering @xmath38 radians in azimuth and @xmath39 cm along the @xmath40 axis ( beam direction ) .",
    "the radii of the inner silicon pixel detectors are 2.5 and 5.0 cm , and the radii of the outer silicon strip detectors are on average 10.0 and 14.0 cm .",
    "each pixel of the inner vtx layers covers a 50 @xmath37 m @xmath30 450 @xmath37 m active area @xcite .",
    "the fvtx , installed in front of the hadron absorbers in 2012 , comprises 4 silicon disks perpendicular to the beam axis and placed at approximately @xmath40 = @xmath41 cm , @xmath42 cm , @xmath43 cm and @xmath44 cm .",
    "the rapidity coverage of the fvtx overlaps the muon arm coverage .",
    "each fvtx disk comprises 48 individual silicon sensors ( wedges ) and each wedge contains two columns of strips that each span an azimuthal segmentation of @xmath45 .",
    "the column comprises mini - strips with 75 @xmath37 m width in the radial direction .",
    "the strip length in the azimuthal ( @xmath46 ) direction varies from 3.4 mm at the inner radius to 11.5 mm at the outer radius for the largest stations @xcite . for track reconstruction with the combined fvtx+vtx detectors ,",
    "only the two inner pixel layers in the vtx are used .",
    "the fvtx enhances the existing muon arm tracking performance in several ways .",
    "the fvtx helps reject hadrons that undergo multiple scattering or decay inside the hadron absorber by requiring a good joint fit of fvtx and mutr tracks .",
    "it also provides a better opening angle determination than the mutr alone can provide , which results in an improved mass resolution for dimuon pairs .",
    "finally , the additional precision tracking added in front of the hadron absorber by the fvtx makes the measurement of displaced tracks possible when combined with a determination of the primary vertex position .    due to limited resolutions in the @xmath40 and azimuthal @xmath46 components of the fvtx detector ,",
    "the separation of prompt and decay muons is realized with the fvtx using the dca measurement instead of measuring the displaced vertex of decayed muons . because the fvtx has better resolution in the radial direction than in the azimuthal direction ,",
    "the radial dca ( dca@xmath47 ) is the primary variable used in this analysis .",
    "the primary vertex is reconstructed using all fvtx and vtx tracks which pass the track quality cut @xmath48 , where ndf is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "figure  [ fig : define_dca ] illustrates the projection of a muon from a @xmath1 meson to decay in the transverse vertex plan and how to calculate the @xmath49 . a track reconstructed in the fvtx",
    "is extrapolated to the transverse plane ( @xmath50-@xmath51 ) at the @xmath40 location of the primary collision vertex .",
    "dca is defined as the vector @xmath52 formed between this intersection point and the @xmath50-@xmath51 collision vertex point in the same transverse plane of the collision vertex .",
    "the  is the component of the dca which is measured in the same radial direction as the fvtx strips ,    @xmath53    prompt particles from the primary collision vertex have a symmetric  distribution centered at zero , with the width determined by the intrinsic detector and vertex resolutions , while the shape is asymmetric for decay particles from a displaced decay vertex .",
    "as illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ fig : define_dca](b ) , the definition of   results in an asymmetric distribution for muons from @xmath54 decay due to the projection onto the transverse @xmath50-@xmath51 plane of the primary vertex .",
    "this is confirmed by the full simulation shown in section [ sec : simulation setup ] .",
    "this analysis starts with the identification of good candidates by selecting dimuon pairs found by the mutr that are matched to muid tracks .",
    "separately , track finding is performed in the fvtx / vtx system where reconstructed tracks are required to contain at least one fvtx hit and a total of at least three fvtx+vtx hits .",
    "then , for each reconstructed mutr track , the fvtx / vtx tracks are searched for potential matches .",
    "the collision point is determined from vtx and fvtx tracks .",
    "first , regions where there is a concentration of track crossings are determined .",
    "the center of gravity of each of these regions defines a collision point . for each region ,",
    "the center of gravity is used to initiate a minimization of the summed dca of the tracks . during the minimization ,",
    "tracks with large displacements are removed to improve the fidelity of the final vertex reconstruction . the vertex determination in each event",
    "is strongly affected by the small vtx and fvtx track multiplicities in @xmath3+@xmath3 collisions .",
    "events containing decay products can also skew the vertex determination .",
    "therefore , in this analysis we take advantage of the beam stability in @xmath50 and @xmath51 during the fill ( 5 - 12 hours ) and use the measured average @xmath50 and @xmath51 position of all events in the fill to determine our primary @xmath50 and @xmath51 vertex .",
    "the spread of the primary @xmath50 and @xmath51 vertex position based on the beam spot size is around 80 @xmath37 m in rms .",
    "the @xmath40 position is still determined on an event - by - event basis for events that have a vtx+fvtx track multiplicity @xmath552 .",
    "events with smaller multiplicity are thrown out . for events with more than one reconstructed vertex",
    ", the vertex with the best reconstruction quality is selected as the primary vertex .",
    "for the reconstructed events , we obtain an average @xmath40 resolution of approximately 180 @xmath37 m in 510 gev @xmath3+@xmath3 collisions . after matching to the fvtx tracks ,",
    "the  is determined using the mutr+muid+fvtx combined track fit and the primary vertex location .",
    "the next step in the analysis is to characterize the  of muons from prompt decay and from @xmath1-meson decay through simulation .",
    "the final analysis step uses a fit function for the muon  spectra that includes the prompt @xmath0 , from @xmath1-meson decay , and background components to extract the fraction of from @xmath1-meson decay in the data , using a log - likelihood fit .",
    "details of the analysis procedure are explained step by step in the following sections .",
    "the precise primary @xmath40 vertex reconstruction is limited by the vtx acceptance and therefore only events within a @xmath40 vertex ( @xmath56 ) window of ( -10 , 10 ) cm are selected for this analysis .",
    "events with poorly determined primary @xmath40 vertices are removed by requiring less than 400 @xmath37 m calculated uncertainty on the @xmath40-vertex .",
    "runs without an accurately determined average @xmath50 , @xmath51 position of the beam center are rejected .",
    "the number of events with mb and dimuon triggers surviving after these vertex selections is 3.5 @xmath30 10@xmath57 , which is equivalent to a total integrated luminosity of 0.47 @xmath58 .",
    "the event rejection fraction is around 67% .    during the 2012 @xmath3+@xmath3 run",
    ", there were some areas of the fvtx detector which were not yet operational due to various electronics issues .",
    "when the fvtx - mutr matching algorithm tries to find an fvtx track in a dead area , there is a tendency for it to match to a track in a live region neighboring the dead one instead , pulling the matching distributions away from the central value of 0 . because of this tendency to pull tracks away from a symmetric distribution ,",
    "fiducial cuts are applied to remove tracks that point to the vicinity of a dead region in the fvtx detector .",
    "detector misalignments can shift the projected track position in the vertex plane and thus distort the  distributions . before proceeding with the data analysis ,",
    "alignment corrections are applied to the data in two stages , before and after the track reconstruction .",
    "the pre - production alignment left residual @xmath46-dependent misalignments , which were up to 100 @xmath37 m in certain detector regions .",
    "tilts which shift the fvtx silicon sensors out of the normal @xmath50-@xmath51 plane were corrected in a post - production alignment procedure , reducing the final misalignment values to less than 30 @xmath37 m .    a final verification of the fvtx alignment to the vtx , which is the most critical alignment for dca analyses ,",
    "is performed using real data .",
    "tracks which show muid activity in the fourth gap , but not in the last gap are first selected .",
    "the majority of these tracks are from stopped hadrons , which are predominantly prompt particles , and provide a high statistics sample for studying alignment .",
    "events with a large vertex uncertainty , tracks next to dead areas , and bad quality fvtx tracks are removed from this sample . to remove the hadron decay component , a minimum longitudinal momentum cut of ( @xmath59 gev/@xmath7 )",
    "is required .",
    "after the misalignment corrections described above are applied , the  is then extracted for these tracks and checked for any indications of residual misalignments .",
    "the mean of these distributions is found to be flat along the @xmath46 direction ( within the measurement precision ) and the overall offsets of the distributions are within 30 @xmath37 m in both arms .",
    "these offset values are much smaller than the detector position resolution . variations of the  mean and spread which could occur if there were beam instability , detector , trigger or acceptance@xmath30efficiency changes , are checked by examining the   distributions as a function of run and bbc instantaneous rate .",
    "the mean values of the  distributions across all runs are found to be within one standard deviation ( of the intrinsic  distribution width ) after quality assurance checks .
