    "<S> we discuss the nature of the two - stage percolation transition on the enhanced binary tree in order to explain the disagreement in the estimation of the second transition probability between the one in our recent paper ( j. phys . </S>",

    "<S> theor . </S>",
    "<S> * 42 * ( 2009 ) 145001 ) and the one in the comment to it from baek , minnhagen and kim . </S>",
    "<S> we point out some reasons that the finite size scaling analysis used by them is not proper for the enhanced tree due to its nonamenable nature , which is verified by some numerical results .    </S>",
    "<S> we have recently reported a numerical study of the two - stage bond percolation transition on the enhanced binary tree ( ebt)@xcite . two percolation thresholds , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which respectively correspond to the divergence of the correlation mass and the correlation length , are obtained . the value of @xmath2 estimated from the fractal exponent @xmath3 is consistent with the duality relation @xcite , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the lower threshold probability of the dual lattice of the ebt . on the other hand , baek , minnhagen and kim </S>",
    "<S> estimated @xmath6 for the same model based on the finite size scaling ( fss ) analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this value is significantly smaller than our estimation while their estimation of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is consistent with ours . </S>",
    "<S> thus they concluded that the duality relation does not hold for the ebt but inequality @xmath9 is true . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we compare these two estimations . in the following we use @xmath10 to note @xmath6 obtained in @xcite for the distinction .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we introduce the scenario of the second transition in the ebt , which has been already shown in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we only assume that connectedness function , @xmath11 , which is the probability that a site at the @xmath12-th generation belongs to the same cluster with the root site , i.e. , the site at @xmath13-th generation , belongs to decays as a single exponential function ; @xmath14 at open bond probability @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath16 is a correlation length and @xmath17 is a fractal exponent of the divergent clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the exponential decay of @xmath11 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cr ] . </S>",
    "<S> here we remarks on two quantities to detect the second transition , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a number of generations of finite size samples . </S>",
    "<S> we approximately identify @xmath20 with @xmath21 for @xmath22 in the following , e.g. , total number of nodes , @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> substitution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : c0 ] ) into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : b1 ] ) yields @xmath24 in these expressions , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are basically same quantities except unimportant coefficients and then we only treat @xmath25 in the following . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq : b2 ] ) leads to an important consequence that @xmath27 is always infinite in the large size limit , @xmath28 , for @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> and then @xmath29 . ] </S>",
    "<S> divergence of @xmath16 at @xmath2 , which is indicated in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cr ] , results that @xmath3 continuously approaches to unity to produce an @xmath30 term . on @xmath31 is possible but only results a correction factor @xmath32 to @xmath33 and @xmath27 . ] </S>",
    "<S> what happens at @xmath2 is essentially different from the ordinary second order transitions in amenable graphs .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we examine the analysis of baek in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they assumed a fss formula @xmath34 this formula implies , in a sense of a standard fss , that @xmath27 is finite below @xmath10 and diverges as @xmath35 with infinite @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this seems strange because @xmath27 has already diverged above @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> another diverging finite component which results a subleading term in @xmath27 seems impossible since finite clusters growing with @xmath38 must be absorbed to the already divergent clusters before diverges by themselves . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the scaling behavior is an artifact because eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fss1 ] ) is approximately reproduced from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : b2 ] ) without assuming another diverging component . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq : b2 ] ) leads to @xmath39if one chooses @xmath10 and @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 , @xmath42 looks a function of @xmath43 for @xmath44 as @xmath45 this is obtained by replacing @xmath46 with @xmath47 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fss1 ] ) . note that @xmath19 is locally approximated by a power function @xmath48 with @xmath49 , to reproduce eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fss1 ] ) in a narrow range of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the two scalings are compared in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fss ] . </S>",
    "<S> while the scaling with @xmath19 shows good collapsing of data , the scaling with @xmath50 breaks down for large @xmath19 ( we use @xmath51 in @xcite and treat larger generations by 7 than that in @xcite ) and only works in the narrow size range , around @xmath52 , as predicted from @xmath53 . note that the scaling with @xmath19 works for any @xmath54 if @xmath40 equals @xmath55 ( numerically confirmed too , not shown here ) and therefore it does not gives the threshold of the second transition . </S>",
    "<S> presumably some irrelevant finite size effect or short range behavior of @xmath31 yields the best fss fitting point @xmath10 which depends on the data range of @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> another evidence for @xmath56 shown in @xcite is the crossing of the ratio of the second largest cluster to the largest cluster , @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> why crossing point gives critical point is based on the fact that the ratio @xmath57 in the large size limit behaves as a step function of @xmath38 around the critical point and takes a special value in the middle of step on the critical point , which is clearly confirmed by the fss in the square lattice in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> again it is not clear whether this is also true for the transition of the ebt . </S>",
    "<S> if the critical _ point _ between the non - percolating and percolating phases is replace by the critical _ phase _ , characterized by fractional @xmath3 , it is naturally expected that a slope appears to fill the gap . </S>",
    "<S> such a slope is actually observed in the cayley tree for @xmath58 in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we observe a tendency in the large @xmath19 limit that @xmath57 converges to a value which continuously decreases for @xmath59 rather than forms a step at @xmath10 ( not shown here ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we confirmed that @xmath57 is far from a universal function of @xmath60 ( not shown here ) unlike for the case of square lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crossing of @xmath57 is considered to be caused by the change of the tendency in irrelevant finite size effect .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we provided a simple scenario of the second percolation transition on the ebt and some numerical evidences which supports the scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we also showed that the fss performed by baek does not holds for wide range of system sizes . </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize that the transitions of nonamenable graphs including the ebt is quite different from the usual second order transitions and standard analysis of second order transitions in amenable graphs can not be applied directly to them . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath2 is , at least , larger than their estimation and the duality relation , @xmath61 , seems valid for the percolation on the ebt . </S>",
    "<S> baek also claimed that the duality relation breaks down between the pair of \\{3,7 } and \\{7,3 } hyperbolic lattices based on the fss analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider they underestimate the second threshold probability in this model . </S>",
    "<S> the duality relation should be true in this model since both of the dual hyperbolic lattices are _ transitive _ in the large size limit @xcite . </S>"
