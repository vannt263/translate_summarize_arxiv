    "the influence of a dissipative environment on the behavior of a two - state system is often studied within the spin - boson model @xcite .",

    "nuclear spins constitute one example .",
    "the elements gallium and arsenic used in the majority of modern solid state experiments have a nuclear spin of 3/2 . the nuclear relaxation process measured in nmr experiments @xcite",
    "is determined by the interaction with a dissipative environment , for instance a two - dimensional electron gas @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have also been performed on molecular magnets .",
    "these are small clusters of a few atoms embedded into a crystal , which can be described as large spins , the most prominent examples of which ( mn@xmath2 and fe@xmath3 ) are believed to have a total spin of 10 @xcite .",
    "large spins also describe dissipation - induced collective effects of an ensemble of identical two - level systems .",
    "the coupling to the common dissipative environment introduces an indirect interaction between the otherwise independent systems . a pseudo - spin  formally the sum of all spin one halfs  gives information about the degree of polarization of the ensemble .    in this work ,",
    "we employ a master equation for the description of the large spin derived within the born - markov approximation .",
    "the validity of the latter seems to be sometimes controversial in the literature , and our aim is to demonstrate that a careful derivation in the exact eigenstate basis of the coherent system indeed yields reliable results down to zero temperature for all parameter values , as long as the dissipative coupling ( parameter @xmath4 ) is small .",
    "we take the examples of section  [ sec_introduction ] as a motivation to study the generalization of the spin - boson model to larger spins , referred to as the _ large - spin model _ in the following .",

    "the model reduces to the spin - boson system .",
    "the bias is given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 accounts for tunneling between adjacent eigenstates of @xmath12 .",
    "the dissipative environment is modeled by a bath of harmonic oscillators with creation operators @xmath13 for a boson in mode @xmath14 and interaction strength @xmath15 to the spin .",
    "the collective character of the model is due to the spin algebra which leads to non - constant tunnel rates for transitions between the different states of the system .",
    "the generalization of the spin - boson model to a dissipative multistate system has been studied by several authors @xcite . there , a particle tunnels between different sites with a constant tunnel rate , equivalent to a tight - binding model .",
    "another possible generalization of the spin - boson model arises if also excited states in a double - well potential are considered @xcite .",
    "all these systems do not show any collective behavior by definition .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq_hamiltonian ] ) also differs from the above cited generalizations of the spin - boson model with respect to the interaction term .",
    "no counter term in the form of @xmath16 is included in equation  ( [ eq_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "such a term does not occur if e.  g. collective effects of an ensemble of two - level systems are described by the large spin .",
    "however , it is interesting to note in this context that a quadratic term , @xmath16 , can appear in the opposite limit , the strong - coupling regime , of the large - spin model .",
    "this is the case if a polaron transformation is applied to the hamiltonian  ( [ eq_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "that term has considerable consequences on the dynamics of the large spin  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a large spin with dissipation is closely related to the _ dicke - model _ , described by the hamiltonian @xmath17 the dicke hamiltonian is frequently applied in the field of quantum optics , where it describes an ensemble of independent two - state atoms interacting via the common radiation field .",
    "this model exhibits the effect of _ superradiance _ as pointed out by dicke in the original work in 1954 , ref .",
    "the decay of an ensemble of initially excited atoms is not exponential anymore , as one would expect from independent atoms .",
    "instead , the time of the decay decreases inversely with the number of atoms and the maximum intensity of the emitted radiation increases with the square of the number of atoms .",
    "the dicke model does not include direct , electrostatic tunnel coupling terms .",

    ", the large - spin hamiltonian reduces to the dicke model , though in a rotated frame of reference .",
    "thus , the @xmath19-component of the large - spin model shows superradiant behavior in an unbiased system .",
    "we will find that a similar statement applies for the @xmath0-component of the large spin in a biased system .",
    "we consider the regime of weak interactions between the large spin and the dissipative environment .",

    "( [ eq_dicke ] ) , by rotation around the ( spin ) @xmath55-axis , @xmath56 the effect of superradiance characteristic for the dicke model is therefore visible in the @xmath19-component of the large spin .",

    "then , the effect results in an accelerated decay of @xmath48 with increasing spin size @xmath8 .",
    "typically , the main interest lies in the @xmath0-component of the spin and this is chosen maximum as initial value .",
    "consequently , the question arises if that component also decays in a superradiant fashion .",
    "this is indeed the case as will be shown in the following .",
    "we choose a large bias , @xmath58 , to ensure the decay of @xmath12 .",
    "the dynamics for different spin sizes @xmath8 follows from the numerical solution of the master equation  ( [ eq_master - final ] ) .",
    "the decay of the normalized @xmath0-component @xmath59 is plotted in figure  [ fig_superradiance ] for the spin sizes @xmath9 , 2 , 5 , and 10 .",
    "it is clearly visible that the time in which the spin decays decreases with increasing spin size , similar to the dicke superradiance .",
    "naturally , the exact dynamics of the large spin differs from the dicke model as the hamiltonians are not identical .",
    "in contrast to the dicke model , the coupling to the environment is diagonal and a tunnel term exists in the unperturbed hamiltonian . yet , despite these differences , the basic results are the same .",
    "the reason is that superradiance is driven by the spin algebra on which both models rely .",
    "this becomes obvious by considering the state dependent transition matrix elements @xcite which are maximal for the state @xmath60 , corresponding to @xmath61 . from the point of view of the spin - boson model",
    "it appears that the spin shows collective effects , namely a superradiance like behavior , once it is generalized to spins larger than one half .",
    "we shall return once again to the symmetric system , @xmath18 . for a spin one half , the bloch equations  ( [ eq_spin - bloch ] ) predict an exponential decay for @xmath48 and a damped oscillation for @xmath12 . already for the next higher spin ,",
    "@xmath62 , new features appear in the dynamics of the spin .",
    "figure  [ fig_beats ] shows the time evolution of the expectation values of @xmath12 and @xmath48 for different interaction strengths .",
    "a clear beat pattern is visible on top of the damped oscillations of @xmath12 . with increasing interaction with the environment , the beat pattern dissolves to a seemingly chaotic behavior .",
    "the decay of @xmath48 is superposed with oscillations .",
    "these new features have different origins .",
    "the beat pattern of @xmath12 is caused by the nonresonant bosons of the environment .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath48 , on the other hand , are due to two - boson processes .",
    "the latter is best understood in a rotated frame , i.  e. in the dicke model .",
    "there , operator combinations @xmath63 and @xmath64 appear in the master equation . in standard approaches to superradiance  @xcite , these are often disregarded by invoking a _",
    "secular approximation_. one can show , however , that these terms lead to an additional oscillation the frequency of which is approximately given by @xmath65 , that is twice the level spacing of the unbiased spin .",
    "we numerically find that the amplitude of these oscillations is increased by the nonresonant bosons .    the beat pattern in the dynamics of @xmath12 is solely caused by nonresonant bosons .",
    "they lead to different corrections to the eigenenergies of the spin , lifting the equidistance of the spectrum .",
    "we consider a spin one with zero bias at zero temperature , the same parameters as used in fig .",
    "[ fig_beats ] .",
    "the three eigenstates of the unperturbed spin labeled in the following by @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 have the eigenenergies @xmath45 , 0 , and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath12 becomes @xmath70 .",
    "the nonresonant bosons of the environment lead to corrections to these eigenenergies . in second order perturbation theory ,",
    "we find @xmath71 as a consequence , the three states are not equidistant anymore .",
    "the resonant bosons , @xmath72 , are neglected in this calculation .",
    "they lead to an imaginary part in the energies resulting in damping , which is not our concern at this stage .",
    "the next step is to determine the effect of the corrections on the dynamics of @xmath12 .",
    "neglecting the corrections to the eigenstates themselves yields @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 defined as @xmath76 as a result , the oscillation frequency @xmath74 is slightly changed with respect to the unperturbed case and we find indeed a beat pattern with frequency @xmath75 . for an ohmic dissipation ,",

    "the term in the brackets is of the order of @xmath79 .",
    "hence , for @xmath80 , the beat frequency is given in good approximation by @xmath81 .",
    "for weak interactions , the resulting dynamics is in excellent agreement with the numerical solution of the master equation .",
    "naturally , equation  ( [ eq_beat ] ) does not include damping since dissipative effects of the resonant bosons are not considered in the derivation .",
    "the occurrence of a beat pattern is not restricted to the parameters chosen in this example .",
    "similar patterns are equally found for larger spins , @xmath82 , and finite temperatures .",
    "the pattern dissolves at high temperatures or high spins . even for a finite bias , @xmath83 , such patterns can be observed .",

    "the beat pattern in the dynamics of @xmath12 for intermediate spins is caused by the nonresonant bosons of the environment .",
    "we conjecture that the beat pattern is a characteristic property of an intermediate spin with weak dissipation .    in our study of a large spin coupled to a dissipative environment , the theoretical description applied to real spins as well as to dissipation - induced collective effects in pseudo - spin systems such as ensembles or arrays of two - level systems .",
    "we derived a master equation for arbitrary spin @xmath8 within the born - markov approximation .",
    "when comparing our results for @xmath9 and ohmic dissipation to standard spin - boson niba ( and beyond ) calculations  @xcite , we found good agreement at all temperatures and arbitrary parameter values , as long as the dissipative coupling is weak .",
