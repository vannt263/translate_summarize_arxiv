    "in the standard @xmath2cdm cosmological model groups and clusters are built from the merging of already formed galaxies embedded in massive dark haloes ( white & rees , 1978 ) . besides the dynamically evolved core , characterized by a virial radius @xmath3 , any cluster has a more extended region where galaxies are falling towards the cluster center . in the simplest case of",
    "spherical symmetry , the region of infall has a `` surface of zero - velocity '' at a radius @xmath4 which separates the cluster against the global hubble expansion .",
    "the ratio @xmath5 lies in the range of ( 3.5  4.0 ) being slightly dependent on the adopted cosmological parameter @xmath6 ( tully , 2010 , karachentsev , 2012 ) .",
    "as it has been noted by different authors ( vennik 1984 , tully 1987 , crook et al .",
    "2007 , makarov & karachentsev 2011 , karachentsev 2012 ) , the total virial masses of nearby groups and clusters leads to a mean local density of matter of @xmath7 , that is 1/3 the mean global density @xmath8 ( spergel et al . 2007 ) .",
    "one possible explanation of the disparity between the local and global density estimates may be that the outskirts of groups and clusters contain significant amounts of dark matter beyond their virial radii , beyond what is anticipated from the integrated light of galaxies within the infall domain .",
    "if so , to get agreement between local and global values of @xmath9 , the total mass of the virgo cluster ( and other clusters ) must be 3 times their virial masses . a measure of this missing mass can be made by mapping the pattern of infall into the cluster ( or group ) .",
    "uniquely in the case of the virgo cluster , it is possible to resolve the location of galaxies in three dimensions and separate peculiar galaxies of infall from cosmic expansion as well as from virial motions .",
    "the possibility of a massive dark superhalo around virgo can be easily tested using accurate distances at the near surface of the virgo infall boundary with tip of the red giant branch measurements .",
    "as shown by lynden - bell ( 1981 ) and sandage ( 1986 ) , in the case of a spherical over density with cosmological parameter @xmath2 = 0 the radius @xmath4 depends only on the total mass of a group ( cluster ) @xmath10 and the age of the universe @xmath11 :    @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gravitational constant .",
    "measuring @xmath4 via distances and radial velocities of galaxies outside the virial radius of the system @xmath14 , one can determine the total mass of the system independent of its virial mass estimate .",
    "numerous measurements of distances to nearby galaxies obtained recently with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) allowed us to investigate the hubble flow around the local group ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2009 ) and some other nearest groups : m  81 ( karachentsev & kashibadze , 2006 ) , and cen  a ( karachentsev et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the average total - to - virial mass ratio for the proximate groups , derived from @xmath4 via eq .  ( 1 ) and from @xmath14 , turns out to be @xmath15 ( karachentsev , 2005 ) .",
    "but as it was noticed by peirani & pacheco ( 2006 , 2008 ) and karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , in a flat universe dominated by dark energy the resulting @xmath16 mass is higher than that derived from the canonical lematre - tolman eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in the `` concordant '' cosmological model with @xmath2-term and @xmath9 as a matter component eq .",
    "( 1 ) takes a form    @xmath17    where    @xmath18.\\eqno(3)\\ ] ]    assuming @xmath19 and @xmath20 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 , one can rewrite ( 2 ) as    @xmath22    it yields a mass that is 1.5 as large as derived from the classic eq .",
    "this correction leads to a good agreement on average between the @xmath4 mass estimates and virial masses for the above mentioned galaxy groups .",
    "the most suitable object to explore the infall phenomena on a cluster scale is the nearest massive cluster of galaxies in virgo .",
    "the kinematics and dynamics of virgo cluster infall were studied by hoffman et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , tonry & davis ( 1981 ) , hoffman & salpeter ( 1982 ) , tully & shaya ( 1984 ) , teerikorpi et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and ekholm et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) . in a model developed by tonry et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) based on distance measurements of 300 e and s0 galaxies via their surface brightness fluctuations , the virgo cluster with its center distance 17 mpc and virial mass @xmath23 generates an infall velocity of the local group ( lg ) towards virgo of about 140 km s@xmath21 . with this value of the virial mass ,",
    "the expected radius of the infall zone is @xmath4 = 7.0 mpc or @xmath24 = 23@xmath25 in angular measure .",
    "recently , karachentsev & nasonova ( 2010 ) considered the existing data on radial velocities and distances of 454 galaxies situated within @xmath26 = 30@xmath25 around the virgo and came to the conclusion that the value of the radius @xmath4 lies in the range [ 5.0  7.5 ] mpc . in the standard @xmath2cdm model with the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 = 72 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) , these quantities of @xmath4 correspond to a total cluster mass @xmath29 \\times10^{14 } m_{\\odot}$ ] . the mass estimate derived from external galaxy motions does not contradict the virial mass obtained from internal motions .",
    "however , the present accuracy is insufficient to judge whether or not the periphery of the virgo cluster contains a significant amount of dark matter outside its virial radius @xmath3 = 1.8 mpc ( hoffmann et al . 1980 ) .",
    "fig . 1 represents the picture of virgocentric infall based on current observables collected by karachentsev & nasonova ( 2010 ) .",
    "it shows a relation between radial velocities in the lg rest frame and distances of galaxies within a cone of radius @xmath30 , covering the virialized core .",
    "galaxy samples with distances derived by different methods are marked by different symbols .",
    "the unperturbed hubble flow with a slope of @xmath28 = 72 km s@xmath21mpc@xmath21 is given by an inclined dashed line .",
    "the solid and dotted lines correspond to the mean hubble flow in a model of a point - like cluster mass with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the distance of the virgo cluster itself is now well established by observations of cepheid variables in 4 galaxies .",
    "the cepheid distances anchor precision _ relative _ distances for 84 galaxies with hst sbf measurements ( mei et al .",
    "2007 , blakeslee et al . 2009 ) and 4 galaxies with snia measurements ( jha et al . 2007 ) .",
    "these galaxies reside in the cluster core at @xmath33 mpc and therefore are useless as tracers of the virgocentric infall .    at large distances on the diagram , behind the virgo cluster , while most distance measures are based on the optical or ir tully - fisher relation with typical errors of @xmath34% , there is one very well constrained group .",
    "the virgo w@xmath35 group around ngc4365 ( de vaucouleurs 1961 ) with @xmath36  km s@xmath21 contains one galaxy with both a cepheid and snia measurement and 5 other galaxies with hst sbf measurements .",
    "these observations locate virgo w@xmath35 at 23  mpc , 6.5 mpc behind virgo .",
    "the group velocity and distance indicate that this group lies very near the edge of the virgo infall zone at @xmath4 on the far side of the cluster .    the most feasible way to trace the z - like wave of virgocentric infall in detail is to make distance measurements to galaxies on the _ front _ side of the cluster via trgb .",
    "this method ( lee et al . 1993 ) is applicable to galaxies of all morphological types and provides the needed distance accuracy of @xmath3757% ( rizzi et al .",
    "the greatest precision will be achieved with lines - of - sight tight to the cluster where projection factors with radial motions will be minimal .",
    "unfortunately , in the virial cone @xmath30 , there is no foreground galaxy with a literature trgb distance . in the wider area with @xmath38",
    "there are only 2 galaxies : ngc 4826 and gr-8 with existing trgb distances between the lg and virgo .",
    "the scarcity of trgb data on the near side of the virgocentric infall wave can be understood . in the past , targets for trgb distance measurements with hst were usually galaxies from the kraan - korteweg & tammann ( 1979 ) sample with radial velocities @xmath39 km s@xmath21 . in the virgo core",
    "direction a galaxy with a velocity @xmath40 km s@xmath21 may be a representative of the local volume ( @xmath41 mpc ) , or a virgo cluster member , or even be situated behind the cluster at @xmath42 mpc and infalling toward us .",
    "the selection of candidates that might be true nearby galaxies hidden among the huge number of virgo cluster members is a complicated task .",
    "that is why kraan - korteweg & tammann ( 1979 ) even excluded the virgo cluster core ( @xmath43 ) from their consideration .    the expected number of missed nearby galaxies in the region @xmath44 $ ] , and @xmath45 $ ] can be estimated as a follows .",
    "the catalog of neighboring galaxies ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2004 ) contains 450 objects with @xmath41 mpc distributed over the entire sky . in a new version of the catalog by karachentsev et al .",
    "2013 ( = ungc ) , updated with fresh data from recent optical and hi surveys ( sdss , hipass , alfalfa , etc . )",
    "there are about 800 candidates in almost the same volume to a radius of 11 mpc . assuming that ungc sample is @xmath46% complete to @xmath47 mag and taking into account the inhomogeneous distribution of galaxies due to the concentration towards the supergalactic equator as well as the presence of the zone of avoidance along the milky way",
    ", one can estimate the expected number of nearby ( @xmath48 ) galaxies within the identified @xmath49 square as @xmath50 .",
    "we undertook a special search for likely foreground galaxies , inspecting sdss images of more than 2000 objects in the specified area . among these we found 37 galaxies with hi line widths that yield tully - fisher distances less than @xmath3711 mpc .",
    "their radial velocities lie in the range @xmath51 = ( @xmath52 km s@xmath21 , and the majority of these turn out to be blue dwarf galaxies showing no apparent concentration towards the virgo center . as objects for our pilot program to measure distances with acs hst via trgb , we selected 8 galaxies which have lower tully - fisher distance estimates . in the target list we also included the s0-type galaxy ngc 4600 with a distance estimate via surface brightness fluctuations by tonry et al .",
    "( the case of the nearby s0a galaxy ngc 4826 with d(sbf)= 7.48 mpc ( tonry et al . 2001 ) and d(trgb ) = 4.37 mpc ( jacobs et al . 2009 ) tells us that these methods sometimes give distance estimates with a significant difference .",
    "at present all nine our targets have been imaged with hst within go 12878 .",
    "galaxies situated on the nearby boundary of the `` zero velocity sphere '' will have radial velocities close to the mean cluster value , @xmath53 km s@xmath21 and , given the expected value @xmath54 mpc , distances @xmath55 mpc .",
    "the f814w and f606w images of these galaxies obtained with acs at hst in a two orbit per object mode can determine their trgb distances with an accuracy of @xmath56% or @xmath370.7 mpc .",
    "given a total mass of the cluster within the radius @xmath4 expresses by eq.(4 ) , then the measurement of @xmath57 mpc with an accuracy of @xmath58 mpc can yield a mass of the virgo cluster with an error of @xmath59% .",
    "we have observed 9 galaxies with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) during the hst cycle 20 ( proposal 12878 ) . between november 15 , 2012 and",
    "march 30 , 2013 we obtained 2080s f606w and 1640s f814w images of each galaxy using acs / wfc with exposures split to eliminate cosmic ray contamination .",
    "the images were obtained from the stsci archive , having been processed according to the standard acs pipeline .",
    "stellar photometry was obtained using the acs module of dolphot ( http://americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot ) , the successor to hstphot ( dolphin 2000 ) , using the recommended recipe and parameters . in brief , this involves the following steps .",
    "first , pixels that are flagged as bad or saturated in the data quality images were marked in the data images .",
    "second , pixel area maps were applied to restore the correct count rates .",
    "finally , the photometry was run . in order to be reported , a star had to be recovered with s / n of at least five in both filters , be relatively clean of bad pixels ( such that the dolphot flags are zero ) in both filters , and pass our goodness of fit criteria ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "these restrictions reject non - stellar and blended objects . at the high galactic latitude of the virgo cluster foreground stars from the milky way",
    "are insignificant contaminants .",
    "for some of the most distant galaxies we extended to stars with @xmath62 in order to evaluate the trgb .",
    "this extension introduces a lot of noise which is monitored by plotting cmd of empty regions beside the galaxy body .",
    "the trgb is determined by a maximum likelihood analysis monitored by recovery of artificial stars ( makarov et al .",
    "artificial stars with a wide range of known magnitudes and colors are imposed at intervals over the surface of the target and recovered ( or not ) with the standard analysis procedures to determine both photometric errors and completeness in the crowded field environments .",
    "the maximum likelihood procedure considers the luminosity function of stars with colors consistent with the red giant branch after compensating for completeness and assesses power law fits to the distributions above and below a break identified with the trgb .",
    "the slope of the power law faintward of the trgb break is expected to be approximately 0.3 on a magnitude scale after correction for completeness .",
    "if the rgb is sufficiently observed to well below the tip then the slope can be a free parameter within a restricted range but in the current cases with distances approaching the effective observational limits the slope of the luminosity function fit below the trgb is set to the expected value of 0.3 .",
    "galactic extinction , minor at the polar location of the virgo cluster , is taken from schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) .",
    "the greatest potential for serious error with a trgb measurement comes about with confusion of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) for the rgb .",
    "stars on the agb that are burning both helium and hydrogen in shells closely parallel and overlap the rgb on a cmd but rise as much as a magnitude brighter .",
    "their peak brightness , dependent on age and metallicity , can be misinterpreted as the trgb .",
    "agb stars have intermediate ages of 1 - 10 gyr although they are only in sufficient quantity to be confusing at the lower end of that age range ( jacobs et al .",
    "a general strategy that we employ is clipping of the area of the hst image to avoid regions of young and intermediate age stars ( and regions beyond the target dominated by background and foreground contaminants ) in order to maximize the contrast of the old population contributing to the rgb .",
    "the calibration of the absolute value of the trgb including a small color term has been described by rizzi et al .",
    "the rgb is redder for older or more metal rich populations but galaxies inevitably have old and metal poor components , resulting in reasonable stability of tip magnitudes in the f814w band .",
