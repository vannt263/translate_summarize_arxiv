    "during two past decades , numerously observational data , such as supernovae type - ia ( snia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background @xcite and so on , faced scientists with this shocking fact that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion phase .",
    "some people look for the source of this acceleration in the geometrical part of the hilbert - einstein action and have studied the modified gravity @xcite . on the other hand",
    "some researcher believe that the universe should be dominated by an ambiguous kind of fluid with negative pressure , called dark energy , which is able to provide such an expansion .",
    "the cosmological observational data express that the universe includes @xmath0 dark energy , @xmath1 dark matter and only @xmath2 baryons , note that the contribution of radiation could be ignored against to the other components of the universe .",
    "the nature and origin of dark energy is unknown for scientists and this fact make this kind of fluid to one of the most puzzling aspects of the universe . up to now",
    ", many proposals have been introduced to realized this phenomenon .",
    "it seems that the best candidate for dark energy could be cosmological constant which has an equation of state as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however the cosmological constant scenario suffers two well - known problems , namely the fine - tuning and cosmic coincidence problems @xcite .",
    "some other proposals for dark energy are based on dynamical equation of state which are realized by scalar field mechanism .",
    "the idea has provided large classes of scalar field dark energy such as quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintom @xcite , and chameleon @xcite . + in the last few years , the models which include an interaction between matter and other components of the model received more attention .",
    "in fact there are two different kind of interactions .",
    "one of them is an internal interactions between the components of matter , in which the field conservation relation is satisfied . in this kind , a term which describes this interaction",
    "is manually added to the model .",
    "the other one is an external interaction term between scalar field and matter . in this case",
    "the every conservation equation is modified .",
    "one type of the second kind is known as chameleon mechanism .",
    "when a scalar field interact with matter ( visible and invisible matter ) through gravity or directly , produces a fifth force on the matter which may violate the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) and creates a non - geodesic motion @xcite .",
    "there are some particular ways to trapping the fifth force effect .",
    "some authors believe that the scalar field can be coupled differently to visible and invisible matter of the universe .",
    "so according to this , for suppressing the effects of fifth force , they admit that the scalar field couples merely with the invisible matter @xcite . chameleon scenario is another mechanism to circumvent this force and solve the wep problem , refer to @xcite and references therein for more details .",
    "+ another proposal to probe the nature of dark energy is ade model @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics in general relativity results in the uncertainty relation called karlyhazy relation . in this scenario",
    "it is assumed that dark energy comes from both space - time and matter field fluctuations .",
    "karlyhazy et .",
    "@xcite argued that the distance @xmath4 can not be known better accuracy than @xmath5 if we take @xmath6 as a dimension - less constant of order unity and @xmath7 as planck time . following this work",
    ", maziashvili @xcite deduced that energy density of metric fluctuation of minkowski space - time is given by @xmath8 , where the quantity @xmath4 denotes the age of the universe and is expressed as @xmath9 .",
    "one can realized that in ade , the age of the universe is taken as the length measure ( in contrast to the hde which we take horizon as the length measure ) , which this selection in turn solve the casuality problem in hde , however the origin ade model suffers from a problem to describe the matter dominant epoch of the universe .",
    "after that wei and cai introduced a new mechanism as new - ade which the model uses a conformal time in friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - time , known as @xmath10 , instead of time @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the energy density is given as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a numerical constant @xcite .",
    "+ since new - ade belongs to a dynamical cosmological constant , therefore one need a dynamical framework to consider it .",
    "one of such a framework is known as brans - dicke gravity .",
    "another dynamical framework which attains cosmologists attention is called chameleon model that first introduced by @xcite and @xcite . in this model",
    ", it is assumed that there is a scalar field which non - minimally is coupled to matter .",
    "the coupling causes the scalar field gets an effective mass which depends on the local matter density ; indeed chameleon scenario is a way to get an effective mass for light scalar field via self interaction and interaction with matter . on the other hand , due to this coupling ,",
    "the action and field equation is modified .",
    "other important result is that the energy conservation equation is generalized as well .",
    "an interaction term appears in the right hand side of the relation which changes the behavior of matter density and equation of state parameter . +",
    "both ade and hde have the same origin , however it is argued that ade has a different ir - cutoff , and different ir - cutoff brings different results . in this work",
    "we would like to consider ade and new - ade in an interacting scenario .",
    "therefore the effective dark energy in the model is taken equal to the energy density of ade . the generalized conservation relation results in a equation of state parameter which has this ability to cross the phantom divide .",
    "+ the paper has been planned in the following form : in sec.2 we derive the general form of the evolution equations and energy conservation equation ; in sec.3 the effective dark energy is taken equal to the ade energy density and the behavior of dark energy density parameter , equation of state parameter , sound speed are obtained . in sec.4 we take new - ade as the effective dark energy and we study the behavior of cosmological parameter of the model . in sec.5",
    "we fit the data for ade mechanism and find out the best fit for free parameters of the model and sec.6 is devoted to the conclusion and discussion .",
    "we consider the following action    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is ricci scalar , @xmath15 is newtonian gravitational constant and we take @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the scalar field with a potential @xmath18 which has a non - minimal coupling with matter sector .",
    "the coupling is described in the last term of the action , where @xmath19 is the lagrangian density of matter and @xmath20 is an analytic function of @xmath17 .    to get the field equations",
    "one should takes variation of the action with respect to the independent variables .",
    "taking variation of action with respect to the metric leads to the einstein field equation as    @xmath21 - g_{\\mu\\nu}v(\\phi),\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is matter energy - momentum tensor which is defined as @xmath23 here we merely assume that matter is a combination of ( dark)matter and dark energy as a perfect fluid which has a well - known energy - momentum tensor as @xmath24 , in which @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    moreover to derive evolution equations a metric should be supposed to describe geometry of space - time , so we take an spatially flat case ( @xmath27 ) of flrw metric which is defined as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 stands for scale factor of the universe , @xmath4 is the cosmic time parameter . by substituting the metric and the definition of matter energy - momentum tensor in the eq.([3 ] ) ,",
    "the friedmann equation is given as follows    @xmath30    @xmath31    on the other hand , taking variation of the action with respect to the scalar field @xmath17 leads to the following equation for scalar field    @xmath32    the prime denotes derivative with respect to scalar field and dot denotes derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath4 .",
    "one should specify the matter lagrangian to more clarify the above equation . based on @xcite ,",
    "the lagrangian of perfect fluid has two well - known definition as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , for the case when there is no any interaction between matter and other components of the model .",
    "but in this study where there is an interaction between matter and scalar field , the lagrangian density degeneracy is broken .",
    "this means that the lagrangian density @xmath33 and @xmath34 has different results , so that according to @xcite we pick out @xmath19 as @xmath35 which describe a geodesic motion for perfect fluid .",
    "+ the next important equation is energy conservation equation . using eqs.([5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) one could obtain the energy conservation equation for matter as    @xmath36    as we expected the relation is not conserved that is due to the interaction of matter and scalar field . since the energy density is a combination of dark energy and cold dark matter , namely @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the conservation relation could be divided as following    @xmath37    @xmath38    the next energy density is related to the scalar field density that is indicated as @xmath39 . according to the friedmann equations , the energy density and pressure of scalar field could be defined as    @xmath40    some manipulation lead one to a conservation relation for scalar field as    @xmath41\\dot{f}(\\phi).\\ ] ]    in this section we have obtained the required equation for our analysis . in the following sections we will consider the proposed model .",
    "in comparison to the ordinary friedmann equation , we define an effective dark energy as combination of dark energy @xmath42 and scalar field density as @xmath43 , which @xmath44 denotes effective dark energy .",
    "so , the friedmann equation is rewritten as    @xmath45    an useful parameter in this study is energy density parameter @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively will be taken equal to @xmath49 and @xmath50 , in which @xmath51 is the critical energy density which is defined as @xmath52 . as a result , from the friedmann equation we have @xmath53 .",
    "+ to obtain energy conservation equations for effective dark energy , using eqs.([9 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) , one can achieve the following results @xmath54 @xmath55 so that the effective pressure of dark energy is defined as @xmath56 , and one has the effective dark energy equation of state parameter as @xmath57 .",
    "also @xmath58 is the matter equation of state parameter which is defined as @xmath59 . for @xmath60 , integrating of eq.([16 ] ) results in the following relation for cold dark matter energy density as @xmath61 where @xmath62 . in this step ,",
    "we suppose that the effective dark energy could be defined as ade , in other word we assume that @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a numerical constant and @xmath65 is cosmic time and therefore @xmath47 is obtained as @xmath66 . taking this assumption and using eq.([15 ] ) , the equation of state parameter of effective dark energy could be acquired as    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is ratio of cold dark matter and effective dark energy , namely @xmath69 .",
    "the interaction term in this model generates an extra term for @xmath70 , which can justify the phantom divide line crossing . by definition an ansatz for @xmath71",
    ", it can be considered as @xmath72      in this section we want to fit the free parameters for ade in an external scalar field interaction model .",
    "to achieve this purpose we use the @xmath73 union @xmath74 sample database of @xmath75 , and we assume @xmath76 . in this work",
    "the effect of coefficient @xmath20 which is appeared in eq.([5 ] ) , leads us to introduce some effective density parameters such as @xmath77 therefore in this case the friemann equation is as @xmath78 combining eqs.([15])-([18 ] ) , give @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the effective energy density of matter at the present time and @xmath65 is the cosmic time .",

    "<S> agegraphic dark energy(ade ) and new - ade models have been introduced as two candidates for dark energy to explain the accelerated expansion phase of the universe . in spite of a few suitable features of these models some studies </S>",
    "<S> have shown that there are several drawbacks in them . therefore in this investigation a new version of ade and new - ade </S>",
    "<S> are studied which can improve such drawbacks which appear in the ordinary ade and new - ade scenario . </S>",
    "<S> in fact we consider an interacting model of scalar field with matter and after re - deriving some cosmological parameters of the model , we find out the best fit for the model . actually by finding the best fitting for free parameters of the model , we show that our theoretical results are in a good agreement with observational data . </S>"
