    "the recording of a powder diffraction signal using a two - dimensional detector is a potentially simple and efficient technique for determining characteristic structural length scales in crystals .",
    "the basis of the technique lies in that a scattering volume containing an isotropic powder consisting of a large number of particles with identical crystalline structure offers to the incoming beam all possible incidence orientations with respect to the crystallites .",
    "consequently , all the diffraction peaks characteristic of the crystallite structure are visible in any of the azimuthal planes , and all azimuthal planes are equivalent : a simple scan of the deviation angle , @xmath1 , in a given azimuthal plane , provides a spectrum containing peaks at all structural length scales characteristic of the crystallites , apart from those extinct due to form factor effects .",
    "the scattering image collected by a two - dimensional detector is isotropic , and its center of symmetry denotes the direction of the incident beam .",
    "radial cuts of the images passing through this center provide identical one - dimensional spectra that can be averaged over all azimuthal angles in order to significantly increase the signal to noise ratio .",
    "it is well known that reconstruction of the three - dimensional crystal structure from powder data is made difficult by the overlapping of reflections with similar diffraction angles .",
    "the interpretation is fairly easy in the case where only a dominant feature of the structure is investigated .",
    "a particular case is that of nano - layered systems , where the powder is made of particles , or clusters of particles , that consist of a stack of identical quasi-2d crystallites .",
    "the bragg reflections resulting from the set of bragg planes associated to those stacks are the most intense and can be interpreted in quite a straightforward manner .",
    "a number of natural ( vermiculite , montmorillonite ) and synthetic ( fluorohectorite ) smectite clays have the properties of presenting , in the weakly - hydrated states , a microstructure where particles are platelet - shaped and nano - layered .",
    "the repeating crystallite is a 1nm - thick silicate - platelet , and the stacks are held together by cations shared between adjacent platelets .",
    "the stacks can swell by intercalation of ions and molecules ( water , in particular ) , and powder diffraction has been used extensively to study that swelling , both on natural @xcite and synthetic @xcite smectite clays .",
    "a wide range of natural or man - made materials are aggregates of crystallites with the same crystallographic structure .",
    "the distribution of the crystallite orientations inside the material are rarely isotropic , hence their x - ray diffraction signal is that of an anisotropic powder .",
    "many examples of such polycrystalline aggregates can be found among metals .",
    "the analysis from x - ray diffraction data of the preferred crystallographic orientations in those metals , i.  e. , their _ texture _ , provides information on the history of their deformation @xcite , as it does for rocks , another type of polycrystalline materials with a larger degree of complexity ( several types of crystals coexist ) .",
    "this is done by decomposing the distribution of the reflections intensities as a function of the angular direction into a superposition of distributions resulting from single reflections ( _ pole figures _ ) , and subsequently inferring the orientation distribution probability ( odp ) for the crystallites .",
    "several general methods @xcite have been developed to tackle that potentially difficult ( and sometimes , non - univoque ) inversion . from the experimental point of view , 2d detectors have proved useful in such texture analyses , as they allow gathering of the data necessary to the pole figure analysis in a short time and without changing the sample position @xcite .",
    "see @xcite about the practical applicability of those methods . note that texture studies have recently found an interesting application in methods allowing to determine the complete 3d structure of a crystal from anisotropic powder diffraction data collected from samples with different textures @xcite .",
    "the study of preferential orientations in polycrystalline materials consisting of nano - layered particles ( quasi-1d crystals ) such as the clays presented above has made little use of the general inversion technique for texture data , since there is basically no overlap of pole figures for those materials . in the case where the odp possesses an axial symmetry ,",
    "it is classically determined experimentally by measuring a _ rocking - curve _ , in which the sample is rotated around an incidence angle @xmath2 corresponding to a well known @xmath3 reflection , and the scattered intensity is measured at the deviation angle @xmath4 as a function of @xmath2 @xcite . in this paper , we present an alternative method for determining the orientation distribution from the scattering data in the case in which it only depends on one characteristic angle .",
    "when the assembly of nano - stacks present a partial priviledged orientation , all azimuthal planes are not equivalent any more .",
    "our method is based on monitoring the dependence of the intensity of a given reflection peak on the azimuthal angle .",
    "it can thus be carried out on a single two - dimensional wide angle scattering image . in other words , we monitor the anisotopry of that image at a given reflection .",
    "note that monitoring of the intensity along debye rings has previously been done in a similar manner for cubic and hexagonal materials @xcite .",
    "we do not address the influence of the odp on the diffraction profiles in a given azimuthal plane , a problem to which much attention has been given in the past , for systems like pyrolytic graphite @xcite and smectite clays @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] , we present the theoretical background of the method , for both geometries . the method is applied to data from two experiments corresponding to two geometrical configurations observed in systems of the synthetic smectite clay na - fluorohectorite ( in sections [ sec : experiments_nem ] and [ sec : experiments_antinem ] , respectively ) . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the interest of the method .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion .",
    "we consider a clay sample placed at the origin @xmath5 of the laboratory frame @xmath6 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "an incident x - ray beam parallel to @xmath7 , and of wavelength @xmath8 , is scattered by the sample , and the scattered intensity recorded in a detector plane @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the point where the direct beam would hit the detector in the absence of a beam stop behind the sample .",
    "the sample consists of a population of nano - layered crystallites consisting of @xmath11 stacked identical layers .",
    "the orientation distribution @xmath0 of the crystallite population with respect to the laboratory frame is assumed known and anisotropic , resulting in an anisotropic distribution of the scattered intensities in the detector plane .",
    "the running point m on the detector is denoted by the direction of the line @xmath12 passing through the points @xmath5 and @xmath13 ; the corresponding angular frame consists of the scattering deviation angle @xmath4 and the azimuthal angle @xmath14 .",
    "the orientation of each crystallite s director , @xmath15 , with respect to the fixed frame , is denoted by the angular frame ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) ( see fig .  1 ) , with @xmath16 in the range",
    "@xmath18 $ ] and @xmath17 in the range @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "@xmath16 is the angle between the crystallite s director and the plane @xmath20 , while @xmath17 is the azimuthal angular coordinate of the director .",
    "let us first consider a single crystallite whose stacking planes make with the incident beam an angle @xmath2 , corresponding to the bragg condition for the stack .",
    "this implies that it mostly scatters along the direction @xmath12 , i.e , that the azimuthal direction for scattering is @xmath21 , and the deviation angle is @xmath22 ( see figure  2(a ) ) . as the azimuth @xmath14 describes the @xmath19 $ ] range , the trajectory on the unit sphere of the director for the crystallites that scatter along that azimuth describes a circle in the plane @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "this director is therefore defined in the frame @xmath24 by the coordinates @xmath25    next , we assume that the angular distribution @xmath0 only depends on an single angle @xmath26 , which is the angle between a crystallite s director @xmath15 and a reference orientation @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution is normalized with respect to the total solid angle available to the description , i.  e. @xmath28 where ( @xmath26,@xmath29 ) is a standard spherical angular frame .",
    "we assume that the size- and orientation- distribution of the particles are uncorrelated , and that the beam defines a scattering volume that is large enough for the size distribution of the scatterers to be entirely contained in it .",
    "hence , we assume that the amplitude of a diffraction peak in the direction ( @xmath4,@xmath14 ) is proportional to the number of scatterers that satisfy the bragg condition for that direction , and that the proportionality constant is independent of @xmath14 .",
    "this also assumes that the scattering peak is well separated from other peaks along the @xmath4 line .",
    "we denote @xmath30 the amplitude of the diffraction peak at deviation angle @xmath4 and at a given azimuthal angle value @xmath14 , and @xmath31 the angle between the reference director @xmath27 and that of the crystallites that diffract in the @xmath32 direction .",
    "the intensity @xmath33 along a length @xmath34 of the angular scattering cone of half - opening @xmath35 is proportional to the quantity @xmath36 , where the angular length @xmath37 is that travelled by @xmath15 on the unit sphere as @xmath14 describes the range @xmath34 . the trajectory in fig .",
    "2(b ) is travelled at constant speed when varying @xmath14 uniformly , as appears from the vector @xmath38 having a norm @xmath39 ( computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : n_vs_phi ] ) ) , and thus independent of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 only depends on @xmath34 , which yields : @xmath40 consequently , a uniform sampling of the azimuthal profile of a waxs peak in the scattering figure is directly related to the orientation distribution for the scatterers , @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , a constant profile corresponds to a uniform angular distribution of the platelets , i.e , the scattering figure of an isotropic clay powder is isotropic , as expected .    the angle @xmath31 can be computed from its cosine which equals @xmath41 .",
    "the orientation with respect to the laboratory frame of the mean director @xmath27 is defined by the angles @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and thus its coordinates in the @xmath24 frame are @xmath44 thus , @xmath45 \\right ) \\text { ~.}\\ ] ] for a uniform sampling of the azimuthal scattering intensity profile @xmath30 , one can directly relate the function @xmath46 and @xmath47 bringing together eq .",

    "the obtained parameters are independent of the particular reflection ( @xmath4 or @xmath50 ) chosen , which provides a interesting way of checking the results consistency .        in the classical uniaxial nematic geometry ,",
    "the reference orientation is the mean orientation for the population of nano - stacks .",

    "the alignment can also be quantified in terms of the root mean square ( rms ) width @xmath58 of the distribution , according to @xmath59      in the configuration that we denote `` anti - nematic '' , the crystallites have their directions on average in a plane perpendicular to the reference direction . in other words ,",
    "the stacking planes of the crystallites contain the reference direction , on average .",
    "the distribution @xmath0 is peaked around @xmath60 , monotically increasing with @xmath26 from its minimum value @xmath61 . by analogy to the nematic description , an order parameter can be defined as well , according to : @xmath62 @xmath63 and an rms angular width according to : @xmath64 @xmath65      fig .",

    "a profile corresponding to @xmath73 for @xmath74 is also shown .",
    "3 shows clearly how the parameters describing the orientational ordering of the crystallites translate into the azimuthal dependence of a diffraction peak s intensity .",
    "the angular width of the orientation distribution controls the width of the profile s peaks .",
    "the azimuthal coordinate of the mean director , @xmath43 , only has the effect of translating the profile along the @xmath14 scale , while @xmath42 is responsible for the curve s asymmetry with respect to the azimuth @xmath75 , or , equivalently , the asymmetry of the 2d diffractogram with respect to the plane @xmath76 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of this asymmetry depends on the value of @xmath4 : if there is asymmetry ( i.e , if @xmath77 ) , it shall be more pronounced for the higher order peaks of a given reflection .",
    "fluorohectorite belongs to the family of smectite ( or swelling 2:1 ) clays , whose base structural unit is 1nm - thick phyllosilicate platelet consisting of two inverted silicate tetrahedral sheets that share their apical oxygens with a tetrahedral sheet sandwitched in between @xcite .",

    "samples are anisotropic , but the width of the corresponding waxs peaks allows inferring the typical nano - stack thickness , which is of about @xmath89 platelets .",
    "this thickness is significantly larger than thicknesses ( @xmath90 platelets ) for which asymmetry and irrationality in the @xmath3 reflections are known to occur @xcite , which makes the analysis of @xmath3 peaks in powder diffraction spectra of na - fluorohectorite relatively easy .",

    ", the peak s intensity was plotted as a function of @xmath14 , and the obtained profiles were fitted with eq .",
    "( [ eq : iofphi_to_fofalpha3 ] ) .",
    "the three normalized profiles are shown in fig .",
    "7 ; they have been translated vertically for clarity . as a functional form for the orientation distribution , we chose the maier - saupe function ( eq .",
    "(  [ eq : msfunction ] ) ) .",
    "we also allowed for a constant background @xmath103 to be accounted for .",
    "this resulted in fitting to the profiles a function in the form ( using eq .",
    "( [ eq : iofphi_to_fofalpha3 ] ) and ( [ eq : msfunction ] ) ) @xmath104 \\text{~ ~,}\\ ] ] with the fitting parameters @xmath103 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : fitting_function ] ) depends on the diffraction peak chosen , as the value for the half - deviation angle @xmath2 is no parameter for the fit but is different for each of the three profiles .",
    "as each of the fit parameters controls a particular shape aspect of the profiles ( see section [ sec : modelled_profiles ] ) , we can derive estimates for the parameters @xmath103 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , using a few approximations ( see appendix  [ sec : initial_parameters ] ) , and use these estimates as initial parameters for the fits .",
    "the fitting procedure is fast and the fitted parameters do not depend on the initial guesses .    using the fitted model , we then derived the quantities characteristic of the orientational ordering in the samples , namely the order parameter @xmath107 ( eq .  ( [ eq : def_orderparam ] ) ) and the angular rms width @xmath58 ( eq .  ( [ eq : def_rms ] ) ) .",
    "the fits are shown in fig .  7 as solid lines , on top of the data points .",
    "as @xmath14 moves away from the peak values @xmath43 and @xmath108 , and as the intensity goes down to the noise level of the diffraction profiles shown in fig .  6 , the significance of the intensity @xmath109 in terms of orientation distribution of the profiles is somewhat diluted .",
    "hence , the points in the flat sections outside the peaks in fig .",
    "7 are little relevant when fitting the model to the data .",
    "we therefore estimate an uncertainty on the fitted parameters from the fluctuations in the fit parameters obtained by varying the range of data points ( between @xmath69 and @xmath110 degrees from the peaks ) considered for the fit .",
    "this uncertainty is considerably larger than the statistical error on the fitted parameters themselves , for a given fit .    for each of the profiles , the fitted parameters and the derived quantities",
    "are shown in table  [ tab : fit_results ] .",
    "the results obtained from the different orders are consistent with each other within the uncertainties , except for the parameter @xmath42 where a @xmath111discrepancy exists .",
    "this is however small , and the first order profile was expected to behave slightly differently from the others as the corresponding peak is not totally separated from the 1wl(001 ) peaks ( see fig .",
    "this profile also gives a value slightly different for the angular width , but consistent with the other orders within the error bars .",
    "we can thus estimate the average orientation of the nano - stack population to @xmath112@xmath113@xmath114@xmath115 ) .",
    "this value results from a possible non - parallelism of the average crystallite orientation from the direction of the constraint applied during sample preparation , and from a possible misaligment of the sample ( a few degrees at most ) from the horizontal direction .",
    "we now apply the technique to data obtained in wide angle x - ray scattering experiments from bundles of na - fluorohectorite particle in silicon oil .",
    "fluorohectorite samples were prepared by suspending @xmath116 % by weight of clay particles in silicon oil ( rothiterm m150 , with a viscosity of 100cst at 25 ) .",
    "the hydration state of the particles prior to suspension in the oil was 1wl .",
    "when an electric field above @xmath117 v.mm@xmath118 was applied , the suspended crystallites polarize , and the subsequent induced dipoles interact with each other , leading to aggregation of the clay crystallites in columnar bundles @xcite .",
    "this can be seen in the microscopy picture shown in fig .",
    "these bundles are on average parallel to the applied electric field .",
    "the orientation of the polarized crystallites inside the bundles was investigated using synchrotron wide angle x - ray scattering .",
    "a top view sketch of the experimental setup is shown in fig .  9 :",
    "the suspensions were contained in a sample cell in between two vertical copper electrodes separated by a @xmath119 mm gap .",
    "a @xmath72 kv electric field was applied between the electrodes .",
    "horizontal bundles of polarized particles were observed to form within @xmath120s after the field was switched on , and two - dimensional diffractograms were recorded after formation of the bundles .",
    "the experiments were performed at the swiss - norwegian beamlines at esrf , using the same beam energy and detector as presented in section  [ sec : setup1 ] .",
    "5(b ) displays the center of a scattering image obtained after the chains have settled in the electric field .",
    "this waxs data contains an significant background , with a broad ring due to diffuse scattering from the oil , but the 1wl@xmath121 peak characteristic of the nano - layered structure of the crystallites is clearly visible .",
    "it is observed to be much more intense along the horizontal direction , which means that the directors of the crystallites are on average in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the bundle @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an axial symmetry around the horizontal direction perpendicular to the x - ray beam , that is , around the average direction for the bundles , is expected .",
    "thus , the antinematic description presented in paragraph  [ sec : def_antinematic ] is well suited to describe the orientational ordering in the chains .",
    "the image analysis was done in the exact same way as for the nematic geometry studied previously .",
    "it is carried out on the ring corresponding to the first order reflection for the 1wl hydration state , as shown by the arrow in fig .",
    "the choice of a maier - saupe functional form for the orientation distribution is not only phenomenological here .",
    "indeed , this precise shape is expected in a system of identical induced dipoles where alignment by an external field competes with the homogeneizing entropy @xcite .      the normalized azimuthal profile extracted from the two - dimensional scattering image",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "10 , with the corresponding model fitted on the whole range of azimuthal angles . despite a significant noise away from the peak positions , the fit is satisfying .",
    "the uncertainties on the angular rms width and order parameters ( see table  [ tab : fit_results ] , column marked er ) are estimated in the way described in paragraph [ sec : results1 ] .",
    "the method reported in this paper displays several strong points with respect to a technique based on a one - dimensional recording , like the `` rocking curve '' technique .",
    "the first one is that it requires very little data acquisition time , since only one recording is necessary .",
    "such a recording can be obtained in a couple of minutes at a 3rd generation synchrotron source .",
    "it therefore allows in situ measurements of the orientation distribution while changing experimental parameters . in the two examples given here",
    ", it could be the surrounding humidity and the magnitude of the applied electric field , respectively .",
    "the second benefit is that it allows determination of the reference orientation in the three dimensions of space .",
    "the rocking curve method provides the inclination @xmath42 of that direction with respect to planes normal to the incident beam in the case where @xmath122 only .",
    "it does not intrinsically provide correct estimates of the angles @xmath42 and @xmath43 without prior time - consuming adjustment of the sample azimuthal orientation so as to ensure the condition @xmath123 .",
    "besides , it introduces a bias in the estimated width of the orientation distribution in the case where @xmath124 .",
    "we determine an uncertainty on the inferred ordering parameters from the dispersion on the fitted values when changing the range of azimuth angles used for the fit .",
    "this uncertainty is therefore dependent on the noise level of the scattering image , and the process is more trustworthy if the diffraction peak considered is more intense .",
    "how the accuracy of the method depends on the peak s intensity with respect to the noise level is not quantified here .",
    "how the vicinity of another peak to the peak used to determine @xmath0 , as in the 0wl@xmath121 peak in section  [ sec : experiments_nem ] , modifies the azimuthal profiles , is not known quantitatively either , and we propose our method as accurate when applied to a reflection whose peak is well separated from other peaks . despite those shortcomings , we think the method has several advantages over the rocking curve method and allows to better constrain the description of the orientational order in the samples , because ( i ) the reference direction @xmath15 is determined , ( ii ) no bias in the angular width is introduced in the case where @xmath15 does not coincide with the @xmath125 direction of the laboratory frame , ( iii ) an uncertainty is determined during the fitting procedure , for each azimuthal profile considered , and ( iv ) measurement consistency can be checked by comparing the results obtained from several different azimuthal profiles corresponding to several different diffraction peaks , on the same single recording .",
    "finally , the method is easily carried out practically , since the only mathematical procedure involved is the fitting of eq .",
    "[ eq : iofphi_to_fofalpha3 ] to azimuthal profiles .",
    "we have developed a method to determine orientation distributions in anisotropic powders of nano - layered crystallites from a single two - dimensional scattering image , in the case when it only depends on the deviation from a reference direction .",
    "the method relies on fitting the proper relation to the azimuthal decay of a given diffraction peak s amplitude .",
    "it allows determination of the reference direction and of the angular dispersion of the distribution .",
    "it was applied succesfully to data obtained from two synchrotron x - ray scattering experiments , on two different systems of synthetic smectite clay particles where the particle assemblies exhibit a nematic and anti - nematic ordering , respectively . in the first case ,",
    "the consistency of the inferred quantities was checked by comparing the results obtained from three different orders of the same reflection .",
    "the method is promising as it is performed on a single two - dimensional recording , and therefore allows in situ determination of orientational ordering in samples when thermodynamical conditions are varying .",
    "it shall be used in this respect , in the future .",
    "the initial parameters for the fitting function in the form ( [ eq : fitting_function ] ) are set to prior estimates of those parameters .",
    "the prior estimates are obtained from the data profiles using a few approximations , as explained below .",
    "the parameter @xmath126 is first estimated as the minimum value of the data plot .",
