    "a record is an entry in a series of events that exceeds all previous entries . in recent years",
    "there has been a surge of interest in the statistics of record - breaking events , both from the theoretical point of view as well as in multiple applications .",
    "the occurrence of record - breaking events has been studied for instance in sports @xcite , in evolution models in biology @xcite , in the theory of spin - glasses @xcite and in models of growing networks@xcite .",
    "recently there has been some progress in understanding the phenomenon of global warming via studying the occurrence of record - breaking temperatures @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let us consider a sequence or a discrete - time series of random variables @xmath19 with @xmath20 entries .",
    "this sequence may represent for example the daily maximum temperature in a city or the daily maximum price of a stock .",
    "a record is said to happen at step @xmath21 if the @xmath21-th member of the sequence is bigger than all previous members , i.e. , if @xmath22 for all @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the number of records in this sequence of @xmath20 entries .",
    "clearly @xmath24 is a random variable whose statistics depends on the joint distribution of @xmath25 of the members of the sequence .",
    "when the members of the sequence are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) random variables each drawn from a distribution @xmath26 , i.e. , the joint distribution factorizes , @xmath27 , the record statistics is well understood from classical theories  @xcite . in particular , when @xmath26 is a continuous distribution , it is known that the distribution of record number @xmath28 is universal for all @xmath2 , i.e. , independent of the parent distribution @xmath26 .",
    "the average number of records up to step @xmath2 , @xmath29 for all @xmath2 and the universal distribution , for large @xmath2 , converges to a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath30 and variance @xmath31 .",
    "while the statistical properties of records for i.i.d random variables ( rv s ) are thus well understood for many years , numerous questions remain open for more realistic systems with time - dependent or correlated rv s . in principle",
    "there are many different ways to generalize the simple i.i.d .",
    "rv scenario described above .",
    "for instance , one can consider time series of rv s that are independent , but not identically distributed .",
    "one example for this case is the so called linear drift model with rv s from probability distributions with identical shape , but with a mean value that increases in time .",
    "this model was first proposed in the 1980 s @xcite and was recently thoroughly analyzed in refs . @xcite . in 2007",
    "krug also considered the case of uncorrelated rv s from distributions with increasing variance @xcite .",
    "another possible generalization is the one where rv s are correlated .",
    "perhaps , the simplest and the most natural model of correlated rv s is an @xmath2-step one dimensional discrete - time random walk with entries @xmath32 where the position @xmath33 of the walker at discrete time @xmath21 evolves via the markov jump process @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 represents the random jump at step @xmath21 .",
    "the noise variables @xmath36 s are assumed to be i.i.d variables , each drawn from a symmetric distribution @xmath37 .",
    "for instance , it may include lvy flights where @xmath38 which has a divergent second moment .",
    "even though this model represents a very simple markov chain , statistical properties of certain observables associated with such a walk may be quite nontrivial to compute , depending on which observable one is studying @xcite .",
    "for instance , in recent years there has been a lot of interest in the extremal properties of such random walks .",
    "these include the statistics of the maximal displacement of the walk up to @xmath2 steps with several applications  @xcite and the order statistics , i.e. , the statistics of the ordered maxima  @xcite as well as the universal distribution of gaps between successive ordered maxima of a random walk  @xcite .",
    "the statistics of the number of record - breaking events in the discrete - time random walk process in eq .",
    "( [ markov.1 ] ) has also been studied in a number of recent works with several interesting results  @xcite . in 2008 ,",
    "majumdar and ziff computed exactly the full distribution @xmath28 of the record number up to @xmath2 steps and found that when the jump distribution @xmath37 is continuous and symmetric , the record number distribution @xmath28 is completely universal for all @xmath2 , i.e. , independent of the details of the jump distribution  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for instance , the lvy flight with index @xmath12 ( thus with a divergent second moment of the jump distribution @xmath37 ) has the same record number distribution as for a gaussian walk ( with a finite second moment of @xmath37 ) .",
    "this is a rather amazing result and the deep reason for this universality is rooted  @xcite in the so called sparre andersen theorem  @xcite . in particular , for large @xmath2 , @xmath39 where the scaling function @xmath40 is universal  @xcite .",
    "the mean number of records @xmath41 for large @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , this universal result does not hold for symmetric but discontinuous @xmath37 .",
    "for example , if @xmath42 , then @xmath43 represents the position of a random walker at step @xmath21 on a @xmath44-d lattice with lattice spacing @xmath44 . in this case",
    ", the mean number of records still grows as @xmath45 for large @xmath2 but with a smaller prefactor , @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "these results were later generalized to several interesting cases , for instance , to the record statistics of one dimensional random walk in presence of an external drift  @xcite and one dimensional continuous - time random walk with a waiting - time distribution between successive jumps  @xcite .",
    "the record statistics of the distance traveled by a random walker in higher dimensions with and without drift has been studied numerically in the context of contamination spread in porous medium  @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was also found that the record statistics of stock markets is very similar to the ones of biased random walks .    while in refs .",
    "@xcite the record statistics of a single discrete - time random walker was studied , the purpose of this article is to generalize these results to the case where one has @xmath1 independent one dimensional discrete - time random walks . in this @xmath1-walker process , a record happens at an instant when the maximum position of all the walkers at that instant exceeds all its previous values .",
    "we will see that despite the fact that the walkers are independent , the record statistics is rather rich , universal and nontrivial even in this relatively simple model .",
    "let us first summarize our main results .",
    "we derive asymptotic results for the mean of the record number @xmath47 up to a time @xmath2 and also discuss its full distribution .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath48 , while the full universality with respect to the jump distribution found for @xmath49 case is no longer valid , there still remains a vestige of universality of a different sort . in our analysis , it is important to distinguish two cases : case ( i ) where the jump distribution @xmath37 has a finite variance @xmath50 and case ( ii ) where @xmath4 is divergent as in the case of lvy flights with lvy index @xmath12 . in both cases , we find that the mean record number @xmath6 grows _ universally _ as @xmath7 for large @xmath2",

    "we argue and confirm numerically that the distribution of the random variable @xmath13 converges to the gumbel law asymptotically for large @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( see section ii for details ) .",
    "in contrast , in case ii , we find numerically that the distribution of @xmath16 converges , for large @xmath2 and @xmath1 , to a nontrivial distribution independent of the value of @xmath12 ( see section ii for details ) .",
    "we were however unable to compute this asymptotic distribution analytically and it remains a challenging open problem .",
    "finally , we discuss the applications of our results to the study of the record statistics of 366 daily stock prices from the standard & poors 500 index  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the evolution of the record number in subsets of @xmath1 stocks that were randomly chosen from this index and compare the results to our analytical findings .",
    "while the strong correlations between the individual stocks seem to play an important effect in the record statistics , the dependence of the record number on @xmath1 still seems to be the same as in the case of the @xmath1 independent random walkers .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the @xmath1-walker model precisely and summarize the main results obtained in the paper . in section iii , we present the analytical calculation of the mean number of records for multiple random walkers , in both cases where @xmath4 is finite ( case i ) and @xmath4 is infinite ( case ii ) .",

    "the authors could show that on average , on a time interval of @xmath301 trading days , the statistics of upper records in individually detrended stocks are in good agreement with the same statistics of a random walk with a symmetric jump distribution .",
    "the lower records however showed a significant deviation from this model .    here , we want to extend this analysis to the record statistics of @xmath1 stocks .",
    "the question is , to what degree , the record statistics of @xmath1 normalized and randomly chosen stocks from the s&p 500 can be compared to the record statistics of @xmath1 independent random walks . as in @xcite , the observational data we used consisted of @xmath302 stocks that remained in the s&p 500 index for the entire time - span from january 1990 to march 2009 .",
    "overall , we had data for @xmath303 consecutive trading days for each stock at our disposal .",
    "in @xcite we found that it is useful to analyze this data over smaller intervals , on which one can then detrend the measurements .",
    "we decided to split up the @xmath303 trading days into @xmath304 consecutive intervals of each @xmath305 trading days , which is roughly one calendar year . in each of these intervals we considered the logarithms @xmath306 of the stock prices @xmath307 , where @xmath308 is the first trading day .",
    "the random walk model then suggest that these logarithms @xmath309 perform a biased random walk that starts at the origin ( @xmath310 ) . since our analytical theory presented in this paper only works for symmetric random walks we had to detrend the stocks .",
    "we subtracted an index - averaged linear trend obtained by linear regression from the @xmath309 s in order to obtain symmetric random walkers .",
    "finally , in order to make the stocks comparable to our model of @xmath1 random walkers of the same jump distribution , we had to normalize the @xmath309 s by dividing through the standard deviations of the respective individual jump distributions .",
    "after this detrending and normalization we can assume that the jump distributions in the individual time series have at least the same mean and the same variance , which should then be given by 0 and 1 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath1 , we randomly selected subsets of size @xmath1 from the @xmath302 detrended and normalized stocks for each of the @xmath304 intervals of length @xmath311 and computed the evolution of the record number @xmath0 in these subsets . to get reliable statistics we average @xmath0 over @xmath269 different subsets with a fixed @xmath1 and also averaged over the @xmath304 consecutive intervals .",
    "the resulting @xmath200 s for the upper and the lower record number and @xmath1 between @xmath44 and @xmath312 are given in fig .",
    "( [ stocks.fig ] ) .",
    "we find that both the curve for the upper and the curve for the lower mean record number are not in agreement with our theoretical prediction for the case of @xmath1 gaussian random walks given by @xmath313",
    ". however , fig .",
    "( [ stocks.fig ] ) shows , that the @xmath200 for the stocks increase with @xmath1",
    ". we also considered subsets of size @xmath314 and found that for @xmath1 closer to the maximal value of @xmath302 , @xmath200 gets almost constant in @xmath1 .",
    "while the increase of @xmath200 for smaller @xmath1 indicates that the statistics behave like @xmath1 independent gaussian random walks , the fact that it saturates for large @xmath1 could indicate that they behave like a lvy flight with lvy index @xmath273 .",
    "we know however , that the tail exponent of the daily returns @xmath315 in the stock data is much larger than @xmath298 and that they definitely do not perform a lvy flight @xcite .",
    "much more likely is that the correlations between the individual stocks play an important role .",
    "in addition , we observed that at least for @xmath316 , @xmath200 grows proportional to @xmath317 .",
    "one way to interpret this finding is the following : when we assume that in @xmath1 stocks only a smaller number of @xmath318 ( with @xmath319 and @xmath320 ) is effectively independent and that only these @xmath318 stocks contribute to the record statistics , the mean record number should be given by @xmath321 and saturate if the value of @xmath322 is achieved , where @xmath323 is the total number of stocks . in fig .",
    "( [ stocks.fig ] ) we fitted curves of the form @xmath324 with @xmath325 and @xmath326 to the development of the upper and lower @xmath200 .",
    "the good agreement with the fitted curves and the data confirms our assumption . apparently , the record statistics of @xmath1 detrended and normalized stocks is the same as the one of @xmath318 independent gaussian random walks",
    "this finding is also confirmed by the inset in fig .",
    "( [ stocks.fig ] ) .",
    "there we plotted @xmath327 for different interval length @xmath2 and some different subset sizes @xmath1 .",
    "the fact that all the lines collapse tells us that @xmath327 is independent of @xmath1 and therefore @xmath328",
    "in conclusion we have presented a thorough analysis of the record statistics of @xmath1 independent random walkers with continuous and symmetric jump distributions . for @xmath9 ,",
    "we have found two distinct cases : the case where the variance of the jump distribution @xmath4 is finite and the case where @xmath4 does not exist ( case ii ) as in the case of lvy random walkers with index @xmath155 . in the first case",
    "we have found that the mean record number behaves like @xmath329 for @xmath330 while in case ii , @xmath331 for @xmath330 .",
    "we have then argued that , in the first case , the full distribution of the scaled number of records @xmath16 is given by the distribution of the maximum of @xmath1 independent brownian motions with diffusion coefficient @xmath240 .",
    "this statement was suggested by an exact result for lattice random walks and it was corroborated ( i ) by our exact calculation of the first moment @xmath270 valid for any value of @xmath1 and ( ii ) by our numerical simulations . of course it would be very interesting to obtain a proof of this result . from this connection with extreme value statistics , one",
    "thus expects that the distribution of @xmath16 converges , for @xmath15 , to a gumbel form ( [ gumbel.1 ] ) .",
    "this connection between record statistics and extreme value statistics could also be useful to compute the record statistics in other models discussed in the introduction , for instance , in the linear drift model  @xcite . in the case of lvy",
    "random walkers , we have shown numerically that the full distribution of @xmath270 converges , when @xmath15 , to a limiting distribution @xmath90 which is independent of @xmath18 . the exact computation of this universal distribution remains a challenging problem .",
    "other interesting questions concern the extension of these results to include a linear drift @xcite or to the case of constrained lvy walks , like lvy bridges which were recently studied in the context of real space condensation phenomena @xcite .",
    "finally the applications of our results to the record statistics of stock prices from the standard & poors 500 index suggest that , among a set of @xmath1 stocks , only a smaller number , which scales like @xmath332 , with @xmath333 , are effectively independent .",
    "the record statistics of these @xmath332 stocks is then very similar to the statistics of @xmath332 independent random walkers .",
