    "kerr optical frequency combs are sets of equidistant spectral lines that are generated after pumping a whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) or ring resonator with a continuous - wave ( cw ) laser  @xcite",
    ". when the bulk resonator has both an ultra - high quality factor and a kerr nonlinearity , it can at the same time trap the pump photons for a significantly long time in the torus - like eigenmodes of the resonator , and host the nonlinear interactions amongst them .",
    "when the pump power is sufficiently low , the intra - cavity photons remain in a single cavity - mode and their frequency essentially remains the same as the one of the pump laser .",
    "however , above a certain threshold , these confined and long - lifetime pump photons are transferred through four - wave mixing ( fwm ) to neighboring cavity - modes , provided that phase - matching , energy and momentum conservation conditions are fulfilled .",
    "this process can be further cascaded and yield a frequency comb with all - to - all coupling , and involving up to several hundred modes over several thz . in comparison to optical frequency comb generators based on femtosecond mode - locked lasers ,",
    "kerr comb generators are fairly simple , compact , robust and energy - efficient : they are expected to be a core photonic systems for many applications , such as integrated photonics , metrology , aerospace and communication engineering  @xcite .    beyond these potential applications , which have been a very powerful drive , kerr comb are also actually an ideal test - bench systems for fundamental physics , and particularly , for quantum optics .",
    "in fact , understanding kerr comb generation is strikingly simple when one considers the photon picture and describes the process as the photonic interaction @xmath1 , where two input photons labelled @xmath2 and @xmath3 interact coherently via the kerr nonlinearity to yield two output photons @xmath4 and @xmath5 . without further analysis",
    ", this interpretation already suggests that purely quantum phenomena based on the non - classical nature of light can eventually arise in kerr combs .    from a theoretical point of view , it is well known today that in the semi - classical limit , kerr combs can be described using either a set of coupled ordinary differential equations ( one equation per mode  @xcite ) , or using a single partial differential equation ( one equation for the sum of the modes  @xcite ) .",
    "it is also well known that both formalisms are in fact perfectly equivalent  @xcite , with the first one emphasizing the spectro - temporal dynamics of the system , while the second emphasizes the spatio - temporal dynamics .",
    "it is important to note here that these kerr comb models are singularly accurate : the comparison between the numerical power spectra obtained using the models and the experimental ones is excellent across a dynamical range that can be as large as @xmath6  db  @xcite .",
    "the spatio - temporal formalism is generally known as the lugiato - lefever equation ( lle ) , and was introduced for the first time by lugiato and lefever in the context of ring resonators where the semi - classical cavity fields where subjected to kerr nonlinearity and diffraction  @xcite . in the approximation of 1d - diffraction ,",
    "some of the key dynamical properties of this optical system had also been derived in the same article , such as for example the super- and sub - critical turing instability leading to roll patterns .",
    "the lle used to model kerr combs has an essential dissimilarity with the one initially introduced by lugiato and lefever : diffraction is replaced by dispersion .",
    "this difference is of no importance from the mathematical point of view .",
    "however , from the physical standpoint , the difference is significant . on the one hand ,",
    "kerr comb generation is genuinely 1d , originates from a small bulk cavity ( from @xmath7m- to mm - size ) , and involves guided fields : the system is experimentally compact , simple , low - power , versatile , controllable , and its behavior can be described by the lle with high accuracy as emphasized above despite its high dimensionality ( from three to up to several hundred modes ) . on the other hand , in the initial system , the approximation of 1d diffraction is rather poor ( the 2d approximation is much better ) , the fields are propagating freely , and the cavity is set up with mirrors : the system is experimentally very complex and the lle is a rather simplistic model , even though the number of interacting modes is always very limited ( rarely more that @xmath8 ) . + in the scientific literature , several researchers have explored the quantum properties of optical resonators with kerr nonlinearity when pumped under or above threshold .    in the case of a resonator pumped below threshold , the classical viewpoint assumes that the pump field is the unique oscillating mode inside the resonator , while all the sidemodes have zero power ( hence , there is technically no comb in this case ) . from a quantum standpoint ,",
    "the pump field is actually at the origin of _ spontaneous four - wave mixing _ where two pump photons are symmetrically up- and down - converted in the fourier domain , thereby leading to the simultaneous and spontaneous generation of _ signal _ and _ idler _ photons , respectively .",
    "this phenomenology corresponds to the photonic interaction @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the pump , idler and signal angular frequencies , respectively .",
    "the phenomenon of spontaneous fwm ( which is also sometimes referred to as _",
    "parametric fluorescence _ ) can only be understood and analyzed from a fully quantum perspective , because it results from the coupling between the intracavity pump photons and the vacuum fluctuations of the various sidemodes .",
    "this topic is the focus of a very large body of literature , particularly related to the generation of correlated pairs of entangled photons with chip - scale and integrated ring - resonators ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "when the system is pumped above threshold , the photonic interaction @xmath9 becomes steadily sustained : from a classical perspective , the signal and idler sidemodes are correlated twin beams in the frequency domain , yielding a roll pattern in the spatial domain . by analogy to laser theory , it is considered that this phenomenon corresponds to _ stimulated four - wave mixing _  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , lugiato and castelli have pioneered investigations on the quantum properties of the paradigmatic system described in  @xcite when pumped above threshold in the approximation of 1d - diffraction . in that work , they have demonstrated that the intensity difference exhibits fluctuations below the standard quantum noise limit  ( qnl )",
    ". this important result , which for the first time predicted squeezing in optical systems ruled by the lle , was obtained in the three - mode approximation ( central pumped mode and two sidemodes ) , and therefore , was only valid close to the threshold leading to the rolls in the super - critical case .",
    "et  al . _ numerically showed later on that the squeezing behavior when certain additional degrees of freedom are accounted for is still consistent with the one of the reduced three - mode truncation  @xcite .",
    "further research on the quantum properties of optical systems ruled by the lle was performed with the more realistic case of 2d - diffraction .",
    "however , in that case , the roll pattern is unstable and instead , the simplest non - trivial solution is an hexagonal structure which emerges through a sub - critical bifurcation . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of modes involved in the dynamics increases significantly because of the hexagonal structure itself ( the smallest order truncation now involves @xmath13  modes , instead of @xmath14 for the roll pattern ) , and because of its sub - critical nature ( the higher - order sidemodes can not be legitimately discarded anymore , even close to threshold , so that even the @xmath13-modes truncation is not very accurate ) . however , using that lowest - order truncation , grynberg and lugiato had shown very early that these hexagons can display four - fold mode squeezing in a lossless cavity close to threshold  @xcite , while gatti and mancini have extended the results and shown that squeezing and multimode entanglement persists even in the presence of losses , and even far above threshold as long as the @xmath13-mode truncation remains a good approximation  @xcite . in view of these preceding results",
    ", it could therefore be foreshadowed that kerr combs , which can be described with great accuracy by the lle in the semi - classical limit , can display a non - classical behavior as well . in this regard , an elegant demonstration of the theoretical prediction of lugiato and",
    "castelli has been achieved recently : in the research work reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , squeezing in a kerr comb is experimentally demonstrated between the two - sidemodes of a @xmath15th - order roll pattern .",
    "most important , this experiment is also the very first demonstration of squeezing in kerr optical frequency combs , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "+ from a purely technical point of view , other important parameters to consider are the central frequency of the comb , its spectral span , and the frequency separation between the comb lines .",
    "even though some works have shown that the combs can be obtained with a pump close to the lower and upper limits of the near - infrared range ( @xmath16  nm  @xcite and @xmath17  nm  @xcite ) , the overwhelming majority of kerr combs are generated today with laser pumps around @xmath18  nm . since this wavelength corresponds to the well known telecom spectral window , there is a plethora of commercial off - the - shelf optical components ( lasers , photodiodes , narrow filters , amplifiers , phase shifters , etc . )",
    "that are available for the manipulation of the photons around that wavelength , even at the single - photon level .",
    "it is also noteworthy that many nonlinear amorphous and crystalline materials have low dispersion and losses in that wavelength window , and these are two features that are of extreme importance in kerr comb generation .",
    "moreover , kerr combs originate from stimulated fwm which is an hyper - parametric process : hence , the frequency separation between the spectral lines generally ranges from @xmath19  ghz to @xmath19  thz for the kerr combs of interest , instead of @xmath20  thz for parametric processes .",
    "hence , in kerr combs , the photo - detected signals fall into the microwave range where there is a very wide variety of technological solutions for the careful handling of low - noise signals .    for the above reasons , kerr combs",
    "have many singular advantages for quantum optics experiments , powered by the possibility to manipulate the photons in the optical frequency domain , and measure their slowly - varying attributes ( amplitude and phase ) in the microwave frequency domain .",
    "they also have the potential to play a major role in compact or integrated quantum - information systems at optical telecommunication wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "+ despite the aforementioned theoretical works in the context of quantum phenomena of lle - based systems , and despite the promising technological opportunities highlighted above , several critical problems remain wide open for the understanding of the quantum properties of spontaneous and stimulated fwm combs in wgm resonators .",
    "the first topic of interest is the analysis of the spontaneous fwm comb spectra when the system is pumped below threshold .",
    "many groups have investigated experimentally the main characteristics of this phenomenon , but a coherent theoretical basis explaining the influence of the various parameters of the system ( dispersion , frequency detuning , etc . ) on the output spectra is still lacking .    a second challenge is that in the literature , the available research results to this date only consider minimally truncated expansions , whose validity is automatically restricted to a parameter range close to threshold .",
    "however , kerr combs are generally operated far above threshold , and can be very large  up to several hundreds of modes .",
    "they can also correspond to different kinds of spatiotemporal patterns such as rolls ( super- and sub - critical ) or solitons ( bright and dark ) , for example .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate in detail the quantum correlations in the case of kerr combs where spectrum amplitude , size and span restrictions do not apply .",
    "a third issue is related to the sources of quantum noise in the system .",
    "previous theoretical works on lle - based systems focused on gedanken experiments were the unique source of losses was the semi - reflecting mirror used to couple the light in and outside the cavity ( the intrinsic losses were null ) .",
    "the corresponding equations therefore included only one vacuum fluctuation term .",
    "however , in the case or kerr combs , the resonators are bulk , and then , necessarily lossy .",
    "this introduces an extra term related to vacuum fluctuations induced by these intrinsic losses .",
    "actually , the in- and out - coupling processes might also be distinct ( like in the add - drop configuration , for example ) , so that overall , we might have up to three vacuum fluctuation terms , instead of just one . in order to remain close to the experimental reality , it is therefore necessary to understand the effect of all these intrinsic and extrinsic vacuum fluctuations at the quantum level .",
    "the fourth open point is the explicit determination of the quadratures that can potentially lead to multimode squeezing .",
    "the conjugate variable of the photon number operator is the phase operator  @xcite , so that when the squeezing occurs for a linear combination of modal intensities , there exists is necessarily a corresponding linear combination of correlated phase quadratures in the system . in kerr combs , the large number of modes and the complexity of the all - to - all coupling amongst them allows for a large variety of phase - locking patterns in the semi - classical limit : the determination of the equivalent quantum correlations in terms of phase quadratures is therefore of particular relevance .",
    "our objective is to provide answers to the four open points highlighted above , and the article is therefore organized as follows . in the next section",

    "wgm resonators , as well as ring - resonators , generally have several families of longitudinal ( azimuthal ) modes  @xcite .",

    "the authors where discussing the physical manifestation of two - mode squeezing in the context of the original lugiato - lefever experimental system ( spatial patterns , free space signals , etc . ) : since kerr combs translate the problem to a much more controllable environment ( temporal patterns , guided signals , etc . ) , the phenomenon of two - mode squeezing could here enable to explore the phase - amplitude complementarity to a unprecedented extent .      when the resonator is pumped far above threshold , the primary comb grows accordingly and features an increasing number of sidemodes . as analyzed in sec .",
    "[ generalsqueezzphotnumbers ] , squeezing is not guaranteed anymore in the system when there are more than @xmath14  modes involved . however , the regime of large primary combs ( with @xmath341  modes or more ) is interesting for various reasons .",
    "for instance , when the system is restricted to @xmath14  modes close to threshold , the amplitude of the sidemodes is very weak and detection can be problematic . pumping the system far above threshold yields significantly more powerful signals .",
    "another interesting point is that in the super - critical regime , the higher - order sidemodes ( @xmath528 ) do not appear discontinuously : they are in fact always present , even though their amplitude is extremely small close to threshold .",

    "it is therefore pertinent to investigate systematically how the quantum correlations are affected by these higher - order sidemodes in a primary kerr comb .    in figure",
    "[ plotting_quads_sa_fct_of_power ] , we display the best squeezing spectra for the amplitude quadratures as the pump power is increased from @xmath529 to @xmath14  times the threshold for comb generation .",

    "when the system is very close to threshold ( @xmath530 ) , the @xmath14-modes approximation holds and the numerical simulations provide results that are in quasi - perfect agreement with the theoretical prediction . as the pump power is increased , it can be seen that there is a deviation from the ideal inverted lorentzian profile , but excellent squeezing performance is still achieved up to @xmath531 where there are more than @xmath15 oscillating modes .",
    "this results therefore show that even in the highly multimode regime corresponding to a resonator pumped far above threshold , very efficient squeezing is still possible in kerr combs .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spectra and the offsets @xmath394 are not invariant , as they depend on initial conditions .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the spectra depend on the jacobian matrices @xmath532 , which are built with the complex - valued modal amplitudes , and which depend themselves on these initial conditions .",

    "<S> the dynamical behavior of kerr optical frequency combs is very well understood today from the perspective of the semi - classical approximation . </S>",
    "<S> these combs are obtained by pumping an ultra - high  @xmath0 whispering - gallery mode resonator with a continuous - wave laser . </S>",
    "<S> the long - lifetime photons are trapped within the torus - like eigenmodes of the resonator , where they interact nonlinearly _ via _ the kerr effect . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we use quantum langevin equations to provide a theoretical understanding of the non - classical behavior of these combs when pumped below and above threshold . in the configuration where the system is under threshold , </S>",
    "<S> the pump field is the unique oscillating mode inside the resonator , and triggers the phenomenon of spontaneous four - wave mixing , where two photons from the pump are symmetrically up- and down - converted in the fourier domain . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon can only be understood and analyzed from a fully quantum perspective as a consequence of the coupling between the field of the central ( pumped ) mode and the vacuum fluctuations of the various sidemodes . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically calculate the power spectra of the spontaneous emission noise , and we show that these spectra can be either single- or double peaked depending on the value of the laser frequency , chromatic dispersion , pump power , and spectral distance between the central mode and the sidemode of interest . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate as well the overall spontaneous noise power per sidemode , and propose simplified analytical expressions for some particular cases . in the configuration where the system is pumped above threshold , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the phenomena of quantum correlations and multimode squeezed states of light that can occur in the kerr frequency combs originating from stimulated four - wave mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for all stationary spatio - temporal patterns , the side - modes that are symmetrical relatively to the pumped mode in the frequency domain display quantum correlations that can lead to squeezed states of light under some optimal conditions that are analytically determined . </S>",
    "<S> these quantum correlations can persist regardless the dynamical state of the system ( rolls or solitons ) , regardless of the spectral extension of the comb ( number sidemodes ) , and regardless of the dispersion regime ( normal or anomalous ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also explicitly determine the phase quadratures leading to photon entanglement , and analytically calculate their quantum noise spectra . </S>",
    "<S> for both the below- and above - threshold cases , we study with particular emphasis the two principal architectures for kerr comb generation , namely the add - through and add - drop configurations . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that regardless of the configuration , an essential parameter is the ratio between out - coupling and total losses , which plays a key role as it directly determines the efficiency of the detected spontaneous noise or squeezing spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we finally discuss the relevance of kerr combs for quantum information systems at optical telecommunication wavelengths , below and above threshold . </S>"
