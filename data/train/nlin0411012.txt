    "diffusion , the process by which concentration gradients are smoothed out , is one of the most fundamental mechanisms in physical systems out of equilibrium . understanding the microscopic processes which lead to diffusion on a macroscopic scale is one of the goals of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "since einstein s seminal work on brownian motion @xcite , diffusion has been modeled by random processes . however , we expect the microscopic dynamics to be described by _ deterministic _ equations of motion .",
    "recently it has been realized that many simple deterministic dynamical systems are diffusive in some sense ; we call this _ deterministic diffusion_. such systems can be regarded as toy models to understand transport processes in more realistic systems @xcite .",
    "examples include classes of uniformly hyperbolic one - dimensional ( 1d ) maps ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) and multibaker models @xcite .",
    "often rigorous results are not available , but numerical results and analytical arguments indicate that diffusion occurs , for example in hamiltonian systems such as the standard map @xcite .",
    "billiard models , where non - interacting point particles in free motion undergo elastic collisions with an array of fixed scatterers , have been particularly studied , since they are related to hard sphere fluids , while being amenable to rigorous analysis @xcite .",
    "they can also be regarded as the simplest physical systems in which diffusion , understood as the large - scale transport of mass through the system , can occur @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study deterministic diffusion in two 2d billiard models : a periodic lorentz gas , where the scatterers are disjoint disks , and a polygonal billiard channel .",
    "a definition often used in the physical literature is that a system is diffusive if the mean square displacement grows proportionally to time @xmath0 , asymptotically as @xmath1 .",
    "however , there are stronger properties which are also characteristic of diffusion , which a given system may or may not possess : ( i ) a _ central limit theorem _ may be satisfied , i.e.  rescaled distributions converge to a normal distribution as @xmath1 ; and ( ii ) the rescaled dynamics may ` look like ' brownian motion .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic lorentz gases were proved in @xcite to be diffusive in these stronger senses if they satisfy a geometrical _ finite horizon _ condition ( sec .",

    "we use a square lattice with an additional scatterer in each cell to satisfy this condition , a geometry previously studied in @xcite .",
    "this model is of interest since , unlike in the commonly studied triangular lattice case ( see e.g.@xcite ) , we can vary independently two physically relevant quantities : the available volume in a unit cell , and the size of its exits ; this is possible due to the two - dimensional parameter space @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this paper is to investigate the fine structure occurring in the position and displacement distributions at finite time @xmath0 , and the relation with the convergence to a limiting normal distribution as @xmath1 proved in @xcite .",
    "those papers show in what sense we can smooth away the fine structure to obtain convergence .",
    "however , from a physical point of view it is important to understand how this convergence occurs ; our analysis provides this .",
    "this analysis makes explicit the obstruction that prevents a stronger form of convergence , showing how density functions fail to converge pointwise to gaussian densities ; it also allows us to conjecture a more refined result which takes the fine structure into account .",

    "we wish to estimate numerically the above denstities and distribution functions at time @xmath0 from the @xmath20 data points @xmath94 .",
    "the most widely used method in the physics community for estimating density functions from numerical data is the histogram ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , histograms are not always appropriate , due to their non - smoothness and dependence on bin width and position of bin origin @xcite . in @xcite , for example , the choice of a coarse bin width obscured the fine structure of the distributions that we describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : polyg - bill ] .    we have chosen the following alternative method , which seems to work well in our situation , since it is able to deal with strongly peaked densities more easily , although we do not have any rigorous results to justify it .",

    "the estimator @xmath96 is the optimal one for the distribution function @xmath97 given the data , in the sense that there are no other unbiased estimators with smaller variance @xcite .",

    "we verify that adding more data does not qualitatively change this larger - scale structure : with @xmath98 samples we seem to capture the fine structure .",
    "we now wish to construct the density function @xmath99 .",

    "<S> we investigate deterministic diffusion in periodic billiard models , in terms of the convergence of rescaled distributions to the limiting normal distribution required by the central limit theorem ; this is stronger than the usual requirement that the mean square displacement grow asymptotically linearly in time . </S>",
    "<S> the main model studied is a chaotic lorentz gas where the central limit theorem has been rigorously proved . </S>",
    "<S> we study one - dimensional position and displacement densities describing the time evolution of statistical ensembles in a channel geometry , using a more refined method than histograms . </S>",
    "<S> we find a pronounced oscillatory fine structure , and show that this has its origin in the geometry of the billiard domain . </S>",
    "<S> this fine structure prevents the rescaled densities from converging pointwise to gaussian densities ; however , demodulating them by the fine structure gives new densities which seem to converge uniformly . </S>",
    "<S> we give an analytical estimate of the rate of convergence of the original distributions to the limiting normal distribution , based on the analysis of the fine structure , which agrees well with simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> we show that using a maxwellian ( gaussian ) distribution of velocities in place of unit speed velocities does not affect the growth of the mean square displacement , but changes the limiting shape of the distributions to a non - gaussian one . using the same methods , we give numerical evidence that a non - chaotic polygonal channel model also obeys the central limit theorem , but with a slower convergence rate . </S>"
