    "emission has recently begun to fulfill its long  awaited role as a tracer of young galaxies in the high  redshift universe . although early predictions based on monolithic collapse models @xcite over  estimated characteristic  line luminosities by factors of @xmath9 , the basic insight that  is a good tracer of young stellar populations in association with the gas from which they formed remains valid . because  photons are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen , their effective optical depth to dust absorption in the interstellar medium is greatly enhanced compared to continuum photons of slightly different wavelength .",
    "this effect was one of the first proposed to explain non  detections in  protogalaxy searches @xcite , and now that  emission has been detected in high redshift field galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the line is produced by the interaction of ionizing radiation with hydrogen , and is quenched by dust .",
    "thus , on the simplest interpretation , selected samples will likely include galaxies with hot , young stellar populations and little dust , properties which are expected in primitive systems where little chemical evolution has yet occurred .",
    "the large area lyman alpha ( lala ) survey @xcite has recently identified in deep narrow band imaging a large sample of emitting galaxies at redshifts @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the rest frame equivalent widths ( ) of the  emission measured in the narrow band images generally exceed the maximum expected for a normal stellar population , with 60% of the @xmath0 sample showing @xmath8   @xcite .",
    "such large equivalent widths suggest that the emission is produced in one of two scenarios : ( 1 ) young ( age @xmath12 years ) galaxies undergoing star formation in primitive conditions , where metal  free ( or low metallicity ) gas results in stellar populations biased toward massive , uv  bright stars ; or ( 2 ) emission powered by agn activity .",
    "we report on the spectroscopic confirmation of 18 narrow band  selected galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "the narrow physical widths ( when resolved , @xmath6 km s@xmath7 ) of the observed emission lines rule out conventional broad  lined ( type i ) agn as the central engines of the emitters .",
    "moreover , the general lack of accompanying high  ionization state emission lines ( e.g.  , , , ) , along with the recent non  detection of the @xmath0 sources in deep _",
    "chandra _ imaging @xcite , also rules out the comparatively rarer high  redshift narrow  lined ( type ii ) agn .",
    "these findings leave massive star formation in low metallicity gas as the likely  emission mechanism . the tantalizing limit of such systems  star formation in zero  metallicity gas  represents the first bout of star formation in the pre  galactic universe , and would be recognizable in optical spectroscopy by weak  emission .",

    "[ results ] . in   [ discussion ] , we use our spectroscopic confirmations to update the statistics of the @xmath13 population , and we discuss the implications of  and non  detections in composite spectra for the possibility of agn activity and/or zero  metallicity star formation among the @xmath0 sample . throughout this paper",

    "such a universe is 1.3 gyr old , the lookback time is 90.2% of the total age of the universe , and an angular size of 10 corresponds to 6.61 kpc .",
    "the lala survey concentrates on two primary fields ,  botes \" ( 14:25:57 @xmath1935:32 ; j2000.0 ) and `` cetus '' ( 02:05:20 @xmath2004:55 ; j2000.0 ) .",

    "the @xmath0 search uses five overlapping narrow band filters each with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath23  .",

    "@xcite with a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , an upper mass cutoff of 120 @xmath136 , and a metallicity of 1/20th solar , @xcite calculated maximum equivalent widths of 300   for a one myr  old stellar population , 150   for a 10 myr  old population , and 100   for populations older than @xmath143 years .",
    "owing to the lower metallicity , these values are slightly higher than the previous calculations of @xcite , who present 240   as the highest equivalent width achievable by a stellar population .    to properly compare these model predictions to the equivalent width distribution presented herein , one must first account for absorption in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , which affects the observations but is not included in the models .",
    "equivalent widths determined from spectroscopy are based on the flux in the observed emission line ( which may be affected by intergalactic absorption ) , and on the red  side continuum flux density ( which is unaffected by intergalactic absorption ) .",
    "@xcite used the prescription for igm absorption given by @xcite to derive a flux decrement of a factor of 0.64 for an intrinsically symmetric  emission line centered on zero velocity .",
    "of course , this calculation neglects the effects of the dust content and detailed kinematics of the galaxy ism , which increasingly appear to play a significant role in determining the emergent profile ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . nonetheless , adopting this correction factor as an upper limit on possible igm effects dictates that the limiting model equivalent widths measured spectroscopically would be 190  , 100  , and 60   for populations of ages @xmath144 and @xmath143 years respectively .",
    "a second concern regarding the equivalent width determination in spectroscopy is the high sensitivity to uncertainty in the continuum measurement .",
    "since the continuum estimate enters into the denominator of the expression for , the characteristically small continuum values , along with their considerable error bars , tend to cause large scatter in the results .",
    "not surprisingly , the sources in our sample with the largest measured equivalent widths tend also to have the largest fractional uncertainty therein .    with these caveats in mind",
    ", we performed a careful statistical analysis designed to place rigorous constraints on the number of galaxies in our sample with equivalent widths in excess of the maximum values allowed by stellar population models .",
    "first , we associated each measured line flux @xmath145 with a gaussian probability density function ( pdf ) centered on @xmath146 with width @xmath147 ; we proceeded similarly for the measured continuum fluxes .",
    "we then generated a grid of line flux versus continuum flux on which each node has an associated equivalent width and is assigned a weight according to the gaussian error distribution on each of its fluxes .",
    "next we collapsed the grid into a histogram of equivalent widths , adding the weight from each grid point to the appropriate equivalent width bin .",
    "the result is a non  gaussian pdf @xmath148 for which @xmath149 is the probability of observing  in the interval @xmath150 .",
    "we used the final ensemble of @xmath148 to determine the likelihood that exactly @xmath151 galaxies in our sample exceed some limiting @xmath152 , and we added these likelihoods to determine the confidence with which a range of @xmath151 galaxies exceed that @xmath152 limit .    proceeding in this fashion ,",
    "we find with 90% confidence that 3 to 5 galaxies in our sample exceed the fiducial @xcite upper limit of @xmath8  , and with 91% confidence that 4 to 6 galaxies exceed @xmath153  , the upper limit of @xcite , with the largest reasonable correction for igm absorption .",
    "thus , no matter how one treats the effects of igm absorption on the maximum equivalent widths predicted by stellar population models , we find a significant fraction of our sample in excess of those limits .",
    "these galaxies are required to be very young ( age @xmath154 years ) , or to have skewed imfs , or perhaps to harbor agn producing stronger  than  expected  emission .      given the large equivalent widths measured for the high  redshift emission in this sample and elsewhere @xcite , one intriguing scenario is the possibility that our narrow band selection has identified a large population of high  redshift agn .",
    "however , the recent non  detections in deep ( @xmath155 ks ) _",
    "chandra_/acis imaging of the narrow band  selected sources in the lala botes  field @xcite and the lala cetus field @xcite have placed strong constraints against agn activity among the emitters . no individual  candidate was detected with _",
    "chandra_/acis to a 3@xmath31 limiting x  ray luminosity of @xmath156 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "the constraint is even stronger in the stacked x  ray image , which suggests a 3@xmath31 limit to the average x  ray luminosity of @xmath157 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "this limit is roughly an order of magnitude fainter than what is typically observed for even the heavily obscured , type ii agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    the case against agn activity among the emitters is further borne out by the optical spectroscopy presented herein .",
    "the narrow physical widths of the  emission lines ( @xmath6 km s@xmath7 ) definitively rule out conventional broad  lined ( type i ) agn , and also disfavor narrow  lined ( type ii ) agn , which have typical @xmath158 km s@xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , no individual spectrum shows evidence of the high  ionization state uv emission lines symptomatic of agn activity ( e.g.  , , ) nor is there evidence of such lines in the composite spectra ( figures  [ compy400 ] and [ compy150 ] ) . in particular ,  flux in the @xmath159/mm composite spectrum",
    "is constrained to be @xmath160 ( @xmath142 ) of the flux in , implying a flux ratio of @xmath161 . by contrast , the three type ii agns cited above span only @xmath162 .",
    "the identification of a population of large equivalent width emitters evidently powered by star formation in low metallicity gas suggests that we are closing the gap between the first , little  enriched primordial galaxies and the higher metallicities of massive galaxies in the local universe .",
    "indeed , recent numerical studies of the rest frame uv and optical properties of very low metallicity stellar populations indicate that  emission increases strongly with decreasing metallicity , far exceeding @xmath163   for @xmath164 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the tantalizing limit of such studies is star formation in zero metallicity gas , the so  called population iii , which constitutes the first bout of star formation in the pre  galactic universe .",
    "the striking features of massive population iii stars are their high effective temperatures ( @xmath165 k for @xmath166 ) and consequent hard ionizing spectra , resulting in the production of 60% more ionizing photons than their population ii counterparts , and up to @xmath167 times more ionizing photons @xcite . as a consequence , in addition to high equivalent width  emission ,",
    "a unique observational signature of this primeval population is emission from  recombination lines .",
    "these lines are particularly attractive for a detection experiment since they suffer minimal effects of scattering by gas and benefit from decreasing attenuation by dust .",
    "that said , the possibility for the direct detection of  in the present data set boils down to two questions : is population iii star  formation occurring at the comparatively late epoch occupied by the @xmath0 emitters ? and if so , is the resulting emission of sufficient luminosity to be detected ?    as for the first question , if star formation feedback in the universe is sufficiently weak that metal production proceeds very inhomogeneously , then population iii star formation may continue to surprisingly low redshifts , occurring in regions that have not yet been polluted by previous episodes of star formation . to this end , the analytical models of @xcite designed to investigate the detectability of primordial star formation indicate that population iii objects tend to form in the @xmath168@xmath169 mass range , just large enough to cool within a hubble time , but small enough that they are not clustered near areas of previous star formation .",
    "the result is that somewhere between 1% and 30% of strong emitters at @xmath18 should owe their  emission to population iii star formation , depending on the strength of feedback in these systems .    as for the detectability of the resulting emission , early predictions of  and  recombination luminosities in metal ",
    "free stellar clusters suggest  emission in excess of 13% that of , with @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "notably , @xcite points out that the prediction of such a large equivalent width likely results from neglecting the contribution of nebular continuum emission to the model population iii spectrum , which dominates the sed for @xmath171   and therefore reduces the expected equivalent width .",
    "more recent models are indeed more conservative in their predictions of the strength of  emission . @xcite",
    "suggest  fluxes for a population iii cluster at @xmath0 ranging from @xmath172 0.001% to 5% of the flux in , where the low extremum is set by the limiting case of an instantaneous starburst , and the high extremum is set by constant star formation at rate of @xmath173 @xmath136 yr@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite predicts  equivalent widths in excess of 80   for very young zero  metallicity instantaneous starbursts , though at ages greater than @xmath174 myr , values @xmath175   are expected only at metallicities @xmath176 .",
    "physically , the best prospect for detecting  in our spectroscopic sample lies with the spectra containing  at the highest equivalent widths .",
    "however ,  at the suggested flux levels is undetectable in any of our individual spectra , leaving only the possibility that a constraint to  emission may be derived from the composite spectrum , where we benefit from a @xmath177reduction in poission noise .",
    "accordingly , we performed monte carlo simulations aimed at measuring  emission in the @xmath159/mm composite , searching over a distribution of potential  line widths set by the width of the composite  line .",
    "the result is a  flux which is formally consistent with zero , with a 2@xmath31 ( 3@xmath31 ) upper limit of 13% ( 20% ) of the flux in .",
    "the corresponding 2@xmath31 ( 3@xmath31 ) upper limit to the  rest frame equivalent width is 17   ( 25  ) .",
    "this equivalent width limit is sufficient to rule out the youngest zero  metallicity instantaneous burst and continuous sfr models of @xcite , though metallicities of @xmath178 are still permissible .",
    "we therefore conclude that this data set can not corroborate the proposition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the high equivalent widths of the @xmath0 narrow band  selected emitters suggest that the first metal  free stars have already been found .",
    "out of 25 narrow band  selected candidates , we have spectroscopically confirmed 18 galaxies at @xmath0 , implying a selection reliability of 72% . the resulting sample of confirmed  emission lines show large equivalent widths ( median @xmath179  ) but narrow physical widths ( @xmath6 km s@xmath7 ) , supporting the conclusion of @xcite and @xcite that the  emission in these sources derives from star formation , not from agn activity . moreover , though the expectation from theoretical models of galaxy formation in the primordial universe is that a small fraction of emitting galaxies at @xmath0 may be nascent , metal  free objects , we do not detect  emission in either individual or composite spectra , indicating that though these galaxies are young , they show no evidence of being truly primitive , population iii objects .",
    "of course , this last result may be a function of our comparatively small sample size , which could only be reasonably expected to yield a detection if the frequency of population iii objects among @xmath0 emitters exceeds @xmath180 . clearly , increasing our sample size with future spectroscopy will provide a far tighter constraint on the make  up of the @xmath0 galaxy population .",
    "one heretofore unexplored consideration is the possibility that galactic  scale winds may be required to work in concert with sub ",
    "solar metallicities to facilitate the escape of  radiation from a system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this scenario , the low metallicity acts to reduce the dust opacity , and the wind acts to doppler shift the absorbers , minimizing resonant scattering of  photons . the detailed geometry of the interstellar medium ( ism ) doubtless plays several roles in this process .",
    "as one example , a galactic wind driven by star formation has its origin in an over  pressured cavity of hot gas inside the star  forming galaxy .",
    "this superbubble ultimately expands and bursts out into the galaxy halo ; naturally this expansion , and hence the galactic wind , proceeds in the direction of the vertical pressure gradient @xcite . as a second example , if dust and neutral gas in the ism have a high covering factor but a low volume filling factor , it is possible for continuum radiation to be strongly absorbed while an appreciable fraction of  line radiation escapes @xcite .",
    "observationally , the extent to which the emission of  photons in a star forming galaxy depends on not only the distribution and kinematics of gas and dust in its ism , but also on the inclination of the system , remains an open question . since significant  emission in scuba sources @xcite offers evidence that the deleterious effect of dust on  emission may be mitigated by strong starburst ",
    "driven winds , it appears unlikely that spectroscopy of the rest frame uv of high redshift emitters alone will be able to fully disentangle these effects .",
    "by contrast , a detailed understanding of the rest frame optical properties of the these systems would offer a strong lever arm on their dust contents and star formation histories .",
    "hence , resolution of these issues may await infrared observations of the @xmath0 galaxy sample .",
