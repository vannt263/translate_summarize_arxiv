    "over the past several years , the picture that our universe is not baryon dominant is well established .",
    "based on the observations of wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wamp ) and other experiments , the relic dark matter density is fixed to be @xmath2 within @xmath3 uncertainty @xcite . in order to account for the dark matter , physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is usually required . among these new physics",
    "the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is one of the popular candidate for the dark matter .",
    "one possible wimp is the lightest supersymmetric ( susy ) particle ( lsp ) in susy theory with r - parity conservation @xcite .",
    "usually there are three possible lsps , namely sneutrino , gravitino and neutralino .",
    "the lightest sneutrino has been largely ruled out by direct searches @xcite , and the gravitino is difficult to be detected due to its very weak interactions with ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "thus the lightest neutralino , which is combination of gaugino and higgsino , is the most well - motivated candidate for dark matter @xcite .",
    "susy breaking mechanism plays an important role to investigate the nature of dark matter .",
    "firstly , in order to be consistent with experimental observations , susy must be broken at weak scale . as a consequence",
    ", the mass of dark matter is partially determined by the breaking terms .",
    "secondly , we need higher scale susy breaking mechanism to reduce the number of free parameters at low energy . as an example",
    "there are more than 100 parameters in minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) .",
    "thirdly , the properties of the lsp depend on the details of susy breaking mechanism .",
    "for example in minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model , the main component of the lightest neutralino can be the bino in bulk region , while in focus point region , the lightest neutralino can have larger higgsino content @xcite . here",
    "region and focus point region are determined by different susy breaking parameters .",
    "thus it is interesting to explore ( i ) the predictions for different susy breaking mechanisms ; and ( ii ) whether the detection of dark matter can distinguish among the different susy breaking mechanisms .",
    "while in literature the msugra model was widely investigated , in this paper we are interested in the properties of neutralino ( as the dark matter particle ) and its detection in the scenario of the anomaly mediated susy breaking ( amsb)@xcite .",
    "many predictions in amsb models are different from those in usual msugra models and other susy breaking scenarios .",
    "one feature of amsb model is the special gaugino mass relation calculated by @xmath4 function , @xmath5 @xcite , which implies that the lightest chargino pair and neutralino comprise a nearly mass - degenerate triplet of winos over most of the mssm parameter space .",
    "moreover the lightest neutralino is mostly wino - like .",
    "such kind of neutralino usually has larger cross section compared to that in msugra model . as a consequence ,",
    "if it is the dark matter , it should be produced in non - thermal processes @xcite , or should be very heavy , generally larger than @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the methods to detect dark matter can be classified into direct and indirect ones .",
    "the former methods detect dark matter by measuring the recoil of nucleus .",
    "the latter ones detect the final stable particles , including neutrinos , antiprotons , positrons , antinuclei and photons , which are produced by dark matter annihilation . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the observation by neutrino telescopes which detect the high energy neutrinos from dark matter annihilations ( for some recent works , see @xcite ) .",
    "the non - relativistic dark matter would be trapped by sun or earth via gravitational force .",
    "the captured dark matter can annihilate into sm particles , including neutrinos , in the center of sun or earth@xcite .",
    "the resulting neutrinos interact with usual matter feebly , thus it is possible for us to detect them after a long propagation .",
    "many neutrino telescopes for high energy neutrino have been built or are under construction such as icecube @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite , amanda @xcite and antares @xcite etc . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the neutrino detection at icecube .",
    "the icecube detector now is being built in the south pole and will be completed in 2010 @xcite .",
    "the scale of the icecube is in square kilometers and it can detect neutrinos with threshold energy of @xmath7@xcite .    in this paper , we will discuss neutrino signals from neutralino annihilations in the sun in amsb scenario .",
    "the final muon events rate at the icecube detector can be determined by @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is neutralino s annihilation rate in the sun , @xmath10 is detector s actual effective detected area , @xmath11 is the branching fraction of i - th annihilation channel , and @xmath12 is the @xmath13 flux over detector threshold per unit area and parent pair .",
    "our study shows that for the sun there exit the parameter space which can induce the large neutralino capture rate and thus the large neutralino annihilation rate @xmath9 . in this case , most neutrinos come from @xmath14 decay and the @xmath14s are pair produced via neutralino annihilations .",
    "such neutralino is wino - like .",
    "recently the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that if the spin effects of neutralino annihilation are included , the energy spectrum of neutrinos in the sun will be different .",
    "thus in our study we include such kind of spin effects .",
    "we utilize calchep @xcite to generate events of neutralino annihilation based on exact matrix elements calculation .",
    "we then import these events into monte carlo simulation program - wimpsim @xcite which performs a thorough analysis for neutrinos propagation from the sun to detector at the surface of the earth @xcite .",
    "the program contains some important features similar to those of pythia @xcite , darksusy @xcite and nusigma @xcite .",
    "thus wimpsim can analyze details of neutrino propagation and detection including both neutrino oscillations and interactions @xcite .",
    "the detail monte carlo simulations allow us tracing every neutrino event and determining final @xmath13 signals with the concrete energy and angle information . at the same time",
    ", we will consider the real environment of icecube detector @xcite , and obtain the realistic final muon spectrum .",

    "vi , the final spectrum of @xmath13 is presented .",
    "the last section contains our conclusions and discussions .",
    "anomaly - mediated contributions to susy breaking usually appear in supergravity theory , but they are loop suppressed compared to those of gravity - mediated . however the latter contributions are assumed to be zero in the amsb scenario . in this scenario",
    "there are no direct interaction between hidden and visible sectors @xcite .",
    "thus the masses of neutralino and slepton are zero at tree level .",
    "the soft susy breaking terms are related to the super - conformal anomaly , and they appear at loop level . in the hidden sector ,",
    "an auxiliary field as a super - gravity ground can be thought as the only origin to break susy . in order to have a conformal lagrangian , a compensator superfield @xmath15",
    "is introduced @xcite .",
    "we can assume that @xmath15 get non zero value as @xmath16 then expand @xmath15 in background value @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is related to the mass of gravitino ) and perform calculation with re - scaling the coupling of matter field .",
    "the soft susy breaking terms related to gauginos and sleptons are calculated to be @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath4 are functions defined as @xmath21 from these formulas we can see that the masses of susy particles in amsb scenario are determined by @xmath18 and evolutions of gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mass of slepton in the eqn.([eq1 ] ) is negative . in literature",
    "several solutions are proposed @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically one can simply add a universal positive mass terms @xmath22 to the right hand of eqn.([eq1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting model is dubbed as minimal amsb ( mamsb ) model which only depends on @xmath23 as the extra free parameters .",
    "the mamsb model is highly predictive .",
    "one of the important predictions is the relationship between gaugino masses as @xmath5 at the low energy scale , which implies that the lightest neutralino is mostly wino - like over most of the mssm parameter space .",
    "it is known that in mssm the neutralino is a linear combination of gauginos and higgsinos , and the lightest neutralino is given as @xmath24 on the contrary the lightest one is bino - like over most of the msugra parameter space with gut assumption .     in the plane of @xmath18 and @xmath25 .",
    "curves of @xmath26 ( as a measure for the lightest neutralino higgsino components ) are also shown .",

    "the relic density can be approximately given as @xcite @xmath28 such kind of lightest neutralinos usually has large annihilation cross sections in the thermodynamic equilibrium of early universe , therefore it is not easy to induce the correct relic density .",
    "however one can still obtain the correct density if lifting the mass of neutralino to be as heavy as @xmath29 tev @xcite .",
    "if wino - like neutralino with @xmath30 charge is much heavier than the weak gauge boson , the weak interaction is a long - distance force for non - relativistic two - bodies states of such particles .",
    "if this non - perturbative effect ( namely sommerfeld enhancement ) of the dark matter at the freeze - out temperature is taken into account , the abundance can be reduced by @xmath31 .",
    "thus the neutralino mass would be as heavy as @xmath32 tev@xcite .",
    "such heavy neutralino may be detected through dark matter search experiments @xcite , but it is difficult to detect and study it at the lhc and the planning ilc . for the case of @xmath33 , the light neutralino can also induce the correct density for a tiny region of parameter space , which lies in the vicinity of boundary of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . here",
    "the @xmath34 decreases and higgsino components become significant .",
    "now that the light neutralino hardly accounts for thermal relic density in the mamsb model , another approach is proposed , i.e. the neutralino is not mainly from thermal production .",
    "some authors discussed the mechanism that the lsp is produced by the decay of gravitinos @xcite ( or moduli fields @xcite ) in the amsb model . from eqn.([eq2 ] ) we can see that neutralino is much lighter than that of gravitino .",
    "if the gravitinos have a relatively short lifetime , this mechanism will not destroy the success of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite .",
    "in this scenario , the light lsp with large wino component can be the good candidate for dark matter .",
    "however it should be pointed out that although this kind of lsp with large cross section could be produced in non - thermal process , it is also constrained by cosmological observations . for example , in the center of our galaxy , we may observe the signals of the dark matter annihilation @xcite due to their large cross sections .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite reported that if assuming an excess of microwave emission in the inner milky way is due to dark matter annihilation , the synchrotron measurements give constraint to the annihilation rate of neutralino .",
    "the constraint depends on the dark matter distribution profile .",

    "the residual annihilation of dark matter would produce @xmath35li during the bbn .",
