    "the significance of the @xmath3-component @xmath4 models with @xmath5 symmetric hamiltonian derives from the fact that they represent the most common  and probably also most important  universality classes of critical behaviour at bulk critical points of @xmath0-dimensional systems with short - range interactions .",
    "prominent examples of such universality classes for given @xmath0 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are those of the ising , xy , and isotropic heisenberg models , respectively .",
    "when such systems are bounded by free @xmath18-dimensional hyper - surfaces or walls , a wealth of distinct boundary critical phenomena can occur @xcite .",
    "a well - studied case are systems with a free surface that can be described by a semi - infinite @xmath3-component @xmath4  model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the latter is of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 mean volume and surface integrals over the half - space @xmath22 boundary hyperplane @xmath23 , respectively . provided neither bulk nor surface terms breaking the @xmath5  symmetry must be included , the bulk and surface densities are given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 furthermore , one can distinguish three different types of surface transitions that take place at the bulk critical temperature @xmath26 @xcite : they are called ordinary , special , and extraordinary surface transitions and occur , depending on whether @xmath27 is larger than , equal to , or smaller than a certain critical value @xmath28 .",
    "the extraordinary transition is a transition from a surface - ordered , bulk - disordered high - temperature phase to a low - temperature phase with long - range order both at the surface and in the bulk .",
    "it  and hence also the special transition  can occur only for those choices of @xmath0 and @xmath3 for which fluctuations do not destroy long - range order at the surface at all nonzero temperatures @xmath29 .",
    "this requires @xmath30 in the scalar case @xmath15 , and @xmath31 in the continuous - symmetry case @xmath32 .",
    "suppose @xmath3 and @xmath0 are such that all three of these transitions can occur .",
    "then the critical behaviour that surface quantities exhibit at any of these is representative of a separate surface universality class , although their bulk critical behaviour is the same .",
    "thus the bulk universality class associated with this choice of @xmath3 and @xmath0 splits into three distinct surface universality classes .    in the present paper",
    "we shall be concerned with the surface critical behaviour of @xmath3-vector systems at @xmath1-axial bulk lifshitz points .",
    "a lifshitz point ( lp ) is a multicritical point at which a disordered , a homogeneous ordered , and a modulated ordered phase meet @xcite .",
    "a family of natural extensions of the bulk models defined on @xmath33 by the bulk density ( [ eq : lbm0 ] ) that have such lps was introduced decades ago @xcite , but investigated in greater detail via field - theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) only in the past few years ( see the papers  @xcite and their references ) .",
    "their bulk density is given by @xmath34 where the position vector @xmath35 has the representation @xmath36 in euclidean coordinates @xmath37 .",
    "we use the convention that @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote coordinate indices @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "likewise , @xmath43 and @xmath44 mean the corresponding spatial derivatives @xmath45",
    ". at the level of landau theory , the model has a continuous transition from a disordered to a homogeneous ordered phase for @xmath46 at @xmath47 . for negative @xmath48 , a continuous transition to",
    "a modulated ordered phase occurs at a nonzero value of @xmath49 .",
    "the transition lines between these phases merge at @xmath50 , which is an @xmath1-axial lp within landau theory .    at lps",
    ", systems exhibit scale invariance of the _ strong anisotropic kind _ : coordinate difference @xmath51 within the @xmath38-subspace scale as a nontrivial power @xmath52 of the complementary ones @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , the anisotropy exponent , generally differs from @xmath55 , and in landau theory has the mean - field value @xmath56 .    owing to this anisotropic scale invariance , boundary critical phenomena at lps",
    "are richer than at critical points ( cps ) .",
    "for example , in the cp case , the orientation of the surface relative to the coordinate axes does not play any important role on the level of a description in terms of a @xmath4 field theory .",
    "however , for systems at lps the surface s orientation matters in an essential way , just as it does quite generally for systems with anisotropic scale invariance : two fundamentally distinct orientations can be distinguished ",
    "one for which all @xmath38-directions are parallel to the surface ( which we shall refer to as parallel ) , and another one for which the surface normal @xmath57 is along one of the @xmath1 @xmath38-directions ( which we shall refer to as perpendicular ) .    as a consequence of the different scaling behaviour of distances along @xmath38- and @xmath39-directions , it depends on whether the orientation of the surface is parallel or perpendicular which boundary contributions @xmath58",
    "are potentially infrared relevant below the upper critical dimension @xmath9 and hence must be included in the action .",
    "the problem of constructing semi - infinite extensions of the models with bulk density  ( [ eq : lb ] ) for @xmath59 that are _ `` minimal '' _ in the sense that all irrelevant and marginal boundary contributions not compatible with the presumed @xmath5 and euclidean - subspace may be ignored .",
    "when @xmath60 , spatial anisotropies lead , in particular , to non - isotropic bulk contributions of the form @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a tensor whose symmetry is that of an @xmath1-cube or lower .",
    "the @xmath63  results of reference  @xcite for the bulk model indicate that such terms are relevant in the infrared for @xmath64 . ]",
    "symmetries are discarded was considered for the case of parallel surface orientation in references  @xcite , where it was found that a contribution @xmath65 had to be included in the corresponding surface density @xmath66 , in addition to the one in equation  ( [ eq : l1m0 ] ) .",
    "the so - obtained semi - infinite model , defined by equation  ( [ eq : lb ] ) in conjunction with the boundary density @xmath67 was then utilized in references  @xcite and @xcite to determine the @xmath68  expansion of the surface critical exponents of the corresponding ordinary and special transitions to second and first order , respectively .",
    "this extends or complements previous work based on the mean - field approximation @xcite and monte carlo simulations for the axial - next - nearest - neighbour ising ( annni ) model @xcite .",
    "the model is a natural and simple - looking generalization of the semi - infinite @xmath3-vector model defined by equations  ( [ eq : lbm0 ] ) and ( [ eq : l1m0 ] ) , to which it reduces when @xmath69 .",

    "we shall consider the case of _ perpendicular _ surface orientation .",
    "previous work on it either was restricted to an investigation of the corresponding ordinary transition of the semi - infinite annni model on the level of the mean - field approximation @xcite , or else employed monte carlo simulations to study both the ordinary and special transitions of this model @xcite .",
    "our aim is to construct and analyze an appropriate minimal semi - infinite model for general values of @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "this turns out to be a greater challenge and more interesting than in the case of parallel surface orientation .",
    "since the classical equation of motion of the order - parameter profile now involves a differential equation of fourth order in @xmath79 , two rather than one boundary condition are required ( aside from two analogous ones at @xmath80 ) .",
    "furthermore , being an @xmath81 coordinate , @xmath82 now scales naively as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is an arbitrary momentum unit making @xmath85 dimensionless . compared to the case of parallel surface orientation ( where @xmath86 , power counting gives more potentially relevant or marginal surface terms .",
    "recently one of us has suggested an appropriate surface density @xmath87 and the associated boundary conditions @xcite . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we recall this density and derive the fluctuating boundary conditions it implies . using the latter , we show that the existing additional surface contributions that are compatible with symmetry and short - rangedness of interactions , and not irrelevant according to power counting , are redundant .    in section  [ sec : freeprop ]",
    "we determine the free propagator subject to these boundary conditions , at the lp for general values of the surface interaction constants .",
    "owing to its rather complicated form , explicit perturbative rg calculation for dimensions @xmath88 are difficult to perform with it . in section",
    "[ sec : bot ] we show , following a suggestion made in reference @xcite , how this problem can be by - passed to some extent in the case of the ordinary transition .",
    "the asymptotic large - scale behaviour at this transition can be argued to be described by a theory with boundary conditions @xmath89 hence one can work with the corresponding simplified free propagator at the price of having to deal with correlation functions involving besides the field @xmath6 also the boundary operator @xmath8 . from the anomalous dimension of the latter the required single independent surface critical exponent @xmath12 of this transition can be inferred . performing a one - loop rg analysis ,",
    "we compute in section  [ sec : rg ] the @xmath68  expansion of this exponent to @xmath90 for general values of @xmath1 .",
    "the result is used to estimate its value for the case @xmath14 of the three - dimensional semi - infinite annni model .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "finally , there is an appendix explaining how the required one - loop integral was calculated .",
    "while it is quite common to investigate field theories with dirichlet boundary conditions ( see @xcite and their references ) , we are not aware of previous studies of field theories satisfying the boundary conditions  ( [ eq : bcperp ] ) , barring familiar examples of hydrodynamic equations for fluids @xcite .",
    "it therefore not unlikely that the work described below might also be of interest for other problems .",

    "as an example , let us consider the surface susceptibility @xmath265 , the fourier @xmath266-transform of the response of @xmath267 with respect to a surface magnetic field @xmath268 . to characterize the asymptotic low - momentum behaviour of this quantity at the lp , we introduce the surface exponent @xmath269 by analogy with the cp case via @xmath270 where `` sing '' means singular part .",
    "( at the ordinary transition considered here , @xmath271 does not diverge but approaches a finite value . )    to identify @xmath269 , we apply the boe  ( [ eq : boelp ] ) to both external legs of @xmath272 , and exploit the behaviour  ( [ eq : czsol ] ) of the coefficient function together with the scaling forms of @xmath273 and @xmath221 implied by their rg equations .",

    "though these numbers are encouraging , our present knowledge of the series  ( [ eq : beta1annni ] ) to just first order in @xmath68 clearly is insufficient to produce estimates that are competitive in accuracy with this monte carlo value .",
    "we therefore refrain from giving further extrapolated values for other surface exponents .",
    "experience with the bulk case @xcite suggests that much better field - theoretic estimates should become possible once @xmath298 is known to @xmath299 . in view of the simplifications entailed by the approach developed here , such a two - loop calculation should not be too difficult .",
    "in this paper we have extended previous field - theoretic work on boundary critical behaviour at @xmath1-axial lps @xcite by studying the critical behaviour at the ordinary transition of a semi - infinite system that is bounded by a surface perpendicular to an @xmath38-direction . this geometry was the one considered in the earliest investigations @xcite of boundary critical behaviour at lps .",
    "however , to construct an appropriate minimal field - theory model and analyze it in a systematic fashion by means of modern rg method below the upper critical dimension turned out to be quite a challenge , mainly because significantly more potentially relevant ( short - range ) surface contributions must be considered than in the simpler case of where the surface is perpendicular to @xmath39-direction .",
    "taking up a suggestion made earlier @xcite , we found a way to by - pass the enormous technical difficulties one is faced with when having to carry along many surface interaction constants .",
    "the basic idea is to choose the boundary conditions  ( [ eq : bcperp ] ) the theory is expected to satisfy on long length - scales at the ordinary transition from the outset , showing that they _ correspond to a fixed point _ of the rg . while we have not investigated deviations from this fixed point associated with modification of these boundary conditions ( e.g. , finite values of the surface couplings @xmath191 and @xmath192 )",
    ", our results are completely consistent with the physically reasonable expectation that these boundary conditions are associated with a stable fixed point of the rg .",
    "the benefit of our procedure is twofold : ( i ) used in conjunction with the boe , the rg equations we obtained enabled us to derive scaling laws relating the surface critical exponents at this transition to bulk exponents and a single independent surface index , such as @xmath12 .",
    "( ii ) owing to the gain in technical simplification , an explicit one - loop calculation could be performed to obtain the @xmath68 expansion of @xmath12 and related surface exponents to first order . of course",
    ", one can not expect to get precise numerical estimates for the critical exponents at @xmath13 from such an @xmath90 result .",
    "nevertheless , the extrapolated values we obtained for @xmath12 in the case of the three - dimensional semi - infinite annni model by direct extrapolation to @xmath13 and via a [ 0/1 ] pad approximant agree reasonably well with recent monte carlo results @xcite ( albeit different numbers could be obtained if other scaling - law expressions for @xmath12 were employed in conjunction with the best estimates of reference  @xcite for the required bulk exponents ) .",
    "more reliable field - theoretic estimates should be possible on the basis of @xmath90 results .",
    "the required two - loop calculation appears to be quite manageable .",
    "a more difficult task is to perform an analogous two - loop rg analysis of the corresponding lp special transition .",
    "since this requires the identification of the associated fixed point in the space of surface coupling constants , one can not avoid retaining the dependence on these variables ( see the analysis of the special transition for the case of parallel surface orientation @xcite , for comparison ) .    from a more general perspective",
    ", the present investigation is , to our knowledge , the first one dealing beyond the classical level with a field theory subject to the two boundary conditions  ( [ eq : bcperp ] ) . both our way of investigating this field theory as well as our result that this boundary condition correspond to a stable fixed point of the rg might have applications in other contexts .",
