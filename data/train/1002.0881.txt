    "since the recognition that winds from the central stars of planetary nebulae ( pne ) play an important role in the shaping of these objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that only a small fraction of them show circular symmetry , the interest in pn morphology has triggered an active field in both theoretical and observational astronomy .",
    "many studies have been devoted to classify ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "nowadays , it is accepted that highly collimated outflows play a crucial role in the shaping of pne @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , other physical processes are probably present , so that most likely the shaping of pne is a result of many processes acting at the same time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to understand complex pne , the first step is to identify the structural components present and to define their nature .",
    "high - resolution , spatially resolved spectroscopy combined with narrow - band imaging has demonstrated to be a powerful tool to disentagle the structural components in pne , to infer their nature and to constraint the ejection processes involved in their formation @xcite .    although at first glance ngc7354 looks like an elliptical pn , extense h@xmath0 , [ ] @xmath13 , [ ] @xmath1 and mid - infrared imaging and spectroscopic data have revealed that it possess a more complex structure @xcite . in particular , @xcite described this nebula as consisting of an inner halo , a thin bright rim , two spike - like tails , and low - excitation patches projected onto the rim - halo interface .",

    "the [ nii ] emission from the outer shell is recognizable at slit positions 1,2,3,5 , and 6 .",
    "the emission is very faint and in the central nebular regions it appears superposed by the stronger emission from the inner shell",
    ". maximum radial velocity of @xmath11 35 kms@xmath12 is observed at the center and decreases with distance to the central star .",
    "emission from the outer shell can be recognized in the h@xmath0 line ( fig.6 ) by its spatial extend .",
    "however , the large thermal width and , probably , low expansion velocity in this line do not allow us to obtain detailed kinematic information .",
    "the outer shell can not be recognized in the long - slit spectra of the @xmath43 line .",
    "the inner shell can be identified at all slit positions in the three lines .",
    "the emission feature of the inner shell appears as a velocity ellipse in the pv maps .",
    "the size of the velocity ellipse is maximum at slit 8 with values of 30@xmath22 in h@xmath0 and [ ] , and 20@xmath22 in .",
    "maximum velocity splitting is observed at the center of the nebula ( slits 3 , 7 , and 8) and amounts 60 , 56 and 48 kms@xmath12 in h@xmath0 , [ ] , and , respectively .",
    "this implies expansion velocities for the inner shell of 30 , 28 and 24 kms@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "since we estimate an error of @xmath46kms@xmath12 in our velocity measurements , these results show that the emission is confined to a slow expanding , inner thin layer of the inner shell while the [ ] traces the outer layer that expands faster .",
    "it is worth noticing the very faint and wide emission observed in [ ] ( slit positions 2 , 3 , 7 and 8) located at about 12and 8to the north and south of the central star , respectively .",
    "the velocity of this faint emission spreads from @xmath47 to @xmath48kms@xmath12 .",
    "comparing our [ ] direct image and these particular pv maps , we identify these weak emissions with the two polar caps located on the main symmetry axis of the inner elliptical shell .",
    "all slit positions in our [ ] pv maps , show the presence of at least one of the bright low - ionization knots identified in our optical [ ] images ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , right panel ) . in all these pv maps",
    "we can see that most of them are located very close to the zero position line , i.e. almost on the equatorial plane of the nebula .",
    "although these pv maps show that emission arising from different bright knots may be mixed due to projection effects , we can estimate that their expansion velocity ranges between the inner and outer shell expansion velocities , 28kms@xmath12 to @xmath1140kms@xmath12 , with only two of them having lower velocities , @xmath1124kms@xmath12 .",
    "a final remark on the low - ionization knots is that in our [ ] pv maps , slit positions 1 and 6 , we can see two weak spots of emission almost simetrically located at about 14to the north and south from the central star , respectively .",
    "both emission spots show negative and very low velocities of @xmath49kms@xmath12 .",
    "we identify these two spots of emission as coming from two bright knots that , in projection , appear to be located on the outer shell wall ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ ] images ) .",
    "although [ ] emission from the two jet - like features can be identified at slit positions 2 and 5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , it can be better analyzed at slit positions 7 and 8 which were specially selected to cover these structures . in the corresponding pv maps we can see the conspicuous emission arising from the two jet - like features . while the north jet - like feature emission is slightly redshifted , the south feature is slightly blueshifted",
    "both features show a small radial velocity , between 0 and 5 km s@xmath12 which suggest that they are moving almost in the plane of the sky .",
    "as we have described , ngc7354 shows four different structures : two large scale structures , the outer and the inner shells , the last having two polar caps located on its symmetry axis ; a number of low - ionization bright knots lying about the equatorial plane , and two jet - like features located close to the north and south of the nebula , slightly inclined respect to the inner shell symmetry axis .",
    "our high dispersion spectra indicate that ( a ) the inner shell is expanding with a velocity which is smaller than that of the outer shell , ( b ) most of the bright equatorial knots are moving at velocities closer to the outer shell , and ( c ) the jets projected velocity is very small .    in order to test the overall morphology and kinematic structure of the nebula",
    "we have used the interactive three - dimensional ( 3d ) modeling tool shape ver .",
    "2.0 @xcite .",
    "shape produces synthetic images and pv diagrams which can be compared directly with our observed ccd images and pv maps .",
    "we have considered two ellipsoidal structures ( inner and outer shells ) , two spherical sections ( polar caps ) , several small spheres with different diameter ( bright knots ) and two geometrically thin cylinders of 2@xmath22 in diameter ( jet - like features ) .",
    "all these geometrical structures were slightly modified ( smoothered , lengthened and/or rounded ) in order to match the overall looking of our [ ] images . besides , all the structures were placed on the proper position to get the corresponding observed radial velocity from our pv maps .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows all the geometrical components used to construct our shape model .",
    "each one of the main structures was analized separately in order to obtain its spatial velocity independently .",
    "due to projection effects we are unable to distinguish neither if the low - ionization knots are located between the inner and outer shell nor if they are lying on the foreground or on the background side of the nebula .",
    "thus , we have assumed that the bright knots are located on the outer shell wall , according to their individual velocity shown in our pv map .",
    "it is important to remark that the inclination angle of the different structures is unknown and shape does not solve it .",
    "final geometrical and kinematic parameters are shown in table  [ tbl-5 ] .",
    "some of the inner shell basic parameters can be compared to those found by @xcite with an extended prolate ellipsoidal shell model . while our derived inclination and position angles are consistent with the ones determined by @xcite , our expansion velocity value is larger than theirs .",
    "however , as they have found in all the cases examined in their study , the [ ] gas has a larger expansion velocity than the [ ] gas .",
    "then , since we have determined the expansion velocity through the [ ] line emission , a difference in expansion velocities is expected .",
    "distance estimations found in the literature lie around 1.2kpc @xcite being 1.5kpc the largest estimation @xcite and 0.88kpc the smallest one @xcite .",
    "we have adopted the largest value of 1.5kpc in order to derive an upper limit for the kinematical ages . however , using a distance value of 1.2kpc implies a decrease in the kinematical age estimation of only 20% .",
    "but most important , distance uncertainty does not modify the proposed chronological sequence of structure formation in our model .    from this model",
    ", we have obtained synthetic images and pv diagrams which strongly resemble the observed ones , see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for an example of this good match .",
    "thus , from the proposed 3d model we have not only reproduced qualitatively the overall morphology of ngc7354 but we have also quantitatively reproduced the kinematic behaviour of each structure .      at present ,",
    "binary star models have been succesful in explaining the origin and process responsible for the equatorial density enhacement required in the interacting stellar wind ( isw ) model , or rather the generalized isw ( gisw ) model , to explain early- and middle - type elliptical and even bipolar large scale structures observed in pne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on one hand , common envelope ( ce ) evolution in close binaries has been proposed to be responsible for the expanding slow wind torus needed in gisw ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , accretion disks in binary systems seem to account for the narrow waist bipolar morphologies and even the jets present in pne .",
    "details may vary on each binary model in order to explain individual morphologies and structures , but in all of them the main idea is that of a jet launched by the central star , or its companion ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .",
    "since at first glance ngc7354 looks like a rather elliptical nebula , one may think that the single star models ( isw or gisw ) can explain the presence of the outer and inner shells , and even the formation of the two jet - like features observed in our [ ] image @xcite . however , it is unable to explain why all the different structures show different position angles ( pa s ) on the sky .",
    "this characteristic may indicate that the direction of ejection varies with time , and more likely that all the features were formed as independent events .",
    "although nowadays there is no evidence of ngc7354 possessing a binary nucleus , one may turn around and take a look at binary star models to try to understand in a consistent way the observed morphology of ngc7354 .",
    "it has been proposed that the gisw model coupled with the predictions of the ce evolution theory can account for the formation of elliptical and even bipolar pne morphologies @xcite .",
    "then , we could succesfully explain the outer and inner shells in ngc7354 based on this mixed model in the following way .",
    "after the ce phase has ended , i.e. the envelope has been ejected , the binary may become closer , mass transfer take place , an accretion disk is formed and a jet may be launched @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the subsequent evolution is similar to those described in the models for ppne @xcite it is possible that a jet arise from an accretion disk . then , the accretion disk theory would be able to explain also the two jet - like features observed in ngc7354 .",
    "moreover , some of these models even propose the formation of an expanding dense ring in the equatorial plane @xcite which in the case of ngc7354 might be related to the equatorial bright knots . as",
    "the nebula evolve , a combination of the processes and mechanisms just mentioned might take place .    with this in mind",
    ", we suggest a possible qualitative scenario for the formation of the main structures present in ngc7354 .",
    "a slow wind is lost by a central binary system ongoing a ce phase , producing the mild elliptical outer shell .",
    "when the agb fast wind begins , it finds an equatorial density enhaced enviroment forming the bright elliptical rim or inner shell . at this point",
    "the ce has been completely ejected and mass transfer from the secondary ( main - sequence star ) into the primary ( white dwarf ) will form an accretion disk and eventually a couple of jets will be launched .",
    "once the jets have appeared , they will `` push '' the polar ends of the inner shell , detaching them from it .",
    "eventually , the two jets would break the caps and escape from the main body of the nebula . along with",
    "the processes mentioned , the binary system may be precessing and each of the structures would show a different pa on the sky . in the case of the two jets",
    ", precession may cause that they impinge on the polar caps with a certain angle , i.e. not along the symmetry axis of the caps , breaking them apparently on the `` base '' of them . according to our derived kinematical ages ,",
    "the chronological sequence of formation seem to be consistent with the above description .",
    "the outer shell is the oldest structure present in the nebula with an age of about 2500yr .",
    "the next younger structure would be the inner elliptical shell with @xmath111600yr .",
    "kinematical ages for the two jet - like features indicate that they are coeval and both were formed almost at the same time as the inner elliptical shell .",
    "however , we should notice that the age was derived assuming that they have been moving with the same velocity ( 60 kms@xmath12 ) since their launch .",
    "according with the theory of formation of jets this low initial velocity would be very unlikely , since they arise from accelerated flowing material .",
    "then , more likely the jets possessed a higher initial velocity but they have been restrain along its way .",
    "maybe the main cause of this decceleration was the interaction of the jets with the polar caps .",
    "regarding the equatorial low - excitation bright knots , as we have mentioned above they may be related to the dense expanding ring formed around the binary system .",
    "the bright knots show velocities ranging between the inner and outer shell expansion velocities .",
    "this may indicate that they are moving with a similar velocity as the particular ambient gas in which they are embedded .",
    "we may compare these bright knots with the microstructures observed in ngc2392 ( eskimo nebula , * ? ? ? * ) and ngc7662 @xcite .",
    "although each one of these nebulae is seen with a different view angle ( ngc2392 is seen pole - on and ngc7662 is seen edge - on ) both of them show various low - ionization knots located beyond the inner structure and mainly on the outer envelope .",
    "if we compare the general morphology of ngc7354 with that observed in ngc2392 and ngc7662 one can see that the three of them show an ellipsoidal inner structure surrounded by on outer envelope with low - ionization bright knots located on the outer structure plus jet - like features , interpreted as fliers in the case of ngc7662 . in the case of ngc7354",
    "since it is observed with an edge - on view angle and it is inclined with respect to the plane of the sky , we are not able to observe the real morphology of the equatorial brights knots .",
    "however , one can imagine that if one could get a pole - on view , i.e. with the inner shell major axis aligned with our line of sight , one would see bright knots located in a zone between the inner and outer shell very alike the arragement of knots with tails observed in the eskimo nebula .",
    "therefore , having all these elements together , we suggest that , as in the cases of ngc7662 and ngc2392 , the equatorial bright knots observed in ngc7354 are not spherical structures but knots with tails , or even filamentary structures .",
    "this last suggestion is strongly supported by the high resolution [ ] hst image , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "a full model with mhd simulations is beyond the scope of the present study , but we are aware that it could clarify some aspects of our work .",
    "we have carried out a detailed morphological and kinematical analysis of the planetary nebula ngc7354 . in addition",
    ", we have derived the physical conditions and elemental abundances in 21 regions of the nebula .",

    "physical parameters of all the different structures show that there are slight variations , both in electron density and electron temperature , within the nebula . considering our error estimates ,",
    "while density seems to slightly increase inward from the outer shell border to the interior of the inner elliptical shell , temperature values seem to slightly increase in the same direction .",
    "equatorial bright knots are clearly denser that both shells with temperatures in the typical range for ionized gas . both jet - like features",
    "present a quite low density value and temperature was only determined for the south jet - like feature .",
    "all our derived physical parameter values are consistent with the ones expected for radiatively excited gas .",
    "local extinction values within the nebula show a slight increasing gradient going from south to north of the nebula and from west to east along the location of the equatorial knots .    based on our kinematical data",
    "we have obtained a model that consistently reproduce the overall as well as the detailed morphology and pv maps of the nebula , using the 3d interactive tool shape .",
    "the final geometrical components included in the model are : i ) two shells with similar inclination angle ( respect to our line of sight ) but different position angle of the projected semi - major axis ; ii ) two semispherical caps placed on the top of the inner elliptical shell ; iii ) thirteen spherical knots with different sizes , whose velocities spanned between the corresponding velocity values for the outer and inner shells , placed at different positions on the outer shell surface according to the optical image and observed spectra ; and iv ) two geometrically thin cylinders corresponding to north and south jet - like features .    finally ,",
    "although there is no evidence of binarity in ngc7354 at present , we suggest a qualitative scenario for the formation of the different structures in the nebula based on the theory of ce evolution and formation of accretion disks in binary systems found in the literature .    this project has been supported by grants from conacyt ( 49002 , 45848 ) and papiit - unam ( in111903 , in109509 ) .",

    "<S> we present an observational study of the planetary nebula ( pn ) ngc7354 consisting of narrow band h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath1 imaging as well as low and high dispersion long - slit spectroscopy and vla - d radio continuum . according to our imaging and spectroscopic data </S>",
    "<S> , ngc7354 has four main structures : a quite round outer shell and an elliptical inner shell , a collection of low - excitation bright knots roughly concentrated on the equatorial region of the nebula and two asymmetrical jet - like features , not aligned neither with the shells axes , nor with each other . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained physical parameters like electron temperature and electron density as well as ionic and elemental abundances for these different structures . electron temperature and electron density slightly vary throughout the nebula going from @xmath2 to @xmath3k , and from @xmath4 to @xmath5@xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the local extinction coefficient @xmath7 shows an increasing gradient from south to north and a decreasing gradient from east to west consistent with the number of equatorial bright knots present in each direction . </S>",
    "<S> abundance values show slight internal variations but most of them are within the estimated uncertainties . in general , </S>",
    "<S> abundance values are in good agreement with the ones expected for pne . </S>",
    "<S> radio continuum data are consistent with optically thin thermal emission . </S>",
    "<S> mean physical parameters derived from the radio emission are electron density @xmath8@xmath6 and @xmath9(hii)@xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have used the interactive three - dimensional modeling tool shape to reproduce the observed morphokinematic structures in ngc7354 with different geometrical components . </S>",
    "<S> our observations and model show evidence that the outer shell is moving faster ( @xmath11 35 kms@xmath12 ) than the inner one @xmath11 30 kms@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> our shape model includes several small spheres placed on the outer shell wall to reproduce to equatorial bright knots . observed and modeled velocity for these spheres lies between the inner and outer shells velocity values . </S>",
    "<S> the two jet - like features were modeled as two thin cylinders moving at a radial velocity of @xmath1160kms@xmath12 . in general </S>",
    "<S> , our shape model is in very good agreement with our imaging and spectroscopic observations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , after modeling ngc7354 with shape , we suggest a possible scenario for the formation of the nebula . </S>"
