    "since they are synchrotron emission , their presence indicates that cosmic - ray ( cr ) electrons are widely distributed in clusters .",
    "observationally , the relics appear to be associated with shocks created by cluster mergers @xcite , and thus diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) may be working there @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the halos may originate from electrons ( re)accelerated by cluster - wide turbulence excited by cluster mergers @xcite .",
    "they may also be produced by electrons created through hadronic interactions @xcite .",
    "the galaxy cluster 1rxs j0603.3@xmath04214 has a famous radio relic called `` toothbrush '' @xcite .",
    "thus , we call this cluster the `` toothbrush cluster '' from now on .",

    "moreover , the position of the relic does not seem to coincide with that of the shock @xcite .",
    "these facts suggest that the cr electrons responsible for the relic are not accelerated through the dsa mechanism , although projection effects of multiple shocks may account for them ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .    the merging cluster 1e  0657@xmath156 is known as the `` bullet cluster '' , because a small cluster ( `` bullet '' ) is passing through a large cluster with a velocity of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations show that this cluster has a prominent shock with a mach number of @xmath4 ahead of the bullet . behind the shock",
    ", a large radio halo is developing @xcite .",
    "however , despite of the relatively large mach number , a radio relic has not been found at the position of the shock in this cluster .",
    "this seems to contradict the fact that @xmath5 is a normal value for the development of a relic at a shock @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility that the relic in the toothbrush cluster is mainly associated with turbulence developed _ behind _ a shock",
    ". this may contradict the common idea that radio relics are basically generated by the dsa and radio halos are generated by the turbulent reacceleration . in our model ,",
    "cr electrons weakly accelerated at the shock are significantly reaccelerated in the turbulence ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , the dsa at the shock only provides seed cr electrons that are reaccelerated in the turbulence .",
    "since the shock is weak , the radio emission at the shock is not strong .",
    "however , if the turbulent reacceleration is effective enough , the radio emission from the reaccelerated electrons can be strong , and the spectrum can be harder than the prediction of the dsa model . moreover , the difference of the position of the shock and the relic in the toothbrush cluster can naturally be explained .",
    "we also consider the bullet cluster as an extreme case of our model .",
    "that is , the reacceleration is so effective that the emission from the reaccelerated electrons , which is observed as a radio halo , obscures a possible radio relic at the shock .",
    "we assume that electrons accelerated at a shock are reaccelerated by turbulence in the downstream of the shock . for a given upstream gas density @xmath6 , an upstream velocity @xmath7 on the shock frame , and a mach number @xmath8 , the downstream density and the velocity are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , where @xmath11 is the shock compression ratio and @xmath12 is the adiabatic index . for a given temperature @xmath13 of the upstream , that of the downstream is written as @xmath14 [ ( \\gamma_g-1){\\cal m}^2 + 2]}{(\\gamma_g+1)^2{\\cal m}^2}\\:.\\ ] ] we assume a planar shock .",
    "the momentum spectrum of electrons accelerated through the dsa mechanism at the shock is @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xcite . here",

    "thus , the energy density of cr electrons just downside of the shock is @xmath24 . on the other hand , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the lorentz factor for the particles",
    "thus , @xmath27    in the downstream of the shock , electrons are reaccelerated in turbulence and the spectrum changes as a function of time , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the evolution is dictated by the fokker - planck equation , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the diffusion coefficient in momentum for scattering .",

    ", it is often assumed that @xmath39 is the coulomb mean free path of thermal particles @xmath40 ( e.g. @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , which depends on @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in this study , we treat @xmath39 as a free parameter represented by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the reduction factor ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 is the reference momentum , and @xmath47 is the parameter that represents the property of the turbulence .",

    "for the parameters we adopted , the pressure of the magnetic fields just behind of the shock , @xmath72 , is smaller than the thermal pressure there .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath59 are degenerated for reacceleration because both smaller @xmath73 and larger @xmath74 result in higher efficiency of reacceleration ( equations  [ eq : dpp ] and  [ eq : dxx ] ) , although @xmath59 affects synchrotron cooling . the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath23 determine the size of the turbulent region and the normalization of the cr spectrum , respectively .",

    ", the electrons are reaccelerated , which continues until @xmath76  myr . at this stage",
    ", the electron spectrum becomes harder .",
    "after that , the reacceleration weakens owing to the decay of the turbulence and radiative cooling dominates the reacceleration . as a result , the number of high - energy electrons ( @xmath77 ) decreases .",
    "figure  [ fig : tooth]b presents the integrated synchrotron flux of the relic .",
    "we assume that the relic as a whole is stationary and both the relic s width and the depth along the line of sight are 500  kpc .",
    "the spectrum is not represented by a single power law and is broadly consistent with the observation @xcite",
    ".    figure  [ fig : tooth]c shows the synchrotron surface brightness at 1382  mhz as the function of the distance from the shock @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that the shock normal is perpendicular to the line of sight and that the depth of the radio relic along the line of sight is 500  kpc . for comparison ,",
    "we show the observation of the west part of the toothbrush at the same frequency @xcite .",
    "the position of the shock is set at the position indicated by the x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "our model can reproduce the observed sharp increase of the brightness behind the shock ( @xmath78  kpc ) .",
    "the peak of the position is determined by the acceleration time , @xmath79 . at @xmath80 and @xmath81 ,",
    "the timescale is @xmath82  myr , and the spatial scale is @xmath83  kpc . since @xmath84 increases as @xmath32 increases and @xmath31 decreases , the position of the peak ( @xmath78  kpc ) is a factor of two larger than @xmath85 .",
    "we note that the position of the peak is closer to the shock compared with the observations ( @xmath86400  kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "this may indicate that it takes some time for the turbulence to develop behind the shock and that the reacceleration is delayed . or there may be an error for the position of the weak shock .",
    "in fact , recent _ chandra _ observations suggest that the shock is located just at the northern edge of the relic but not at the peak @xcite , which is consistent with figure  [ fig : tooth]c because the observed radio profile ( dotted line ) should be shifted to the left by @xmath87200  kpc . in figure  [ fig : tooth]c , we also plot the spectral index of the radio emission , which is measured between 147 and 2272  mhz . at @xmath80 ( @xmath88 ) ,",
    "the index is predicted by the standard dsa model , @xmath89 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath90 here .",
    "the index increases up to @xmath91 at the peak of the surface brightness , which is consistent with the observations ( fig .  8 in @xcite ) .",
    "note that the rapid decrease of the index just behind the shock is caused by radiative cooling before reacceleration becomes effective . on the other hand , the diffuse emission observed at @xmath92  kpc",
    "can not be reproduced by our model .",
    "this suggests that the turbulence does not completely decay , and weak reacceleration continues there .",
    "we note that polarization has been detected at the relic of the toothbrush cluster @xcite .",
    "this may be related to compression of large - scale magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : surf_t2 ] shows the results when @xmath93 and @xmath94 ; the other parameters are the same as the fiducial model .",
    "the larger @xmath73 means that the turbulent reacceleration is less effective than that in the fiducial model .",
    "we compensate the inefficiency with the larger @xmath23 .",
    "although this model can reproduce the surface brightness at the peak , the spectral index is much smaller than the observations ( @xmath91 ; @xcite ) because of the weaker reacceleration .",
    "these show that the reduction factor must be small enough to explain both observations of surface brightness and spectral index .",
    "the fiducial parameters for the bullet cluster are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98  kev , which are based on the x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "other fiducial parameters are @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "these parameters are chosen so that the results are consistent with radio observations ( see below ) . the magnetic pressure is smaller than the thermal pressure .",
    "since the radio emission covers the whole cluster @xcite , we expect that turbulence is developing in the whole cluster and the decay scale is much larger than that of the toothbrush cluster .",
    "thus , we simply assume that the reduction factor is constant ( @xmath101 ) , and it is @xmath102 .",
    "the coulomb mean free path in the downstream is @xmath103  kpc .",
    "figure  [ fig : bullet]a shows the evolution of the electron momentum spectrum .",
    "compared to figure  [ fig : tooth]a , the initial spectrum is harder because of the larger mach number ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "as the electrons are reaccelerated , the peak at @xmath105@xmath106 becomes prominent .",
    "although radiative cooling gradually becomes effective , turbulent acceleration compensates the effect . for @xmath107  myr",
    ", the spectrum does not much change because the acceleration balances with the cooling .",
    "figure  [ fig : bullet]b shows the synchrotron spectrum of the whole cluster , which is not represented by a power law because it reflects the shape of the momentum spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bullet]a ) .",
    "we assume that the radio halo s length is @xmath108  mpc .",
    "both the width and the depth along the line of sight are 500  kpc .",
    "the normalization of the synchrotron spectrum depends on the assumed geometry of the radio - emitting region .",
    "figure  [ fig : bullet]c shows the profile of surface brightness as a function of the distance from the shock .",
    "we simply assume that the position of the shock is at the tip of the observed radio emission ( fig .  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "although our prediction does not perfectly reproduce the observed profiles , it reproduces the general trend , such as a steep rise behind the shock and a fairly flat profile after that .",
    "we note that the actual cluster is very complicated .",
    "for example , there is a bullet or a sharp x - ray peak at @xmath109  kpc @xcite , and the turbulence is not expected to be uniform behind the shock .",
    "thus , it would be useless to fine - tune parameters in our simple model in order to perfectly reproduce the observations .",
    "the spectral index at @xmath80 is @xmath110 ( equation  [ eq : alpha ] ) . for @xmath111  kpc ,",
    "the index is almost constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bullet]c ) .",
    "the average index ( @xmath112 ) is consistent with the observations @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that the surface brightness starts to rise at @xmath113  kpc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bullet]c ) , and the gap between the shock and the rising point is smaller than the resolution of the current radio telescope ( @xmath114  kpc ; @xcite ) . at @xmath80 and @xmath81 ,",
    "the acceleration time and the spacial scale are @xmath115  myr and @xmath116  kpc , respectively , which are comparable to those for the toothbrush cluster .",
    "observations with a higher resolution in the future are especially important to reveal the turbulent reacceleration just behind the shock because the rising point reflects the efficiency of the reacceleration that depends on parameters such as @xmath53 and @xmath117 .",
    "the gap is smaller and the spectrum is harder if @xmath53 is smaller and/or if @xmath36 is larger because acceleration is more efficient .",
    "the mach number of the shock observed in the bullet cluster is relatively large ( @xmath118 ; @xcite ) , and it is comparable to that of the shock observed in ciza  j2242.8@xmath05301 @xcite , at which a sharp radio relic called `` sausage '' has been observed @xcite .",
    "in contrast with ciza  j2242.8@xmath05301 ( the sausage cluster hereafter ) , however , no bow - like radio structure featuring a relic has been observed in the bullet cluster .",
    "this means that a mach number is not the only factor that determines radio morphology . in order to find the reason , we try to reproduce the sausage - like structure with minimum changes of the parameters from the fiducial model .",
    "figure  [ fig : surf_b2 ] shows the profile of the surface brightness when @xmath119 and @xmath120 ; other parameters are the same as in the fiducial model for the bullet .",
    "the larger values of @xmath53 and @xmath23 mean that while the turbulent reacceleration is less efficient , the shock acceleration is more efficient . in figure",
    "[ fig : surf_b2 ] , the radio emission peaks at the shock ( @xmath80 ) and rapidly decreases at @xmath121 , which are the properties of the dsa model and are similar to the radio relic in the sausage cluster @xcite , although the parameters are not chosen to precisely reproduce the sausage cluster .",
    "this suggests that the difference between the bullet cluster and the sausage cluster reflects the difference of contribution between the reacceleration in the turbulence , which depends on @xmath53 , and the acceleration at the shock , which depends on @xmath23 . in other words , the results for the fiducial parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bullet ] ) indicate that the emission from the radio halo obscures that from the relic at the shock .",
    "what makes the differences of radio emissions among the toothbrush cluster , the bullet cluster , and the sausage cluster ? the results in section  [ sec : result ] show that @xmath53 and @xmath23 can be the key parameters to explain them together ; the former reflects the reacceleration efficiency in the turbulence and the latter reflects the dsa efficiency at the shock .",
    "we speculate that there are three elements that determine @xmath53 and @xmath23 ; development of turbulence , the mach number of shocks , and preexisting crs .    in our study ,",
    "the difference of radio profiles between the toothbrush cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tooth]c ) and the bullet cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bullet]c ) is mainly caused by the difference of @xmath44 , which reflects the decay of turbulence .",
    "one possible reason may be disruption of a cool core .",
    "if a fast - moving core is being violently destroyed through interaction with the ambient medium , strong turbulence may develop .",
    "this may be the case of the bullet cluster @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the toothbrush cluster does not seem to have a breaking cool core @xcite .",
    "this may be one reason that strong turbulence is not developing in the central region .",
    "the mass ratio of subcluster components in a merging cluster may be a clue .",
    "for the bullet cluster , the ratio is expected to be around 1 : 0.1 @xcite .",
    "weak - lensing analysis showed that the gas component of the smaller mass component ( bullet ) is decoupled from its dark matter component , and the shape of the shock front appears to be irrelevant to the dark matter distribution @xcite .",
    "thus , the gravitational potential of the smaller component could not hold its gas and cool core .",
    "the toothbrush cluster may be formed through mergers of three clusters with the mass ratio of 1 : 1 : 0.07 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "if their mergers are asymmetric , gas motion in the cluster may be complicated and possible strong turbulence associated with the smallest component may not develop at the cluster center . at the present , only weak turbulence may remain at the center , and the radio emission from crs accelerated by the turbulence may be observed as a diffuse halo at @xmath122  kpc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tooth]c ) . for the sausage cluster",
    ", @xcite recently showed that the mass ratio of two components of the cluster is 1 : 0.5 and that the curved shapes of the two radio relics well match the density contours of the dark matter .",
    "that is , the gas distribution fairly follows the dark matter distribution .",
    "these may indicate that the mass similarity of the two components may prevent one - sided destruction of the smaller component and development of strong turbulence .",
    "of course , if the mass ratio is too large , the smaller component hardly affects the main cluster .",
    "thus , a moderate mass ratio may be preferable for development of turbulence .",
    "our study suggests that the relic of the toothbrush cluster is not basically a result of the dsa , in contrast with the sausage cluster .",
    "their different mach numbers might be responsible for that .",
    "for example , @xcite indicated that cr acceleration efficiency drops at @xmath123 .",
    "thus , the relic of the toothbrush cluster ( @xmath124 ) may not satisfy a necessary condition of effective dsa acceleration ( @xmath125 ) . on the other hand , the mach numbers for the bullet cluster and the sausage cluster satisfy this condition .",
    "their difference of radio morphology may reflect existence or nonexistence of seed cr electrons _",
    "ahead _ of the shocks @xcite . the normalization of the cr spectrum at the shock , @xmath23 , for figure  [ fig : surf_b2 ] is @xmath106 times larger than that for figure  [ fig : bullet ] .",
    "this may mean that effective dsa acceleration is required for a relic to be bright at the shock like the sausage cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : surf_b2 ] ) .",
    "the preexisting cr electrons may enhance the efficiency @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if there are few preexisting cr electrons , the efficiency is small and the radio emission is dim at the shock .",
    "however , if strong turbulence is developed behind the shock , even the electrons with small energies are effectively reaccelerated and may form a radio halo ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bullet ] ) .",
    "we have investigated the origin of radio relics on the periphery of galaxy clusters .",
    "we focus on the turbulent reacceleration of cr electrons that had been weakly accelerated at a shock .",
    "we considered alfvn waves as scatterers of the cr electrons .",
    "we found that the effective mean free path of the particles must be much smaller than the coulomb mean free path for efficient reacceleration .",
    "this may be realized if the turbulence cascades to the smaller scale or plasma instabilities excite waves at that small scale . using our model , we reproduced the hard spectrum of the relic observed in the cluster 1rxs j0603.3@xmath04214 ( the toothbrush cluster ) , which can not be explained by the standard dsa model . in our model , the position of the relic does not coincide with that of the shock .",
    "the difference of the positions has actually been observed in the toothbrush cluster .",
    "our results show that for some relics turbulent reacceleration may be the main mechanism to produce high - energy electrons , although the turbulent reacceleration is generally associated with giant radio halos .",
    "we also applied our model to the merging cluster 1e  0657@xmath156 ( the bullet cluster ) , in which a radio relic has not been found in spite of the large mach number of the bow shock .",
    "we showed that strong turbulence behind the shock can reaccelerate cr electrons .",
    "the bright synchrotron emission from those electrons is observed as a radio halo and it obscures a possible radio relic at the shock . if the acceleration of the shock were more efficient and the reacceleration in the turbulence were less efficient , a sharp radio relic should have been observed in the bullet cluster as in ciza 2242.8@xmath05301 ( the sausage cluster ) .",
    "our results suggest that various radio relics and halos in clusters can be explained all together by only two factors : the reacceleration efficiency in the turbulence and the dsa efficiency at the shock .",
    "we speculate that development of turbulence , the mach number of shocks , and preexisting crs determine those two factors .",
