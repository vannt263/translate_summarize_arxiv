    "in the past 25 years , milgrom s proposed alternative to dark matter , the modified newtonian dynamics or mond @xcite , has enjoyed considerable phenomenological success with respect to galaxy scaling relations and individual rotation curves ( see sanders & mcgaugh 2002 for a review ) .",
    "the range of this predictive power has recently been extended from very low luminosity objects @xcite to luminous early - type spirals @xcite . however , for some time it has been recognised that mond does not fully account for the mass discrepancy in rich clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is basically because , with mond , the departure from newtonian dynamics appears below a critical acceleration , @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 determined from galaxy rotation curves is about @xmath3 cm / s@xmath4 . in clusters of galaxies ,",
    "the observed acceleration ( estimated from the hydrostatic gas equation ) is typically greater than @xmath2 in the central regions , so mond can not alleviate the observed discrepancy there . when the mond version of the hydrostatic gas equation is applied to the observed temperature and density distributions in x - ray emitting clusters of galaxies",
    ", one finds that there remains a discrepancy roughly of a factor of three between the identifiable baryonic mass in gas and stars and the dynamical mass .",
    "that is to say , mond also requires the presence of undetected , or dark , matter in clusters of galaxies , albeit significantly less than conventional newtonian dynamics .",
    "x - ray and weak lensing observations of the famous `` bullet cluster '' @xcite are now presented as definitive evidence for non - dissipative dark matter in clusters of galaxies and , by extension , as evidence against mond . had it been previously claimed that mond fully accounts for the kinematic and x - ray observations of clusters without dark matter , then this object would indeed have been quite problematic for the theory .",
    "but , in fact , the bullet creates no _ additional _ difficulties for mond ; the quantity of dark matter required is consistent with that suggested by the previous analyses ( angus et al . 2007 ) .",
    "what the bullet cluster adds ( and this is a significant addition ) is convincing evidence that the dark component can not be dissipative like the extended x - ray emitting gas .    at first thought , it might appear negative for mond that additional dark matter is required in the cluster environment .",
    "but one could also consider this to be a bold prediction that there is more matter to be discovered in clusters .",
    "for example , there are more than enough undetected baryons to make up the missing dark component ; they need only be present in some non - dissipative form which is difficult to observe .",
    "moreover , it is now known that at least two of the three active neutrino types have non - zero mass @xcite .",
    "primordial neutrinos are present in the universe with a number density comparable to that of photons , so non - baryonic dark matter certainly exists .",
    "if the neutrino mass scale is as large as 2 ev , then neutrinos would comprise a non - baryonic component of rich clusters @xcite , but because of phase space constraints @xcite they could not accumulate in individual galaxies .",
    "@xmath1 decay experiments have restricted the mass of the electron neutrino to be less than about 2.2 ev , so it remains possible that this is the appropriate mass scale @xcite .",
    "the addition of cosmological neutrinos with mass of this order produces a reasonable fit to the observed angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation , through the second peak , without the presence of cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , here i consider further the possibility that the missing component in clusters of galaxies in the context of mond may be neutrinos .",
    "i demonstrate that the form of correlations between observable quantities the size - temperature relation ( @xmath5 ) and the gas mass - temperature relation ( @xmath6 ) are consistent with mond expectations without any additional astrophysical mechanism other than violent relaxation .",
    "however , the luminosity - temperature relation ( @xmath7 ) is not consistent with mond by itself ; an additional dark component seems to be required @xcite .    for a sample of well - studied clusters ,",
    "the mond dynamical mass is proportional to but a factor of three or four times larger than the observable gas mass .",
    "this suggests that the detectable baryonic mass is a fixed fraction of the dark mass .",
    "if the mass of each active neutrino type is about 2 ev , then the ratio of neutrino to baryonic cosmological mass densities would be about 2.8 , consistent with the inferred ( via mond ) ratio of gas to dark matter in clusters .",
    "i consider the structure of two - component isothermal objects consisting of neutrinos and gas .",
    "the neutrino fluid is described by the equation of state of partially degenerate fermions , where the degree of degeneracy in the centre is arbitrarily set to a specified value . because the maximum density of neutrinos is proportional to @xmath0 this means that , in a uniformly mixed two - component fluid , the central gas density would also be proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "this appears to be the case in non - cooling flow clusters where there has been no inward flow of gas resulting in a rearrangement of the cosmological density ratio of baryons - to - neutrinos . with such models ,",
    "the observed luminosity- temperature scaling relation for clusters is recovered primarily because @xmath8 .",
    "i then consider individual clusters with the two - fluid model . after specifying the mass scale of the neutrinos and the degree of degeneracy in the centre",
    ", i assume that the presumably constant neutrino velocity dispersion is equal to that of the gas as implied by the mean emission - weighted gas temperature .",
    "given the observed gas density distribution ( via @xmath1-model fits to the x - ray intensity distribution ) i calculate the radial dependence of the gas temperature which is consistent with this density distribution .",
    "the only free parameter is the central gas temperature which must lie in a narrow range in order to yield a sensible temperature distribution ( one in which the temperature does not rapidly increase to large values or fall to zero ) .",
    "these calculated temperature distributions are found to be generally consistent with those now observed a slowly decreasing temperature for non - cooling flow clusters , and a temperature which first increases with radius and then decreases for cooling flow clusters .",
    "i conclude that the two - fluid neutrino - baryon model for clusters of galaxies in the context of mond , is consistent both with the correlations between observable quantities and with the observed density and temperature distributions in individual clusters .    in all that follows",
    "i have scaled observational results and correlations to @xmath9 km / s - mpc .",
    "it is of interest to consider correlations between the observed , and not the inferred , properties of x - ray emitting clusters of galaxies .",
    "one of the most obvious correlations is that between the cluster size ( out to a specified x - ray intensity level ) and the temperature of the hot gas .",
    "mohr et al . ( 2000 ) find that this relation , for nearby clusters , is : @xmath10 with a surprisingly low scatter of about 15% .",
    "the expectation for self - similar collapse is more like @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "mohr et al .",
    "explain the difference between the observations and the expectations by noting that the fraction of gas ( as opposed to the total baryonic fraction including the luminous matter in galaxies ) appears to increase with cluster temperature . while this seems to be a general trend @xcite , the observed relationship between gas mass / total baryonic mass and temperature exhibits enormous scatter .",
    "it is unclear how such a tight correlation can survive .    in terms of mond , eq .",
    "1 takes on a different meaning . the mean internal gravitational acceleration in clusters",
    "is given roughly by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the velocity dispersion and proportional to temperature ) .",
    "then we may interpret eq .  1 as defining a single characteristic internal acceleration which is independent of cluster size or temperature ; i.e. , @xmath15 cm / s@xmath4 .",
    "this is within a factor of two of the mond critical acceleration ( @xmath16 cm / s@xmath4 ) .",
    "it has been pointed out previously that in pressure supported , nearly isothermal systems , the internal acceleration is approximately the mond acceleration @xcite .",
    "viewed in this way , the cluster temperature - size relation simply reflects that characteristic internal acceleration and requires no astrophysical input other than the requirement of a near isothermal state , presumably due to violent relaxation .",
    "a second correlation is that between the temperature and the observed gas mass .",
    "mohr et al . ( 1999 ) give @xmath17 for self - similar collapse , making use of the newtonian virial theorem , the expectation would be @xmath18 .",
    "the disagreement between observations and expectations is again attributed to a systematically changing fraction of baryons in hot gas perhaps resulting from increasing energy injection into the intra - cluster medium or a decreased efficiency of galaxy formation in hotter clusters .    with mond",
    ", however , eq .  2 would be the expectation from the dynamics of isothermal ( or semi - isothermal ) spheres ; it is , in effect , an extrapolation of the faber - jackson relation for elliptical galaxies @xcite and , in the case of mond would apply to all pressure supported , near isothermal systems @xcite .",
    "basically , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium in the mond regime yields @xmath19 for the total dynamical mass in terms of mond . here",
    "i have assumed an isothermal @xmath1-model with an outer logarithmic density gradient of @xmath20 where @xmath21 on average .",
    "although the form of the temperature - gas mass relation is predicted , the normalisation is not ; the mond dynamical mass implied by eq .  3 is roughly 3.6 times larger than the observed gas mass .",
    "the third correlation , and the most discussed in the literature , is that between luminosity and temperature . again the correlation is well - fitted by a power - law ;",
    "for example , ikebe et al . (",
    "2002 ) give @xmath22 for the total x - ray luminosity between energies of 0.1 to 2.4 kev .",
    "others find exponents closer to 3 with suggestion of a steepening for cooler clusters @xcite .",
    "the expectation for self similar cluster formation in the context of cdm is a shallower power law @xmath23 . here",
    ", preheating of the intergalactic medium ( heating before cluster formation ) by winds from forming galaxies is invoked to to provide an `` entropy floor '' for the subsequent intra - cluster medium ( entropy is defined as @xmath24 ) .",
    "this would have the effect of inflating the the intra - cluster medium particularly in lower temperature galaxies and steepening the predicted luminosity - temperature relation @xcite .",
    "mond , in this case , fairs worse . in mond",
    "a virialized system has a characteristic density @xmath25 . as we saw above",
    ", the characteristic radius of the cluster is @xmath26 . for free - free radiation , @xmath27 ; therefore , the naive prediction would be @xmath28 .",
    "i discussed this point previously ( sanders 2003 ) and noted that a dark matter component with a constant density and a core radius roughly twice that of the gas core radius could bring the mond prediction in line with the observations .",
    "mond predicts more mass than is directly observed in clusters of galaxies .",
    "determination of the magnitude of this discrepancy , however , is not straightforward . for an isothermal gas ,",
    "the hydrostatic gas equation in the mond limit implies that the mass within radius r is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mean atomic weight , @xmath31 is the proton mass , and @xmath32 is the logarithmic density gradient evaluated at r. the gas density distribution is typically described by the @xmath1 model used to fit the x - ray surface brightness distribution : @xmath33^{-1.5\\beta}.\\eqno(6)\\ ] ] therefore beyond three or four core radii @xmath34 i.e. , the predicted dynamical mass converges . on the other hand , @xmath35 which means that the gas mass continues to increase with radius ( the @xmath1 model surely must have a limited range of viability ) .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of the discrepancy ( defined as @xmath36 ) , as estimated from the @xmath1 model , decreases with radius ; i.e. , the discrepancy depends upon the radius within which the estimate is made .",
    "i have determined the mond dynamical mass and gas mass for a well - studied sample of clusters given by reiprech & bhringer ( 2002 ) .",
    "i make use of the radius - temperature relation to estimate the cutoff radius , but i take this limiting radius to be about 20% larger than that given by eq .  1 .",
    "this implies that the cutoff is , on average , about six core radii which is a probable range of validity for the @xmath1 model fit .",
    "since the accelerations in the central regions of the clusters are typically on the order of @xmath2 , the form of the mond interpolating function plays a role ; here i take the simple form suggested by zhao and famaey ( 2005 ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xmath39 . the mond dynamical mass is then given by @xmath40 where the newtonian mass is @xmath41 .",
    "the gas is only a fraction of the total baryonic mass the remainder being in the form of stars in galaxies .",
    "as before , i take the ratio of intra - cluster gas to stellar mass as given by @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "there is considerable scatter about this approximate relation .",
    "the result of this analysis is shown in fig .  1 which is a plot of the mond dynamical mass against the inferred baryonic mass out to a limiting radius given by @xmath43 kpc",
    ". the ratio of the mond dynamical mass to the baryonic mass is , on average , 3.7 with no significant difference between the cooling flow and non - cooling flow galaxies .",
    "that is to say , the observed baryonic mass in clusters accounts for one - third to one - forth of the mond dynamical mass .",
    "it is evident from fig .  1 that the ratio of dynamical to baryonic mass is roughly independent of the baryonic mass .",
    "there is an indication of a deviation at low values of the baryonic mass possibly because of an increased fraction of matter in the stellar component of galaxies , but overall , the points lie parallel to the line of equality .",
    "this is of interest because it suggests that a fixed cosmic ratio of dark to baryonic matter may be sampled by the cluster medium .",
    "if neutrinos are more massive than a few tenths of an electron volt , then , because of the small mass differences , all types have about the same mass . the cosmological density of neutrinos would then be given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mass of a single neutrino type in ev . in this relation",
    "i have assumed three left - handed neutrino types and their anti - particles , but the formula would apply for majorana as well as dirac neutrinos .",
    "given that the cosmological density of baryons is @xmath46 ( e.g. spergel et al .",
    "2006 , with h=0.72 ) , this means that @xmath47 if we suppose that clusters of galaxies sample this universal neutrino- baryon density ratio then the dynamical mass - to - baryonic mass ratio implied by fig .",
    "1 would mean that @xmath48 ev .",
    "cosmological neutrinos freeze out of the primordial fireball below temperatures characteristic of the weak interaction scale of a few mev .",
    "the phase space distribution is fermi - dirac with a maximum for each species of one particle per cell with volume @xmath49 ; i.e. , one - half that of complete degeneracy .",
    "this initial phase space density is maintained as a limit on the final phase space density of any collapsed virialized object ( tremaine & gunn 1979 ) ; of course , the degeneracy limit is absolute .    in the formation of a cluster scale object out of the mixed fluid of neutrinos and baryons ,",
    "it is expected that the two fluids attain the same velocity dispersion via violent relaxation @xcite . with this assumption ,",
    "the maximum contribution of each neutrino type ( including its anti - particle ) to the density of the neutrino fluid is @xmath50 @xcite . for three neutrino types ( and their anti - particles ) this translates to a mass density of @xmath51}^4   { t_{kev}}^{3/2 } { \\rm gcm^{-3 } } \\eqno(11)\\ ] ] if the ratio of the densities of baryons and neutrinos in clusters is the same as the cosmological ratio ( eq .",
    "9 ) , this means that the density of electrons , in a fully ionised plasma , would be @xmath52}^3   { t_{kev}}^{3/2 } { \\rm cm^{-3}}. \\eqno(12)\\ ] ]    therefore , if the ratio of baryon to neutrino densities in clusters is identical to the cosmic ratio , as one might expect if there has been no subsequent cooling and inflow of baryons , then the central electron density should increase as @xmath0 .",
    "this is an observational prediction which can be tested , and in fig .  2 we see the central electron density of in the cluster sample of reiprech & bhringer plotted against the mean electron temperature .",
    "the solid points indicate those clusters where the cooling time is more than @xmath53 years ( non - cooling flow clusters ) and the crosses are those clusters with cooling timescales less than this value ( cooling flow clusters ) .",
    "the solid line is eq .  12 with @xmath54 ev .",
    "we see that in those objects where no cooling and inflow of gas is expected where the cosmic ratio of baryons to neutrinos is maintained there does appear to be such a correlation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the electron density - temperature relation imposed by the neutrino density limit and the assumption of fixed baryon - to - neutrino ratio ( eq .",
    "12 ) would also correspond to a constant entropy , @xmath24 .",
    "imposing such a temperature dependent limit on the electron density is equivalent to imposing an entropy floor .",
    "_ this is , in fact , the very mechanism which has been suggested as to steepen the predicted luminosity - temperature relation , but here the limit is not generated by preheating but by the phase space constraints on the neutrino fluid .",
    "_ it is interesting that the entropy limit corresponding to eq .",
    "12 would be 230 kev cm@xmath4 for @xmath56 ev which is very near the value proposed to solve problem of cluster scaling relations @xcite .    before considering the implications for the luminosity - temperature relation",
    "it is necessary to describe , in a general way , the structure of a self - gravitating object consisting entirely of neutrinos near the degeneracy limit .",
    "the object can be approximated as a @xmath57 polytrope ; the structure would be roughly that of a constant density core with a rapid decline beyond a core radius .",
    "the core radius can be estimated by combining the density temperature relation ( eq.10 or 11 ) with an appropriate temperature - mass ( or viral relation ) .",
    "there are two such possible relations .",
    "the first , for newtonian dynamics , is @xmath58 where @xmath14 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , and i have taken the potential energy of a @xmath57 polytropic sphere .",
    "the second is for modified newtonian dynamics , @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "then with eq .",
    "11 we find two expressions for the core radius : newtonian , @xmath60}^{-2 }   { t_{kev}}^{-{1\\over 4 } } { \\rm mpc}\\eqno(15)\\ ] ] and mond , @xmath61}^{-{4\\over 3 } }   { t_{kev}}^{1\\over 6}{\\rm mpc}. \\eqno(16)\\ ] ] these two values are equal when @xmath62}^{-{8\\over 5}}. \\eqno(17)\\ ] ] this meaning of the final expression is that when the temperature is less than about 3 kev ( for @xmath63 ev ) the cluster core is in the mond regime and eq .",
    "16 applies ; for higher temperatures the cluster core is the newtonian regime with core radius given by eq .",
    "15 . in either case",
    ", this characteristic radius is on the order of 800 kpc and depends very weakly on temperature in both regimes .    now assuming that baryons are mixed into this cluster with the cosmic ratio , most of the x - ray emission would be coming from the core region .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is @xmath64 or @xmath65 for cooler clusters ( mond regime ) and @xmath66 for warmer clusters ( newtonian regime ) . in this way ,",
    "the steeper than expected luminosity - temperature relation can be understood in terms of the mixed neutrino - baryon fluid .",
    "the transition from newton to mond would explain the steepening of the correlation for lower temperature clusters .",
    "this , of course , is only approximate .",
    "x - ray emission also originates beyond the core , and the gas is not isothermal . in the next section",
    "i derive detailed two fluid models of clusters .",
    "the contribution of neutrinos to the mass budget of clusters has been considered previously in the context of mixed cdm - hdm models @xcite . in the process of collapse and virialization of a multi - fluid mixture of neutrinos and baryons ( and/or cdm ) , violent relaxation @xcite is expected to produce equal velocity dispersions for the various components , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "i assume this condition here , although it may not be strictly true ; for example , violent relaxation may be incomplete in the outer regions of clusters .",
    "moreover , recent observations have demonstrated that the hot gas in clusters is not isothermal , in general .",
    "the implications for the hypothetical neutrino fluid are unclear , but i will assume an isothermal condition with the neutrino velocity dispersion equal the emission - weighted velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that the density given by eq .",
    "11 is an upper limit to the density of the neutrino fluid ; this value follows from the limit imposed by initial phase space density via the collision - less boltzmann equation @xcite ; the course grained phase space density in a final relaxed virialized system , and hence the space density , may be less significantly less than this value .",
    "moreover , while the neutrino fluid may be partially degenerate in the core , it will certainly depart from degeneracy in the outer regions where the space density declines and the velocity dispersion remains constant .",
    "therefore , with respect to the neutrino fluid , we need to consider the equation of state of partially degenerate matter .    with these caveats in mind ,",
    "i calculate the structure of the neutrino - baryon fluid by applying the hydrostatic gas equation separately to each fluid : @xmath68 where the subscript @xmath69 refers to one of the two fluid components , @xmath70 is the pressure of that component , @xmath71 is the density , and @xmath72 is the total gravitational acceleration resulting from the two components and given by the simple mond expression , @xmath73 with @xmath74 given by eq",
    ".  7 and the @xmath75 , the newtonian force , given by @xmath76    the pressure of the baryonic component is @xmath77 the velocity dispersion for the baryons @xmath78 ( the temperature ) may be specified as a constant ( isothermal ) or may vary with radius if the density distribution is specified .",
    "the equation of state for a partially degenerate neutrino gas is given parametrically by @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath72 is the statistical weight , @xmath81 , and @xmath82^{-1 } dx } \\eqno(23)\\ ] ] ( see e.g. landau & lifshitz 1980 ) . here",
    "the degeneracy factor @xmath83 is the chemical potential divided by the temperature ; large positive values of @xmath83 would correspond to complete degeneracy ( @xmath84 ) and large negative values , to complete non - degeneracy ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the density and the velocity dispersion formally determine the chemical potential , but there is no independent method , short of numerical calculations of collapse of the two- fluid mixture to estimate @xmath83 .",
    "this essentially depends upon how close the actual central density of the neutrino fluid is to the maximum permitted by the phase space constraints and the effectiveness of violent relaxation in equalising the velocity dispersions of the two fluids .",
    "there are various arguments suggesting that the true density should range between 10% and 100% @xmath86 @xcite ; here i take @xmath87 because this is in rough agreement with the observational results shown in fig .  2 ( i.e. , the central neutrino density is 50% that corresponding to quantum mechanical degeneracy ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath88 , and in the calculations described below , i have fixed the central value of @xmath83 at this value . realistically ,",
    "due to random initial conditions for cluster formation , one would expect a dispersion in this parameter .    assuming a comparable mass ( @xmath89 ev ) for all three neutrino types , a constant temperature for both fluids ( with the velocity dispersion of neutrinos equal to that of the baryons ) , and a mass ratio of the two components equal to the cosmic density ratio ( 2.68 in this case ) , the structure of the object may be determined by numerical integration of eqs .",
    "18 supplemented by eqs .",
    "19 - 23 . with these assumptions and constraints ,",
    "the structure completely determined when the gas temperature is specified .",
    "3 shows the density distribution for the two fluids in the case where @xmath90 .",
    "the density of the two components effectively track each other in the inner regions .",
    "the distributions can be described as a roughly constant density core extending to about 300 kpc , followed by a rapid decrease ( asymptotically @xmath91 for both components .",
    "the x - ray luminosity resulting from free - free emission of the hot ionised gas may also be calculated for any such object .",
    "the resulting luminosity - temperature relation is shown in fig .  4 compared to the sample of ikebe et al .",
    "this is similar to the figure shown in sanders ( 2003 ) but there the dark component was added arbitrarily , with no underlying physics . here",
    "the x - ray emission is that from self - consistent neutrino - baryon fluid spheres with only the neutrino mass and degeneracy factor specified arbitrarily .",
    "the results generally agree with the observed relation ; in particular the steepening of the relation for low temperature clusters is evident .",
    "the gas density distribution in real clusters does not resemble that shown in fig .",
    "the density in these isothermal models falls too rapidly beyond the core to be consistent with the observed distribution of x - ray surface brightness in clusters ; i.e. , the power law implied by the fitted @xmath1 models ( eq .  6 ) is more like @xmath92 rather than @xmath93 .",
    "however , it is now known that the gas in clusters can not be described as isothermal .",
    "there appears to be a characteristic temperature profile in clusters : in non - cooling flow clusters the temperature declines by 20 or 30% between 100 kpc and 1 mpc ; in cooling flow clusters there is first a rapid rise in the inner core region ( by as much as a factor of two ) followed by the decline observed in non - cooling flow clusters @xcite    therefore , here i take a different approach .",
    "i assume the density distribution of the gas is given by a @xmath1 model and i solve eq .",
    "19 to determine the temperature distribution for the gas .",
    "the neutrino fluid is again assumed to be isothermal with a velocity dispersion equal to that implied by mean emission weighted temperature of the gas . in this way",
    ", one may predict the temperature distribution in a particular cluster with a fitted @xmath1 model .",
    "the only adjustable parameter is the central value of the gas temperature , and this is chosen to match either the mean emission - weighted temperature of the gas or to achieve the best fit to the projected gas temperature as a function of radius .",
    "in fact , there is generally a narrow range of this parameter which yields a reasonable temperature distribution for the cluster one which does not increase rapidly to absurdly high values or one which does not fall rapidly to zero .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "5 which is the radial dependence of projected gas temperature for the model fit to a2256 with @xmath94 ev and @xmath88 .",
    "this is a non - cooling flow cluster with a low central density ( @xmath95 @xmath96 ) and a large core radius ( @xmath97 kpc ) .",
    "the decline of surface brightness implies @xmath98 @xcite . taking a central gas temperature of 7.5 kev produces a projected temperature profile ( solid curve ) which is consistent with that observed @xcite .",
    "the dashed curves illustrate the effect of taking a central gas temperature one - half kev higher or lower ; it is evident that the resulting temperature profile is strongly dependent upon the initial assumed central gas temperature .",
    "this procedure has been carried out for several non - cooling flow clusters , and the characteristic temperature profile is as shown here ; i.e. , it is consistent with the observed profiles for non - cooling flow clusters .    for cooling flow clusters , the results are even more sensitively dependent upon the assumed central temperature , but , in general",
    ", the calculated temperature profiles agree with those observed for cooling flow clusters .",
    "this is shown in fig .  6 which illustrates the predicted temperature profile ( again with @xmath54 ev and @xmath99 ) for the cooling flow cluster a85 with @xmath1 model parameters of @xmath100 , @xmath101 kpc ,",
    "@xmath102 @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "this is compared to the observed temperature profile by de grandi & molendi .",
    "the dotted curves show the effect of increasing or decreasing the assumed central gas temperature by 0.1 kev ; i.e. , the results here are extremely dependent upon the this parameter",
    ".    for clusters with @xmath1 model fits characterised by a small core radius and high central electron density , this is the general pattern predicted the two fluid models : a rapid rise in temperature followed by a gradual decline . in general",
    ", the predicted central temperature is lower than observed and the detailed agreement is less impressive than for non - cooling flow clusters .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that no baryonic component other than the gas is included in these calculations ; the galaxies , and in particular , large central cd galaxies are not part of the mass modelling .",
    "overall , it appears that when the @xmath1 model is imposed upon the gas density distribution , the temperature distribution required by self - consistency is in general agreement with the observed temperature profiles .",
    "it would seem possible that individual galaxies could possess extensive neutrino dark halos , even if the neutrino mass is as low as 2 ev .",
    "it is true that no primordial fluctuations on the scale of galaxies would survive in the cosmic neutrino fluid due to free streaming .",
    "however , in the context of mond , the baryonic component would collapse first and act as a seed for subsequent neutrino infall .",
    "the neutrino halo could have a mass almost three times larger than the baryonic galaxy , but because of the phase space constraint , it would be very extensive . rewriting eq .  16 in terms of rotation velocity , @xmath104 , we would find , @xmath105}^{-{4\\over 3 } }   \\bigl[{{v_r}\\over { 200\\,{\\rm km / s}}}\\bigr]^{1\\over 3 }   { \\rm mpc}\\eqno(24)\\ ] ] for @xmath56 ev the halo would extend to 500 kpc for a typical massive galaxy .",
    "the total mass of the neutrino halo on galactic scale ( 10 - 20 kpc ) would be less than 1% of the galaxy s baryonic mass and the contribution of the halo to the observed rotation curve in the outer regions would be less than 10 km / s .",
    "therefore , such a halo could have no effect on observed galaxy kinematics .",
    "it would , however , affect the weak lensing properties of galaxies on large scale . on the scale of hundreds of kpc , the halo mass would exceed the mass of the galaxy , and dominate the lensing signal . if , for example , the halo were flattened , then , with sufficient statistics , this could be apparent from the pattern of background galaxy images @xcite .",
    "non - baryonic dark matter in the form of active neutrinos certainly exists ; only its contribution to the total mean cosmic density is in question .",
    "if the mass of the three neutrino types is as large as 2 ev , then neutrinos will be a constituent of massive rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "for this mass scale , the cosmological density ratio is of the order of the remaining mass discrepancy in clusters calculated via mond ; i.e. , such neutrinos would complete the mass budget of clusters in the context of mond . maintaining",
    "the cosmological mass ratio in clusters leads naturally to a dependence of central electron density on temperature ( @xmath106) a dependence which is consistent with density inferred from @xmath1 model fits to the x - ray intensity distribution in non - cooling flow clusters ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this gas density - temperature dependence corresponds precisely to the constant entropy floor that has been proposed to account for the steepness of the observed luminosity - temperature relation , but in this case no preheating of the cosmic baryon fluid is needed ; the floor is provided by the phase space constraints on neutrino density .",
    "of course , in cooling flow clusters one would expect there to be an inward flow of gas and breaking of the cosmological density ratio with resulting higher electron densities .",
    "assuming that the cosmic density ratio of the two fluids is maintained and that the neutrinos and baryons have the same velocity dispersion , then only the neutrino mass and the degeneracy factor need be specified in order to calculate hydrostatic two fluid models of clusters .",
    "such models , with @xmath48 ev exhibit the observed x - ray luminosity - temperature relation including a break to a steeper relation for lower temperature clusters ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "if the gas density distribution is constrained to follow the fitted @xmath1 models for clusters , then the temperature distribution of the gas required for self - consistency resembles that in actual clusters a general decline over hundreds of kpc for non - cooling clusters , but a rapid rise followed by a decline for cooling flow clusters ( figs .",
    "5 & 6 ) .",
    "thus these calculations support the suggestion that the missing component in clusters of galaxies , in the context of mond , may be neutrinos with mass near the present experimental upper limit .",
    "a remaining observational problem with this is that some clusters primarily cooling flow clusters apparently require a higher central density of dark material than is permitted by the phase space constraints on neutrinos @xcite .",
    "this is evident both from x - ray observations and observations of strong gravitational lensing in the centres of some clusters where the implied central mass within an einstein ring radius ( 100 - 200 kpc ) may be in excess of @xmath107 m@xmath108 @xcite .",
    "of course , the presence of a massive central galaxy and its effect on the distribution of neutrinos has not been included here , but it may well be that an additional undetected baryonic component in cooling flow clusters perhaps resulting from the cooling flow itself is required .",
    "i have also not considered the possibility that there is at least one massive sterile neutrino a possibility with some theoretical and experimental motivation @xcite . in any case",
    ", the greatest part of the discrepancy in clusters would be accounted for by the three types of active neutrinos if their mass is near 2 ev .",
    "we will not have to wait long for this possibility to be falsified ( or confirmed ) .",
    "currently planned @xmath1 decay experiments @xcite will push the upper limit on the electron neutrino mass to a few tenths of an electron volt within a few years .",
    "if it turns out to be the case that @xmath48 ev , then , with mond , the old problem of clusters is solved .",
    "i am grateful to moti milgrom for helpful comments on the manuscript and to nasser mohamed ahmed for useful discussions on cooling flow clusters and relevant numerical calculations .",
