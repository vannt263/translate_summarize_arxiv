    "the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; * ? ? ? * ) on board the _ swift _ @xcite observatory , provides rapid follow - up observations of grb afterglows at uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "typical times from a _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) grb trigger to first uvot observation range from 40 to 200 seconds .",
    "the uvot usually provides the first optical , and almost always the only uv observations , of grb afterglows . for detected grb afterglows",
    ", the uvot provides rapidly available sub - arcsecond locations , as well as high time resolution light curves in up to seven broad photometric bands .",
    "the relatively deep uvot detection limits at early times also place constraints on the `` dark burst '' phenomenon ( cf .",
    "in addition , the uvot observations are made simultaneously with x - ray observations with the coaligned _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ; * ? ? ? * ) , allowing direct comparison of burst properties in x - ray and uv / optical light .",
    "this paper describes the first _ swift _ uvot grb afterglow catalog , containing information on bursts observed during the first 2.5 years of uvot operation ( 2005 - 2007 ; corresponding to the instrument turn - on until the end of the 1st bat grb catalog @xcite ) .",
    "the catalog includes 205 bursts first detected by the _ swift _ bat , and 24 bursts first detected by other satellites or networks : the _ high energy transient explorer  2 _ ( hete2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( integral ) , and the interplanetary network ( ipn ; * ? ? ?",
    "information is provided for over @xmath0 individual images of grb fields taken by the uvot .    in section 2 ,",
    "we present the observations made by the uvot . in section 3",
    ", we describe the construction of the databases and the catalog . in section 4 , we describe the format of the databases and catalog . in section 5 ,",
    "we provide a summary of the catalog . in section 6 we summarize future work to be accomplished .",
    "the databases and catalog are provided in electronic format with this paper and are also available at the _ swift _ website .",
    "the uvot utilizes seven broadband filters during the observation of grbs .",
    "the characteristics of the filters  central wavelength ( @xmath11 ) , fwhm , zero points ( the magnitudes at which the detector registers @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ) , and the flux conversion factors ( @xmath14 )  can be found in table  [ tab5 ] @xcite .",
    "the flux density conversion factors are calculated based on model grb power law spectra with a redshift ranging from @xmath15 @xcite . the nominal image scale for uvot images is @xmath16 ( unbinned ) .",
    "uvot data is collected in one of two modes : event ( or photon counting ) and image .",
    "event mode captures the time of the arriving photon as well as the celestial coordinates .",
    "the temporal resolution in this mode is @xmath17 . in image mode ,",
    "photons are counted during the exposure and the position is recorded , but no timing information is stored except for the start and stop times of the exposure . because the spacecraft has limited data storage capabilities , most uvot observations are performed in image mode since the telemetry rate is significantly lower than event mode observations .    since the launch of _ swift _ , the automated observing sequence of the uvot has been changed a few times in order to optimize observations of grbs .",
    "the automated sequence is a set of variables which includes , but is not limited to , the filters , modes , and exposure times .",
    "the basic automated sequence design consists of finding charts and a series of short , medium , and long exposures in various filters .",
    "the finding charts are typically taken in both event and image mode simultaneously , in both the @xmath4 and @xmath7 filters , and have exposure times ranging from @xmath18 .",
    "a subset of these finding charts are immediately telemetered to ground - based telescopes to aid in localizing the grb filter are taken in image mode only . ] .",
    "after completion of the @xmath4 and @xmath7 finding charts , a series of short exposures is typically taken in event mode , in all seven broadband filters , and has exposure times ranging from @xmath19 .",
    "a series of medium exposures is then taken in image mode , in all seven broadband filters , and has exposure times ranging from @xmath20 . finally , a series of long exposures is taken in image mode , in all seven broadband filters , and has typical exposure times of @xmath21 . in all cases ,",
    "exposures can be cut short due to observing constraints .",
    "this catalog covers uvot observations of 229 grb afterglows from 2005 jan 17 to 2007 jun 16 .",
    "it includes bursts detected by _ swift _",
    "bat , hete2 , integral , ipn and observed by uvot .",
    "a total of 211 bat - detected bursts were observed by the uvot ( after instrument turn on ) representing 93% of the bat sample .",
    "those that were not observed by the uvot were either too close in angular distance to a bright ( @xmath22 ) source , or occurred during uvot engineering observations .",
    "not included in the catalog are nine bursts first detected by bat and integral and observed by uvot but with no afterglow position reported by the xrt or ground based observers ( see table  [ tab6 ] ) .",
    "inspection of the uvot images reveals no obvious afterglows for these bursts .",
    "hereafter , we adopt the notation @xmath23 for the afterglow flux density as a function of time , where @xmath24 is the frequency of the observed flux density , @xmath25 is the time post trigger , @xmath26 is the spectral index which is related to the photon index @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , and @xmath5 is the temporal decay slope .",
    "to provide a baseline for understanding the work described below , we define three words in the context of this catalog : database , catalog , and photometry pipeline .",
    "the database is the repository for all uvot grb data processed by the photometry pipeline .",
    "the catalog is the compilation of the top - level data from the uvot database , as well as other sources ( i.e. the bat catalog @xcite , the gamma - ray burst coordinate network ( gcn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) circulars , etc . ) that provides the primary characteristics of each burst .",
    "the photometry pipeline is the script that combines the required ftools ( with uvotsource performing the photometry ) to produce the database and catalog .",
    "below we describe the construction of the image and event databases , the catalog , and the requisite quality checks .",
    "the uvot grb photometric image database is a collection of raw photometric measurements of uvot images .",
    "the first step in constructing the database was to build an archive of uvot grb images . to ensure that all of our images and exposure maps benefitted from consistent and up - to - date calibrations and processing , the _ swift _ data center reprocessed the entire uvot grb image archive .",
    "for example , images taken early in the mission did not benefit from mod-8 pattern noise correction .",
    "all reprocessed images are now mod-8 corrected .",
    "a number of images in our archive did not have a fine aspect correction applied ; many of these images were recovered by running uvotskycorr .",
    "lastly , we corrected a number of images which had improper object keywords .",
    "we developed an idl based image processing pipeline to perform aperture photometry on our archive of re - processed sky images .",
    "figure  [ fig - flowchart ] is a diagram of the uvot uvotphot photometric pipeline software ( version 1.0 ) .",
    "the heart of uvotphot is the _ swift _ uvot tool uvotsource .",
    "the pipeline used headas version 6.4 and the 2007 november uvot caldb .",
    "photometry was performed on individual sky images using the curves of growth from the _ swift _ caldb for the aperture correction model .",
    "upper limits were reported for sources @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ fig - flowchart ] shows the additional inputs to the uvotphot pipeline software .",
    "the grb information file contains the best reported source position and error estimate for each burst . in a small number of cases , we refined the positions to better center bursts in our source apertures .",
    "references for the best reported burst positions can be found in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "source region files specify a simple circular inclusion region of a given aperture size .",
    "aperture photometry using a @xmath30 radius aperture was performed for version 1.0 of the database . since a @xmath31 radius aperture ( containing @xmath32 of the psf )",
    "was used for calibrating the uvot , an aperture correction is applied to the data @xcite .",
    "background regions contain inclusion regions for background estimation and exclusion regions to mask out sources and/or features in each field . in most cases",
    "we use a standard annular inclusion region of inner and outer radii of @xmath33 and @xmath34 around each burst . to decrease the number of background region files required by our pipeline , we constructed composite region files to mask out sources and features in all bands . a small number of fields required non - standard region files",
    ". the background is calculated by taking the average background of all the pixels in the net background region .",
    "the region files ( and postage stamp images ) used in our processing can be found at the _ swift _ website .",
    "sources within @xmath35 of each burst , which may contaminate photometry in our source apertures , are listed in the uvotsourcetable.fits product . for each source",
    "we record its position and the measured magnitude in each filter .",
    "source contamination is evidenced as a non - zero offset in the light curve data products .",
    "uvot images which suffer from other sources of contamination or degradation ( not including nearby sources ) have been identified .",
    "image quality information is recorded as a series of  flags \" which correspond to 1 ) bursts embedded in a large halo structure from nearby bright stars , 2 ) images where the burst was near the edge of the fov , 3 ) images with charge trails in the source aperture , 4 ) images with diffraction spikes in the source aperture , 5 ) images which do not have fine aspect corrections , and 6 ) bursts embedded in crowded fields .",

    ". images considered to be of low quality and have at least one quality flag raised also have the quality flag set to true (  t \" ) .    for images that were generated from both image and event mode simultaneously (",
    "usually the finding charts are taken in this dual mode ) , the event mode data are excluded from the image database . a description of the event mode data can be found in section 3.2 below .      for each grb , the first orbit @xmath7 and @xmath4 event lists were obtained from the the swift data center . like the sky images",
    ", the event lists benefited from reprocessing using uvot(20071106 ) and mis(20080326 ) calibration and processing pipeline .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath4 are the only filters for which event lists have been included in the catalog because these filters are used for the finding chart exposures , which are expected to show variability on the shortest timescales .",
    "the event processing pipeline is based on perl and implements the _ swift _ software and calibration found in the headas 6.3.2 release .",
    "the pipeline refines the aspect of the event lists and then extracts the photometry . during the slew , immediately after the bat trigger , the star tracker reports step - like changes in position to the attitude file .",
    "the first stage of the pipeline corrects the positions in the attitude file using attjumpcorr and then recomputes the positions of every photon in the event list using the corrected attitude file and the ftool coordinator .",
    "the pipeline then refines the aspect of the event list by creating images every @xmath36 and applying aspect correction software to each image .",
    "the aspect correction software locates the stars in each image and compares their positions to those in the usno - b1 catalogue , correcting for proper motions . for each image",
    ", it computes the ra and dec offset between the stars in the image and those in the usno - b1 catalogue .",
    "the offset is converted into pixels and then is applied to the position of each photon in the event list during the time interval of the image . to extract the photometry the pipeline runs uvotevtlc on the aspect corrected event lists using @xmath36 uniform binning , the @xmath37 source regions and the background regions used to extract the image photometry .",
    "the event lists , like the images , can suffer from a number of sources of contamination or degradation .",
    "these sources have been identified and flagged in a similar fashion as the uvot images .",
    "the uvot grb catalog was constructed by combining information from various sources .",
    "burst positions , trigger time , and time to the first uvot observation were extracted from the image database .",
    "the magnitude of the first and peak detections were also determined for each filter .",
    "a value of ",
    "-99 \" indicates that no uvot data was available , while a value of  99 \" indicates a @xmath38 detection .",
    "additional information in the catalog was gleaned from the literature . a reference to the best reported burst position",
    "is provided .",
    "also included is a flag indicating which observatory discovered each burst .",
    "galactic absorption and hi column density along the line of sight , @xmath39 , redshift , grb fluence in the @xmath40 band , radio flux , and a flag to indicate detections in ground - based @xmath41 bands are provided for each burst .",
    "temporal slopes are derived for bursts with a sufficient number of significant detections , from which magnitudes are computed at @xmath9 ( see section 5 ) .      to verify the quality of the data ,",
    "the following checks were performed : photometric and astrometric stability of field stars , light curve production and investigation of previously detected and non - detected afterglows , comparison of photometry to previously published results , and visual examination of flagged images .",
    "a description of each quality check is found below .",
    "the stability of photometric and astrometric measurements made by the pipeline were tested by applying the pipeline to stars , located in the uvot grb fields , which have reliable astrometric and photometric measurements from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) database . from this database 108",
    "test stars in 32 grb fields were selected which were : within @xmath42 of the grb location , have magnitudes such that the stars are detectable in the uvot images , and are detected at the @xmath2-level . since we can not select where grbs are located , the field stars were not selected to be standard stars .",
    "however , obvious variable stars were rejected from the sample .",
    "astrometric and photometric measurements were made of these stars in every uvot image that covers their locations .",
    "statistical characterization of the distributions of positions and count rates of the stars was done in order to quantitatively describe both the internal and absolute accuracy and precision of the pipeline measurements .",
    "the mean position offsets in each band , relative to the usno - b1 positions , defines the absolute accuracy of the astrometry .",
    "the usno - b1 positions are used because the usno - b1 catalog covers the entire sky and all uvot positions are determined from this catalog between the sdss and usno - b1 positions _ after _ correcting for proper motions . ] .",
    "the peak of the angular offset is @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath43 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath45 , and @xmath47 for the uvw2 , uvm2 , uvw1 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath7 , and @xmath4 filters , respectively ( cf . figure  [ fig - astrometric ] ) . to determine the internal precision of the astrometry ,",
    "we have calculated the rayleigh scale parameter for the distributions of angular offsets from the mean stellar positions .",
    "a rayleigh distribution holds if the offsets in ra and dec are independent and normally distributed with the same standard deviation , which is then equivalent to the rayleigh scale parameter .",
    "the internal astrometric precision ( given by the rayleigh scale parameter ) of each of the uvot bands is @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath46 , @xmath53 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for the uvw2 , uvm2 , uvw1 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath7 , and @xmath4 bands respectively .",
    "the mean count rates of the stars , converted to magnitudes on the johnson system , is compared with the sdss magnitudes transformed to the johnson system , to define the absolute accuracy of the photometry .",
    "the conversions from sdss and uvot magnitudes to the johnson system are based on work by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the average absolute photometric offset between the sdss and uvot ( @xmath55 ) is @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) magnitudes ( @xmath2 confidence limit ) for the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath7 filters , respectively ( cf . figure  [ fig - color ] ) .",
    "the standard deviation of the mean count rates defines the internal precision of the photometry .",
    "the average standard deviation about the mean , over the nominal magnitude range of @xmath62 is 0.11 , 0.13 , and 0.09 mag for the uvw2 , uvm2 , and uvw1 filters , respectively , and over the nominal magnitude range of @xmath63 is 0.06 , 0.05 , 0.06 , and 0.05 mag for the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath7 , and @xmath4 filters , respectively ( cf . figure  [ fig - photometric ] ) .",
    "we also compared the catalog entries to published values . in a small number of cases ,",
    "no sources were detected in the database whereas the literature provides light curves for faint detections .",
    "this is because the photometry database is constructed with individual , not co - added , images .",
    "the uvot burst database results were also compared against the following published results in order to perform a consistency check for the following detected burst afterglows : grbs 060218 @xcite , 050525a @xcite , 060313 @xcite , 061007 @xcite , 050319 @xcite , 050318 @xcite , 050603 @xcite , 051117a @xcite , 050801 @xcite , 050730 @xcite , and 050802 @xcite .",
    "the comparison resulted in all the catalog data being consistent with the published data .",
    "images will still be in the uvot catalog even if certain quality checks are not passed .",
    "some of the bad aspect correction flags were determined by keywords in the image files themselves , while others were flagged by the uvotphot photometry pipeline .",
    "below is a description of the checks performed on all flagged images .",
    "_ settling _ : when the spacecraft reaches the target location , it requires a brief period of time to lock onto the target ; this period is known as settling . during this time",
    "the uvot is observing in event mode , typically in the @xmath7-filter .",
    "because the uvot detector voltage is changing during this period , the count rate is not calibrated ; therefore , these images are flagged as settling exposures and should be used with caution .",
    "the criteria for flagging an image as a settling exposure is if the image is : the first in the first observation sequence , taken in event mode , taken in the @xmath7-filter , and the exposure time is @xmath64 .    each grb observation for which the first finding chart exposure is present should include a settling exposure just prior to the start of the observation .",
    "this condition was checked in the database file , and cases where no settling image was flagged were investigated ; this ensures that all settling images are flagged as such . to ensure that non - settling images have not been erroneously flagged , any settling mode images that were found to occur _",

    "the best fit parameters were determined by minimizing the @xmath147 value of the fit to the coincidence loss corrected linear count rates and their errors .",
    "the values of the fit parameters are given in the _ swift _ uvot burst catalog .",
    "light curves and fits are shown in figure9 , for the well - sampled bursts in the bands for which there is the largest number of detections of a given burst afterglow . in the case of grb060218 ,",
    "a power - law is not a satisfactory description of the light curve , so its light curve is shown without a fit .",
    "figure  [ fig-061021 ] shows the light curves in all seven uvot filters for grb061007 .",
    "the lower right panel of figure  [ fig-061021 ] shows all of the light curves for grb061007 scaled to match the @xmath7 band light curve fit at @xmath134 .",
    "we note that the light curves have been plotted on a log - linear scale as opposed to the traditional log - log scale .",
    "this is done for diagnostic reasons in order to examine if the light curves approach zero .",
    "if the light curve approaches zero then there is no host galaxy contributing to the overall results .",
    "if the light curve is above zero then there is host galaxy contribution .",
    "if the light curve was below zero then a problem was identified and fixed .",
    "up to this point , we have only illustrated light curves on the basis of the image database .",
    "figure  [ fig - event ] demonstrates the light curve for grb 060607a as generated from a version of the event database .",
    "the event database provides the capability to probe the very early development of the afterglow .",
    "a discussion of the early afterglow features is presented elsewhere @xcite .    from the light",
    "curves a study of the interrelationship between bursts can be made .",
    "the majority of the well - sampled light curves are fit by a single power - law after several hundred seconds .",
    "figure  [ fig - alpha ] illustrates the distribution of temporal slopes across all filters and bursts while figure  [ fig - alphafilters ] shows the distribution of temporal slopes as a function of filter .",
    "the temporal slope ranges from @xmath148 to @xmath149 .",
    "the average temporal slope for the entire sample is @xmath150 ( the dispersion about the mean , @xmath151 ) which is consistent with other published results @xcite . for the individual filters the average @xmath5 is 1.30 @xmath152 , 1.31 @xmath153 , 0.96 @xmath154 , 0.86 @xmath155 , 1.05 @xmath156 , 1.00 @xmath157 , and 0.83 @xmath158 for the uvw2 , uvm2 , uvw1 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath7 , and @xmath4 filters , respectively .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test between the uv and optical data sets ( excluding the @xmath4 filter ) indicates that the probability of the two data sets being different is 0.087 .    by using the temporal slopes ,",
    "we have calculated the magnitude of the light curves at @xmath9 in each available uvot band .",
    "the average @xmath7-band magnitude at @xmath9 is 18.02 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - colors ] reveals the color - color relationship between the uvw1 , @xmath49 , and @xmath7 colors .",
    "typical values for @xmath160 are @xmath161 with a small amount of scatter . on the other hand , values for @xmath162 are @xmath163 with a large degree of scatter .",
    "figures  [ fig14 ]  &  [ fig15 ] provide a comparison of the x - ray flux at @xmath10 ( @xmath164 ) in the @xmath165 band , and the prompt @xmath166-ray fluence ( @xmath167 ) in the @xmath40 band to the optical flux at @xmath9 ( @xmath168)-ray fluences are found in @xcite . ] .",
    "evident from the figures is a general trend of x - ray flux or @xmath166-ray fluence to correspond to optical brightness . using the spearman rank correlation , the data are strongly correlated ( @xmath169 ) and marginally correlated ( @xmath170 ) for @xmath164 and @xmath167 , respectively .",
    "an x - ray - to - optical correlation has been suggested previously @xcite .",
    "we note that none of these values have been corrected for redshift .",
    "this is outside the scope of this paper and left for future work .",
    "we also provide the redshift distribution of the burst sample ( see figure  [ fig - z ] ) .",
    "the redshifts were not determined by the uvot but rather by spectroscopic measurements with ground based instruments . from the distribution",
    "it can be seen that the uvot is sampling bursts across the entire redshift range up to the uvot redshift limit of @xmath171 .",
    "this catalog is useful for examining the relationship between optically detected and undetected bursts .",
    "future versions of the database will incorporate various enhancements to the current version .",
    "some of these enhancements include : using filter dependent region files , more fully automating quality checks , adding functionality to the ftools uvotsource , and optimal coaddition of images .    for the current version of the database ,",
    "composite region files were used .",
    "future versions would use filter dependent ( non - composite ) region files for each burst .",
    "there are several cases where a dense population of sources in the @xmath7 filter make for a complicated background region file , while the field is not at all complicated in the uv filters .",
    "a better background estimate can be determined if separate region files were used .",
    "future databases may be able to reclaim some exposures flagged as  poor quality \" images .",
    "our method for finding images contaminated by charge trails or diffraction spikes is to sum all images in a given filter and observation sequence , visually inspect them , and manually flag contaminated images .",
    "this works well for small apertures , but future databases will require photometry for each object in a wide range of apertures , which would potentially require a different set of quality files for each aperture size . a better way to handle this problem would be to identify bright stars in each field and determine whether the spacecraft roll angle would align any of them in the ccd readout direction so as to affect a given aperture at the grb location . this eliminates the need for manual checking of a large number of images . by automating the process only the individual images that are contaminated",
    "would be flagged , as opposed to flagging entire observation sequences of images .",
    "future databases would also check the photometric stability using field stars for each image .",
    "several improvements to the uvot tools used in generating the database have been proposed .",
    "currently , uvotsource is not capable of performing sigma clipping of background pixels . adding this functionality would improve the background computations .",
    "since uvotsource uses a gaussian model of the background , it has difficulty in estimating images with extremely low background counts as we often see in uv images . adding a poisson or binomial background model would greatly improve our results in some cases .    in this database version ,",
    "no coaddition of the individual images was attempted .",
    "future work will include optimal coaddition of the data using the method proposed by @xcite . using",
    "this method will identify more detections from this and future databases .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the contributions from members of the _ swift _ team at the pennsylvania state university ( psu ) , university college london / mullard space science laboratory ( mssl ) , nasa / goddard space flight center , and our subcontractors , who helped make this instrument possible .",

    "<S> positions for bursts detected at the @xmath2-level are provided with a nominal accuracy , relative to the usno - b1 catalog , of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> photometry for each burst is given in three uv bands , three optical bands , and a ` @xmath4 ' or open filter . </S>",
    "<S> upper limits for magnitudes are reported for sources detected below @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> general properties of the burst sample and light curves , including the filter - dependent temporal slopes , are also provided . the majority of the uvot light curves , for bursts detected at the @xmath2-level , </S>",
    "<S> can be fit by a single power - law , with a median temporal slope ( @xmath5 ) of 0.96 , beginning several hundred seconds after the burst trigger and ending at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the median uvot @xmath7-band ( @xmath8 ) magnitude at @xmath9 for a sample of  well \" detected bursts is 18.02 . </S>",
    "<S> the uvot flux interpolated to @xmath9 after the burst , shows relatively strong correlations with both the prompt _ swift _ bat fluence , and the _ swift _ x - ray flux at @xmath10 after the trigger . </S>"
