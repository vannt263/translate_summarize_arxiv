    "however , we are still far from resolving the puzzle of grbs , since many crucial information concerning the true nature of the inner engine is lost after an initial acceleration phase of the fireball evolution .",
    "studies on afterglows can hopefully provide important clues of grb progenitors .",
    "for example , from afterglow observations , we can measure the beaming angle , the environment density , the total kinetic energy etc ( hjorth et al . 2002 ; knigl & granot 2002 ) .",
    "for recent reviews on grbs , see piran ( 1999 ) , van paradijs , kouveliotou & wijers ( 2000 ) and mszros ( 2002 ) .    as the most violent bursts in the universe since the big bang , grbs are most impressing for their extremely relativistic motions , with lorentz factor @xmath0 100  1000 . in 1997 , wijers et al .",

    ", we assume that the magnetic energy density in the comoving frame is a fraction @xmath9 of the total thermal energy density ( @xmath10 ) .",

    "the bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath3 ) will be so close to unity that @xmath23 will also be very close to one .",

    "but there are still many relativistic electrons with lorentz factor above a critical value , @xmath29 , and still capable of emitting synchrotron radiation . in this case , to calculate the optical afterglow , we just need to integrate the emission over all those electrons satisfying @xmath30 .",
    "the determination of @xmath29 is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we believe that it could be some value like 5 or 10 .",

    "have been detected for more than six months , and radio afterglows are even detectable one or three years later ( frail et al . 2000 ; kulkarni 2002 ) , we see that the study of afterglows in the deep newtonian phase is really essential .    in our calculations , we have assumed that the minimum lorentz factor of electrons capable of emitting synchrotron radiation is @xmath64 .",
    "this evaluation is somewhat arbitrary , but it does not affect the optical light curve too much . the characteristic synchrotron frequency of an electron with lorentz factor @xmath65 in a magnetic field @xmath66 is @xmath67 hz .",
    "electrons in the lower energy range thus do not contribute to optical flux density significantly .",
    "in fact , we have taken @xmath29 as 10 or even 50 in our trial calculations and just found no difference in the optical light curves .",
    "collimation is very important in grbs , which can affect the intrinsic kinetic energy and may provide direct clues on the progenitors ( frail et al .",

    "beaming effects in afterglows have been discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "it is generally believed that due to both the edge effect ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ; mszros & rees 1999 ; panaitescu & mszros 1999 ) and the lateral expansion effect ( rhoads 1997 , 1999 ) , afterglows from a conical jet are characterized by a break in the light curve .",
    "the break point is approximately determined by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the initial half opening angle .",
    "grbs 990123 , 990510 and 000301c are regarded as good examples ( castro - tirado et al .",

    "however , detailed numerical studies show that the break is usually quite smooth ( moderski , sikora & bulik 2000 ) .",
    "huang et al . further found that the break is parameter - dependent ( huang et al .",
    "2000a , b ) .",
    "they also suggested that the trans - relativistic and non - relativistic stages are important and should be considered carefully . in this section",

    "( 2000a , b ) .      fig .",
    "2 illustrates the evolution and afterglows of some exemplary conical jets without lateral expansion .",
    "in fact , the dynamical evolution of such a jet should be very similar to that of an isotropic fireball , i.e. , @xmath56 in the ultra - relativistic phase and @xmath70 in the newtonian stage .",
    "2a shows these trends exactly . as for the optical light curve ,",
    "analytical solutions predict that it should follow @xmath71 ( @xmath72 for @xmath49 ) before @xmath73 .",
    "but soon after the @xmath74 point , a break should appear and the light curve becomes @xmath75 ( @xmath76 for @xmath25 ) .",
    "this relation can be derived as follows .",
    "analytically we have @xmath56 and @xmath77 .",
    "then the characteristic synchrotron frequency is @xmath78 , and the corresponding maximum flux density is @xmath79 , where the @xmath80 item in @xmath81 arises from the edge effect when @xmath82 .",
    "so , the observed optical flux density is @xmath83 .",
    "such a light curve break can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "for example , the solid line can be fit as @xmath84 during @xmath85  @xmath86 s and it is approximately @xmath87 during @xmath88  @xmath89 s. the slopes are acceptably consistent with analytic values .",
    "however , it should be noted that the break occurs obviously later than the time determined by @xmath73 , which has been pointed out by huang et al . in previous studies ( huang et al .",
    "2000a , b ) .",
    "maybe the most striking feature in fig .",
    "2b is the flattening of the light curves in the deep newtonian phase .",
    "this is not difficult to understand .",
    "in such a non - relativistic phase , the remnant , although beamed , should behaves more or less like a spherical shell since the edge effect no longer exists ( livio & waxman 2000 ) .",
    "beaming will only reduce the total flux density by a constant factor .",
    "in fact , the slope of the solid line is approximately @xmath90 after @xmath91 s , which is just the value expected for an isotropic fireball ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "so , we see that the overall evolution of optical afterglows from a conical jet without lateral expansion can be typically described by , @xmath92      in realistic cases , jets may expand laterally at comoving sound speed .",
    "3a shows the evolution of lorentz factor for such realistic conical jets .",
    "the curves can be approximately fit by @xmath93 in the highly relativistic phase and by @xmath94 in the non - relativistic phase , consistent with the analytic results of @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .",
    "again we see that @xmath23 becomes less than 5 when @xmath97  @xmath98 s.    fig .",
    "3b illustrates the @xmath54-band afterglows correspondingly .",
    "we see that the general behaviour of the light curves is very similar to that in fig .",
    "however , slight difference can still be found and deserves addressing in some detail .",
    "for example , the solid line approximately follows @xmath99 in the ultra - relativistic phase , which is steeper by @xmath100 than that in fig .",
    "it indicates that the lateral expansion tends to make the afterglow decay faster .",
    "subsequently the light curve steepens to @xmath101 , which is also steeper by @xmath102 than that in fig .",
    "it is clear that lateral expansion contributes to the light curve break significantly . in the deep newtonian phase , the light curves are again markedly characterized by a flattening .",
    "the slope of the solid line in this segment is @xmath103 , also consistent with the analytical result of @xmath90 for an isotropic fireball . in short , we conclude that the overall evolution of optical afterglows from a conical jet with lateral expansion can be typically expressed as , @xmath104      the geometry of grb jets is usually assumed to be conical .",
    "however , many of the relativistic outflows in radio galaxies are found to maintain constant cross - sections at large scales ( perley , bridle & willis 1984 ; biretta , sparks & macchetto 1999 ) . this has led cheng et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to suggest that grb jets might also be cylindrical .",
    "in fact , a very similar idea , i.e. , the so called cannon - ball model , has been suggested as the grb trigger mechanism by dar et al .",
    "( shaviv & dar 1995 ; dar 1998 ) , and observed afterglows have also been examined carefully in this frame ( dado , dar & de rjula 2002 ) .",
    "theoretical grb afterglows from cylindrical jets have been studied by cheng et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in great detail .",
    "however , their discussion again can not extend to the deep newtonian phase .",
    "here we use our revised model to continue the study .",
    "since a cylindrical jet without lateral expansion generally decelerates very slowly and can remain to be highly relativistic for as long as @xmath105  @xmath91 s ( cheng et al . 2001 ) , we will discuss only cylindrical jets with lateral expansion .",
    "4a shows the evolution of @xmath3 for some exemplary cylindrical jets . in the highly relativistic phase",
    "the curves approximately follow @xmath106 , and in the non - relativistic phase they follow @xmath107 .",
    "the timing indices are consistent with the analytical results of @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively ( cheng et al . 2001 ) .",
    "note that in this figure , @xmath23 is already less than 5 after @xmath110 ( 2  4 ) @xmath111 s. fig .",
    "4b illustrates the evolution of optical afterglows correspondingly . in the ultra - relativistic phase",
    ", the solid line can be approximated as @xmath112 , consisting with the analytical solution of @xmath113 ( cheng et al .",
    "2001 ) . after entering the non - relativistic phase ,",
    "the remnant is expected to resemble an isotropic fireball , so that the light curve should be @xmath114 ( cheng et al .",
    "taking @xmath49 , we get the analytical timing index of @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , such a flattening is really observed in fig .",
    "4b , and the slope of the solid line is just @xmath115 in the deep newtonian phase .",
    "from these studies , we see that the optical afterglow from laterally expanding cylindrical jets can typically be well represented by , @xmath116",
    "we have shown that typically in @xmath63 s , the majority of shock - accelerated electrons will become non - relativistic , i.e. , @xmath117 .",
    "these electrons can only emit cyclotron radiation which falls mainly in the frequency range of @xmath118  @xmath119 hz .",
    "however , a small portion of electrons are still highly relativistic and capable of emitting synchrotron radiation .",
    "a revised distribution function has been derived for electrons , which allows us to calculate the emission from these relativistic particles .",
    "optical afterglows from both isotropic fireballs and highly collimated jets are studied numerically based on the revised model . for isotropic fireballs , the optical light curve steepens by @xmath120 after entering the deep newtonian phase .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath121 for @xmath49 , or @xmath122 for @xmath123 . for conical jets , we find that the light curve steepens slightly later than the moment determined by @xmath124 .",
    "it is clear that this steepening is due to the edge effect and is strengthened by lateral expansion .",
    "additionally , the optical light curves are universally characterized by a striking flattening during the deep newtonian phase , which can be attributed to the resembling of the remnant to an isotropic fireball at such late stages ( livio & waxman 2000 ) .",
    "the flattening is also present in the light curves of cylindrical jets .",
    "long - lasting optical afterglows have been observed from a number of grbs , e.g. grbs 970228 , 970508 , 991208 ( fruchter et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ; castro - tirado et al . 2001 ) .",
    "optical transients in these events are typically detectable for @xmath125  200 d. our studies here are of obvious importance in such cases . however , the flattening of the light curve in the deep newtonian phase predicted for highly collimated jets has not been observed in realistic observations of jet candidates . a possible reason may be that the optical flux densities are usually too faint .",
    "in fact , to observe this flattening clearly , we should follow the optical transient for at least @xmath105 s , i.e. , more than @xmath126 years .",
    "this could hardly be actualized even with the keck telescope and the hubble space telescope .",
    "additionally , optical emission from the host galaxy makes the measurement even more difficult .",
    "anyway , the next generation optical telescopes may cast some light on the problem .",
    "radio afterglows can hopefully be observed for even longer period .",
    "in fact , a 450-day light curve of the radio afterglow of grb 970508 has been reported by frail et al .",
    "grb 980703 has even been monitored in radio bands for more than 1000 days ( kulkarni 2002 ) . at such stages",
    ", the grb remnant should have entered the deep newtonian phase .",
    "observations of radio afterglows on such a late stage have the priority that they allow for a direct measure of the intrinsic kinetic energy ( frail et al .",
    "the effect of @xmath23 will have to be considered in fitting those radio light curves theoretically .",
    "calculation of radio emission involves synchrotron self absorption , which is beyond the scope of this article and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "orphan afterglow survey is thought to be a useful method to determine the degree of beaming in grbs ( rhoads 1997 ; mszros , rees & wijers 1999 ; totani & panaitescu 2002 ; nakar , piran & granot 2002 ; granot et al .",
    "however , the method is also troubled by many problems ( dalal , griest & pruet 2002 ; huang , dai & lu 2002 ; levinson et al . 2002 ; nakar & piran 2003 ) . for example , as suggested by huang et al . ( 2002 ) , the method is greatly complicated by the possibility that there might be many failed grbs , i.e. , isotropic fireballs with @xmath127 , which can not successfully generate @xmath3-ray bursts but do can produce afterglows .",
    "anyway , a successful application of the method would involve two important ingredients : the orphan needs to be discovered as early as possible and needs to be followed as long as possible .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested that radio searches , which are capable of finding potential grb remnants as old as hundreds of days , may provide the best hope to find the missing orphans ( dalal et al .",

    "<S> gamma - ray burst remnants become trans - relativistic typically in days to tens of days , and they enter the deep newtonian phase in tens of days to months , during which the majority of shock - accelerated electrons will no longer be highly relativistic . </S>",
    "<S> however , a small portion of electrons are still accelerated to ultra - relativistic speeds and capable of emitting synchrotron radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution function for electrons is re - derived here so that synchrotron emission from these relativistic electrons can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> based on the revised model , optical afterglows from both isotropic fireballs and highly collimated jets are studied numerically , and compared to analytical results . in the beamed cases , </S>",
    "<S> it is found that , in addition to the steepening due to the edge effect and the lateral expansion effect , the light curves are universally characterized by a flattening during the deep newtonian phase .    </S>",
