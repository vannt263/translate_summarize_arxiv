    "topological crystalline insulators ( tcis ) , a new category of topological materials , were predicted@xcite and confirmed experimentally in rocksalt ( nacl - type ) snte and pb@xmath0sn@xmath1te(se ) by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite . in contrast to topological insulators where the gapless metallic surface state is protected by time - reversal symmetry , tcis have multiple dirac surface states and their topological characteristics are protected by crystalline symmetries@xcite .",
    "these surface states can generate a continuously tunable band gap by applying electric field or alloying to break the crystalline symmetry@xcite , shedding light on future applications of electronic and spintronic devices . based on tcis",
    ", superconductivity was achieved successfully in in - doped snte@xcite and pb@xmath2sn@xmath2te@xcite . in the sn@xmath0in@xmath1te superconductor , surface andreev",
    "bound states were observed by arpes , which was related to odd - parity pairing and topological superconductivity@xcite .",
    "most recently , unexpected superconductivity was reported in tci pb@xmath3sn@xmath4te by forming a mesoscopic point - contact using a normal non - superconducting elemental metal on its surface@xcite .",
    "the above experimental evidences suggest that tcis may be a promising platform to realize topological superconductivity .",
    "snse , as one of the parent compounds , is known as a material with excellent thermoelectric properties above room temperature@xcite . under ambient conditions , it has the orthorhombic ges - type structure @xcite and thus is not a tci due to the broken mirror symmetry@xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical study however , has shown that snse with the rocksalt structure could be a native tci@xcite . due to the small energy difference between the orthorhombic and rocksalt structures@xcite ,",
    "it is readily expected that snse with the rocksalt structure could be obtained experimentally .",
    "indeed , wang _ et al .",
    "_ have reported the successful synthesis of rocksalt snse in epitaxial films , where the nontrivial topology is confirmed in terms of the observation of dirac surface states by arpes@xcite .",
    "as one of the fundamental state parameters , high pressure is a clean and effective way to tune lattice as well as electronic states@xcite . while it has undergone extensive investigations during the past several decades@xcite , snse with the rocksalt structure under pressure has not been reported yet .",
    "one may note that the highest pressure investigated in these studies is generally smaller than 30 gpa , which probably limits the formation of rocksalt snse under compression .    in the present work , by extending the pressure up to 50.1 gpa in a diamond anvil cell and using synchrotron x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , we observe two structural transitions for snse : the starting orthorhombic @xmath5 structure transforms into another orthorhombic @xmath6 one ( or equivalently @xmath7 ) between 15.5 and 19.3 gpa and further to a high pressure rocksalt @xmath8 structure .",
    "the latter transition involves a large broad mixture of the @xmath6 and @xmath8 structures from 27.3 to 43.4 gpa and above 50.1 gpa the rocksalt phase establishes completely .",
    "we also observe a pressure - induced superconductivity along with the appearance of the rocksalt phase , through electrical transport measurements up to 55.0 gpa .",
    "the observation of both rocksalt structure and superconductivity at high pressures indicates that dense snse could be a topological superconductor candidate and is worthy of further theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "* structural phase trasnitions under pressure *    to search for the possible rocksalt snse at high pressure , _ in situ _ synchrotron x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) experiments were performed with snse sample up to 50.1 gpa at room temperature ( @xmath9 = 0.4246 @xmath10 ) .",
    "the experimental results are presented in fig .",
    "standard rietveld refinements were performed using gsas program@xcite .",
    "starting at 1.3 gpa , the pattern can be indexed solely by the ges - type orthorhombic structure with space group @xmath5 ( no .",
    "62 ) , which is the same as that of snse at ambient conditions@xcite . with increasing pressure ,",
    "we have identified three different phases during compression to 50.1 gpa : the low pressure phase i remains only to 15.5 gpa ( black ) ; a pure phase ii shows up in the pressure region of 19.3 - 23.0 gpa ( red ) ; a broad mixture region of phases ii and iii exists from 27.3 to 43.4 gpa ( yellow ) ; and above 50.1 gpa , a pure phase iii forms ( blue ) .",
    "it should be noted that when decompressing back to 0.3 gpa ( denoted by d ) , the xrd pattern came back to the starting structure , manifesting that the pressure - driven structural transition is reversible .",
    "we have determined that the lattice structure of phase ii is described by space group @xmath6 ( no . 63 ) or a non - standard setting of space group @xmath7 ( no . 63 ) that maintains the crystal axes in the same orientation as for the low pressure @xmath5 structure . such structural transition of @xmath5 @xmath11 @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) under pressure",
    "was also reported by previous work in bulk snse@xcite . whereas , the critical pressure in the present study ( at least @xmath12 15.5 gpa ) is higher than the value ( 10.5 gpa ) obtained previously@xcite .",
    "this discrepancy seems to be due to the sample dependency@xcite . at 50.1 gpa ,",
    "the xrd profile for phase iii can be indexed by a rocksalt nacl - type structure with space group @xmath13 ( no .",
    "225 ) . in the pressure range of 27.3 - 43.4 gpa ,",
    "the xrd pattern is a superposition of the @xmath6 and @xmath13 structures .",
    "selected xrd profile refinements are presented in fig .",
    "[ fit ] and the corresponding fitting parameters are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .    figure  [ fig4]*a * shows the variations in lattice parameters as a function of pressure . in phase",
    "i , with increasing pressure all of the lattice parameters decrease gradually . however , the @xmath14 lattice parameter is apparently more compressible than the two others , showing an anisotropic feature .",
    "this anisotropy can be related to the fact that the unit cell of snse is composed of bilayers perpendicular to the direction of the longest axis ( @xmath14 in our case , see the left frame of fig .",
    "[ fig4]*b * ) .",
    "and the van der waals force dominates between adjacent layers while strong chemical bond links the atoms within the layer .",
    "on the other hand , the lattice parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 continuously approach a same value from about 6 gpa . at about 11 gpa the axial ratio changes from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . in phase ii , while the anisotropic compressibility remains , the difference between the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 keeps almost unchanged with pressure .",
    "consequently , since the @xmath16 axis is much stiffer than @xmath15 axis ( fig .  [ fig4]*a * ) , it thus is inferred that the transition from phases i to ii is related to a displacive movement of sn / se atoms along the [ 010 ] direction ( or @xmath15 axis ) , which is in accordance with previous reports@xcite .",
    "note that , over the transition , all the lattice parameters evolve almost smoothly with pressure , indicating the transition to be a second order .",
    "it is also interesting to see that the lattice of snse approaches a tetragonal metric around 11 gpa , but remains orthorhombic at all pressures for phase i and phase ii .",
    "such displacive structural transition and the modified tetragonal metric at high pressure are quite similar to those of snse at elevated temperature@xcite .",
    "phase iii starts to appear at 27.3 gpa and the lattice parameter `` @xmath14 '' decreases slightly with pressure up to 50.1 gpa , the highest pressure achieved in the present xrd experiments .",
    "the discontinuous change of lattice parameters from phases ii to iii implies that the transition is a first order .",
    "a broad pressure region of coexistence between phase ii and iii is observed , and thus it is hard to determine the exact critical pressure . here",
    "the critical pressure from phase ii to iii is defined as the one above which phase iii appears indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig4]*a*. based on the variation of lattice parameters with pressure from phase ii to iii , one can find that the high pressure structural transition roughly involves two factors : first , a gradual decreasing of the interlayer spacing ; second , a lateral shifting of adjacent layers . and finally a bonding of sn to se from neighboring layers occurs , which makes the transition from a predominantly two - dimensional ( 2d ) material ( phase ii ) to a three - dimensional ( 3d ) network ( phase iii ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4]*b*.    the isothermal equations of state for phase i , ii and iii are plotted in fig .  [ fig4]*c*. the isothermal equations of state were fitted by the third - order birch - murnaghan formula@xcite as indicated by the solid lines .",
    "the calculated parameters are : the bulk moduli @xmath19 = 39.8 gpa , and its first derivative @xmath20 = 4.31 for phase i ; @xmath19 = 55.4 gpa , and @xmath20 = 4.55 for phase ii ; and @xmath19 = 94.9 gpa , and @xmath20 = 4.83 for phase iii .",
    "the estimated volume at zero pressure are @xmath21 = 214.4 @xmath22 for phase i , @xmath21 = 198.0 @xmath22 for phase ii , and @xmath21 = 120.0 @xmath22 for phase iii .",
    "the obtained @xmath19 of phase i is in reasonable agreement with the reported experimental and theoretical values @xcite .",
    "note that the bulk moduli of phase iii is substantially larger than that of phase ii , which can be related to the observation of a pressure - induced 2d to 3d structural transition .",
    "in addition , the unit cell volume shrinks at a ratio as high as 33.5% for the high pressure transition but only 2% for the low pressure one .",
    "such a large volume collapse phenomenon was also observed in previous high pressure xrd studies@xcite .",
    "* pressure - induced superconductivity *    it is well known that , at ambient conditions , snse exists in a thermodynamically stable ges - type orthorhombic structure . here",
    ", high pressure snse with a rocksalt structure is rather interesting : first , rocksalt snse has been predicted theoretically to be a native tci@xcite ; second , it stabilizes at ambient conditions via epitaxial film growth method , in which the dirac surface states of the topological phase were successfully observed by arpes experiments@xcite . since its topological nature of electronic states is protected only by lattice symmetry@xcite , the rocksalt snse accessed by high pressure thus may be a candidate of a bulk tci . to investigate its high pressure manifestations in electronic properties",
    ", we carried out electrical transport measurements on single crystal snse up to 55.0 gpa .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the temperature dependence of the @xmath23 electrical resistance of snse in the temperature range of 1.8 - 300 k. from fig .",
    "[ fig1]*a * , at 0.4 gpa a semiconducting behavior ( @xmath24 @xmath25 0 ) is observed in the whole temperature range as that of semiconducting snse at ambient pressure@xcite . with increasing pressure ,",
    "the whole resistance decreases rapidly implying a remarkable reduction in the energy gap of the material with pressure ( see the arrhenius fits to the resistance data in fig .",
    "[ gap ] ) . from 5.4 to 9.0 gpa while the semiconducting behavior remains at high temperatures ( above @xmath26 250 k ) , a metallic - like feature ( @xmath24 @xmath12 0 ) shows up at low temperatures . at 12.0 gpa , a typical metallic character is observed . at the same time , the resistance at 2 k drops about six orders of magnitude with respect to that at 0.4 gpa .",
    "these observations signal a crossover from semiconductor to metal under pressure . recall that in above xrd experiments , from about 6 gpa the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 approach gradually to the same value ( see fig .  [ fig4]*a * ) . in addition , a crossover from @xmath17 to @xmath18",
    "was observed at about 11 gpa . as a result",
    ", there is a close correlation between the electrical and structural properties . since the @xmath16 axis is much stiffer than @xmath15 axis , it thus can be inferred that the metallization of snse under pressure is related to the atomic displacement along the [ 010 ] direction ( or @xmath15 axis ) . here",
    "the critical pressure ( 12.0 gpa ) of metallization for snse is in excellent accordance with the one ( 12.6 gpa ) obtained from previous resistance experiments although the latter was performed in the temperature range of 80 - 270 k@xcite .",
    "when the pressure goes up to 17.3 gpa , however , the resistance reveals an abnormal overall rise in addition to the metallic feature as indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1]*b*. this can be ascribed to the structural transition from phase i to ii , which is triggered by the displacive movement of sn / se atoms and the increase of the atomic coordination via bonding of the non - bonding in - plane sn to se atoms , along the [ 010 ] direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]*b * ) .    upon further compression , the resistance becomes more and more metallic .",
    "the most striking finding is that at 27.2 gpa a drop of resistance is initially observed below about 2.5 k as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1]*c * and in fig .",
    "[ fig1]*d * , an enlarged view of the low temperature region of resistance .",
    "this sharp drop should be a signal of a superconducting transition as zero resistance is observed at 2 k at 34.3 gpa .",
    "the critical temperature , @xmath27 , is defined as the onset of the superconducting phase transition .",
    "further increasing pressure , it first increases slightly , reaches a maximum of about 3 k at 39.0 gpa and then decreases gradually to 2.5 k at 55.0 gpa , the highest pressure achieved in the present measurement .",
    "it should be noted here that the pressure - induced superconductivity is only observed being accompanied by the appearance of the high pressure rocksalt phase above about 27 gpa .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the resistance at low temperatures in the normal state keeps substantially unchanged , i.e. showing pressure- and temperature - independent behaviors ( above  39.0  gpa ; below @xmath26 70  k ) within the experimental uncertainties .    to further confirm that the drop in resistance belongs to a superconducting transition , we measured the low temperature resistance at 39.0 gpa under applied magnetic fields parallel to the [ 100 ] direction , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2]*a*. with increasing field , @xmath27 decreases gradually and the resistance drop was almost smeared out at 0.5 t , which confirms that the drop of resistance is the superconducting transition .",
    "in addition , the resistance versus temperature curves are almost parallel to each other , suggesting that the flux creep effects can be ignored in the vortex dynamics of superconductivity .",
    "we have plotted the upper critical field @xmath28 as a function of temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig2]*b*. here @xmath29 is defined from the resistance criterion of @xmath30 = 90%@xmath31 ( @xmath31 is the normal state resistance ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath28 follows a linear dependence in temperature ( red dashed line ) . by extrapolating it to zero temperature",
    ", @xmath32 is estimated to be 1.12 t. the linear feature of @xmath28 and the value of @xmath32 are quite similar to those observed in in - doped snte@xcite and sn@xmath33ag@xmath34te@xcite , potential candidates where topological superconductivity may emerge@xcite . here , the pauli paramagnetic effect does not apply since the pauli limiting field is about 5.4 t ( 1.84 @xmath35 @xmath27 ) , suggestive of an absence of pauli pair breaking .    * phase diagram of snse under pressure *    all of the results are outlined in a phase diagram as exhibited in fig .",
    "it is easy to find that the structural and electronic properties correlate with each other intimately in the whole pressure range studied .",
    "roughly , the phase diagram can be divided into four different regions based on the lattice symmetry upon compression .",
    "for the low pressure @xmath5 structure , the pristine semiconducting behavior gradually develops into a metallic state , with the resistance at 2 k ( left axis of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) and at room temperature ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) decreasing 4 - 6 orders in magnitude .",
    "when entering into the @xmath6 structure , the resistance exhibits a sudden increase as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( left axis and inset ) and more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig1]*b*. then with increasing pressure it decreases continuously and becomes more and more metallic .",
    "accompanied by the appearance of the high pressure modification @xmath13 , superconductivity is observed initially around 27 gpa . upon further compression , a broad pressure region for the structural mixture",
    "exists followed by a complete @xmath13 structure above about 50 gpa .",
    "meanwhile , the critical temperature @xmath27 first increases slightly and reaches a maximum value of about 3 k at 39.0 gpa , and then decreases gradually up to 55.0 gpa , showing a `` dome '' like @xmath36 superconducting phase diagram .",
    "snse at ambient conditions crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure ( @xmath5 ) which can be described as a distortion of the simple cubic structure of nacl .",
    "the present xrd results evidence a set of structural transitions from the low pressure @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( or equivalently @xmath7 ) , and over a very broad pressure range further to a high pressure nacl - type rocksalt structure ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the transition of @xmath5 @xmath11 @xmath6 mainly refers to a displacive movement of sn / se atoms along the [ 010 ] direction ( or @xmath15 axis ) while @xmath6 @xmath11 @xmath13 involves additionally sn - se bonding between adjacent layers , owing to anisotropic compression .",
    "correspondingly , the nearest coordination numbers of sn increases sequentially from three to five , and finally to six .",
    "this makes the transition of snse from a predominantly 2d material to a 3d network , which can also be manifested in the increasing bulk moduli under compression ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]*c * ) . through previous structural investigations in pb- or sn - based iv - vi compounds@xcite ,",
    "it has been a recurring theme of phase transitions : @xmath5 @xmath37 @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) @xmath37 @xmath13 , indicating that the energy differences between these structures are fairly tiny .",
    "it thus not unexpected here that a rocksalt phase establishes for snse at high pressures .",
    "the observed structural phase transitions are consistent well with the variation of resistance with pressure . in phase",
    "i , the resistance of snse decreases monotonously upon compression , with the rapid closure of its band - gap ( fig .",
    "[ gap ] ) followed by metallization ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]*a * ) .",
    "when snse entering into the @xmath6 phase , the magnitude of the resistance shows an abnormal upshift ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]*b * ) .",
    "most strikingly , superconductivity is observed accompanied by the appearance of the high pressure rocksalt phase .",
    "note that with increasing pressure , superconductivity first shows up at 27.2 gpa and zero resistance can only be observed above 34.3 gpa ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]*d * ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the coexistence of the non - superconducting @xmath6 and superconducting @xmath13 structures .",
    "recently , a large amount of efforts have been devoted to exploring the possible topological superconductors in topological materials by external pressure , such as bi@xmath38se@xmath39@xcite , bi@xmath38te@xmath39@xcite , zrte@xmath40@xcite , cd@xmath39as@xmath38@xcite , sr doped bi@xmath38se@xmath39@xcite , etc .",
    "however , one may find that the appearance of superconductivity is generally along with a structural transition , making it an open question on the topology of the pressure - induced superconducting states in these materials . in this regard , here",
    "the discovered superconductivity for snse rooted inherently in the rocksalt structure at high pressures may be of particular interest .",
    "firstly , for snse with a rocksalt structure , it has been theoretically predicted to be a native tci@xcite . in the epitaxial film rocksalt snse , dirac surface states",
    "have been observed experimentally by arpes@xcite .",
    "consequently , the rocksalt phase of snse accessed through high pressure may also possess the unique topological characteristic as it is protected only by crystal symmetry .",
    "secondly , superconductivity is observed in the rocksalt snse .",
    "several previous works in a prototypical tci snte have reported that superconductivity can be achieved by substitutions@xcite . remarkably , surface andreev bound states@xcite were observed , which was related to odd - parity pairing and topological superconductivity@xcite .",
    "it is noted that the resistance in the normal state reveals temperature ( below @xmath26 70 k ) and pressure ( above 39.0 gpa ) independent behaviors within the experimental uncertainties . as a matter of fact",
    ", such temperature independent electronic transport behavior has also been observed in other topological materials@xcite , which might be related to the presence of topological surface states .",
    "considering the extreme similarities both in structural and electronic manifestations between doped snte and the present dense snse , we thus expect that the latter may also be a promising candidate to realize topological superconductivity .",
    "obviously , more detailed understandings remain to be uncovered by further theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the high pressure modification of @xmath6 snse resembles closely that of snse at elevated temperature@xcite , with an intersection of axes and approaching a tetragonal metric .",
    "upon further warming , unfortunately , a sublimation happens before a possible rocksalt snse may generate . as a result , in addition to epitaxy - grown films@xcite , the present study may offer an alternative strategy for synthesizing rocksalt snse via a combination of high pressure and high temperature techniques , and thereby test for possible topological superconductivity .    in summary , in order to search for the possible rocksalt snse , we performed synchrotron xrd experiments in a diamond anvil cell and indeed observed the formation of a rocksalt phase at high pressures .",
    "we found that the rocksalt phase appears at 27.3 gpa and coexists with the @xmath6 ( or equivalently @xmath7 ) phase in a broad pressure range , and eventually a pure rocksalt phase establishes above 50.1 gpa .",
    "anisotropic compression is suggested to be responsible for the structural transitions .",
    "we further carried out electronic transport measurements to investigate the properties of the rocksalt phase .",
    "interestingly , we observed a pressure - driven superconductivity rooted in the rocksalt structure .",
    "it is thus proposed that the present dense snse may provide a model platform to investigate the topological characteristic of electronic structures and its correlation to superconductivity .",
