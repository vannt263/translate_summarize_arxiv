    "the _ spectral dimension _",
    "@xmath0 was first introduced by alexander and orbach @xcite to characterize the low frequency vibration spectrum of fractals . nowadays ,",
    "it is considered by most the right generalization of the euclidean dimension of regular lattices to irregular structures in general , whether fractal or not , such as polymers , glasses , percolation clusters , dendritic growths and so on .",
    "this is verified at least in many experimental situations , as well as in some theoretical model examples , whenever the physical dimensionality explicitly enter observables such as the spectrum of density fluctuations , the long time properties of random walks , the critical exponents of statistical models and many others .    in a theoretical",
    "setting , we may consider a connected graph as model of generic irregular structure , with physical microscopic degrees of freedom attached to the nodes and interaction among them associated to the links .",
    "this scheme implies that the coordination of nodes is bounded ( the number of nearest neighbors of an atom , molecule or basic building block has a geometrical upper bound ) and , if the graph in question is infinite , that the surface of any van hove ball ( defined in terms of the chemical distance alone ) must be negligible with respect to the volume when its radius goes to infinity . in other , more physically immediate words",
    ", we say that the structure is embeddable as a whole in a finite  dimensional euclidean space and a standard thermodynamic limit of infinite systems exists .",
    "we are thus led to consider _ bounded graphs _",
    "@xcite and to study their spectral dimension .",
    "to be precise , we refer here to the _ average _ spectral dimension , that is a global property of the graph , related for instance to the infrared singularity of the gaussian process or , equivalently , to the density of small eigenvalues of the laplacian or the graph average of the long  time tail of the random walk return probability @xcite .",
    "on macroscopically inhomogeneous structures this average dimension may differ from the local one , which enters the long  time tail of the random walk return probability on a given node @xcite .",
    "however , it is the average spectral dimension that plays the same role of the lattice euclidean dimension in many contexts , as for instance in providing a consistent criterion on whether a continuous symmetry breaks down at low temperatures @xcite .    in this work",
    "we address the problem of determining the average spectral dimension of bounded trees and in particular of statistically homogeneous random trees @xcite ( this homogeneity actually implies that local and average spectral dimensions coincide ) , which are defined by the following branching algorithm : given a set of coordination fractions @xmath1 that are properly normalized and have average coordination 2 @xmath2 an infinite random tree is built by first selecting with probability @xmath3 the coordination of the origin and then , proceeding shell by shell away from the origin , by choosing the coordination of every new node with probability @xmath3 except for the first node of each shell , when the modified probability @xmath4 is used to implement the non  extinction preconditioning ( this is algorithm * b * of @xcite ) .",
    "these random trees represent a generalization of the incipient infinite percolation clusters on bethe lattices @xcite , since the branching probabilities are freely assigned rather than being fixed by a single percolation probability .",
    "they also generalize to arbitrary coordination fractions @xmath3 the infinitely large specimens of the branched polymers studied for instance in @xcite .",
    "since the introduction of spectral dimension , the value of @xmath5 has been conjectured for the incipient infinite percolation cluster in any dimension .",
    "this conjecture was proved false at low dimensions , while has been considered valid in the limit of infinite dimension ( percolation on bethe lattices ) .",
    "leyvraz and stanley @xcite had in fact produced an heuristic scaling argument in favor of @xmath5 already in 1983 .",
    "several years later , a more rigorous approach was pursued in @xcite , where the branched polymer phase of two  dimensional quantum gravity was proved to have indeed @xmath6 .",
    "branched polymers correspond to a grandcanonical ensemble of trees with all possible sizes , which is generated by a branching process like ours above but without the non  extinction preconditioning . in this case",
    "the definition itself of spectral dimension is subtle since such concept does not apply to finite graphs .",
    "this is the major difficulty in the approach of @xcite .",
    "another mathematically well founded approach to the problem is given in @xcite , where the exponent @xmath7 of the anomalous diffusion on our class of random trees is determined as @xmath8 ( the author reports only the shorter and simpler of two different derivations , which turns out to be more than twenty pages long and states that the other , more complete treatment is `` monstrously long '' ) .",
    "it is commonly held , although never rigorously established in general , that @xmath7 is connected to the spectral dimension and the ( average ) connectivity ( or intrinsic hausdorff ) dimension @xmath9 as : @xmath10 therefore @xmath8 would imply @xmath5 , since @xmath11 for random trees @xcite .",
    "in this paper we provide a new , independent and fairly rigorous derivation of @xmath5 based on the infrared properties of the gaussian model on our random trees ( section [ scaling ] ) .",
    "the connection of the gaussian model with the random walk on any graph is a well known fact that we briefly review for completeness in section [ gauss ] . as a byproduct ,",
    "we obtain also an argument in favor of the conjecture , for any infinite graph for which the thermodynamic limit of the gaussian model exists : it is natural in fact to expect the scaling form @xmath12 for the effective squared mass of the gaussian model in terms of a very small `` bare '' squared mass @xmath13 and the very large radius of a graph ( see section [ gauss ] for the proper definitions ) ; moreover we conjecture also that the finite  size exponent @xmath14 coincides with @xmath15 , which is called sometimes _ random walk dimension _ and characterizes the scaling @xmath16 between the time needed by a random walker to visit with non  negligible frequency nodes at distance @xmath17 from its starting point ; then the existence of the thermodynamic limit on the effective mass implies that @xmath18 and so @xmath19 yielding exactly equation , since in general @xmath20 as @xmath21 ( see section [ gauss ] ) .    in our treatment of random trees we are indeed able to explicitly derive the scaling law with @xmath11 and @xmath22 , demonstrating @xmath23 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that if the scaling law is assumed a priori , with @xmath11 as well known for random trees , then the precise numerical value of @xmath14 ( and therefore of @xmath0 ) follows from a very simple `` geometrical '' fact : as shown in section [ scaling ] , the first correction to the finite tree behaviour @xmath24 comes from the sum of squared volumes of all subtrees , which grows like @xmath25 if the volume of tree grows like @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath27 which is also a known conjecture , even with @xmath28 , for the incipient percolation cluster and other tree  like disordered structures @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath0 is monotonically increasing from @xmath29 to @xmath30 as @xmath9 grows from @xmath29 to @xmath31 .",
    "let us observe that @xmath11 and @xmath23 are the greatest value among all known average connectivity and spectral dimensions for bounded trees .",
    "this fact lead us to formulate the following conjecture : for all bounded trees @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with saturation only in the case of random trees .",
    "evidently this must be true only for the _ average _ dimensions ; there indeed exist examples of trees ( such as @xmath34 @xcite ) whose _ local _ connectivity and spectral dimension , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , exceed @xmath31 and @xmath30 , respectively ; these present however macroscopic inhomogeneities so that the local dimensions are different from the average ones which do satisfy the bounds at @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "let us observe also that equation does not apply in the same examples if the average dimensions are replaced by the local ones .",
    "at the moment these upper bounds are only conjectured , but it has been rigorously proved that @xmath37 , since bounded trees are always recurrent on the average @xcite .",
    "the gaussian model on a generic connected infinite graph @xmath38 is defined @xcite by assigning a real  valued random variable @xmath39 to each node @xmath40 with the following probability distribution @xmath41 = \\frac1{z_r }           \\exp\\bigl[-\\tfrac12\\!\\!\\!\\ !",
    "\\sum_{x , y \\in b(o , r)}\\phi_x ( l_{xy } +           \\mu_0\\delta_{xy})\\phi_y \\bigr ] \\prod_{x\\in b(x , r ) } d\\phi_x\\ ] ] for the collection @xmath42 relative to any van hove ball @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the chemical distance . in equation",
    "@xmath45 is the proper normalization factor ( the partition function ) , @xmath46 is a free parameter ( the squared mass in field  theoretic sense ) and @xmath47 is ( minus ) the laplacian matrix on @xmath38 , @xmath48 being the coordination or degree of @xmath49 and @xmath50 the adjacency matrix ) .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is achieved by letting @xmath51 and defines a gaussian measure for the whole field @xmath52 which does not depend on the center @xmath53 of the ball @xcite if @xmath38 is bounded .",
    "the covariance of this gaussian process reads @xmath54 and setting @xmath55 one obtains the standard connection with the random walks over @xmath38 @xcite : @xmath56\\ ] ] where the last sum runs over all paths from @xmath57 to @xmath49 , each weighted by the product along the path of the one  step jump probabilities in @xmath58 : @xmath59 = w_{xy_{t-1 } } w_{y_{t-1}y_{t-2}},\\ldots , w_{y_2y_1}w_{y_1y}\\ ] ] notice that , as long as @xmath46 , we have @xmath60 for any @xmath61 , namely the walker has a nonzero death probability .",
    "this implies that @xmath62 is a smooth functions of @xmath13 for @xmath63 . in the limit",
    "@xmath64 the walker never dies and the standard random walk is recovered ; then the sum over paths in equation ( [ eq : rw ] ) is dominated by the infinitely long paths which sample the large scale structure of the entire graph ( `` large scale '' refers here to the metric induced by the chemical distance alone ) .",
    "this typically reflects itself into a singularity of @xmath62 at @xmath65 .",
    "consider for instance a diagonal element @xmath66 of the covariance and suppose that its singularity is power ",
    "like @xmath67 then by equation one sees that the same power  like behaviour appears , as @xmath68 , in the discrete laplace transform @xmath69 of the random walks return probability @xmath70 at @xmath49 . in turn",
    "this implies the long time behaviour @xmath71 identifying @xmath36 with the local spectral dimension , which does not depend on the specific node @xmath49 @xcite . to be precise the denomination `` spectral dimension '' refers to the behaviour of the spectral density @xmath72 of low - lying eigenvalues of the laplacian @xmath73 , namely @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , it can be shown @xcite that @xmath0 is connected to the long time behaviour of the graph average of @xmath70 , or equivalently to the infrared power  like singularity of the graph average @xmath75 of @xmath66 , that is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the volume of @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath0 is therefore called sometimes `` average '' spectral dimension . on regular lattices",
    "it coincides with the local spectral dimension and the usual euclidean dimension .    by definition",
    ", the diagonal elements @xmath66 of the covariance may be written as @xmath79 where @xmath80\\ ,    \\delta(\\phi_x-\\varphi)\\ ] ] thanks to the fundamental self  reproducing property of gaussian integrations , @xmath81 is necessarily a normalized gaussian in @xmath82 , that is @xmath83 where , for consistency with equation @xmath84 is the `` effective mass '' at @xmath49 .",
    "let us now consider the gaussian model on an infinite bounded tree @xmath85 .",
    "any node @xmath86 may be regarded as the root of an infinite branching process which produces @xmath85 as family tree rooted at @xmath49 .",
    "this simply means that @xmath49 has as many descendants , or children , as its coordination @xmath48 , while any other node @xmath87 has @xmath88 children one step further away from the unique ancestor @xmath49 and a father one step closer to @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath48 children @xmath57 of @xmath49 are themselves roots of disjoint subtrees , or branches @xmath89 , which may or may not be infinite .",
    "now , by the simple rules of gaussian integration , one easily verifies the following relation between the effective mass at @xmath49 , relative to the entire @xmath85 and the effective masses at children @xmath57 of @xmath49 , each one relative to the corresponding branch @xmath89 : @xmath90 = \\mu_0\\ , + \\sch     \\frac{\\mu_y[\\t'_y]}{1+\\mu_y[\\t'_y]}\\ ] ] a similar relation holds for the effective masses @xmath91 $ ] in terms of the @xmath92 masses of @xmath57 s children , and so on for the rest of the tree .    next",
    ", suppose that the branching process is the galton ",
    "watson random one , with the non  extinction preconditioning , described in the introduction ( and in more detail in @xcite ) , so that @xmath85 is an infinite random tree . because of the preconditioning , @xmath85 may be regarded as the union of infinitely many subtrees generated by independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random branching processes , without the non  extinction preconditioning , whose roots are attached to the nodes of a half  infinite chain ( the spine ) that starts from @xmath49 .",
    "this means that only one of the branches at @xmath49 is a priori guaranteed to extend to infinity , while the other @xmath93 are the family trees of i.i.d .",
    "random branching processes which might stop after finitely many generations .",
    "let us consider first the probability distributions relative the branching process itself and in particular the probability @xmath94 that the effective mass at the root @xmath49 be exactly @xmath95 when the branching algorithm is iterated for @xmath17 generations , that is @xmath96 where the average is over all realizations of the tree with @xmath17 generations , namely on all possible histories of the branching algorithm with @xmath17 shells completed .",
    "taking equation and the spinal decomposition into account ,",
    "we may write @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the same probability without the non  extinction preconditioning and fulfills the functional recursion @xmath99 while @xmath100 is the probability when also the coordination of the root is extracted with the modified probability @xmath101 and satisfies therefore @xmath102 as @xmath51 we expect all these probability distributions to converge to their limiting forms @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , turning eqs . , and into highly nontrivial coupled integro  functional equations for @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath106 with a parametric dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "in particular we are interested in their infrared behaviour as @xmath21 .",
    "before addressing the just mentioned problem , we need to establish the precise relation with the original problem , that of determining the @xmath21 behaviour of @xmath75 on a given `` generic '' infinite random tree @xmath85 produced by our algorithm . by `` generic '' in this context we mean an infinite @xmath85 belonging to the subset of unit measure of trees that fulfill the _ auto  averaging property _ for local observables . to be explicit , consider the frequency @xmath107 of occurrence in @xmath85 of a given rooted tree @xmath108 with @xmath17 generations . in terms of the van hove balls @xmath109 , regarded as subtrees of @xmath85 , we may write @xmath107 as the graph average @xmath110\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is an arbitrary node of @xmath85 and @xmath111 $ ] is one if its argument is a true statement and zero otherwise . @xmath107 does not depend on the choice of @xmath53 ( @xmath85 is a bounded graph ) and it is convenient to identify it @xmath53 with the root , or origin , of the infinite branching algorithm .",
    "let us then recall that any @xmath85 produced by the algorithm may be decomposed into the spine @xmath112 ( the origin @xmath53 plus all the nodes on which the coordination was extracted with @xmath101 ) and the _ transverse _ family trees of the identical , independent and non preconditioned branching processes starting from the nodes of the spine ( see @xcite@xcite for more details ) .",
    "evidently , the interesection of the transverse family trees rooted at @xmath113 with @xmath114 contains at most @xmath115 generations , so that they contribute differently , even on average , to @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , to simplify our derivation , we consider a modified thermodynamic limit , in which the infinite tree is not recovered through a van hove ball with diverging radius , but as @xmath117 limit of the set @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the restriction of the spine to the first @xmath120 generations of @xmath85 and @xmath121 are the union of all transverse family trees rooted at @xmath122 and restricted to the first @xmath120 generations . thus we redefine @xmath116 as @xmath123\\ ] ] notice that , by construction , the random weights @xmath124 are all identically distributed and are all independent except for the normalization constraint @xmath125 .",
    "the random frequencies @xmath126 are all identically distributed , but are not independent because a ball @xmath109 will in general intersect several @xmath121 if @xmath127 .",
    "therefore we split @xmath121 into @xmath128 , formed by nodes @xmath49 such that @xmath129 , and its complement @xmath130 , which does not depend on @xmath120 for large @xmath120 .",
    "this implies an analogous splitting for the random weights and the random frequencies . now the random frequencies @xmath131 are all independent since the two events @xmath132 and @xmath133 are independent if @xmath134 and @xmath135 with @xmath136 .",
    "notice also that @xmath126 and @xmath137 are independent when @xmath136 .",
    "thus we have @xmath138 with @xmath139 getting contributions solely from nodes at distance not larger than @xmath17 from the spine .",
    "clearly , in the limit @xmath117 , these nodes form a subset of zero measure of @xmath85 , since @xmath140 is essentially one dimensional while a generic @xmath85 has @xmath11 .",
    "hence , as @xmath117 , @xmath141 by analogous dimensionality arguments we get that almost always @xmath142 , although the sum of all these random weights stays properly normalized .",
    "we may now invoke directly the law of large numbers for @xmath143 , which is the weighted average of i.i.d .",
    "random variables .",
    "hence , for any _ finite _ @xmath17 , @xmath107 is almost always non  fluctuating on infinite trees and @xmath144 where @xmath145 is anyone of the @xmath146 and the average @xmath147 is taken with respect to the algorithm without the preconditioning on non  extinction . but",
    "any node @xmath49 on such trees laying at a distance larger then @xmath17 from the origin enjoys _ statistical homogeneity _ for the event @xmath132 , since the branching is i.i.d . on every node ( but the origin , at most ) and",
    "@xmath132 can not contain the origin .",
    "moreover , the unique path connecting @xmath49 to @xmath53 plays the role of the spine for a branching process rooted at @xmath49 and preconditioned on non  extinction for at least @xmath17 generations , since the trees contributing to @xmath148 have at least @xmath17 generations . we conclude therefore that almost always an infinite random tree @xmath85 has the auto ",
    "averaging property @xmath149 \\rangle}\\ ] ] with respect to the probability itself that the first @xmath17 shells of @xmath85 build up to form the given finite tree @xmath108 . then this property holds for any local observable and in particular for the effective mass @xmath150 $ ] of a gaussian models restricted to @xmath109 .",
    "thus the probability distribution @xmath94 coincides with the frequency of the event @xmath150=\\mu$ ] , as @xmath49 varies throughout a `` generic '' infinite random tree @xmath85 .",
    "the same would evidently apply to the probability distribution of the variable @xmath151 and the frequency of the event @xmath152=(2\\mu)^{-1}$ ] .",
    "let us now return to the recursion relations , and for the probability distributions @xmath94 , @xmath153 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the thermodynamic limit @xmath51 of infinite trees followed by the massless limit @xmath21 .",
    "this two limits can actually be applied simultaneously , provided we identify the correct scaling variables .",
    "suppose in fact that , as @xmath51 _ and _ @xmath154 , the scaling law applies ; since @xmath95 is a really a random variable , a better formulation is in terms of its probability , that is @xmath155 for suitable scaling exponents @xmath156 and @xmath14 and scaling function @xmath157 .",
    "@xmath156 is then directly related to the spectral dimension , as @xmath158 , thanks to equation , the results of the previous section and the existence of the thermodynamic limit ; @xmath14 provides instead a measure of finite  size effects at very large sizes .",
    "in particular , if we let @xmath21 too fast , so that @xmath159 even if @xmath51 , we must recover the massless behaviour characteristic of finite trees .",
    "this amounts to linearize the effective mass formula , so that @xmath160 = \\mu_0 v[\\t]\\ ] ] where @xmath161 $ ] is the volume of @xmath85 .",
    "thus @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the volume probability at radius @xmath17 , which for large @xmath17 has a scaling form in terms of @xmath164 explicitly determined in @xcite ( thus implying @xmath11 ) .",
    "since this scaling form is highly nontrivial , with exponentially small behaviour also for @xmath165 , compatibility with the scaling hypothesis requires @xmath166 , that is @xmath167 one is therefore lead to the identification ( compare with equation in the introduction ) @xmath168 relating finite  size effects to the exponent of anomalous diffusion . of course",
    ", since the relation is only a well founded conjecture , an explicit derivation of @xmath169 would provide a proof of the conjecture for our random trees .",
    "let us stress the point : @xmath14 measures the scaling behaviour of the gaussian model ( and therefore of the random walk ) on finite random trees of very large radius @xmath17 ; @xmath170 characterizes instead the scaling @xmath16 between the time needed by a random walker to visit with non  negligible frequency nodes at distance @xmath17 from its starting point .",
    "the two concepts are certainly related but quite distinct , so that the identification @xmath169 has a nontrivial content .",
    "let us come back now to the opposite limiting behaviour of the probability distributions that is the subject of this work , namely @xmath51 and @xmath154 with @xmath171 fixed and @xmath172 finite and possibly very large .",
    "we shall show now that the scaling law is indeed correct with the precise values @xmath173 implying @xmath23 .",
    "the detailed proof , by induction on all moments of @xmath94 , @xmath153 and @xmath100 is rather simple albeit notationally a bit cumbersome and is reported in the appendix .",
    "here we only provide a sketch of the derivation .",
    "the first step consists in rewriting the recursion relations , and into a more tractable form .",
    "in fact they are amenable to a direct treatment via laplace transform only in the limit @xmath21 at fixed @xmath17 , while we are interested in a regime where the nonlinearity in the effective mass formula plays a crucial role .",
    "therefore we consider the expansion in all powers of @xmath13 @xmath174 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } ( -1)^{n+1 } v_n(x ) \\mu_0^n\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath175 are integer  valued random variables satisfying composition laws obtained by equating powers of @xmath13 on both sides of equation . these read @xmath176 \\\\",

    "now we may write recursion relations for the probability of the coefficients @xmath175 themselves .",
    "for instance , in the branching algorithm without non  extinction preconditioning , we have @xmath181 with similar expressions for probabilities @xmath182 and @xmath183 corresponding to those for the effective mass @xmath94 and @xmath100 . for brevity we do not write them here ; they can be found in the appendix .    the advantage of this new formulation stands in the fact that @xmath184 is by construction linear in @xmath185 .",
    "this allows to set up a systematic control of the large @xmath17 behaviour of the recursion relations for the multiple moments of @xmath182 , @xmath186 and @xmath183 .",

    "we demonstrate by induction that , as @xmath51 @xmath217\\ ] ] hence , by retaining only the dominant @xmath218behaviour , we have @xmath219 and , by the same token @xmath220 similarly one obtain for any @xmath221 @xmath222 so that , requiring the existence of thermodynamic limit , one obtains as @xmath223 at @xmath224 @xmath225 where @xmath226 we may also reformulate this result as @xmath227 where @xmath228 has a finite nonzero limit as @xmath202 .",
    "this general form of the moments of @xmath199 implies the scaling form with @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 for the probability @xmath199 itself .",
    "let us close this section with one more observation concerning the universality of the scaling law or with respect to the coordination distribution defined by the @xmath3 numbers or , equivalently , by the probability generating function @xmath188 .",
    "a more careful analysis of the dominant large @xmath17 terms in the recursion rules for @xmath232 expectations shows that ( see appendix for details ) @xmath233 where @xmath234 measures the fluctuations of the coordinations since @xmath235 we may therefore refine the scaling law to @xmath236 where @xmath157 is a universal scaling function .",
    "lines of constant integrated probability from numerical data.,height=491 ]    as an extra check on our derivation and to determine the profile of the universal function @xmath157 , we numerically evaluated @xmath199 by directly calculating the effective mass @xmath95 for each member of a large set of trees produced by our branching algorithm .",
    "for each one of the selected values of @xmath13 and @xmath17 we obtained several thousand values of @xmath95 that may be arranged into an histogram providing a discretized estimate of @xmath237 . this procedure does not require much computer time or memory thanks to the recursive structure of the mass composition formula .",
    "our results for the integrated probability at the five values @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 are plotted in figure  [ probmu ] using the scaling variables @xmath243 and @xmath244 ( with our specific choice of @xmath3 we have @xmath245 ) .",
    "the data show a very good scaling profile with a very well defined crossover , as @xmath122 gets larger , from the behaviour typical of small trees , @xmath246 , to that characteristic of large trees , that is @xmath247 .",
    "the vertical section of data at @xmath248 provides a good estimate of the probability distribution @xmath249 and is reported in figure  [ distmu ] .     numerical distribution for f(u , s ) for 10000 random trees.,height=491 ]",
    "let us remark once more on the two distinct levels of our approach : our proof by induction of equation provides a rigorous basis for the scaling form of @xmath199 with @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "thanks to the auto ",
    "averaging property , this implies in turn that indeed @xmath250 moreover , due to the statistical homogeneity of our random trees , we see that the local and average spectral dimension coincide . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume scaling , as natural and common in this contexts , then the determination @xmath5 follows solely and very simply from the large @xmath17 asymptotic behaviour of @xmath251 , that is the average of the sum of squared volumes of all subtrees of the tree .",
    "since the volume @xmath179 scales as @xmath252 , with @xmath11 , then @xmath180 must scale , almost by definition , as @xmath25 ; then @xmath253 which is consistent with scaling only if @xmath254 notice that this holds true even if @xmath255 , as could happen for different types of bounded trees .",
    "we conjectured in @xcite that @xmath256 for any bounded tree , with saturation only for random trees .",
    "then automatically @xmath257 for any bounded tree , with saturation only for random trees .",
    "the general expression was conjectured years ago from very different considerations @xcite .",
    "another relevant issue concern the _ spectral weight _",
    "@xmath258 of infinite random trees .",
    "this is the coefficient of the @xmath259 singularity of @xmath75 as @xmath21 , that is @xmath260 it is clear from equation and the auto ",
    "averaging property that the spectral weight is related to the scaling function @xmath157 by @xmath261 on the other hand it is known @xcite that on any given infinite graph with local spectral dimension @xmath262 , the local spectral weight does not really depend on @xmath49 , that is @xmath263 for any node @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , thanks to statistical homogeneity , it is clear that on a given tree @xmath264 , with @xmath265 a specific instance of a random variable distributed according to @xmath266 . since @xmath266 is not @xmath267like ( see previous section ) , we have in general @xmath268 , that is local and average spectral weights differ in general , unlike the spectral dimension .",
    "one might wonder then about the auto  averaging property , since @xmath269 does not fluctuate over the tree .",
    "of course the resolution of this apparent contradiction is in the order of limits : averaging over the infinite graph and small @xmath13 asymptotics of @xmath270 are operations that can not be commuted in general .",
    "these last remarks suggests a further development in the explicit calculation of the universal limit function @xmath266 .",
    "another interesting direction of research is in the construction of modified tree  generating algorithms such that scaling is preserved with @xmath255 , in order to check the general formula ( [ eq : general ] ) .",
    "we thank r. burioni and d. cassi for many valuable comments and suggestions .",
    "first of all let us write the explicit form of @xmath178 @xmath271 in the case without the non  extinction condition we will prove that @xmath272 first of all let us prove this equation when all @xmath273 ; the case @xmath274 is known from equation ( [ eq : v1n ] ) while for arbitrary @xmath275 is proved by induction ; in fact if @xmath276 is assumed for @xmath277 we have @xmath278 where all addends which consist of a product of three or more averages and the ones that come from lower powers of @xmath279 are negligible in the limit @xmath51 thanks to equation ( [ eq : v1pn ] ) , so that @xmath280 extending equation ( [ eq : v1pn ] ) from @xmath275 to @xmath281 .    now , let us prove equation ( [ eq : pvn ] ) by induction ; in this case the induction is on the quantity @xmath282 .",
    "let us denote with @xmath283 the greatest among @xmath284 ; we have @xmath285 where @xmath286 are all the possible ordered subsets of @xmath287 .",
    "now equation ( [ eq : pvn ] ) follows but a few remarks are needed .",
    "first , all terms in the right hand side involve averages whose value of n is smaller than the one in the left hand side",
    ". then all the terms that are not explicitly written are proportional to lower power of @xmath17 : some of them in fact consist in the product of three or more averages ( each of them carries a `` @xmath288 '' in the exponent ) , some other are expressions with more than @xmath281 factors @xmath232 , and finally some others come from products involving the @xmath289 .",
    "we turn now to the probability @xmath290 with non  extinction condition for which the recursions reads @xmath291 we will prove that @xmath292 some special cases , including @xmath293 have been already shown in section [ scaling ] , while the general case is proved by induction .",
    "in fact the recurrence for @xmath294 reads ( writing only leading order terms , as before ) @xmath295 with the same remarks as in the previous case .",
