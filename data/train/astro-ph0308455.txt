    "axps share all these features with soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgrs ) @xcite .",
    "the observation of bursts from axps @xcite , suggests a strong connection between axps and sgrs .    in magnetar models",
    "@xcite bursts are triggered and powered by enormous magnetic fields , @xmath6 gauss , and the energy source of the x - ray emission is the decay of this magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the star spins down by magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "while the magnetar model is quite successful in modelling the sgr and axp bursts , and spin - down rates , it can not explain the period clustering @xcite except in one set of field decay models under special conditions @xcite .",
    "accretion models for axps started with the work of @xcite .",
    "the current models invoke neutron stars with @xmath7 g and explain the period clustering in terms of asymptotic evolution of the neutron star rotation rate towards equilibrium with a fall - back disk ( chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 , hereafter chn ; alpar 2001 ; marsden , lingenfelter & rothschild 2001 ) .",
    "these models require no binary companion .",
    "axp ages are indicated by the ages of the supernova remnants associated with some axps .",
    "the possibility that some material in a supernova explosion might fall back and accrete onto the new - born neutron star has been explored by several authors @xcite .",
    "fall - back accretion disks have been invoked to address a diversity of astrophysical problems @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown , by using smoothed particle hydrodynamics @xcite , that an accretion disk is formed around a new - born compact object if the progenitor had been rotating before the explosion .",
    "the total mass of the fall - back gas has been estimated to be @xmath8 by @xcite , @xmath9 by @xcite and @xmath10 by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the angular momentum carried by the neutron star and by the ambient material must play an important role in determining the subsequent evolution .",
    "motivated by the recognition of angular momentum as an important initial parameter , @xcite proposed a classification of young neutron stars in terms of the absence or presence and properties of a fall - back disk .",
    "according to this model axps , sgrs and dim thermal neutron stars ( dtns ) have similar periods because they are in an asymptotic spin - down phase in interaction with a fall - back disk .",
    "the different classes represent alternative pathways of neutron stars .",
    "radio pulsars have no disks or encounter very low mass inflow rates while radio quiet neutron stars ( rqns ) have such high mass inflow rates that their pulse periods are obscured by the dense medium around .",
    "axps and sgrs evolve through a propeller stage @xcite in which the rapid rotation of the neutron star prevents the inflowing matter from accreting onto the surface of the star and the star is spun - down until its rotation is slow enough that accretion can commence .",
    "chn pioneered a specific evolutionary model to produce axps with a fall - back disk .",
    "they employed the available time - dependent viscous thin disk models .",
    "there are upper limits and observations in the infrared and optical that have been evaluated within the chn thin disk model to constrain and argue against the fall - back disk models in general .",
    "two points should be underlined here .",
    "first , the recent detections in the infrared ( and optical ) supports the existence of a disk @xcite .",
    "the magnetar models do not have a prediction for magnetospheric production of infrared photons , and the detections in ir are well in excess of the extrapolation of a neutron star surface black - body fit to the x - ray band .",
    "the second point is that if a disk is present , it is unlikely that it will be a thin disk in a stable state , as the sources are expected to spend significant parts of their evolution in a propeller phase in which mass that can not be accreted to the neutron star will remain bound around the star and disk . in addition , there will be irradiation effects on the disk .",
    "the thin disk models are probably not the realistic models to compare with the data .",
    "nevertheless , as the only available working models , they warrant a careful study to decide whether interaction with a fall - back disk can lead to axp periods and luminosities at the ages indicated by snr - axp associations . on the other hand optical pulsations with a large pulse fraction observed from @xcite can not be explained by emission or reprocessing from a disk .",
    "this observation , in addition to its successful application to model sgr and axp bursts , clearly favors magnetar models , while the period clustering has a natural explanation in disk models . it may be the case that the axps ( which show bursts like sgrs ) do have surface magnetic fields in the higher multipoles and a dipole field in the @xmath11 g range interacting with a fall - back disk to provide the rotational equilibrium that leads to period clustering .",
    "such a hybrid model in which axps and sgrs would be the rare objects that correspond to the high magnetic field _ and _ high angular momentum ( fall - back disk ) corner of the parameter space of initial conditions , makes the actual possibilities of disk models worth exploring .",
    "an investigation of the chn model was carried out by @xcite who argued that with the bound - free opacities that are relevant , the evolution would not lead to axps .",
    "this work was carried out with a disk solution with inner boundary condition relevant for a disk losing mass by accretion whereas the system throughout its evolution is in the propeller regime .",
    "we employ different thin - disk solutions for propeller and for accretor phases of the evolution , use electron scattering and bound - free ( mostly the latter ) opacities as appropriate and include a range of initial disk masses . in the next section we present the model equations , the special analytical solutions , and their relation to the numerical calculations for a finite disk .",
    "results are presented in section 3 , and discussed in the final section .",
    "the evolution of a viscous thin disk is governed by a non - linear diffusion equation @xcite which accepts three self - similar solutions @xcite extending down to @xmath12 , if the disk opacity has a power - law dependence on density and temperature .",
    "one of these solutions is a simple power - law both in spatial and temporal variables and is irrelevant for fall - back disks which have freely expanding outer boundaries .",
    "the other two solutions can be associated with accretion and propeller regimes . in the solution which we associate with the accretion regime @xcite",
    "the total angular momentum of the disk is constant ( @xmath13 ) and mass of the disk decreases in time such that @xmath14 .",
    "this is the solution employed by chn for all phases of axp evolution . in the other solution which we associate with the propeller regime , the mass of the disk is constant ( @xmath15 ) and angular momentum of the disk increases in time by the viscous torque at the inner radius such that @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite mentioned that `` such a solution might represent a disc around a magnetized star which is rotating sufficiently rapidly that its angular velocity exceeds the keplerian velocity at the magnetosphere '' - i.e. a propeller .",
    "a real disk starts at an inner radius @xmath17 determined by the magnetic moment @xmath18 and rotation rate @xmath19 of the neutron star , and mass flow rate @xmath20 .",
    "for both types of analytical solutions extending to @xmath12 , the application to a real disk with finite inner radius @xmath17 requires a numerical treatment , which shows that the accretor solution @xcite and the propeller solution @xcite are good representations of the numerical solutions , the initial conditions being ` forgotten ' after a brief transition period .",
    "one dimensional thin disk solutions necessarily suppress the two dimensional mass flow in the @xmath21 plane of a realistic disk model . in the case of accretor type analytical solutions , the mass flow @xmath20 is inward in the inner disk . in the propeller type",
    "analytical solutions @xmath20 is outward , with the mass loss rate of the disk @xmath22 .",

    ", thin disk equations @xcite can be solved to yield the power law indices of the time dependence in the two analytical solutions : @xmath24 for the accretor type solution @xcite ; and @xmath25 for the solution we associate with propeller regime @xcite . for electron scattering dominated disks ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and for bound - free opacity dominated disks ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "chn used @xmath33 for analytical convenience .",
    "the total torque is the sum of accretion torque @xmath34 and the viscous torque @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the vertically averaged viscous stress .",
    "the accretor solution is not precisely the time - dependent version of the @xcite solutions with the same inner boundary condition .",
    "the latter solutions assume vanishing _ viscous torque _ whereas the time - dependent solution implies vanishing _ total torque _ at the inner boundary .",
    "the inner boundary of the disk , @xmath17 , is where the ram pressure @xmath37 of the disk is balanced by the magnetic pressure @xmath38 . assuming a dipole field for the neutron star , the magnetic pressure can be written as @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the light cylinder radius and @xmath18 is the dipole magnetic moment .",
    "we write the ram pressure as@xmath41 ( see @xcite ) where @xmath42 is the corotation radius and @xmath43 is the mass flow rate . here",
    "@xmath44 denotes the keplerian rotation rate at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the two expressions we adopt for @xmath45 are asymptotic forms for @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fastness parameter .    when the flow rate at @xmath17 is greater than the critical rate @xmath49 , we follow @xcite and assume that the disk inside the `` spherization '' radius @xmath50 regulates itself as @xmath51 with the result that the total luminosity of the disk does not exceed the eddington limit considerably @xcite .",
    "these considerations are relevant for the earliest stages of the mass flow typically extending over @xmath52 years in our calculations and do not effect the later period evolution of the star significantly . however , without such an incorporation of radiation pressure , the initial inner radius of the disk is obtained to be smaller than the radius of the neutron star , which is unphysical , and the system passes through an accretor stage . with the implementation of radiation pressure effects , the initial inner radius of the disk is greater than the corotation radius and the system is in a supercritical propeller stage . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "the inner radius @xmath53 is determined self - consistently at each time step using equations ( [ pmag ] ) , ( [ pram ] ) and ( [ regulate ] ) .",
    "the accretor solution with the boundary condition @xmath13 had been applied for fall - back disks by @xcite , and chn .",
    "starting from the early phases , throughout most or all of its evolution into the asymptotic `` tracking '' axp phase , the disk is in the propeller regime .",
    "we employ the relevant propeller type disk solution .",
    "this follows the power - law solution for @xmath54 given in eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) . in these propeller solutions at the inner boundary @xmath55",
    "while in the accretion regime @xmath56 .",
    "we shall define a representative value @xmath43 of the mass flow rate in the inner disk from the propeller torque @xmath54 translating the torque @xmath57 to a flow rate such that @xmath58 this yields a representative mass flow rate @xmath59 , defining the effective index @xmath60 .",
    "we emphasize that this definition is an estimate of the mass flow rates within the disk while the disk mass remains constant , with no mass loss from boundary . by employing the solution with a constant disk mass",
    ", we implicitly assume that the inflowing matter flung away by the magnetosphere of the neutron star returns back to the disk somewhere away from the inner boundary of the disk .",
    "the critical fastness parameter for transition from propeller to accretor regime is assumed to be @xmath61 and we take it to be 1 in all numerical experiments .",
    "the fastness parameter at which the torque vanishes is the equilibrium fastness parameter @xmath62 and is inferred to be somewhat smaller than @xmath63 as there are systems , like axps in our model , which are spinning down while accreting .",
    "we have observed numerically that the results do not depend sensitively on the value of @xmath62 and we take it to be @xmath64 .",
    "the range @xmath65 is not well interpreted with either the propeller or the accretor type of disk solutions , so when the fastness parameter @xmath66 has decayed to @xmath67 , we try two alternatives : ( i ) switching to the accretor solution ( arguing @xmath68 ) , ( ii ) continuing with the propeller solution ( arguing @xmath69 ) . in both cases",
    "we assume that a small fraction @xmath70 of the mass flow at the magnetic radius can reach the surface of the neutron star in order that @xmath71 gives the axp luminosities .",
    "@xcite showed that the disk is electron scattering dominated only in the initial stages when @xmath72^{-7/10}b_{12}^{3/5}$ ] , while later on , at lower mass flow rates , bound - free opacity dominates . here @xmath73 g s@xmath4 , @xmath74 gauss , @xmath75 is the hydrogen mass fraction and @xmath76 is the heavy element mass fraction . assuming the disk to be rich in heavy elements , we choose @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the flow rate in the propeller solution declines with a softer power - law index than it does in the accretion solution because in the former case matter can not accrete and the decrease in the flow rate is only by the viscous spreading of the disk .",
    "we incorporate the torque model used by @xcite in the form @xmath79 as noted by @xcite and @xcite , this is a very efficient propeller torque model compared to some other available propeller torques obtained through simple energy or angular momentum arguments .",
    "this form of the torque is supported by the detailed numerical simulations of the magnetic boundary layers investigated by @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite revived the propeller model of @xcite which incorporates a still more efficient torque @xmath80 for the sub - sonic propeller , and a torque @xmath81 , which agrees with our model in the large @xmath82 limit , for the super - sonic propeller regime .",
    "these models do not entail asymptotic approach to rotational equilibrium , and are therefore not relevant for addressing the period clustering of axps .",
    "the recent numerical work of @xcite also indicate an efficient propeller torque ( @xmath83 ) . for @xmath84 matter",
    "can be flung away with the tangential velocity of the field lines at @xmath85 which is greater than the escape velocity so that some mass loss will take place in disagreement with the propeller type solution we employ .",
    "this means that the remaining mass of the disk , when the system reaches @xmath86 and accretion onto the neutron star is allowed , is actually lower than what we find by assuming the mass of the disk is conserved .",
    "in this case the factor @xmath70 need not be very low but can attain a reasonable value .    the initial mass of the disk can be found by integrating the mass flow rate after accretion starts .",
    "this yields @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the transition time from propeller to the accretor regime and @xmath89 is the inflow rate at @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . by fitting to the numerical solutions we have determined , for an initial mass flow rate of @xmath92 g s@xmath4 , that @xmath93 g s@xmath4 and @xmath94 years which means that @xmath95",
    "this nominal value of the initial disk mass is 50 times smaller than the nominal value incorporated in the chn model . from our fits",
    "we find that the initial inflow rate and the initial mass of the disk are related through @xmath96 for our parameter range .",
    "we have followed the evolution of the star - disk system for @xmath97 years , solving the torque equation ( [ torque ] ) numerically with the adaptive step - size runge - kutta method @xcite .",
    "we assumed the radius and mass of the neutron star to be @xmath98 cm and @xmath99 , respectively . in all numerical experiments",
    "we have fixed the initial period @xmath100 ms , and considered dipole magnetic moments in the range @xmath101 .",
    "electron scattering opacity prevails in the disk at the high initial flow rates .",
    "the system is initially in the super - critical propeller stage ( i.e. radiation pressure is dominant ) .",
    "to follow one example , for an initial mass flow rate @xmath92 g s@xmath4 which corresponds to an initial disk mass of @xmath102 and the inner radius is at @xmath103 .",
    "the dynamical time - scale @xmath104 at this radius is @xmath105 s. for @xmath106 the supercritical propeller stage lasts for @xmath107 years . in this stage",
    "the effective power law index , @xmath108 is equal to @xmath109 , because the disk inner radius does not depend on @xmath110 in the super - critical regime , so that @xmath111 ( see eq .",
    "( [ translate ] ) ) .",
    "after @xmath107 years radiation pressure ceases to be important .",
    "electron scattering continues as the dominant opacity until @xmath112 years ; in this stage the effective power law index is @xmath113 .",
    "after @xmath112 years , the propeller regime continues with bound - free opacity dominating in the disk ; the effective power law index is now @xmath114 and remains so as long as the propeller regime continues . at around @xmath115 years",
    "the fastness parameter drops below @xmath116 and the system enters the `` tracking phase '' chn .",
    "it is during this period that we observe the system as an axp .    in figure",
    "[ periods ] we give the period evolution of a neutron star for these parameters .",
    "these are the typical values leading to axps and sgrs .",
    "panel ( a ) corresponds to the case in which we switched to the accretor type of solution when the fastness parameter decayed below @xmath63 and panel ( b ) correspond to the case in which we continued with the propeller solution .",
    "we see that the latter case yields a somewhat more gradual period evolution because the equilibrium period increases less rapidly in this case .",
    "figure [ ppdots ] shows the evolutionary tracks in the @xmath117 diagram .",
    "again the two panels ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the two cases as described for figure [ periods ] .",
    "we see that the fall - back disk model can account for the position of axps and sgrs in the @xmath117 diagram . in both cases",
    "the observed axp luminosities require that the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star , @xmath118 , is only a fraction @xmath119 of the mass accretion rate in the disk . whether the accreted fraction can be this low when the system is asymptotically close to equilibrium is an open question .",
    "the soft x - ray transient aql x-1 may have exhibited a comparably small accreted fraction of its mass transfer rate when it went through a reduction in luminosity by @xmath120 , interpreted as a transition to the propeller state @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the small value of @xmath121 implied by the present model calculations may reflect our assumption that the mass flow of the disk remains constant throughout the propeller phase : in reality some matter should have been expelled from the system which would lead to lower mass flow rates in the present day disk and hence the actual accreted fraction @xmath121 , to meet the observed luminosities , could be higher . in any case models for an estimation of @xmath121 on the basis of accretion or propeller dynamics are not available at present ( see @xcite for a numerical approach ) .",
    "the result @xmath122 is an empirical constraint on fall - back disk models if they are to explain the observed luminosities of axps .",
    "any independent evidence on the value of @xmath121 in these or similar sources will provide a test of the presently employed fall - back disk model .",
    "our results do not change qualitatively for initial disk masses @xmath123 .",
    "the transition to the accretion stage becomes earlier for greater initial disk masses . for @xmath124 and @xmath125 ,",
    "the transition to the accretion regime occurs at 3000 years and for higher initial disk masses we obtain mass inflow rates as high as @xmath126 g s@xmath4 which give @xmath127 to obtain present day luminosities of axps . for @xmath128",
    "the magnetic radius exceeds the light cylinder radius @xmath129 at an early stage and the source becomes a radio pulsar .",
    "the fact that the model gives radio pulsars at initial disk masses just below the range leading to axps and sgrs supports a continuity between axps , sgrs and radio pulsars , and suggests that radio pulsars might also have disks around them .",
    "we shall explore in a separate paper the possibilities of this continuity in initial conditions for different classes of neutron stars , in particular evolutionary tracks leading to axps , sgrs _ and _ radio pulsars in the same region of the @xmath117 diagram as the axps @xcite .",
    "thin disk models yield axps only if an efficient torque model is used as noted by @xcite and @xcite . our simulations with other torque models @xcite",
    "show that these do not produce axps , verifying the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , as noted in the previous section , recent analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite studies lend support to an efficient torque model .",
    "the question naturally arises as to why the disk evolution does not continue , to give sources with @xmath130 s ; what is the justification for assuming that disk evolution stops at a finite age ( @xmath131 yrs in the present work ) ?",
    "the formal power - law solutions predict disk masses / torques decaying to infinitely small values as @xmath132 . in reality at low density and temperature",
    "the disk undergoes a transition to a neutral state , stopping its viscous evolution .",
    "instabilities are likely to clump and destroy the disk eventually . as estimated by @xcite fall - back disks",
    "become neutralized at around @xmath133 years . in our models ,",
    "the slower decrease in disk density and temperature leads to neutrality at around @xmath134 years .",
    "chn gave an explanation for the upper cutoff of the spin period in terms of the transition from a thin disk to an advection dominated accretion flow with mass loss .",
    "our results show that for thin disks with bound - free opacities prevailing most of the time and with a range of initial disk masses ( @xmath135 ) and neutron star _ dipole _ magnetic moments ( @xmath136 ) neutron stars do end up in the period range @xmath137 s at ages @xmath138 years .",
    "the model we introduced yields present day disks that are consistent with the infrared observations for axps and sgrs ( see , eg .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , as we shall detail in a subsequent paper .",
    "the observed luminosities require that only a fraction of the mass flow rate is accreted onto the neutron star in the current asymptotic phase .",
    "the radial @xcite and temporal @xcite properties of propeller disks are different from the properties of disks in the mass - loss `` accretion '' regime . the flow rate in the accretor solutions for the disk decreases steeply both by losing mass due to accretion and by the viscous spreading of the disk , whereas in the propeller solutions it is only the `` thinning '' of the disk by viscous spread that decreases the flow rate , while the disk mass remains constant .",
    "it is possible that a fall - back disk loses mass also in the propeller regime because of the propeller effect itself , depending on the fastness parameter .",
    "the simple power - law models for the flow rate are working models which do not take into account the coupling of the star to the structure of the disk .",
    "as shown by @xcite whether one obtains an axp or not depends sensitively on the power - law index @xmath139 . extending the analysis to disk evolution in the propeller regime provides favorable effective power - law indices @xmath140 .",
    "we conclude that fall - back disks may well lead to the present day properties of axps and sgrs , even in the available thin disk models within the options of simple power law solutions .",
    "a more realistic treatment would include effects of the magnetic field on disk evolution , realistic opacities , including the iron line opacity @xcite for the fall - back disk which is rich in heavy elements , and the dependence of the accretion rate itself on the conditions at the inner boundary of the disk , including the effects of the motion of the inner radius @xcite .",
    "all of these effects would result in time evolution of the disk that can not be described by simple power laws .",
    "taking account of the complexities of the real problem is not likely to produce qualitative disagreement with the evolutionary timescales and tracks in the @xmath117 diagram , as long as the torque is efficient .",
    "the fall - back disk models do not provide an explanation for the axp and sgr bursts or for the optical pulsations observed in @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are likely to originate with processes in the crust or magnetosphere of a neutron star with a strong magnetic field .",
    "we have shown that a fall - back disk around a neutron star provides a viable mechanism to get the observed period range at the axp ages , provided that a fraction @xmath122 of the mass flow is accreted . applying this model in conjunction with magnetar models for the bursts and optical pulsations",
    "requires that the magnetar fields on the surface of the neutron star are in higher multipoles .",
    "as we have shown , the observed spindown rates and history of the axps ( or sgrs ) are determined by disk torques rather than magnetic dipole models .",
    "such a hybrid model assumes that magnetospheric generation of optical pulsations around a neutron star with a surface dipole field of @xmath141 g and higher multipoles of @xmath142 g is possible in the presence of the fall - back disk .",
    "a demonstration of such a magnetospheric model is beyond the scope of the present paper , and is to be attempted in future work .",
    "we finally note that the extended quiet ( low - noise ) spindown episodes of axps is compatible with the behavior of accreting sources , in that the same axps have had high - level noise characteristic of accreting sources ; and there are well known accreting sources like which exhibit similar extended quiet spindown @xcite .",
