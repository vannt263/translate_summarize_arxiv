    "recent advances in telescope instrumentation have provided an unprecedented view of the star formation process inside molecular clouds . near - infrared imaging from e.g.  _",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) captures the youngest stellar objects , whilst ( sub)millimetre continuum imaging with e.g.  scuba or mambo maps the very earliest stages of star formation , often before a well - defined central object is established ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "simulations of star formation have also become increasingly sophisticated ( e.g.  @xcite ) with the latest models including turbulence , magnetic fields and radiative transfer @xcite .",
    "the true , underlying structure in star - forming clouds , essential for comparison with models , is hard to disentangle from continuum images alone ( @xcite ; @xcite ) : density enhancements along the line of sight may superpose and limited spatial resolution and sensitivity inevitably blends nearby objects together .",
    "spectral lines from molecular species can provide crucial information about the _ kinematics _ of and physical conditions inside molecular clouds .",
    "they may for instance allow the separation of multiple objects , moving at distinct velocities , along a line of sight ( e.g.  @xcite ) . additionally , line emission is arguably the best discriminator between different support mechanisms for star - forming cores , i.e.  whether magnetic fields or turbulence dominate the required suppression of star formation in the bulk of clouds .",
    "this paper presents a new survey of the kinematics of star formation in the perseus molecular cloud .",
    "we observed four fields , totalling approximately 600arcmin@xmath4 in the @xmath0  rotational transition of @xmath1co , @xmath2co  and c@xmath3o  using harp ( heterodyne array receiver programme ) , a new array spectrograph operating between 325 and 375ghz on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt , see @xcite ) .",
    "these data represent some of the largest and highest - quality maps of the higher-@xmath9 transitions of co and its isotopologues with good angular resolution ( @xmath10arcsec ) .",
    "this paper is the first in a planned series which will examine the gas structure and core kinematics ( paper ii ) , molecular outflows ( paper iii ) and the physical conditions in the cloud cores ( paper iv ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the remainder of the introduction outlines the survey and its aims before sections [ sec : observations ] and [ sec : datareduction ] detail the observations and data reduction procedure including an algorithm to calibrate variable sensitivities across the harp array for molecular cloud data .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents maps of the integrated intensity of all of the isotopologues while some initial results including the cloud opacity and excitation temperature , assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) are presented in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we summarize this work in section [ sec : summary ] .      the transitions of co and its common isotopologues in the 345ghz atmospheric window trace denser and/or warmer regions than their lower @xmath9 relatives  compare the temperature of 5k and density of @xmath11@xmath12 required to collisionally excite the @xmath1co  @xmath13 line at 115ghz to table [ table : co_properties ] .",
    "these conditions are similar to those inside star - forming scuba cores , allowing us to probe the motions of bulk gas in their vicinity at matched resolution to scuba 850  observations .",
    "this survey is closely linked to the jcmt gould belt legacy survey ( gbs , @xcite ) .",
    "our data will eventually be included in that analysis and we share similar science goals , namely :    1",
    ".   map any high - velocity outflowing gas in the @xmath1co @xmath0  line to investigate mass - loss and accretion in a large sample of sources .",
    "the presence of an outflow can differentiate between a protostellar or starless continuum core , establishing the source age .",
    "establish the level of non - thermal support inside star - forming cores from the c@xmath3o  transition , which may also be used to evaluate the levels of co depletion .",
    "3 .   investigate the turbulent structure of the molecular gas .",
    ".the transitions of co and its isotopologues observed .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table:12cot_cores ]    we can make an interesting comparison between this gas temperature and that of the dust . at high densities , @xmath14@xmath12 , conditions likely to be probed in co with harp , the gas and dust temperatures are coupled @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite computed the dust temperature at 40arcsec resolution across perseus using _ spitzer _ and _ iras _ measurements .",
    "we plot @xmath15 degraded to 40arcsec resolution versus @xcite s dust temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig:12cot_scatter ] .",
    "the dust temperature , @xmath16 , was calculated from _ spitzer _ 70 and 160fluxes , which is dominated by warm dust along the line of sight rather than",
    "the denser , colder material in say starless cores and is more likely to match the material traced in @xmath1co .",
    "there is actually little correlation between the two temperatures .",
    "typically @xmath16 is slightly lower than @xmath15 : 1220k compared to 830k . in ngc1333 and ic348 , @xmath15 is mostly larger than @xmath16 although there is a significant proportion of pixels where the opposite is true .",
    "however , in l1448 and l1455 , nearly everywhere @xmath17 .",
    "this may be explained if the @xmath1co  gas is not tracing the same areas as the dust emission , with the @xmath1co  emitted in a colder layer whilst the dust comes from a hotter inner cloud region .",
    "additionally , if the gas is not optically thick , then we would over - estimate the @xmath1coexcitation temperature and @xmath18 .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the @xmath1co  excitation temperature may be correlated with the cloud column density .",
    "as the rotational transition is collisionally excited , on moving to denser and higher extinction portions of the cloud with densities above the critical density , the gas @xmath15 should increase .",
    "we use the integrated c@xmath3o  @xmath0  intensity as a proxy for the visual extinction since typically there is a linear relation between them . using c@xmath3o  @xmath13  data across the perseus molecular cloud @xcite measured : @xmath20 in fig .",
    "[ fig:12cot_scatter ] , we plot the c@xmath3o  integrated intensity , @xmath21 versus @xmath15 , with lines denoting the expected variation for various column densities of c@xmath3o  assuming lte . no single line is a good fit for all the points as in each region there is a range of column densities .",
    "however , a moderate range of column densities will span the whole parameter space . at low temperatures with a good deal of scatter the integrated intensity increases linearly with @xmath15 .",
    "l1448 again requires the highest column densities with ic348 and ngc1333 having a large spread in conditions .",
    "this paper presents the technical details and preliminary analysis of a large - scale survey of the kinematics of molecular gas in the perseus molecular cloud .",
    "observations of the @xmath0  rotational transitions of @xmath1co , @xmath2co  and c@xmath3o  in over 600arcmin@xmath4 of ngc1333 , ic348 , l1448 and l1455 were undertaken with harp on the jcmt .",
    "we introduce a new ` flatfield ' procedure to account for striping artefacts in harp scan maps of molecular clouds , apparently resulting from differential performance across the detectors and/or their samplers .",
    "the data from each working detector is multiplied by a conversion factor which scales its intensity to match the nominated reference detector .",
    "the factors are computed from the scientific observations themselves by calculating the total intensity received by each detector across the whole map .",
    "we compare integrated intensity maps of the three tracers to scuba 850  emission @xcite and the position of protostars and starless cores @xcite in each field .",
    "there is a striking similarity between the scuba maps and c@xmath3o  emission , hinting that similar densities of material are traced with the gas and dust strongly coupled .",
    "however , the detailed structure of individual star - forming cores is not always so simple , for example very bright scuba cores sometimes have only weak c@xmath3o emission and vice versa .",
    "many outflows are obvious in the @xmath1co  data , which we will examine in detail in a subsequent study ( curtis et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the @xmath2co  maps are somewhat intermediate between the other two isotopologues and average spectra across the maps do show weak linewings from outflows .",
    "intriguingly , masses derived from the harp and scuba data exhibit different trends across the four regions , emphasizing the need to examine the detailed excitation conditions across regions rather than simple constant assumptions .    from the @xmath2co / c@xmath3o  integrated line ratio , @xmath22 , we explore variations in the gas opacity and estimate the two species relative abundance ( @xmath5/[c^{18}o]}\\sim 7 $ ] ) .",
    "across most of the regions the c@xmath3o  gas is optically thin ( @xmath23 ) and therefore is a reliable total mass tracer . indeed ,",
    "inside the denser parts of the clouds , the star - forming cores , the opacity does not increase beyond a maximum , @xmath24 .",
    "when we also consider that the critical density of the transition is some @xmath25@xmath12 , we expect to probe an intermediate region between a dense core and its envelope with the c@xmath3o  line .",
    "the @xmath2co  optical depths are neither in the optically thin nor thick regimes ( @xmath26 is typically 0.151.52 ) .",
    "class 0 protostars have smaller ratios than class is as expected as more material accretes on to the central object over time .",
    "if we assume the @xmath1co  line is optically thick , an estimate of the excitation temperature can be gathered from the peak line temperature , assuming lte ( in which case @xmath8 is the physical gas temperature ) . in general",
    "we derive temperature of 525k , increasing towards the centres of the individual regions and in outflow lobes .",
    "an area in the northwest of ngc1333 has temperatures of over 45k , probably as it is heated by a uv source and/or the region has lower density so is not optically thick . ic348 and ngc1333 are on average much warmer than l1448 and l1455 .",
    "this is partly as the averages for ngc1333 are skewed upwards because of the warm gas in the north and perhaps since ngc1333 and ic348 are closer to 40 per ( thought to be triggering star formation in perseus ) .",
    "there is little correlation between @xmath8 and the dust temperature , @xmath27 , derived from _",
    "observations @xcite . typically @xmath27 is slightly lower than @xmath8 : 1220k compared to 830k .",
    "however , in l1448 and l1445 , typically @xmath28 , this may imply we are tracing completely different regions with the @xmath1co  gas and warm dust or that the gas is not optically thick , so we are over - estimating @xmath8 .",
    "this work demonstrates the utility of harp for large - scale surveys of gas kinematics in nearby molecular clouds .",
    "the @xmath0  transitions of co and its isotopologues are powerful probes of the conditions of star formation when used in combination , examining moderately high densities comparable to the dust densities seen by scuba .",
