    "despite its nearly a hundred - year - old age , einstein gravity continues to be a source of inspirations and surprises . besides the great success in describing physics in solar system ,",
    "einstein gravity also predicts existence of various black holes and even extended objects like black strings @xcite and black rings @xcite in higher dimensions .",
    "not all aspects of these nontrivial solutions have been fully understood . even in the pure vacuum sector",
    ", einstein gravity has been shown to possess an unexpected richness ",
    "in addition to the well known maximally symmetric vacua ( ds , ads , minkowski etc ) , einstein gravity also admits inhomogeneous vacua such as the anisotropic accelerating vacua @xcite and the massless topological black hole vacua @xcite and so on . in this article , we shall present a novel class of einstein vacua which possess accelerating horizons of nontrivial topology . concretely",
    ", the vacua we shall be discussing are accelerating vacua with horizons being conformally distorted sphere bundles over @xmath1 .",
    "after euclideanization , the whole vacuum metric becomes that of a conformally distorted sphere bundle over @xmath1 , which corresponds to a smooth , compact and inhomogeneous riemannian manifold .",
    "historically , the first known smooth , compact and inhomogeneous riemannian manifold of constant scalar curvature was the gravitational instanton discovered by don page @xcite .",
    "page s gravitational instanton describes a nontrivial metric of @xmath4 bundle over @xmath4 .",
    "such metrics were later generalized to higher dimensions @xcite , giving rise to constant curvature metrics of nontrivial @xmath5 bundle over @xmath4 . in differential",
    "geometry , sphere bundles over @xmath1 are more complicated than sphere bundles over @xmath4 , because the latter are simply connected and are known to be einstein manifolds , while the former are non - simply connected and are not einstein manifolds .",
    "the present work shows that , although @xmath2 bundles over @xmath1 are in general not einstein , there exists an einstein metric in the conformal class of such manifolds .",
    "we begin our study by presenting a novel einstein vacuum solution in five dimensions ( 5d ) .",
    "we start from 5d not because 5d is of any particular importance for the construction , but because we began studying this subject with the aim of finding black rings with cosmological constant .",
    "though we have not yet fulfilled our aim , the result presented here indeed bears some resemblance to black ring solutions , with the exception that instead of black ring horizon of topology @xmath6 , we now have a cosmological horizon of the same topology .",
    "the metric of the novel vacuum solution is given as follows , @xmath7 , \\label{5dm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 this metric is a generalized version of a 4-dimensional metric found in @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this metric is an exact solution to the vacuum einstein equation with a cosmological constant given by @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , this is an inhomogeneous de sitter spacetime with no singularities . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the metric is still free of essential singularities , but the cosmological constant becomes negative , and there exist apparent singularities in the conformal factor which indicates non - compactness of the spacetime in this case . in the rest of this article , we assume @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath13 .    the singularity free nature of the metric is best manifested by the calculation of curvature invariants . for instances",
    ", we have @xmath14    physically , the metric describes an accelerating vacuum of einstein gravity with the accelerating horizon taking a nontrivial topology .",
    "the proper acceleration @xmath15 for the static observers in the spacetime has the norm @xmath16 this quantity has the finite value @xmath17 at @xmath18 and blows up to infinity at @xmath19 .",
    "so the @xmath20 hyper surface represents an accelerating horizon .",
    "notice that the coordinate @xmath21 is not the radial variable in polar coordinate system , @xmath18 corresponds not to the spacial origin but to a circle of radius @xmath22 .",
    "thus , unlike the usual de sitter spacetime , the acceleration horizon is a topologically nontrivial manifold .",
    "to understand the nontrivial topology of the acceleration horizon , we now look at the metric on the horizon surface .",
    "we have @xmath23 let us temporarily put the conformal factor aside .",
    "the 3d hyper surface with the metric @xmath24 has a very nice geometric interpretation .",
    "let us follow the treatment of @xcite of this geometry .",
    "consider a global embedding of a 3d hypersurface @xmath25 into 4d euclidean space @xmath26 .",

    "we can make the correspondence of the line element ( [ dst ] ) with the 3d hyper surface ( [ hs ] ) even more direct . to do this ,",
    "we simply parametrize the 3-surface as @xmath35 in fact , the hypersurface equation ( [ hs ] ) describes an @xmath36 fibration over @xmath3 , with the circle @xmath3 parametrized by the angle @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the horizon surface is nothing but a conformally distorted @xmath36 bundle over @xmath3 .",
    "note that the hypersurface ( [ hs ] ) is not of constant scalar curvature .      to understand how seriously the conformal factor distorts the geometry of @xmath36 fibration over @xmath3",
    ", we need to study the behavior of the conformal factor . for any fixed @xmath38 ( which is the case when we study the horizon geometry ) , the square root of the conformal factor , @xmath39 ,",
    "sweeps an ellipse if @xmath40 , a parabola if @xmath41 or a pair of hyperbola if @xmath42 . the value of @xmath43 corresponds to the eccentricity of these conics .",
    "since we shall be mainly interested in compact surfaces , we assume @xmath40 . under this condition , if the part of the horizon surface besides the conformal factor were a round sphere , then the effect of the conformal factor will simply be squashing the sphere into an ellipsoid @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "however , the part of the horizon surface besides the conformal factor is an @xmath36 bundle over @xmath3 , so the full horizon surface is a conformally squashed @xmath36 bundle over @xmath3 .      to make thorough understanding of the structure of the metric ( [ 5 dm ] ) , we now study its causal structure .",
    "first , we introduce the eddington - finkelstein coordinates , @xmath44 where the tortoise coordinate @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 and both @xmath47 and @xmath48 belong to the range @xmath49 . in this coordinate system , the metric ( [ 5 dm ] ) becomes @xmath50 , \\label{metric3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the line element on the angular surface , whose geometry is very similar to that of the line element ( [ dst ] ) which represents an @xmath36 bundle over @xmath3 as mentioned in subsection [ hg ] .",
    "the kruskal coordinates are introduced as @xmath53 where the signs of @xmath54 and @xmath55 coincide if @xmath56 , and are opposite to each other if @xmath57 .",
    "so there are totally 4 different combinations , each of which corresponds to a causal patch in the conformal diagrams to be drawn below . in each cases",
    ", one finds that @xmath58 and eq.([metric3 ] ) becomes @xmath59,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath60 are to be regarded as functions of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath61 finally , the carter - penrose coordinates can be introduced by the usual arctangent mappings of @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath62 in terms of which the metric becomes @xmath63.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the values of the product @xmath64 at @xmath18 ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 are respectively @xmath70 the curves corresponding to @xmath18 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be easily depicted on the @xmath71 plane and they form various boundaries in the carter - penrose diagrams . however , from ( [ rho ] ) , it follows that @xmath69 will never be reachable if @xmath72 .",
    "so , only for @xmath73 , the @xmath69 curves on the @xmath71 plane can possibly play as boundaries in the carter - penrose diagram .",
    "when this the case , these curves will separate our spacetime into two patches : the ( + ) patch with @xmath74 and the @xmath75 patch with @xmath76 . below",
    "we shall consider 3 different sub cases in detail .",

    "* @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . in this case",

    "moreover , the @xmath85 and the @xmath86 curves coincide on the @xmath71 plane , which separate the spacetime into ( + ) and @xmath75 patches .",
    "it can be easily inferred from above that @xmath87 and its value is varying with @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding carter - penrose diagram is depicted in fig.[fig1 ] ( c ) , in which the shaded areas correspond to the @xmath75 patch , while the unshaded area corresponds to the ( + ) patch .",
    "the variable @xmath60 is discontinuous in this case : it takes values in @xmath89 in the ( + ) patch and in @xmath90 $ ] in the @xmath75 patch .",
    "the metric depends on two parameters @xmath91 and @xmath22 , which can be chosen to take various limits .",
    "the first limit we can consider is taking @xmath92 while keeping @xmath22 finite . in this limit , both the conformal factor and the function @xmath93 goes to unity and the metric becomes @xmath94 which describes a ricci flat spacetime .",
    "the spacial slices of the spacetime are nothing but a trivial fibration of @xmath95 over @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding spacetime has vanishing proper accelerations for any static observer and there is no acceleration horizon . if , at this point , we require further @xmath96 , then the line element becomes that of the 5d minkowski spacetime , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the metric of @xmath99 written in the standard hopf coordinates .",
    "it is amazing that the presence of the acceleration parameter produces both the horizon and its nontrivial topology .",
    "the next limit we can consider is a double scaling limit @xmath100 whilst @xmath101 is kept finite . in this limit , the spacetime becomes the standard spherically symmetric de sitter spacetime ds@xmath102 with radius @xmath103 .",
    "notice that we can not take the limit @xmath96 while keeping @xmath91 finite , because in that case the function @xmath104 becomes undefined .",
    "the third limit we can consider can be achieved by an overall rescaling of the metric . let us make a rescaling @xmath105 , @xmath106 , so that the resulting metric becomes @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 notice that the cosmological constant can be expressed in terms of @xmath110 and @xmath111 as @xmath112 so we have @xmath113 for de sitter case , @xmath114 for flat case and @xmath115 for ads case .",
    "we can drop the overall constant factor @xmath110 in the line element , which just results in a rescaling of the cosmological constant .",
    "the resulting metric will then depend only on a single parameter @xmath111 .",
    "we can further take the limit @xmath116 , in which case the metric becomes that of the standard 5d de sitter of unit radius .",
    "note that this limit can not be achieved if we had not made the rescaling of the metric before .",
    "euclideanization of einstein vacua is an important subject of study from both physics and mathematical perspectives .",
    "the physics motivation for studying the euclideanized vacua is to study the vacuum transitions in euclidean quantum gravity .",
    "the known examples of @xcite and @xcite were found for this purpose .",
    "mathematically , euclideanized einstein metrics often gives explicit examples of smooth compact riemannian manifolds , which is an important class of manifold in differential geometry . in the following",

    "we put this extrinsic geometric description in the appendix . ] .",
    "the coordinate @xmath121 parametrizes the @xmath122 fiber , which can be regarded as a generalization of the standard hopf coordinates for @xmath99 .",
    "the ranges of these coordinates are given in ( [ range ] ) in the appendix .",
    "the conformal factor squashes the round @xmath117 fiber and makes the ricci scalar of the full space a constant . in other words",
    ", there is a constant scalar curvature manifold in the conformal class of @xmath117 fibration over @xmath3 .",
    "the study of conformal class of a given riemannian manifold is an important subject of study in differential geometry , because this subject is intimately related to the analysis of geometric flows .",
    "since the metric ( [ euc ] ) represents a conformally distorted @xmath117 fibration over @xmath3 , we shall refer to the corresponding geometry as a `` ring geometry '' , with the ring ( i.e. the @xmath3 factor ) parametrized by the angle @xmath37 .",
    "fibers of the ring geometry at a given @xmath37 is a conformal 4-sphere .",
    "the overall constant @xmath110 signifies the size of the ring surface , and the parameter @xmath111 represents the relative radius of the @xmath1 with respect to that of the @xmath122 .",
    "we have mentioned previously that when @xmath123 , the corresponding geometry is smooth , compact and inhomogeneous , with a positive constant scalar curvature .",
    "perhaps it is the first known example of such metrics on @xmath117 fibration over @xmath3 .",
    "the case @xmath124 corresponds to a degenerate case , i.e. a conformal @xmath125 .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate the volume of this compact space . without loss of generality , we set @xmath126 in the following calculations .",
    "we have , by direct calculation , @xmath127 using the coordinate range ( [ range ] ) , it is easy to evaluate the 5-volume of the space .",
    "the result is @xmath128 since the space is of constant scalar curvature , the corresponding einstein - hilbert action is proportional to the 5-volume , so its value is also zero .",
    "compact einstein metrics of zero volume are not rare .",
    "see @xcite for other examples .",
    "so far we have been restricting ourselves in five dimensions . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "5d is not of any particular importance in the construction .",
    "there is a higher dimensional cousin for the metric we studied in the previous sections .",
    "the dimensional metric can be written as @xmath129 where @xmath104 is as before , and @xmath130 is the line element of a round @xmath131-sphere .",
    "the associated cosmological constant is given by @xmath132 the physical and mathematical properties of this metric is extremely similar to the 5d case .",
    "for instance , the metric interpreted as einstein vacuum represents an accelerating vacuum in which the acceleration horizon has the topology of @xmath0 fibration over @xmath3 . the euclideanized version of the metric represents a conformally distorted metric on the full space of an @xmath2 fibration over @xmath3 and this metric is only compact for small value of @xmath111 , etc .    the euclideanized version of the higher dimensional metric is given as follows,@xmath133 this metric describes a conformally squashed @xmath2 fibration over @xmath1 .",
    "the cosmological constant can be written in terms of the parameters @xmath110 and @xmath111 as @xmath134    _ : _    the metric ( [ euc2 ] ) makes sense for all dimensions @xmath135 .",
    "we have already analyzed in detail the @xmath136 case . for @xmath137 , we just remove the @xmath138 term from the metric and recovers the metric given in @xcite . for @xmath139 , we remove the @xmath140 term altogether , and set @xmath141 everywhere else .",
    "we presented a novel class of accelerating einstein vacua with accelerating horizon bearing a nontrivial topology of @xmath0 bundle over @xmath1 .",
    "such solutions contain two parameters , one corresponds to the acceleration , the other corresponds to the relative radius of the @xmath1 base with respect to the @xmath0 fiber .",
    "there are various limiting cases for these parameters . among these",
    ", the zero acceleration limit corresponds to a ricci flat vacuum with no horizon .",
    "the double scaling limit gives rise to the standard de sitter vacua .",
    "upon euclideanization , the full space becomes a smooth compact inhomogeneous riemannian manifold with a positive constant scalar curvature .",
    "such euclidean manifolds can be regarded as analogues of page s gravitational instanton or its generalizations , but the topologies are now conformally distorted @xmath2 bundle over @xmath1 , rather than sphere bundles over @xmath4 .    since for generic values of the parameters , the vacua we obtained possess a positive cosmological constant and a ring - like acceleration horizon , we expect that such vacua should be the starting point to construct black rings with cosmological constant .",
    "asymptotically flat black ring solutions in einstein gravity were found over ten years ago , but so far no black ring solutions with cosmological constant were found .",
    "one of the major obstacle for constructing such solutions is the un - matching topologies : black ring solutions have horizons with @xmath6 topology , whilst the usual 5d de sitter spacetime has only an accelerating horizon of @xmath99 topology .",
    "the new vacua we found in this article do have the matching topology with black rings . to actually construct black rings",
    "which asymptote to our vacuum solutions , some complicated mathematical constructions are yet to be carried out .",
    "presumably the kerr - schild method which led to the discoveries of rotating black holes in higher dimensions with cosmological constants @xcite is a good starting point .",
    "we shall continue our explorations in this direction .",
