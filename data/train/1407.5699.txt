    "energy management ( or demand management ) is a technique that changes the electricity usage patterns of end users in response to the changes in the price of electricity over time  @xcite . with the advancement of distributed energy resources ( ders ) , the technique can also be used to assist the grid or other energy controllers such as a shared facility authority ( sfa )  @xcite to operate reliably and proficiently by supplying energy to them  @xcite .",
    "the majority of energy management literature focuses mainly on three different pricing schemes : time - of - use pricing ; day - ahead pricing ; and real - time pricing  @xcite .",
    "time - of - use pricing  @xcite has three different pricing rates : peak , off - peak and shoulder rate based on the use of electricity at different times of the day .",
    "day - ahead pricing  @xcite is , in principle , determined by matching offers from generators to bids from energy users ( eus ) so as to develop a classic supply and demand equilibrium price at an hourly interval .",
    "finally , real - time pricing  @xcite refers to tariffed retail charges for delivering electric power and energy that vary hour - to - hour , and are determined from wholesale market prices using an approved methodology .",
    "other popular dynamic pricing schemes include critical peak pricing , extreme day pricing , and extreme day critical peak pricing  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that in all of the above mentioned pricing schemes all eus are charged at the same rate at any particular time .",
    "due to government subsidies to encourage the use of renewables  @xcite , more eus with ders are expected to be available in smart grid .",
    "this will lead to a better completion of a purchasing target for an energy controller , and thus more saving from its buying cost .",
    "particularly , for energy controllers such as an sfa that relies on the main grid as its primary source of energy  @xcite , the opportunity for trading energy with eus can greatly reduce their dependency , and consequently decrease their cost of energy purchase  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , not all eus would be interested in trading energy with the energy controller if the benefit is not attractive  @xcite .",
    "this can precisely happen to eus with merely limited energy capacity , or to eus that are highly sensitive to the inconvenience caused by the trading of energy whose expected return could be very small . in this case , the eus would store the energy or change its consumption schedule rather than selling it to the energy controller  @xcite .",
    "however , one possible way to address this is to pay them a relatively higher price per unit of energy , compared to the eus with very large ders , without affecting their revenue significantly .",
    "in fact , allowing discriminate pricing not only considerably benefits eus with lower energy capacity without significantly affecting others , as we will see shortly , but also benefits the sfa by reducing its total cost of energy purchase when adopting this flexible pricing .",
    ".numerical example of a discriminate pricing scheme where an sfa requires @xmath0 kwh of energy from two eus and the sfa s total price per unit of energy to pay to the eus is @xmath0 cents / kwh . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table:2 ]    from table [ table:2 ] , first we note that the amount of energy that the sfa buys from the grid increases as the categories of eus change from case 1 to case 6 in the system .",
    "this is due to the fact that as the number of eus with higher sensitivity to inconvenience increases in the group , the total amount of power that the sfa can trade with eus becomes lower .",
    "hence , the sfa needs to procure the remainder of required energy from the grid at a higher price .",
    "secondly , the cost to the sfa to buy energy from eus with higher inconvenience parameters also increases its cost significantly as the sfa needs to pay a higher price to them .",
    "for example , consider the different cost that is incurred to the sfa for buying energy from different types of eus in case @xmath1 . from fig  [ fig : figure-6 ] , we can see that the amount of energy that the sfa buys from eus with @xmath2 is almost five times the amount it buys from eus with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , the resultant cost is only three times more than the cost to buy from eus with higher sensitivity .",
    "therefore , more eus with lower sensitivity to inconvenience allows the sfa to procure more energy at a comparatively lower cost .",
    "therefore , the total cost incurred by the sfa increases significantly with an increase in the number of eus with higher inconvenience parameters as can be seen from table [ table:2 ] .",
    "we also compare the total cost that is incurred to the sfa with the case when the sfa adopts an eds scheme for energy trading in table [ table:2 ] . in an eds scheme",
    ", the cost to the sfa remains the same for all type of eu groups as the cost does not depend on their categories . from table",
    "[ table:2 ] , the proposed scheme shows considerable benefit for the sfa in terms of reduction in total cost when there are a relatively higher number of eus with lower inconvenience parameters in the group .",
    "for example , as shown in table  [ table:2 ] , the cost reduction for the sfa is @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively for case 1 and 2 .",
    "according to the current case study , the average total cost reduction for the sfa is @xmath7 compared to the eds .",
    "however , the cost increases with the increase of number of eus with high inconvenience parameters , and becomes the same as the eds scheme when all the eus in the group become highly sensitive to the inconvenience of energy trading , i.e. , @xmath8 as can be seen from table [ table:2 ] .",
    "in this paper , a discriminate pricing scheme has been studied to counterbalance the inconvenience experienced by energy users ( eus ) with distributed energy resources ( ders ) in trading their energy with other entities in smart grids .",
    "a suitable cost function has been designed for a shared facility authority ( sfa ) that can effectively generate different prices per unit of energy to pay to each participating eu according to an inconvenience parameter for the eu . a two - stage stackelberg game ,",
    "which has been shown to have a unique sub - game perfect equilibrium , has been proposed to capture the energy trading between the sfa and different eus .",
    "the properties of the scheme have been studied at the equilibrium by using a backward induction technique .",
    "a theoretical price function has been derived for the sfa to decide on the price that it wants to pay to each eu , and the properties of the scheme are explained via numerical case studies . by comparing with an equal distribution scheme ( eds ) , it has been shown that discriminate pricing gives considerable benefit to the sfa in terms of reduction in total cost",
    ". one interesting future extension of the proposed scheme would be to design an algorithm that can capture the decision making process of the sfa and eus in a distributed fashion . also , finding a mathematical theorem that would explain the benefits to the sfa due to the discriminate pricing scheme is another possible extension of this work . finally , the design of a scheme ( i.e. , game ) with imperfect information about the inconvenience parameters also warrants future investigation .",
