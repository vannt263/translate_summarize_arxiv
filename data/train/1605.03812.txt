    "<S> superconducting electronic specific heat data is fitted reasonably well for an exponential relation with sommerfeld coefficient ( @xmath8 ) showing a linear relation with magnetic field suggesting that in re@xmath0hf dominant pairing channel is s - wave with isotropic superconducting gap parameter without nodes . </S>"
