    "cygnus x-3 is a well - known x - ray binary ( xrb ) located in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "its discovery dates back to 1966 @xcite but the nature of the system has remained a mystery despite extensive multiwavelength observations throughout the years .",
    "its x - ray @xcite show a very strong and infrared @xcite weaker 4.8-hour orbital modulation , typical of low - mass xrbs .",
    "however , infrared observations indicate that its mass - donating companion is a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star @xcite , which would make it a high - mass xrb . also unlike most other xrbs",
    ", cyg x-3 is relatively bright in the radio virtually all of the time and it undergoes giant radio outbursts with strong evidence of jet - like structures moving away at relativistic speeds @xcite .",
    "the distance to cyg x-3 is rather poorly constrained due to heavy absorption in the galactic plane totally obscuring the optical wavelengths . depending on the method , the distance to cyg x-3 is reported to be @xmath0 kpc @xcite , 8 kpc @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is quite possible that the accretion disc is enshrouded partially or wholly in the strong stellar wind of the wr companion ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of the compact object is not certain , but it is thought to be a black hole due to its spectral resemblance to other black hole xrb systems , such as grs 1915@xmath2105 and xte j1550@xmath3564 ( see e.g. @xcite , hereafter s08 ; @xcite ) .",
    "also there is no evidence of a neutron star system producing such massive radio outbursts ( up to 20 jy , @xcite ) as observed from cyg x-3 .",
    "cyg x-3 is a unique system in our galaxy , but recent observations of two xrbs in ic 10 @xcite and ngc 300 @xcite , both containing a wr companion , show strong evidence of a black hole primary .",
    "it is worth noting that these systems may represent a crucial link towards the evolution of a double black hole binary .",
    "the x - ray spectra of cyg x-3 are notoriously complex",
    ". basically , cyg x-3 exhibits the canonical x - ray states seen in other xrbs , namely the high / soft ( hs ) and low / hard ( lh ) states , in addition to the intermediate , very high and ultrasoft states ( e.g. @xcite , hereafter s04 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , in cyg x-3 , the strong radio emission is also classified into states of its own ( @xcite , hereafter m99 ) .",
    "recently these x - ray and radio states were implemented into a more unified picture as presented in s08 : the radio / x - ray states .",
    "the x - ray emission has been found to be linked to radio emission in cyg x-3 .",
    "m99 found that during periods of flaring activity in the radio the hard x - ray ( hxr ) flux switches from an anti - correlation to a correlation with the radio .",
    "in addition , the hxr flux has been shown to anti - correlate with the soft x - rays ( sxr ) in both canonical x - ray states @xcite .    in february 1997",
    "a large radio flare ( @xmath4 10 jy ) was observed by the green bank interferometer ( gbi ) and the ryle telescope after a period of quenched emission . at the same time , the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) onboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ detected a flare in the hxr that showed a strong correlation with the radio .",
    "the flare in the hxr was preceded by several days of very low hxr flux ( below the _ cgro_/batse one - day detection limit ) .",
    "the flare triggered a very long baseline array ( vlba ) observation to obtain high resolution radio images of cyg x-3 during the major flare .",
    "the resulting vlba observations show an expanding one - sided jet @xcite that was found to have a velocity of @xmath4 0.81@xmath5 and an inclination of @xmath4 14 degrees to our line of sight .",
    "an important tool in understanding the nature of the transient black hole systems is the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus it should be natural to look at cyg x-3 s hid and compare it to other black hole systems , all the while bearing in mind that cyg x-3 does not behave like a transient black hole xrb in outburst .",
    "nevertheless , we find the hid to be a useful tool even in this case .",
    "@xcite have taken a first look at cyg x-3 s behaviour in a hid using exosat data , where they identified two distinct branches with a possible third branch connecting these two . in this paper",
    "we further classify the different radio / x - ray states by constructing a hid for cyg x-3 from the x - ray data and adding the radio dimension in order to shed more light on the disc / jet connection in the system .",
    "this is made possible by the large amount of data available from the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) archive ( totaling to @xmath4 msec ) and simultaneous radio observations from the gbi , ratan-600 and ryle telescopes ( their monitoring programs of microquasars ) .",
    "we describe the x - ray and radio data in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we summarize the disc - jet connection of cyg x-3 and the hid of black hole systems . in section 4",
    "we summarize and refine the radio / x - ray states , in addition to presenting the hid including radio observations .",
    "we discuss the ramifications of our results in section 5 and summarize the paper in section 6 .",
    "we have analyzed , following standard procedures using ftools v6.5 , 135 archive _",
    "rxte _ observations for the hardness - intensity diagram .",
    "the observations are listed in table [ list1 ] together with exposure times of the proportional counter array ( pca ) and high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) as well as corresponding radio / x - ray states as defined in section 4.2 and radio flux during or near the observation in question ( maximum of half a day offset ) .",
    "the pca lightcurves were extracted from channels 311 and 2437 corresponding to energy ranges 36 kev and 1015 kev .",
    "these bands were chosen so as to probe different emission regions yet at the same time yielding a maximum number of counts ; in this case the sxr range represents the disc and the hxr range the comptonized part of the spectrum .",
    "each lightcurve was also corrected with correctlc_v0.1 to scale it to a single , mean pcu , so that the lightcurves are comparable to one another",
    ". then each lightcurve was binned into a 0.01 day ( 864 sec ) bin .",
    "the spectra of each pointing were extracted using the standard method as described in the _ rxte _ cook book . for the pca data , bins below 3 kev and above 20 kev",
    "were ignored , as were bins in the hexte data above 200 kev .",
    "in addition , the pca data were grouped to a minimum of 30 counts / bin and the hexte data were grouped to a minimum of 2/3/5 sigma significance per bin depending on the radio / x - ray state of the system : 2 for the hypersoft ( sxr spectra ) , 3 for the flaring and transition spectra ( intermediate x - ray spectra ) and 5 for the quiescent spectra ( hxr spectra ) .",
    "a summed spectrum was also created for each radio / x - ray state ( see section 4 ) and grouped to a minimum of three ( hypersoft ) or five sigma ( the rest ) .",
    "see section 4 for the description of different states .",
    "the spectral fit of the hypersoft state was done using isis ( interactive spectral interpretation system , @xcite ) and a 0.5% systematic error was added to the pca data .      in this work",
    "we have also used monitoring data from the all - sky monitor ( asm ) onboard _ rxte _ and from the following radio observatories : ryle ( 15 ghz ) , gbi ( 2.25 ghz and 8.3 ghz , @xcite ) and the ratan-600 ( 11.2 ghz , @xcite ) . for the asm",
    ", we used the dwell lightcurves in three different modes : single dwell , phase - selected and phase - selected daily - binned dwells . for the phase - selected dwells",
    ", we calculated the phase of each dwell and selected only those with phase inside 0.40.6 .",
    "this is done because the orbital modulation alters the lightcurve by order of two or three but inside the chosen phase range the sxr flux is rather constant @xcite .",
    "we use a cubic ephemeris @xcite for the phase determination .",
    "secondly , we bin these phase - selected dwells into a one - day bin of weighted average .",
    "we use the differently binned dwells to probe the variability of sxr for different radio / x - ray states ( see fig .",
    "[ asmhid ] ) .",
    "the disc - jet connection is one of the most intriguing aspects of accretion physics and it is not yet well established what is the underlying mechanism for launching the energetic and tightly collimated jets emanating from the central regions of the xrb systems .",
    "microquasars offer us an apt laboratory for studying this connection and cyg x-3 is a prime example of a system capable of launching relativistic jets observed as major flares in the radio .",
    "one established method for probing the disc - jet connection in transient xrbs during outburst is the hid ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) linked to simultaneous radio observations .    in this paper",
    "we create a hid for cyg x-3 .",
    "recently , there have been studies of the radio / x - ray states of cyg x-3 ( s08 ) and we associate these states as well as the x - ray spectral states presented in s04 to the hid in this paper to form a unified picture of the system . for reference",
    "we have gathered the different classification methods of the radio and x - ray spectral states in table [ cygstates ] along with the new ones proposed in this paper .",
    "we strongly urge the reader to follow this table along with the text since the spectral states , and the classifications , are highly complex and may appear otherwise confusing . based on daily examination of more than a decade of ryle and _ rxte_/asm data cyg",
    "x-3 spends roughly half the time in radio / x - ray quiescence and the rest in a flaring state .",
    "major radio flaring periods are of prime importance for studying the relationship between the accretion disc and the radio jets .",
    "we will also explore the evolution of the x - ray spectra during the major radio flares together with soft x - ray , hard x - ray and radio evolution of the monitoring data .",
    "we start by examining the historic studies of the various radio / x - ray connections .      in the first study of its kind dedicated to classifying cyg x-3 s behaviour in the x - ray and radio , @xcite compared simultaneous hxr ( _ cgro_/batse 20100 kev ) observations with radio ( gbi 2.25 and 8.3 ghz , ryle 15 ghz ) and sxr ( _ rxte_/asm 1 - 12 kev ) observations .",
    "this work was further continued in m99 .",
    "the following discoveries hold over all of the overlaps between the data sets :    \\(a ) during times of moderate radio brightness ( @xmath4 100 mjy ) , and low variability in the radio and x - ray fluxes , the hxr flux anti - correlates with the radio .",
    "it is during this time that the hxr reaches its highest level .",
    "\\(b ) during periods of flaring activity in the radio the hxr flux switches from an anti - correlation to a correlation with the radio . in particular",
    ", for major radio flares and the quenched radio emission ( very low radio fluxes of 1020 mjy ) which precedes them the correlation is strong .",
    "\\(c ) the hxr flux has been shown to anti - correlate with the sxr .",
    "this occurs in both the low / hard and high / soft x - ray states .",
    "\\(d ) the occurrences of flaring periods in the radio during the high / soft x - ray states @xcite were confirmed .",
    "\\(e ) it has been found from the _ cgro_/batse and _ cgro_/osse data that the spectrum of cyg x-3 ( in the 20100 kev band ) hardens during times of radio flaring @xcite .",
    "a typical black hole hid representing the transient outbursting cycle has a q - type shape ( @xcite , their fig .",
    "7 ) that can be divided into four main areas or states : quiescent , low / hard ( lh ) , very high / intermediate ( vhs / is ) and high / soft ( hs ) state .",
    "these areas / states are briefly reviewed in the following :    _ quiescent state ( lower right in the diagram ) _ : the source flux is very low in both the x - ray and radio with the spectrum described by a hard power law ;    _ lh ( right side ) _ : the source can be bright in the x - rays and its spectrum is described by a power law with exponential cut - off at @xmath4 100 kev .",
    "the radio emission has a flat spectrum and appears as a compact jet ;    _ vhs / is ( top ) _ : during this state there is a prominent thermal disc component and a steep power law without a cut - off ;    _ hs ( left side ) _ : this state is thermally dominated and typically there is no power law component , or if present , it is very weak .",
    "there is also a line that demarcates the vhs / is region from the hs region that is referred to as the _ jet line_. when the source crosses this line going from right to left there is a sudden cut - off of radio emission .",
    "it is during this transition that strong radio flares occur .",
    "fig . [ hid ] shows the hid for cyg x-3 .",
    "the bands were chosen so as to probe different emission regions , with the sxr ( 36 kev ) range representing the disc and hxr ( 1015 kev ) range representing the comptonized part of the spectrum .",
    "this division is also similar to work done on other black hole xrbs , e.g. 3.86.3 kev and 6.310.5 kev in @xcite ( except for grs 1915 + 105 ) or more recently 36 kev and 610 kev in @xcite .",
    "the harder band was chosen in this study to ensure that the disc ( 1.31.6 kev in the hs state ) does not significantly contribute to it .    at first glance",
    "the plot appears surprisingly similar to other black hole xrb hids , but there are some very important differences .",
    "first of all , cyg x-3 does not show hysteresis in the hid @xcite but simply increases in intensity as the spectrum softens ( maximum _ rxte_/pca intensity 1200 counts / s / pcu or @xmath6 in the 315 kev band , in the flaring / hypersoft states as compared to 200 counts / s / pcu or @xmath7 in the quiescent state ) . in black hole xrbs the lh state is present throughout the right branch , whereas in cyg x-3 the lh state is confined to the foot of the q. the right branch in this case is dominated by x - ray flaring in cyg x-3 . in addition , the flaring data are also spread into different hardnesses which wholly fill the inside area of the q.      as we see in the cyg x-3 hid , there is noticeable scatter present in the intensity for each value of hardness and the most striking transition happens when the system moves in or out of the flaring region . a vertical line in fig .",
    "[ asmhid ] ( also marked in figs .",
    "[ hidradio ] and [ hidroutes ] ) marks the change in the system from the lh state to the hs state or vice versa , and we see a corresponding increase / decrease in sxr flux ( see also spectra of different states of cyg x-3 in fig .",
    "[ plotall ] and note the difference in the sxr component between the transition state and the fhxr state ) .",
    "the scatter in the intensity is partly due to the strong orbital motion detected in the system ( e.g. @xcite ) which affects the intensity approximately by a factor of two .",
    "the orbital modulation impacts also on the hardness ratios as noted by @xcite . on top of that we expect x - ray flaring occurring in the system which will increase the variability in the intensity by some amount .    in order to study the x - ray variability in more detail we constructed a hid for cyg x-3 from all available asm data , selecting the 35 kev and 512 kev bands so as to obtain similar hardness ratios as for the pointed observations ( fig .",
    "[ asmhid ] ) . in the top panel of figure [ asmhid ]",
    "all asm dwells are plotted as gray points , phase - selected ( 0.40.6 ) dwells as black points and phase - selected daily - binned dwells as red points .",
    "we note that the hid is of the same shape as obtained from the pointed observations and the hid appears to be more continuum - like rather than displaying distinct states .",
    "also the effect of orbital modulation ( compare grey points with black and red ) is notable and constitutes about half of the scatter in intensity .",
    "the transition value of @xmath4 3 counts / s or @xmath8 in the _ rxte_/asm 35 kev band as defined in s08 is marked as a horizontal , dashed line , demarcating the hid into two regions : quiescent states are below the line and flaring states above the line as defined in s08 .",
    "a similar demarcating line can be inserted also vertically based on the variability patterns of both the radio and sxr in a quiescent state ( s08 ) , corresponding approximately to where the asm 35 kev count rate starts increasing more rapidly ( asm hardness @xmath4 0.35 ) , the quiescent states now on the right side of this line and the flaring states on the left . in the bottom panel the variability index is plotted as a function of the hardness .",
    "the index is defined as the ratio between the standard deviation and mean rate of the selected dwells ( summed asm rate 112 kev ) , in this case from the same hardness band . the index increases with the hardness except in the case of the daily binned dwells , where it stays roughly constant .",
    "however , the sxr variability in the quiescent states is not well constrained due to the low number of counts .          using all the _ rxte _ data available from 19962000",
    ", s04 divided the cyg x-3 spectra into five groups numbered 15 .",
    "groups 12 were classified as representing the hard state , groups 34 the intermediate states , and group 5 the soft state .",
    "the criterion used for this classification was the x - ray flux at 20 kev . in a more recent study ,",
    "s08 added radio data to the study of s04 , and thus refined the definition of the x - ray states taking into account the radio - activity .",
    "they employed a transitional flux level to distinguish between the states , which was @xmath4 3 counts / s or @xmath8 in the _ rxte_/asm 35 kev band and @xmath4 0.25 jy in the 8.5 ghz gbi frequency band . in the following , we present our classification of the radio / x - ray states of cyg x-3 , closely linked to the studies of s04 and s08 , but",
    "with a new take on the classical hid and including additional radio data .",
    "we will describe each one of our x - ray states in relation to those presented in the studies discussed above .    in fig .",
    "[ hidradio ] , the hid for cyg x-3 is plotted using a new approach : the data points with ( near-)simultaneous radio coverage have been coloured according to the strength of the radio flux density ( data from table [ list1 ] ) , with darker points representing a weaker radio source and lighter points a brighter radio source .",
    "thus the radio / x - ray states are clearly revealed in the hid and we divide them according to the x - ray hardness and/or radio flux into three distinct areas that we call hypersoft , flaring and quiescent .",
    "in addition , the flaring state can be further subdivided according to x - ray hardness and the shape of the spectra : flaring / soft x - ray ( fsxr ) , flaring / intermediate ( fim ) and flaring / hard x - ray ( fhxr ) .",
    "the quiescent state can also be subdivided into two regions : quiescent and transition .",
    "these subdivisions are rather ad hoc since the flaring spectra and the quiescent spectra are more or less continuous as is seen in fig .",
    "[ asmhid ] , but the division is made so that we can compare the spectra with those presented in s04 and s08 .",
    "the spectra for all states are shown in fig .",
    "[ plotall ] ( average of each state , all states plotted in the same figure ) , and reproduced above the hid in fig .",
    "[ hidradio ] .",
    "the descriptions of the states from this study and those of s04 and s08 with as close correspondence as possible are tabulated in table [ cygstates ] . in the following",

    "the quiescent region comprises the lower right corner of the hid , bounded by the flaring region on the left side .",
    "based on the ryle and _ rxte_/asm 3 - 5 kev data and imposing a cut - off of 200 mjy in the radio and 3 counts / s in the asm data to demarcate the quiescent from the flaring states , cyg x-3 is found to spend @xmath4 52 % of the time in the quiescent states and the rest in the flaring states .",
    "the quiescent region corresponds to the quiescent state of s08 and the spectra of this region correspond to the spectra of groups 1 and 2 of s04 and therefore are divided here into two states : the quiescent state and the transition state .",
    "the quiescent state has a low number of counts in the sxr and therefore the level of sxr variability is not well constrained ( see fig . [ asmhid ] ) .",
    "the hxr and radio variability are low compared to the flaring states .",
    "the radio spectrum is optically thick and the radio varies in a correlated manner with the sxr below the transition level as defined in s08 .",
    "in addition , the hxr flux anti - correlates with the radio ( m99 ) . in the quiescent region cyg x-3 is still relatively bright in both the x - ray and the radio ( 60200 mjy ) as compared to other black hole xrb systems in this state .",
    "a recent study @xcite of the low / hard state of cyg x-3 using _ integral _ found : ( 1 ) the hxr spectrum has a cut - off at @xmath4 20 kev ( for most black hole xrbs in a state similar to this one the cut - off occurs at @xmath4 100 kev ) , this cut - off at lower - than - expected energies has recently been explained as being due to compton downscattering from a nearby medium @xcite ; ( 2 ) there is a significant contribution from non - thermal comptonization , which is usually observed only in soft states ; and ( 3 ) the luminosity of the hard state is significantly higher than other xrbs in this state , implying a model much more radiatively efficient than the standard adaf models or a mass of the compact object @xmath11 20m@xmath12 .",
    "the transition state is between the quiescent and flaring regions in the hid . in the transition region",
    "the radio flux starts to increase and the power law component of the spectrum starts to flatten shifting the hxr spectral peak towards softer energies , i.e. the x - ray hardness decreases and the source moves to the left in the hid .",
    "however , the overall x - ray spectrum is still similar to the quiescent / lh state spectrum and the variability in intensity remains similar to the quiescent state .",
    "also the hxr variability at the level of the quiescent state and the movement in the asm hid ( fig .",
    "[ asmhid ] ) appears to be continuous .",
    "however , the radio variability increases to the level of flaring states indicating the commencement of minor radio flaring .",
    "the flaring region comprises the main part of the cyg x-3 hid .",
    "it is bound by the transition region on the right side and the hypersoft region on the left side .",
    "the most striking aspect of the flaring states is the increased radio and x - ray emission which corresponds to the canonical spectral change from the lh to the hs state when the intensity of the soft component increases .",
    "this region corresponds to the minor flaring , major flaring , suppressed and  post - flaring \" states of s08 , where the x - ray flux is around or above the transition level and the radio flux varies from below the transition level to above it .",
    "also the hxr changes from an anti - correlation with the radio to a correlation during the major flare events ( m99 ) .",
    "the sxr variability stays at the level of or decreases slightly from the level of quiescent states .",
    "we have further divided the flaring region into three areas to better specify the different x - ray states that occur in this region and to relate them to those presented in s04 and s08 .",
    "however , we note that the flaring substates appear to be rather continuous instead of being strictly individual states ( see fig .",
    "[ asmhid ] ) .    during the fhxr state cyg x-3 displays various types of flaring .",
    "closer to the transition region cyg x-3 exhibits minor flaring in the radio but also experiences major flares when the radio emission increases ( 520 jy ) . in a normal",
    "hid for a black hole system this vertical branch would correspond to the lh state .",
    "however , in cyg x-3 , the major flares are spread within the whole flaring region of the hid and they are also found in the fim and fsxr states .",
    "the difference is apparent in the x - ray spectra .",
    "the spectrum of the fhxr state is dominated by a thermal component but it also shows a significant amount of hxr .",
    "this state represents the spectra of group 3 in s04 . to examine any differences in the x - ray spectra associated with different radio behaviour , the composite spectra of the fhxr state",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fhxr ] for radio flux below 300 mjy ( minor radio flaring ) and above 1 jy ( major radio flaring ) .",
    "the dramatic difference in radio flux density does not affect the x - ray spectra much .",
    "the major radio flaring fhxr spectrum has more flux in the sxr below 25 kev , a slightly steeper power law in the hxr and more flux in the iron line region .",
    "the sharp spectral feature around 70 kev in the minor radio flaring fhxr spectrum is most likely due to the hexte background emission line features . also , the increasing flux above 100 kev is most likely a calibration issue .",
    "this state lies between the areas of fhxr and fsxr in the hid and is characterized by major flaring .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is similar to the fhxr spectrum with slightly less contribution to the hxr and corresponds to group 4 spectra in s04 .",
    "the fim and fhxr are the states in which cyg x-3 mainly alternates right after a major flare event .",
    "the left vertical branch of the hid consists of two distinct states although they might not be distinguishable at first glance from the x - ray spectra .",
    "the whole branch forms the ultrasoft state of s04 ( group 5 ) and quenched state of s08 which is a pre - flare state occurring before a major flare event .",
    "however , when taking into account the simultaneous radio data this branch is clearly divided in two parts : the fsxr state and the hypersoft state .",
    "the spectrum of the fsxr state is soft without significant hxr emission .",
    "however , it shows a weak power law tail extending to higher energies .",
    "very long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) observations during one of these types of flares , being a major flare , did not reveal any jet - like structure @xcite indicating that the jet is not yet fully visible in this state or that it is possibly disrupted .",
    "the line that demarcates these two states is the so - called _ jet line _ and",
    "most remarkably , unlike transient black hole xrbs , cyg x-3 crosses this line from right to left ( from fsxr to hypersoft ) without producing a major radio flare .",
    "it is only when it crosses from left to right that a major flare occurs .      during the quenched state ( s08 ) , the radio emission falls to very low values ( 1020 mjy , and often decreases to 12 mjy in the ryle data ) , the hxr vanishes , and thus the hxr and radio switch from an anti - correlation to a correlation . in this state ,",
    "the radio flux is well below and the sxr is above the transition level , and it is after cyg x-3 emerges from this state that a major radio flare occurs .",
    "the first two _ integral _ observations of 2007 may are likely representative of this quenched state @xcite , during which the x - ray spectrum was very soft ( as deduced from the x - ray fluxes in the 210 and 2060 kev bands ) with a weak and hard power law tail ( @xmath13=1.71.9 ) .",
    "however , in re - examining the x - ray spectra using our new demarcation technique , we find that there is a group of spectra that are even softer than the fsxr ( or the ultrasoft of s04 ) and in which the power law tail is an order of magnitude fainter than in the quenched state of s08 .",
    "this state was previously included in group 5 in s04 , but employing the radio fluxes in the hid , we find that this group is in fact distinct from the ultrasoft state . _",
    "we denote this new x - ray state of cyg x-3 the hypersoft state_.",
    "as mentioned above , cyg x-3 s hid is remarkably similar _ in shape _ to that of transient black hole xrbs even though it is not strictly speaking a transient source . despite the similarity , however , cyg x-3 does not cycle through the hid like other black hole xrbs .",
    "rather , it traces a path from right to left ( indicating spectral softening ) or then from left to right ( spectral hardening ) , with changes in intensity within each state . by looking at fig .",
    "[ asmhid ] it appears that the movement across the hid is continuous with no discernible gaps in between .",
    "this result differs from that obtained by @xcite , where they found two branches and possibly a third one connecting these two in the hid .",
    "however , the discrepancy could arise from the lack of observations or the slightly different hardness used in their work ( 5.519.0 kev/3.5 - 5.5 kev ) . from the spectra it appears that there are three major components in play : a thermal disc , a comptonized thermal component and a comptonized non - thermal component .",
    "when the source moves from right to left the contribution of the thermal disc increases .",
    "the changes in this component are simply mapping the accretion on to the compact object . at the same time the hxr component decreases , but there are two effects contributing to this change : the overall hxr flux is dropping and the x - ray spectrum is changing from one that is dominated by thermal comptonization to one that is dominated by non - thermal comptonization . the fact that the radio flux density increases when the source enters the flaring region and , at the same time , the hxr switches from an anti - correlation to a correlation during major flares , indicates a relationship between the radio and the non - thermal comptonization .    to further investigate the thermal / non - thermal comptonization shift in the source ,",
    "we have fitted the pointed _ rxte _ spectra above 20 kev with a power law model .",
    "the resulting photon index ( @xmath13 ) and reduced chi - square values ( @xmath14 ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ curvature ] .",
    "a larger chi - square value indicates more curvature in the spectra and therefore more thermal comptonization .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that the thermal hxr component is present in the quiescent states and the hxr component is more non - thermal in the flaring states . also , the photon index changes from @xmath4 3 in the quiescent states to decreasing steadily from 3 to 1.5 in the flaring states .        in fig .",
    "[ flare ] , a major radio flaring period consisting of two major flares is plotted together with the _ rxte _ pointings ( p50062 ) . this same event is part of the state transition curve in fig .",
    "[ hidroutes ] , which shows the evolution of cyg x-3 in the hid from quiescent states to flaring states and back .",
    "this same period was also analyzed in s08 where they show the succession of the x - ray spectra and corresponding models ( in their fig .",
    "8b ) . from figs .",
    "[ flare ] and [ hidroutes ] we can follow the succession of the radio / x - ray states of cyg x-3 including periods of major radio flaring . also in this case cyg x-3 differs from the transient black hole xrbs that trace their hids anti - clockwise .",
    "instead , cyg x-3 starts in the quiescent state and moves to the hypersoft branch and after a major radio flare enters the fhxr state via the fsxr / fim states .",
    "this flaring episode can repeat as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ flare ] .",
    "eventually cyg x-3 will return to the quiescent state .",
    "it is hard to pinpoint any particular route that cyg x-3 follows , except that the different radio / x - ray states are followed in succession .",
    "most likely the spread in the intensity comes from x - ray flaring and hysteresis does not occur in the system .    from fig .",
    "[ hidroutes ] we can zoom on the major radio flaring events as shown in fig .",
    "[ flare ] and see that from the fim / fsxr state after the first major flare cyg x-3 enters the hypersoft state just before the second major flare .",
    "s08 discussed that during this time of the hxr tail or radio major flare the non - thermal electrons may be accelerated to high enough energies to result in detectable emission in @xmath15-rays in the gev / tev range .",
    "recently , there have been observations of gev emission before the onset of a major radio flare and when cyg x-3 exhibited similar properties to the hypersoft state @xcite , i.e. high sxr flux and very low or non - existent radio emission , indicating a major ejection of highly relativistic particles which will then most likely form the radio jet a few days later . in this particular case",
    ", the decaying of the first major flare leads to a higher radio flux density ( @xmath4 0.1 jy ) that usually is observed together with the hypersoft state . however , it is likely that the system is quenching based on the x - ray state . from the hypersoft state cyg x-3 enters the fsxr state , and after the peak of the second radio flare , it enters the fim state . throughout this progression ,",
    "the power in the non - thermal hxr increases . during",
    "the decline of the second major flare cyg x-3 enters the fhxr state and thermal comptonization starts to dominate the hxr spectra .",
    "the minor flaring also present in the fhxr state spectra might arise in the aftermath of a major flaring event representing subsequent but smaller ejections .",
    "we note that during our case the two major flares present behave very differently with the first flare exhibiting little hxr emission and the second flare exhibiting significantly more ( see the discrepancy of hardnesses in fig .",
    "[ hidroutes ] ) . a possible mechanism for creating the difference",
    "is discussed in section 5.2.1 .",
    "cyg x-3 also has the added distinction of exhibiting radio flares _ only _ when crossing the jet line from left to right ( spectral hardening ) , rather than from right to left ( spectral softening ) like other black hole xrbs .",
    "[ flare ] shows that cyg x-3 produces multiple major radio flares during major flaring periods and additional quenching periods between the flares .",
    "however , their detection without accompanying x - ray observations may be difficult because the decaying initial major radio flare dominates the radio emission .",
    "we also note that the power density spectra ( pds ) of cyg x-3 are not a good indicator of state and that on the short time - scales all the soft state pds can be fit by a power law with index approximately 2 and that basically there is no power above @xmath4 1 hz ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this most likely comes from the scattering in the wr wind @xcite and the 2 power law is characteristic of a random walk process likely produced by flares in the x - ray ."
