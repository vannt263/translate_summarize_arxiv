    "synchronization is one possible form of emergent dynamics displayed by coupled oscillator systems and this is seen in a wide variety of physical phenomena , e.g , synchrony among neural activity in the brain @xcite , intensity of coupled lasers to light pulses emitted by fireflies @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that two chaotic systems , with appropriate coupling , can exhibit synchronized behavior @xcite .",
    "synchronized chaotic dynamics has been reported in systems consisting of well known models of chaos like the logistic map , lorentz system , henon map , coupled map lattices etc . , which represent a wide collection of discrete and continuous time systems .",
    "the growing interest in chaos and synchronization is partly due to its potential applications in chaos control , chaos based cryptography , neural networks and biological systems .",
    "much of the work on synchronization has concentrated on instantaneous coupling of the dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "this implies that we disregard the finite time it takes for the interaction or the information to travel from one system to the other .",
    "consider two identical chaotic systems represented by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , started from different initial conditions .",
    "to synchronize their solutions , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we suitably couple both the systems",
    ". then the modified equations will be @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in this form of coupling",
    ", we have implicitly assumed that @xmath3 is instantly available to the @xmath6-system without any delay and vice versa .",
    "this can not be true in general .",
    "many physical phenomena that display synchronization are often spatially separated and the time taken for the information to travel is not negligible .",
    "for example , synchronization of neuronal activity in the brain involves time delays due to information processing and transfer between different parts of the brain @xcite and is estimated to be about tens of milliseconds @xcite . in the context of using chaos synchronization for secure communication , it is usual for the sender and receiver to be spatially separated and information takes finite time to travel between them .",
    "then , the question is , can the delayed interactions lead to synchronization of coupled systems ?",
    "the works done in the last few years show that delayed couplings can lead to synchronization @xcite as well as new scenarios such as amplitude death in limit cycle oscillators and coupled oscillators @xcite , multi stable synchronization @xcite and symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "techniques for controlling pathological rhythms in neurons based on delayed feedback have also been reported @xcite .",
    "the experiments on information processing in the brain and neurosciences are providing evidence for new features of delayed synchronization , namely that of near zero delay synchronization of signals from spatially separated regions @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that spatially separated cortical regions in the brain of the cat display synchronization _ without any lag _ @xcite .",
    "neuronal firings from left and right cortex regions recorded on primates show near zero synchrony maintained over considerable distances @xcite .",
    "the idea of spatially distributed systems synchronizing without delay continues to attract research attention since the mechanism leading to such an effect is not yet clear and continues to be debated @xcite .",
    "recently one mechanism for zero delay synchronization of mutually coupled oscillators has been demonstrated experimentally in a system of three semiconductor lasers @xcite . in this case , a central driving laser l@xmath7 is bidirectionally coupled with two other mutually delay coupled lasers , l@xmath8 and l@xmath9 .",
    "then , the delay coupled lasers l@xmath8 and l@xmath9 display zero delay or isochronal synchronization and is shown to be reasonably robust . a variant of this scheme has been used to propose a method for bidirectional secure communication using delay coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the modeling and analysis of zero lag synchronization maintained over large distances in neurons is beginning to take shape @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we show that zero delay synchronization can be achieved in delay coupled spatially extended systems , namely a coupled map lattice ( cml ) , if they are driven by a third such system .",
    "this application is motivated by the fact that the activity in the cerebral cortex of the brain ( as measured by electroencephalograph , for example ) is due to the interaction between millions of neurons that are spatially distributed .",
    "the zero lag synchronization occurs between groups of such spatially distributed neurons .",
    "hence one is led to consider a collection of coupled oscillators that are spatially separated .",
    "another important application is in the area of secure communication . coupled map lattices",
    "can be applied to encryption of messages in multi - channel communication @xcite . in real - time , for multichannel communications that require security , there is a need for as many different chaotic signals as the number of channels to encode the messages sent in each of the channels .",
    "signals in these channels are encoded by the chaotic time series from one of the lattice points of the cml .",
    "the cml , being a high dimensional chaotic system , provides sufficient security against most attacks .",
    "presence of chaotic , zero delay synchronization would allow the receiver to decode the message in all the channels at the same time . for real - time applications synchronization",
    "must be achieved in shortest possible time and zero delay synchronization is ideally suited for this purpose . for a review of certain aspects of synchronization in spatially extended systems and its applications , see ref @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the coupled map lattice paradigm and introduce our model .",
    "further , in subsequent sections , we report results on zero lag synchronization from this model , obtain analytically the parametric regimes where this occurs and also bounds for synchronization errors due to parameter mismatches .",
    "we consider the coupled map lattice given by , @xmath10 + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2 }    \\left ( f[x_n^{i-1 } ]   + f[x_n^{i+1 } ] \\right ) \\label{cml}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the index for the lattice site and @xmath12 is the coupling strength parameter .",

    "experiments in neuronal studies have reported examples of synchronization with error in spatially distributed neurons @xcite . from the form of analytical estimates in eqns .",
    "( [ mm1],[adep2 ] ) and ( [ epsdep1 ] ) , it might appear as though @xmath18-cml has no role to play in synchronizing the coupled dynamics .",
    "the contribution of @xmath18-cml enters the @xmath6- and @xmath17-cml through the mutual coupling terms with the delay @xmath20 .",
    "we have shown through numerical simulations that two coupled map lattices , say , @xmath6-cml and @xmath17-cml , which are coupled to one another with a delay can display _ isochronal _ synchronization if they are driven by a third cml .",
    "we have used periodic boundary conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ , a ring type lattice for the cmls in the results presented here . the central result remains unaltered even if we use a different boundary condition , e.g , the one way coupled map lattice with ring or open type boundary conditions . while the isochronal synchronization is achieved irrespective of the boundary conditions , the parametric regimes in which this synchrony occurs depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "our results also indicate that there is a critical value for the coupling strength @xmath12 above which the synchronization occurs .",
    "we have analytically studied how the strength parameters @xmath31 and @xmath48 and the delay @xmath20 affect isochronal synchronization .",
    "an interesting feature is that the presence of delays leads to synchronization in larger parametric regime when compared with the case with absence of mutual coupling .    the original motivation for this work was to look for possible mechanisms that could explain isochronal synchronization occuring in neuronal systems @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we considered one dimensional coupled map lattices with nearest neighbour coupling even though they are not known to be models for a collection of neurons in the brain .",
    "however , we expect qualitatively similar results for models of neurons too @xcite . in general ,",
    "higher dimensional extensions of cmls are possible and they display much richer variety of collective properties like phase synchronized states and cluster synchronization @xcite which could modifiy the scenario presented in this work",
    ". it would be interesting to study isochronal synchronization in higher dimensional coupled map systems .",
    "it is known that two mutually coupled oscillators synchronize with one another .",
    "however , the question of isochronal synchronization in mutually delay - coupled oscillators is currently being actively pursued in view of its applications in biological systems .",
    "the results discussed here provide one possible mechanism for isochronal synchronization in delay - coupled spatially extended systems .",
    "we have also obtained analytical estimates for bounds on errors due to mismatches in parameters between the two cmls and verified them in simulations .",
    "we have also simulated this scheme with one way coupled map lattice @xcite and qualitatively the results are the same as discussed above",
    ". it would be interesting to study isochronal synchronization in delay coupled physical systems and in their realistic models .",
    "further , other coupling topologies can also be implemented to study if synchronized solutions such as the one discussed here is supported in them .",
    "the results discussed in this work will help understand the effects of delay coupling in spatially separated , extended physical systems .",
