    "the alexander polynomial of singular curves in @xmath12 provides an effective way to relate the fundamental group of the complement of such curves to the topology and geometry of their singularities . in this paper",

    ", the local type of its singularities , and their _ position _ , relating the latter to the topology , has been known for some time ( cf .",
    "for example , for irreducible curves having nodes and cusps as the only singularities , the degree of the alexander polynomial @xmath8 equals @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the first and second commutators of @xmath22 ( in this case there is only one choice , up to sign , of @xmath23 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 is not trivial only if @xmath24 , in which case @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the superabundance of the curves of degree @xmath27 passing through the cusps of @xmath18 . for a given curve",
    ", this provides a purely geometric method for calculation of the alexander polynomial .",
    "however , how big can this superabundance be for a special cuspidal curve is still not known ( cf .",
    "the largest known value of @xmath26 for irreducible cuspidal curves , to our knowledge , is 3 .",
    "this occurs for the dual curve to a non - singular cubic , that is a sextic with 9 cusps . in this paper",
    "we give an example of an irreducible curve with nodes and cusps as only singularities , for which the superabundance of the set of cusps is equal to 4 .",
    "one of our main results is the inequality ( cf .",
    "corollary  [ inequality ] ) : @xmath28    for reducible curves and general @xmath23 , the explicit relation with the fundamental group comes from the equality ( cf .",

    "the main idea in this note is to relate the degree of the alexander polynomial to the rank of the mordell - weil group over the field @xmath39 of elliptic curves with @xmath13-invariant equal to either zero or 1728 .",
    "this is done by relating the alexander module of @xmath22 to rational pencils of elliptic type corresponding to @xmath11 ( cf . definition  [ def - orb ] ) .",
    "the relationship between alexander invariants and pencils , in the case of line arrangements and reducible curves is discussed in  @xcite : the positive dimensional components of characteristic varieties induce maps between their complements and the complements to @xmath40 points in @xmath41 . here",
    "we show that non - vanishing of alexander polynomial of a curve yields existence of special pencils with non - reduced fibers .",
    "these pencils are such that they induce rational maps from @xmath15 onto @xmath41 with an orbifold structure and take the curve @xmath18 onto a finite set of points .",
    "the pencils are orbifold elliptic pencils in the following sense ( cf .",
    "definitions  [ def - orb ] and  [ dfn - group - orb ] ) : each map @xmath42 has three non - reduced fibers of the form @xmath43 , where @xmath44 divides the equation of @xmath18 .",
    "the multiplicities @xmath45 are such that @xmath46 and thus the orbifold structure is given by assigning multiplicities @xmath45 to those three points in @xmath41 .",
    "the possible orbifold structures @xmath47 depend on the local type of singularities of @xmath18 .",
    "for example for irreducible curves with only nodes and cusps as singularities , we relate the global alexander polynomial of @xmath18 to the following functional relation : @xmath48 where @xmath11 is an equation of @xmath18 and @xmath49 are homogeneous polynomials .",
    "such a relation is equivalent to the existence of a rational map from @xmath15 onto @xmath41 with the orbifold structure @xmath50 .",
    "this orbifold structure can be obtained considering the global orbifold in the usual sense ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) corresponding to the action of a cyclic group of order 6 on an elliptic curve with non - trivial stabilizers at three points ; their orders being equal to @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the correspondence between the alexander modules and orbifold elliptic pencils is established in two rather different steps .",
    "on one hand , the alexander module of @xmath18 can be related to the mordell - weil group of the elliptic threefold : @xmath53 over the field @xmath39 of rational functions in two variables having @xmath13-invariant equal to zero .",
    "we have the following ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ theoremonwf ] ) :    let @xmath18 be an irreducible curve in @xmath15 having ordinary nodes and cusps as the only singularities .",
    "let @xmath54 be a ( reduced ) equation of the affine part of @xmath18 .",
    "then the @xmath55-rank of the mordell - weil group of the elliptic threefold ( [ threefold-2 ] ) is equal to the degree of the alexander polynomial of the curve @xmath18 .",
    "the mordell - weil group here is the group of rational sections of the elliptic threefolds ( see for instance  @xcite and section  [ sec - mordellweil ] for further discussion ) .",
    "the rank of the mordell - weil group of the threefold   was recently studied in  @xcite for the case @xmath56 using different methods ( cf . also  @xcite ) .",
    "these results follow immediately from the correspondence between alexander polynomials and mordell - weil groups in this paper since the alexander polynomials of sextic curves considered in  @xcite are readily available .    on the other hand ,",
    "each element of the mordell - weil group of the aforementioned elliptic threefold defines a functional relation of the type  .",
    "this can be summarized as follows ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ cor - kulikov ] ) :    for any irreducible plane curve @xmath57 whose only singularities are nodes and cusps the following statements are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath18 admits a quasi - toric relation of elliptic type @xmath50 , 2 .",
    "@xmath18 admits an infinite number of quasi - toric relations of elliptic type @xmath50 , 3 .",
    "@xmath8 is not trivial ( @xmath58 ) .",
    ", up to sign , i.e. @xmath59 is independent of it ; for other types of quasi - toric relations see section [ sec - examples ] ]    moreover , the set of quasi - toric relations of @xmath18 @xmath60 ^ 3\\mid f^2+g^3+h^6f=0\\}$ ] has a group structure and it is isomorphic to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "also , @xmath18 admits an infinite number of primitive quasi - toric relations , unless @xmath63 , in which case @xmath18 only has one primitive quasi - toric relation .",
    "we also consider here other singularities which will define relations of the form : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is either @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "such relations in turn correspond to orbifold rational pencils with respective orbifold structures ( cf .",
    "theorem [ cor - kulikov - gen ] ) .    while commonly the existence of irrational pencils on surfaces is obtained by an extension of the defranchis method ( from 1-form with vanishing wedge product , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , rational orbifold pencils are obtained rather differently : here the pencils are a byproduct of the splitting of albanese varieties of cyclic multiple planes into a product of elliptic curves which we derive either from roan s decomposition theorem for abelian varieties with an automorphism ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) or directly , using a hodge theoretical refinement of the argument used in the proof of divisibility theorem in @xcite .",
    "for example for the cyclic multiple planes branched over a reduced curve with nodes and cusps as the only singularities , the albanese variety splits as a product of elliptic curves with @xmath13-invariant equal to zero .",
    "one may contrast this with the case of jacobians of curves where the situation is different ( cf .  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the relation between alexander polynomials and mordell - weil groups allows us to give bounds   on the degree of alexander polynomials .",
    "these follow from the bounds on the rank of mordell - weil groups obtained from the connection with the mordell - weil groups of certain elliptic surfaces and from the shioda - tate formula ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the correspondence between the alexander polynomials and the ranks of the mordell - weil group should be of independent interest ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the curves with the largest known values of @xmath68 are given in section  [ sec - examples ] .",
    "the bound presented here is sharp for sextics , however , the inequality   is apparently far from being sharp in general .",
    "perhaps a better understanding of the mordell - weil rank of   can yield a better estimate .",
    "also , note that corollary  [ inequality ] provides a partial answer to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 2.1 ) .",
    "another application of the results presented in this paper is an alternative argument to confirm oka s conjecture of sextic curves having a non - trivial alexander polynomial ( i.e. that equations of such curves have form @xmath69 ) .",
    "the answer to oka s conjecture was first obtained by a.  degtyarev ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the sake of clarity",
    "we often start our discussions focusing on the case of irreducible curves having only nodes and cusps as singularities .",
    "the results , however , are obtained , as was already mentioned , for curves with a wider class of singularities , which we call @xmath70-essential and @xmath70-partial ( cf .",
    "[ deltapartial ] ) . moreover the results are applicable to reducible and non - reduced curves as well . from the point of view of fundamental groups ,",
    "non - reduced curves correspond to homomorphisms @xmath23 that are more general than those given by the linking number of loops with  @xmath18 .",
    "the condition of being @xmath70-essential is purely local , meaning that the local alexander polynomial of the link of the singularity considered w.r.t .",
    "the restriction of @xmath23 on the local fundamental group is divisible by the cyclotomic polynomial of degree  @xmath70 .",
    "as we shall see , this is the natural class of curves leading to the elliptic pencils .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec - settings ]",
    "we give definitions for alexander polynomials w.r.t .",
    "any homomorphism @xmath23 ( as mentioned above ) , for orbifold surfaces and morphisms , and for quasi - toric relations . in section  [ sec - mordellweil ]",

    "we generalize the results to a larger class of curves .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - examples ] a list of explicit examples and applications is given as to show curves that fit into quasi - toric relations of all rational orbifolds of elliptic type .",
