    "a search through the spires database reveals over 350 articles whose titles contain the expressions ` quark jet(s ) ' or ` gluon jet(s ) ' @xcite .",
    "the idea of quark and gluon jets appears so intuitive that it hardly seems necessary to examine the question of what it means . yet , when going beyond leading order perturbative qcd , the concept of quark and gluon jets is only meaningful once a procedure has been defined to classify an ensemble of partons into a set of jets , each with a well - defined flavour  a flavour that is insensitive to the addition of extra soft or collinear branchings . to our knowledge",
    "the question of how to do this in general has not been addressed in the literature .    as well as being of intrinsic interest , the question of how to define the flavour of a partonic jet is becoming of increasing practical importance as the study of qcd is extended to multi - jet ensembles ( by jets we mean both incoming and outgoing ones ) : in studies of @xmath9  jets one knows that the basic @xmath10-jet born configuration consists of quark jets ; but for jet production at hadron colliders , the born configuration involves @xmath10 incoming and @xmath10 outgoing jets and many flavour channels are possible , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , etc .",
    "the ability to assign flavours to the jets is especially useful when combining fixed - order predictions with all - order calculations ( be it for parton showers as in @xcite or for analytical resummation @xcite ) .",
    "this is because all - order calculations are carried out for a fixed born configuration , with a single flavour channel at a time , while fixed - order calculations implicitly sum over all flavour channels and can at best be split up a posteriori to match onto the individual flavour channels of the all - order calculation .    as a concrete example , consider the calculation of higher - order corrections to the process @xmath14 , fig .",
    "[ fig:2to3]a .",
    "an all - order calculation treats the addition of any number of soft / collinear gluons and extra @xmath15 pairs implicitly , leaving the underlying @xmath16 flavours unchanged .",
    "when trying to supplement this with results of a fixed order calculation one encounters the problem that higher - order contributions can not be uniquely assigned to any given @xmath16 flavour channel  the @xmath17 corrections to @xmath14 include e.g.  a @xmath18 piece , but a fixed order calculation gives only the squared sum of all @xmath19 diagrams , among them @xmath20 and @xmath21 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2to3]b and [ fig:2to3]c respectively",
    ". there can exist no unambiguous procedure for separating the @xmath22 contribution into its different underlying channels , both because the different channels are not individually gauge invariant and because they interfere when squaring the amplitude .",
    "flavour channel for a @xmath23 parton scattering process ; ( b ) higher - order diagram that can be seen as a correction to ( a ) ; ( c ) higher - order diagram that can be seen as a correction to the process @xmath24 , but with the same final - state partons as ( b).,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    one therefore needs a prescription to assign @xmath22 either to the @xmath25 or the @xmath26 underlying born @xmath23 process ( or else to declare it irreducibly @xmath27 like ) , it only being in the @xmath25 case that one needs to put it together with the @xmath14 all - order calculation .",
    "this reclassification of a @xmath28 event as a @xmath23 event is similar conceptually to what is done in a normal jet algorithm , except that not only should the momenta of the resulting @xmath23 configuration be infrared and collinear safe , but so should the flavours .",
    "accordingly we call it a jet - flavour algorithm",
    ".    an obvious approach to defining jet flavours at the perturbative level would be to start with an existing jet algorithm , such as the @xmath0-clustering @xcite or cone @xcite algorithm , that defines jets such that each particle belongs to at most one jet .",
    "one can then determine the net flavour content of each of the jets , as the total number of quarks minus antiquarks for each quark flavour .",
    "jets with no net flavour are identified as gluon jets , those with ( minus ) one unit of net flavour are ( anti ) quark jets , while those with more than one unit of flavour ( or both a flavour and a different antiflavour ) can not be identified with a single qcd parton .",
    "pair ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) with the @xmath31 and @xmath32 then clustered into different jets ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) . ]    applied to the @xmath0 or cone algorithms , this procedure yields a jet flavour that is infrared ( ir ) safe at ( relative ) order @xmath35 discussed in our example above .",
    "however at ( relative ) order @xmath36 a large - angle soft gluon can split into a widely separated soft @xmath37 pair and the @xmath31 and @xmath32 may end up being clustered into different jets , ` polluting ' the flavour of those jets , see fig .",
    "[ fig : badjets ] . because this happens for arbitrarily soft gluons branching to quarks , the resulting jet flavours are infrared unsafe from order @xmath36 onwards .",
    "we are not aware of this problem having been discussed previously in the literature , though there do exist statements that are suggestive of ir safety issues when discussing flavour @xcite .    in section  [ sec : k_t - flav - algor ] we shall discuss ir flavour unsafety with respect to the @xmath0 ( or ` durham ' ) algorithm in @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "there we shall recall that the @xmath0 closeness measure is specifically related to the divergences of qcd matrix elements when producing soft and collinear gluons .",
    "however there are no divergences for the production of soft quarks and , as we shall see , it is the use for quarks of a distance measure designed for gluons that leads to the infrared unsafety of jet flavour in the @xmath0 algorithm . by taking into account the absence of a soft - quark divergence when designing the jet - clustering distance measure , one can eliminate the infrared divergence of the jet flavour .",
    "the essence of the modification to the @xmath0 distance is that instead of the @xmath39 factor that appears usually , one needs to use @xmath40 when the softer of @xmath41 is a quark . in section  [ sec : flav - algor - hadr ] we will examine how this can be extended to processes with incoming hadrons .",
    "there the added difficulty is the need for a particle - beam distance measure .",
    "traditionally this involves only one dimensionful scale , related to the squared transverse - momentum @xmath42 of the particle .",
    "there is a sense in which this can be understood as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is some transverse scale associated with the beam that is larger than all @xmath42 and so could up to now be ignored . in order to obtain a sensible jet - flavour algorithm we shall however need to consider also @xmath45 and therefore in section  [ sec : flav - algor - hadr ]",
    "we shall investigate how to construct sensible ` beam scales ' .",
    "as well as explaining how to build jet algorithms that provide an infrared safe jet flavour , we shall also examine how they fare in practice .",
    "in @xmath38 it will be possible to carry out tests both with an nlo code ( which explicitly reveals the ir unsafety of flavour in traditional jet algorithms ) and with parton - shower monte carlo codes . for hadron - hadron collisions only parton - shower monte carlo tests",
    "will be possible because none of the currently available nlo codes provides access to the final - state parton flavour information .",
    "the aim of clustering algorithms is to recombine particles into jets in a manner that approximates the inverse of the nearly probabilistic picture of ordered qcd branching .",
    "since , however , the branching itself is a quantum mechanical process , there is no unique way of inverting it for a given final ensemble of particles .",
    "what can at most be done is to design it to work correctly in limits in which the qcd branching behaves classically , e.g.  when a given particle is emitted as if from a single identifiable parent .",
    "the design of good jet algorithms is therefore more a craft than a deductive science .",
    "nevertheless certain general principles will help us identify how to extend existing jet algorithms to deal properly with flavour .",
    "let us start by considering the most widespread clustering algorithm , the standard @xmath38 durham ( or @xmath0 ) algorithm  @xcite :    1 .",
    "introduce a distance measure @xmath48 between every pair of partons @xmath49 , @xmath50 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the energy of particle @xmath49 , @xmath53 is the angle between particles @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath54 is the centre of mass energy .",
    "2 .   find the specific @xmath49 and @xmath50 that correspond to the smallest @xmath48 and recombine them according to some recombination scheme ( we shall here use the @xmath55 scheme , which sums the four - momenta ) .",
    "3 .   repeat the procedure until all @xmath56 ( or , alternatively , until one reaches a predetermined number of jets ) .",
    "the defining characteristic of such clustering algorithms is the distance measure , because it determines the order in which emissions are recombined .",
    "it is closely related to the divergences of the qcd matrix elements  for a gluon @xmath50 that is soft and collinear to a gluon @xmath49 the product of phase - space and matrix element for a parent gluon to branch to @xmath49 and @xmath50 is @xmath57 |m^2_{g\\to g_i g_j}(k_j)| \\simeq \\frac{{\\alpha_s}{c_a}}{\\pi } \\frac{de_j}{e_j }    \\frac{d\\theta_{ij}^2}{\\theta_{ij}^2}\\ , , \\qquad ( e_j \\ll e_i\\ , , \\;\\ ,    \\theta_{ij } \\ll 1)\\,.\\ ] ] thus with the distance measure eq .",
    "( [ eq : yij ] ) , two particles are deemed to be close when either of the parameters in which the matrix element has a divergence , @xmath58 or @xmath53 , is small .",
    "this is a key characteristic of a good distance measure because where there is a strong divergence there will be many splittings that are independent of the ` hard ' properties of the event  such splittings should be undone ( recombined ) at the early stages of the clustering to leave at the end only well - separated hard pseudo - jets .",
    "a second key characteristic of a distance measure can be understood by examining the jade algorithm  @xcite , which is identical to ( and predates ) the @xmath0 algorithm , except that its distance measure is @xmath59 again , for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , the distance @xmath62 becomes smaller when either @xmath63 or @xmath53 is reduced , i.e.  whenever the matrix - element divergence is made stronger .",
    "however it also becomes smaller when @xmath52 is reduced , even though a modification of @xmath52 has no effect on the divergence of the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ eq : soft - col - mat ] ) . the undesirable consequence of this is that the jade algorithm strongly ` prefers ' to recombine pairs of soft particles at large relative angle , instead of combining the individual soft particles with any collinear but harder neighbours , and so ` pulls ' particles out of their natural jet .    from this brief discussion",
    ", one can see that the distance measure should satisfy two main characteristics : ( a ) two particles should be considered close when there is a corresponding divergence in their matrix elements ; and ( b ) the measure should not inadvertently introduce ` spurious ' extra closeness for a variation of the momenta that does not lead to any extra divergence ( see however discussion below eq .  ) .    for generic hadron - level jet studies",
    "the durham measure eq .",
    "( [ eq : yij ] ) is a good choice because the majority of emissions are gluons  the correct matrix element to consider in the design of the measure is that for soft gluon emission ( be it from a quark or a gluon ) and it always has both a soft ( energy ) and collinear ( angular ) divergence . for flavour algorithms one should remember that the matrix elements for @xmath64 or @xmath65 ( with a soft quark ) have no soft divergence , but just the collinear divergence , @xmath66 |m^2_{g\\to q_i\\bar q_j}(k_j)| \\simeq \\frac{{\\alpha_s}{t_r}}{2\\pi }    \\frac{de_j}{e_i }     \\frac{d\\theta_{ij}^2}{\\theta_{ij}^2}\\,,\\qquad\\quad ( e_j \\ll e_i\\ , , \\;\\ ,    \\theta_{ij } \\ll 1)\\,,\\ ] ] ( note the index @xmath49 in the energy denominator ) and analogously for @xmath67 . with the @xmath48 measure , eq .",
    "( [ eq : yij ] ) , a branching that produces a soft quark , @xmath60 , has the same closeness as in the case of the gluon  however this closeness is now spurious because , in contrast to the gluon - emission case , there is no divergence for @xmath68 .",
    "the replacement of the @xmath63 denominator in the gluon - emission case , eq .  ( [ eq : soft - col - mat ] ) , with @xmath52 in the ` soft - quark ' emission case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : soft - col - mat - g2qq ] ) , suggests that the closeness measure for soft @xmath69 branching should become @xmath70 .",
    "a similar argument holds in the case of @xmath71 with @xmath60 .",
    "thus we should use a distance measure that depends on the flavours of the particles being considered : @xmath72{ll }        \\max(e_i^2 , e_j^2)\\ , , & \\quad\\mbox{softer of $ i , j$ is flavoured,}\\\\        \\min(e_i^2 , e_j^2)\\ , , & \\quad\\mbox{softer of $ i , j$ is flavourless , }      \\end{array }    \\right.\\ ] ] where the softer of @xmath41 is the one with the smaller energy and where we use the terms flavoured and flavourless rather than quark - like and gluon - like so as to allow also for situations with diquarks or other multi - flavoured objects . with eq .",
    "( [ eq : yij - flavour ] ) soft - quark ` emission ' leads to no smaller a distance measure than non - soft quark emission , in accord with the absence of a soft divergence for quark emission . furthermore if a quark is to recombine with a harder particle it will favour one that is not too hard , in accord with the presence of @xmath73 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : soft - col - mat - g2qq ] ) , which implies that the harder the parent , the less likely it is that it will produce a quark of a given softness .",
    "with such a distance measure , for configurations as in figure  [ fig : badjets ] the soft @xmath31 and @xmath32 will have similar energies , @xmath74 .",
    "thus @xmath75 , whereas @xmath76 .",
    "so independently of the precise ( large ) angles of the soft @xmath77 pair , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , it is that soft pair that will recombine first to give a gluon - like pseudo - jet @xmath80 .",
    "this will have @xmath81 and now the soft gluon pseudo - jet will recombine with either @xmath82 or @xmath10 ( which one depends on the angles ) and the net flavour of the hard particles will remain unchanged . therefore , at order @xmath36 , our new measure correctly eliminates the soft flavour - changing divergence that exists for the plain durham algorithm .    sometimes in the above algorithm",
    "a quark can be recombined with another quark or with an antiquark of a different flavour .",
    "this can happen for example if there are two large - angle @xmath77 pairs .",
    "as long as the resulting ` doubly - flavoured ' object is treated in the same way as a quark in the definition of @xmath83 , the algorithm will remain infrared safe , because in the subsequent clustering steps there will be a strong preference for recombining the multiply - flavoured object with other objects of similar softness , until all soft large - angle multiply - flavoured objects combine between themselves to produce gluon - like objects ( these then recombine normally with the hard partons ) .",
    "one may wish to avoid the appearance of multiply - flavour pseudo - jets altogether , since they can not be associated with qcd partons .",
    "this can be achieved by vetoing any recombination that would lead to a multiply - flavoured object , i.e.  by replacing step @xmath10 with    1 .",
    "find the specific @xmath49 and @xmath50 that correspond to the smallest @xmath83 among those combinations of @xmath49 and @xmath50 whose net flavour corresponds either to an ( anti)quark or a gluon , and recombine them .",
    "we call this a ` bland ' variant of the jet - flavour algorithm , since ` excessively flavoured ' clusterings are forbidden .",
    "we note that a blandness requirement on clusterings has been discussed also in @xcite ( though a simple ` bland ' durham algorithm with the standard @xmath84 remains infrared unsafe ) .",
    "an interesting question is that of how much freedom exists in the definition of the distance measure for a flavour algorithm .",
    "returning to the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig : badjets ] the main requirement for infrared flavour safety is that the soft fermions @xmath78 and @xmath79 should recombine between themselves before recombining with harder particles .",
    "this property is maintained for the following _ class _ of distance measures , @xmath85{ll }        [ \\min(e_i , e_j)]^{2-\\alpha } [ \\max(e_i , e_j)]^{\\alpha}\\ , , &          \\quad\\mbox{softer of $ i , j$ is flavoured,}\\\\        \\min(e_i^2 , e_j^2)\\ , , & \\quad\\mbox{softer of $ i , j$ is flavourless , }      \\end{array }    \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is a continuous parameter in the range @xmath87 ( so far we have implicitly discussed @xmath88 ) . above",
    ", we stated the requirement that the distance measure should not introduce ` spurious ' extra closeness for a variation of the momenta that does not lead to any extra divergence . here",
    "though , for @xmath89 such a spurious extra closeness is present .",
    "infrared flavour safety is nevertheless preserved , because the extra closeness is _ weaker _ than that that arises in the case of a divergence , i.e.  for a soft gluon @xmath50 , @xmath90 vanishes as @xmath91 , whereas for a soft quark @xmath50 it only vanishes as @xmath92 .",
    "naively it would seem that @xmath88 should give the best identification of flavour .",
    "however there are situations where a hard quark loses energy through multiple collinear gluon emission and thus becomes a relatively soft quark . in principle",
    "there are no large ratios between the quark energy and the softest of the harder gluons it has emitted .",
    "however if that gluon is a bit harder than the quark , a value of @xmath93 can make it easier for them to recombine .",
    "accordingly below we shall examine both @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "events that after jet clustering have their flavour badly identified , i.e.  identified as consisting of two gluon jets ( that is , each of zero net flavour ) or two jets each of net flavour larger than 1 ; the coefficient of @xmath96 , as generated with event2 @xcite , is plotted as a function of the durham @xmath97 three - jet resolution threshold ; results are shown for the durham and flavour algorithms ( for two values of @xmath86).,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    a rigorous test of jet flavour algorithms can be obtained by numerically investigating the infrared safety of the jet flavour in fixed - order calculations .",
    "for example , one generates events @xmath98 together with higher orders and clusters them to two jets . with a jet algorithm that provides a good reconstruction of the flavour",
    ", one expects that each of the two jets should have net flavour corresponding to an ( anti)quark .",
    "sometimes this does not happen  for example each of the two jets may have no net flavour , i.e.  be gluon - like .",
    "this is legitimate in events in which there has been a hard branching ( there is not a unique clustering to two jets ) , but for an infrared safe flavour jet algorithm , the probability of this happening should vanish in the limit in which there are only soft and collinear emissions .    to measure the hardness of a given event we use @xmath99 , the threshold value of the durham jet - resolution below which",
    "the event is clustered to three jets of more .",
    "figure  [ fig : event2 ] shows the differential cross section at next - to - leading order ( nlo , order @xmath36 ) for producing events in which the flavour of the two jets is badly identified .",
    "it has been obtained with event2  @xcite , to our knowledge the only nlo code that provides information on the flavour of the final - state partons .",
    "one sees that for the durham algorithm the differential cross section for events whose jet flavour does not corresponds to @xmath15 goes to a constant as @xmath100 goes to @xmath101 . this is the sign of the infrared unsafety of flavour identification in the durham jet algorithm .",
    "in contrast , in our flavour algorithms ( for both values of @xmath86 ) the corresponding cross section vanishes for @xmath102 .",
    "detailed examination of the events with badly identified flavour at small @xmath99 reveals that one of the ( anti)quarks has lost nearly all of its energy to a hard splitting and goes into the same hemisphere as the other quark , i.e.  identification of the event as consisting of two gluon jets is actually legitimate .",
    "such configurations appear at order @xmath35 where their cross section is @xmath103 . at nlo ,",
    "sudakov suppression of an extra soft gluon leads to a contribution @xmath104 which is found to be consistent with the observed numerical results , thus confirming the interpretation given above for the origin of the small fraction of @xmath105-like events at small @xmath99 .",
    "given that one of the possible applications of jet flavour algorithms is in the merging of matrix - element and parton - shower calculations , we also wish to examine how flavour algorithms behave for monte - carlo generated parton - level ensembles of quarks and gluons .",
    "this is interesting for various other reasons too : monte carlo generators produce multiple soft and collinear gluon emissions and @xmath69 splittings , so they are more likely to ` stress - test ' a jet flavour algorithm ; also we can study a much wider variety of processes with them  for example one can simulate a fake @xmath106 to examine jet flavour algorithms in a simple gluonic context ; one can also easily use them for studies of hadron - hadron events ( next section ) where currently none of the nlo programs gives direct access to information on the flavour of the outgoing partons .",
    "while monte carlo event generators provide considerable flexibility , it can be difficult to interpret their results .",
    "for example infrared unsafety of the flavour in fixed - order programs manifests itself as a non - vanishing probability of misidentification of the flavour as @xmath107 . with an event generator one",
    "is instead likely to see this probability vanishing with an anomalous dimension , e.g.  @xmath108 where @xmath109 is some coefficient ( assuming , for the purpose of the discussion , fixed coupling ) .    for an infrared safe jet flavour",
    "one expects that for the clustered jets to have a different flavour from the born channel there should have been a hard branching , as in the discussion above for the nlo @xmath38 calculation .",
    "this would lead to flavour misidentification vanishing as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is some pure number ( above , @xmath112 ) .",
    "this too may however be modified by an anomalous dimension , becoming for example @xmath113 where @xmath114 is some further pure number .",
    "quark production in parton distribution functions , known to be enhanced by an all - order double logarithmic series @xcite .",
    "such a series might also appear in the jet - flavour case , leading to a more complex modification of the naive @xmath110 behaviour than stated in the main text . ]    in the presence of anomalous dimensions it is difficult to establish from monte carlo events exactly which functional form one is seeing .",
    "yet another complication is that monte carlo event generators often do not contain the full structure of soft large - angle divergences , so that in any case the anomalous dimensions observed may not correspond to the true ones .",
    "jet resolution threshold ; a large value of @xmath54 has been chosen for illustrational purposes , so as to provide a correspondingly large range in @xmath99 ; the left - hand plot shows results for @xmath115 , while the right - hand plot shows fake `` @xmath106 '' process as generated by herwig ( code=107).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]   jet resolution threshold ; a large value of @xmath54 has been chosen for illustrational purposes , so as to provide a correspondingly large range in @xmath99 ; the left - hand plot shows results for @xmath115 , while the right - hand plot shows fake `` @xmath106 '' process as generated by herwig ( code=107).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    despite these complications , for an infrared safe jet flavour algorithm one expects flavour misidentification to vanish visibly faster as @xmath107 than for the infrared unsafe case .",
    "this signal can be made clearer by going to large @xmath54 so as to have access to a large range in @xmath99 ( note though that a large value of @xmath54 also ` stresses ' the jet flavour algorithm , since it increases the phase space for extra soft @xmath15 production ) . figure  [ fig : herwig - ee2xx ] ( left ) shows the fraction of events , for each @xmath99 value , where the flavour has been misidentified in various jet algorithms .",

    "all the flavour algorithms behave similarly .",

    "this situation changes in the right - hand plot of figure  [ fig : herwig - ee2xx ] , where we consider fake @xmath106 events . here",
    "the bland durham algorithm behaves almost identically to the normal durham algorithm .",
    "this is expected , since a soft @xmath119 pair encounters no blandness problems when contaminating the flavour of gluon jets .",
    "the flavour algorithms all work systematically better than the durham - based algorithms , clearly vanishing faster with @xmath99 .",
    "one sees differences in normalisation between the different flavour algorithms and the blandness requirement provides a non - negligible advantage , especially for @xmath88 .",
    "this implies that the flavour misidentification involves more than one @xmath120 pair .",
    "nevertheless , the algorithm remains infrared safe even for multiple soft or collinear @xmath119 pairs , as discussed above pairs , spread densely in rapidity from large - angles all the way to the hard - fragmentation region can lead to a systematic worsening of the flavour identification . ]",
    "( see also the appendix for a more general outline of the discussion of ir safety ) .",
    "for hadron - hadron collisions ( and dis ) the @xmath0 jet algorithm is similar to that described in section  [ sec : k_t - flav - algor ] , with a few modifications in the definition of the distances @xcite . given that there is no unique hard scale @xmath54 , instead of examining dimensionless @xmath90 s one looks at dimensionful @xmath121 s .",

    "this eliminates the potentially dangerous situation that would otherwise occur , in which first the @xmath31 recombines with one beam and then the @xmath32 recombines with the other beam .",
    "therefore it is not just the flavours of the outgoing jets that are infrared and collinear safe , but also those of the incoming beam jets ( the determination the beam - jet flavours of course also requires knowledge of the incoming parton flavours ) .",
    "a concrete demonstration of the infrared safety of the hadron - hadron algorithms , analogous to figure  [ fig : event2 ] for @xmath38 , is not possible with currently available tools , because none of the higher - order nlo jet codes @xcite provide direct access to information about final - state flavour .",
    "even if they did , there would be an additional complication compared to @xmath38 . in @xmath38 at born level , there is only one flavour channel , i.e.  @xmath178 .",

    ". therefore the bland algorithm actually has an extra source of infrared - collinear flavour unsafety relative to the plain @xmath0 algorithm .",
    "] this is similar to what was observed for @xmath38 in section  [ sec : k_t - flav - algor ] , and is a sign of the infrared safety of the flavour algorithms .",
    "one notes that for all algorithms the fall - off is less rapid in the hadron - hadron case than in @xmath38 .",
    "this is natural given the increased number of jets and therefore of sources of radiation which can lead to extra flavour in the final state .",
    "another difference compared to @xmath38 is that now the @xmath94 flavour algorithms sometimes fare better than the @xmath88 case .",
    "this is not systematic and also depends on the monte carlo program used to generate events ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : hhxx2yy]c and [ fig : hhxx2yy]d ) .",
    "the overall normalisation of the curves also depends on the monte carlo program used and one sees that pythia with transverse - momentum ordered showers produces parton - level final states in which it is systematically harder to cluster back to the original flavour .",
    "we have shown in this article that it is possible to define parton - level jets in a manner that ensures that their flavour is infrared safe .",
    "the key ingredient in doing this was a modification of the @xmath0 distance measure , inspired by the different structures of divergences that appear in quark production and gluon production . in the case of hadron - hadron collisions it was also necessary to introduce the concept of a hardness associated with the beam at any given point in rapidity . where possible , explicit nlo verifications confirm the infrared safety of the new ` flavour ' jet algorithms .",
    "parton - level monte carlo studies also indicate a significant improvement in the identification of flavour relative to the @xmath0 algorithm .    to make use of our new algorithms to accurately study jet flavour , it is necessary to have access to information about the flavour of final - state partons in nlo jet codes .",
    "currently however , most nlo jet codes have been designed assuming that the user has no need for information about final - state parton flavour ( an exception is event2 @xcite ) . in light of the developments presented here , we look forward to flavour information being made available in the future ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    our original motivation for studying the problem of jet flavour was the need to accurately combine resummed predictions for hadron - collider dijet event shapes @xcite with corresponding fixed - order predictions @xcite .",
    "another simple flavour - related study would be the investigation of how the relative fractions of quark and gluon jets at hadron colliders are modified by nlo corrections and how they vary with jet transverse momentum .",
    "apart from its intrinsic interest , such information could be of relevance also to the tuning of monte carlo event generators and studies of hadron multiplicities in jets , both of which are sensitive to the proportions of quark and gluon jets .",
    "one drawback of the algorithms presented here is that , when considering light flavours , they can only be applied to partonic and not hadronic events .",
    "this is because at each recombination they require knowledge of which objects are flavoured ( quark - like ) rather than flavourless ( gluon - like ) and that information is not present in hadronic final states .. it would be interesting to find a jet algorithm based purely on particle momenta , that nevertheless provides a good infrared - safe determination of the flavour at parton level .",
    "it is not clear to what extent this is possible . at @xmath202 .",
    "however it has numerous other drawbacks , which we suspect are part of the reason why in monte carlo studies we find that its flavour identification properties are no better than those of the ( flavour ) infrared unsafe durham algorithm .",
    "] there is nevertheless one hadron - level context in which this article s flavour algorithms could be used directly , that is for heavy - quark jets  @xcite .",
    "currently a heavy - quark jet is defined as a jet containing one or more heavy quarks ( or heavy - quark hadrons ) .",
    "the fraction of jets of transverse energy @xmath203 containing a heavy quark of mass @xmath204 is enhanced by terms @xmath205 for @xmath206 , due to the large multiplicity @xmath207 of gluons above scale @xmath204 , combined with the possibility that they split collinearly @xmath208 , responsible for a further factor @xmath209 @xcite .",
    "therefore , at high @xmath203 the majority of so - called heavy - quark jets are not jets induced by a heavy quark , but rather jets in which a heavy quark has appeared from the internal branching in the jet .",
    "this implies that the current definition of heavy - quark jet will lead to large qcd backgrounds in searches for new particles which aim to tag an ` intrinsic ' heavy quark jet among the decay products of the new particle .",
    "an alternative approach to the study of heavy quark jets would be to consider the _ net",
    "_ heavy flavour of jets , pairs @xcite . ]",
    "i.e.  the number of heavy quark hadrons minus heavy antiquark hadrons in a given jet . with the cone or @xmath0 algorithms such a definition would eliminate nearly all the final - state logarithmically enhanced terms , leaving just @xmath210 contributions ( involving a final - state bfkl - type resummation @xcite ) .",
    "these remaining terms come from the same diagrams that led to the infrared unsafety of light flavour of a jet .",
    "they can therefore be eliminated altogether by applying our flavour jet algorithm with the minor modification that every occurrence of `` flavour '' is to be replaced with `` heavy flavour '' . in this way it becomes possible to give meaning to a concept of intrinsic heavy flavour , i.e.  heavy flavour that originates exclusively from the heavy - flavour component of parton distribution functions , from hard qcd flavour `` creation '' ( e.g.  @xmath211 ) and from the decay of other heavier particles .",

    "it will be framed in the context of @xmath38 collisions , and then in closing we will briefly mention hadronic collisions .    for a general discussion of the infrared and collinear safety of flavour one needs to examine all divergent cases",
    "in which flavour is either produced or moved from one part of the event to another .",
    "production of flavour arises from gluon splitting .",
    "this has just a collinear divergence ; additionally the gluon itself has soft and collinear divergences with respect to other quarks and gluons .",
    "flavour can ` move ' during the branching process when a quark recoils due to emission of a gluon of similar hardness to the quark .",
    "this has no divergences , but there may be divergences associated with the original production of the quark itself .",
    "flavour can also move during the jet - clustering procedure whenever a quark recombines with a parton that is not collinear to it and whose momentum is of the same order of magnitude as ( or larger than ) the quark .",
    "let us first consider flavour production by collinear splitting of a gluon .",
    "the durham algorithm always recombines collinear particles into the same jet . since in @xmath69",
    "splitting there is no soft divergence , the @xmath31 and @xmath32 have commensurate hardnesses .",
    "therefore the ` flavour ' distance measure eq .",
    "( [ eq : yij - flavour ] ) is of the same order of magnitude as the durham distance measure and so the @xmath15 from a collinear splitting of a gluon will end up in the same jet also in the flavour algorithm , leaving the jet flavour unchanged as is required for irc safety of the flavour .",
    "next we consider non - collinear splitting of a gluon into @xmath119 .",
    "this has divergences when the original gluon is collinear to some other parton and/or soft .",
    "if the gluon itself is collinear to some other parton @xmath212 , angle @xmath213 , then the gluon splitting to @xmath119 is strongly suppressed unless @xmath214 , i.e.  non - collinear splitting is not possible from a gluon that is collinear to some other parton .",
    "this is the basis of the widely used angular ordering approximation .",
    "therefore a @xmath119 produced from a collinear ( and optionally soft ) gluon will always recombine , in the flavour algorithm as in the durham algorithm , ensuring the safety of the flavour of any resulting jet .",
    "this leaves the case discussed already in the main text , in which a large - angle @xmath119 pair is produced from a large - angle soft gluon .",
    "we have already presented the arguments that explain the ir unsafety of the durham algorithm in this case and the ir safety of the flavour algorithms .    in generalising the analysis to higher orders one needs also to examine potential ` motion ' of the soft large - angle @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it will be useful to introduce the compact notation @xmath215 for the set of distance measures @xmath216 .",
    "firstly the quark ( or anti - quark ) can itself emit a large - angle gluon of similar softness ( @xmath217 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : badjets - app ] ( left ) .",
    "this will change the direction of the quark ( @xmath30 ) . in the durham algorithm ,",
    "each of the @xmath218 is of the order of the soft gluon @xmath219 , and the recombination sequence depends significantly on the angles . in particular",
    "the emission of @xmath217 from the quark may have moved it further away from the antiquark making it more likely that the soft @xmath15 end up in different jets .",
    "in contrast , in the flavour algorithm @xmath220 are of order @xmath82 , whereas @xmath221 and @xmath222 are of order of the soft gluon @xmath219 .",
    "therefore @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath223 will all recombine together first , or @xmath223 will recombine with the hard jets and then @xmath78 and @xmath79 will recombine together . in both cases",
    "the flavour of the soft quarks is neutralised .",
    "the analysis of the right - hand diagram of figure  [ fig : badjets - app ] is largely similar as long as @xmath217 is at large angles and of the same hardness as @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the additional issue is that now @xmath217 has a collinear divergence with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "one might generally worry that semi - hard radiation collinear to @xmath34 might pull @xmath29 far away from its original direction .",
    "this could happen if @xmath217 is collinear to @xmath34 and if @xmath29 and @xmath217 recombine , with @xmath224 such that the recombination product ends up collinear to @xmath34 .",
    "however if @xmath225 then @xmath226 and the @xmath29@xmath30 will recombine first , neutralising the flavour . note that if @xmath227 and @xmath217 is collinear to @xmath34 then the @xmath228 recombination will occur first , leaving the usual ( safe ) configuration consisting of a soft @xmath15 pair .",
    "one can straightforwardly extend this analysis to multiple @xmath15 pairs and multiple gluons .",
    "the originally soft large - angle quark can be dragged further and further towards the hard jet in ensembles with multiple gluons of similar @xmath0 s but successively larger ( but not strongly ordered ) energies .",
    "however , given any fixed number of recombinations , in the soft limit the resulting quark - like object always has energy @xmath229 and will recombine with the soft antiquark rather than with the hard particles .",
    "a final comment concerns hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "there , the beam jets have a hardness @xmath134 , which is of the same order of magnitude as any hard final - state jets that might have been emitted at the rapidity @xmath156 .",
    "therefore there is no difference from the point of view of irc safety between recombination into final - state jets and into beam jets and all the arguments given here apply equally well in the hadron - hadron context .",
    "it would be excessive to cite them all here .",
    "instead the reader may examine them by submitting the spires search `` ` find t jet # and ( t quark or t gluon ) ` '' and then extracting from the results only those articles whose title contains `` quark jet(s ) '' or `` gluon jet(s ) '' .",
