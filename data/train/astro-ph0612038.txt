    "early work on x - ray emission from clusters of galaxies , based on x - ray data obtained with instruments of modest angular and spectral resolution , implied that the profiles of x - ray emission are smooth and that the spectra can be adequately described as nearly isothermal hot plasma , generally indicating relaxed structure .",
    "this picture has changed markedly with precise imaging data from the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ instruments : x - ray images of clusters reveal complex intensity distributions , where in general , the surface brightness lacks circular symmetry .",
    "the cluster emission can not be described by a single- temperature plasma .",
    "neither is the distribution of temperatures spherically symmetric , and it can not simply be described as radially dependent ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , simple but well - motivated models such as `` cooling flows '' fail to adequately describe the observations ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) , even for clusters that are otherwise `` relaxed . ''",
    "this is likely due to a complex history and physical processes associated with the cluster formation , which is yet to be fully understood .",
    "such complexity may include effects of recent merger activity ; large - scale `` bubbles , '' presumably due to the interaction of the outflows produced by the central active galaxy ; sharp abundance gradients associated with recently triggered star formation ; or other , still unknown processes @xcite .",
    "clearly , an analysis technique not relying on symmetry of the flux or temperature distribution is needed .",
    "the methods considered for this task include fitting isothermal spectra to fixed or adaptively binned grids of photons across the detector plane ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another approach is imaging deprojection or `` onion - peeling '' methods ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which in turn have been extended to spectroscopic deprojection @xcite .",
    "an alternative method developed recently by some of us and termed `` smoothed particle inference '' or spi ( @xcite ; hereafter pma07 ) relies on a description of a cluster as a large set of `` primitives , '' which in our case are smoothed particles , or `` blobs . '' each of those is described by its overall luminosity and a spatial position , but also by a gaussian width , a single temperature , and a set of elemental abundances . a large set ( well upward of a hundred ) of such primitives",
    "is then propagated through the instrument response using monte carlo ( mc ) techniques , and their parameters are adjusted via the use of markov chain methods to map out the likelihood of the distribution as compared to the observation .",
    "the resulting distribution is then a good `` nonparametric '' description of the cluster .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the implementation of this method to observations obtained with the _ xmm - newton _ imaging detectors known collectively as the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) .",
    "we apply the method to data from three clusters of galaxies , namely abell 1689 , rx j0658 - 55 , and the centaurus cluster .",
    "all three clusters exhibit a substantial degree of complexity , and furthermore , all three have good - quality , deep _ xmm - newton _ observations , which in turn can be compared against previous x - ray analyses as well as data from other instruments , such as the _ chandra _ observatory .",
    "in particular , abell 1689 is likely a merger or a superposition of two components aligned close to the line of sight ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; rx j0658 - 55 reveals an ongoing merger close to the plane of the sky @xcite ; and the centaurus cluster shows abundance gradients as well as filaments and bubbles , presumably caused by the energy deposited in the cluster by the central radio source @xcite . the choice of objects should provide a good illustration ( or test ) of the method for three quite different cases",
    "to perform this analysis , we constructed a monte carlo for the _ xmm - newton _ epic detectors that is analogous to the mc that some of us developed for the reflecting grating spectrometer ( rgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , here we use the new markov chain - based method , spi , for parameter iteration , as described above .",
    "below , in section 2 , we describe the previous and current observations of the three clusters and summarize the data reduction procedures . in section 3 ,",
    "we summarize the spi method and describe the specifics of the _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic response function used here .",
    "we also describe the application of the method to the data . in section 4",
    "we discuss the results of the analysis , including the spatially resolved maps of the spectral parameters . in section 5 we summarize the paper and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the method and , finally , we discuss the future applications of the method in section 6 .",
    "here we describe the choice of targets selected to demonstrate the capabilities and versatility of our method .",
    "the three chosen targets span a broad range of complexity of the flux , temperature , and redshift .",
    "note that the exact same analysis chain is applied to all objects .",
    "this cluster is one of the objects most studied with gravitational lensing techniques , as the optical images clearly reveal arcs and arclets , allowing strong - lensing analysis @xcite .",
    "deep studies with the eso mpg wide field imager provide additional constraints towards the determination of the cluster gravitational potential , via the use of weak lensing @xcite .",
    "more recently , the mass profile has been detailed further with combined strong and weak lensing , using _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ acs and subaru images @xcite .",
    "the optical data ( including studies of galaxy velocities ) indicate that the cluster contains sub - structures @xcite .",
    "the early x - ray data for this cluster indicated an x - ray intensity profile that implied a single , relaxed system , but the mass determination from the x - ray analysis indicated a lower mass ( by about a factor of 2 ) than the mass value determined from lensing ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ observation used in this paper , but using more traditional techniques than the spi method , was presented by @xcite , and we refer the reader to that paper for more extensive discussion of abell 1689 s properties as well as previous x - ray observations . in summary , the x - ray emission appears to be symmetric , and the average temperature inferred for the region of 3@xmath0 in radius is @xmath1 kev , assuming the value of the galactic column of @xmath2 @xmath3 derived by @xcite .",
    "however , the spatial analysis indicates that the temperature of the emitting plasma is clearly not uniform , ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 kev , with a hint of a temperature gradient in the southwest - northeast direction .",
    "in addition , the redshift of the emitting gas as inferred from the x - ray spectrum varies across the image , with a high - redshift structure to the east , with @xmath6 , separated from the rest of the cluster at @xmath7 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the cluster consists of two components in projection , which either have started to merge , or are falling towards each other .",
    "one of the premises of our study is to determine if the two sub - components are indeed related , or if they should be treated as two separate clusters that happen to be located close to the same line of sight in the sky and are observed in projection against each other .",
    "rx j0658 - 5557 ( or 1es 0657 - 55.8 ) , at @xmath8 was first discovered as an extended x - ray source by the _ einstein _",
    "ipc @xcite and was later found from _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) _ data @xcite to have a temperature of about 17 kev , although subsequent simultaneous analysis of _ asca _ and _ rosat _ pspc data by @xcite suggested a lower value of @xmath9 kev .",
    "still , even the revised value of the temperature makes it one of the hottest known clusters . the disturbed profile of the x - ray emission seen in the _ rosat _ observation suggests an ongoing merger @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is associated with a powerful radio halo @xcite , probably radiating via the synchrotron process , which suggests the presence of a population of ultra - relativistic particles .",
    "rx j0658 - 5557 was first observed by _",
    "chandra _ in 2000 october with 24.3 ks of usable data @xcite , and now has a total of over 500 ks of _ chandra _ exposure clearly revealing the bow shock in front of the `` bullet '' emerging from the merger .",
    "the collision is clearly supersonic , with a mach number of 3 deduced from the angle of the mach cone .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _",
    "data for the cluster have been analyzed previously in @xcite and @xcite , who find an average temperature of @xmath10 kev , using data in the 2 - 12 kev range and fixing @xmath11 to the galactic value of @xmath12 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the _ xmm - newton _ data have been used in joint spectral fits with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ data ( in the context of the search for hard x - ray emission ) by @xcite , where the hard x - ray flux would be by compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background by the same relativistic particles that are responsible for the radio emission . in their analysis , @xcite use mos and pn data in the range 1.0 - 10.0 kev , and , adopting the absorbing column to be that measured for our galaxy of @xmath13 @xmath3 by @xcite , they infer an average temperature for the region within a 4@xmath0 radius of @xmath14 kev , in marginal agreement with that determined by @xcite , with the difference probably being due to the use of different bandpasses , calibration files , and the assumed absorbing column density .",
    "similarly to abell 1689 , the spatial structure of the gravitational potential in this cluster has been extensively studied using both strong and weak gravitational lensing .",
    "weak - lensing analysis by @xcite and , more recently , joint weak- and strong- lensing analysis by @xcite and @xcite , reveals a striking offset between the peaks in the gravitating material and x - ray - luminous matter .",
    "this suggests a scenario in which the subclusters have collided head - on and the gas is being slowed down by ram pressure , while the dark matter is able to pass through more or less without resistance . as such",
    ", this cluster offers one of the most compelling arguments for dark matter , which interacts only via gravitation , being distinct from the baryonic material , which is responsible for the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the centaurus cluster , also known as abell 3526 , is one of the most nearby clusters , and because of this , it enables good spatially resolved studies of cluster structure .",
    "it is a relatively cool cluster , at an average temperature of @xmath15 kev @xcite , with a modest luminosity .",
    "one of its distinguishing characteristics is the detection of spatially resolved gradients of elemental abundances , even with data of modest angular resolution ( see , e.g. , fukazawa et al . 1994 , 1998 ) .",
    "this , as well as a wide distribution of temperatures of the emitting plasma , is clear in the _ chandra _ data @xcite , where the x - ray image shows a `` swirl '' in the central structure , with a filament extending towards the north - east .",
    "this feature could have been shaped by a strong magnetic field or a bulk flow within the intracluster medium . in @xcite ,",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data are analyzed in combination with the _ chandra _ data in order to derive maps of abundances for separate elements .",
    "they find that the element ratios are consistent with the solar ratios , with a metallicity of up to twice the solar value . a recent observation using the xis detector ( the x - ray imaging spectrometer ) aboard the _ suzaku _",
    "satellite finds no evidence for bulk motion of the cluster gas and put an upper limit of @xmath16 km s@xmath17 on any line - of - sight velocity difference @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced using standard pipeline processing as of _ xmm - newton _ ` sas ` version 6.5 producing photon event lists . for the screening of soft proton flares , we create light curves in the 10 - 12 kev band for mos and in the 12 - 14 kev band for pn in 100 s bins .",
    "we discarded the data when the total flux reached @xmath18 above the quiescent level ( cf .",
    "after this cut , we perform a similar second cut on the soft flux light curves in the 0.3 - 10 kev band for mos and the 0.3 - 12 kev band for pn , binned by 10s .",
    "we use all event patterns ( singles , doubles , triples and quadruples ) for mos and singles and doubles only for pn .",
    "we also require ` xmmea_em ` for mos and ` xmmea_ep ` for pn , and also ` flag`=0 .",
    "the resulting effective exposure times and gross count rates in the @xmath19kev band for the three observations are shown in table [ obstab ] .",

    "finally , the centaurus observation was collected on 2002 january 3 and is the same as the one used by @xcite .    using the sas command ` eexpmap ` , we create exposure maps with @xmath20 bins in detector coordinates for all detectors . these account for bad pixels and columns in the data and correct for varying exposure over the ccds .",
    "the method of smoothed particle inference ( spi ) , which was constructed to model diffuse x - ray - emitting astrophysical sources , is described in pma07 . here",
    "we only give a brief summary of the basic features of the method .    in order to describe currently observed diffuse x - ray sources , a model with thousands of parameters",
    "is required .",
    "our choice of model is a set of spatially gaussian x - ray emitters of an assigned spectral type .",
    "each gaussian `` blob '' is described by a spatial position , a gaussian width , and a set of spectral parameters .    in the monte carlo simulation ,",
    "the flux of the astrophysical source at each energy and spatial position is converted to a prediction of the number of photons detected at a given detector position and energy .",

    "this integral is calculated by simulating photons sequentially while taking into account mirror and detector characteristics ( described in the next section , 3.2 ) .",
    "the goodness of fit of the model is calculated from the likelihood function of the model parameters .",
    "the model data consist of a finite number of simulated photons , and we use a two - sample likelihood statistic to assess the goodness of fit .",
    "we explore the parameter space of the model with the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "the high dimensionality of the parameter space requires a method that is capable of exploring this space without being trapped in local minima .",
    "the markov chain step is gaussian , with a width that varies depending on parameter history .",
    "we also find it necessary to make some parameters coupled .",
    "these are the same for all particles ( global ) and vary simultaneously .",
    "the esa _ xmm - newton _ satellite consists of three co - aligned x - ray telescopes and an optical / uv telescope @xcite .",
    "the telescopes focus x - rays onto two reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs ) and onto three ccd arrays for imaging spectroscopy : mos1 , mos2 and pn .",
    "the imaging detectors are collectively referred to as the european photon imaging camera ( epic , * ? ? ?",
    "the full details of epic are covered in @xcite , and its latest calibration is described in @xcite .",
    "this section briefly describes the epic response function as calculated by us using the _ xmm - newton _ current calibration files ( ccf ) library and explains how it is used in the monte carlo .",
    "a detailed description of the response calculation and interpolation is described in @xcite for the _ xmm - newton _ rgs monte carlo .",
    "f or epic the detector response is different in structure , but the monte carlo process is the same .    in summary , the response probability function of the epic cameras can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mirror effective area , @xmath31 is the mirror vignetting , psf@xmath32 is the energy - dependent point - spread function ( psf ) , @xmath33 is the reflection grating array ( rga ) vignetting , @xmath34 is the filter transmission , @xmath35 is the quantum efficiency , @xmath36 is the pulse - height response , and @xmath37 is an exposure map correcting for bad pixels and differences in exposure time between different ccds .",
    "this function gives the probability of detecting a photon of energy @xmath28 originating at sky coordinates @xmath27 as an event of pulse height @xmath26 at detector coordinates @xmath25 .",
    "the details of these parts of the detector response are given below .",
    "+ * effective area and vignetting : * the effective mirror collection area of the xmm mirrors is a function of energy and decreases with off - axis angle .",
    "this decrease is known as vignetting and is caused by shadowing from neighboring mirror shells .",
    "we obtain the on - axis effective area @xmath30 and the vignetting @xmath31 for each telescope from the xmm calibration files .",
    "the response files are interpolated linearly and rebinned in order to optimize the performance of the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the bin size for @xmath30 is set to 50 ev , ranging from 0 to 10.45 kev .",

    "* point - spread function : * we use a circular symmetric approximation for the psf as it is described in the calibration files . for on - axis extended sources of @xmath39 in radial extent , this is a sufficient approximation for our purposes . here",
    "we approximate the psf by use of the encircled energy for different photon energies available from the ccf .",
    "we use encircled energy samplings for photon energies from 0 to 9 kev with a 1.5 kev spacing . for each energy band",

    "rga vignetting : * in the mos cameras a fraction of the photons are intercepted by the rga with some energy dependence .",
    "this loss of photons for mos1 and mos2 is tabulated in the calibration files . in our monte carlo model",
    ", we use a sampling of this energy dependence of 0.5 kev .",
    "* filter transmission : * the transmission of the optical blocking filters aboard _",
    "xmm - newton _ is modeled for the thin , medium and thick filter configurations as a function of energy .",

    "* quantum efficiency : * the ability of the detector ccds to detect photons as a function of energy , or quantum efficiency ( qe ) , is tabulated in the ccf response files .",
    "we rebin the quantum efficiency for the full frame mode for mos and both the full frame and extended full frame modes for pn .",

    "* pulse height redistribution function : * epic pn response matrices are available from the _ xmm - newton _ sas web site . in the pn detector , the ccd response of the 12 ccds varies with the distance from the line separating the two ccd rows .",
    "the pn response matrices are available for every 20 pixel rows from rows 0 - 20 ( y0 , at the edge ) to rows 181 - 200 ( y9 , at the center ) . in the monte carlo simulation",
    ", we calculate the distance from the detector center line and use the correct pn response matrix accordingly .",
    "we only use matrices for the full frame and extended full frame observing modes , and only for event patterns 0 - 4 ( singles and doubles ) for pn .",
    "epic mos response matrices are dependent on the observing epoch and should be chosen according to the satellite revolution when the observation was taken .",
    "we use the sas command ` rmfgen ` to generate mos response matrices for 14 different epochs from revolution 101 to revolution 1021 . in the monte carlo",
    "we choose whichever epoch is closest to the observation .",
    "for mos we use imaging mode matrices with all event patterns ( 0 - 12 ; singles , doubles , triples and quadruples ) .",
    "recently , it has been discovered that the mos response is also dependent on distance from the detector axis ( see the _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic response and background file page , update 2005 - 12 - 15 ) . in the xmm ccfs ,",
    "the response is modeled in three different regions : a `` patch , '' `` patch wings , '' and outside `` patch . ''",
    "therefore , we also generate response matrices for all three regions for each epoch . in the mc simulation",
    "all three are read in for the epoch in question , and the correct one is chosen on the basis of the location of the detected photon .",
    "the pn response matrices are rebinned to an @xmath42 matrix with a constant 15 ev binsize from 0.05 to 12.05 kev for both energy and pulseheight .",
    "mos matrices have a 15 ev binsize and run from 0 to 12 kev .",
    "these matrices are integrated over pulseheight to form cumulative distributions .      in the monte carlo ,",
    "photons are generated via probability density functions normalized to unity .",
    "we calculate the cumulative distribution by integrating the probability functions and then draw a number from 0 to 1 at random to choose a particular photon property .",
    "first , photons are chosen from a model function with a given set of input model parameters .",
    "the output variables are the photon energy and sky coordinates @xmath43 .",
    "second , we predict the detector coordinates and pulseheight @xmath44 by drawing photons using a response function @xmath22 . in order to maintain the proper effective area and exposure normalization ,",
    "photons are sometimes discarded according to the proper response functions ( i.e. mirror effective area , filter transmission , vignetting , quantum efficiency , and exposure map ) .",
    "the response functions in equation ( [ responsefunc ] ) are in general not analytic and have to be stored in memory on grids . in order to limit the amount of used internal memory .",
    "we save the functions on coarse grids and interpolate linearly to get intermediate values .        in the framework of spi ,",
    "a three - dimensional adaptive binning technique is used to bin the photon event lists .",
    "the details of this are described in pma07 .",
    "the bins are rectangular in shape and are created so that each bin with 20 photons or more is split in two starting out from the entire dataspace .",
    "the choice of which dimension ( @xmath45,@xmath46 or pulse height ) should be split is random , with a possibility to split one dimension more often , on average , than another .",
    "here we choose to split the pulseheight dimension on average 10 times more often than the @xmath45 and @xmath46 dimensions .",
    "this results in three - dimensional bins that are fine in pulseheight and coarse in @xmath45 and @xmath46 , suitable for spatially resolved spectroscopy .",

    "this results in 14361 bins with 13.3 photons bin@xmath17 on average , and for the a1689 data we get 31096 bins which equals 13.5 photons bin@xmath17 on average . for the centaurus data , the binning resulted in 197092 bins with 13.7 photons bin@xmath17 on average .    for analysis",
    ", we use mos data in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev range and pn data in the 1.1 - 10.0 kev range .",
    "the pn low - energy data are cut off due to pn - mos disagreement at low energies ( cf .   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in both analyses",
    "we restrict ourselves to a @xmath48 spatial region centered on the respective cluster centers .",
    "after the model photons have been generated , they are binned on the same grid as the data photons before the two - sample likelihood is calculated .      to model the cluster emission",
    ", we use a multi - component model consisting of spatially gaussian smoothed particles , or `` blobs , '' of cluster emission .",
    "each of these is described by a spatial position , a gaussian width , a single temperature , a set of elemental abundances , and an overall flux . since each particle",
    "is described by a gaussian , there will always be overlapping components .",
    "this means that the model everywhere describes a multi temperature plasma .    in this case",
    "we set the spectral emission model to be described by the mekal @xcite thermal plasma model with solar abundances absorbed by a wabs @xcite absorption model .",
    "the prior ranges for all parameters are set to be flat for a fixed range , except for the spatial gaussian sigma which has a logarithmic prior distribution .",
    "the midpoint of the spectral parameter ranges is determined from simple spectral analysis using the full cluster emission .",
    "the width of the range is chosen from the values that are expected for that parameter in the cluster .",

    "the electronic noise background includes bright pixels and columns , readout noise , etc . , and is modeled as an exponential , @xmath68 , with a variable value of @xmath69 , where @xmath28 is the energy assigned to the noise event .",
    "we find an appropriate value for @xmath69 to be @xmath70 ev when using the mos cutoff at 0.3 kev and the pn cutoff at 1.1 kev .",
    "this value is a fixed parameter in the analysis .",
    "this noise background is assumed to be spatially uniform .",
    "the fraction of photons going to each of these model components ( particle , lines , and noise ) is variable in the analysis and all have a flat prior from 0 to 1 . also , the fraction of photons for each model component going to each detector ( mos1 , mos2 , and pn ) is variable . the total normalization of the background model with respect to the cluster model , as well as the hard and soft x - ray background ( xrb ) components ,",
    "is then set as a variable parameter also with a flat prior from 0 to 1 .",
    "we model the soft galactic x - ray background using a uniform emission component consisting of a mekal spectral model with wabs absorption .",
    "the plasma temperature is fixed at 0.16 kev , with a metal abundance of @xmath71 at @xmath72 , and the absorption is fixed at @xmath73@xmath3 .",
    "similarly , the hard xrb , presumably due to superposition of unresolved agns , is modeled using a power law with @xmath74 and with absorption fixed at @xmath75@xmath3 . in general , it is customary to use zero absorption for the soft xrb and galactic absorption for the hard component in xrb analysis ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "we choose here to use the above values simply due to the fact that they give a better fit to the data in our analysis of the blank fields mentioned above , as well as source - free regions outside the clusters analyzed here .",
    "an example of the background model spectrum for two observations with the filter wheel in the closed position is shown in figure [ epicback ] .",
    "all parameters of the background models are global .    [",

    "this paper describes an application of the markov chain monte carlo technique developed by us for the analysis of observations with the _ xmm - newton _ imaging instruments .",
    "we demonstrate the flexibility and power of this technique  employing smoothed particle inference  via studies of three very different clusters , abell 1689 , rx j0658 - 55 and centaurus , especially regarding the ability to determine the spatial distribution of temperature of the radiating plasma , which is difficult via more traditional techniques .",
    "we found evidence for cluster merger activity in all these systems , but in each case , the signature was quite distinct .",
    "the bullet of rx j0658 - 55 , the remnant of a merger in centaurus and the asymmetry of temperature in a1689 may roughly correspond to the early , middle , and late stages of cluster merging . in all cases",
    "the core of the cluster seemed relatively unaffected .",
    "further systematic studies in temperature structure may add to our understanding of the effect of mergers on cluster properties .",
    "the most important difference of our technique compared to conventional modeling is that we use overlapping emission components .",
    "this facilitates the use of a large number of phases describing the x - ray emission at each spatial coordinate .",
    "this scenario is much more physical than when one adapts the assumption that any given point in the projected cluster image can be described by a single - temperature phase .",
    "however , it also poses the challenge of constraining a distribution of phases when the spectra of high - temperature plasmas in particular are very similar .",
    "comparison with other analyses requires the projection of a distribution into a single value .",
    "we have chosen in this paper to show the mode and the median of that distribution in our temperature maps along with the associated 1 @xmath56 variations ( see figures [ a1689terr ] , [ bulletterr ] , and [ centerr ] ) .",
    "the difference in the assumptions in modeling precludes any direct comparison with other measurements , and it is more than likely that the results will be different . the median of our distributions in particular will depend on the choice of the allowed range of temperatures in the model .",
    "this is especially true for the choice of the upper boundary in high - temperature sources .",
    "the selection of the boundaries must be based on prior knowledge of the source , such as measurements in the hard x - ray band .",
    "this introduces a systematic uncertainty that has to be taken into account .",
    "another advantage of this technique is the way we treat the background .",
    "since the background is modelled instead of subtracted , difficult aspects of background subtraction , such as weighing the different vignetting of different components , are avoided .",
    "the background model has been calibrated against a number of observations in which the filter wheel was closed , as well as against numerous `` blank sky '' observations ( see section [ backsec ] ) .",
    "even though we allow the normalizations of different background components to be optimized by the mcmc , there is still a small systematic uncertainty associated with residual calibration uncertainties .    in this work",
    "we have opted to simultaneously fit the spatial distributions of the temperature , metallicity , and redshift of the x - ray - emitting , plasma illustrating the broad power of the method .",
    "this is not necessarily the optimal approach to answer a specific question about the cluster , such as resolving a redshift difference across a1689 .",
    "this may explain the larger statistical uncertainty obtained in this work compared to our conventional analysis @xcite .",
    "for such a problem the method could be designed specifically for this purpose .",
    "since temperature and metallicity variations are small across this cluster these could be global parameters in the modeling significantly simplifying the overall problem .",
    "for such tasks that are highly dependent on detailed spectral features , the number of cluster particles should also be kept to a minimum to avoid the risk of smearing the spectral feature in question .",
    "this is , however , a compromise , since a lower number of particles would limit the spatial resolution of the spectral feature that one wants to resolve .    in summary ,",
    "the statistical uncertainties in this work , which are inherent in problems with large numbers of degrees of freedom , may seem larger than those that are achieved in traditional analyses , but the uncertainties can always be reduced by simplifying the problem .",
    "this work attempts to constrain all cluster characteristics into a single model .",
    "there will be other applications in which a specific model can be tested to answer a specific problem .",
    "we expect that this method will prove to be powerful in the determination of cluster gas density and entropy .",
    "since the model is multi parametric and analytical , based on the markov chain posterior , the smoothed particles can be manipulated in order to construct a three - dimensional cluster model . in principle , the @xmath53-coordinate can be chosen for each particle on the basis of some assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "this can be done separately in ranges of particle plasma temperature , assuming that particles of similar temperatures exhibit the same structure as in the two - dimensional case .",
    "this will accurately produce the temperature gradient in the three - dimensional case while preserving the two - dimensional observed structure .",
    "this is likely the most accurate method to determine the three - dimensional spectrally resolved structure of galaxy clusters in the x - ray band .    since the likelihood calculation does not have to be limited to a single instrument , but",
    "can potentially include multiple x - ray instruments or even data from other kinds of measurements ( such as gravitational lensing , sunyaev - zeldovich data , or optical velocity dispersions ) , the method is quite general .",
    "this method is also well suited to analyze other complex , spatially resolved objects where the observed x - ray emission might consist of superposed separable components with varying spectral parameters , such as in supernova remnants .",
    "we acknowledge many helpful discussions on the suitability of smooth particles for modeling cluster data with phil marshall . financial support for ka",
