    "physical phenomena that impose patterns with characteristic length scales can be utilized for the self - assembly of spatially ordered metal nanoparticles which have various applications , including in magnetics , catalysis , nanophotonics and plasmonics @xcite .",
    "nonlinear dynamical instabilities which evolve into a robust stable state characterized by a narrow range of length scales are especially well - suited for this purpose .",
    "typically such self - assembly of ordered patterns on surfaces and thin films arises from the competition between various physico - chemical effects .",
    "for example , surface rippling under ion irradiation can be attributed to an instability resulting from the competition between irradiation induced ion erosion and smoothing due to surface diffusion .",
    "the length and time scales of the ensuing patterns are determined by ion flux , surface temperature and surface diffusion parameters @xcite**. * * alternately , nanopatterns could result from instabilities of a thin fluid layer leading to spatio - temporal re - organization of the fluid with well defined length and time scales that depend on the thermophysical material properties such as interfacial tension , fluid / substrate contact angle , fluid viscosity and , for ultrathin films , long range dispersion forces such as van der waal s interactions .",
    "an example of pattern formation by such instabilities is dewetting of thin films caused by a hydrodynamic instability which occurs when attractive intermolecular forces overcome the stabilizing effect of interfacial tension @xcite . under such conditions , film thickness fluctuations",
    "are spontaneously amplified eventually leading to film rupture and the formation of drops / particles with well defined spatial order @xcite .",
    "dewetting dynamics leading to particle formation have been studied in detail in polymer films that are in the liquid state close to room temperature @xcite . in comparison , studying dewetting in metals is challenging due to the high melting point of most metals .",
    "metal dewetting under conventional long - time annealing is complicated because various surface processes including metal - substrate chemical interactions and metal diffusion into the substrate can influence dewetting @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "rapid melting techniques such as ion irradiation @xcite or _",
    "pulse laser heating could minimize such undesirable effects and permit experiments over practical time scales @xcite .",
    "approximately 10 years ago it was shown that _",
    "ns _ laser pulse melting of various metals ( au , cu , ni ) on a _ cr metal layer _ resulted in dewetting patterns with spatial order @xcite .",
    "however , pattern formation and self - assembly of spatially ordered patterns under pulsed laser dewetting of metal films deposited directly on sio@xmath0 ( a substrate of choice for many opto - electronic applications ) have not been pursued in great detail , especially in nanoscopic metal films with thickness @xmath7 @xmath19 the laser absorption depth @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , pattern evolution under the application of thermally - independent multiple pulses ( i.e. the film undergoes melting during the pulse and resolidification between pulses ) with varying laser parameters to understand the dynamics of metal dewetting as well as the length scales of the variety of different patterns have not been investigated .",
    "this is of fundamental importance since the _ unique _ thermophysical properties of metallic liquids , including their high surface tension @xmath21 of @xmath22 and large thermal conductivities , distinguish them from the typical liquid polymers ( @xmath23 ) investigated in the past .",
    "therefore , liquid metals could present novel patterning mechanisms and/or characteristics .",
    "another important question of broader fundamental interest is related to the applicability of _ continuum - level _ conservation equations ( for heat , mass and momentum ) at the nanoscopic length scales ( _ h _",
    "< @xmath24 nm ) used in the present experiments . note that the application of atomistic or mesoscopic techniques to problems which involve phase change and surface deformation under fast thermal cycles is not entirely straightforward and first principles - based atomistic / mesoscopic simulations of such phenomena are beyond present capabilities .",
    "hence , the importance of developing experimentally validated continuum - level models for such processes can not be over - emphasized .",
    "recently we showed that multiple _ @xmath25 _ pulsed laser melting of nanoscopic co films leads to short- and/or long - range spatial order @xcite .",
    "we provided preliminary evidence that dewetting by multiple _",
    "pulse laser melting shows characteristics of a thin film hydrodynamic ( tfh ) instability , such as the spinodal process @xcite .",
    "this was based on the observation that the final nanoparticle morphology , quantitatively described by the nearest - neighbour ( nn ) particle spacing ( @xmath26 ) and diameter ( @xmath27 ) , is consistent with the prediction of the linear tfh theory which was modified to incorporate long range inter - molecular attractive forces of van der waal s type .",
    "however , the quantitative role of various laser parameters including the energy density @xmath3 and time ( as measured implicitly by the number of pulses @xmath4 ) on pattern evolution was not investigated in detail . in this work we present a detailed account of pattern formation and dewetting under _ multiple ns _ pulsed laser irradiation of co nanofilms ( @xmath1 < @xmath28 ) on sio@xmath0 in the light of first - principles thermal modeling and tfh theory ( sec .",

    "[ sec : laser - energy - threshold ] we show that by accounting appropriately for the changes in the reflectivity of the substrate - metal bilayer with respect to _ h _ , quantitative agreement can be obtained between experimental observations and the predictions of continuum - level theory for the _ h_-dependence of the melting energy threshold , pattern length scale and particle size .",
    "this observation corroborates atomistic simulations of heat transport for simpler fluids under shear flow which , for liquid layers with several ( 6 - 7 ) atomic layers @xcite , yielded thermal profiles consistent with predictions of continuum - level analysis . for the metal films used in this work ,",
    "this translates to _ h _ < 1 nm . the thermal model also predicted the development of intrinsic thermal gradients @xmath8 whose sign is positive for @xmath29 a critical value @xmath30 and negative for @xmath31 .",
    "this would imply that thermocapillary effects ( i.e. flow induced by surface tension gradient along the perturbed interface which samples an _ h_-dependent temperature field ) could also be an important mechanism of pattern formation .",
    "for the experimental thickness regime investigated , the thermal diffusion time scales @xmath32 @xmath33 pulse time @xmath34 and therefore the influence of @xmath8 was observed to be minimal .",
    "however , since @xmath35 , thermocapillary mechanisms could be important for thicker films , a hypothesis that needs to be verified by future experimental studies . in sec .",
    "[ sub : dewetting - pattern - evolution ] , we discuss the quantitative behavior of pattern evolution as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . extremely fast thermal cycles ( heating / cooling rates of o(@xmath36k / s ) ) were predicted by the thermal modeling , implying that each laser pulse was thermally independent of one another ( repetition rate : 50 hz ) .",
    "furthermore , the model predicted liquid lifetimes @xmath16 of @xmath17 , while the linear tfh theory @xcite predicted a dewetting time scale @xmath18 implying that multiple pulses would be required to observe the instability , as confirmed by experiments .",
    "we suggest that once dewetting was initiated by melting of the thin film , subsequent pulses continued to foster the instability and each laser pulse captured snapshots of its progression . experimentally , the dewetting patterns were characterized by short range order ( sro ) at all observed stages of dewetting with the patterns typically evolving with increasing number of laser pulses @xmath4 from discrete holes to bicontinuous or cellular structures and eventually into nanoparticles .",
    "these nanoparticles form by capillary flow rather than a rayleigh - like breakup typically observed in polymer liquids .",
    "this behavior can be attributed to the large capillary velocity ( ratio of interfacial tension @xmath21 to fluid viscosity @xmath37 ) for the metal nanolayers resulting from its unique thermophysical parameters , including a large @xmath38 , small @xmath39 and small pattern length scales due to its large hamaker constant @xmath40 .",
    "this final nanoparticle state was robust , characterized by sro in nn spacing @xmath26 and a monomodal size distribution with diameter @xmath27 with the observed trends of @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "this robustness could be explained by two effects : ( i ) the relatively weak temperature dependence of the thermophysical parameters of co ; and ( ii ) the minimal particle coarsening due to surface diffusion since the diffusion time scale is much greater than that of the thermal processing time @xmath43 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : role - of - co ] we show that the pattern ripening rate @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the characteristic pattern length , increased linearly with @xmath3 at the early stages of patterning which could be explained by the predicted linear increase in @xmath16 with @xmath3 . _ overall , these results show that pattern formation and dewetting in liquid metal nanolayers under fast thermal cycles can result in novel mechanisms and , experimental observations in conjunction with theoretical analyses of thermal cycles and tfh instabilities offer quantitative guidelines for achieving desired quenched - in morphologies with predictable length scales . _",

    "<S> hydrodynamic pattern formation ( pf ) and dewetting resulting from pulsed laser induced melting of nanoscopic metal films have been used to create spatially ordered metal nanoparticle arrays with monomodal size distribution on sio@xmath0/si substrates . </S>",
    "<S> pf was investigated for film thickness @xmath1 < laser absorption depth @xmath2 and different sets of laser parameters , including energy density @xmath3 and the irradiation time , as measured by the number of pulses @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> pf was only observed to occur for @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the @xmath7-dependent threshold energy required to melt the film . </S>",
    "<S> _ even at such small length scales _ , theoretical predictions for @xmath6 obtained from a continuum - level lumped parameter heat transfer model for the film temperature , coupled with the 1-d transient heat equation for the substrate phase , were consistent with experimental observations provided that the thickness dependence of the reflectivity of the metal - substrate bilayer was incorporated into the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the model also predicted that perturbations in _ </S>",
    "<S> h _ would result in intrinsic thermal gradients @xmath8 whose magnitude and sign depend on @xmath7 , with @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 . for the thickness range investigated here , </S>",
    "<S> the resulting thermocapillary effect was minimal since the thermal diffusion time @xmath13 the pulse time . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the spacing between the nanoparticles and the particle diameter were found to increase as @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , which is consistent with the predictions of the thin film hydrodynamic ( tfh ) dewetting theory . </S>",
    "<S> pf was characterized by the appearance of discrete holes followed by bicontinuous or cellular patterns which finally consolidated into nanoparticles via capillary flow rather than via rayleigh - like instabilities reported for low temperature dewetting of viscous liquids . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is attributed to the high capillary velocities of the liquid metal arising from its relatively large interfacial tension and low viscosity as well as the smaller length scales of the liquid bridges in the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted liquid phase lifetime @xmath16 was between @xmath17 , which is much smaller than the dewetting time @xmath18 as predicted by the linear tfh theory . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , dewetting required the application of multiple pulses . during the early stages of dewetting , </S>",
    "<S> the ripening rate , as measured by the rate of change of characteristic ordering length with respect to @xmath4 , increased linearly with @xmath3 due to the linear increase in @xmath16 with increasing @xmath3 as predicted by the thermal model . </S>",
    "<S> the final nanoparticle spacing was robust , independent of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and only dependent on @xmath7 due to the relatively weak temperature dependence of the thermophysical properties of the metal ( co ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that fast thermal processing combined with the unique thermophysical parameters of metals can lead to novel pattern formation , including quenching of a wide range of length scales and morphologies . </S>"
