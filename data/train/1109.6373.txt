    "softly broken supersymmetry ( susy ) provides a very attractive framework for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) , in which the hierarchy problem is solved and the unification of gauge couplings can be realised @xcite .",
    "despite these attractive features , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) suffers from the @xmath3 problem .",
    "the superpotential of the mssm contains the bilinear term @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the higgs doublet superfields . in order to get the correct pattern of electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking the parameter @xmath3 is required to be in the tev region . at the same time",
    "the incorporation of the mssm into supergravity ( sugra ) or grand unified theories ( gut ) implies that @xmath3 should be of the order of gut or planck scales .",
    "an elegant solution to this problem arises within @xmath1 inspired susy models . at high energies",
    "@xmath1 gut symmetry can be broken to the rank5 subgroup @xmath7 where in general @xmath8 and the two anomaly - free @xmath9 and @xmath10 symmetries originate from the breakings @xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath10 . if @xmath15 or @xmath16 the extra @xmath17 gauge symmetry forbids the bilinear @xmath3 term but allows interaction @xmath18 in the superpotential . at low energies ( @xmath19 ) the scalar component of the sm singlet superfield @xmath20 acquires a non  zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) breaking @xmath17 and giving rise to an effective @xmath3 term .",
    "within the class of rank5 @xmath1 inspired susy models with extra @xmath17 gauge symmetry , there is a unique choice of abelian gauge group that allows zero charges for right - handed neutrinos .",
    "this is the @xmath21 gauge symmetry given by @xmath22 . only in this exceptional supersymmetric standard model ( e@xmath0ssm ) , which is based on the @xmath23 gauge group , right - handed neutrinos may be superheavy , shedding light on the origin of the mass hierarchy in the lepton sector @xcite-@xcite .    to ensure anomaly cancellation the particle content of the e@xmath0ssm is extended to include three complete fundamental @xmath24 representations of @xmath1 .",
    "these multiplets decompose under the @xmath25 subgroup of @xmath1 as follows : @xmath26 the first and second quantities in brackets are the @xmath27 representation and extra @xmath21 charge respectively , while @xmath28 is a family index that runs from 1 to 3 .",
    "an ordinary sm family , which contains the doublets of left  handed quarks @xmath29 and leptons @xmath30 , right - handed up and down  quarks ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) as well as right  handed charged leptons , is assigned to @xmath33 + @xmath34 .",

    "the next - to - last term , @xmath37 , represents sm - singlet fields @xmath38 , which carry non - zero @xmath21 charges and therefore survive down to the ew scale .",
    "the pair of @xmath39doublets ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) that are contained in @xmath42 and @xmath43 have the quantum numbers of higgs doublets .",
    "they form either higgs or inert higgs @xmath39 multiplets .",
    "other components of these @xmath27 multiplets form colour triplets of exotic quarks @xmath44 and @xmath45 with electric charges @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",

    "in addition to the complete @xmath50 multiplets the low energy matter content of the e@xmath0ssm can be supplemented by an @xmath39 doublet @xmath51 and anti - doublet @xmath52 from the extra @xmath53 and @xmath54 to preserve gauge coupling unification .",
    "these components of the @xmath1 fundamental representation originate from @xmath55 of @xmath53 and @xmath56 of @xmath54 by construction .",
    "anomaly cancellation is still guaranteed since @xmath51 and @xmath52 originate from the @xmath53 and @xmath54 supermultiplets .",
    "the analysis performed in @xcite shows that the unification of gauge couplings in the e@xmath0ssm can be achieved for any phenomenologically acceptable value of @xmath57 consistent with the measured low energy central value .",
    "the successful leptogenesis in the early epoch of the universe is the distinctive feature of the e@xmath0ssm .",
    "indeed , the heavy majorana right - handed neutrinos may decay unequally into final states with lepton number @xmath58 , thereby creating a lepton asymmetry in the early universe . because in the e@xmath0ssm the yukawa couplings of the new exotic particles are not constrained by the neutrino oscillation data , substantial values of cp  violating lepton asymmetries can be induced even for a relatively small mass of the lightest right  handed neutrino ( @xmath59 ) so that successful thermal leptogenesis may be achieved without encountering gravitino problem @xcite . since sphalerons violate @xmath60 but conserve @xmath48 , this lepton asymmetry subsequently gets converted into the present observed baryon asymmetry of the universe through the ew phase transition @xcite .",
    "as in the mssm the gauge symmetry in the e@xmath0ssm does not forbid lepton and baryon number violating operators that result in rapid proton decay .",
    "moreover , exotic particles in @xmath1 inspired susy models give rise to new yukawa interactions that in general induce unacceptably large non  diagonal flavour transitions .",
    "to suppress these effects in the e@xmath0ssm an approximate @xmath61 symmetry is imposed . under this symmetry all superfields except one pair of @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( say @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) and one sm - type singlet field ( @xmath64 ) are odd .",

    "the vev of the sm - type singlet field , @xmath76 , breaks the extra @xmath77 symmetry generating exotic fermion masses and also inducing that of the @xmath78 boson .",
    "therefore the singlet field @xmath20 must acquire a large vev in order to avoid conflict with direct particle searches at present and past accelerators .",
    "this also requires the yukawa couplings @xmath79 and @xmath80 to be reasonably large .",
    "if @xmath79 or @xmath80 are large enough at the gut scale they affect the evolution of the soft scalar mass @xmath81 of the singlet field @xmath20 rather strongly resulting in a negative value of @xmath81 at low energies which triggers the breakdown of the @xmath21 symmetry .",
    "although @xmath61 eliminates any problems related with baryon number violation and non - diagonal flavour transitions it also forbids all yukawa interactions that would allow the exotic quarks to decay . since models with stable charged exotic particles are ruled out by various experiments the @xmath61 symmetry must be broken . at the same time",
    ", the breakdown of @xmath61 should not give rise to operators that would lead to rapid proton decay .",
    "there are two ways to overcome this problem : the lagrangian must be invariant with respect to either a @xmath82 symmetry , under which all superfields except leptons are even ( model i ) , or a @xmath83 discrete symmetry , which implies that exotic quark and lepton superfields are odd whereas the others remain even ( model ii ) . if the lagrangian is invariant under the @xmath82 symmetry , then the terms in the superpotential which permit exotic quarks to decay and are allowed by the @xmath1 symmetry can be written in the form @xmath84 that implies that exotic quarks are diquarks .",

    "( [ icn12 ] ) @xmath206 is the set of inert neutralino eigenstates with positive eigenvalues , while @xmath207 equals 0 ( 1 ) if the eigenvalue corresponding to @xmath208 is positive ( negative ) .    in our analysis",
    "we require that the lightest inert neutralino account for all or some of the observed dark matter relic density .",
    "this sets another stringent constraint on the masses and couplings of @xmath209 . indeed , because the lightest inert neutralino states are almost inert singlinos , their couplings to the gauge bosons , higgs states , quarks ( squarks ) and leptons ( sleptons ) are rather small resulting in a relatively small annihilation cross section of @xmath210 and the possibility of an unacceptably large dark matter density .",
    "thus the bulk of the e@xmath0ssm parameter space , that leads to small masses of @xmath211 , is almost ruled out the masses of @xmath211 and @xmath212 tend to zero and inert singlino states essentially decouple from the rest of the spectrum . in this limit",
    "the lightest non - decoupled neutralino may be rather stable and can play the role of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the presence of very light neutral fermions in the particle spectrum might have interesting implications for the neutrino physics ( see , for example @xcite ) . ] .",
    "a reasonable density of dark matter can be obtained for @xmath213 when the lightest inert neutralino states annihilate mainly through an @xmath76channel @xmath134-boson , via its inert higgsino doublet components which couple to the @xmath134boson .",
    "if @xmath211 annihilation proceeds through the @xmath134boson resonance , i.e. @xmath214 , then an appropriate value of dark matter density can be achieved even for a relatively small coupling of @xmath211 to @xmath134 .",
    "since the masses of @xmath199 and @xmath200 are much larger than the @xmath215quark mass and the decays of @xmath203 into these neutralinos are kinematically allowed , the sm  like higgs boson decays predominantly into the lightest inert neutralino states and has very small branching ratios ( @xmath216 ) for decays into sm particles @xcite@xcite .",
    "the lightest inert neutralino states can get appreciable masses @xmath217 only if at least one light inert chargino state and two inert neutralinos states , which are predominantly components of the @xmath39 doublet , have masses below @xmath218 .",
    "the inert chargino and neutralinos states that are mainly inert higgsinos couple rather strongly to @xmath219 and @xmath134bosons and therefore can be efficiently produced at the lhc and then decay into the lsp and pairs of leptons and quarks giving rise to remarkable signatures which can be observed in the near future .",
    "if the masses of @xmath199 and @xmath200 are very close then the decays of @xmath203 into @xmath220 will give rise to a large invisible branching ratio of the sm  like higgs boson .",
    "when the mass difference between the second lightest and the lightest inert neutralinos is larger than @xmath221 the invisible branching ratio remains dominant but some of the decay products of @xmath222 might be observed at the lhc . in particular , there is a chance that soft @xmath223 pairs may be detected .",
    "since the branching ratios of @xmath203 into sm particles are extremely suppressed , the decays of the sm  like higgs boson into @xmath224 could be important for higgs searches @xcite .",
