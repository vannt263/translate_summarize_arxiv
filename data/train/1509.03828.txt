    "nonlinear evolution equations are often associated with the theory of solitons and integrable systems @xcite .",
    "a prime example is the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation which constitutes one of the universal nonlinear evolution equations , with applications ranging from deep water waves to optics @xcite .",
    "remarkable phenomena are also exhibited by its higher - order variants , emerging in a diverse spectrum of applications , such as nonlinear optics @xcite , nonlinear metamaterials @xcite , and water waves in finite depth @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , dissipative variants of nls models incorporating gain and loss have also been used in optics @xcite , e.g. , in the physics of mode - locked lasers @xcite ( see also the relevant works @xcite ) and polariton superfluids @xcite  see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for various applications .",
    "note that such dissipative nls models can be viewed as variants of the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation , which has been extensively studied , especially in the context of pattern formation in far - from - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "dissipative nonlinear evolution equations ( incorporating gain , loss , external driving , or combinations thereof ) may exhibit ( and potentially be attracted to ) low - dimensional dynamical features , such as : ( a ) one or more equilibria ( and orbits connecting them ) , ( b ) periodic orbits , ( c ) quasi - periodic orbits or ( d ) low - dimensional chaotic dynamics  @xcite . the availability of the dynamical scenarios ( a)-(d ) depends on the effective dimensionality of the low dimensional behavior ; one - dimensionality only allows fixed points , planar systems governed by the poincar - bendixson ( pb ) theorem  @xcite can also feature periodic orbits , while higher dimensions allow for quasi - periodic or chaotic dynamics .",
    "various prototypical partial differential equation models have demonstrated a pb - type behavior as an intermediate bifurcation stage in the route to spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "examples include the kuramoto - sivashinsky @xcite and complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equations ; regarding the cgl model , which is of primary interest in this work , we refer to the seminal works @xcite for the spatiotemporal transition to chaos .",
    "in addition to the above autonomous systems , spatiotemporal chaos was also found in non - autonomous ones , due to the interplay between loss and external forces , such as the damped - driven nls @xcite ( where the hyperbolic structure of the underlying integrable nls is a prerequisite @xcite ) and the sine - gordon @xcite system . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the role of higher order effects , and investigate the possibility of bifurcation phenomena leading to the existence of the above prototypical examples of low - dimensional dynamics in an autonomous , physically important higher - order cgl - type model .",
    "this model , is motivated by the higher - order nls equation that is commonly used , e.g. , in studies of ultrashort pulses in optical fibers @xcite , but also incorporates ( linear or nonlinear ) gain and loss ; it is , thus , a physically relevant variant of a higher - order cubic cgl equation  without the diffusion term .",
    "note that higher - order versions of the cgl equation , have only recently started attracting attention @xcite , while extended second - order cgl models have been extensively studied in various contexts previously  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we refer to the pioneering work @xcite , followed by the important contributions @xcite , which revealed the existence of the aforementioned low - dimensional dynamical scenarios for second - order quintic cgl models .",
    "the results of @xcite were established by numerical and even analytical reductions to suitable finite dimensional dynamical systems , capturing the long - time dynamics of the original infinite dimensional one .",
    "notably , the revealed dynamical scenarios were associated with a variety of novel localized structures ( known as pulsating solitons ) .",
    "however , a crucial feature of these models as acknowledged , e.g. , by the authors of  @xcite was the presence of a higher order ( quintic ) nonlinearity .",
    "this is a key trait distinguishing that set of works from the present one where only cubic nonlinearity is employed , yet the presence of higher order effects , most notably third order dispersion as we will see below , plays a catalytic role in the emergence of the relevant phenomenology .",
    "more specifically , we should point out that the _ third - order cubic _ cgl model that we consider herein is essentially different from the _ second - order cubic - quintic _ model discussed in @xcite , not only from a mathematical but also from a physical point of view : indeed , in the context of optics , the model considered in the latter works refers to propagation of short pulses , in the picosecond regime , in media featuring saturation of the nonlinear refractive index , while the model we consider here is relevant to propagation of _ ultrashort _ pulses in the sub - picosecond or femtosecond regimes @xcite .",
    "for this reason , our model includes third - order dispersion and higher - order nonlinear effects , that appear naturally as higher - order corrections of the usual nls model in the framework of the reductive perturbation method . in that regard , and if gain and loss are also incorporated , it is important to ask if , and how , the physically important ( in the femtosecond time - scale ) higher - order effects may be responsible for tracing a path to complex dynamics , as a result of the potential breaking of the homoclinic structure of the unperturbed nls counterpart .",
    "the main findings of our investigations are the following .",
    "first , we show that the incorporation of the gain and loss terms gives rise to the existence of an attractor ; a rigorous proof is provided , based on the interpretation of the energy balance equation and properties of the functional ( phase ) space on which the problem defines an infinite - dimensional flow .",
    "the structure of the attractor is then investigated numerically . given that our model is characterized by six free parameters ( which renders a systematic investigation of their role a nontrivial task )",
    ", we opt to keep four parameters fixed , with values suggested by the physics of ultrashort optical pulses @xcite , and vary the remaining two .",
    "in particular , we vary the coefficients of the third - order dispersion and the higher - order nonlinear dissipation , accounting for the stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) effect ( more important reasons for this choice will become apparent below ) .",
    "we find that , for sufficiently small srs coefficient , variations of the third - order dispersion strength give rise to a transition path from dynamics reminiscent of pb , including orbital connections between steady states of high multiplicity and convergence to limit cycles , to invariant tori or even chaotic attractors .",
    "however , when the srs effect becomes stronger , the above scenarios are screened by convergence to steady - states .",
    "it is highlighted that the third - order dispersion is found to be chiefly responsible for a dynamical transition from periodic , to quasi - periodic and eventually to chaotic structures .",
    "therefore , our results show that higher ( third)-order dispersion and dissipative ( srs ) effects are important mechanisms for the emergence of complex spatiotemporal transitions in cgl models . our presentation is organized as follows . in section  ii ,",
    "we present the model , and discuss the existence of a limit set ( attractor ) .",
    "details on the proof of such a limit set are given in the appendix [ apls ] .",
    "the structure of the attractor is then investigated numerically in section  iii .",
    "we thus reveal the emergence of all dynamical scenarios and corresponding regimes of complex asymptotic behavior .",
    "finally , section  iv summarizes our findings .",
    "our model is motivated by the following higher - order nls equation : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex field , subscripts denote partial differentiation , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are positive constants , while @xmath6 denotes normal ( anomalous ) group velocity dispersion .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) can be viewed as a perturbed nls equation , with the perturbation ( in case of small values of relevant coefficients ) appearing in the right - hand side ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and discussion below ) .",
    "variants of eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) appear in a variety of physical contexts , where they are derived at higher - order approximations of perturbation theory [ the lowest - order nonlinear model is simply the nls equation in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) ] .",
    "the most prominent example is probably that of nonlinear optics @xcite . in this case ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 denote propagation distance and retarded time , respectively , while @xmath1 is the electric field envelope . while the unperturbed nls equation is sufficient to describe optical pulse propagation , for ultra - short pulses third - order dispersion and self - steepening ( characterized by coefficients @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ) become important and have to be incorporated in the model .",
    "similar situations also occur in other contexts and , thus , corresponding versions of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) have been derived and used , e.g. , in nonlinear metamaterials @xcite , but also in water waves in finite depth @xcite . moreover , in the context of optics , and for relatively long propagation distances , higher - order nonlinear dissipative effects , such as the srs effect , of strength @xmath9 , are also important @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned effects , our aim is to investigate the dynamics in the framework of eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) , but also incorporating linear or nonlinear gain and loss . this way , in what follows , we are going to analyze the following model : @xmath10 which includes linear loss ( @xmath11 ) [ or gain ( @xmath12 ) ] .",
    "these effects are physically relevant in nonlinear optics @xcite : indeed , nonlinear gain ( @xmath13 ) [ or loss ( @xmath14 ) ] may be used to counterbalance the effects from the linear loss / gain mechanisms and can potentially stabilize optical solitons ",
    "see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . as is also explained below , here we focus on the case of linear gain , @xmath12 , and nonlinear loss , @xmath14 , corresponding to a constant gain distribution , and the intensity - dependent two - photon absorption , respectively ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . obviously , the presence of gain / loss renders eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) a higher - order cubic cgl equation ( cf .",
    "recent studies @xcite on such models ) .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , diffusion is absent : such a linear term would be of the form @xmath15 ( @xmath16const . ) , and would appear in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to account for the presence of spectral filtering or linear parabolic gain ( @xmath17 ) or loss ( @xmath18 ) @xcite",
    ". instead , the equation only features linear dispersion through the term proportional to @xmath19 in the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the gain / loss effects are pivotal for the dissipative nature of the infinite - dimensional flow that will be defined below .",
    "this dissipative nature is reflected in the existence of an attractor , capturing its long - time dynamics ; nevertheless , as we will show below , the structure of the attractor is determined by the remaining higher - order effects .    here , we focus on the case @xmath20 , and supplement eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with periodic boundary conditions for @xmath21 and its spatial derivatives up to the - second order , namely : @xmath22 @xmath23 $ ] , for some @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is given .",
    "the initial condition @xmath26 also satisfies the periodicity conditions  ( [ eq2 ] ) . here , we should mention that the periodic boundary conditions that we consider here are also motivated by the context of optics . recalling that the roles of space and time are interchanged in the latter context",
    ", we note that , indeed , in optical cavities ( e.g. , ones for lasers ) , the period @xmath27 would account for the ( retarded ) time it takes light to traverse to the laser cavity once and , thus , the boundaries represent the same point in the real space - time ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this context , the dynamics that will be analyzed below are relevant to the dynamical transitions and the observation of chaotic optical waveforms in fiber ring lasers @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , all possible regimes except @xmath12 , @xmath14 , are associated with finite - time collapse or decay .",
    "furthermore , a critical value @xmath28 can be identified in the regime @xmath11 , @xmath13 , which separates finite - time collapse from the decay of solutions . on the other hand , for @xmath12 , @xmath14 ,",
    "we prove in appendix [ apls ] the existence of a limit set ( attractor ) @xmath29 , attracting all bounded orbits initiating from arbitrary , appropriately smooth initial data @xmath30 ( considered as elements of a suitable sobolev space ) . in the next section",
    ", we will show numerically that the attractor @xmath29 captures the full route from pb - type dynamics to quasi - periodic or chaotic dynamics .",
    "the structure of the limit set @xmath29 , is investigated by numerical integration via a high - accuracy pseudo - spectral method . in our simulations",
    ", we fix the half length of @xmath31 to @xmath32 , and the ratio @xmath33 to be of the order of unity , and thus fix @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this choice , which stems from the fact that this ratio determines the constant density steady - state ( see below ) , will be particularly convenient for illustration purposes .",
    "furthermore , motivated by the fact that , in the context of optics , parameters describing the higher - order effects take , typically , small values @xcite , we fix @xmath36 , while third - order dispersion and srs strengths , @xmath37 , @xmath9 , are varied in the intervals @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] , respectively .    obviously , the above choice is merely a low - dimensional projection of the full 6-dimensional parameter space . nevertheless , since our scope here is to illustrate the role of higher - order effects on the emergence of complex dynamics in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we will show below that the variations of @xmath2 and @xmath5 alone do offer a clear physical picture in that regard . to be more specific",
    ", the choice of those particular parameters stems from the following facts .",
    "first , third - order dispersion is the sole linear higher - order effect , which is important also in the linear regime ( as it modifies the linear dispersion relation ) .",
    "second , the stimulated raman scattering effect is the first higher - order dissipative effect and , as such , is expected to play dominant role in the long - time nonlinear dynamics of the system .",
    "naturally , the nontrivial task ( as also highlighted above ) of investigating the full parameter space is interesting and relevant in its own right , yet it is beyond the scope of this work .    in our simulations , the limit set @xmath29 will be visualized by projections of the flow to suitable 2d or 3d spaces , defined by @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . here , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , for arbitrary spatial coordinates @xmath45 .",

    "it is observed that for relatively small values of the srs coefficient , namely for @xmath211 ( cf .",
    "grey - shaded area , labeled by sr ) , chaotic behavior persists . on the other hand , above this threshold ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath212 , chaotic structures are destroyed , and the system enters into the metastability regime ( labeled by rw in the diagram ) .",
    "the ultimate steady - state is @xmath181 for these parameters .",
    "note that the instability of quasi - periodic and space - time periodic regimes under the influence of small increments of @xmath5 , occurs in a very similar manner , and can be plotted in similar bifurcation diagrams ( results not shown here ) .",
    "second , the interval @xmath130 persists even in the absence of the rest of the higher - order effects , i.e. , for @xmath128 .",
    "this highlights the fact that the third - order dispersion plays a dominant role in the emergence of complex dynamics .",
    "an example of the chaotic behavior , for @xmath204 and @xmath213 , is shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . in particular",

    "in conclusion , we have studied a physically important and broadly relevant higher - order ginzburg - landau equation , with zero diffusion .",
    "the considered model , is motivated by a higher - order nonlinear schrdinger equation , which finds applications in a variety of contexts , ranging from nonlinear fiber optics and deep water waves ; the model also incorporates linear loss and nonlinear gain , while it is supplemented with periodic boundary conditions , which are relevant to optical cavities settings , such as ones employed , e.g. , in ring lasers .",
    "our analysis revealed that the infinite - dimensional dynamics of this model can be reduced to a sequence of low - dimensional dynamical scenarios ( fixed points , periodic and quasi - periodic , as well as chaotic orbits ) that can be suitably revealed in reduced ( two- and three - dimensional ) phase space representations .",
    "such a dynamical picture is shared by various non - integrable perturbations of hamiltonian partial differential equations ( such as the nls , sine - gordon , and others ) , as these perturbations may break the homoclinic structure of their integrable counterparts .",
    "however , the path to all the above dynamical scenarios can be traced in drastically different ways and to essentially distinct roots , even if the systems have similar origins for their dissipative nature manifested by the existence of an attractor , e.g. , due to the presence of gain / loss , as in the case of cgl models .",
    "in particular , in our higher - order cgl model , keeping gain / loss  as well as other coefficients of the higher - order effects  fixed , we have shown that the competition between third - order dispersion and the srs effect ( in the presence of nonlinearity , dispersion , and gain / loss ) can trace a path from poincar - bendixson  type behavior to quasi - periodic or chaotic dynamics .",
    "these dynamical transitions are also reminiscent of ones observed in fiber ring lasers , or in the path towards optical turbulence phenomena @xcite .",
    "a conspicuous finding was that third - order dispersion chiefly appears to be playing a critical role in controlling the transition from periodic to quasi - periodic , and eventually to chaotic behavior , even in the absence of the rest of the higher - order effects .",
    "our results highlight that higher - order effects may have a primary role for the birth of spatiotemporal transitions in mixed gain / loss systems , suggesting further investigations .",
    "first of all , in the framework of the model we considered herein , it would be particularly interesting to investigate more broadly the full six - parameter space , rather than its low - dimensional projection considered herein .",
    "furthermore , another interesting direction would be the identification of a low - dimensional attractor , its dimension and dependence on the spatial length @xcite , as well as the construction of the appropriate finite - dimensional reduced systems able to capture the effective low dimensional dynamics @xcite .",
    "lastly , it would also be interesting to investigate the role of higher - order effects in other autonomous systems with gain and loss .",
    "in this appendix , we define an extended dynamical system associated to the initial - boundary value problem ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) . in particular , we briefly sketch the proof for the existence of a limit set - attractor , capturing all bounded orbits of this dynamical system , which initiate from sufficiently smooth initial data ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the starting point of our proof is the power balance equation @xcite : @xmath218 satisfied by any local solution @xmath219 , h^k_{per}(\\omega))$ ] , which initiates from sufficiently smooth initial data @xmath220 , for fixed @xmath221 . here",

    "this allows for the definition of the extended dynamical system @xmath227 whose orbits are bounded @xmath228 .",
    "moreover , from the above asymptotic estimate , we derive , that if @xmath52 is endowed with the equivalent averaged norm @xmath229 then its ball @xmath230 attracts all bounded sets @xmath231 .",
    "that is , there exists @xmath232 , such that @xmath233 , for all @xmath234 .",
    "thus , we may define for any bounded set @xmath235 , @xmath221 , its @xmath236-limit set in @xmath52 , @xmath237 the closures are taken with respect to the weak topology of @xmath52 .",
    "then , the standard ( embedding ) properties of sobolev spaces imply that the attractor @xmath238 is at least weakly compact in @xmath52 , or relatively compact in the dual space @xmath239 . for any initial condition ( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath240 , we denote its limit set by @xmath241 .",
    "in this appendix we provide the modulational instability analysis of the cw state : @xmath242 ( where @xmath243 is a real constant ) , which is an exact analytical solution of eq .",

    "this solution exists when the following dispersion relation holds : @xmath244 while @xmath245 , to suppress any exponential growth .",

    "now consider a small perturbation to this cw solution @xmath246e^{{\\rm i}\\theta(x , t)},\\ ] ] inserted into eq .  .",
