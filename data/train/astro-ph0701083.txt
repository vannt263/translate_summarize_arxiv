    "[ sec : intro ]    @xcite first introduced the idea of fallback in supernovae , attributing it to accretion in the rarefaction behind the outgoing shock .",
    "@xcite discussed fallback in supernovae extensively and emphasized that greater accretion would occur in compact progenitors . for sn 1987a , a blue supergiant , chevalier estimated a relatively large fallback mass of @xmath20.1 @xmath0 , and , for the more common type ii supernovae from red supergiants , a value roughly 100 times smaller .",
    "he also found , using self - similarity arguments , that the accretion rate at late times when expansion dominated should scale as @xmath3 , and emphasized the role of the reverse shock in fallback ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite studied fallback numerically in a variety of supernovae with different masses and compositions , and emphasized black hole formation as an important outcome for stars of higher mass and lower metallicity , with important ramifications for their nucleosynthesis .",
    "@xcite studied fallback numerically in a 25 @xmath0  supernova with varying explosion energy and discussed the relevance of fallback for producing gamma - ray bursts .    thus far , however , there has been no systematic study of fallback in stars with a very low metal content to determine the properties of gravitational remnants that might have existed following a first generation of stars .",
    "it has also been some time since the remnant masses of solar metallicity stars were systematically explored @xcite , and no such studies have included the effects of mass loss .",
    "calculations of fallback can be greatly influenced by the way the inner boundary is handled @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true in cases where a piston or reflecting inner boundary has been used to simulate the explosion and is still present in the calculation at late times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as we shall see , for modern supernovae that are red giants when they die , the error introduced by this artificial inner boundary is small , but it can become appreciable for zero metallicity stars with a much larger amount of fallback . since the material that falls back must be subtracted from the element production for a given star , our results are also relevant for calculations of nucleosynthesis and ( radioactive - powered ) light curves .",
    "we do not study fallback in stars above 100 @xmath0  and leave out the effects of rotation . above 100 @xmath0  and below 260@xmath0 , non - rotating stars encounter the pair instability and either lose their outer layers before explosion ( pulsational pair instability ) or explode completely without fallback . above 260 @xmath0 , they collapse to black holes @xcite .",
    "we also study here only single stars , not binaries .",
    "the complications introduced by rotation and binary membership could be included in future studies .",
    "a _ very _ approximate mapping between the results of binary and single star evolution can be obtained by comparing two stars with the same final helium core ( or carbon - oxygen core ) and explosion energy @xcite .",
    "core masses for zero metallicity and solar metallicity stars are given here and in @xcite .",
    "however , one of our main results here is that the mass and radius of the hydrogen envelope also greatly affect the fall back and therefore the remnant mass .",
    "the structure of the entire star must be considered , not just its core mass .",
    "similar caveats apply to the effects of rotation .",
    "rotation tends to increase the helium core mass and thus make larger black holes for a given main sequence mass .",
    "however , a correct calculation of the remnant mass involves not only the central engine ( possibly affected by rotation ) and the core mass , but also the mass and radius of the hydrogen envelope .",
    "we also do not include in our study any asymptotic giant branch stars .",
    "stars less massive than about 9 @xmath0  develop cores of either carbon and oxygen or neon , oxygen and magnesium that are increasingly degenerate .",
    "the core mass is thus limited by the chandrasekhar mass , 1.39 @xmath0  ( for an electron mole number , @xmath4 = 0.50 ) . the fraction of such stars that produce neutron stars is probably small for solar metallicity @xcite , but could be large at low metallicity @xcite .",
    "it is uncertain what fraction , if any , of these stars actually reach the chandrasekhar mass without first losing their envelope to winds and instabilities , and those with carbon - rich cores will produce thermonuclear supernovae , not neutron stars .",
    "for any that do make neutron stars , fall back is likely to be negligible and the baryonic masses of remnants will be @xmath21.39 @xmath0 .",
    "correcting for neutrino losses , the neutron star gravitational mass would be @xmath21.26 @xmath0 . because of uncertain statistics , such neutron stars are not included in our analysis , but could be by others .",
    "[ sec : initmod ]    the supernova models studied here are taken from two recent surveys by @xcite and @xcite . in each case , stars of various masses and metallicities were evolved using the kepler code @xcite through all stable stages of nuclear burning until their iron cores became unstable to collapse .",
    "the stars were then exploded using pistons located at or near the edge of their iron cores . for a discussion of how the piston was located and moved , and for further details of these explosion models , see @xcite .",
    "the first of these surveys examined the evolution and simulated explosion of approximately 120 massive stars with masses in the range 10 - 100 @xmath0  and zero initial metallicity ( hence population iii ; table  [ tab : pre - sn - zero ] ) .",
    "heger and woosley explored twelve different choices of explosion energy and piston location for each mass .",
    "while results are given for all of them in the tables , the discussion here focuses on just five .",
    "the model names are given by a capital letter `` z '' , for `` zero '' metallicity , followed by a letter indicating the piston location and explosion energy .",
    "four of these , series zb , zd , zg , and zj , had the piston located at that point in the star where the entropy equals 4.0@xmath5/baryon ( typically this occurs at the base of the oxygen burning shell ) and kinetic energies of 0.6 , 1.2 , 2.4 , and 10 b respectively ( henceforth 1 b = 1 bethe = 10@xmath6erg ) .",
    "series p had the piston located deeper in , at the edge of the deleptonized core ( where @xmath4 , drops precipitously below 0.5 due to electron capture ) and had an explosion energy of 1.2 b. note that the explosion energies quoted here are not the energy input by the piston , but rather the kinetic energy of the ejecta at infinity .",
    "the second survey treated a coarser grid of stellar masses ( 31 stars ) with solar metallicity and masses in the range 12 - 100@xmath0(table  [ tab : pre - sn - sollo03 ] ) .",
    "this survey is more appropriate to supernovae today in the milky way galaxy .",
    "greatest attention is paid here to series sa , which had the piston at the place in the star where the entropy per baryon , @xmath7 , equals 4.0 and an explosion energy of 1.2 b. except for metallicity effects then , series zd and sa are directly comparable .",
    "three other explosion models were also considered : sb which had the piston at the entropy = 4.0 point but had an explosion energy of 2.4 b ; sc , with the piston at the edge of the iron core ( mass fraction of nuclei heavier than chromium greater than 50% ) and an explosion energy of 1.2 b ; and sd , with the piston at the edge of the iron core and an explosion energy of 2.4 b.    models sc are thus the solar metallicity counterparts of models zp but with a slight difference .",
    "the zp models put the piston at the edge of the deleptonized core ; the sc models , at the edge of the iron core .",
    "the difference between these two cores in a given model is usually quite small and we do not think it has a major effect on the outcome .    tables  [ tab : pre - sn - zero ] and [ tab : pre - sn - sollo03 ] give an overview of these presupernova models . see also @xcite and @xcite . for the solar case ,",
    "a few additional models were computed at low and high mass using the same code and physics as the original surveys .",
    "the tables give the initial mass of the star , its final mass ( for the pop iii stars , this is identical to the initial mass ) , the mass of the location where an entropy of @xmath8 is reached ( @xmath9 ) , the size of the core where extensive electron capture has occurred ( @xmath10 core ) , the binding energies outside these two cores ( binding energy minus internal energy ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , and the final radius of the star ( @xmath13 ) . in the @xmath14 column , `` wnl ''",
    "indicates a hydrogen - rich wolf - rayet ( wr ) star and `` wc''/``wo '' indicate early - type hydrogen - free wr stars .",
    "such wr stars have optically thick winds with a photospheric `` effective radius '' located in this wind regime . among the hydrogen - free wr stars",
    ", we found only the carbon - rich and oxygen - rich subtypes ( wc and wo ) at presupernova , but no early - type hydrogen - free wr stars that only display the pure cno - processed n - rich he layer ( wne stars ) .",
    "there may be a very small transition regime between 40 and 45@xmath0where such wne stars occur .    at 45@xmath0 , wo stars start to be produced as material from a late helium burning stage in which oxygen dominates over carbon is exposed to the surface . at initial masses above",
    "@xmath15 carbon dominates over oxygen at the time the stars explodes .",
    "the final mass of the star becomes smaller having lower wr mass loss rates at the end and the stars lose mass from earlier phases of helium core burning .",
    "both effects increase the _ final _ carbon - to - oxygen ratio at the surface .",
    "[ sec : calculations ]    calculations were carried out using , pangu , a one - dimensional hydrodynamics code based on the second - order semi - discrete finite - difference central scheme of @xcite .",
    "time evolution is carried out by a third - order total variation diminishing runge - kutta method @xcite .",
    "we extended the scheme to spherical coordinates based on the conservative form of hydrodynamics equations .",
    "the treatment of spherical coordinates is the same as that in the ram code @xcite . in spherical coordinates , extra source terms",
    "are added to the equations . geometric correction to the surface area and volume of discretized numerical cells is applied when the numerical flux is used to update conserved variables ( density , momentum and total energy ) in the cells .    gravity is implemented as source terms of the hydrodynamics equations .",
    "a point mass is placed at the center of the grid .",
    "the gravitational force at a grid point is calculated from the enclosed mass , which includes the central point mass and mass of the material on the computational grid .",
    "the central point mass is being updated by keeping track of the mass flux across the inner boundary .",
    "the supernova models were linked from the kepler code , in which they were initially calculated , to the pangu code 100s after the shock wave had been initiated .",
    "this typically corresponded to a time when explosive nucleosynthesis had ended and the outgoing shock was just exiting the core of helium and heavy elements , before it had encountered any appreciable fraction of the hydrogen envelope . the reverse shock had thus not yet developed and , for the explosion energies considered ,",
    "no fallback had yet occurred .",
    "an outflow boundary condition was used at the inner boundary .",
    "that is , the ghost cells are simple duplicates of the first numerical cell on the grid .",
    "this type of boundary is very simple to implement .",
    "a potential problem of essentially any numerical boundary is small errors at the boundary could accumulate and affect the calculation . to avoid the problem",
    ", one should make sure that the flow across the boundary is supersonic .",
    "thus the information at the boundary can not propagate outwards and affect the upstream fluid . in our calculations ,",
    "the inner boundaries are chosen to be small enough to ensure the supersonic condition .",
    "however , it could be expensive to use a very small radius for the inner boundary because of the constrain of the courant - friedrichs - lewy condition .",
    "fortunately , the sound speed at the inner boundary is decreasing during fallback due to the decrease of temperature , whereas the infall velocity is increasing during fallback .",
    "therefore the sonic point is moving outwards over the time .",
    "calculations are performed in two steps to save computing time . in the first step",
    ", the numerical grid has an inner boundary at @xmath16 , which is also the inner boundary of the initial kepler models , and an outer boundary at @xmath17 .",
    "a logarithmic grid with 1000 zones is used for the @xmath18-direction .",
    "the region outside the star is filled with a low density medium with a pressure of @xmath19 , a density of @xmath20 and zero velocity .",
    "the calculation is run to @xmath21 .",
    "then the model is remapped to a new grid for the second step of calculations . for red giants",
    "in which the forward shock could have moved beyond the outer boundary at @xmath17 already at @xmath22 , the link to the second step is at an earlier time ( e.g. , @xmath23 ) so that the forward shock still presents at the second step .",
    "the grid for the second phase of calculations also has 1000 logarithmic zones , but the boundaries are at @xmath24 and @xmath25 . again the outside medium is set to a constant state with a pressure of @xmath26 , a density of @xmath27 and zero velocity .",
    "the second step of the calculation is run to at least @xmath28",

    "[ sec : results ]      two distinguishing properties of evolved pop iii stars are that they have lost little mass and also typically have more compact envelopes than modern stars .",
    "most of them die as hot blue stars . in some of the more massive stars",
    ", however , penetration of the convective helium burning core into the hydrogen envelope leads to the enrichment of the latter with super - solar abundances of carbon and nitrogen .",
    "hydrogen shell burning by the cno cycle then expands the star to supergiant proportions .",
    "another special case is stars around @xmath31 which begin to encounter the pulsational pair instability .",
    "strong pulses lead to the ejection of the entire hydrogen envelope and even parts of the helium core before the final core collapse ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this weakens the reverse shock in such stars .    in the usual case , however , the explosion of pop iii stars is accompanied by a stronger reverse shock and much more fallback than in their solar counterparts . since mass loss is likely",
    "to be greatly reduced in stars with no metals ( kudritzki 2002 , mokiem et al .",
    "2007 , though see also ekstrm , meynet , & maeder 2006 ) , higher main sequence mass implies a monotonically increasing helium core mass when the star dies , and along with it the potential for making more massive compact remnants , especially if the explosion energy is small .",
    "this is particularly interesting since several current simulations of primordial star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) predict rather high initial masses for these first stars .",
    "while not studied here , it is expected that still more massive stars ( i.e. , much above 100 @xmath0 ) , will encounter an increasingly violent pair instability leading to the complete disruption of the star and , eventually , above about 260 @xmath0 , the direct production of massive black holes without an initial supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "these limiting masses would be reduced by rotation .",
    "[ fig : comphydro ] shows the pressure , density , and velocity profiles at 100s , 200s , and 1000s as calculated in a typical pop iii model , z25d , using both pangu and kepler .",

    "the reverse shock forms as the expanding helium core runs into the star s hydrogen envelope ( where the quantity @xmath32 increases ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is decelerated .",

    "the forward shock at this time is located at 19.19@xmath0  and will shortly exit the star .    in the part of the star that is sonically disconnected from the origin , the results of kepler and pangu are in very good agreement .",
    "as time passes , however , there is an increasing discrepancy near the origin where pangu gives much higher collapse speeds than kepler , since the latter increasingly feels the effect of the reflecting inner boundary held fixed at @xmath34 . the inner boundary in pangu is also located at @xmath35 , but matter can flow through it without deceleration .",
    "the sonic radius at 1000 s is located at @xmath36 where the sound speed is @xmath37 .",
    "[ fig : mdot25 ] gives the accretion rate as a function of time calculated by pangu for this model .",
    "there are clearly four stages to the accretion : 1 ) an early rapid accretion of material that failed to achieve escape speed on the first try ; 2 ) a decline in accretion rate to an asymptotic dependence on t@xmath38 as appropriate for free expansion @xcite ; 3 ) a greatly enhanced fallback as the reverse shock arrives at the core at @xmath39 ; and 4 ) a final stage of free expansion .",
    "the final value of the remnant masses from pangu can be determined in two ways .",
    "after a sufficiently long time ( i.e. , a while after the reverse shock has arrived at the center ) , the inner part of the supernova will approach its asymptotic behavior .",
    "thus , the profiles of pressure , density and velocity near the center are very simple for the last dump of the simulation .",

    "this gives us a lower bound estimate of the final remnant mass .",
    "all material with a velocity larger than the escape velocity will be able to escape .",
    "this gives us an upper bound estimate of the mass .",
    "our first estimate is the average of the two bounds .",
    "the second estimate is based on the asymptotic behavior of the accretion rate , @xmath40 .",
    "using the point mass and accretion rate at the last dump of the simulation , we can get the second estimate by a simple analytic integration .",

    "explosion energies as great as 2.4 b would probably give type ii supernova light curves that are too bright @xcite .",
    "typical black hole masses are around 3 @xmath0  unless the explosion energy is very low .",
    "experimental estimates for the average black hole mass are hard to find , and it must be kept in mind that accurate values for the black hole mass can only come from binaries where the evolution might have been influenced by mass exchange .",
    "rotation can also affect the relation between helium core mass and main sequence mass and possibly lead to larger black holes .",
    "there is also a predisposition to find massive black holes since it is the mass that is taken as an indicator that the object is not a neutron star .",
    "still it is interesting that rather large values for black hole masses have been reported in systems that presumably were not particularly metal poor @xcite .",
    "either such systems have experienced an atypical evolution ( either of the black hole progenitor star or the black hole itself after it was born ) or the explosion energies are substantially less than what one commonly takes for type ii supernovae .    much better experimental calibrations are available for neutron star masses , though one still must be concerned about the favored selection of objects in close binary systems .",
    "the average neutron star masses for solar metallicity stars in table  [ tab : rem_org ] range from 1.33 to 1.47 @xmath0 .",
    "this is to be compared with , e.g. , estimates by @xcite of @xmath72 @xmath0  for 21 radio pulsars . while the agreement of the averages is impressive , it is also noteworthy that many neutron stars in our calculated data set have masses outside this range .",
    "in fact the lightest neutron star in our theoretical sample has a gravitational mass of 1.16 @xmath0  for the @xmath73 set and 1.08@xmath0for the iron core set .",
    "there are also numerous cases of neutron stars with gravitational masses around the maximum mass limit .",
    "two major deficiencies of the current study is that it does not include the effects of rotation or of binary interaction .",
    "the former will tend to increase the mass of the remnants for a given main sequence star since it leads to a larger helium core mass .",
    "the latter may lead to reduced masses for remnants , especially if the parent star loses its envelope early on to a companion and loses a lot more mass as a wolf - rayet star .",
    "both effects could be included in future studies .",
    "it would also be useful to explore a wider range of explosion energies for the solar metallicity stars .",
    "we plan such a survey , with mass and energy resolution more like the pop iii survey presented here , in the very near future .",
    "for now we note that the maximum mass black hole expected , even for low energy explosions , is approximately the mass of the heaviest helium core in a presupernova star , i.e. , 15 @xmath0  for solar metallicity stars and 40 @xmath0  for zero metallicity stars",
    "low metallicity stars above 260 @xmath0  can make heavier black holes @xcite and that threshold could be reduced by rotation .",
