    "topology optimization aims to distribute material within a design domain so that the designed product s physical properties can be optimized subject to certain geometric or physical constraints . due to its wide potential engineering applications and its intrinsic mathematical challenges ,",
    "this fundamental engineering problem has attracted researchers great interest since the seminal paper by bendsoe and kikuch  @xcite .",
    "the challenging problem is mathematically formulated in a discretized design domain of a large number of finite elements , taking as the design space , and the optimization goal is then to decide the void - solid or 0 - 1 distribution of these elements for maximal design performance , under volume fraction constraints or other types of constraints .",
    "let us consider an elastically deformable body that in an undeformed configuration occupies an open domain @xmath0 with ( lipschitz ) boundary @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the body is subjected to a body force @xmath2 ( per unit mass ) in the reference domain @xmath3 and a given surface traction @xmath4 of dead - load type on the boundary @xmath5 , while the body is fixed on the remaining boundary @xmath6 . based on the minimal potential principle in continuum mechanics ,",
    "the topology optimization of compliance minimization problem of this elastic body can be formulated in the following coupled minimization problem @xmath7 where the unknown @xmath8 is a displacement vector field , the design variable @xmath9 is a discrete scalar field , the stored energy per unit reference volume @xmath10 is a nonlinear differentiable function of the deformation gradient @xmath11 .",
    "the notation @xmath12 identifies a _ kinematically admissible space _ of deformations , in which , certain geometrical / boundary conditions are given , and @xmath13 is a design feasible space , in which , @xmath14 is the desired volume .",
    "mathematically speaking , the topology optimization @xmath15 is a coupled nonlinear - discrete minimization problem in infinite - dimensional space . for large deformation problems ,",
    "the stored energy @xmath10 is usually nonconvex .",
    "the criticality condition of this minimization problem leads to a nonlinear system of highly coupled partial differential equations .",
    "it is fundamentally difficult to analytically solve this type of problems .",
    "numerical methods must be adopted .",
    "finite element method is the most popular numerical approach for topology optimization , by which , the domain @xmath3 is divided into @xmath16 disjointed elements @xmath17 and in each element , the unknown fields can be numerically discretized as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an interpolation matrix , @xmath20 is a nodal displacement vector , the binary design variable @xmath21 is used for determining whether the element @xmath22 is a void ( @xmath23 ) or a solid ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , by substituting ( [ eq - urho ] ) into @xmath25 and let @xmath26 be an admissible nodal displacement space , _ a = \\ { = \\ { _ e } \\ { 0 , 1}^n | v ( ) = _ e=1^n _ e _ e v_c } , the variational problem @xmath15 can be numerically reformulated the following global optimization problem @xmath27 where c ( , ) = ^t ( ) , ( ) = \\ { _ _ e w ( ( ) _ e ) } ^n , ( ) = \\ { _ _ e _ e _ e()^t_e ( ) } + \\ { _ ^e_t ( ) ^t ( ) } ^m . clearly , this discretized topology optimization involves both the continuous variable @xmath28 and the integer variable @xmath29 , it is the so - called _ mixed integer nonlinear programming problem _ ( minlp ) in mathematical programming . since @xmath30 we have c_p ( , ) : = _ e=1^n _",
    "e^p c_e()= ( _ p ) ^t ( ) = c ( , ) p , where @xmath31 represents the hadamard product .",
    "particularly , for @xmath32 , we write c_2 ( , ) : = ^t ( ) , ( ) = 2 \\ { ( ) } .",
    "clearly , @xmath33 is a convex function of @xmath34 since @xmath35 . by the facts that @xmath29 is the main design variable and the displacement @xmath36 depends on each given domain @xmath3 , the problem @xmath37 is actually a so - called bi - level programming problem : @xmath38 in this formulation",
    ", @xmath39 represents the upper - level cost function and the total potential energy @xmath40 represents the lower - level cost function . for large deformation problems ,",
    "the total potential energy @xmath41 is usually a nonconvex function of @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , this bi - level optimization could be the most challenging problem in global optimization .    for linear elastic structures ,",
    "the total potential energy @xmath41 is a quadratic function of @xmath36 ( , ) = ^t ( ) - ^t ( ) where @xmath42 is the overall stiffness matrix , which is obtained by assembling the sub - matrix @xmath43 for each element @xmath44 . in this case , the lower - level optimization ( [ eq - llopt ] ) is a convex minimization and for each given upper - level design variable @xmath34 , the lower - level solution is simply governed by the linear equilibrium equation @xmath45 therefore , the topology optimization for linear elasticity is mathematically an linear constrained integer programming programming problem : [ eq - le ] ( _ le ) : _ _ a _ ^m_a \\ { c_p ( , ) | ( ) = ( ) } .",
    "particularly , it is a mixed integer linear programming if @xmath46 .",
    "however , due to the integer constraint , even this most simple linear programming problem has been considered as one of the most challenging tasks in topology optimization .",
    "only problems in very small scale have been tackled to global optimality  @xcite .    in order to overcome the combinatorics complexity of",
    ", various approximations were proposed in the last decades to resolve it , including homogenization  @xcite , density - based  @xcite , level set  @xcite , topological derivative  @xcite and so on .",
    "these approaches essentially tries to reformulate the problem into a continuous parameter optimization problem using size , density or shape , which can be solved efficiently based on gradient - based optimization algorithms . a very good and recent survey on topology optimization approaches is also referred to  @xcite .",
    "the approaches have produced various excellent results in the last decades using the approaches , and have also found industrial applications .",
    "the so - called simplified isotropic material with penalization ( simp ) is one of the most popular approaches in topology optimization : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the so - called penalization parameter in topology optimization .",
    "the simp formulation has been studied extensively in topology optimization and numerous research papers have been produced during the past decades . by the fact that @xmath49",
    ", we can see that the integer constraint @xmath50 in @xmath51 is simply replaced by the box constraint @xmath52^n$ ] .",
    "although it was discovered by engineers that the  magic number \" @xmath53 can ensure good convergence to almost @xmath54-@xmath55 solutions , the simp formulation @xmath56 is not mathematically equivalent to the topology optimization problem @xmath51 . actually , in many real - world applications , most simp solutions @xmath57 are only approximate to @xmath54 or @xmath55 but never be exactly @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "correspondingly , these elements are in gray scale which have to be filtered or interpreted physically .",
    "additionally , this method suffers some key limitations such as global optimization not ensured , gray scale element produced , and lacking rigorous mathematical verification , which will be discussed during the following part of the paper .",
    "in order to overcome these issues mentioned above , a novel discrete approach to resolve the topology optimization is proposed here using the canonical duality - triality theory , cdt theory for short .",
    "canonical dual finite element methods for solving elasto - plastic structures and large deformation problems have been studied since 1988 @xcite .",
    "applications to nonconvex mechanics are given recently for post - buckling problems @xcite .",
    "our attention in this paper mainly focuses on the canonical duality theory for solving the challenging integer programming problem in @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 , where @xmath60 represents the volume of each element @xmath44 .",
    "then we have @xmath61 . for a given optimal solution @xmath36 to the lower - level programming problem",
    ", the primal problem for the upper - level optimization in @xmath58 can be written in the following form ( @xmath62 for short ) : ( ): \\ { ( ) = c_p ( , ) | _ a } .",
    "this is a typical quadratic integer programming problem for @xmath63 .",
    "the canonical duality theory for solving this type of problems was first proposed by gao in 2007 @xcite .",
    "the key idea of this theory is the introducing of a canonical measure = ( ) = \\ { - , ^t -v_c } : ^n = ^n+1 .",
    "let _ a : = \\ { = \\ { , } ^n+1| 0 , 0 } be a convex cone in @xmath64 .",
    "its indicator @xmath65 is defined by @xmath66 which is a convex and lower semi - continuous ( l.s.c ) function in @xmath64 . by this function",
    ", the primal problem can be relaxed in the following unconstrained minimization form : \\ { ( ) = c_p ( , ) + ( ( ) ) | ^n } . due to the convexity of @xmath65 ,",
    "its conjugate function can be defined uniquely by the fenchel transformation : ^ * ( ) = _ ^n+1 \\ { ^t - ( ) } = \\ {    ll 0 & _ a^ * + + &    .",
    "where @xmath67 is the dual space of @xmath68 .",
    "thus , by using the fenchel - young equality @xmath69 , the function @xmath70 can be written in the gao - strang total complementary function @xcite ( , ) = c_p ( , ) + ( ) ^t - ^ * ( ) .",
    "based on this function , the canonical dual of @xmath70 can be defined by ^d ( ) = \\ { ( , ) | ^m } = c^_p ( , ) - ^ * ( ) where @xmath71 stands for finding a stationary value of @xmath72 , and c^_p ( , ) = \\ { ( ) ^t + c_p ( , ) } is the @xmath73-conjugate of @xmath74 .",
    "its format depends on @xmath75 and , particularly , for @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xmath79 clearly , @xmath80 is well - defined if @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath85 .",
    "we have the following standard result in the canonical duality theory :    for any given @xmath86 and @xmath28 , if @xmath87 is a kkt point of @xmath88 , then @xmath89 is a kkt point of @xmath90 , @xmath91 is a kkt point of @xmath92 , and ( ) = ( , ) = ^d().[eq - cdp ]    by the convexity of @xmath65 , we have the following canonical duality relations : [ eq - cdr ] ( ) ^ * ( ) ( ) + ^ * ( ) = ^t , where @xmath93 is the sub - differential of @xmath94 .",
    "thus , in terms of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the canonical duality relations ( [ eq - cdr ] ) can be equivalently written as - 0 0 ^t ( - ) = 0 [ eq - kkts ] ^t - v_c 0 0 ( ^t - v_c ) = 0 .",
    "[ eq - kktv ] these are exactly the kkt conditions for the inequality constraints @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "thus , @xmath87 is a kkt point of @xmath88 if and only if @xmath89 is a kkt point of @xmath90 , @xmath91 is a kkt point of @xmath92 .",
    "the equality ( [ eq - cdp ] ) holds due to the canonical duality relations in ( [ eq - cdr ] ) .",
    "@xmath99    indeed , on the effective domain @xmath100 of @xmath101 , the total complementary function @xmath88 can be written as ( , , ) = c_p ( , ) + ^t ( - ) + ( ^t - v_c ) , which can be considered as the lagrangian of @xmath15 for the canonical constraint @xmath102 .",
    "the lagrange multiplier @xmath103 must satisfy the kkt conditions in ( [ eq - kkts ] ) and ( [ eq - kktv ] ) . by the complementarity condition",
    "@xmath104 we know that @xmath105 iff @xmath106 .",
    "a^+ = \\ { = \\ { , } _ a^ * | > 0 } . then for any given @xmath107 ,",

    "is a global optimal solution to @xmath15 and ( ) = _ ^n ( ) = _",
    "^+_a ^d ( ) = ^d ( ) .",
    "it is easy to prove that for any given @xmath28 , the canonical dual function @xmath114 is concave on the open convex set @xmath115 . if @xmath91 is a kkt point of @xmath114 , then it must be a unique global maximizer of @xmath114 on @xmath115 . by theorem 1",
    "we know that if @xmath116 is a kkt point of @xmath117 , then @xmath118 defined by ( [ eq - solu ] ) must be a kkt point of @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath119 is a saddle function on @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 since @xmath122 , the complementarity condition in ( [ eq - kkts ] ) leads to @xmath123 thus , we have @xmath124 as required .",

    "numerically speaking , although the global optimal solution of the integer programming problem @xmath15 can be obtained by solving the canonical dual problem @xmath113 , the rate of convergence is very slow since @xmath125 is nearly a linear function of @xmath126 when @xmath127 is far from its origin . in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "a so - called @xmath128-perturbed canonical dual method has been proposed by gao and ruan in integer programming @xcite , i.e. by introducing a perturbation parameter @xmath129 , the problem @xmath113 is replaced by ( ^d _ ) : \\",

    "it is easy to show that for any given @xmath129 , @xmath138 is strictly concave on the open convex set @xmath115 , i.e. @xmath134 has a unique solution .",
