    "adequate interpretation of the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of globular clusters ( gcs ) is important for many astrophysical and cosmological reasons .",
    "the horizontal branch ( hb ) evolutionary phase plays a particularly significant role in that regard .",
    "because the observational properties of hb stars are extremely sensitive to the physical parameters of gcs , hb stars can impose invaluable constraints on the initial conditions that characterized the galaxy in its infancy .",
    "metallicity , [ fe / h ] , is the  first parameter \" influencing hb morphology : metal - rich clusters have , in general , more red hb stars than blue hb stars and _ vice versa _ for the metal - poor gcs .",
    "the existence of gcs which have the same [ fe / h ] but different hb morphologies indicates that one or more second parameters exists . despite the fact that the problem has received much attention since it was first discovered ( sandage & wildey 1967 ) , the second parameter(s ) responsible for the spread in hb types at a given [ fe / h ] has ( have )",
    "not been firmly established .",
    "understanding the second parameter is arguably one of the most important tasks that must be accomplished before the age and formation history of the galaxy can be reliably determined ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ; van den bergh 1993 ; zinn 1993 ; lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 ; majewski 1994 ) .",
    "much recent debate has focused on whether the predominant second parameter is age ( e.g. , lee et al . 1994 ; stetson , vandenberg , & bolte 1996 ; sarajedini , chaboyer , & demarque 1997 ; catelan 2000 ; catelan , ferraro , & rood 2001b ; catelan et al . 2001a",
    "; vandenberg 2000 ) , but mass loss , helium and @xmath5-element abundances , rotation , deep mixing , binary interactions , core concentration , and even planetary systems have been suggested as second parameters .",
    "it is likely that the second parameter phenomenon is in fact a combination of several individual quantities and phenomena related to the formation and chemodynamical evolution of each individual star cluster , implying that the several individual second - parameter candidates have to be  weighted \" on a case - by - case basis ( e.g. , fusi pecci et al .",

    ". some randomly selected samples of simulations for this bimodal mass distribution case are displayed , in the [ @xmath129 , @xmath130 plane , in fig .",
    "the predicted hb morphology parameters for this case are also shown in table  4 ( fourth column ) .",
    "we find that the intrinsically bimodal mass distribution case provides a much more satisfactory fit to the whole set of hb morphology parameters than does the unimodal case . to some extent , this is not an unexpected result , given that this case contains five free parameters , as opposed to two in the unimodal one ( catelan et al .",
    "the main difference between the bimodal and unimodal cases , as can be readily appreciated by inspection of figs .",
    "11 and 12 , is that the unimodal case clearly predicts that a fairly extended blue tail should be present in m75 , whereas this is not necessarily required in the bimodal case .",
    "also in this respect , apart from a few cases where statistical fluctuations change the predicted simulations quite substantially , the bimodal case appears much more successful at matching the observed distribution , showing , in general , a more stubby blue hb with relatively few hot stars being in general expected .",
    "note , however , that neither the unimodal nor the bimodal cases shown in figs .",
    "11 and 12 can successfully account for the existence of a third mode of hotter hb stars along the blue tail of m75 ( see also fig .",
    "10 , bottom panel ) .",
    "grundahl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have recently shown that the interpretation of strmgren @xmath139 photometry of blue hb stars in gcs is affected by a most intriguing phenomenon : at temperatures higher than @xmath140  k , all gc cmds show an intriguing  jump \" in the @xmath139 , @xmath141 plane , with all blue hb stars hotter than 11,500  k appearing brighter and/or hotter than predicted by the models . as argued by grundahl et al . , and spectacularly confirmed by behr et al . ( 1999 ) ,",
    "the reason for this discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that the atmospheres of hot hb stars in gcs are affected by radiative levitation of metals , which pumps up heavy metals to supersolar levels in these stars atmospheres .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "10 ( bottom panel ) , a similar jump is present also in broadband @xmath2 , with all stars blueward than @xmath142 falling systematically above the canonical zahb .",
    "the displayed zahb sequence corresponds to vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) models for @xmath3 } = -1.14 $ ] and @xmath66 = + 0.3 $ ] , and were transformed to the observational plane using standard prescriptions from kurucz ( 1992)which assume that the cluster metallicity is appropriate also for the atmospheres of hotter blue hb stars .",
    "it is worth noting that the grundahl jump phenomenon in broadband @xmath2 has recently been verified also by siegel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , bedin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and markov , spassova , & baev ( 2001 ) .",
    "the presence of the jump phenomenon in broadband @xmath2 is in good agreement with the radiative levitation scenario , as can be seen from inspection of fig .",

    "( 1999 ) .      on the basis of their location in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath104 ) cmd",
    ", we identified a sample of 26 candidate bss .",
    "the @xmath143 and @xmath144 coordinates ( in pixels ) and @xmath2 , @xmath28 , @xmath1 , @xmath29 magnitudes and distance from the cluster center ( in arcmin ) for these candidate bss are listed in table  5 .",
    "[ fig13 ] shows zoomed m75 cmds where the bss candidates are plotted as encircled dots . as can be seen , all the candidates selected in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath104 ) plane lie also in the bss region in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath104 ) cmd .",
    "moreover , the latter cmd suggests that a few additional objects might be considered bss candidates .",
    "we conservatively decided , however , to limit our analysis to those stars which are bss candidates in both the indicated cmds .",
    "careful checks were made to ensure that the internal errors of the bss candidates are the same as those of the subgiant branch ( sgb ) stars at the same brightness level .",
    "the daophot parameters sharp and chi were checked for each bss candidate , in order to ensure that most are unlikely to be the result of spurious photometric blends ( e.g. , ferraro , fusi pecci , & buonanno 1992 ) .",
    "the positions of the bss were checked on the statistically decontaminated cmds .",
    "the number of field stars is not sufficient to explain the bss population ( see also fig .  2 ) .    in order to quantitatively",
    "compare the bss populations among different galactic gcs , one needs to suitably normalize the numbers of such stars . in this sense ,",
    "ferraro et al . ( 1999b ) defined the specific fraction of bss as the number of bss normalized to the number of hb stars observed in the same cluster region , @xmath145 . in m75 , the specific frequency calculated in this way is @xmath146 .",
    "generally , bss are more centrally concentrated with respect to the other stars in the cluster , although there are notable exceptions to this general rule , such as m3 ( ferraro et al .",
    "1993 , 1997 ) and m13 ( paltrinieri et al . 1998 ) .",
    "in m75 we compared the radial distribution of bss with respect to sgb stars ( in the range @xmath147 ) .",
    "the cumulative radial distributions are plotted , as a function of the projected distance ( @xmath148 ) from the cluster center , in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , where one sees that the m75 bss ( circles ) are more centrally concentrated than the sgb sample ( diamonds ) .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the probability of drawing the two populations from the same distribution is @xmath149 .",
    "two main methods are currently used to measure relative ages : _ ( i ) _ the so - called _ vertical _ method  based on the to luminosity with respect to the hb level ( buonanno , corsi , & fusi pecci 1989 ) and _ ( ii ) _ the _ horizontal _ method  based on the accurate determination of the color difference @xmath150 between the base of the rgb and the to ( vandenberg , bolte , & stetson 1990 ) .",
    "admittedly , our photometry in the [ @xmath60 , @xmath1 ] plane is not sufficiently accurate to derive precise color difference measures down to the to region .",
    "in addition , the horizontal method is so intrinsically sensitive to small variations in colour that even small ( @xmath152  mag ) uncertainties in the registration of the mean ridge lines could generate large ( @xmath153  gyr ) , `` artificial '' differences in the derived ages . for this reason , in order to obtain a relative age for m75 , we applied only the vertical method .    in doing this",
    ", we perform a comparison with respect to another cluster with similar metallicity and hb morphology  namely , ngc  1851 .",
    "recent photometry in the [ @xmath62 , @xmath1 ] plane has been published for ngc1851 by bellazzini et al .",

    "15 , while both the hb and the sgb / to regions of the two clusters nicely agree , a small difference in colour in the brightest region of the rgb does exist between the two data sets",
    ". this small colour residual could in principle be due to a small difference in the _ global _ metallicity between the two clusters , although the metallicity value derived in  3.2 for m75 is very similar to that from ferraro et al .",

    "( 1993 ) formula , eq .",
    "( 1 ) above , is not based on the latest evolutionary models available in the literature , they are still expected to give sufficiently accurate _ relative _ ages , under the hypothesis that both clusters have the same chemical composition .",
    "in this paper , we have provided the first ccd photometry for the distant gc m75 .",
    "we confirm a previous suggestion ( catelan et al .",
    "1998a ) that this cluster contains two main modes on the hb , and show that the cluster actually has a _ third _ mode on the blue tail , clearly separated from the bulk of the blue hb by a wide gap , encompassing about 3000  k in temperature . in cmds",
    "utilizing broadand @xmath2 magnitudes , these hotter hb stars are found to be clearly inconsistent with canonical evolutionary models , showing that the  grundahl jump \" phenomenon ( grundahl et al .",
    "1999 ) can be studied using broadband @xmath2 besides strmgren @xmath139 .",
    "we also find a population of centrally concentrated bss in m75 .",

    "we find that the two clusters have essentially the same age .",
    "this is an interesting result , in view of the fact that ngc  1851 itself has been argued to be slightly younger than other gcs of similar metallicity ( bellazzini et al .",
    "2001 and references therein )",
    ". however , better photometry is needed to conclusive demonstrate that m75 too is younger than the average for its metallicity .",
    "what is the physical reason for the hb multimodality in m75 ? at present , this remains unclear .",
    "similar anomalies in hb morphology have been seen in other clusters , and the suggested explanations ",
    "none of which is seemingly capable of accounting for all the peculiarities  usually involve environmental effects , stellar rotation , abundance anomalies , mass loss in rgb stars , binarity , and even planets ( e.g. , sosin et al . 1997 and references therein ) . in the case of m75 , we are in a bad position to analyze most of these factors , given the lack of spectroscopic data for the cluster stars .",
    "however , at least as far as the hb bimodality ( i.e. , relative absence of rr lyrae stars , compared with both blue and red hb stars ) is concerned , we can make use of rr lyrae pulsation properties in order to investigate the presence of any non - canonical effects that might impact their pulsational properties in a significant way . this could at least differentiate processes which affect hb morphology by means solely of rgb mass loss from those that may affect not only the hb star masses , but also their luminosities ( catelan , sweigart , & borissova 1998b ) . similarly , useful constraints can thereby be placed on the origin of m75 s peculiar @xmath9-ratio .    with this in mind",
