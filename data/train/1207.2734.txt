    "challenge when determining the performance of a block error - correcting code is to measure its bit - error rate ( ber ) , which quantifies the reliability of the system . in practice ,",
    "the ber estimation for a single code is simple , just send data and divide the errors committed among the total number of bits .",
    "however , it would be too costly and time - consuming if a comparative between several codes is required .",
    "mathematical software packages for encoding and decoding are very limited and restricted to specific codes and simulations would consume a huge amount of time when dealing with low bit - error rates .",
    "for this reason , a theoretical approach to the measurement of the ber is proposed by several authors in the literature , see for instance @xcite .",
    "all these papers follow this scheme of codification : let @xmath0 be a code of length @xmath1 and dimension @xmath2 over the field with @xmath3 elements , being @xmath4 .",
    "an @xmath1-tuple is transmitted through a @xmath3-ary symmetric discrete memoryless channel . in this step , there are two possibilities , the transmission is right or failed in some symbols . in a second step ,",
    "the code corrects the @xmath1-tuple , detects an erroneous transmission but does not correct it , or asserts that the transmitted @xmath1-tuple is a codeword .",
    "finally , there is a comparison between the encoded and decoded @xmath1-tuples , see figure [ f1 ] .",

    "2 .   a right correction ( rc ) , i.e.",
    ", some of the symbols are incorrectly received but the decoding algorithm corrects them .",
    "an error detection ( ed ) , i.e. , the number of errors exceeds the error - correction capability of the code , the block is not corrected and the bad transmission is detected .",
    "4 .   a wrong correction ( wc ) , i.e.",
    ", some errors occur ( beyond the error capability of the code ) , there is a code - correction , but nevertheless , the encoded block differs from the decoded block .",
    "5 .   a false negative ( fn ) , i.e. , some symbols are incorrectly received but the whole block is a codeword , so , from the receiver s point of view , the block is correctly received .",
    "cases fn and wc are called undetected errors in @xcite , and it is proven that , for maximum - distance - separable ( mds ) codes , the probability of an undetected error decreases monotonically as the channel symbol error decreases , that is , mds codes are proper in the terminology of @xcite . hence , the performance of an mds code is characterized by the probability that an erroneous transmission will remain undetected . in @xcite , as a performance criterion , the probability of an ed is added and an exhaustive calculus of the word , symbol , and bit  error rate of ed , wc , and fn is made .    in this paper , we propose a refinement in the calculi of the probability of an fn , a wc , and an ed .",
    "consequently , we get a better approximation of the ber for a @xmath3-ary mds code . as in the above references , we consider a bounded distance reproducing decoder , i.e.",
    ", it reproduces the received word whenever there are uncorrectable errors .",
    "the underlying idea consists in removing the symbol errors produced in the redundancy part of the decoded @xmath1-tuple , that is , following the nomenclature of @xcite , unlike the aforementioned papers , we estimate the information  bit error rate ( iber ) , sometimes also called post - decoding bit  error rate .",
    "more formally , let us assume , without loss of generality , that the codification is systematic and the first @xmath2 symbols of the @xmath1-tuples form an information set .",
    "hence , following the above scheme , after the comparison step , if there are @xmath6 errors , the symbol - error proportion is @xmath7 . nevertheless , some of these errors belong to the redundancy part and they will not spread in the final post - decoded @xmath2-tuple . in other words , a new variable should be considered : the comparison between the original block and the final @xmath2-tuple obtained after decoding , see figure [ f2 ] .",

    ", some errors affect the information set .",

    ", all errors belong to the redundancy part .",
    "so , from the point of view of the receiver , there are uncorrectable errors but , indeed , the post - decoded block is right",
    ".    then , a study of the ber should consider the probability of obtaining a false positive after the post - decoding process and , hence , the criterion for measuring the performance of the code should be the probability of undetected and ped errors .    all along this paper",

    "the code is @xmath17-ary , so the probability for a symbol of being correctly received is @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the expected probability of transition between any two symbols , the channel symbol - error rate , is the average of all possible cases , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "finally , if we want to know the probability for a bit to be erroneous inside an erroneous symbol , we simply give the conditional probability @xmath20 .",

    "as we pointed out in the introduction , there exists the possibility of occurrence of an fp . up to our knowledge , this has not been treated before in the literature . in this section ,",
    "we calculate the probability that a ped and an fp occur , finishing our estimation of the iber of an mds code .",
    "as we noticed above , without loss of generality , we may suppose that the zero word is transmitted and we want to analyze the behaviour of the received word .",
    "our purpose now is to count the words whose weight decomposes as @xmath262 , i.e. there are no non - zero information symbols , which are not corrected by the decoder . obviously ,",
    "if @xmath263 , the word shall be properly corrected , so we assume that @xmath264 .",
    "two disjoint cases can take place : the error is detected but not corrected , producing an fp , or the error is ( wrongly ) corrected to a codeword . since the total number of such words is given by @xmath265 it is enough to calculate the words corresponding to one of the two cases .",
    "we can make use of the calculations in section [ s3 ] and give an expression of the words belonging to the second case .",
    "indeed , the number of words of weight @xmath131 with @xmath266 that are corrected to a codeword is as follows : @xmath267 hence , the number of false positives of weight @xmath131 is given by @xmath268 and the probability of producing a false positive is given by the following formula @xmath269    it can be observed in figure [ graphfp ] that the probability of a fp has a maximum for each code .",
    "when the channel ber is high enough this probability increases as the error correction capability of the code increases , see figure [ graphfp2 ] .    0.45   of length 127 and dimension @xmath2.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.45   of length 127 and dimension @xmath2.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we may now give an estimation of the iber of a ped . indeed , when the received word has a weight greater than @xmath181 , the error - correcting capability of the code , three disjoint cases can take place : an undetected error , an fp , or a ped .",
    "hence , for a given weight @xmath270 , the number of words producing a ped is given by @xmath271 whenever @xmath272 and zero otherwise .",
    "therefore , @xmath273    the reader may observe from figures [ graphped0 ] that , for high channel ber s , the behaviour of the iber of a ped becomes almost linear . actually , the curves approximate to the line @xmath274 according the dimension of the code diminishes .",
