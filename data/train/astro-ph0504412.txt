    "an important result from the @xmath16 observatory was the discovery of large numbers of galaxies which emit prodigiously in the infrared . the @xmath16 bright galaxy survey ( _ bgs _ , flux limited , @xmath175.4 jy ; soifer et al 1987 , 1989 ) reported on infrared fluxes of 330 galaxies .",
    "an interesting subset of these objects , coined luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath18 ) , and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , @xmath19 ) , serve as a unique tool to better understand the temporal evolution of starburst phenomena ( the field is reviewed by sanders & mirabel , 1996 ) .",
    "as evidenced by morphological studies , ulirgs are likely the product of galaxy mergers , or strongly interacting galaxies ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 , lawrence et al .",
    "1991 , leech et al .",
    "while many lirgs are also merger remnants , they can also be gas and/or dust - rich spirals .",
    "the source of infrared luminosity in ulirgs and high luminosity lirgs has been under contention for quite some time .",
    "the luminous activity from the central regions in lirgs / ulirgs suggests either a massive starburst , dust enshrouded agn , or some combination of the two .",
    "high resolution ( @xmath51@xmath20 ) millimeter observations have shown large amounts of molecular gas concentrated in the nuclear regions of these galaxies ( e.g. scoville et al . , 1989 , bryant & scoville 1999 ) .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that galaxy mergers can efficiently drive gas toward the nuclear regions of the remnants ( barnes & hernquist 1992 , mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "nearly all bright @xmath16 galaxies have been found to be rich in molecular gas ( tinney et al .",
    "1990 , sanders , scoville & soifer 1991 , hereafter sss91 ) .",
    "this molecular gas is not only the nascent birthplace for massive star formation , but may also act as fuel for a hidden agn .",
    "additionally , the processes may be linked .",
    "several authors have suggested that the large amounts of gas may lead to the buildup of large nuclear star clusters which may augment the formation for a central agn ( scoville et al .",
    "1989 , surace et al .",
    "1998 , evans et al .",
    "1999 , scoville et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "strong constraints must be placed on the interstellar medium ( ism ) in lirgs / ulirgs in order to better understand the source of luminosity and their role in the evolutionary sequence of galaxies .",
    "rotational transitions in carbon monoxide are often used as a tracer for molecular gas in the ism .",
    "the first extensive studies of the molecular gas in lirgs / ulirgs via @xmath4co ( hereafter , co ) line emission were presented by tinney et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , and sss91 .",
    "these authors analyzed co ( j=1 - 0 ) emission from a sample galaxies with @xmath2110@xmath22 l@xmath23 .",
    "of particular interest in the ism is the properties of warm , dense gas , as it is this gas that directly traces star formation .",
    "because co ( j=1 - 0 ) can be excited at relatively low temperatures ( @xmath55 k above ground ) and densities ( @xmath510@xmath24@xmath8 ) , it serves as a good tracer for total molecular gas , but is relatively insensitive to the warmer , denser gas directly involved in the star formation process .",
    "in contrast , high lying rotational transitions of co directly trace warm , dense gas .",
    "the j=3 level of co lies 33k above ground and has a relatively high critical density of 1.5@xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "the co ( j=3 - 2 ) transition can serve as a tracer of dense molecular gas heated by active star formation , and thus as a diagnostic for the starburst phenomena in these galaxies . sensitivity to the presence of dense gas is important in determining the evolutionary state of lirgs / ulirgs .",
    "for example , in the well studied galaxy , arp 220 , solomon , downes & radford ( 1992 ) presented single dish data taken in co ( j=1 - 0 ) , hco+(j=1 - 0 ) , and hcn ( j=1 - 0 ) .",
    "the co ( j=1 - 0 ) spectra shows a single peak while the emission lines from the high - density tracers hco+ and hcn each showed two peaks .",
    "taniguchi & shioya ( 1998 ) discussed the double - horned profile seen in the high - density tracers hco+ and hcn as corresponding to the starburst regions associated with two separate nuclei in this galaxy .",
    "this model was further supported by high resolution observations by sakamoto et al .",
    "it is therefore evident that high - density gas tracers are vital to the understanding of molecular gas in lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "several previous surveys of lirgs and ulirgs have relied on millimeter - wave studies of hcn ( j=1 - 0 ) in order to probe the properties of the dense molecular component of these objects ( e.g. solomon , downes & radford , 1992 , gao & solomon 2004b , and references therein ) .",
    "however , the low lying levels of hcn do not necessarily trace gas that is both _",
    "warm and dense_. for example , the j=1 - 0 emission of hcn traces densities of @xmath25(h@xmath12 ) @xmath26 3 @xmath6 10@xmath27@xmath8 ; however , it only lies at a temperature of @xmath54.25k above the ground state .",
    "thus , while observations of this transition will reveal the physical conditions of dense molecular gas , both cool and warm , it does not necessarily probe the gas heated by active star formation . in order to study properties of the gas _ directly involved in star formation _ , one must look toward lines that have a high excitation temperature , as well as a high critical density .",
    "while there have been numerous studies of co ( j=1 - 0 ) emission ( sanders & mirabel , 1996 and references therein ) , there are relatively few studies of lirgs and ulirgs in higher lying co transitions .",
    "rigopoulou et al ( 1996 ) reported a co ( j=2 - 1 ) survey of 6 ulirgs , and yao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) presented the first survey of co(j=3 - 2 ) emission of lirgs and ulirgs from the scuba local universe galaxy survey ( slugs ) .",
    "recent high - resolution studies of warm - dense molecular gas in individual lirgs have been performed by iono et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    in order to better understand the role of star formation in lirgs and ulirgs , and",
    "how it varies with infrared luminosity , we have conducted a survey of co ( j=3 - 2 ) emission as a tracer for warm - dense molecular gas in 17 normal starburst spirals , lirgs and ulirgs detected by the _ iras bgs _ survey .",
    "we made these observations at the 10 m heinrich hertz submillimeter telescope ( hhsmt ) on mt .",

    "the galaxies in this study were selected from the iras _ bgs _ sample which was flux limited at @xmath28 5.4 jy .",
    "all but two of the objects observed here have previously shown strong co ( j=1 - 0 ) emission ( mirabel et al . 1990 , tinney et al .",
    "1990 , sss91 , yao et al . 2004 ) and were therefore known to be rich in molecular gas .",

    "a high ratio ( @xmath261 ) indicates the gas is warm , and optically thin .    because the co ( j=3 - 2 ) and ( j=1 - 0 ) observations were taken at different telescopes with different beam sizes , certain considerations must be taken into account when comparing the line intensities .",

    "in contrast , co(j=3 - 2 ) traces warm , dense gas heated by embedded stars (  1 ) and thus @xmath9/co(j=3 - 2 ) probes the infrared luminosity as a function of _ recent star formation_. it follows then , that the linear relationship seen between @xmath9 and @xmath49 implies that the sfr per unit _ dense _ molecular gas mass remains constant through log(@xmath61 12.3 ; this result is confirmed by our observed relationship between @xmath62 and @xmath48 which shows a nearly constant sfr as a function of warm - dense molecular gas heated by active star formation .",
    "these observations strengthen the conclusion of gao & solomon ( 2004b ) that the ir luminosity in lirgs and ulirgs up to an ir luminosity of at least log(@xmath9 )",
    "@xmath5 12.3 is primarily driven by heating from o and b stars .",
    "the observed linear relationships suggest that star formation does play an important role in powering the infrared luminosity in lirgs and ulirgs",
    ". however , it may be that this relationship breaks down at higher ir luminosities as possible agn contribution becomes more important . as an example , we extrapolate our fit to observations of hyperluminous infrared galaxies ( hlirgs ) . extrapolating from our fit ,",
    "a galaxy with log@xmath63@xmath513 would require @xmath54 @xmath610@xmath64m@xmath23 of warm - dense molecular gas in the nuclear regions . for comparison ,",
    "the hlirg fsc 10214 + 4274 has @xmath65=1.8@xmath610@xmath66l@xmath23 and co ( j=3 - 2)-traced warm - dense gas mass of @xmath67= 2.2@xmath610@xmath64 m@xmath23 ( an upper limit as the luminosity may have been enhanced by gravitational lensing , close et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ) ; similarly , hlirg fsc 15307 + 3252 has @xmath68=1.3@xmath610@xmath69l@xmath23 and has an upper limit of warm - dense gas mass ( as measured from co j=4 - 3 observations ) of @xmath70 10@xmath22 m@xmath23 .",
    "both are believed to have central agn as their main source for infrared luminosity ( yun & scoville 1998 ) .",
    "the disparity in the measured versus predicted amount of warm - dense gas in these hlirgs suggests that at higher infrared luminosities , there may exist a strong deviation from the fit described by equation 4 which may be evident from the higher luminosity points in figure 2 .",
    "this implies that the infrared emission may grow non - linearly with increasing emission from warm - dense molecular gas .",
    "it may be that there is an interplay between an agn and star formation contribution to @xmath9 .",
    "the case has been mounting for an evolutionary sequence between hierarchical mergers and agn formation ( e.g. scoville , 2003 ) .",
    "it has recently become clear that most galaxies contain supermassive black holes ( kormendy & richstone , 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "there is also evidence that there is a connection between black hole growth and central ism physics in the remnants of galaxy mergers .",
    "recent sph simulations have shown that agn feedback in galaxy merger remnants can rapidly quench star formation after the initial merger - induced starburst ( springel , di matteo & hernquist 2004a , b ) .",
    "starbursts may be the dominant source of ir luminosity in less ir - luminous galaxies , while the agn contribution becomes more important in higher luminosity objects .",
    "quenching of star formation owing to agn feedback may be responsible for a steepening of the slope in the @xmath9 versus @xmath71 plot for the galaxies with log(@xmath72 @xmath26 12.3 l@xmath23 .",
    "indeed , some 35%-50% of ulirgs with @xmath9 @xmath73 10@xmath74 show agn activity from optical and nir spectra ( tran et al .",
    "2001 ; veilleux , kim & sanders , 2002 ) .",
    "this luminosity is approximately where our sample of lirgs and ulirgs ends , and a location for a possible deviation from the fit in figure 2 .",
    "additionally , farrah et al . (",
    "2002 ) discuss coeval starburst and agn activity in a sample of scuba hlirg sources .",
    "more co ( j=3 - 2 ) observations of ulirgs with @xmath75l@xmath23 are needed to test these hypotheses .",
    "theoretical models testing these concepts will be presented in an upcoming paper .",
    "one of the main arguments for the existence of a dust enshrouded agn as the main power source in luminous infrared galaxies is a sfe ( @xmath9/m@xmath76 ) larger than that seen in normal spiral galaxies .",
    "if the sole source of energy is a nuclear starburst , then , assuming a reasonable initial mass function , there should be an eddington - like limit on the star formation efficiency given by sfe @xmath5500 @xmath77/@xmath78 : objects with ratios significantly higher than this are likely to require an additional source of energy ( scoville , yun & bryant 1997 ; scoville , 2003 ) .",
    "the gas mass is obtained using a linear relation between the co luminosity and @xmath67 ( young & scoville , 1982 ; tinney et al . , 1990 ; sss91 ) .",
    "@xmath79 where @xmath51 is in k km s@xmath15 .",
    "this relation is derived assuming a co - h@xmath12 conversion factor of 3 x 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ( k km s@xmath15)@xmath15 , and was derived for galactic gmcs ( scoville & sanders 1987 ) .",
    "however , evidence exists that implies this conversion factor may not hold for external galaxies ( maloney 1989 ) . through a large velocity gradient ( lvg )",
    "analysis , yao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested that for lirgs / ulirgs , the co - h@xmath12 conversion factor lies between 1.3 x 10@xmath80 and 6.7 x 10@xmath80 @xmath14 ( k km s@xmath15)@xmath15 , or a factor of 0.04 to 0.22 times the conventional conversion factor .",
    "nevertheless , we adopt the galactic value in order to facilitate comparisons with published analyses of co ( j=1 - 0 ) observations .",
    "while the ratio of infrared luminosity to total gas mass may be a strong indicator as to the source of infrared luminosity , it is the _ dense _ gas mass that is expected to more directly trace star formation .",
    "thus , a prudent test is to examine the ratio of @xmath62 to @xmath81 .",
    "gao & solomon ( 2004a , b ) , found that this ratio remains between @xmath520 and @xmath5200 , independent of total ir luminosity for normal spirals , lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "they additionally reported that the average @xmath9 to @xmath82 in their sample was @xmath590l@xmath23/@xmath78 , comparable to molecular cloud cores ( mooney & solomon 1988 ) .",
    "these ratios were found through analysis of hcn ( j=1 - 0 ) .",
    "we present the ratio @xmath9/@xmath83 for our sample of lirgs in table 2 . as is evident",
    ", none of the objects have a ratio @xmath9/@xmath84500@xmath77/@xmath78 .",
    "there are a few important caveats to note .",
    "this number could be significantly skewed if our mass estimates are off . certainly ( following the derivation presented in appendix a of sss91 ) if the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor is , as derived by yao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , an order of magnitude lower than the conventional values , the @xmath9/m@xmath85 values would increase accordingly . using the co - h@xmath12 conversion factors calculated by yao et al .",
    ", we find 2 - 3 of our objects have ratios higher than 500 , indicating the possibility of an agn component to the observed far infrared luminosity .",
    "it should also be noted that the ratios presented here are of star formation rate per unit _ warm , dense _ gas mass - this hints at the possibility that the actual _ star forming _ gas available is not enough to produce the infrared luminosities seen in some objects .",
    "additionally , it is not clear that the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor is the same in all galaxies .",
    "better constraints on variations in the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor are necessary in order to use this method to make a robust statement concerning the source of ir luminosity .",
    "we have presented single - dish co ( j=3 - 2 ) observations of a sample of starbursts , lirgs and ulirgs in order to study properties of the warm - dense , star forming gas .",
    "we detected emission in 15 out of 17 galaxies within our noise limits .",
    "we have found a nearly - linear relationship between the infrared luminosity and amount of warm - dense gas , confirming the recent results by gao & solomon for galaxies with log(@xmath9)@xmath5012.3 .",
    "depending on the value of the adopted co - h@xmath12 conversion factor , our analysis suggests that star formation alone may not be sufficient to generate the ir emission observed in the more luminous galaxies .",

    "<S> the role of star formation in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath010@xmath1 ; ulirgs @xmath210@xmath3 ) is a hotly debated issue : while it is clear that starbursts play a large role in powering the ir luminosity in these galaxies , the relative importance of possible enshrouded agns is unknown . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to better understand the role of star forming gas in contributing to the infrared luminosity in ir - bright galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the j=3 level of @xmath4co lies 33k above ground and has a critical density of @xmath51.5@xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4co(j=3 - 2 ) line serves as an effective tracer for warm - dense molecular gas heated by active star formation . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on @xmath4co ( j=3 - 2 ) observations of 17 starburst spirals , lirgs and ulirgs which we obtained with the heinrich hertz submillimeter telescope on mt . </S>",

    "<S> our main results are the following : 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a nearly linear relation between the infrared luminosity and warm - dense molecular gas such that the infrared luminosity increases as the warm - dense molecular gas to the power 0.92 ; we interpret this to be roughly consistent with the recent results of gao & solomon ( 2004a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath9/@xmath10 ratios ranging from @xmath510 to @xmath5128 l@xmath11/m@xmath11 using a standard co - h@xmath12 conversion factor of 3 @xmath6 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ( k km s@xmath15)@xmath15 . if this conversion factor is @xmath5an order of magnitude less , as suggested in a recent statistical survey ( yao et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2003 ) , then 2 - 3 of our objects may have significant contributions to the @xmath9 by dust - enshrouded agns . </S>"
