    "in this paper we summarize an analysis@xcite of a peculiar feature visible in the observed power spectrum near multipoles @xmath8 .",
    "this is an interesting region in the cmb power spectrum because it corresponds to angular scales that are not yet in causal contact , so that the observed power spectrum is close to the true primordial power spectrum .",
    "the _ planck_@xcite observed power spectrum in this region is shown in figure [ fig:1 ] from ref .",
    "[ ] . although the error bars are large , there is a noticeable systematic deviation in the range @xmath8 below the best fit based upon the standard @xmath9cdm cosmology with a power - law primordial power spectrum .",
    "there is also a well - known suppression of the quadrupole moment in the cmb .",
    "these same features are visible in the cmb power spectrum from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ ) @xcite , and hence , are likely a true feature in the cmb power spectrum , although it should be noted that in the planck cosmological parameters paper,@xcite the deviation from a simple power law in the range @xmath8 was deduced to be of weak statistical significance due to the large cosmic variance at low @xmath10 .",
    "points with error bars are from the _ planck _ data release @xcite .",
    "the dashed line shows the best standard @xmath9cdm fit to the _ planck _ cmb power spectrum based upon a power - law primordial power spectrum .",
    "the solid line shows the best fit for a model with resonant particle creation during inflation.,width=288 ]    a number of mechanisms have been proposed ( see summary in ref .  [ ] ) to deal with the suppression of the power spectrum on large scales and low multipoles .",
    "most of these works , however , were concerned with the suppression of the lowest moments via changes in the inflation generating potential . in the present work@xcite",
    ", however , we are concerned specifically with suppression of the power spectrum in the range @xmath8 due to the possibility that new trans - planckian physics occurs near the end of the inflation epoch corresponding to the resonant creation @xcite of planck - scale particles that couple to the inflaton field .",
    "our best fit is shown by the solid line in figure [ fig:1 ] which we describe in detail in the following sections .",
    "this interpretation has the intriguing aspect that , if correct , an opportunity emerges to use the cmb to probe properties of new particle species that existed at and above the planck scale ( @xmath11 gev ) . that is the goal of the present work . indeed",
    ", string theory compactification schemes generically postulate the existence of massive particles at or above the planck scale from the kaluza - klein states , winding modes , string excitations , etc . moreover",
    ", the coupling of the inflaton to other particle species near the end of inflation is not only natural , but probably required .",
    "this is because the energy density in the inflaton must be converted to entropy in light or heavy particle species at the end of inflation as a means to reheat the universe .",
    "hence , the existence of planck - scale mass particles that couple to the inflaton near the end of inflation is a scenario that is both natural and even required .",
    "moreover , this provides a possible opportunity to uncover new physics in the trans - planckian regime .",
    "the details of the resonant particle creation paradigm during inflation have been explained in refs .  .",
    "indeed , the idea was originally introduced @xcite as a means for reheating after inflation . since @xcite subsequent work @xcite has elaborated on the basic scheme into a model with coupling between two scalar fields .    in this minimal extension from the basic picture ,",
    "the inflaton @xmath12 is postulated to couple to particles whose mass is of order the inflaton field value .",
    "these particles are then resonantly produced as the field obtains a critical value during inflation .",
    "if even a small fraction of the inflaton field is affected in this way , it can produce an observable feature in the primordial power spectrum .",
    "in particular , there can be either an excess in the power spectrum as noted in @xcite , or a dip in the power spectrum as described in this paper .",
    "such a dip offers important new clues to the trans - planckian physics of the early universe .    in the simplest slow roll approximation @xcite , the generation of density perturbations of amplitude , @xmath13 ,",
    "when crossing the hubble radius is just , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the expansion rate , and @xmath16 is the rate of change of the inflaton field when the comoving wave number @xmath17 crosses the hubble radius during inflation .    for the application here,@xcite we adopt a positive yukawa coupling of strength @xmath18 between an inflaton field @xmath12 and a field @xmath19 of @xmath7 degenerate fermion species.the total lagrangian density including the inflaton scalar field @xmath12 , the dirac fermion field , and the yukawa coupling term is simply , @xmath20 for this lagrangian , it is obvious that the fermions have an effective mass of @xmath21 this vanishes for a critical value of the inflaton field , @xmath22 .",
    "resonant fermion production will then occur@xcite in a narrow range of the inflaton field amplitude around @xmath23 .",
    "the cosmic scale factor is labeled @xmath24 at the time @xmath25 at which resonant particle production occurs . considering a small interval around this epoch",
    ", one can treat @xmath26 as approximately constant ( slow roll inflation ) .",
    "the number density @xmath27 of particles can be taken as zero before @xmath25 and afterwards as @xmath28^{3}$ ] .",
    "the fermion vacuum expectation value can then be written , @xmath29 } ~~.\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is a step function",
    ".    then , one obtains@xcite the perturbation in the primordial power spectrum as it exits the horizon : @xmath31_{n \\lambda = 0}}{1 + \\theta ( a - a _ * ) ( n \\lambda n_*/\\vert \\dot \\phi_*\\vert h _ * ) ( a_*/a)^3 \\ln{(a / a _ * ) } } ~~. \\label{deltahnew}\\ ] ] it is clear that the power in the fluctuation of the inflaton field will diminish as the particles are resonantly created when the universe grows to some critical scale factor @xmath24 .    using @xmath32 , then the perturbation spectrum eq .",
    "( [ deltahnew ] ) can be reduced @xcite to a simple two - parameter function .",
    "@xmath33_{n \\lambda = 0}}{1 + \\theta ( k - k_*)a ( k_*/k)^3 \\ln{(k / k _ * ) } } ~~. \\label{perturb}\\ ] ] where the amplitude @xmath34 and characteristic wave number @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) can be fit to the observed power spectrum from the relation : @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the comoving distance to the last scattering surface , taken here to be 14 gpc .",
    "the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 determined from from the cmb power spectrum relate to the inflaton coupling @xmath18 and fermion mass @xmath39 , for a given inflation model via eqs .",
    "( [ deltahnew ] ) and ( [ perturb ] ) .",
    "@xmath40    the connection between resonant particle creation and the cmb temperature fluctuations is straightforward .",
    "we have made a multi - dimensional markov chain monte - carlo analysis @xcite of the cmb using the _ planck _",
    "data @xcite and the _ cosmomc _ code @xcite . for simplicity and speed in the present study we only marginalized over parameters which do not alter the matter or cmb transfer functions",
    "hence , we only varied @xmath34 and @xmath35 , along with the six parameters , @xmath41 . here , @xmath42 is the baryon content , @xmath43 is the cold dark matter content , @xmath44 is the acoustic peak angular scale , @xmath45 is the optical depth , @xmath46 is the power - law spectral index , and @xmath47 is the normalization . adding this perturbation to the primordial power spectrum improves the total @xmath48 for the fit from 9803 to 9798 .",
    "one expects that the effect of interest here would only make a small change ( @xmath49 ) in the overall fit because it only affects a limited range of @xmath50 values with large error bars .",
    "nevertheless , from the likelihood contours we can deduce a mean value of @xmath51 with a maximum likelihood value of @xmath52 , and a mean value of @xmath53",
    "the coefficient @xmath34 can be related@xcite directly to the coupling constant @xmath18 this gives @xmath54 hence , for the maximum likelihood value of @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 so , @xmath57 requires @xmath58 as expected .",
    "the fermion particle mass @xmath39 can then be deduced from @xmath59 . from eq .",
    "( [ nconst ] ) then we have @xmath60 . for this purpose , we adopt a general monomial potential for which : @xmath61    for @xmath53 , and @xmath62 mpc@xmath63 we have @xmath64 .",
    "typically one expects @xmath65 .",
    "we note , however , that one can have the number of e - folds as low as @xmath66 in the case of thermal inflation @xcite . for standard inflation a monomial potential with @xmath67 would have @xmath68 . however , the limits on the tensor to scalar ration from the _ planck _ analysis @xcite rule out @xmath67 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "monomial potentials are more consistent with @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , or even @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "hence , we have roughly the constraint , @xmath73 so , one can deduce@xcite a family of possible properties of the resonantly produced particle ( i.e. its mass and coupling strength ) in terms of a single parameter , the degeneracy @xmath7 .",
    "we have analyzed the @xmath8 dip in the _ planck _ cmb power spectrum in the context of a model for the creation of @xmath7 nearly degenerate trans - planckian massive fermions during inflation .",
    "the best fit to the cmb power spectrum implies an optimum feature at @xmath74mpc@xmath3 and @xmath75 . for monomial inflation potentials consistent with the _ planck _ tensor - to - scalar ratio",
    ", this feature would correspond to the resonant creation of nearly degenerate particles with @xmath76 @xmath77 and a yukawa coupling constant @xmath18 between the fermion species and the inflaton field of @xmath78 for @xmath7 degenerate fermion species .",
    "we conclude that if the present analysis is correct , this may be one of the first hints at observational evidence of new particle physics at the planck scale .",
    "indeed , one expects a plethora of particles at the planck scale , particularly in the context of string theory .",
    "perhaps , the presently observed cmb power spectrum contains the first suggestion that a subset of such particles may have coupled to the inflaton field leaving a relic signature of their existence in the cmb primordial power spectrum .",
