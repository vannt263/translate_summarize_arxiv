    "the @xmath5 model must be generalized to the @xmath22 symmetry group of naive fermions , which should be broken to @xmath62 by the nnn coupling .",
    "going beyond the static baryon picture , we can disorder the baryon background by a replica method ; eventually dynamical baryons should be included with the third - order kinetic term .",
    "once the theory becomes realistic enough , we can compare the results at each step to the weak - coupling predictions of color superconductivity with various values of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a limitation inherent in the strong - coupling theory . as we saw in the mean - field analysis above , one",
    "is easily misled into filing the lattice with baryons to saturation .",

    "it is possible that color superconductivity will not show up at any density short of saturation . in that case",
    "we will have to content ourselves with a new effective theory for baryonic matter , short of the transition to quark matter .",
