    "optically trapped neutral atoms are being actively developed for quantum simulation and quantum computing applications@xcite and there has been substantial recent progress in improving the fidelity of one- and two - qubit gate operations@xcite .",

    "collective encoding provides a method for establishing a multi - qubit register in the collective states of a single atomic ensemble@xcite .",
    "one of the challenges in implementation of collective encoding is measuring the state of a single qubit without disturbing the rest of the register .",

    "this has the drawback of suffering from less than unity quantum efficiency of practical ion detectors , plus the problem of atom loss .",
    "after each measurement of a bit value of @xmath0 an atom is lost and has to be replaced from the collective reservoir state . the number of measurements which can be made before the reservoir is depleted is thus limited by the number of atoms in the ensemble .",
    "an alternative is to perform a rydberg gate between the register to be measured and an auxiliary register ( or single qubit ) in a neighboring trap .",
    "the state of the auxiliary bit can then be measured without atom loss .",
    "this has the drawback of requiring a longer range gate to be performed . for qubits encoded in a single atom",
    ", optical trap arrays can be used to define a multi - qubit register@xcite . also in this case measurement of the state of a single qubit without disturbance of proximal qubit locations",
    "is challenging due to the isotropic distribution of light scattered during a measurement .",
    "state measurements may also be based on cross entanglement of two different atomic elements located in the same trap , or nearby traps . by creating entanglement between qubits encoded in different types of atoms the quantum state of a qubit encoded in atom @xmath1",
    "can be measured via light scattering from the qubit encoded in atom @xmath2 .",
    "this is analogous to the mixed species quantum logic spectroscopy previously demonstrated with trapped ions@xcite .",
    "for example rb atoms have d1 and d2 resonance lines at 795 and 780 nm while cs atoms have d1 and d2 lines at 894 and 852 nm .",
    "the large separation implies that measurements , as well as optical pumping and state preparation , can be performed independently on nearby atoms .",

    "the rb - rb or cs - cs frster resonances given in tables [ tab.rbforster],[tab.csforster ] can also be anisotropic depending on which channels dominate .",
    "one of the outstanding challenges of neutral atom approaches to quantum computing is the requirement of qubit state measurements without loss , and with low crosstalk to proximal qubits .",
    "such a capability is essential for implementation of quantum error correction .",
    "the most widely used approach to qubit measurements with neutral alkali atoms relies on imaging of fluorescence photons scattered from a cycling transition between one of the qubit states and the strong d2 resonance line@xcite . due to a nonzero rate for spontaneous raman transitions from the upper hyperfine manifold",
    "there is a limit to how many photons can be scattered , and imaged , without changing the quantum state .",
    "this problem is typically solved by preceding a measurement with resonant  blow away \" light that removes atoms in one of the hyperfine states .",
    "the presence or absence of an atom is then measured with repumping light turned on , and a positive measurement result is used to infer that the atom was in the state that was not blown away .",
    "this method can indeed provide high fidelity state measurements but has several drawbacks .",
    "an atom is lost half the time on average , and must be reloaded and reinitialized for a computation to proceed .",
    "atom reloading involves mechanical transport , and thus tends to be slow compared to gate and measurement operations .",
    "in addition , error correction would require that a single site in a qubit array can be reloaded , without disturbing proximal qubits .",
    "while progress has been made towards this goal@xcite , much work remains to be done .",
    "lossless quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements that leave the atom in one of the qubit states , or at least in a known zeeman sublevel of the desired hyperfine state , can be performed provided that the measurement is completed while scattering so few photons that the probability of a raman transition is negligible .",
    "this was first done for atoms strongly coupled to a cavity@xcite , and was subsequently extended to atoms in free space@xcite .    despite these advances , achieving useful qnd state measurements in an array of neutral atom qubits remains an outstanding challenge due to the absorption of scattered photons by proximal atoms .",
    "since the resonant cross section for photon absorption is @xmath57 and qubits in recent lattice experiments are spaced by @xmath58@xcite the probability of a scattered photon being absorbed is @xmath59 if the qubit measurement is performed with a moderately high numerical aperture collection lens of @xmath60 and the optical and detector efficiencies are 50% the probability of photon detection is @xmath61 so that @xmath62 .",
    "this ratio implies that a state measurement based on detection of only a single photon would incur a @xmath63 probability of unwanted photon absorption at a neighboring qubit .",
    "this 4% error rate is too large to be efficiently handled by protocols for quantum error correction .",
    "one approach to solving the crosstalk problem is to protect nearby qubits in states that are dark to scattered resonant photons .",
    "this has been used effectively in experiments with trapped ions@xcite .",
    "such methods are in principle possible with neutral atoms , and an example using a single species is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.global ] for @xmath64rb .",
    "similar ideas could also be implemented with other species . while the protection protocol can in principle solve the crosstalk problem it has the drawback of requiring both local and global operations , and is thus both complicated to implement and likely to be relatively slow .",
    "nevertheless this protocol points to an alternative approach using interspecies coupling .",
    "[ fig.global ] protocol suppresses crosstalk by placing all but the atom of interest in a dark state with respect to the probe light .",
    "another way of suppressing crosstalk is to use one species for computational qubits and a second species for measurement qubits .",
    "selective mapping of computational to measurement qubits allows us to probe the measurement qubits while keeping the computational qubits in a dark state with respect to the probe light , which is only resonant with the second species .",
    "this idea is made explicit using a two - species array as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.array ] .",
    "our approach is analogous to the demonstrations of quantum logic spectroscopy@xcite and entanglement@xcite with two ion species , and builds on earlier ideas of mapping single atoms to ensembles for fast readout@xcite as well as the availability of asymmetric rydberg interactions for creating multiparticle entanglement@xcite .",
    "the interspecies protocol requires fewer operations than in fig .",
    "[ fig.global ] , and increases the useful photon rate per atom by a factor of four or more while eliminating crosstalk to other qubits .",
    "consider the qubit array shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.array ] .",
    "we assume this is a 2d array of 3d traps for cs atoms as described in @xcite , and used for recent experiments with single qubit@xcite and two - qubit@xcite quantum gates .",
    "we will modify the array slightly by changing the wavelength of the trap light from 780 nm to 820 nm .",
    "this is still blue - detuned for cs atoms which will be trapped at local minima of the optical intensity .",
    "the 820 nm light is red detuned for rb atoms which will be trapped at local maxima of the intensity , forming a checkerboard pattern of alternating cs and rb atoms .",
    "the lattice period separating atoms of the same species will be @xmath65 , and each cs atom is surrounded by four rb atoms at a distance of @xmath66 .",
    "the large wavelength separation between the rb resonance lines at 780 , 794 nm , the trap light at 820 nm , and the cs resonance lines at 852 , 894 nm allows for independent loading , cooling , control , and measurement of the two species .",

    "the rb - rb curve is the van der waals interaction summed over all four channels for @xmath68.,width=317 ]    let us now choose an interspecies frster resonance that gives strong rb - cs coupling and relatively weak rb - rb coupling .",

    "[ fig.ucross ] for the rb@xmath69-cs@xmath70 channel @xmath71 resonance from table [ tab.forster ] .",
    "each cs atom interacts with its nearest neighbor rb atoms with a strength of @xmath72 at @xmath73 and @xmath56 .",
    "we have assumed that the cs and rb atoms are excited to opposite @xmath74 values so we use eqs .",
    "( [ eq.uktheta],[eq.fminus ] ) to calculate the interaction strength .",
    "in contrast two rb atoms interact with a much smaller @xmath75 at @xmath76 .",
    "to measure the state of a cs atom qubit we prepare all rb atoms in the state @xmath77 by optical pumping and then perform the sequence @xmath78 provided the rabi frequency of the rb rydberg excitation @xmath79 is small compared to @xmath80 we create the entangled state @xmath81 the overbar in the rb kets denotes that this is a multiparticle state of four rb atoms .",
    "we then measure the hyperfine state of the rb atoms .",
    "a detector click projects the cs qubit into @xmath82 and no click projects into @xmath83 .",
    "this approach has several advantageous features . since each cs atom",
    "is strongly coupled to four nearest neighbors the photon rate can be four times greater than for measurement of a single atom . this reduces the difficulty of obtaining a hyperfine state measurement without suffering a raman transition .",
    "furthermore since the state of the cs qubit is measured using fluorescence light at 780 nm which is far detuned from the cs resonance lines , crosstalk to other cs qubits will be negligible .",
    "after a measurement the rb atoms can be rapidly repumped to the @xmath84 state in preparation for the next measurement .",
    "in addition to measurement of a single qubit the rb atoms could also naturally be used as ancilla qubits for syndrome extraction in quantum error correcting codes .",
    "we proceed to estimate the measurement fidelity with realistic experimental parameters .",
    "when the cs atom is in state @xmath83 the transfer of the rb atom between states will be affected by residual couplings @xmath85 to nearby atoms .",
    "this gives a transfer error for four atoms of @xcite @xmath86 the other dominant error is the imperfect blockade when the cs qubit is in state @xmath82 .",
    "the first @xmath87 pulse on the rb atom creates the state @xmath88 with @xmath89 if we set the rb rabi frequency such that @xmath90 then @xmath91 , and there is no state transfer , as desired .",
    "this result will be modified slightly by the presence of more than one rb atom , but an equivalent nulling condition will still exist . for the interaction strengths given above this condition",
    "is @xmath92 and the transfer error is @xmath93 .",
    "there is also a spontaneous emission error from the finite lifetime rydberg states .",
    "the cs qubit is on average rydberg excited for @xmath94 .",
    "the rb atom is on average rydberg excited for @xmath95 .",
    "the room temperature lifetimes are@xcite @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "taking @xmath98 we find @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the largest error is the rb state transfer at @xmath101 .",
    "this small error occurs on average half the time when the cs atom is in the @xmath83 state and could be reduced even further by using a 25% larger lattice spacing which would increase the @xmath102 ratio by a factor of two .",
    "it is also likely that adiabatic or composite pulse sequences can be designed to minimize the sensitivity to small variations in coupling strength@xcite .",
    "finally we note that the use of two different species , combined with optical tweezers at a wavelength that only perturbs one species at a time , provides a means to move quantum information about in a larger array .",
    "this idea was developed for the case of cs and li atoms in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the cited work",
    "the entanglement of cs and li atoms was envisioned to occur via short range molecular interactions .",
    "the interspecies rydberg interaction described here can in principle be extended to cs - li , or other combinations , with the advantage that interactions can be performed at long range .",
    "we have calculated the interspecies frster interaction between rb and cs atoms , as well as frster interactions for rb - rb and cs - cs where the participating atoms are excited to @xmath103 states with different principal quantum numbers .",
    "these interactions can be remarkably strong leading to van der waals interaction strengths of several mhz at @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "the strong interactions are of interest for long range coupling between atoms of the same species which has already been demonstrated in rb ensembles@xcite .",
    "we also propose to use the rb - cs interaction for lossless and crosstalk free qnd measurements .",
    "needless to say the fidelity of this approach to measurements relies on having high fidelity rydberg gates available .",
    "the current state of the art using the rydberg blockade interaction , without post selection , uses a cnot gate to create bell states with a fidelity of 0.73@xcite .",
    "this is much lower than the intrinsic fidelity of the rb - cs mapping protocol which we estimate in sec .",
    "[ sec.measurement ] to be @xmath106 with realistic experimental parameters .",
