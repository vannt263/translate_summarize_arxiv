    "a variety of strongly correlated charged systems shows a strong tendency to phase separation ( ps ) .",
    "@xcite often these system are two - dimensional ( 2d ) like the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg)@xcite or quasi two - dimensional like cuprates@xcite or some manganites.@xcite    advances in local probe techniques have revealed the mesoscopic nature of the phase coexistence . for example",
    "cuprates phase separate into superconducting like regions and poorly metallic regions on the scale of @xmath0 lattice constants.@xcite the regions have round like shapes indicating that surface energy has an important role .",
    "mesoscopic phase coexistence has also been reported in manganites.@xcite here the situation is quite complex .",
    "some systems have large insulating / metallic clusters with fractal like interfaces.@xcite in this case phase separation is dominated by disorder effects stabilizing one or the other of the two phases very close in energy . on the other hand scanning tunneling spectroscopy in thin films have revealed filamentary and drop like metallic / insulating regions in the scale of tenths to thousand of nanometers with smooth surfaces indicating strong surface energies . in both cases",
    "percolation of the metallic regions is closely correlated to abrupt changes in transport.@xcite finally neutron and x - ray scattering has revealed much smaller clusters , on the nanometer scale , in the bulk.@xcite    using a local probe in the 2deg , ilani and collaborators@xcite have shown that close to a puzzling metal - insulator transition@xcite the system becomes inhomogeneous at a mesoscopic scale .",
    "in addition the compressibility close to the transition , departs sharply from the predictions of an homogeneous electron gas.@xcite    mesoscopic inhomogeneities are generally expected in systems with a density driven first order phase - transition in the presence of long - range forces .",
    "this phenomenon is well known in a variety of systems@xcite ranging from neutron stars@xcite to spinodal decomposition hampered by elastic forces@xcite and it is also related to the problem of domain formation in ferromagnetic systems.@xcite    in charged systems the phase coexistence phenomenon is hampered by the long - range coulomb interaction ( lrc ) .",
    "indeed a macroscopic charge imbalance would imply an electrostatic energy cost which grows faster than the volume in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus it has been proposed that the system should break in domains in order to guarantee large - scale neutrality .",
    "@xcite in this way the charge is segregated over some characteristic distance but the average density at large distances is constant .    when the scale of the inhomogeneities is mesoscopic , one can perform a general analysis of fps independently of the specific short - range interaction favoring ps , in the same spirit of the maxwell construction ( mc).@xcite the specific short - range interaction , however , will account for different physical situations with different coexisting phases . due to this mesoscopic hypothesis the inhomogeneities can be treated as charged classical objects .",
    "their size and their relative distance are determined by the competition between the lrc interaction and the interface boundary energy .",
    "these effects determine the total `` mixing energy '' i.e. the excess of energy with respect to the unfrustrated ps . to characterize the degree of frustration",
    "one can define a dimensionless parameter @xmath1 given by the ratio of the characteristic mixing energy and the characteristic energy gain due to ps .",
    "in 3d systems it was shown that the lrc interaction favors uniform phases.@xcite indeed the coexistence region shrinks as @xmath1 increases and the uniform phases are stabilized at densities where the ordinary mc analysis would predict a ps state .",
    "in addition the size of the inhomogeneities in 3d systems has been shown to satisfy a `` maximum size theorem '' that says that inhomogeneities can not have all linear dimensions much larger than the screening length.@xcite    in this work we consider mesoscopic frustrated phase - separation for 2d electronic systems , that is electrons confined to a plane but subject to the 3d coulomb interaction in the presence of a rigid background .",
    "muratov , instead , has considered the case of a @xmath2-dimensional system immersed in the @xmath2-dimensional coulomb interaction.@xcite as a first approximation we neglect disorder effects and concentrate on the thermodynamic behavior in the clean limit .",
    "we analyze in detail the coexistence between a compressible phase ( named `` b '' ) and an incompressible phase ( named `` a '' ) corresponding to the physically relevant case of phase separation between a metal and an insulator .",
    "the results are easily generalizable to two compressible phases.@xcite a non - rigid background produces peculiar effects close to an energy level crossing of the electronic phases@xcite and will be discussed elsewhere in the present context.@xcite    we consider two different types of inhomogeneities : drops of one phase into the other phase and alternating stripes of each phase .",
    "we assume a uniform density inside each inhomogeneity .",
    "this uniform density approximation ( uda ) is relaxed in sec .",
    "[ seclda ] and tested in appendix [ seckbinf ] against a more involved local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "uda is shown to be quite accurate for the evolution of global thermodynamic quantities .    as in 3d systems ,",
    "the lrc interaction stabilizes the homogeneous metallic phase at densities where non frustrated systems would show ps .",
    "in contrast to the 3d case , in 2d the density driven transition to the inhomogeneous state changes order depending upon the different geometric arrangement . within our approximation , one has a second - order transition to a droplet state while the transition to the stripes geometry is always first - order like .",
    "moreover in 2d systems the size of the inhomogeneities is not limited by the screening length . as a result",
    "we find that 2d systems are more prone to mesoscopic fps than the 3d systems .",
    "as in the 3d case we assume a separation of length scales . in many models on a lattice it is found that short - range forces tend to phase separate the electrons between electron rich and electron poor regions.@xcite we assume that the short range forces lead to a double - well form for the energy of an hypothetical uniform phase as a function of density .",
    "we call @xmath3 and @xmath4 the energy densities close to each minimum , which define the bulk energy of the phases .",
    "long - range forces prevent large scale phase separation leading instead to domain formation . as a simplified assumption",
    "we assume uniform densities ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) for the inhomogeneities of each phase ( uda ) with sharp interfaces ( soft interfaces have been considered by muratov@xcite ) .",
    "this charge distribution is compensated by a rigid background of density @xmath7 .",
    "the uda will be relaxed in section [ seclda ] .",
    "the free energy per unit `` volume '' of the mixed - phase reads : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the volume fraction of the b - phase ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 represents the lrc interaction energy density and @xmath12 is the `` surface '' energy density .",
    "( here and below , in order to keep a common nomenclature with the 3d case , we call `` volume '' a quantity with units of length squared and `` surface '' a quantity with units of length ) . due",
    "to charge neutrality the global charge density of electrons has to compensate the charge density of the background @xmath13 .",
    "this leads to the following neutrality constraint : @xmath14    to proceed further we assume specific geometries for the inhomogeneities .",
    "we will consider the competition among the two following geometries : _ i _ ) drops ( disks ) of one phase surrounded by the other phase and _ ii _ ) a periodic structure of alternating stripes of the two coexisting phases .",
    "for the drops we divide the system in cells of radius @xmath15 enclosing one domain of the b - phase with radius @xmath16 .",
    "similarly for the stripes the cell has width @xmath17 and contains a b - phase stripe of width @xmath18 . the volume fraction is related to these characteristic lengths by : @xmath19 where for 2d systems @xmath20 for the stripe geometry and the drop geometry respectively . in the latter case the cells are slightly overlapping with : @xmath21 ( @xmath22 indicates the number of cells in the system while @xmath23 is the total volume ) . for the stripe geometry @xmath24 where @xmath25 indicates the length of the stripes .",
    "the total surface energy per unit volume can be parameterized by a quantity @xmath26 with dimensions of energy per unit surface ( actually length in 2d ) .",
    "it reads : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the surface of the domain interface inside one cell with @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the drops and the stripes respectively . for inhomogeneities of the b - phase hosted by the a - phase",
    ", @xmath31 can be written as : @xmath32    the operation : @xmath33 , @xmath34 was named `` phase exchange '' in ref .  .",
    "within the uda the energy should not change under this operation.@xcite for the stripe geometry case the surface energy does not depend on @xmath35 and eq .",
    "( [ dsurface ] ) already preserves the phase - exchange symmetry . on the contrary for the drop geometry",
    "eq .   is appropriate only for small @xmath35 .",
    "in fact for intermediate volume fractions the drops should deform and for @xmath36 the b - phase should represent the host in which drops of the a - phase are immersed .",
    "eq .  , instead , violates this phase exchange symmetry because it involves drops of b - phase in both cases .",
    "we can define a ",
    "symmetrized  interpolating form that is correct at the two extremes ( @xmath37 and @xmath36 ) : @xmath38^{\\frac{\\alpha-1}{\\alpha } } \\label{dsurfapprox}\\ ] ] this is enough for our proposal because we can anticipate that drops are stable only in a narrow region close to @xmath37 and @xmath36 ( _ c.f . _ fig .  [ ucomparison ] ) .",
    "the long - range coulomb interaction energy is computed in the appendix  [ secappe ] by dividing the systems in neutral wigner - seitz cells . for stripes",
    "the electrostatic energy is computed numerically .    the electrostatic energy contribution due to the interaction between different cells can be neglected for volume fractions close to @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in these limits , in fact , the inhomogeneities are far from each other and the interaction becomes irrelevant .",
    "we show below that this is indeed a reasonable approximation in the full range of volume fractions . as discussed in appendix  [ secappe ] , we expect this approximation to be even more accurate for the drop geometry .",
