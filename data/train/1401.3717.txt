    "large - scale networks of interacting dynamical systems with translational symmetry are ubiquitous in the physical world .",
    "a natural example is provided by crystalline solids , where the spatial periodicity in the arrangement of atoms results from their interaction and plays an important role in the thermodynamic and mechanical properties of solids ( such as heat capacity and speed of sound ) as reflected in the phonon theory @xcite .",
    "translation invariant interconnections are exploited in modern engineering applications such as communication networks , vehicle platooning and metamaterials @xcite .",
    "the latter are exemplified by split ring resonator arrays which are artificially fabricated media with a negative refraction index .",
    "the unusual electrodynamic properties of such materials are achieved , not only due to the common structure of individual building blocks , but also the translation invariance of their interconnection . moreover , the last feature is crucial for the nontrivial collective response of the whole system to time - varying electromagnetic fields .",
    "these ideas are taken from the classical macroscopic scale to the quantum level in quantum metamaterials @xcite which are organised as one , two or three - dimensional @xcite periodic arrays of coherently coupled quantum systems . the latter form a fully quantum composite system which does not involve measurements .",
    "active research into this kind of artificial materials is inspired by qualitatively new properties of light - matter interaction which unveil previously hidden resources .",
    "an example is provided by artificial crystals of atoms trapped at nodes of an optical lattice which can be controlled by external fields and used for entanglement generation @xcite or as a quantum memory @xcite .    in light of the emerging technology of quantum metamaterials ,",
    "the present paper is concerned with the modelling and analysis of the dynamics of translation invariant networks of interacting linear quantum stochastic systems which represent open quantum harmonic oscillators . in particular , we are concerned with physical realizability ( pr ) and mean square performance of this class of large - scale quantum systems from the viewpoint of quantum linear systems theory @xcite .    in the present setting ,",
    "the quantum systems form a one - dimensional chain or are associated with sites of a multidimensional lattice and are governed by a set of coupled linear quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) in the framework of the hudson - parthasarathy noncommutative version of the ito calculus @xcite .",
    "although these qsdes look similar to the classical ito sdes widely used in linear stochastic control theory @xcite , their coefficients must satisfy certain pr conditions @xcite .",
    "the pr constraints are closely related with the postulate of a unitary evolution @xcite for isolated quantum systems ( for example , those formed from a system of interest and its environment which may involve other quantum systems and external fields ) .",
    "such an evolution preserves canonical commutation relations ( ccrs ) between quantum variables and is specified by the `` energetics '' of the underlying system and its interaction with the surroundings .",
    "the dynamics of interconnected quantum stochastic systems are governed by qsdes whose drift and diffusion terms are expressed in terms of scattering , coupling and hamiltonian operators @xcite . for linear quantum stochastic systems ,",
    "the pr conditions reflect dynamic equivalence to an open quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite whose dynamic variables satisfy ccrs .",
    "its hamiltonian is quadratic and the coupling operator is linear with respect to the dynamic variables .",
    "the resulting pr conditions are organised as quadratic constraints on the state - space matrices of the qsdes @xcite .    using the previous results on pr of linear qsdes , we take advantage of the specific structure of coupled qsdes for translation invariant quantum networks with nearest neighbour interaction .",
    "this allows pr constraints to be established here in the form of matrix algebraic equations for the parameters of an individual building block of the network and its coupling to its neighbours and external fields .    adapting the performance criteria used in the coherent quantum linear quadratic gaussian ( cqlqg ) control / filtering problems @xcite",
    ", we also discuss mean square functionals with block toeplitz weighting matrices whose structure reflects the translation invariance of the quantum network . under a stability condition",
    ", we compute the steady - state value of such a functional per site for unboundedly increasing fragments of the network .",
    "this corresponds to the thermodynamic limit in equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the results of the paper can be used for the development of decentralised cqlqg controllers for large - scale quantum networks .",

    "section [ sec : chain ] describes a one - dimensional chain of interacting quantum systems .",
