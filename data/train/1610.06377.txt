    "<S> we analyze theoretically the finite - temperature polarization dynamic in displacive - type ferroelectrics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we consider the thermally - activated switching time of a single - domain ferroelectric polarization studied by means of the landau - khalatnikov equation , extended as to capture thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared with the switching time formula that follows from the analytical solution of pauli master equations . in a second step </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the phase diagram of a prototypical ferroelectric as described by the temperature - dependent landau - devonshire model including thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show the emergence of phase instability at reduced sizes which we attribute to thermal fluctuations in the order parameter in the respective phase . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , along with the temperature - dependent potential coefficients , thermal fluctuations should be taken into account to achieve a comprehensive description of the thermal behavior of reduced - size ferroelectrics . to endorse our conclusions , we simulated the electric - field activated switching time for a multi - domain system and compared the results to the predictions of well - established models such as the kolmogorov - avrami - ishibashi . </S>"
