    "two solids in mechanical contact tend to touch at only a miniscule fraction of their apparent contact area @xmath2 , because their surfaces are microscopically rough  @xcite .",
    "this imperfect contact has profound implications for transmission of charge , heat and forces through the interface .",
    "the effect of the interface can be expressed in terms of an interfacial stiffness or conductance that adds in series with the bulk response of two solids with ideal flat surfaces @xcite .",
    "improved theories of these interfacial contributions are important because they frequently dominate the total response of the system and are a strong function of the normal force @xmath3 ( or load ) pushing the solids together . in this paper",
    "we consider the scaling of stiffness with @xmath3 for nonadhesive self - affine rough surfaces .",
    "the results are more generally applicable since the shear and normal stiffness and electrical and heat conductance are all proportional to each other within linear - response continuum mechanics  @xcite .    in a pioneering experimental work , berthoud and",
    "baumberger found that the interfacial stiffness was proportional to @xmath3 for nonadhesive solids with very different elastic properties  @xcite .",
    "the proportionality can be expressed as @xmath4 where @xmath0 is the interfacial stiffness normalized by @xmath2 , and @xmath5 .",

    "the surfaces had self - affine fractal roughness that is common in experiments .",
    "berthoud and baumberger rationalized their observations within the contact mechanics theory of greenwood and williamson  @xcite , which , however , is based on hypotheses that later turned out to be unjustified  @xcite .",

    "persson theory finds that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the effective elastic modulus and @xmath21 is dimensionless . like @xmath6 , @xmath21 only depends on the spectral properties of the surface  @xcite .",
    "analytical expressions for @xmath6 and @xmath21 and computer simulations agree again to within @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "in a recent letter , pohrt and popov  @xcite challenged the established results on interfacial stiffness by proposing a sublinear @xmath22 power law deduced from numerical simulations of an indenter with a square punch geometry . specifically , they reported @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the hurst roughness exponent .",
    "this estimate was later corrected to @xmath25 and scaling arguments were presented for a third relation @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "_ argued that their results differed from previous ones because their surfaces were `` _ truly fractal _ ''  @xcite , i.e. , roughness lived on wavelengths all the way to the linear size @xmath27 of their punch .",
    "in particular they state : `` whenever the surfaces are truly fractal with no cut - off wavelength , a power law applies ''  @xcite .    in this paper , we unravel the origin of the discrepancy between the established results and the new findings .",
    "to do so , we analyze finite - size effects in numerical simulations .",
    "we derive analytical expressions , free of adjustable parameters , that capture finite - size effects and constitute a complete theory for the stiffness of rough contacts .",
    "for brevity , we present only the essence of the calculations in the main part of this work .",
    "details on the numerical procedure can be found in appendix  [ sec : num ] .",
    "the full derivation of prefactors for our scaling theory , can be found in appendix  [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "appendix  [ sec : exp ] contains unpublished experiments in support of persson s contact mechanics theory .",
    "we first summarize the arguments for how eq .",
    "( [ eq : stiffness ] ) arises from the self - affinity of interfaces  @xcite .",
    "the key idea is that when there are a large number of separated contacting patches , the distribution of contacts is self - similar . as the load increases , existing contact patches grow and new , small contacts are formed .",
    "this happens in such a way that the distributions of contact sizes and local pressures remain approximately constant over a wide range of loads  @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence is a linear relation between real contact area @xmath28 and @xmath1 , which has been confirmed in many simulations , including all numerical studies cited here .",
    "the spatial correlations between contacting areas and local stresses are also the same up to a prefactor that grows linearly with load because of a sum rule @xcite .",
    "since the system responds linearly , the elastic energy @xmath29 is given by an integral of an elastic greens function times the fourier transform of the stress - stress correlation function and must thus be proportional to load : @xmath30 since the elastic energy is equal to the work done by the external load ( assuming hard - wall interactions and no adhesion ) , it follows that @xmath31 .",
    "this last relation is identical to ( [ eq : oldeqno1 ] ) and thus also to ( [ eq : stiffness ] ) .",
    "when @xmath1 is so small that two _ finite _ surfaces start touching , the interface can not yet behave in a self - similar fashion .",
    "the reason is that contact occurs only near the highest asperity whose height determines the separation at first contact @xmath32 . as a consequence , the validity of the arguments leading to ( [ eq : elastenerg ] ) and thus to ( [ eq : stiffness ] )  or any theory valid in the thermodynamic limit",
    " can not hold at small @xmath1 . as already pointed out earlier ,",
    "finite - size effects then become important  @xcite . specifically , for a finite system @xmath1 vanishes for ( finite ) @xmath33 , while for an infinite system @xmath1 is always non - vanishing .",
    "thus , @xmath1 must initially decay faster with increasing @xmath34 in a finite system than in an infinite system where eq .",
    "( [ eq : stiffness ] ) holds . in the opposite case of large @xmath1 , a finite system approaches complete contact , @xmath35 , at finite pressure but infinite systems do not because they have infinitely deep valleys .",
    "one may conclude that contact formation of the highest peak and the lowest valley depend on the specific realization of a surface .",
    "however , for intermediate pressures , universal behavior may be found as long as the roughness has well - defined statistical properties .    to study finite - size effects",
    ", we performed large - scale numerical simulations of nonadhesive contact between a rigid self - affine surface and an isotropic elastic substrate with effective modulus @xmath20 and poisson number @xmath36 using well - established methods @xcite that are discussed in more detail in appendix  [ sec : num ] .",

    "figure  [ fig : test ] shows typical results for the contact stiffness versus pressure .",
    "note that all the quantities are made dimensionless by dividing by the modulus and rms roughness so that they can be mapped to any experimental system with the same surface statistics . in all cases ,",
    "there is a linear relation at intermediate loads and a more rapid rise of @xmath0 with @xmath1 as full contact is approached .",
    "both regimes are well - described by persson s contact mechanics theory ( red line ) , which requires only the surface roughness power spectrum and the effective modulus as input .",
    "we also find a transition to power law scaling at low loads .",
    "this transition is particularly sensitive to the magnitude of a few random fourier components at the smallest wavevectors as well as to their relative phases .",
    "the separation at first contact @xmath32 is also very sensitive to these fourier components and decreases with @xmath47 .",

    "the range of validity of the linear scaling regime extends rapidly to lower @xmath1 as @xmath47 increases .",
    "thus the more closely the thermodynamic limit is approached  or the more significant the statistical distribution of contacting peaks  the more accurate is eq .",

    "additionally , at extremely small loads where first asperities are touching the behavior should be hertzian with @xmath60 if @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , we find that reducing the ratio of @xmath62 gives an exponent that approaches the one expected from hertz contact mechanics .",

    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite do not show any appreciable region of linear scaling .",

    "@xcite , the flat punch results cross over to a rapid rise with no region of linear scaling .",
    "inspection of the results shows that this behavior is associated with strong artifacts from the boundary conditions at the edge of the punch .",
    "the analytic solution for the pressure under a flat punch has a singularity at the punch edges .",
    "the solution for a rough punch approaches this solution as the pressure increases . the pressure and stiffness are all dominated by regions near the edge which approach full contact long before the central regions .",
    "the strong influence of the edge makes the problem effectively one dimensional , which may explain the success of the dimensional reduction used in ref .",
    "@xcite to fit their results .",
    "in the intermediate load regime , fig .  [ fig : test ] indicates @xmath63 behavior with @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "thus , our small - pressure results for @xmath56 are consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we propose a new explanation for this power law by incorporating the estimation of finite - size effects into persson s contact mechanics theory .",
    "the goal is to find an expression for the elastic energy because it allows us to calculate the contact stiffness .",
    "we reexpress a small change of the elastic energy @xmath66 as @xmath67 . inserting @xmath68 and @xmath69 yields @xmath70",
    "our approach is motivated by the fact that the elastic energy is dominated by the longest wavelength modes @xcite . for a single contacting region around the highest peak ,",
    "the longest wavelength will scale with the radius @xmath71 of the smallest circle that encloses the contacts .",
    "we will first calculate the elastic energy @xmath72 for a single hertzian - like mesoscale asperity with radius of curvature @xmath73 and contact radius @xmath71 .",
    "then we show that including roughness on the mesoasperity at wavelengths smaller than @xmath71 gives the same power law scaling for the elastic energy @xmath74 . for brevity ,",
    "what follows presents only the general scaling arguments that explain the observed power law .",
