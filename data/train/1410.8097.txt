    "the goal of the present paper is to quantify the uncertainties on the knowledge of the nn system from the present available experimental pp and np scattering data and their uncertainties .",
    "we do this from a comprehensive partial wave analysis ( pwa ) containing the largest nn database to date wich permits a statistically self - consistent least squares fit . from the determination of several statistically equivalent interactions we deduce the residual systematic differences in many two body quantities of interest .",
    "the main result is the dominance of these systematic errors over the statistical ones determined from each interaction separately .",
    "the nn interaction , as a key building block of nuclear physics , has traditionally been inferred from pp and np scattering data .",
    "this task is hampered both by the fragmentary body of experiments as well as by the incomplete status of the models used to analyze them .",
    "these aspects have important consequences regarding the predictive power , accuracy and precision in theoretical nuclear physics .",
    "in particular , _ ab initio _ calculations of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions in terms of protons and neutrons as elementary constituents require the design of nucleon - nucleon potentials validated with the existing scattering information ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a lucid presentation ) . as it is well known the form and representation of potentials",
    "is not unique , and the historic evolution reflects this large diversity  ( see  @xcite and references therein for a pre - nineties review ) . even if a set of potentials are succesfully validated against the existing scattering data by an statistically acceptable @xmath3 fit value , the inferred predictions of unmeasured scattering quantities or other observable quantities such as nuclear bindings have two sources of uncertainties .",
    "besides the obvious ones stemming from the experimental data and whose statistical nature requires passing elementary statistical tests , one also has a dependence on the particular choice of potential used to make the fit .",
    "this residual non - statistical dependence is our definition of the systematic uncertainty . in",
    "what follows we will ellaborate on what we think are elementary aspects of error analysis  @xcite , as applied to the nn interaction since these basic principles can be easily implemented in large scale fits and calculations .",
    "the statistical uncertainties are easier to quantify , provided one can credibly establish that the discrepancies between theory and experiment are fluctuations whose probability distribution is either known _ a priori _ or confidently tested _ a posteriori_. for the conventional least squares @xmath3-fit procedure this corresponds to test the normality of fitting residuals obtained by building the differences from the optimized theory and the fitted experimental data . when this is the fortunate case , the fit is self - consistent as the _ a priori _ assumption is verified _ a posteriori _ by the actual fit , and statistical error propagation can routinely be undertaken .",
    "we stress this essential point as it has too often been ignored in the design of the so - called high - quality potentials in the past .",
    "systematic uncertainties are notoriously more difficult to pin down in general .",
    "in fact , there are many ways to quantify the systematic uncertainties and none of them can be complete within the present context for two main reasons .",
    "on the one hand there are many imaginable forms of potentials which could fit the existing finite amount of data with equal statistically meaningfull quality , and thus in general only lower bounds on the systematics can be estimated .",
    "on the other hand there exist many derived quantities such as scattering amplitudes , phase - shifts or nuclear binding energies which will reflect the effect of the systematic error differently on a quantitative level .",
    "this has been the traditional approach to systematic uncertainties in the past by trying out different high quality potentials in nuclear structure ab initio calculations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our work can be framed within the currently growing efforts to realistically pin down the existing uncertainties stemming from different sources in theoretical nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a special issue dedicated to this topic appeared recently in jour .",
    "g  @xcite  . in this paper",
    "we will restrict the analysis to the nn scattering amplitude and try to set lower bounds both on statistical as well as systematic uncertainties in terms of a finite number of potentials suitable for nuclear structure calculations .",
    "the set of model potentials used below is a convenient tool with the purpose of quantifying the uncertainties .",
    "this is a necessary but already insightful step before extending these uncertainties to _ ab initio _ nuclear structure calculations . since it is naturally assumed that for light nuclei nuclear binding is mainly sensitive to low energy nn scattering , we also extensively study the long wavelength limit because also potential model details are expected to become least relevant .",
    "we find that _ even _ in the low energy limit the systematic uncertainties dominate over those statistical uncertainties arising directly from the same experimental data .",
    "our analysis is based on a comparison of 6 statistically acceptable but different model potentials , i.e. , with @xmath4 developed by our group fitting the _ same _ self consistent granada database comprising a total of 6713 nn scattering  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is complementary to  @xcite and further dedicated studies along these lines  @xcite .      in order to understand our most unexpected result and to provide a proper perspective",
    ", we provide at this point a sucint review with the historic benchmarks as guidelines highlighting those aspects specifically dealing with our work .",
    "we recommend the comprehensive presentation covering up to 1992 for a wider scope  @xcite .",
    "the low energy structure of the nn interaction has received a recurrent attention since the late 40 s when bethe proposed the effective range expansion  @xcite ( ere ) . the shape and model independence of the amplitude captured with a few number of parameters the essence of the nn force ; an unique and particularly appealing universal pattern in the long wavelength limit of short range interactions . because this is a low energy expansion of the full scattering amplitude in powers of small momentum ,",
    "higher partial waves are not needed in principle , and one may imagine an ideal situation with a direct determination from very low energy scattering only . however , these very low energy data are scarce and an extrapolation to zero energy must always be made .",
    "much higher accuracy can be obtained by intertwining lower and higher energies via a large scale partial wave analysis ( pwa ) so that many more data contribute to the threshold parameters precision when the resulting scattering amplidues are evaluated at zero energy .",
    "while this procedure largely increases the statistics , this interrelation can not be achieved for free . as we discuss next",
    "some unavoidable model dependence is introduced , thus generating a source of systematic errors beyond the genuine statistical errors of the pwa .",
    "indeed , the nn scattering amplitude contains 10 functions of energy and angle and a complete set of experiments is needed to determine it without model dependence  @xcite . while the usefulness of polarization was soon realized  @xcite as well as the strong unitarity constraints on the uniqueness of the solution  @xcite ( see  @xcite for an analytical solution ) , complete sets of observables are scarce at the energies relevant to nuclear structure applications , corresponding to energies below or about pion production threshold ( see also @xcite ) . following the standard custom , we will take the maximal lab energy in our potential analysis to be @xmath1 , which has been the canonical choice for nn potential fits . as a consequence a pwa in conjunction with the standard least squares",
    "@xmath3-method pioneered by stapp and ypsilantis  @xcite is usually pursued to fit the set of measured scattering observables at given _",
    "discrete _ energy and angle values . soon thereafter , the nowadays widely accepted probabilistic interpretation of the @xmath3-fit in terms of the p - value was introduced as a measure of the confidence level  @xcite ( see particularly the figure in @xcite where the p - value is explicitly displayed ) .",
    "the method was popularized during the 60 s by macgregor and arndt with additional implementations , such as a rejection criterium for the growing number of incompatible parameters  @xcite .",
    "this is nothing but the long established chauvenet s @xmath5 criterion ( see @xcite ) to statistically reject data sets with an improbably high or improbably low @xmath3 value .",
    "this incomplete and discretized experimental information requires using smooth interpolating energy dependent functions for the scattering matrix in all partial waves for nearby but unmeasured kinematic regions .",
    "alternatively , quantum mechanical potentials with proper long distance behavior generate analytical energy dependence with the adequate cut - structure in the complex energy plane ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "we follow here the potential approach since it has the obvious advantage over a mere partial wave analysis of being of direct use in nuclear structure calculations , and hence it allows to direct transporting uncertainties from the data to energy bindings .",
    "the potential approach is subjected to inverse scattering off - shell ambiguities  @xcite as the potential contains generically 10 matrix functions  @xcite , manifesting themselves as a systematic uncertainty in the observables at the interpolated , not directly measured , energy values .",
    "if one fixes a maximum energy for the pwa the ambiguities reflect the finite spatial resolution corresponding to the shortest de broglie wavelength below which the interaction is not determined by the data .",
    "thus , we might expect that in the long wavelength limit systematic uncertainties will be greatly reduced .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : dat - mod ] we describe the main ideas behind our analysis , reviewing our previous works as well as a summary of the 6 model potentials used in our analysis .",
    "we remind the effective range expansion for the deuteron channel in section  [ sec : low - exp ] . the convenient and accurate tool which we will be using to evaluate low energy parameters in the discrete version of the coupled channel variable s - matrix approach",
    "is presented in section  [ sec : discrete - s ] .",
    "this framework proves extremely convenient to discuss the pertinent sampling of the interaction , and the difference between fine and coarse graining is addressed in section  [ sec : fine - coarse ] .",
    "there , peculiar numerical aspects of these calculations are also analyzed .",
    "our main numerical results concerning the comparison between statistical vs systematic uncertainties are presented in section  [ sec : stat - sys ] in terms of phase - shifts , scattering amplitudes and potentials . in section  [ sec : port ]",
    "we ponder on the portability of phase shift analyses based on our own experience with nuclear potentials .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our main results and conclusions . in the appendices we provide some details concerning three new potentials introduced in the present work .",

    "this value is probably so large because the full database has been used before the data selection .",
    "more recent chiral motivated interactions usually fit data up to lower energies @xcite and are therefore in this picture . however , some of their merits have been discussed on previous publications @xcite .",
    "after this first statistically satisfactory nijmegen study , several potentials describing data up to a laboratory frame energy of @xmath14 mev were developed with similar @xmath34 values .",
    "all of them include the distinguished charge dependent ( cd ) one pion exchange ( ope ) , magnetic moments , vacuum polarization and relativistic effects as the long range part of the interaction , and around @xmath35 parameters for the short and intermediate range regions @xcite . these ope - tailed potentials with",
    "@xmath36 have played a major role in nuclear physics .",
    "it should be noted , however , that an error analysis of these potentials based on the finite experimental scattering accuracy has been overlooked , and as a consequence any _ ab initio _ nuclear structure calculations using them are unable to quantify the impact of nn scattering uncertainties in nuclear bindings .      in a recent paper",
    "we have updated the nijmegen pwa by including data up to 2013 , improving after @xcite the @xmath5 criterion to select a self - consistent database with @xmath37 np and pp scattering data and providing statistical error bars to the fitting parameters  @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent granada database is available for download  @xcite .",
    "the delta - shell ( ds ) representation of the potential allowed the propagation of statistical uncertainties from the scattering data into potential parameters , phase shifts , scattering amplitudes and deuteron properties .",
    "this was possible due to the simplification in calculating the hessian matrix .",
    "subsequently , we have extended the ds potential including chiral two pion exchange ( @xmath11tpe ) in the intermediate and long range regions  @xcite .",
    "we also introduced a local , smooth potential parameterized as a sum of gaussians ( sog ) with ope  @xcite . in appendices",
    "[ app : gaustpe ] and [ app : deltabo ] we introduce three new model interactions .",
    "one of them is a sog model with @xmath11tpe .",
    "the other two contain @xmath12 resonances as dynamical degrees of freedom through the born - oppenheimer approximation ( @xmath12bo ) , and are modeled either by ds or sog at short distances .",
    "note that only the sog model potentials are smooth and can be plotted .",
    "the statistical features of the 6 model interactions are displayed in table  [ tab : gr - pots ] where we provide the number of parameters for np and pp scattering , , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , as well as the total @xmath3 values in each separate case .",
    "the p - value corresponds to the actual @xmath38 value .",
    "as we have stressed in our previous works  @xcite one can globally sligthtly enlarge the experimental uncertainties by the so - called birge factor provided the residuals pass a gaussianity test .",
    "after this re - scaling the p - value becomes 0.68 for a @xmath15 confidence level and hence all potentials become statistically equivalent . as can be seen",
    "all of our potentials incorporate the appropriate propagation of statistical uncertainties .",
    "this has been possible because the residuals of our fits are normally distributed .",
    "this requirement of the @xmath3 method , has been verified _ a posteriori _ with a high confidence level .",
    "we stress that a lack of normality in the residuals would strongly suggest the presence of systematic uncertainties in the analysis , disallowing the propagation of statistical errors .",
    "the same database has also been recently used to fit a chiral tpe potential that directly includes delta excitation  @xcite . in the cases where normality",
    "is unequivocally fulfilled we have propagated statistical uncertainties by applying the bootstrap monte carlo method _ directly _ to the experimental data  @xcite , which simulates an ensemble of conceivable experiments based on the experimental uncertainties estimates .",
    "a similar method has successfully been applied to estimate the statistical uncertainty in the triton binding energy solving the faddeev equations  @xcite and the alpha - particle using shell model techniques  @xcite . a similar propagation to the @xmath39-particle binding energy solving the faddeev - yakubovsky equations  @xcite has been advanced recently .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] the @xmath40 confidence level corresponds to the interval @xmath41 and the corresponding p - value is @xmath42 .",
    "the p - value is the probability of being wrong when denying the normal nature of the fluctuations .",
    "both the said fit  @xcite and the granada - all fit provide a similar value which is outside a @xmath17 band , which implies a p - value smaller than @xmath43 . as we discussed in detail in our previous work",
    ", one can tolerate a value of @xmath44 outside the interval @xmath45 as long as we can identify a scaled gaussian distribution by using normality tests .",
    "@xcite . as it was pointed out  @xcite",
    "this is _ not _ the case for the granada - all database , and thus the selection of data seems mandatory  . from the figure it is also clear that the self - consistent granada-2013 database is so far the largest database consistent with a statistically successfull pwa of np and pp scattering below lab energy @xmath1 .",
    "as already mentioned , in the absence of complete sets of measurements one must resort to specific potentials to carry out the pwa .",
    "since the form of the potential is chosen and fixed _ a priori _ , the analysis of nn scattering data is subjected to inverse scattering ambiguities which are amplified as the energy increases .",
    "therefore one expects lowest energy information to be more universal and thus we use the effective range expansion ( ere )  @xcite as the suitable tool .",
    "although for s - waves the calculation of the low energy threshold parameters is straightforward and even customary for nn potentials , their calculation for higher and coupled channel partial waves is a computational challenge which has seldomly been addressed . to start with ,",
    "there are not even ready - to - use formulas in the coupled channel case , and a low energy expansion of the wave function to high orders is needed .",
    "in addition , partial waves with high angular momentum become numerically unstable as the main contribution comes from very long distances requiring demanding numerical computations .",
    "this is the reason why these low energy parameters have been very rarely computed or , when they have been , a very limiting accuracy has been displayed . using calogero s variable phase approach to the full s - matrix  @xcite the low energy parameters have only been calculated for the reid93 and nijmii potentials up to @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "here we improve on the accuracy of that work and determine for the first time the statistical uncertainties of the low energy threshold parameters . the method to compute these low energy parameters in the general case",
    "is based on the discrete variable - s - matrix method which we explain in more detail in appendix  [ sec : discrete - s ] .",
    "in essence in this method one replaces the original potential by a sum of delta - shells , which in the equidistant case corresponds to @xmath47 and computes the accumulated phase of s - matrix es the number of grid points is switched on .",

    "several high - quality interactions stemming from the 1993 nijmegen pwa such as the nijmii , reid93 , av18 potentials are smooth functions in configuration space . for the discrete s - matrix method ( see appendix  [ sec : discrete - s ] for details ) this means that the values @xmath103 are _ given _ for @xmath104 , and thus a fine graining @xmath105 is needed .",
    "we test the numerical accuracy and precision of the approach by using a finite grid representation and determine the low energy parameters of these potentials .",
    "in particular , we take @xmath106 and @xmath107 corresponding to @xmath108 grid points respectively and convergence is established for both @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    for illustration",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2v3v4 ] eye - ball convergence for @xmath111 ( eigen ) in the @xmath49 channel , which is achieved with an integration upper limit of @xmath112 .",
    "sufficiently high numerical convergence is comfortably obtained with @xmath113 for all partial waves with @xmath114 .    in order to gauge the accuracy of our calculation we compare with the last revision of the nijmegen group  @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : nijm ] we show our results computed with the dvsm method .",
    "as we see , our implementation allows for high numerical precision which can be tuned to be the highest one among other sources of uncertainties , namely statistical and systematic errors to be discussed below . if we take the quoted numbers in ref .  @xcite as significant figures , and assuming the standard round - off error rules , their numerical error is smaller than a half of the last provided digit .",
    "our results are mostly compatible with theirs but considerably more precise .",
    "it is useful to ponder on our numerical accuracy by looking into other possible integration methods . in the conventional numerov of runge - kutta methods , usually employed for smooth potentials",
    ", convergence is defined in terms of the precision of the wave function , so that one needs a large number of mesh - points .",
    "the accuracy is also an issue in momentum space calculations where the momentum grid has an ultraviolet cut - off @xmath115 which requires large matrices to make the low energy limit precise .    alternatively ,",
    "as pointed out in our previous works , the _ same _ level of accuracy and precision with much less computational cost can be achieved by taking the @xmath103 as fitting parameters themselves to nn scattering data ( or even phase - shifts or scattering amplitudes ) .",
    "this is the basic idea behind coarse graining , implicit in the work by avils  @xcite and exploited in refs .",
    "@xcite as the ds - potential samples the interaction with an integration step fixed by the maximum resolution dictated by the shortest de broglie wavelength , namely @xmath116 fm .",
    "a further advantage as compared to more conventional methods is the numerical stability of the method , since the number of arithmetic operations required with a few delta shells avoids accumulation of round - off errors .",
    "the uncertainty discussed in the previous section for some low energy parameters is purely of numerical character and does not reflect the physical accuracy inferred directly from the experimental data  @xcite nor the dependence inherited from the model used to analyze the data . in what follows",
    "we analyze the statistical and systematic uncertainties for the low energy parameters , the scattering phase shifts and the 5 complex scattering amplitudes in terms of the wolfenstein parameters .",
    "statistical uncertainties are presented in table  [ tab : leps - statistic ] which shows the low energy np threshold parameters of all partial waves with @xmath117 for the ds - ope potential presented in  @xcite . to propagate statistical uncertainties we use our recent monte carlo bootstrap to nn data  @xcite , where the set of potential parameters is replicated @xmath118 times , and",
    "the mean and standard deviation provide the central value and @xmath15 confidence interval respectively .",
    "it is very important to note that even though the threshold parameters encode the low energy structure of the nn interaction the statistical uncertainties are propagated from scattering data up to @xmath14mev .",
    "this approach encodes the high accuracy of a full - fledged pwa into a model independent low energy representation featured by the ere .",
    "as we see the statistical precision is very high .",
    "we note in passing that , compared to our analysis of the @xmath49-eigen channel , the nijmegen group had about @xmath119 the data but provided _",
    "twice _ the statistical precision as we do ( see table  [ tab : nijm ] ) .",
    "this apparent inconsistency could be due to the different error propagation method .",
    "we turn now to estimate the systematic uncertainty .",
    "even though several phenomenological potentials can reproduce their contemporary nn scattering database , discrepancies have been found when comparing their corresponding phase - shifts  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pssystematic ] we show the np phase - shifts up to @xmath120mev for all partial waves with @xmath121 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is represented as a band indicating the mean and standard deviation of thirteen high - quality determinations of the np interaction , in particular the pwa from the nijmegen group  @xcite , the nijmi , nijmii , reid93  @xcite , av18  @xcite and cd - bonn  @xcite potentials , the covariant spectator model  @xcite and our model potentials ds - ope  @xcite , ds-@xmath11tpe  @xcite , gauss - ope  @xcite , gauss-@xmath11tpe , ds-@xmath12bo and gauss-@xmath12bo .",
    "we note larger discrepancies in the mixing @xmath122 parameter corresponding to the @xmath123 ( deuteron ) channel as well as the peripheral @xmath87 and @xmath100 waves ( note , however , their smallness in comparison to other partial waves ) .",
    "these thirteen determinations were not made with the same database and therefore could not be used collectively to determine the systematic uncertainty . however , the ds - ope , ds-@xmath11tpe , ds-@xmath12bo , gauss - ope , gauss-@xmath11tpe and gauss-@xmath12bo potentials are fitted to the same self - consistent database with normally distributted residuals , but their phase - shifts with statitiscal uncertainties , shown also in fig .  [",
    "fig : pssystematic ] , do not always overlap .",
    "their discrepancies are of the same order of the systematic uncertainty band . the additional data ,",
    "while reducing the statistical uncertainty , do not modify the systematic uncertainty .",
    "a thorough study of the data distribution on the @xmath124-plane could provide meaningfull information on which scattering measurements are necessary to reduce the systematic uncerntainties by avoiding an abundance bias .",
    "although the propagation of systematic uncertainties is not as direct as the statistical one , we observe that differences in phase - shifts tend to be at least an order of magnitude larger than the statistical error bars  @xcite .",
    "a similar trend is found when comparing scattering amplitudes as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rewolfenstein ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : imwolfenstein ] .",

estimate the systematic uncertainties of the nn interaction at low energies we take different realistic potentials and compare their low energy threshold parameters .",
    "any estimate of the systematic errors based on variations of the potential form or possible radial dependences will provide a lower bound to the uncertainties .",
    "besides the form of the potential used to fit the data , another source of systematic error is the selection of the data itself , due to addition of possible future data .",
    "thus , the changes from the @xmath5-selected database of the nijmegen analysis 20 years ago comprising @xmath127 np and pp scattering data  @xcite to our recent @xmath5-self - consistent database  @xcite with about @xmath37 np and pp scattering data can be taken as an estimate on how much do we expect our predictions to change when a large body of new data is incorporated .    here",
    "we consider nine realistic local or minimally non - local potentials ( i.e. containing @xmath128 dependences or quadratic tensor interactions ) such as nijmii  @xcite , reid93  @xcite , av18  @xcite , which provided a @xmath18 to the nijmegen database  @xcite , and the new ds - ope  @xcite , ds-@xmath11tpe  @xcite , gauss - ope  @xcite , gauss-@xmath11tpe , ds-@xmath12bo and gauss-@xmath12bo which also provide a @xmath18 to the granada database  @xcite . to stress the obvious , we associate the increase of about 2400 np and pp data from the nijmegen to the granada databases with an additional systematic error , foreseeing the possible impact that additional new data might have in the future  -fit . ] .",
    "the values of low energy parameters for the nijmii  @xcite , reid93  @xcite have been determined already  @xcite but numerical precision has been improved in the present work ; the values for the remaining potentials are also determined here .",
    "our results are presented in table  [ tab : leps - statistic ] ( second line of each partial wave ) which shows the mean and standard deviation of the low energy threshold parameters for the nine local potentials .",
    "comparison of the errors quoted in table  [ tab : leps - statistic ] clearly shows that the main uncertainty in the low energy parameters is due to the different representations or choices of high - quality potentials and not to the propagation of experimental uncertainties used to fix the most - likely potential chosen for the least squares @xmath3-analysis .",
    "our conclusions on systematic uncertainties at low energies are vividly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2v3v4 ] . as we see",
    "the spread of all potential results is larger than the statistical error band , which is our main point . in figures [ fig : voperators10_18 ] and [ fig : voperators18_30 ]",
    "we show our three local interactions gauss - ope  @xcite , gauss-@xmath11tpe and gauss-@xmath12bo in comparison with the av18  @xcite , reid93  @xcite and nijmii  @xcite potentials as a function of @xmath129 .",
    "again , it can clearly be seen that the spread of the different interactions , which acounts for the systematic uncertainty , is significantly larger than the statistical uncertainty inferred in the potentials from the experimental errors of the scattering data .",
    "notice however the different scale used on the @xmath125-axis of every pannel .",
    "this may make the discrepancies appear to be about the same order in all channels , which is not the case .",
    "still , the systematic spread is always larger than the statistical error bands .",
    "an interpretation of the scattering data and evaluation of the skyrme coefficients or equivalent counterterms in different partial waves was proposed in our previous works  @xcite with a focus on their scale dependence and statistical uncertainties .",
    "the trend observed in all physical observables in this paper confirms also the findings in ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the systematic uncertainties .",
    "this analysis is sufficient to prove that the lower bound on the systematic error is at least one order of magnitude larger than the statistical errors .",
    "our results show that this conclusion is valid for all the scattering properties , such as low energy parameters , phase - shifts and amplitudes .",
    "one problem we want to address has to do with the portability of our analysis and by extension of any pwa .",
    "one of the main technical problems in carrying out a pwa in nn scattering is the inclusion of many effects which are crucial to provide a convincing and statistically sound fit to experimental data . among them ,",
    "the inclusion of the long - range magnetic dipole local and anysotropic interations needs summing up about 1000 partial waves and coordinate space methods are strongly preferred over the momentum space approaches , where implementation of these indispensable effects is a real challenge still unsolved .",
    "when this project was started the idea was to provide the most relevant and portable information . traditionally it has been thought that phase - shifts with their corresponding covariance matrices obtained from the fit represent the inherent uncertainty of the interaction .",
    "our experience does not support this view , and statistically good fits to some phases at arbitrary energies do not provide statistically good fits to scattering data , most often very bad ones  @xcite .",
    "another possibility which turns out to provide a better approximation to our fit to data can be found by fitting the wolfenstein parameters within the systematic spread found from the different potentials .",
    "this obviously incorporates the correlations among the different phase shifts , but even if @xmath130 to the wolfenstein parameters we typically find @xmath131 to the data .",
    "however , in view of the results of the present paper where the form of the potential itself representing the interaction provides the largest uncertainty , we think that our results are best represented by an average over the 6 potentials analyzed here . for the lower phases this",
    "is summarized in tables  [ tab : ppisovectorps ] , [ tab : npisovectorps ] and [ tab : npisoscalarps ] and complete tables can be provided upon request . as said ,",
    "the corresponding errors are comparable with the spread found using the previous pwa carried out in the past .",
    "we summarize our results . in the present paper",
    "we have confronted statistical vs systematic errors in the description of a largest body of nn scattering below lab energy @xmath1 to date , namely @xmath0 np and pp scattering data collected from 1950 till 2013 .",
    "we use the classical statistical rules to evaluate the corresponding uncertainties of the inferred potential , after the self - consistency of the fit has been confidently established via checking tail - sensitive normality tests  @xcite .",
    "we approach the determination of systematic uncertainties by using 6 model potentials which describe the same database comprising 6713 nn scattering data in a statistically significant way .",
    "thus , we have calculated and compared phases and scattering amplitudes with their statistical uncertainties .",
    "we have also calculated the low energy threshold parameters of the coupled channel effective range expansion for all partial waves with @xmath132 by using a discrete version of the variable s - matrix method .",
    "this approach provides satisfactory numerical precision at a low computational cost , qualifying as a suitable method to compare statistical vs systematic errors .",
    "statistical uncertainties are propagated via the bootstrap method  @xcite where a family of ds - ope potential parameters is fitted after experimental data are replicated .",
    "we also made a first estimate of the systematic uncertainties of the nn interaction by taking nine different realistic potentials ( i.e. with @xmath36 ) and calculating the low energy threshold parameters with each of them .",
    "these estimates should be taken as a lower bound on the systematic uncertainties . in accordance with preliminary estimates  @xcite ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties tend to be at least an order of magnitude larger than the statistical ones .",
    "the same trend between statistical and systematic uncertainties is found when comparing phaseshifts and scattering amplitudes .",
    "the present results encode the full pwa at low energies and have a direct impact in _ ab initio _ nuclear structure calculations in nuclear physics .",
    "the low energy threshold parameters could also be used as a starting point to the determination and error propagation of low energy interactions with the proper long distance behavior in addition to the universal one pion exchange interaction .",
    "recently , there have been impressive bench - marking estimates on uncertainties based on chiral nn and nnn forces in an order by order scheme for light nuclei with @xmath133  @xcite . such estimates are much larger than our simple preliminary estimates of 0.5 mev in the binding energy per nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the upgrade of our results incorporating the present systematic errors would increase our estimate by a factor of four  @xcite .",
    "the interactions we have designed in this paper have the important property of being statistically equivalent for a large nn database , and thus they can be used to carry out comprehensive studies regarding different aspects of binding in finite nuclei and in particular the impact on the predictive power of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions calculations which are now underway for the lighest @xmath134 systems and will be analyzed in the future .",
