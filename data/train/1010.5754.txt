    "both the spin and orbital moments are in very good agreement with the theoretical results . the number of d - holes is lower than for pure co metal ( 1.75 and 1.5 for co@xmath0tisn deposited at 700@xmath1c and 400@xmath1c , respectively , and 2.4 for pure co@xcite ) , which indicates a rather large charge transfer to the co d states in co@xmath0tisn .",
    "it is actually even a bit lower than the theoretical value of 2.06 .",
    "while the sum rules work well for co , dynamical screening effects of the x - ray field prohibit their direct application to the early 3d transition metals.@xcite this core - hole - photoelectron interaction leads to an intermixing of the l@xmath38 and l@xmath0 resonances , which is the reason for the deviation from the statistical branching ratio of 2:1 for the two edges .",
    "the intermixing , also known as jj - mixing of the 2p@xmath39 and 2p@xmath40 levels , leads to wrong results when the sum rules are applied to the early 3d transition metals .",
    "it has been suggested by scherz that one can estimate the ti spin moment by multiplying the result from the sum rule analysis by a factor of 4.@xcite this result has been obtained on the fe / ti / fe(110 ) trilayer system . on the other hand",
    ", it must be expected that this correction factor itself depends on the actual electronic structure and thus the screening strength .",
    "the direct result from the sum rule analysis is @xmath41 for the sample deposited at 700@xmath1c , which is in good agreement with the theoretical result .",
    "in particular , an anti - parallel alignment with the co spin moment is found .",
    "it is worth to mention , that the ti orbital moment ( the apparent value is @xmath42 ) is aligned anti - parallel to the ti spin moment .",
    "the latter is in accordance with hund s rules , which expect an anti - parallel alignment of the spin and orbital moment , because the ti 3d shell is less than half filled .",
    "because of the formation of interfacial tio@xmath0 the xmcd data can not be quantified for @xmath43c .",

    "the data points correspond to measurements taken at 20k , 300k and 370k .",
    "the sample was deposited on mgo single crystals at 700@xmath1c.,width=302 ]    in general it is expected , that the xmld signal is proportional to the square of the total magnetic moment of the individual atoms ( @xmath45 ) , whereas the xmcd signal should be directly proportional to the magnetic moment ( @xmath46).@xcite comparing the xmcd and xmld signals ( normalized to the post - edge jump height @xmath47 , because the number of 3d - holes @xmath48 is different for the samples deposited at 400@xmath1c and 700@xmath1c , respectively ) for co , it is interesting to note that xmld / xmcd@xmath49 is about 65% larger for the sample deposited at 400@xmath1c than for the 700@xmath1c sample . in the simple picture that the proportionality factors @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the same for both deposition temperatures , this means that in the disordered 400@xmath1c sample some of the co atoms are anti - ferromagnetically coupled to the other co atoms . on the other hand",
    "it is known , that the xmld effect can become quite large in systems with localized electrons .",
    "the magnitude of the xmld is given essentially by the magnetic moment and the 2p level exchange splitting , which itself is proportional to the magnetic moment .",
    "actually , without the exchange splitting of the 2p levels , the xmld would vanish .",
    "localized 3d electron states increase the 2p-3d exchange interaction , giving rise to an enhanced xmld .",
    "@xcite therefore , the decrease of xmld / xmcd@xmath49 with the deposition temperature could also hint to a higher degree of localization of the co moments for the 400@xmath1c sample .",
    "this is in agreement with an oxidized surface , in which the electrons should be more localized .",
    "however , the fine structure at the co-@xmath52 edges becomes more pronounced for higher deposition temperature ( see fig . [",
    "fig : c]a , [ fig : d]a and [ fig : d]c ) which might indicate a higher degree of localization for higher deposition temperatures .",
    "the electron localization would give the co a more atomic character , and atomic multiplets would become important , giving rise to a fine structure on the x - ray absorption spectrum . on the other hand , this would contradict the xmld result .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the xmld for @xmath53c is 5.7% at the co l@xmath38 edge in the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "thus , the co 3d states take an intermediate position between the elemental ferromagnets co and fe , that have around 2% , and strongly localized systems like mn in ( ga , mn)as , which has about 12%.@xcite obviously , this discrepancy needs to be investigated by direct _ ab initio _ calculations of the absorption spectra , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .    for the sample deposited at 700@xmath1c",
    "the xmcd and xmld effect was studied also at elevated temperatures .",
    "the normalized xmcd signals of co and ti have the same shape at 20k , 300k and 370k .",
    "furthermore , the ti xmcd asymmetry changes by the same factor as the co asymmetry between 20k and 370k .",
    "therefore the ratio between the ti and co magnetic moments is not significantly changed at elevated temperatures .",

    "the experimental and the feff9 spectra are scaled to 1 in the post - edge region .",
    "the sprkkr spectra are scaled to match the experimental l@xmath38 resonance .",
    "the theoretical spectra are aligned in energy with the experimental spectrum.,width=302 ]    as discussed above , the fine structure observed at the co l@xmath4 edges can have its origin in atomic multiplet effects related to electron localization or simply in the particular ( itinerant ) electronic structure of co@xmath0tisn . the experimental xas and xmcd spectra are compared to calculations with sprkkr and feff9 in fig .",
    "[ fig : co_comparison ] .",
    "the sprkkr spectra show broad edges and some weak shoulders on the high energy side of the white lines .",
    "the xmcd intensity is significantly too small with respect to the xas intensity .",
    "further , the ratio of the l@xmath38 and l@xmath0 xmcd signals is incorrect , the l@xmath38 xmcd is too small .",
    "bekenov _ et al .",
    "_ have calculated the xas / xmcd spectra of cts _ ab initio _ using the spin polarized relativistic linear - muffin - tin - orbital ( spr lmto ) method.@xcite their simulations do not reproduce the double - peak structures and are rather similar to our sprkkr spectra .    in feff9 , the sprkkr spectrum can be principally reproduced when the ground state density is used . instead ,",
    "if the density in the presence of a screened core hole is calculated , we find a structure that is very similar to the experimental spectrum . because the self - consistency algorithm of feff9 is only accurate within 1 ev in its determination of the fermi energy , one can use a small energy shift for fitting , thereby moving e@xmath54 within the density of states ( dos ) . with a shift of -0.2ev we obtained the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : co_comparison ] . obviously , both the double - peak structure of the white line as well as the small shoulder 4ev above the white line are reproduced .",
    "also the double - peak structure of the xmcd signal is well reproduced .",
    "notably , not only the shape of the spectrum is basically correct , but also the intensities match the experimental data very well .",
    "however , the double - peak splitting of the l@xmath38 line is underestimated calculated as 1.3ev , compared to a measured splitting of 1.5ev .    since feff9 is based on the local density approximation within the density functional theory  and thus relies on single - particle theory  it does not account for atomic multiplet effects , which naturally are many - body effects arising from wave - function coupling .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the features observed in our experimental spectra do not arise from multiplet effects and electron localization . instead , they are features arising from the excited state band structure due to the presence of a core - hole .",
    "this is consistent with the xmld measurements discussed above , which indicate rather itinerant moments .",
    "our conclusion is further supported by the analysis given by klaer _",
    "et al . _ , who found that the observed structures can not be explained by charge - transfer multiplet theory.@xcite they state that the splitting arises from a nearly pure co e@xmath55 state above e@xmath54 giving rise to the first peak , and from a co - ti hybrid state of t@xmath56 character , which results in the second peak .",
    "since the t@xmath56 states have more itinerant character , the core hole is more screened by the surrounding atoms , while the e@xmath55 states are significantly lowered in energy .",
    "this core - hole correlation energy @xmath57 was assumed to be 0.5ev and confirmed by a measurement on co@xmath0tisi . neglecting the ( only weak ) energy dependence of the transition matrix elements , and using this core - hole correlation energy and spectral deconvolution",
    ", they finally found that the fermi level of co@xmath0tisn is at the edge of the minority valence band , i.e. , co@xmath0tisn would be on the verge of being a half - metal . with the same method",
    ", they found that co@xmath0mnsi has half - metallic character for the unoccupied density of states .    using the feff9 calculations , we can invert this procedure . from",
    "_ ab initio _ calculations we found the fermi energy by fitting the experimental spectrum .",
    "now we can use the same fermi energy and investigate the ground state dos calculated by feff9 .",
    "the co site projected _ _",
    "d__dos are shown together with the sprkkr calculation in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_comparison ] .",
    "first , we shall note that the ground state dos from feff9 and the sprkkr calculation produce principally the same features , but feff9 underestimates the splitting between the bonding and the anti - bonding states .",
    "this is because of the spherical potential approximation and the use of the von barth - hedin exchange correlation potential .",
    "the unoccupied dos is however in good agreement . because of finite cluster size effects",
    ", the dos from feff9 is broadened .",
    "the minority states gap can be identified just below the calculated fermi level .",
    "when comparing the dos in presence of the core hole to the ground state , we find that the curve is mainly shifted to lower energies by @xmath58ev . in the unoccupied dos ,",
    "this is best seen for the minority e@xmath55 peak , which shifts below the calculated e@xmath54 .",
    "instead , the co - ti t@xmath56 peak at 1.4ev remains essentially unaltered .",
    "that is in remarkable agreement with the procedure given by klaer _",
    "et al._. when the same fermi level is applied to the ground state density as to the excited state density , we can conclude from our data that co@xmath0tisn has half - metallic character with e@xmath54 right below the minority valence band ( see dotted energy level in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_comparison ] ) .",
    "finally , we shall discuss the limitations of our model .",
    "as mentioned above , the _ ab initio _",
    "calculation underestimates the double - peak splitting of the xas by about 0.2ev .",
    "this introduces an uncertainty in the fermi energy determination by spectral fitting of the order of the correction itself . with the currently available level of _ ab initio _",
    "theory this issue can not be resolved and it remains unclear if co@xmath0tisn is a half - metallic ferromagnet .",
    "at least , a full potential treatment would be desirable , and spin self - consistency with more advanced exchange correlation functionals may help to resolve problems with the exchange splitting . on the other hand ,",
    "the sprkkr calculation finds the t@xmath56 peak at slightly lower energy than feff9 .",
