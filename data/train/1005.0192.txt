    "a new iron age has occurred in the field of superconductivity and started when the discovery of the lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath8 superconductor in 2008 gave rise to a huge interest in depressed superconductivity division @xcite . over the past two years",
    ", an enormous number of papers have been published and more than 70 new iron - based superconductors have been discovered @xcite . generally , iron - based superconductors are classified as refeaso ( 1111 family , re : rare earths ) , aefe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( 122 family , ae : alkaline earths ) , afeas ( 111 family , a : li , na ) , and fech ( 11 family , ch : chalcogens ) . among these families , a tetragonal phase fese is an attractive material for finding the origin of iron - based superconductors due to its simple crystal structure @xcite .",
    "it has just superconducting layers without block layers , and its superconducting critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) is very sensitive to change in the strain .",
    "although the @xmath1 of bulk fese is as low as 8.5 k , its @xmath1 can be raised to 37 k under pressure @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1 of fese@xmath9te@xmath9 thin films can be enhanced to 21 k by controlling the biaxial strain @xcite .",
    "however , compared with te- or s - doped superconductors @xcite , research on pure fese superconductors is rarely carried out .",
    "synthesis of single - phase fese superconductors with a tetragonal structure is not easy because it has several types of phases , such as tetragonal ( pbo - type ) , hexagonal ( nias - type ) , and fe@xmath10se@xmath11 phases @xcite .",
    "moreover , most of them , except for the tetragonal phase , are known to be ferromagnetic phases @xcite . according to recent reports @xcite , the possibility of ferromagnetism was presented in fese thin films with a tetragonal structure at temperature near room temperature , but this issue is still under debate .",
    "nevertheless , the observation of superconductivity in the tetragonal phase of fese by hsu @xmath12 @xcite has offered a new member ( 11 family ) to the class of iron - based superconductors .",
    "also , an expectation of a higher @xmath1 in fete than in fese , which is caused by strong paring @xcite , has brought about active research on the fe - te - se system @xcite .",
    "if the intrinsic properties are to be investigated precisely , undoped fese or fete single crystals with large sizes or thin films are required because isovalent substitution induces lattice strain due to the different ionic sizes .",
    "very recently , han @xmath12 @xcite and si @xmath12 @xcite reported the appearance of superconductivity in fete films due tensile stress effects and oxygen incorporation , respectively , while no superconductivity was observed in bulk samples @xcite . in the case of fese films ,",
    "only a few papers have been published @xcite , and the experimental results are still unsatisfactory compared to those for bulk samples .",
    "furthermore , there has been little progress in the growth of pure fese films whereas some research groups have fabricated high - quality te - doped fese thin films @xcite .    in this work , we report the fabrication of fese@xmath0 films with a bulk @xmath1 of @xmath2 k on several types of substrates , al@xmath3o@xmath4(0001 ) [ ao ] , srtio@xmath4(100 ) [ sto ] , mgo(100 ) , and laalo@xmath4(100 ) [ lao ] , by using a pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) technique .",
    "all samples were grown at a high substrate temperature of 610 @xmath5c and showed high upper critical fields with a ( 101 ) preferred orientation .",
    "homemade fese targets having a stoichiometric ratio of fe : se = 1:1 were used in this study , and the laser beam was generated by using a lambda physik krf excimer laser ( @xmath13 = 248 nm ) .",
    "our pld system is described in detail elsewhere @xcite . a laser energy density of 1.15 j/@xmath14",
    ", a high repetition rate of 48 hz , and high substrate temperature ( @xmath15 ) of 610 @xmath5c were used for the deposition of fese@xmath0 films in a high vacuum state of @xmath16 10@xmath17 torr .",
    "the high frequency of the laser is favorable for the fabrication of films containing highly - volatile materials @xcite .",
    "high growth rates of @xmath18 nm / s were obtained under these growth conditions .",
    "the compositional ratio of the deposited films was fe : se = 1:0.90@xmath60.02 .",
    "the crystal phases and orientations of the fabricated fese@xmath0 films were investigated by using x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) .",
    "the surface morphology and thickness were checked by using scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) .",
    "the elemental composition ratio was analyzed by using energy dispersive spectroscopy ( eds ) based on the results for a standard stoichiometric sample . a vibrating sample measurement system ( squid - vsm , quantum design ) and a physical property measurement system ( ppms , quantum design ) were used for the study of their superconducting properties .",
    "the temperature dependences of the resistivity ( @xmath19 ) of the fese@xmath0 films are shown in figure 1 .",
    "a se deficiency of @xmath20 = 0.10@xmath60.02 , which was comparable with previously reported samples @xcite , was examined by using eds .",
    "all of the deposited films showed a @xmath21 of @xmath2 k and a @xmath22 of @xmath23 k , and their transition widths ( @xmath24@xmath1 ) decreased with increasing residual resistivity ratio ( rrr ) ; these data are summarized in table 1 .",
    "all these data are very close to the previous results for bulk samples @xcite and show a higher @xmath22 and a narrower @xmath24@xmath1 than previously reported @xcite . in figure 1(a ) , the @xmath19(@xmath25 ) of the film grown on a sto substrate is multiplied by 5 because it has small values compared with those of the other film .",
    "the change of slope around 120 k seems to originate from the influence of a spin - density wave ( sdw ) @xcite .",

    "figure 1(b ) is a magnified view near the superconducting transition temperature ; the resistivity values are normalized to those at 15 k. the inset shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization ( @xmath28 ) of the fese@xmath0 film fabricated on a sto substrate .",
    "the clear diamagnetic signal indicates that it has good bulk superconductivity .",
    "although the irreversible temperature of @xmath16 6 k in the @xmath29 curve is lower than the @xmath1 obtained from @xmath19(@xmath25 ) , obtaining the superconducting signal from magnetization measurements in fese superconductors is not easy due to its intrinsic magnetism @xcite or its magnetic impurities , such as hexagonal fese phases and fe impurities @xcite .",

    "no peak shift is detected regardless of the substrate .",
    "we believe that this is due to the growth direction of the film being along the ( 101 ) direction rather than along the @xmath33-axis or the @xmath34-axis .",
    "wang @xmath12 @xcite reported that the orientation of the t(101 ) direction is the key to fabricating of fese@xmath0 films with strong superconductivity .",
    "the surface morphologies of the fese@xmath0 films on the ao , sto , mgo , and lao substrates were checked by using scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the sem images , ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , show that compared with previous reports @xcite , all films have well - connected morphologies without cracks , which is one factor in obtaining higher - quality samples with a sharper superconducting transition .",
    "the white tiny grains in figure 3(b ) were shown to be fe particles by using eds .",
    "films grown on lao had larger fe lumps than ones grown on sto .",
    "these fe lumps , which were ferromagnetic , are a possible source of the proximity effect that accompanies a suppression of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these locally weakened superconducting regions generate a broad superconducting transition .",
    "the thicknesses determined from the sem cross - sectional images in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) are 1.5 , 1.6 , 1.6 , and 1.8 @xmath35 m , respectively .",

    "the inset presents the linear fittings for @xmath7(@xmath25 ) at @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . ]    finally , we investigated the temperature dependence of the upper critical magnetic field ( @xmath7(@xmath25 ) ) for the fese@xmath0 films .",
    "figure 4 displays the @xmath39 curves of the film prepared on a sto substrate for various magnetic fields from 0 to 7 t , and the inset shows the fitting of @xmath7(@xmath25 ) .",
    "the data points were obtained from the @xmath39 curves for three defined criteria ; @xmath38 ( 90% of @xmath40 ) , @xmath37 ( 50% of @xmath40 ) , and @xmath36 ( 10% of @xmath40 ) are equivalent to critical temperatures of @xmath21 , @xmath41 , and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath7(0 ) at @xmath38 are 58 , 56 , 50 , and 57 t for films grown on ao , sto , mgo , and lao substrates , respectively , which were estimated by using a linear extrapolation @xcite .",
    "these high values of @xmath7(0 ) open up the possibility for practical applications , provided we can grow better films with higher values of @xmath1 .",

    "all films were preferentially oriented along the ( 101 ) direction , and showed upper critical fields as high as 50 t. our results showed that ( 101)-oriented fese@xmath0 films with bulk superconductivity could be fabricated at high growth temperature regardless of type of substrate ."
