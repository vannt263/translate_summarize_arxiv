    "entangled states of light are the fundamental resource of many quantum communication and information protocols @xcite . especially desirable for future quantum networks",
    "are quantum connections between atomic transitions and light that can be transmitted via telecom fibers .",
    "fibers with an ultralow attenuation of 0.17db / km at 1550 nm are commercially available today @xcite , while quantum states can be stored in alkaline atoms @xcite that absorb and emit light at wavelengths around 810 nm @xcite . recently , li _ et  al .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated the generation of bright entangled twin beams at these wavelength , using single ended filter cavities to detect the entanglement @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the experimental realization of a continuous wave ( cw ) source of entanglement between 810 and 1550 nm in the continuous variable ( cv ) regime . a non - degenerate optical parametric oscillator ( nopo )",
    "was used and operated above threshold .",
    "in contrast to @xcite we used filter cavities to generate local oscillators ( lo ) for a full balanced homodyne ( bhd ) measurement .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup ] shows the experimental setup .",
    "the light source of our experiment was a nd : yag laser of 2.1w output power at 1064 nm .",
    "the laser beam was first sent through a ring cavity ( mc_1 ) with a finesse of @xmath2 , corresponding to a linewidth of 2.7mhz .",
    "reduction of mode distortions of the laser s tem_00 spatial mode profile and technical noise above the cavity s linewidth were ensured .",
    "the cavity length was controlled using the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) locking scheme @xcite with a phase modulation at a sideband frequency of 15mhz .",
    "the output of 1.6w was sent directly to the second harmonic generation ( shg ) to provide the pump field for the nopo .",
    "the shg was made of a 7% doped mgo : linbo_3 crystal .",
    "the curved back surface of the crystal had a high - reflection coating ( @xmath3% ) whereas the flat surface had an anti - reflection coating ( @xmath4% ) for both wavelengths .",
    "the shg used an out - coupling mirror with power reflectivities of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the modulation sidebands transmitted through mc_1 at 15mhz were used to control the cavity length with the pdh locking scheme . the generated second - harmonic field had a power of up to 1w .    a second filter cavity ( mc_2 ) was used to ensure a tem_00 spatial mode profile and suppressed technical noise of the pump beam .",
    "the finesse was @xmath7 , corresponding to a linewidth of 1.3mhz .",
    "a phase modulation at 1.36mhz was provided to generate the error signal for mc_2 and later used cavities , again using the pdh locking scheme .    in our experiment",
    "the entanglement was generated in a monolithic standing wave non - linear cavity .",
    "the non - linear medium inside the cavity was a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) crystal .",
    "the phase matching for 532 , 810 and 1550 nm was given at a temperature of 68@xmath8c , which was stabilized actively .",
    "the length of the crystal was 8.9 mm and the coatings were chosen to form a cavity with a finesse of @xmath9 for the twin beams .",
    "hence , the linewidth of both modes was 91mhz .",
    "the radii of curvature of 8 mm led to a waist size of 24@xmath10 m for the pump beam , which simply double passed the crystal .",
    "the threshold power was about 120mw .",
    "the bright output fields were co - propagating and spatially separated with a dichroic beam splitter ( dbs ) .",
    "( left ) to @xmath11 ( right ) .",
    "the dotted green and dashed red traces correspond to the variances measured on the individual beams at alice s and bob s site , respectively .",
    "the minima of the two blue traces correspond to half the variances in eq.([eq : insep ] ) thereby fulfilling the inequality with @xmath12 . ]    to measure the entanglement by means of bhd detection filter mode cleaner ( fmc ) were introduced to separate the sideband from the carrier fields @xcite .",
    "the latter served as los for the bhd measurements .",
    "the filter cavities were triangular ring resonators with a finesse of @xmath13 for 810 and 1550 nm .",
    "the twin beams were sent to their corresponding filter cavity and treated in the same manner .",
    "an error signal was generated with the pdh scheme using the converted phase modulation of the green pump field at 1.36mhz .",
    "the transmitted beam served as an optical lo .",
    "the reflected part ( containing the quantum properties ) and the lo were brought to interference on the 50/50 beam splitter .",
    "the detection took place with a purpose built photodetector , where the photocurrents were directly subtracted on the circuit board .",
    "both bhd signals were demodulated at 63.9mhz , low pass filtered at 50khz and fed into a data acquisition system .",
    "the calculation of the variances of each signal and the variance of the difference of the two signals was conducted by pc software . to ensure a constant lo power ,",
    "the dc voltage of the fmc were recorded .    to perform the measurement ,",
    "the nopo was operated just above threshold and pumped with 130mw .",
    "we obtained 2.7 and 1.4mw lo power , which led to a dark noise clearance of 4 and 6db for the 810 and 1550 nm detectors , respectively .",
    "the inseparability criterion @xcite is a necessary and sufficient criterion for entanglement . for our setup",
    "it can be written in the form @xmath14",
    "@xmath15 denotes variances , with the variance of a vacuum field normalized to unity . @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the fields quadrature phase operators at alice s and bob s site for which the variance of their difference @xmath18 is minimal . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the quadrature phase operators orthogonal to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : result ] presents consecutive measurement time series of @xmath21 ( dotted green ) , @xmath22 ( dashed red ) , and @xmath23 ( blue ) on the left side and @xmath24 ( dotted green ) , @xmath25 ( dashed red ) , and @xmath26 ( blue ) on the right side . during the measurement time",
    "shown , the bhd phase at alice s site was repeatedly ramped up and down and bob s site was switched from a @xmath27 ( left ) to a @xmath11 ( right ) measurement .",
    "additionally , the vacuum noise levels of the detectors were measured and used to normalize the traces shown .",
    "contemplating the individual variances one recognizes a non - uniform noise distribution among the quadratures . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : insep ] ) , the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] demonstrates the presence of entanglement .",
    "the minima of the blue trace on the left side corresponds to a measurement where alice and bob were set to their @xmath27 quadrature ( green and red trace , lower noise ) with @xmath28 . on the right side the minima of the blue trace corresponds to a measurement where alice and bob were set to their @xmath11 quadrature ( green and red trace , higher noise ) with @xmath29 .",
    "both orthogonal quadratures are showing quantum correlations and together this yields @xmath30 , corresponding to @xmath1db non - classical quadrature correlations .",
    "the data presented has not been corrected for the contribution of electronic dark noise .",
    "in conclusion , two - color continuous variable entanglement between the wavelength of 810 and 1550 nm was experimentally demonstrated .",
    "the source was an above threshold driven nopo made of a ppktp crystal .",
    "the entanglement was verified by the inseparability criterion and resulted in @xmath31 . by using filter cavities to generate lo for the bhd measurements",
    ", we could observe all quadrature phase angles without restrictions to certain frequency bands .",
