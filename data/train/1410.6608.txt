    "biaxial hard - particle systems have received considerable theoretical and experimental attention since their first theoretical prediction by freiser @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of the biaxial phase is that two directions of orientational ordering occur associated with two molecular symmetry axes @xcite .",
    "the importance of studying biaxial nematic phases is that they might be used in practical applications , such as fast electro - optical devices @xcite .",
    "the theoretical exploration of stable biaxial nematic order has been based on biaxial hard - body and gay - berne - type soft potential models , using specific particle shapes such as spheroplatelets @xcite , biaxial ellipsoids @xcite and bent - core particles @xcite . the biaxial nematic phase has also been found in binary mixtures of uniaxial plate - like and rod - like particles @xcite . however , the experimental realization of this exotic phase has proved to be rather complicated .",
    "the first observation dates back to the study of yu and saupe @xcite , who observed that a mixture of potassium laurate , 1-decanol , and water exhibited a region of biaxial order between two uniaxial phases .",
    "later , biaxial nematic order was observed in low molecular weight thermotropic liquid crystals where the constituting particles had biaxial symmetry @xcite .",
    "regarding the shape of the constituting particles , banana - shaped mesogenic molecules are found to form thermotropic biaxial nematic phase @xcite , while board - shaped colloidal particles have been used successfully in the stabilization of lyotropic biaxial nematic phases @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental observation of biaxial nematic order in suspensions of board - like goethite nanorods @xcite has prompted several theoretical studies in order to determine the global phase behavior of hard board - shaped particles @xcite and also to identify those processes which promote the formation of the biaxial nematic phase @xcite .",
    "interestingly , an increasing polydispersity in shape and size favors the biaxial nematic phase over other ordered phases @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , binary mixtures consisting of board - shaped particles with added polymers can stabilize biaxial order very efficiently @xcite .",
    "even the biaxiality of the nematic phase can be tuned by applying an external magnetic field @xcite .    by inserting goethite nanorods into a soft lamellar matrix of non - ionic surfactant ,",
    "it is also possible to examine the effect of dimensional reduction on the stability of mesophases @xcite .",
    "the confined nanorods between the bilayers of a lamellar phase have been shown to undergo a first - order in - plane ( two - dimensional ) isotropic - nematic phase transition , where the isotropic and nematic phases correspond to planar and biaxial nematic phases , respectively . in the light of increasing amount of knowledge about the ordering properties of board - shaped goethite nanorods in confined geometries ,",
    "it is worth studying the phase behaviour of hard board - shaped particles in quasi - two - dimensions using theoretical methods , and this is the motivation of our work .    in the present study we use density - functional theory in the fundamental - measure version to examine the orientational and positional ordering properties of confined hard - board colloidal particles with discrete orientations .",
    "the confinement is such that the centers of the board particles are always on a flat surface .",
    "we mainly focus on the effect of shape biaxiality on the stability of the biaxial nematic phase , but we also determine the stability regions of other mesophases such as the uniaxial nematic and positionally - ordered smectic , columnar and solid phases using bifurcation analysis .",
    "an important result is that an increasing biaxiality does not promote the formation of biaxial nematic phases due to the free - volume maximizing effect of the packing entropy .",

    "[ las_6 ] is that , for particular values of the parameters @xmath119 , the total number of transitions between uniform phases ( n@xmath36 and n@xmath37 ) can be one or three ( the latter case associated with reentrant phases ) .",

    "there are important differences between the three cases : while the biaxial order of plate - like particles increases from the bifurcation point and finally saturates at its maximum value , rod - like particles exhibit a rather small biaxial order in the range of densities where the n@xmath37 phase is stable . finally , for @xmath27 a small region of biaxial order ( with relatively small order parameter ) is followed by a second transition to a second n@xmath37 phase possessing a high degree of biaxiality up to the transition to a non - uniform phase .",
    "this trend is general for any @xmath2 : the n@xmath37 phase of rod - like particles exhibits only a small degree of global biaxial ordering , quantified through the order parameter @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , its stability is questionable for the freely - rotating case .",
    "in this work we studied the effect of particle biaxiality on the phase behaviour of liquid - crystal colloidal monolayers , using a fundamental - measure density - functional theory for hard board - like biaxial particles with restricted orientations .",

    "this study is an extension of our previous work in which monolayers of uniaxial rod - like and plate - like particles were analysed @xcite .",
    "contrary to expected , particle biaxiality destabilizes the biaxial phase in the cases where the latter is present , a phenomenon directly related with the competition between ( i ) the biaxiality promoted by the two - dimensional spatial constraint on particle centres of mass , and ( ii ) the biaxial ordering promoted by particle biaxiality for high enough densities . for biaxial particles the rectangular projected areas are inequivalent , and the mixing entropy stabilizes , mainly for plate - like geometry , the 2d isotropic phase .    for rod - like geometry",
    "the n@xmath37 phase has a small degree of biaxial orderer and occurs in a narrow interval of densities .",

    "the phase diagram exhibits a density gap in which the n@xmath37 is stable for any value of particle biaxiality @xmath22 .",
    "the transitions between nematic phases are continuous , except for a small range of values of @xmath22 about zero and for large values of @xmath21 , where a first - order n@xmath36-n@xmath37 transition appears .",
    "a packing fraction inversion phenomenon also exists .",
    "the rapid increase of particle alignment along @xmath6 , resulting in a large fraction of the projected species with the smallest area , compensates the total increment in number of particles , resulting in a decrease of @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "the presence of a n@xmath37 phase in the rod - like region of the phase diagram ( @xmath54 ) should be taken with care , as it could be a direct consequence of the restriction on particle orientations .",
    "as shown by monte carlo simulations and parsons - lee density - functional theory , uniaxial freely - rotating plate - like ellipsoidal particles adsorbed on a monolayer without orientational restrictions do exhibit a n@xmath37 phase , while their rod - like counterparts do not @xcite",
