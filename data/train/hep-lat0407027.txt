    "qcd at a finite chemical potential @xmath2 for quark - number , has a complex fermion determinant , which makes the naive application of standard lattice simulation methods , which are based on importance sampling , difficult if not impossible .",
    "to circumvent these problems people have introduced various schemes which are applicable to high temperatures and small @xmath2 .",
    "these include various reweighting techniques @xcite , and methods which expand physical observables as power series in @xmath2 @xcite or related parameters @xcite .",
    "another approach is to study theories which are expected to possess some of the properties of qcd at finite @xmath2 , but have real positive fermion determinants , making them amenable to standard simulation methods .",
    "one such theory is qcd at finite chemical potential @xmath0 for isospin ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this theory has been studied both by effective ( chiral ) lagrangian techniques @xcite , as well as by direct lattice simulations @xcite . at zero temperature",
    "these studies indicate that this theory undergoes a second - order phase transition with mean - field critical exponents at @xmath10 , to a state characterized by a charged pion condensate which breaks @xmath7 spontaneously .",
    "we report here a study of 2-flavour lattice qcd at finite @xmath0 and finite temperature ( @xmath11 ) , in the neighbourhood of the finite temperature transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "since we work at finite quark mass to make the pion massive and thus to move pion condensation to finite @xmath0 , the finite temperature transitions form a line of crossovers emanating from the @xmath12 transition , for small @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate the position of this crossover as a function of @xmath0 on an @xmath1 lattice for 3 different quark masses ( @xmath13 ) , from the peaks of the susceptibilities of the various observables , using ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting to interpolate between the @xmath14 values used in our simulations . for @xmath4",
    ", we set the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath9 . from estimations of the fluctuations of the phase of the fermion determinant for small quark - number chemical potential @xmath2 we shall argue that there is an appreciable range of @xmath2 over which these fluctuations are small enough that the position of the crossover at finite @xmath2 will be the same as that at finite @xmath0 with @xmath3 .",
    "we find good agreement with the @xmath2 dependence of this transition observed by de forcrand and philipsen @xcite .",
    "this agreement between the @xmath2 and @xmath0 dependence of the transition @xmath15 and hence temperature was noted by the bielefeld - swansea group @xcite .",
    "we also find that the transition for each of our 3 masses appears to remain a crossover with no sign of a critical endpoint for all @xmath4 .",
    "preliminary results from these simulations have been presented at conferences @xcite .",
    "we have also studied the finite temperature transition for @xmath6 . here , for symmetry breaking parameter @xmath9 , the pion condensate evaporates at the finite temperature transition , which is thus a true phase transition .",
    "however , since here the fermion propagator becomes singular ( at least in the infinite volume limit ) for temperatures below this transition , because of the goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of @xmath7 , we are forced to work at finite ( small ) @xmath8 , where the transition again becomes a crossover . here",
    "we shall present evidence for a critical endpoint beyond which the transition becomes first order . because @xmath8 is small , we shall argue that this first order behaviour persists to @xmath9 . at @xmath9 ,",
    "the finite temperature crossover is replaced by a second order transition , the first order transition remains first order and the critical endpoint becomes a tricritical point .",
    "although most of our simulations were performed on @xmath1 lattices , we performed some simulations on @xmath16 lattices close to the critical endpoint .    in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce lattice qcd at finite @xmath0 . in section 3",

    "section 6 contains discussions and conclusions .",
    "the staggered quark action for lattice qcd at finite chemical potential @xmath0 for isospin ( @xmath7 ) is @xmath17\\chi                     + i\\lambda\\epsilon\\bar{\\chi}\\tau_2\\chi\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the standard staggered quark transcription of @xmath19 with the links in the @xmath20 direction multiplied by @xmath21 and those in the @xmath22 direction multiplied by @xmath23 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath8 is an explicit @xmath24 symmetry breaking term .",
    "this term serves two purposes .",
    "firstly , such a term is necessary if one is to see evidence for spontaneous @xmath7 breaking on a finite lattice .",
    "secondly , it prevents the dirac operator from becoming singular , as we see below .",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the isospin matrices so that this dirac operator is a @xmath28 matrix in isospin space .",

    "we note that , for @xmath9 , the determinant of equation  [ eqn : det ] is just the magnitude of the determinant for 8-flavour lattice qcd with quark - number chemical potential @xmath32    observables for this theory include the chiral condensate , @xmath33 the charged pion condensate @xmath34 and the isospin density @xmath35 we will also be interested in the wilson line ( polyakov loop ) , and the plaquette observable @xmath36",
    "if @xmath37 is an observable , its 4-th order binder cumulant is defined by @xmath38 which approaches a universal value at a critical point @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out if one chooses @xmath37 to be an eigenvector of the critical scaling hamiltonian , @xmath5 will be as close as is possible to its infinite volume limit on finite volumes @xcite . if one plots @xmath5 as a function of those parameters which parameterize the departure from the critical point , the curves obtained for different lattice sizes will intersect at the critical point if @xmath37 is indeed an eigenvector . for other choices of @xmath37 the intersections of such curves will only tend to this unique value in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the value of the cumulant at this point of intersection will be that characteristic of the universality class of this critical point and the nature of the observable .    for transitions other than critical points",
    ", the binder cumulant only attains its characteristic value in the infinite volume limit . for a crossover ,",
    "the infinite volume value for the binder cumulant for the order parameter is @xmath39 . for a first order transition ,",
    "this binder cumulant is @xmath40 .",

    "we have simulated 2-flavour qcd on @xmath1 lattices in the neighbourhood of the finite temperature transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma , for small values of the isospin ( @xmath7 ) chemical potential @xmath0 . here",
    "small @xmath0 means @xmath4 so that , even at zero temperature , the system is in the normal phase , i.e. in the phase where there is no @xmath7-breaking charged pion condensate .",
    "we set @xmath9 , since a finite @xmath8 is only needed when there is a possibility of spontaneous @xmath7 breaking .",
    "simulations were performed at 3 different quark masses @xmath13 .    at the lowest quark mass @xmath46 we performed simulations over a range of @xmath0 values @xmath47 , where the highest @xmath0 value is only just below the critical @xmath0 above which a pion condensate forms at low temperature .",
    "the larger quark masses were chosen to allow an even larger range of @xmath0s for the normal phase .",
    "for @xmath48 we simulated over the range @xmath49 , while for @xmath50 we covered the range @xmath51 . at each of the selected @xmath0 values we performed simulations over a range of @xmath15 values spanning the finite temperature transition .",
    "we used a range of updating increments ( in molecular - dynamics ` time ' ) for these simulations .",
    "these ranged from @xmath52 for @xmath53 and small @xmath0 down to @xmath54 for @xmath46 and @xmath55 close to the transition . for each quark mass",
    "we performed simulations as long as @xmath56 molecular - dynamics time units ( trajectories ) at individual values of @xmath57 close to a transition .    at each value of @xmath58 , @xmath0 and @xmath14",
    "we measured the average plaquette , the wilson line ( polyakov loop ) , the chiral condensate and the isospin density for each trajectory .",
    "for the fermionic quantities , where we calculate stochastic estimates , we used 5 noise vectors for each trajectory , which enabled us to make unbiased estimates of the susceptibilities and binder cumulants .",
    "figure  [ fig : wilson0.05 ] shows the wilson line as a function of @xmath14 for each @xmath0 at quark mass @xmath46 .",
    "note that there is a rapid crossover marking the transition .",
    "in addition we see that the position of the crossover moves towards smaller @xmath14 and hence lower temperature as @xmath0 is increased . however , we notice that the crossover @xmath14 , @xmath59 varies only slowly with @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding values of the chiral condensate , @xmath60 are given in figure  [ fig : pbp0.05 ] .",
    "again we see a rapid crossover close to the position of that for the wilson line .",
    "figure  [ fig : j0_0.05 ] shows the behaviour of the isospin density @xmath61 for the same mass and @xmath0s .",
    "here we see the finite temperature transition again .",
    "we note that the value of the isospin density in the quark - gluon plasma ( high @xmath14 ) increases with increasing @xmath0 . at each @xmath0",
    "it appears to level off at large @xmath14 .",
    "note that this is not the lattice artifact of saturation ; @xmath61 in this domain is far below its saturation value of @xmath62 .",
    "the rise in @xmath61 occurs because increasing @xmath0 raises the fermi surface .",
    "these observables for @xmath48 and @xmath50 behave very similarly to those for @xmath46 , except that the crossovers occur at larger @xmath14 values as mass is increased .",
    "the transitions we have observed in each of these masses and chemical potentials appear to be smooth crossovers rather than actual phase transitions , as is expected to be the case for @xmath12 ( we will present further evidence for this later in this section ) .",
    "the position of the transition is thus defined as the @xmath14 value which maximizes a chosen susceptibility .",
    "( such definitions and ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting are used by other groups , as are the binder cumulant methods used below @xcite.)this is a reasonable definition only if the positions of the maxima of the susceptibilities for the various observables are close , at least in the infinite volume limit . the susceptibility for a chosen observable @xmath63",
    "is defined as @xmath64 where v is the space - time volume of the lattice .",
    "note that this is the correct definition only for a local observable @xmath63 .",
    "we have also used this definition for the wilson loop which is only local in 3-space . thus what we call @xmath65 is strictly @xmath66 .",
    "figure  [ fig : chiplaq ] shows the plaquette susceptibilities for @xmath46 at those @xmath14s at which we performed our simulations for each @xmath0 .",
    "these susceptibilities are clearly strongly peaked , and the peaks move to lower @xmath14s as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "figure  [ fig : chiwilson ] gives the corresponding susceptibilities for the wilson / polyakov line .",
    "again these susceptibilities are strongly peaked and the peak moves to lower @xmath14 as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "the main difference is that the peaks in these susceptibilities decrease slightly in height as @xmath0 is increased , whereas those for the plaquette susceptibilities increase with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : chipbp ] shows the susceptibilities for the chiral condensate , also for @xmath46 . by using all 5 stochastic estimators of @xmath60 and removing the noise - diagonal contribution we obtain an unbiased estimate of this susceptibility    these susceptibilities are the most strongly peaked of all the susceptibilities and the height of the peaks increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "finally we show the susceptibilities for the isospin densities at @xmath46 in figure  [ fig : chij0 ] .",
    "again we used the 5 noise vectors to obtain an unbiased estimator .",
    "the rapid increase in the height of these peaks with increasing @xmath0 corresponds to the increase in @xmath61 seen in figure  [ fig : j0_0.05 ] .    in order to pinpoint the susceptibility peaks more precisely , we use the distribution of observables and plaquette actions measured during our runs and use ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting @xcite to estimate the susceptibilities at @xmath14 values close to those at which we have performed simulations . if @xmath63 is an observable for which @xmath67 , @xmath68 are the measured values ( lattice averaged ) , and @xmath69 are the corresponding plaquette actions , at @xmath70 , then @xmath71 for @xmath14 close enough to @xmath72 that the distributions of @xmath73 values at @xmath14 and @xmath72 have significant overlap . applying this formula to estimate both @xmath74 and @xmath75 yields the desired susceptibility @xmath76 .",
    "jackknife methods are used to determine the errors in both the susceptibilities and the positions of their peaks .",
    "it turns out that for our simulations at each @xmath58 and @xmath0 , we have @xmath77 @xmath14 values close enough to the peak @xmath59 to be used to determine @xmath59 . after checking that the estimates of @xmath59 from each of these points are consistent , we obtain our final estimate as a @xmath78 weighted average of these .    in figure  [",
    "fig : beta ] we plot our @xmath59 estimates from each of the 4 susceptibilities as functions of @xmath79 for all 3 masses .",
    "there is clearly good agreement between the @xmath59 values obtained from the different susceptibilities .",
    "arguments as to why this should be so have been presented in references @xcite . since for a fixed mass @xmath80 @xmath59",
    "is a function of @xmath79 .",
    "for @xmath81 small enough it is also an analytic function of @xmath0 .",
    "thus for small @xmath0 , @xmath82 we have therefore fit @xmath59 to the form @xmath83 , for each mass . choosing to fit the plaquette susceptibilities ,",
    "we get @xmath84 these lines are plotted in figure  [ fig : beta ] .",
    "since @xmath85 is @xmath86 for @xmath46 , @xmath87 for @xmath48 and @xmath88 for @xmath50 , these are not excellent fits . however , including the quartic term , does not improve the @xmath46 fit , and adding even more terms would be a meaningless exercise .",
    "it was observed by the bielefeld - swansea group that at small @xmath2 and @xmath0 , the dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath2 and on @xmath0 was identical within their errors @xcite . in our notation",
    "this would mean that @xmath89 this means that one can determine the position of the finite temperature transition for small @xmath2 by simulating with the magnitude of the fermion determinant and ignoring the phase .",
    "let us give an intuitive argument why this might be the case .",
    "if @xmath90 is the phase of the fermion determinant , and @xmath63 is a gauge - field observable ( such as the plaquette or wilson line ) then @xmath91 where for @xmath63 real we can replace @xmath92 with @xmath93 . for the lattice size used by the bielefeld - swansea group",
    ", there was a range of @xmath2 over which this denominator was not too small and varied smoothly with @xmath2 and slowly with @xmath14 , as @xmath14 swept across the @xmath59 . here",
    "the denominator can not be responsible for the transition .",
    "when the fluctuations in @xmath90 are so well behaved , it is reasonable to treat @xmath94 as another observable .",
    "since the position of the transition appears to be nearly independent of the chosen observable , this would suggest that the position of the transition would be the same for this new observable .",
    "if so , the smooth behaviour of the denominator would imply that the position of the transition at finite @xmath2 should be the same as that for the transition at finite @xmath0 for @xmath3 .",
    "it is also not unreasonable to assume that the nature of the 2 transitions might be the same .",
    "such observations are not new ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "if the relation between @xmath95 and @xmath96 holds with the standard staggered action ( the bielefeld - swansea group used the @xmath97-@xmath98 action ) we can compare our formulae for @xmath96 ( equation  [ eqn : beta_c ] ) with that obtained by de forcrand and philipsen @xcite @xmath99 where we have made the substitution @xmath100 in their equation .",
    "this would appear to be consistent with our equations , taking into account the difference in mass . to examine whether this agreement is quantitative ,",
    "we fit equations  [ eqn : beta_c],[eqn : dfp ] to the expected scaling form @xmath101 such scaling fits have been considered by @xcite at zero chemical potentials . for the expected continuum",
    "@xmath102 scaling @xmath103 , while for the lattice @xmath104 scaling @xmath105 .",
    "[ note that such scaling is only derivable for the case of finite @xmath2 , where , in the chiral limit , the line of crossovers becomes a line of second order transitions in the same universality class as the @xmath106(@xmath12 ) transition .",
    "we are using the assumed relationship between finite @xmath2 and finite @xmath0 to extend it to finite @xmath0 . ] the fit of all 4 equations to @xmath102 scaling gives @xmath107 , @xmath108 , with a @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , @xmath111 with a @xmath112 .",
    "the fit to @xmath104 scaling gives @xmath113 , @xmath114 with a @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 with a @xmath112 .",
    "considering the quality of the fits in equations  [ eqn : beta_c ] , we consider either of these scaling fits to be good enough to support our claim that we are consistent with de forcrand and philipsen , and that the combined measurements are consistent with the expected scaling with quark mass @xmath58 .",
    "note that our value of @xmath118 is less than that obtained in @xcite .",
    "we should not expect good agreement with the later paper , since it uses a larger lattice and finite size effects are non - negligible on an @xmath1 lattice .",
    "the fit in the earlier work was over the mass range @xmath119 , while ours was over the range @xmath120 .",
    "considering the rapid variation of the scaling form at small @xmath58 , the difference between our result , @xmath121 and their s , @xmath122 is perhaps not surprising .",
    "what remains to be checked is that the phase ( @xmath90 ) of the fermion determinant is well behaved .",
    "since calculating the fermion determinant is very expensive , we use the series expansion for @xmath90 given in @xcite . in our normalization ,",
    "@xmath123 where @xmath124 is the number density normalized to 4 flavours ( 1 staggered fermion field ) .",
    "we use our 5 stochastic estimators / configuration of @xmath124 to obtain an unbiased estimator of @xmath125 through order @xmath79 .",
    "( we also made an unbiased estimator of @xmath126 which had a poor enough signal / noise ratio that we did not even try to estimate @xmath127 or the higher order contributions to @xmath125 . ) our results for a range of @xmath14 values which span the @xmath12 transition for each quark mass are given in table  [ tab : phase ] .",
    ".fluctuations in the phase of the fermion determinant .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a reasonable measure of how `` well - behaved '' this phase is , is @xmath128 .",
    "when this quantity is close to @xmath129 , the oscillations in phase are small , and it is reasonable to produce ensembles with the magnitude of the determinant and to include the phase in the measurement .",
    "when this expectation value falls towards zero @xmath90 is almost uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath130 $ ] , and the contributions of configurations generated using the magnitude of the determinant can easily cancel , as they would in the denominator of equation [ eqn:<o > ] for this case .",
    "how small @xmath128 can get before generating ensembles without the phase becomes invalid is a matter of `` experimentation '' , but one might expect that @xmath131 would be a reasonable range over which we could use this method . to the order in @xmath0 to which we work we must take @xmath132 . applying our criterion to the measurements of table  [ tab : phase ] , we see that , even in the worst case we should be able to trust the relationship between measurements at finite @xmath0 and finite @xmath2 , out to @xmath133 , i.e. out to @xmath134 .",
    "thus it is not unreasonable to assume that this relation will be a reasonable approximation for most of the region @xmath4 .",
    "let us now examine the nature of these transitions more closely .",
    "we have observed that the transitions appear smooth in all measured observables .",
    "this suggests that they are merely rapid crossovers .",
    "histogramming those observables which could show discontinuities if there were a first order transition , shows a single broad peak for all masses considered for all @xmath4 , which suggests a crossover ( or possibly a second order transition ) but not a first order transition .",
    "we note that on such small lattices , one can observe a double peak structure , even where the transition is a crossover or second order transition .",
    "however , it is rare that a first order transition would not show a double peak , unless it were very weak . in figure",
    "[ fig : hist0 ] we show histograms of the wilson line ( polyakov loop ) for @xmath46 at an intermediate value of @xmath0 ( 0.3 ) and one close to @xmath135 ( 0.55 ) .",
    "these both show a single broad peak as advertised , and are typical .",
    "[ we chose to show the wilson line rather than the chiral condensate , since use of stochastic estimators ( even after averaging over all 5 estimates for each configuration ) could possibly obscure a double peak . ]    finally , we have calculated the fourth order binder cumulants @xmath5 for the chiral condensate at the transition for each @xmath58 and @xmath0 .",
    "having 5 noisy estimators per configuration , we were able to generate an unbiased estimator for @xmath5 .",
    "we again use ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting to interpolate between those @xmath14 values at which we ran our simulations .",
    "we determined the position of the transition for each @xmath58 and @xmath0 as that @xmath14 which minimized @xmath5 .",
    "this method of determining the position of the transition gave @xmath59 values in excellent agreement with those obtained from the maxima of the corresponding susceptibilities .",
    "we plot these @xmath5 values in figure  [ fig : binder0 ] .",
    "if there were a critical endpoint , which is expected to be in the ising universality class , we would expect @xmath5 to pass through its ising value , @xmath136 , at this endpoint .",
    "for the crossover region , @xmath5 should lie above the ising value , approaching @xmath62 in the limit of large lattices . in the first order domain",
    "( if it existed ) @xmath5 should lie below the ising value , approaching @xmath129 in the large lattice limit .",
    "we have plotted the ising value as a dashed line in figure  [ fig : binder0 ] .",
    "clearly @xmath5 lies well above @xmath137 and shows no sign of approaching this value .",
    "hence the evidence from binder cumulants supports our conclusion that the transition is a crossover for all @xmath4 , over a range of quark masses .",
    "in the region where @xmath6 , for @xmath9 , the charged pion condensate evaporates at the finite temperature transition and @xmath7 symmetry , which is broken spontaneously at low temperature , is restored .",
    "hence this finite temperature transition is a true phase transition .",
    "however , since in this case the low temperature phase has a true goldstone mode , this would render the dirac operator singular ( at least in the large volume limit ) .",
    "hence we must use a non - zero @xmath8 , which we keep small so that we can infer information about the @xmath138 limit . for @xmath139 ,",
    "the phase transition is no longer required , and our earlier work indicates that for @xmath0 just above @xmath135 , the transition is softened to a crossover .",
    "we can now search for a critical endpoint in the high @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) regime . again",
    "the critical endpoint would be expected to lie in the universality class of the 3-dimensional ising model . for @xmath0 above this endpoint the transition would be first order .",
    "unfortunately , in this domain , we can not argue that the finite @xmath0 and the finite @xmath2 transitions are related .",

    "the reason @xmath149 was decreased from @xmath150 to @xmath151 close to the transition was that finite @xmath149 effects at @xmath147 , both here and in our @xmath1 runs at the same @xmath0 , can artificially enhance the 2-state signal .",

    "the obvious choice is to look at the binder cumulants of the pion condensate , since this is the order parameter of this transition in the @xmath138 limit .",
    "we plot @xmath5 versus @xmath0 in figure  [ fig : binder_l005 ] obtained using ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting to obtain @xmath5 at that @xmath14 which minimizes @xmath5 for that particular value of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath1 points suggest that the binder cumulant crosses the ising value somewhere above @xmath142 and probably close to @xmath143 .",
    "if so , this would indicate that there is a critical end point with ising critical exponents at @xmath155 with @xmath156 .",
    "for @xmath157 the transition would become first order .",
    "the @xmath144 binder cumulant at @xmath142 is large enough to indicate that @xmath158 is indeed greater than @xmath159 .",
    "we would expect that if the transition is first order for @xmath140 it will also be first order for @xmath9 . hence there will be a tricritical point for @xmath160 where @xmath161 . since @xmath140 is rather small , we expect that @xmath162 .",
    "we have simulated lattice qcd with 2 flavours of staggered quarks ( ` half ' a staggered quark field ) with a chemical potential @xmath0 for isospin ( @xmath7 ) , in the neighbourhood of the finite temperature transition .",
    "for @xmath4 we have determined the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath59 , the transition @xmath15 , for each of 3 quark masses .",
    "we have noted that the fluctuations of the phase of the fermion determinant on an @xmath1 lattice are well enough behaved for small @xmath0 that there should be a range of @xmath0 for which the dependence of @xmath59 , and hence temperature , on @xmath0 and on the quark - number chemical potential @xmath2 should be identical for @xmath3 , as was observed previously by the bielefeld - swansea group for the @xmath97-@xmath98 action @xcite .",
    "what we find is that @xmath59 falls slowly with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this falloff is approximately linear in @xmath79 over the whole @xmath4 region .",
    "the value of @xmath59 at @xmath12 increases with mass and the falloff with increasing @xmath79 becomes less steep as the mass is increased .",
    "this dependence on mass is small .",
    "we have taken the results of de forcrand and philipsen @xcite and converted them from a @xmath2 dependence to a @xmath0 dependence .",
    "since these were calculated at a smaller mass @xmath163 than ours , we can not compare them directly .",
    "we fit the mass dependence of our ` data ' and theirs ( a total of 4 different masses ) to that expected from critical scaling with both the continuum @xmath102 , and lattice @xmath104 universality classes , as was done at zero chemical potential in @xcite .",
    "both these fits prove acceptable .",
    "this is a direct confirmation that the @xmath0 and @xmath2 dependence of the transition temperature are the same , at low chemical potentials .    since the phase of the fermion determinant is an extensive quantity , the fluctuations in this phase increase with volume",
    "this would suggest that the relation between finite @xmath2 and finite @xmath0 transitions would fail as the spatial volume is increased ( the temporal extent is fixed at @xmath164 ) , which is disturbing since the infinite volume limit is of the most physical importance .",
    "we suggest that the relevant phase to consider in establishing this relationship is not that on an arbitrarily large lattice , but is rather the phase on a lattice whose spatial size is of the order of the correlation length",
    ". then we could limit our considerations of phase fluctuations to a modest lattice size , unless we were very close to a critical point .",
    "it is worthwhile quantifying what we mean when we say that the dependence on @xmath0 is slow , and what this means for the physical quantity , temperature .",
    "if we assume that the transition temperature at @xmath165 is @xmath166  mev , then for our @xmath46 simulations , 2-loop running of the coupling would imply that by @xmath55 or in physical units @xmath167  mev ( @xmath168  mev ) , the transition temperature will have fallen to @xmath169  mev .",
    "the relevance of this is even more clear when one considers that this latter @xmath2 value is an order of magnitude larger than those chemical potentials believed accessible by rhic .",
    "the smoothness of the transitions for @xmath4 for all 3 masses , and the absence of any sign of a 2-state signal strongly suggests that there is no critical endpoint , beyond which the transition would become first order , in this domain .",
    "analysis of the 4-th order binder cumulant for each of the transitions , yields values @xmath170 .",
    "since this quantity should pass through the 3-d ising value @xmath171 at a critical endpoint and lie below this value in the first order region , this validates our assumption that the finite temperature transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma remains a crossover throughout this region , and suggests that there is no critical endpoint for the corresponding range of @xmath2 .",
    "we have also studied @xmath6 , where the finite temperature transition for symmetry breaking parameter @xmath9 is a true phase transition from a pion condensed superfluid to a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "here we have performed simulations with a small @xmath8 ( @xmath172 ) , where the second order transition for @xmath0 just above @xmath135 , softens to a crossover .",
    "we see evidence that for @xmath0 sufficiently large ( @xmath173 ) , there is a critical endpoint , where the 4-th order binder cumulant passes through its 3-d ising value , and beyond which it is first order .",
    "this observation needs to be confirmed on larger lattices , where the passage through the critical endpoint is expected be considerably more rapid .",
    "unfortunately , in this regime , we can not argue that a critical endpoint in @xmath0 is in any way related to a corresponding critical endpoint in @xmath2 .",
    "we have recently begun to extend this work to the 3-flavour case .",
    "not only is this more physical , but one can argue that it is possible to tune the critical endpoint to be as close to @xmath12 as one desires , by careful choice of the quark mass @xmath58 .",
    "in particular we can choose the critical value @xmath155 to obey @xmath174 , and lie in the domain where the @xmath2 and @xmath0 transitions are related .",
    "studies of the @xmath62 and @xmath175 flavour transitions by various methods have located such a critical endpoint , but their predictions of its location are not in agreement @xcite .",
    "hence we have a chance to clarify the situation by a more direct approach .",
    "it has been pointed out by de forcrand , kim and takaishi @xcite , that simulating with finite @xmath0 provides a better ensemble for reweighting methods for finite @xmath2 , than simulations with zero chemical potential .",
    "combined with our observations , this suggests that such reweighting would be optimal close to the finite temperature transition for small @xmath2 , and could be expected to give good predictions for observables in this domain .",
    "this should enable us to determine the equation - of - state in this low-@xmath2 domain .",
    "of course , such reweighting requires calculating the phase of the fermion determinant . doing this",
    "precisely would be prohibitively expensive for all but the smallest lattices .",
    "new methods for approximating the fermion determinant show promise for making these reweighting methods practical @xcite .",
