    "@xcite we investigated convex tube domains from the point of view of theory of holomorphically invariant distances .",
    "more precisely , we were interested especially in the notion of complex geodesics . given a convex domain @xmath2 , we call a holomorphic map @xmath8 a _ complex geodesic _ for @xmath6 if there exists a _ left inverse _ of @xmath9 , i.e. a holomorphic function @xmath10 such that @xmath11",
    ". complex geodesics of @xmath6 are exactly holomorphic isometires between the unit disc @xmath12 equipped with the poincar distance and the domain @xmath6 equipped with the carathodory pseudodistance .",
    "it follows from the lempert theorem ( see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) ) that if @xmath2 is a taut convex domain , then for any pair of points in @xmath6 there exists a complex geodesic passing through them .    in this paper we restrict our considerations to convex tube domains containing no complex affine lines ( equivalently , to convex tubes with no real affine lines contained in base ) .",
    "such a family of domains is equal to the family of taut convex tube domains ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this approach has many advantages , among which it is worth mentioning that every holomorphic map with image lying in such a domain admits a boundary measure ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* observation 2.4 ) it follows that doing such a restriction we lose no generality .",
    "this paper may be treated as a continuation of @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we gave an equivalent condition for a holomorphic map @xmath8 to be a complex geodesic in a convex tube domain @xmath6 containing no complex affine lines .",
    "it it stated in language of measure theory and formulated in terms of _ boundary @xmath13-tuple of measures _ of @xmath9 ( in @xcite and here shortly called a _",

    "we derive it using the equivalent condition from @xcite and the following , spherical decomposition of @xmath13-tuples of measures ( lemma [ lem_rozklad_miary_varrho_d_nu ] ) : given real borel measures @xmath17 on @xmath18 , there exist a finite positive borel measure @xmath19 on @xmath18 singular to the lebesgue measure @xmath20 on @xmath18 , a borel - measurable map @xmath21 from @xmath18 to the unit sphere @xmath22 and a map @xmath23 with components in @xmath24 such that @xmath25 the objects @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath26 are in some sense unique .",

    "for example , if @xmath27 is a tuple @xmath49 of real ( i.e. complex with real values ) borel measures on @xmath18 and @xmath50 is a real vector or a bounded borel - measurable mapping from @xmath18 to @xmath39 , then @xmath51 or @xmath52 is the measure @xmath53 , etc .",
    "the fact that a real measure @xmath19 is positive ( resp .",
