    "hydra ii is one of the new faint satellite galaxies of the milky way recently discovered in the southern hemisphere with the dark energy camera @xcite .",
    "the galaxy was found by searching for overdensities in data from the survey of the magellanic stellar history ( smash , * ? ? ?",
    "the discovery of new low - luminosity satellites is of tremendous importance for reconciling observations and lcdm predictions for the number and distribution of satellites around the milky way ( the missing satellite problem , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several of the new galaxies , including hydra ii , have the added aspect of a possible association with the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting scenario ( that needs further investigation ) because cosmological numerical simulations predict that cases of  satellites of satellites \" are common at the time of infall @xcite .",
    "confirmation and full characterization of the new discoveries ( e.g. , establishing them as satellite galaxies rather than globular clusters ) are needed in order to test these theoretical predictions and to understand the role of dwarf systems in the formation of milky way  type galaxies .",
    "key to such characterization is accurate distance measurements toward the new galaxies .",
    "@xcite recently obtained spectroscopy for several stars in hydra ii .",
    "although they could not resolve the velocity dispersion of the system ( the main diagnostic for confirming it as a galaxy ) , the large metallicity dispersion they measured ( @xmath10[fe / h]@xmath11 ) , together with hydra ii s relatively large size ( 68 pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* but see revised value below ) makes it more likely to be a dwarf galaxy rather than a globular cluster .",

    "the detection of rr lyrae stars in low ",
    "luminosity systems is also important for other reasons .",
    "rr lyrae stars are standard candles and thus provide an alternative method for determining the distances to galaxies .",
    "this is particularly critical in these distant and low ",
    "luminosity systems lacking young stellar populations ( i.e. , systems that can not host cepheids , which could also be used as distance indicators ) .",
    "in addition , it is hard to fit isochrones to low luminosity systems because there are very few stars in the upper part of the color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , the contamination by field stars may be important due to the low density of stars in the system , and the main sequence turn ",
    "off may not be available in some systems due to their large distances . in the case of hydra ii , for example",
    ", the distance was estimated by @xcite by identifying 12 probable horizontal branch ( hb ) stars in the galaxy and using the hb absolute magnitude  color relationship of @xcite . if hydra ii contains rr lyrae stars , the distance could be accurately calculated and important parameters such as the physical half  light radius and absolute magnitude refined .",
    "in addition , the comparison of the pulsational properties of rr lyrae in the halo field and in the milky way satellites allows us to study the origin of the field population of rr lyrae stars , and thus the formation of the galactic halo . based on their pulsational properties ,",
    "it has been argued that most of the galactic field rr lyrae stars may have come from a few mergers with sgr  like galaxies @xcite .",
    "the ultra  faint satellites may be an important source to the long - period tail of the period distribution of field rr lyrae stars in the halo , an idea that can be confirmed as more data on low  luminosity galaxies are accumulated .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of other types of variable stars are important for studying the stellar population in a galaxy .",
    "anomalous cepheids ( which are brighter than rr lyrae stars ) are usually interpreted as belonging to metal  poor , intermediate  age population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their progenitors are likely stars with @xmath15 in the he - burning phase , although it has been suggested they can also be the result of binary interaction . the ultra ",
    "faint galaxy leo t , for example , contains 11 such stars @xcite , suggesting a very complex star formation history for this galaxy .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hydra ii is suspected to have a blue straggler population @xcite and some of them may be variable stars of the sx phe type ( see for example * ? ? ?",

    "we explore the ( short  period , @xmath16 day ) variable population of the ultra ",
    "faint dwarf hydra ii and its surroundings .",
    "observations were carried out during 2015 march 3031 with the dark energy camera ( decam , * ? ? ? * ) at the blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , chile .",
    "consecutive observations of hydra ii ( @xmath17 ) were taken during @xmath18 hours both nights , alternating the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters .",
    "because these nights were close to full moon , exposure times were kept relatively short ( 150s ) in order to keep the background flux to manageable levels . even in bright time , this exposure time is good enough to obtain an excellent s / n at the level of the hb of hydra ii ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the typical time separation between observations in the same band was @xmath20 min . during the short period with no moon on these nights we took several continuous , deeper exposures ( 360s ) in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in total we obtained 111 , 112 and 102 observations in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the seeing was stable during the whole observing run at around @xmath21 arcsec .",
    "the galaxy was centered on decam chip s4 at the center of the field of view . the entire galaxy ( @xmath22 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) fits well within a single ccd , which has a fov of @xmath23 .",
    "however , we searched for variables in the full decam fov ( @xmath24 diameter ) to explore for a possible extra - tidal population of variable stars .",
    "images were processed by the decam community pipeline @xcite which performs bias subtraction , flatfielding and astrometric calibration , among other steps .",
    "psf photometry was made using the photred pipeline @xcite which is based on daophot - allstar routines @xcite . to isolate stars from extended objects ,",
    "the final catalog was cleaned by cutting out objects having ( sextractor ) values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "then , using as reference the image with the lowest airmass observation in each band we performed relative photometry by calculating zero - point differences between each individual observation and the reference image . because both nights were photometric , the differences in zero point among the different observations were due only to variations in atmospheric extinction due to the changing airmass of the field during each night .",
    "once the zero point differences were applied to the data , mean magnitudes for each star were calculated .",
    "the resulting catalog was calibrated using these ( instrumental ) mean magnitudes and comparing them with the photometry measured in the discovery paper @xcite .",
    "both zero points and color terms were included in the transformation equations .",
    "the final ensemble contains calibrated @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 time series for 277,579 point sources .",
    "figure  [ fig - error ] shows the standard deviation ( @xmath28 ) of the magnitudes of each star as a function of their mean magnitude .",
    "the main locus observed in each of these figures corresponds to non - variable stars and defines the photometric errors of our observations as a function of magnitude . to characterize the loci we binned the data in 0.2 mag bins and calculated the ( sigma - clipped ) mean error ( @xmath29 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath30 ) in each bin centered on magnitude @xmath31 .",
    "the mean photometric errors of the sample are @xmath32 mags for @xmath33 and increase to 0.1 mags around @xmath34 in each band .",
    "the expected error at the level of the hb of hydra ii is @xmath35 mags .",
    "we consider stars as variables if they are located significantly above the locus of the normal stars ( @xmath36 ) . about @xmath37",
    "( 3,718 stars ) of all stars in the field show variability simultaneously in all three bands .",
    "these variable stars are indicated with crosses in figure  [ fig - error ] .",
    "we proceed to identify periodic variable stars in the dataset by using the well - known phase - dispersion minimization method first described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "to make full use of all the available multi - band data , we combined the results of the lk method in each individual band to derive an enhanced string length parameter ( see for example * ? ? ?",

    "* ) :    @xmath38    where we weight by the number of observations in each band , @xmath39 .    in the original lk method ,",
    "the correct period is obtained by finding the minimum value of the string length parameter ( @xmath40 ) for a range of trial periods in a particular band .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 is the mean squared difference between magnitudes ( @xmath41 ) at consecutive phases for a given trial period :    @xmath42    because our observations contain data from only two nights , the period search was restricted to values less than one day .",
    "our data are not sensitive to long - period variables .",
    "we applied the method in two period ranges , one optimized for rr lyrae stars and anomalous cepheids ( 0.15 to 1.0 days ) , and the other one aimed at finding dwarf cepheid stars ( 0.01 to 0.15 days ) .",
    "we considered several minima of @xmath43 during our search to allow for possible spurious periods due to harmonics or aliases .",
    "after visually examining potential periodic stars given by this method , we finally selected and classified 32 periodic variables in the field .",
    "most of the periodic stars are eclipsing binaries , but we also found six rr lyrae stars and four dwarf cepheids ( one of them is dubious and may be an anomalous cepheid ) .",
    "the rest of the @xmath44 variables are probably due to noise and artifacts ( half of them are fainter than @xmath45 ) , non - periodic variables , or stars with periods @xmath46 day .",
    "table  [ tab - var ] contains coordinates , number of observations in each band , mean magnitudes , amplitude , period and classification for all the periodic variable stars ( see sections 3.1 to 3.3 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a general description of the observational properties of the different types of variables .",
    "we searched the international variable star index ( vsx ) and found that only one star out of the 32 had been previously classified as a periodic variable .",
    "this star is 48.10426 , which has been classified as a rr_ab _ star in the catalina real - time transient survey ( * ? ?",
    "* crts ) , under i d sss_j122306.8 - 322119 , with a period similar to that we have found in this work .",
    "the remaining 31 stars should be considered as new discoveries .",
    "star 48.10426 is the brightest of the rr lyrae stars in our sample .",
    "fainter stars may have been missed by the crts since its completeness starts to decrease at magnitude @xmath47 @xcite .    a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the full decam field",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig - cmdall ] , together with the periodic variable stars found within it .",
    "this cmd was obtained by averaging the multiple individual observations of each star .",
    "as expected , rr lyrae stars and dwarf cepheids ( red circles and magenta squares ) are located in a narrow range of color in this diagram ( @xmath48 , the instability strip ) , while eclipsing binaries are widely spread in color .",
    "figure  [ fig - sky ] shows the location of the variable stars in the field .",
    "the circle in one of the central ccds indicates the location and half - light radius of hydra ii .",
    "only one of the variable stars , an rr lyrae star , lies within the half - light radius of the galaxy .",
    "thus , the rest of the variable stars are likely to be milky way field stars .",

    "if the stars in this group are true ew type , then it is very likely that their periods are double those found by the lk algorithm ( the lk algorithm value is the one reported in table  [ tab - var ] ) because a full period would have two eclipses .",

    "according to @xcite , the period for this star may be on the short side for anomalous cepheids ( although there are stars with periods as short as 0.3 d ) , but still , considering all of its properties ( color , amplitude , period , shape ) , this is the most likely classification .",
    "it is possible that this star is displaying a slight change of period from one night to the other since in the first night it shows a full cycle while in the second night , which spans the same time range , the cycle is not complete .",
