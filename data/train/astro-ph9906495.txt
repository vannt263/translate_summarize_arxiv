    "the formation mechanism of jets and molecular outflows from young stellar objects ( ysos ) and their roles in the star formation process are not well understood observationally or theoretically .",
    "one of the best observational approaches is to investigate very young protostars which are in an evolutional stage just after the onset of the outflow activity .",
    "andr , ward - thompson and barsony ( 1993 ) identified such protostars with sources which have not been detected in the near - infrared and which display a blackbody - like spectral energy distribution ( sed ) which peaks in the submillimeter .",
    "they proposed to classify these objects as class 0 sources , being in a younger evolutional stage than that of class i sources defined by lada ( 1987 ) .",
    "the cold seds of class 0 sources suggest that the bulk of final stellar mass has not yet been accumulated .",
    "class 0 sources are thought to be in their main accretion phase and they are known to have very powerful `` jet - like '' co bipolar molecular outflows which are usually observed with typical sizes of @xmath13pc ( e.g. , bachiller et al .",
    "1991 ; bachiller et al . 1996",
    "; bachiller 1996 ; yu and chernin 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast , the co outflows from class i sources are poorly collimated and much less powerful ( bontemps et  al .",
    "it is believed that the acceleration and collimation of the outflows involve magnetohydrodynamic processes in the vicinity of the central stars ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "for example , the outflows are thought to be centrifugally accelerated from magnetized keplerian disks ( e.g. , uchida and shibata 1985 ; kudoh and shibata 1997 ; pudritz et al .",
    "1991 ) or thought to be accelerated from the interaction regions between the stellar magnetospheres and the surrounding disks ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "1988 ; najita et  al .",
    "millimeter - interferometer observations with small arrays have extensively investigated the kinematics of gas around class 0 sources .",
    "their spatial resolutions , however , were at most arcsecond scale ( corresponding to a 100 au scale in nearby star forming regions ) .",
    "it is essential to attain higher spatial resolution  down to subarcsecond - scales",
    " in order to understand outflows in the vicinity of class 0 sources .",
    "interferometric imaging of the @xmath15o maser line at 22 ghz with the vla and vlba provides an excellent tool for studying subarcsecond structure in protostellar jets very close to protostars .",
    "it has been suggested that the maser lines in low - mass star forming regions are associated with outflows , because the luminosities of the masers correlate with mass - loss rates derived from co molecular observations ( felli et al .",
    "1992 ) and with the luminosities of 6 cm free - free continuum emission from ionized , collimated outflows ( wilking et al .",
    "1994 ; meehan et al .",
    "clear evidence for that was obtained by high spatial resolution studies with the vla - a array ( e.g. , chernin 1995 ) and with the vlba ( e.g. , claussen et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these observations revealed that the masers originate behind the shocked gas very close to the central protostars .",
    "interferometric observations of the maser lines have three advantages .",
    "first , we can attain high angular resolutions ( @xmath31 - 100 mas ) and high relative positional accuracies ( typically @xmath16 of angular resolutions ) .",
    "second , the maser lines are free from extinction even in deeply embedded sources .",
    "third , we can attain high velocity resolution ( @xmath17 ) with radio spectroscopy .",
    "however , such studies have just begun toward the class 0/i sources .",
    "we have found that class 0 sources provide the best targets for studying gas kinematics very close to protostars through observations of the @xmath15o maser lines .",
    "masers have been detected for 18 of 30 class 0 sources ( detection rate is @xmath18 ) in our ongoing multi - epoch survey toward class 0/i sources with the nobeyama 45m - telescope ( furuya et al .",
    "1998 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we measured a detection rate of only @xmath19 10% for class i sources .",
    "this estimate is based upon data compiled from our survey and previous ones ( wouterloot and walmsley 1986 ; wilking and claussen 1987 ; cessaroni et al .",
    "1988 ; comoretto et al .",
    "1990 ; terebey et al .",
    "1992 ; felli et al . 1992 ; palagi et al . 1993 ; xiang and turner 1995 ; claussen et al . 1996 ) , although sensitivities and angular and velocity resolutions differ .",
    "we interpreted this result as follows .",
    "since class 0 sources possess a large amount of circumstellar gas , the gas shocked by outflow can easily reach the physical conditions necessary to excite the maser emission ( @xmath20 with @xmath21 k ; hollenbach 1997 , or @xmath22 with @xmath23 k ; elitzur et al .",
    "in addition to providing appropriate conditions near the outflow origin , edge - on disks could also enhance the detectability of maser emission by maximizing the path length of velocity coherent gas ( elmegreen and morris 1979 ) . in this case",
    ", we could investigate kinematics of protostellar disks using the maser probe as shown by fiebig et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in iras 00338@xmath246312 .    in this paper",
    ", we have studied the 22 ghz @xmath15o maser emission toward the class 0 source s106 fir .",
    "a compact , bipolar hi@xmath25i region lies near s106 fir .",
    "a distance to s106 molecular cloud is 600 pc ( eiroa , els@xmath26sser and lahulla 1979 ; staude et al .",
    "the exciting star s106-irs4 ( other names are s106-irs3 , s106-ir and s106 ps ) whose spectral type is o8v - b0v ( gehrz et al . 1982 ) , is located @xmath2 east of s106 fir .",
    "s106 fir is a class 0 source isolated from this bipolar hi@xmath25i region .",
    "a dense core with a diameter of 9000 au was observed around s106 fir in 450 , 800 and @xmath27 m continuum emission using the jcmt ( richer et al .",
    "1993 ) , while no emission at 20 @xmath28 m was detected ( gehrz et al .",
    "the sed of s106 fir suggests that this source is a class 0 source .",
    "analysis of the sed implies that the luminosity of s106 fir is in the range of @xmath29 to @xmath30 ( richer et al .",
    "it should be noted that a distinct co molecular outflow has not been detected in s106 fir , making it unique among all class 0 sources searched ( hayashi et al . 1993 ; bachiller 1996 ; furuya et al .",
    "1999 ) , although there is a possibility that wing emission from the s106fir outflow may be hidden by broad line emission associated with the hi@xmath25i region .",
    "the peak of the submillimeter core ( see fig . 4 of richer et al .",
    "1993 ) corresponds to the position of the h@xmath31o masers .",
    "the maser emission was first detected by stutzki et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and subsequent observations were made by kawabe ( 1987 ) using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) in 1987 .",
    "he found that the masers have a doubly - peaked spectrum with a velocity coverage of 15 km @xmath32 and that all the maser spots are concentrated within an area of radius @xmath33 ( 180 au ) . at this position ,",
    "no free - free radio continuum emission has been detected ( felli et al . 1984 ; bally et al . 1983 ; hoare et al .",
    "the presence of the @xmath34 masers , dense molecular cloud core and the cold sed indicate that s106 fir may harbor a protostar .",
    "in particular , the absence of distinct co molecular outflows suggests that this protostar is in an extremely early state of star formation .",
    "deep integration synthesis observations of the @xmath34 maser line ( @xmath35 ; @xmath36 22235.077 mhz ) toward s106 fir were performed with the nrao very large array ( vla ) in its a and bna configurations on 1996 october 15 and 1997 january 23 , respectively .",
    "the fwhm of the primary beam was @xmath37 and the system noise temperatures were around 170 k. we observed in the single if - mode using 128 channels with a total bandwidth of 3.125  mhz .",
    "the velocity range covered was @xmath38 with a velocity resolution of @xmath39 at 22.235 ghz ( table [ tbl : vlaobs ] ) .",
    "the phase tracking center in the a configuration observations was located at the position reported in the previous nma measurements ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ; kawabe 1987 ) .",
    "the center in the bna configuration observations was chosen to be at the strongest maser spot in the a configuration observations .",
    "the integration time per visibility was 8 seconds , and the field of view ( fov ) was limited to be @xmath42 by a coherency level of 97 % for the longest baseline .",
    "the continuum source @xmath43 was used as a phase and amplitude calibrator , and was observed for 2 minutes during each 15-minute observing cycle . for the first epoch ,",
    "@xmath43 was also used as a bandpass calibrator by integrating over the run . for the second epoch , 3c454.3",
    "was observed as a bandpass calibrator using 3-minute integration at the beginning and end of the observations .",
    "the flux density scale for the first epoch was established using the continuum source @xmath44 which was not resolved even in the a configuration .",
    "the flux density scale for the second epoch was set by the continuum source 3c286 .",
    "according to the vla list of calibrator sources , the flux densities of @xmath44 and 3c286 at @xmath45 1.3 cm were 1.0 jy and 2.5 jy , respectively , and the accuracy is expected to be better than 30% .",
    "we made maps of the central regions of 128 mas @xmath5 128 mas area in the fov using task imagr in the aips package with a cell size of 0.5 mas .",

    "the absolute position accuracies of the strongest spots were estimated to be about @xmath54 4 mas for the first epoch and @xmath55 14 mas , @xmath56 5 mas for the second epoch , respectively , taking account of the typical baseline error of the array ( @xmath57 ) and the angular separation of the phase calibrator from the source ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "these excellent absolute position accuracies result from the use of the close phase calibrator whose coordinates are known with a very high positional accuracy ( @xmath59 mas ) .    in order to obtain the relative positions of the remaining maser spots to the strongest spots at individual channels and to improve dynamic range of images , we have employed a self - calibration procedure using only the phase of the strongest maser spots .",
    "the typical rms noise levels in the channel maps after the self - calibration were improved to 10.5 mjy beam@xmath9 from 28.5 mjy beam@xmath9 and 9.4 mjy beam@xmath9 from 22.5 mjy beam@xmath9 for the first and second epochs , respectively .",
    "the relative positional accuracies were determined mainly by the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ratio ) , because the bandpass calibration was done within an accuracy of a few degrees across the channels , and because the self - calibration worked very well and the residual systematic errors were very small .",
    "the relative positional error of a point source convolved with a synthesized gaussian beam is given by @xmath60/(s / n ratio ) where @xmath61 is the fwhm of the beam ( reid et al .",
    "1988a ; @xmath62 ) . for the first epoch ,",
    "we use only the data with s / n ratio higher than 7 , resulting in a maximum positional error of 5.6 mas ( 3.4 au ) . for the second epoch data , we take the s / n ratio higher than 16 which gives the same maximum positional error as that of the first epoch .",
    "these relative positional errors are comparable to those of the absolute ones except for @xmath55 14 mas of the second epoch .",
    "we also monitored the masers irregularly in order to investigate the velocity drifts of the maser peaks .",

    "these peak velocity drifts can be clearly seen in figure [ fig : epochvel ] which shows the peak velocities as a function of the observing date .    the important point which we found from figure [ fig : epochvel ]",
    "is that individual peaks seem to have their own constant accelerations along the line of sight . for the blue peaks ,",

    "@xmath95 resolution exceeds the typical line width of the spectral peaks and causes a serious degradation on the definition of maser components ( see @xmath963.4 ) .",

    "next , we will show correspondence of the maser components between the two epochs . the blue a1 , a2 and a3 components on the first epoch are considered to be identical to the blue b1 , b2 and b3 components on the second epoch , respectively , from the following kinematical arguments .",
    "first , each pair shows a similar velocity range over the two epochs .",
    "second , the peak velocity drifts over @xmath3250 days in figure [ fig : h2osp ] strongly suggest the presence of three kinematical components on the blueshifted side ( i.e. , blue 1 , 2 and 3 ) , which move with their own constant accelerations ( figure [ fig : epochvel ] ) . in addition , the red component has a positive acceleration similar to the absolute values of the acceleration of the blue components , although the red component was observed only over the two epochs .",
    "third , the blue components show similar relative proper motions with respect to the red one , as will be shown in @xmath963.5 .",
    "we found an increase in the separations of about 10 mas over the two epochs between the red and three blue components in figure [ fig : velmap ] .",

    "the absolute positions of the phase referenced maser spots in the two epochs were used to bring self - calibrated relative position maps onto an absolute position basis .",

    ".    nevertheless , we can derive relative proper motions from comparison of the relative position maps whose map origins are at the positions of the red spot at @xmath118 for the first epoch and at the red spot at @xmath119 for the second .",
    "this superposition is based on our interpretation that the two red spots are physically identical as described in @xmath120 .",
    "we show a magnified h@xmath31o maser spot map of the blue cluster for the two epochs in figure [ fig : bothmap ] .",
    "dashed - lines with labels denote the identified maser components .",
    "we now find the relative proper motions of the components over the two epochs .",
    "the distances between the red component and the three blue components with labels of 1 , 2 and 3 increased from 71.7 , 73.2 and 83.7 mas to 84.1 , 82.1 and 96.3 mas , over the two epochs , respectively .",
    "the corresponding proper motions are @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 mas for the blue components 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the proper motion derived for the component 3 was above the @xmath124 level , although the other two were at the @xmath125 level .",
    "the directions of the motions are almost parallel to the line connecting the two clusters .",
    "table [ tbl : proper ] summarizes the changes of the separations and the relative proper motions .",
    "the intensity weighted mean of the proper motions of the blue components relative to the red one is @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) per 100 days .",
    "this can be converted to a relative transverse velocity of @xmath128 along the plane of the sky .",
    "we will discuss three possible models for the origin of the two maser clusters : ( 1 ) masers associate with a compact jet - like flow , ( 2 ) masers originate near each star of a binary system , and ( 3 ) masers are generated in tangential parts of a rotating disk .",
    "we conclude that the jet - like flow model will explain our results well .",
    "the elongation of the spatial distributions of the maser spots , the presence of the blue and red cluster of maser spots and the relative proper motions of the maser components along the elongation strongly suggest that the maser emission is excited in an expanding jet - like outflow .",
    "we assume that the driving source of the outflow , a protostar , is located at the middle of the line connecting the two clusters .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the fact that the spectral profiles of the masers have blue- and redshifted symmetric peaks with respect to the ambient cloud velocity which is thought to be the same as the systemic velocity of the central protostar .",
    "we will discuss three - dimensional geometry of the jet - like flow based on our results .",
    "first , we can derive an inclination angle of the outflow out of the plane of the sky from the proper motions and radial velocities of the maser components .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath129 comes from @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a mean peak velocity over the two epochs and @xmath28 is the relative proper motion for each blue component .",
    "we obtained @xmath132 and @xmath133 for the three blueshifted components , respectively ( see table [ tbl : proper ] ) ; we adopt an intensity weighted mean of @xmath134 .",
    "so , the outflow axis of s106 fir is nearly in the plane of the sky .",
    "next , we can estimate an outflow velocity range using both the radial velocities and the relative proper motions .",
    "since symmetric proper motions for the blue and red components are suggested by the symmetric maser spectra with respect to the ambient cloud velocity , the outflow velocity is estimated to be one half of the transverse velocity described in @xmath100 and ranges from 45 to @xmath135 , corrected for the inclination angle ( see table [ tbl : proper ] ) .",
    "this derived velocity range is comparable to that reported by claussen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who measured the proper motions of the h@xmath31o masers in the class i source iras 05413@xmath1360104 .",
    "the escape velocity from the protostar of s106 fir ranges from 10.3 to 20.6 km  s@xmath9 at a distance of 25 au from the protostar , taking the stellar mass to be 1.5 - 6 @xmath137 deduced from the observed bolometric luminosity range ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "hence , the maser spots could not be gravitationally bound to the star : this is consistent with the outflow model .",
    "furthermore , we estimate the acceleration of the outflow from the radial velocity drifts of the maser components ; we assume that the motions of the maser components are limited to lie along the outflow axis .",
    "the resulting acceleration ranges from 4 to 15 @xmath139 corrected for the inclination angle .",
    "we summarize properties of the outflow in table [ tbl : outflow ] .",
    "we will discuss two acceleration mechanisms for the jet - like flow .",
    "the masers could be accelerated by the stellar wind from the assumed protostar , or by stellar radiation .",
    "we conclude that the former mechanism seems most plausible , because the radiation pressure appears insufficient to accelerate the jet - like flow up to the acceleration range estimated in @xmath964.1.1 .",
    "first , we will discuss the mechanism whereby the masers are accelerated by the stellar wind which is commonly thought to accelerate the water masers ( e.g. , genzel et al .",
    "1981 ) . here",
    ", we consider each identified maser component as a spherical maser cloudlet with a radius of @xmath140 mas ( 3au ) , which is a typical size of the identified components described in @xmath963.4 , for simplicity . since the acceleration , @xmath141 ,",
    "is caused by a pressure gradient over the cloudlet , we have @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is a mass density of the cloudlet and @xmath144 is a pressure from the stellar wind . the mass density of the maser cloudlet , @xmath143 is @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the number density of the cloudlet and @xmath147 is the weight of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the wind pressure , @xmath144 at a distance @xmath148 from the protostar is given by @xmath149 , where @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the mass loss rate ( typically @xmath152 ) and wind velocity ( typically @xmath153 ) of protostellar jets , respectively ( e.g. , edwards , ray and mundt 1994 ) .",
    "thus , we obtain the acceleration from stellar winds as follows @xmath154 this value seems to be roughly consistent with the acceleration range of @xmath155 estimated in @xmath156 . here",
    ", we assumed a typical molecular hydrogen density of @xmath157 , necessary to produce maser emission .",
    "if we consider smaller cloudlets , down to maser spot sizes of 1 au ( e.g. , reid and moran 1988b ) , @xmath141 becomes larger .",
    "however this does not have a serious influence on our discussion .",
    "hence , it is probable that the jet - like flow traced by the masers was mainly accelerated by the stellar wind pressure .",
    "next , we will discuss the acceleration , @xmath158 , due to stellar radiation pressure . the acceleration from radiation pressure",
    "is given by @xmath159 .",
    "if we take the bolometric luminosity , @xmath160 to range from 24 to 1000@xmath161 and the mass opacity coefficient , @xmath162 to be @xmath163 ( a typical value in interstellar medium ) , then the acceleration from the radiation pressure ranges from 0.13 to @xmath164 at @xmath165 au from the star . here",
    ", we assume that the maser cloudlets are optically thin .",
    "if we take an optically thick maser cloudlet , @xmath158 becomes smaller compared with the optically thin case .",
    "this estimated range is smaller than the inclination - corrected acceleration of @xmath166 .",
    "hence , it seems unlikely that stellar radiation pressure accelerates the jet - like flow .      in this subsection , we discuss the remaining two models for the origin of the masers .",
    "first , we will discuss a model in which the masers originate near each star of a protobinary system .",
    "recent infrared and optical observations of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars revealed that the frequency of binary systems in pms stars is comparable to that in main sequence stars ( @xmath167 ; e.g. , mathieu 1994 : ghez et al .",
    "1997 : kohler and leinert 1998 : brandner and kohler 1998 ) .",
    "this fact suggests that binarity must be common among protostars .    in the binary model",
    ", the separation of the two maser clusters can be taken as the projected binary separation ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "this separation is near the median separation of binaries ( @xmath16930 au from duquennoy and mayer 1991 ) .",
    "the orbital plane of the binary system is suggested to be perpendicular to the plane of the sky because the proper motions were parallel to the line connecting the two clusters .",
    "this is a suitable configuration for the maser amplification .",
    "we estimate a rotational velocity of the binary stars in the orbit as @xmath170 .",
    "a binary phase @xmath171 measured from the zero projected separation can be estimated from @xmath172 for the individual maser components .",
    "we adopt a mean value of @xmath173 .",
    "the binary model has a serious drawback that the system is not in a gravitationally bound state .",
    "for the binary system to be gravitationally bound , the following large enclosed mass is required .",
    "@xmath174 here , @xmath175 is the half of the binary separation given by @xmath176 au .",
    "this enclosed mass is equivalent to a reduced mass of the system .",
    "however , the mass is considerably larger than the reduced mass of the binary system expected from the bolometric luminosity range . therefore , we reject the protobinary model .",
    "next , we discuss a model of a protostellar disk : a single star is located between the clusters and the masers are excited in tangential parts of a rotating disk around the star .",
    "elmegreen and morris ( 1979 ) originally studied such a model in an ideal case : if there exists enough column density of velocity coherent gas along the line of sight in an edge - on rotating disk , then @xmath34 masers can be emitted in tangential parts of the disk .",
    "the resulting maser spectrum is expected to have a symmetric double - peaked shape with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "the terminal velocity of the spectral peaks corresponds to the rotational velocities of the maser emitting regions of the disk .",
    "water masers originating in disks were found , for the first time , towards the class i protostar iras 00338@xmath246312 with the vla ( fiebig et al .",
    "the maser profile defined a symmetric double - peaked shape with respect to the ambient cloud velocity .",
    "the velocity structure of the maser spots suggests that the @xmath34 masers are associated with an infalling , rotating disk - like envelope whose radius , traced by the masers , ranges from 10 to 30 au .",
    "the disk model is not plausible in case of s106 fir , although the h@xmath31o maser spectra in the source have a symmetric double - peaked shape . in s106 fir ,",
    "the disk plane is suggested to be nearly edge - on as mentioned in the binary model , and we can estimate an enclosed mass of the disk and star in the same way as we did for the binary model .",
    "the estimated enclosed mass is large , on the order of 100@xmath137 , which can not be reconciled with the bolometric luminosity range .",
    "therefore , we reject the disk model .",
    "the presence of the @xmath34 masers and the cold sed suggests that the star formation has just begun in this source .",
    "we stress that no well - developed outflows have been reported in s106 fir ( hayashi et al 1993 and bachiller 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , all of the class 0 sources except s106 fir are known to possess distinct co molecular outflows .",
    "these facts suggest that s106 fir is at an evolutionary state just after the onset of outflow activity and the formation of well - developed co molecular outflows usually observed .",
    "do these masers represent a very early state in the development of an outflow from a protostar ?    we have searched for bipolar molecular outflows using the lines of co _",
    "j_=1 - 0 and @xmath177 _ j_=1 - 0 with the nma and the nro 45m - telescope , respectively",
    ". however , no large - scale molecular outflow has been found ( furuya et al . 1999 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath65 _ j_=1 - 0 observations with the nma and @xmath67 ( _ j , k_)=(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) observations with the vla showed the presence of a dense molecular cloud core around s106 fir with a mass of @xmath178 and a size of 9000 au .",
    "this dense core is expected to supply molecular gas to a large - scale outflow through interaction with a stellar wind or the compact jet - like outflow .",
    "our work is being continued as further studies of the proper motions of the @xmath34 masers with the vlba .",
    "the detailed structure and proper motions of the maser spots will be discussed in a forthcoming paper together with a search for large - scale co outflow with the nma .",
    "a search for the exact position of the central star(s ) by free - free continuum observations will also be attempted .",
    "we propose that the central star would be located at the middle of the two clusters ( @xmath179 , @xmath180 ) .",
    "high angular resolution vla observations of the 22 ghz water maser line were conducted toward the class 0 source s106 fir .",
    "the main findings of this paper are as follows .    1 .   we found two clusters of the @xmath34 maser spots with a separation of 50 au , located at the center of the submillimeter core around the class 0 protostar s106 fir .",
    "the sizes of the clusters are 50 au@xmath55 au .",
    "the western and eastern clusters are @xmath6 blueshifted and @xmath181 redshifted , respectively , with respect to the ambient cloud velocity .",
    "three maser components were identified in the blue and a single one in the red clusters , respectively .",
    "these components are composed of spatially localized maser spots within a 10 mas ( 6 au ) area , and correspond to the major peaks in the overall spectrum of the @xmath34 maser line .",
    "we determined both the relative proper motions and peak velocity drifts of the maser components . the proper motions are along the line connecting the two clusters and are @xmath182 mas year@xmath9 .",
    "all the components showed similar peak velocity drifts with radial accelerations of @xmath183 .",
    "we conclude from our observations that the masers are associated with a highly collimated compact accelerating jet - like flow which could originate from an assumed protostar located at the middle of the line connecting the two clusters .",
    "it is possible that s106 fir is an extremely young protostar in an evolutionary state just after the onset of outflow activity , because of the absence of distinct co molecular outflows .",
