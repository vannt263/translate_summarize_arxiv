    "ngc  288 ( c0050 - 268 ) and ngc  362 ( c0100 - 711 ) form what is perhaps the best - known `` second parameter pair '' of globular clusters ",
    "ngc  362 presenting a very red horizontal branch ( hb ) , and just the opposite occurring in the case of ngc  288 .",
    "given that the two globulars have very similar chemical composition ( shetrone & keane 2000 ) , the question naturally arises : what is ( are ) the reason(s ) for the dramatically different hbs of these two clusters ?",
    "demarque et al . (",
    "1989 ) estimated an age difference amounting to @xmath2  gyr from analysis of the main - sequence turnoffs ( to ) of the two clusters .",
    "interestingly , just such an age difference appeared to be required , according to the authors theoretical hb simulations , to account for the relative hb types of ngc  288 vs. ngc  362 .",
    "hence these authors argued that age is the second parameter for this pair .",
    "however , since that time many other analyses have been published favoring much smaller to age differences between these clusters ( see bellazzini et al .",
    "2001 , hereinafter paper  i , for up - to - date references ) ; in a few cases , the possibility that they might differ in age by less than 1  gyr ( grundahl 1999 ; vandenberg 2000 ) , or even be coeval ( vandenberg & durrell 1990 ; stetson , vandenberg , & bolte 1996 ) , was raised . therefore , in view of the original claims by demarque et al . ( 1989 ) that an age difference as large as 5  gyr is _ needed _ to account for the hb morphologies of this second parameter pair , such recent to age difference estimates would essentially rule out age as the ( sole ) second parameter  at least in the case of ngc  288/ngc  362 .",
    "on the other hand , several theoretical analyses have also been carried out since demarque et al .",
    "( 1989 ) which relaxed significantly the constraints on the age difference that is required to account for this second parameter pair . while lee , demarque , & zinn ( 1988 ) reported an hb morphology - based age difference between ngc  288 and ngc  362 of 5.7 to 7.3  gyr ( cf .",
    "their table  iii ) , lee , demarque , & zinn ( 1994 ) revised these values to the range 34  gyr .",
    "the main reason for this difference lies in the adopted absolute age : while lee et al .",
    "( 1988 ) adopted an age 1819  gyr for ngc  288 , lee et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reduced this value to 14.9  gyr .",
    "in fact , catelan & de freitas pacheco ( 1993 , 1994 ) pointed out that age differences lower than 3  gyr might be consistent with age as the sole second parameter for this pair , provided both clusters are younger than @xmath3  gyr .",
    "in addition , as pointed out by lee et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and catelan & de freitas pacheco ( 1995 ) , age differences based on hb morphology may decrease further when formulations for mass loss on the red giant branch ( rgb ) are employed which imply an increase in overall mass loss with age .",
    "just such a behavior is indeed found in the case of the well - known analytical mass loss formula proposed by reimers ( 1975a , 1975b ) , as first pointed out by fusi pecci & renzini ( 1975 , 1976 ) .",
    "more recently , catelan ( 2000 ) has readdressed the subject of analytical mass loss formulae for red giant stars and their impact upon hb morphology . not only did he point out that reimers ( 1975a , 1975b ) formula still lacks a sufficiently strong empirical basis , but also that there are several other analytical mass loss formulae in the literature that can be equally well justified in terms of the currently available data",
    "importantly , catelan found that each such formula impacts hb morphology in a different way .",
    "hence previous hb morphology - based age difference estimates for second parameter pairs such as ngc  288/ngc  362 may require revision due to the uncertainty in the treatment of mass loss in rgb stars .    motivated by this , and in view of the new results from paper  i for the to age difference between ngc  288 and ngc  362 based on the so - called `` bridge test ''",
    "( @xmath4  gyr ) , we have decided to investigate anew whether age might be considered the ( sole ) second parameter for this pair .    in the next section",
    ", we present the theoretical framework adopted in this analysis .",
    "specifically , in  2.1 we tackle the hb morphology of ngc  362 , while  2.2 is devoted to the ngc  288 case . in  3 , the hb morphology - based age differences implied by application of each of catelan s ( 2000 )",
    "mass loss formulae are provided for two different assumptions on the metallicity of the pair .",
    "comparison with the to age difference estimate in paper  i is provided in  4 , where the possibility that age may be the ( sole ) second parameter for this pair is critically discussed .",
    "we close the paper in  5 by addressing the possible existence of a correlation between the central densities of globular clusters and the mass dispersion on the hb phase .",
    "the basic theoretical framework adopted in this paper ( hb and rgb evolutionary tracks , color transformations , synthetic cmd generation ) is very similar to that used in catelan ( 2000 ) and catelan , ferraro , & rood ( 2001 ) ; we refer the interested reader to those papers and to the references quoted therein for details . in the present study , stellar evolutionary tracks from catelan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and from sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , have been employed .",
    "unless otherwise stated , a main sequence helium abundance @xmath7 was adopted in all cases .    we assume , as a working hypothesis , that age is the second parameter of hb morphology . we also assume , in line with paper i ( see the extensive discussion in  2.1 therein , but also  4 below ) , that ngc  288 and ngc  362 constitute a `` bona fide '' second - parameter pair , thus adopting the same metallicity for the two clusters .",
    "the underlying zero - age hb ( zahb ) mass distribution is approximated by a gaussian deviate ( see catelan et al .",
    "1998 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the instability strip edges are the same as adopted in catelan et al .",
    "`` observational scatter '' was included by means of a suitable analytical representation of the photometric errors from paper  i.    because we are analyzing the `` horizontal '' distribution of hb stars , our derived mean hb mass and dispersion are little affected by the adopted distance moduli , though there is a small dependence on the adopted reddenings .",
    "we use the constraints from paper i , where we derived a relative distance modulus between ngg  288 and ngc  362 of @xmath8 ( where ngc  288 has the slightly larger distance modulus ) .",
    "consistent with these constraints , we adopt for our simulations an identical distance modulus for both ngc  288 and ngc  362 , with the actual value [ @xmath9 for @xmath5 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 chosen to provide a best - fit to the observed zahb level .",
    "for ngc  362 , we use the reddening value of @xmath12  mag as implied by the schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) maps . for ngc  288",
    "we adopt @xmath13  mag [ @xmath14  mag ] , in excellent agreement with harris ( 1996 ) and ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . within the errors , these reddening values are also in reasonable agreement with the relative reddenings inferred from paper  i , namely : @xmath15 .",
    "note that the main results of the present paper , summarized in fig .",
    "7 below , were found to be largely insensitive to the adopted reddening values .",
    "0.15 in        most previous studies of the pair ngc  288/ngc  362 have primarily utilized hb morphology parameters involving the overall numbers of blue , red and variable ( rr lyrae ) hb stars ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , respectively ) . while such parameters can be very useful in some cases , one drawback associated with this approach is that parameters such as @xmath19 ( the `` lee  zinn parameter '' ) tend to completely lose sensitivity to hb morphology variations for very blue ( or very red ) hbs ( e.g. , buonanno 1993 ; fusi pecci et al .",
    "1993 ; buonanno et al .",
    "1997 ; testa et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "for this reason , in the present study we decided to attempt a more comprehensive match between models and observations . besides @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , we have also studied the behavior of the following additional hb morphology parameters :    * @xmath23 : @xmath24 is defined as the number of hb stars _ redder _ than @xmath25  mag , and should not be confused with buonanno s ( 1993 ) @xmath26 parameter which represents the number of _ blue _ hb stars _ bluer _ than @xmath27  mag . in the case of ngc  362 , we find a value @xmath28 for ngc  362 ; * @xmath29 : @xmath30 is defined as the number of _ blue _ hb stars _ redder _ than @xmath31  mag .",
    "we find @xmath32 for ngc  362 ; * @xmath33 : this is simply the mean @xmath34 color of the red hb stars .",
    "we find @xmath35  mag for ngc  362 ; * @xmath36 : this is defined as the difference in mean @xmath37 color between the red hb and the rgb at the same level ( in @xmath18 ) as the red hb . in the case of ngc  362 , we find a value @xmath38  mag .    from the data presented in paper",
    "i for ngc  362 , one also finds @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "to arrive at these figures , we had to deal with a number of ( apparently ) non - variable stars located in the instability strip region of ngc  362 and for which there is no membership information from the tucholke ( 1992 ) proper - motion survey .",
    "as an objective criterion to assign these non - variable stars to either the red or blue hb components , we used the boundary between fundamental ( rrab ) and first - harmonic ( rrc ) pulsators for m3 ( ngc  5272 ) as given by bakos & jurcsik ( 2000 ) , namely : @xmath42  mag . any non - variable hb stars redder than this limit",
    "were assumed to be red hb stars , and vice - versa for the blue hb .",
    "( the number of such stars is quite small , as can be seen from fig .  1",
    ", so that our results are not seriously affected by the adopted procedure . )",
    "the total number of hb stars , after statistically rejecting 10 red hb stars as possible non - members , is @xmath43 for ngc  362 .",
    "once these parameters had been obtained for ngc  362 , extensive grids of synthetic hbs were computed aiming at estimating , by comparison between the observed and predicted hb morphology parameters , the best - fitting values of @xmath44 ( mean mass ) and @xmath45 ( mass dispersion ) .",
    "we carried out computations for two difference metallicities , namely @xmath5 ( corresponding to @xmath1 } \\simeq -1.5 $ ] for @xmath46 = + 0.3 $ ] ) and @xmath6 ( corresponding to @xmath1 } \\simeq -1.2 $ ] for the same @xmath46 $ ] value ; cf .",
    "salaris , chieffi , & straniero 1993 ) .",
    "these two cases could be described as spanning the range in chemical abundances appropriate to the two clusters , particularly in view of the uncertainties involved in absolute measurements of [ fe / h ] ( i.e. , the zinn & west 1984 vs. carretta & gratton 1997 metallicity scale controversy ) .",
    "we note , however , that the traditionally employed @xmath5 case appears likely to represent just a conservative lower limit to the metallicity of ngc  288 and ngc  362 , even in the zinn & west scale .",
    "0.15 in      after inspection of several hundred sets of cmd simulations , we adopt the following parameters as providing the best global fit for ngc  362 in the @xmath5 case , in the canonical scenario :    0.125 in @xmath47 0.125 in    three randomly picked cmd simulations ( out of a pool of 1000 ) for this best - fitting case are provided in fig .  1 ( left column , mid and bottom rows )",

    "the error bars given above were estimated from extensive sets of simulations such as those summarized in fig .  2 and fig .",
    "these two figures contain multiple panels that describe the dependence of the observables described in  2.1.1 upon @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . to obtain fig .  2",
    ", we held @xmath45 fixed at the best - fitting value , and then allowed @xmath44 to vary  and vice - versa for fig .",

    ", the color difference between the rgb and the red hb is given ; in the next panel , the mean color of the red hb is provided ; in the third panel from the top , both @xmath24 and @xmath30 are shown ; in the bottom panel , the behavior of the usual @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath17 number counts is displayed . in all panels , the observed value for ngc  362 is indicated by a horizontal line .",
    "0.15 in      following the same procedure as in the previous subsection  whose details we omit for conciseness  but assuming a higher metallicity for ngc  362 ( @xmath6 ) , we arrive at the following parameters for the best - fitting gaussian mass deviate :    0.125 in @xmath48 0.125 in    we note , at this point , that the `` color hb morphology parameters '' were not used to rule out any single ( @xmath44 ,  @xmath45 ) combination ; rather , their inclusion in the analysis was intended primarily as a check of whether the colors of the models were in reasonable agreement with the observations . note , in particular , that stars that arrive at the rgb phase with a higher mass are expected to be bluer than lower - mass giants , implying that @xmath36 depends on the assumed rgb tip age .",
    "the @xmath36 values reported in fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 were obtained from rgb tracks which imply an rgb tip age of about 14.5  gyr . from the vandenberg",
    "( 2000 ) models , one estimates a dependence of rgb color on age going as @xmath49  mag / gyr .",
    "this implies that the computed @xmath36 values , as given in fig .  2 and fig .  3",
    ", would be in better agreement with the observed values in case the assumed age were lowered by @xmath50  gyr  which still gives a reasonable absolute age for ngc  362 .",
    "all in all , the colors predicted by the present simulations appear to be in good agreement with the observations at the @xmath51  mag level , both for ngc  288 and ngc  362 .",
    "0.15 in        as was the case with ngc  362 (  2.1 ) , we have computed extensive cmd simulations aiming at matching the observed hb morphology of ngc  288 . besides @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath52 ,",
    "we have also made an effort to reproduce the following additional hb morphology parameters :    * @xmath53 : we compute the mean @xmath18 magnitude of the 10% brightest blue hb stars ( i.e. , those close to the `` horizontal '' level of the hb ) and subtract this from the mean @xmath18 magnitude of the 10% faintest blue hb stars ( i.e. , those located on the blue tail extension of the hb)the resulting quantity is @xmath53 .",
    "this is obviously intended to provide a quantitative measurement of the length of the blue hb tail . in the case of ngc  288",
    ", we find a value @xmath54  mag , not taking into account the three possible `` extreme '' hb ( ehb ) stars discussed in paper  i and which are much fainter than the bulk of the cluster s blue hb population ; * @xmath55 : @xmath56 represents the number of _ blue _ hb stars redder than @xmath57  mag .",
    "this hb morphology indicator was chosen because , from the comparison between theoretical zahb models and the unreddened ngc  288 hb distribution , there appears to be a predominance of brighter - than - expected blue hb stars at the red end of the blue hb ( see fig .  4 , top row",
    "; vandenberg 2000 , particularly his fig .",
    "we find @xmath58 for ngc  288 ; * @xmath59 : this is simply the mean @xmath37 color of the blue hb stars .",
    "neglecting the three candidate ehb stars discussed in paper  i , we find @xmath60  mag for ngc  288 .",
    "note also that , from the data presented in paper  i , the traditional number count parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are found to be 0.98 , 0.02 , and 0 , respectively . utilizing the above reddening value we find , after ignoring the aforementioned ehb candidates , a value @xmath61 for ngc  288 .    the total number of hb stars in ngc  288 , including the 3 candidate ehb stars , is @xmath62 . in the simulations ,",
    "this number was adopted , but the total number of stars in each synthetic hb model was allowed to fluctuate according to the poisson distribution .",
    "once these parameters had been obtained , extensive grids of synthetic hbs were computed in order to estimate the best - fitting @xmath44 and @xmath45 for ngc  288 . as in the case of ngc  362",
    ", we carried out computations for two different metallicities , namely @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "as already noted , these two cases may be roughly considered representative of the zinn & west ( 1984 ) and carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) scales , respectively .",
    "0.15 in      proceeding in the same manner already described for ngc  362 in  2.1 , we arrived at the following best - fitting parameters for ngc  288 , in the more metal - poor case :    0.125 in @xmath63 0.125 in    three randomly picked cmd simulations ( out of a pool of 1000 ) for this best - fitting case are provided in the middle and bottom left panels of fig .  4 , which is analogous to fig .  1 for ngc  288 .",
    "again in analogy with the analysis presented in  2.1 for ngc  362 , the error bars in the derived values of @xmath64 and @xmath45 for ngc  288 were obtained from extensive sets of panels similar to those depicted in fig .  5 and fig .  6 , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the newly introduced @xmath53 parameter strongly constrains both the mean zahb mass and the dispersion around this mean value .",
    "it is interesting to check these simulation results in more detail in order to determine whether the candidate ehb stars discussed in bellazzini & messineo ( 1999 ) and in paper  i may be a `` natural '' occurrence in this type of model . among the pool of 1000 simulations for the best - fitting ( @xmath44 ,  @xmath45 ) combination , we find that only seven synthetic hbs contain ehb stars  where we define as an ehb star any star hotter than @xmath65  k. moreover , only one ehb star was present in each of these seven synthetic cmds .",
    "0.15 in      following the same procedure as in the previous subsection , but adopting a higher metallicity for ngc  288 ( @xmath6 ) , we arrive at the following best - fitting ( canonical ) solution :    0.125 in @xmath66 0.125 in    a random sample of three simulations for this best - fitting combination of parameters is also displayed in fig .",
    "4 ( right column , middle and bottom panels ) .",
    "the upper regions of the observed cmd of ngc  288 ( from paper  i ) are also given in the top right panel ; the distance modulus employed was inferred in the same way as previously described for @xmath5 .",
    "the zahb and tahb loci for @xmath6 are overplotted .",
    "the reported errors are based on analysis entirely analogous to that described in the previous subsection for the @xmath5 case .    as far as ehb stars are concerned , we find that the situation does not change much with respect to the results obtained in the previous subsection for @xmath5 . in particular , among the pool of 1000 simulations for the best - fitting ( @xmath44 ,  @xmath45 ) combination ,",
    "only ten cmd simulations contain ehb stars ( again with a single ehb star present per model ) .",
    "it thus appears that if the three candidate ehb stars in ngc  288 turn out to be bona - fide cluster members , they must be explained by a process different from the one that generated the bulk of the hb population of the cluster  which is perhaps not surprising , particularly in view of the fact that these ehb stars are much fainter than the bulk of the blue hb population of the cluster .    to close this section",
    ", we note that the dispersion in hb mass that we find for ngc  288 is clearly smaller than for ngc  362 .",
    "we suggest that this difference may be related to the higher core density in ngc  362 .",
    "interestingly , catelan et al . ( 2001 ) found that the loose , outer - halo globular cluster palomar  3 is characterized by an even smaller dispersion in hb mass than we found here for ngc  288 .",
    "we will come back to this subject in  5 .",
    "0.15 in      figure  4 reveals a rather satisfactory agreement between the models and the observations of ngc  288 .",
    "however , there is a noticeable discrepancy at the redder part of the blue hb [ @xmath67 where the observed number of stars brighter than the zahb is significantly larger than in the models ( see also vandenberg 2000 ) .",
    "hereafter , we shall call these `` anomalous red blue hb '' ( arbhb ) stars .",
    "the extent to which these stars are brighter than the zahb depends somewhat on the adopted reddening , as can also be seen from figs .",
    "28a , b of vandenberg ( 2000 ) .",
    ", following the notation of paper  i ) between ngc  288 and ngc  362 derived from fits of the data to theoretical zahbs : experiments utilizing the reddening values from harris ( 1996 ) , schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) clearly indicate that the @xmath68 value obtained by the zahb - fitting procedure is uncertain by @xmath69  mag .",
    "we emphasize that the purpose of the present study is _ not _ to derive @xmath68 through zahb - fitting , but instead to analyze the `` horizontal '' distribution of stars along the hbs of ngc  288 and ngc  362 . ]",
    "as far as the apparent overluminosity of these arbhb stars is concerned , we suggest that the best approach to reliably study this phenomenon is through analysis of spectroscopic gravities and ultraviolet photometry@xmath70 photometry providing an interesting first indication that a problem may exist , but being clearly inadequate to examine the phenomenon in sufficient detail .    in fact , there is some evidence that arbhb stars may be present in several other globular clusters ( see also markov , spassova , & baev 2001 ) .",
    "this is suggested , in particular , by the @xmath71 , @xmath72 diagrams for blue - hb clusters in fig .  1 of grundahl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) : in the cases of ngc  288 , m12 ( ngc  6218 ) , m13 ( ngc  6205 ) , ngc  6752 , ngc  6397 , and m56 ( ngc  6779 ) , the redder of the blue hb stars seem brighter than the zahb at the observed colors .",
    "lee & carney ( 1999 , see appendix  a in their paper ) have discussed what appears to be another instance of the same effect , this time at the rr lyrae level of the blue - hb cluster m2 ( ngc  7089 ) . in this sense , it is possible that the arbhb star phenomenon is related to the long - standing difficulties in accounting for the large number of ( _ presumably _ `` evolved '' ) rr lyrae stars in metal - poor , oosterhoff type ii globular clusters with intermediate - blue hbs , such as m15 ( ngc  7078 ; see , e.g. , renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ; rood & crocker 1989 ) .",
    "thus , a resolution of the arbhb stars problem may have ( potentially ) far - reaching implications .",
    "at least in a qualitative sense , some of these `` evolved '' stars might be ( partly ) accounted for if the mass distribution were actually bimodal ( or if the zahb mass distribution contained a cutoff at the red end ; see also appendix  a in lee & carney 1999 ) and/or if the duration of the late stages of the evolution of hb stars has been somewhat underestimated in extant evolutionary computations .",
    "one possible cause for the latter could be the very uncertain @xmath73 reaction rate , which constitutes the dominant source of energy towards the end of hb evolution ( e.g. , imbriani et al . 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "however , renzini & fusi pecci ( 1988 ) and dorman ( 1992 ) have pointed out that a change in the rates of this reaction by a factor of three would change the hb lifetime by only about 10% ( see also brocato , castellani , & villante 1998 ) . another well - known source of uncertainty in the computed duration of the hb evolutionary phase",
    "is the treatment of semiconvection and `` breathing pulses '' ( e.g. , bressan , bertelli , & chiosi 1986 ; caloi & mazzitelli 1993 ; imbriani et al .",
    "a detailed analysis of the problem of arbhb stars is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be deferred to a future occasion .",
    "it is important to note , in any case , that the number of arbhb stars in ngc  288 is relatively small  less than one fifth of the cluster s hb population  so that the main results of our analysis should not be substantially affected by our difficulties in accounting for these stars , particularly if a solution to the problem can be found within the canonical framework . on the other hand , our results _",
    "could _ be significantly affected , if the arbhb stars point to some non - canonical effect affecting _ the bulk _ of ngc  288 s blue hb stars .",
    "this is obviously a consequence of the fact that the present simulations are entirely based on _ canonical _ models .",
    "in order to estimate the differential ages required to produce the relative hb types of ngc  288 and ngc  362 , we follow the same approach described in catelan ( 2000 ) and catelan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in the cases of m5 vs. palomar  4/eridanus and m3 vs. palomar  3 , respectively . as in those papers",
    ", we shall evaluate the effects of an age - dependent mass loss on the rgb , as implied by the several different analytical formulae discussed in the appendix to catelan s paper .",
    "as discussed by catelan , at the present time it does not appear possible to strongly argue in favor of any of his recalibrated equations over the others , so that a safer approach is to use all of them simultaneously whenever an estimate of the amount of mass loss on the rgb is needed .",
    "we briefly recall that equations  ( a1 ) through ( a4 ) of catelan are `` generalized , '' empirically recalibrated variations of the analytical mass loss formulae previously suggested by reimers ( 1975a , 1975b ) , mullan ( 1978 ) , goldberg ( 1979 ) , and judge & stencel ( 1991 ) , respectively .",

    "( the results are qualitatively similar for the other employed mass loss formulae , and are omitted for conciseness . ) besides the absolute hb morphology ages for ngc  288 and ngc  362 ( columns 2 and 3 ; the implied age differences are given in column 8) , the corresponding rgb tip masses when mass loss is ignored ( @xmath75 ) and overall amount of mass loss on the rgb ( @xmath76 ) , both in solar units , are also given ( columns 4,5 and 6,7 , respectively ) . for reference purposes , the implied hb morphology age of the `` inner halo globular clusters '' ( ihgcs ) isochrone ( see catelan & de freitas pacheco 1993 ) at the same metallicity is given in the first column .    in the next section",
    ", we discuss the important implications of fig .  7 for our understanding of the second parameter effect .",
    "as reviewed in  1 , previous theoretical analyses of the hb morphologies of ngc  288 and ngc  362 have required fairly large age differences , generally in excess of 3  gyr , to account for this second parameter pair entirely in terms of age .",
    "this is not the case in the present study : for the first time , we are clearly successful at providing a satisfactory description of the ngc  288/ngc  362 pair under the assumption that age is the sole second parameter .",
    "however , this conclusion does depend on certain conditions .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "7 ( upper panel ) , if we assume a `` canonical '' metallicity @xmath77 for this pair , as has been done in all previous theoretical analyses ( lee et al .",
    "1988 , 1994 ; catelan & de freitas pacheco 1994 ) , one still finds some difficulty in accounting for the observed second parameter effect entirely in terms of age .",
    "in particular , relative ages smaller than 2  gyr do seem to require an absolute ngc  288 age smaller than @xmath78  gyr . as indicated in fig .",
    "7 , age differences smaller than 2  gyr are certainly within the allowed range of the study presented in paper  i ; moreover , as we have previously discussed (  1 ) , some authors still favor an age difference of 1  gyr ( or less ) for this pair . whether absolute ages as low as about 10  gyr are acceptable is , of course , a matter of serious debate ( see , e.g. , grundahl et al . 2000 for a recent discussion ) .",
    "it is only when a higher metallicity is assumed for the ngc  288/ngc  362 pair that one can seriously argue that a solution to the second parameter problem , in the case of this classical second - parameter pair at least , may have been found .",
    "it is quite evident from fig .  7 ( bottom panel ) that , for a metallicity @xmath6 , turnoff age differences as high as 3  gyr can comfortably account for the difference in hb types between ngc  288 and ngc  362 : absolute ngc  288 ages as high as 16  gyr are still consistent with the `` age as the second parameter '' hypothesis",
    "importantly , one also finds that age differences in the @xmath79  gyr range can be accommodated , for such a higher @xmath80 , assuming absolute ngc  288 ages in the @xmath81  gyr range .",
    "again , we emphasize that this result was not present in previous investigations simply because a substantially lower metal abundance had been adopted in all such analyses . on the other hand ,",
    "it had been anticipated many times in the literature that an increase in the metallicity would lead to a larger sensitivity of the temperature of hb stars to small changes in mass ( see , for example , buonanno , corsi , & fusi pecci 1985 , in particular their fig .",
    "6 ) , thus alleviating the second parameter problem .",
    "analysis of table  1 discloses that , while the effect of metallicity on rgb mass loss also contributes to decreasing the hb morphology age difference for a given absolute age , the chief cause of a decrease in such relative ages is the difference in hb mass derived from the synthetic hbs (  2 ) .    since a higher metallicity appears to be highly favorable to the hypothesis that age is the second parameter of hb morphology for the ngc  288/ngc  362 pair , it is clearly of the utmost importance that the existing discrepancies between the zinn & west ( 1984 ) and carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) metallicity scales be resolved .",
    "as well known , at such relatively high metallicities , the latter scale favors significantly higher [ fe / h ] values than found in the more traditional zinn & west scale ; it thus follows that the carretta & gratton scale is also more favorable to the `` age as the second parameter '' hypothesis than is the zinn & west scale .",
    "interestingly , however , the possibility that the high - resolution spectroscopy scale of carretta & gratton may overestimate the globular cluster metallicity , and perhaps be more similar to the zinn & west scale than had previously been realized , has recently been addressed by bragaglia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and frogel ( 2001 ) . in any case",
    ", it is important to note that the @xmath5 case is likely to provide just a conservative lower limit to the actual metallicity of the pair ngc  288/ngc  362 , even in the zinn & west scale .",
    "an equally conservative upper limit to the clusters metallicities , in the carretta & gratton scale , would clearly correspond to @xmath82 .",
    "it is instructive to compare our derived difference in hb mass between ngc  362 and ngc  288 with those from previous analyses of this pair . while lee et al .",
    "( 1988 ) report a difference in @xmath64 of @xmath83 between ngc  362 and ngc  288 , this value was later revised by lee et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to @xmath84 .",
    "note that these authors assumed @xmath5 for ngc  362 , but an even lower metallicity , @xmath85 , for ngc  288 ; had they assumed the same @xmath80 for the two clusters , their derived hb mass difference would have been accordingly higher ( compare the @xmath64 values derived for ngc  288 in  2.2.2 and  2.2.3 ) .",
    "indeed , assuming the same @xmath5 for the two globulars , catelan & de freitas pacheco ( 1994 ) estimated a difference in mean hb mass of @xmath86 .",
    "the present , more comprehensive hb morphology analysis , on the other hand , favors a smaller mass difference , namely : @xmath87 ( @xmath5 ) or @xmath88 ( @xmath6 ) ; but note that a slightly larger difference in mean hb mass",
    "( by @xmath89 ) _ would _ have been found had we , as usually done , relied solely on the traditional number count parameters @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath17 ( see the lower panel of fig .  5 )",
    "such a decrease in the differential hb mass estimate , along with the fact that the mass loss on the rgb has been assumed , in line with catelan s ( 2000 ) prescriptions , to increase with age , explains the different conclusions reached in this paper in comparison with previous ones .",
    "we emphasize that while age may be the explanation for the difference in hb populations of these two clusters , this explanation is not without difficulty . in particular , we confirm a previous suggestion ( vandenberg 2000 ) that canonical models are unable to reproduce the detailed hb morphology of ngc  288 at its red end , giving rise to the `` arbhb '' stars , for as yet unknown reasons .",
    "there is evidence that arbhb stars may be present in several other blue - hb clusters , and the phenomenon may also be related to well - known ( but often overlooked ) problems encountered in the modelling of the rr lyrae variables in oosterhoff type ii globulars which do not have extremely blue hbs , such as m15 ( see  2.2.4 ) . whether this will simply require some tweaking of the current hb evolution ingredients ( e.g. , reaction rates , treatment of semiconvection and `` breathing pulses '' ) within the canonical framework , or instead require a much more drastic rupture of the canonical scenario , is still unclear .",
    "another problem that the current evolutionary models seem to face , at least in the cases of ngc  362 and ngc  1851 , concerns the reproduction of the detailed morphology of the red clump . as can be seen by careful inspection of fig .  1",
    ", the simulations show a gentle slope at the red end of the red hb which is not obvious in the data .",
    "judging from the zahb fits presented in his figs .  28c , d",
    ", the same problem is present also in the case of vandenberg s ( 2000 ) analysis .",
    "one possible explanation , in analogy with dorman , vandenberg , & laskarides ( 1989 ) , is that ngc  362 and ngc  1851 have a somewhat higher helium abundance than assumed in the present model computations  which employ the traditional @xmath7 value .",
    "we have utilized the sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) hb tracks for various helium abundances and a metallicity @xmath6 in an examination of this problem , and found that a @xmath90 would provide a better match between the data and the models , as far as the slope of the red end of the red hb is concerned .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to apply a similar test in the case of ngc  288 , given its exclusively blue hb .",
    "a higher helium abundance in ngc  362 than in ngc  288 would go in the opposite sense to that needed to reproduce the difference in hb types between these clusters . while an application of iben s ( 1968 ) `` @xmath17-method '' to the datasets presented in paper  i does not disclose an obvious difference in the clusters helium abundances  we find , following the buzzoni et al .",
    "( 1983 ) definition , @xmath91 for ngc  288 , implying @xmath92 ; and @xmath93 for ngc  362 , giving @xmath94the uncertainties in the helium abundance thus derived remain sufficiently large that neither the possibility of a higher @xmath95 , nor that of a difference in helium abundance , can be conclusively ruled out .",
    "hb simulations similar to those presented in  2 for @xmath6 but assuming a higher helium abundance @xmath96 for both clusters give a difference in mean hb mass of @xmath97 between ngc  362 and ngc  288which is somewhat larger than the corresponding value ( @xmath98 ) for @xmath7 .",
    "even though the mass difference for the higher-@xmath95 case can not be converted into an hb morphology - based age difference at this point ( due to the lack of sufficiently extensive grids of rgb tracks and isochrones for non - canonical helium abundances ) , the present exercise should suffice to show that the uncertainty in the hb morphology - based age difference between ngc  288 and ngc  362 stemming from a possible systematic uncertainty in the helium abundance is of the same order of the uncertainty in the metallicity scale discussed previously .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the assumption of identical heavy - element abundances for ngc  288 and ngc  362 may not necessarily be valid .",
    "in particular , shetrone & keane ( 2000 ) suggest that there may be ab initio differences , particularly in the ca and o abundances , between these two clusters : ngc  288 stars may be overabundant in these elements by about 0.10.15  dex compared to ngc  362.}$ ] between ngc  288 and ngc  362 .",
    "in addition , the oxygen abundance derived from atomic lines may depend upon the assumed carbon abundance , which determines the fraction of oxygen found in the co molecule ( e.g. , milone et al . 1992 ; melndez , barbuy , & spite 2001 ) . ]",
    "note that the sense of the difference goes _ against _ that needed to explain the difference in hb morphology between these two clusters . on the other hand , there is also an indication that ngc  288 may be more deficient in iron than ngc  362 , by about 0.06  dex  which would compensate ( at least in part ) the effects of the suggested ca and o abundance differences upon the clusters hb morphologies , and thereby on the inferred hb morphology - based age difference .",
    "it should also be noted , in line with catelan ( 2000 ) , that the treatment of mass loss on the rgb using analytical mass loss formulae , a procedure upon which the present results depend , may not be entirely appropriate ( see also willson 2000 ) .",
    "our knowledge of mass loss in low - mass , low - metallicity red giants is  at best  at a rudimentary stage .",
    "one particularly tantalizing , if speculative , possibility is that the correlation between stellar rotation rates in blue hb stars and hb morphology also implies a correlation between rgb mass loss and rotation ; this could help explain peterson s ( 1985 ) observation that blue hb stars in ngc  288 rotate faster than in ( more metal - poor ) clusters with much redder hbs , such as m3 , m4 ( ngc  6121 ) , and m5 . on the other hand , shetrone & keane ( 2000 )",
    "have recently conducted a study of spectroscopic mass loss indicators in ngc  288 and ngc  362 , and suggested that rgb stars in these two clusters have very similar mass loss rates .",
    "if true , this would rule out the correlation between stellar rotation and rgb mass loss rates as a viable hypothesis to account for ( part of ) the second - parameter problem in the case of this pair . in our opinion , however , the shetrone & keane results are far from being conclusive . in particular , their sample is still inadequate to study differences in mass loss rates between giants in the two clusters .",
    "this is evident from fig .  5 in their paper , where one clearly finds that the vast majority of their brighter studied stars are members of ngc  362 , whereas the ngc  288 sample is much fainter .",
    "therefore , the regime where more extreme mass loss might be expected for ngc  288 was simply not covered in the shetrone & keane investigation , and the question whether ngc  288 giants may lose more or less mass than ngc  362 giants close to the tip of the rgb remains open .",
    "last , but not least , it should be noted that the cause of the bimodal hb of ngc  1851 is currently unknown , but seems unlikely to be due to an intrinsic age spread ( see  3.2 in paper  i ) .",
    "therefore , while age may be the second parameter in the case of ngc  288/ngc  362 , an additional second parameter seems to be required to fully explain the hb morphologies of ngc  1851/ngc  288/ngc  362 . whether this will eventually require a change in the relative turnoff ages estimated in paper  i or",
    "not remains unclear at the present time .",
    "another important result of our analysis is that ngc  362 s hb appears to have a much wider dispersion in mass than is the case for ngc  288 .",
    "we propose that there is a correlation between the central density of globular clusters and mass dispersion on the hb , which is presumably related to the way a dense environment is able to affect mass loss on the rgb ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "1993 ; buonanno et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ; testa et al .",
    "whereas ngc  362 is a very dense cluster ( @xmath99 ; harris 1996 ) with a possibly collapsed core ( e.g. , trager , djorgovski , & king 1993 ) , ngc  288 is very loose ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) .",
    "hence while it is unlikely that the ngc  288 blue hb population should have its origin attributed to environmental effects , the same can not be said with any degree of confidence about ngc  362 .",
    "in other words , if ngc  362 had the same structural parameters as ngc  288 , one might plausibly expect it to have an even redder hb , perhaps completely devoid of blue hb and rr lyrae stars .",
    "another possible hint that the hb morphology of ngc  362 is affected by its high central density are the 14 blue stars detected within the inner @xmath102 of ngc  362 using ultraviolet imagery from uit and wfpc2 ( dorman et al .",
    "unfortunately , it is not yet known whether these are true hb stars or extreme blue stragglers ( which are known to show a strong radial dependence ) .",
    "the same idea may be applicable to the case of ngc  1851 , a cluster whose bimodal hb _ may _ be compatible with a unimodal hb mass distribution , provided the mass dispersion on the zahb is very large ",
    ", substantially larger than found here for ngc  362 ( catelan et al .",
    "1998 ) . indeed",
    ", ngc  1851 appears to have the same age as ngc  362 ( paper  i and references therein ) , but it also has a more sizeable fraction of blue hb and rr lyrae stars .",
    "importantly , ngc  1851 is even denser than ngc  362 , with @xmath103 .",
    "note also that , consistent with this trend , the extremely loose outer - halo cluster palomar  3 has an even smaller dispersion in mass on the hb than ngc  288 ( catelan et al . 2001 )",
    ". a systematic study of a larger sample of globulars would be useful to determine the extent to which this interesting correlation holds .    in conclusion ,",
    "we note that , if central concentration is indeed _ a _ second parameter ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "1993 ; buonanno et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ; testa et al .",
    "2001 ) , driving the _ mass loss dispersion _ ( @xmath45 ) , its interplay with the effects of second parameters acting on the _ mean zahb mass _ ( @xmath64 ) , i.e. age , metal content , etc .",
    ", may significantly contribute to the puzzling variety of hb morphologies actually observed in the galactic globular clusters system .",
    "since we still lack a detailed description of how dense stellar media might contribute to the occurrence of increased mass loss and thus to a bluer hb morphology , we are accordingly unable to take into due account the possible effects of the tremendous difference in central concentration between ngc  288 and ngc  362 in our age difference analysis . a deeper understanding of mass loss processes in red giant stars is badly needed in order for analyses like the one we have carried out in the present paper to be placed on a firmer footing , and for a _ conclusive _ answer to the second parameter problem to be provided .",
