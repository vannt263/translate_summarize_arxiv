    "the quest for exact wormhole solutions in general relativity , which are handles in the spacetime topology , has appeared repeatedly in theoretical physics within different subjects , ranging from the attempt of describing physics as pure geometry , as in the ancient einstein - rosen bridge model of a particle @xcite , to the concept of _ charge without charge \" _",
    "@xcite , as well as in several issues concerning the euclidean approach to quantum gravity ( see , e.g. , gibbons hawking ) . more recently , during the 80 s , motivated by the possibility of quick interstellar travel , morris , thorne and yurtsever pushed forward the study of wormholes from the point of view of reverse engineering \" , i.e. , devising a suitable geometry that allows this possibility , and making use of the einstein field equations in order to find the corresponding stress - energy tensor that supports it as an exact solution @xcite . however , one of the obstacles to circumvent , for practical affairs , is the need of exotic forms of matter , since it is known that the required stress - energy tensor does not satisfy the standard energy conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . besides , the pursuit of a consistent framework for a unifying theory of matter and interactions has led to a consensus in the high energy community that it should be formulated in dimensions higher than four .",
    "however , for general relativity in higher dimensions , the obstacle aforementioned concerning the stress - energy tensor persists . nonetheless , in higher dimensions , the straightforward dimensional continuation of einstein s theory is not the only option to describe gravity .",
    "indeed , even from a conservative point of view , and following the same basic principles of general relativity , the most general theory of gravity in higher dimensions that leads to second order field equations for the metric is described by the lovelock action @xcite , which is nonlinear in the curvature . in this vein , for the simplest extension , being quadratic in the curvature , it has been found that the so - called einstein - gauss - bonnet theory , admits wormhole solutions that would not violate the weak energy condition provided the gauss - bonnet coupling constant is negative and bounded according to the shape of the solution bhawal - kar .",
    "here it is shown that in five dimensions , allowing a cosmological ( volume ) term in the einstein - gauss - bonnet action , and choosing the coupling constant of the quadratic term such that the theory admits a single anti - de sitter ( ads ) vacuum , allows the existence of an exact static wormhole solution in vacuum .",
    "as explained below , the solution turns out to have mass without mass \" and connects two asymptotically locally ads spacetimes each with a geometry at the boundary that is not spherically symmetric .",
    "it is worth to remark that no energy conditions can be violated since the whole spacetime is devoid of any kind of stress - energy tensor . in what follows ,",
    "the five - dimensional case is worked out in detail , and next we explain how the results extend to higher odd dimensions for a special class of theories among the lovelock class , which are also selected by demanding the existence of a unique ads vacuum .",
    "the action for the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory with a volume term can be written as@xmath2where @xmath3 is the curvature @xmath4-form for the spin connection @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the vielbein .",
    "the coupling of the gauss - bonnet term has been fixed so that the theory possesses a unique ads vacuum of radius @xmath7 . in the absence of torsion",
    ", the field equations can be simply written as@xmath8where @xmath9 .",
    "these equations are solved by the following metric@xmath10 \\ ! ,   \\label{metric}\\]]where @xmath11 is an integration constant and @xmath12 stands for the metric of the base manifold which can be chosen to be locally of the form @xmath13 .",
    "the radius of the hyperbolic manifold @xmath14 turns out to be @xmath15 , so that the ricci scalar of @xmath16 has the value of @xmath17 , as required by the field equations .",
    "the metric ( metric ) describes a static wormhole with a neck of radius @xmath7 , located at the minimum of the warp factor of the base manifold , at @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath19 , the wormhole connects two asymptotically locally ads spacetimes so that the geometry at the boundary is locally given by @xmath20 .",
    "actually , it is simple to check that the field equations are solved provided the base manifold @xmath16 has a negative constant ricci scalar . indeed , for a metric of the form ( metric ) the vielbeins can be chosen as@xmath21where @xmath22 is the dreibein of @xmath16 , so that curvature two - form is such that the only nonvanishing components of @xmath23 read@xmath24replacing eqs .",
    "( [ curvaturebar ] ) in the field equations ( [ feqfive ] ) it turns out that the components @xmath25 and @xmath26 are identically satisfied . the remaining field equation , @xmath27",
    ", reads@xmath28which implies that @xmath16 must be a manifold with a constant ricci scalar satisfying@xmath29one can notice that the field equations ( [ feqfive ] ) are deterministic unless @xmath16 were chosen as having negative constant curvature , i.e. , being locally isomorphic to @xmath30 .",
    "if so , the field equations would degenerate in such a way that the component @xmath31 of the metric becomes an arbitrary function of @xmath32 .",
    "this degeneracy is a known feature of the class of theories considered here @xcite , and is overcome by choosing a base manifold satisfying ( [ ricciscalar5 ] ) but not being of constant curvature . a simple example of a compact smooth three - dimensional manifold fulfilling these conditions is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 has radius @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is a freely acting discrete subgroup of @xmath37 . it worth pointing out that @xmath16 is not an einstein manifold , and that any nontrivial solution of the corresponding yamabe problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) provides a suitable choice for @xmath16 .",
    "the causal structure of the wormhole is depicted in fig .",
    "1 , where the dotted vertical line shows the position of the neck , and the solid bold lines correspond to the asymptotic regions located at @xmath38 , each of them resembling an ads spacetime but with a different base manifold since the usual sphere @xmath39 must be replaced by @xmath16 . the line at the center stands for @xmath40 .",
    "it is apparent from the diagram that null and timelike curves can go forth and back from the neck .",
    "furthermore , note that radial null geodesics are able to connect both asymptotic regions in finite time .",
    "indeed , one can see from ( [ metric ] ) that the coordinate time that a photon takes to travel radially from one asymptotic region , @xmath41 , to the other at @xmath42 is given by@xmath43 _ { -\\infty } ^{+\\infty } = \\pi , \\]]which does not depend on @xmath11 .",
    "thus , any static observer located at @xmath44 says that this occurred in a proper time given by @xmath45 .",
    "note also that this observer actually lives on a static timelike geodesic , and it is easy to see that a small perturbation along @xmath32 makes him to oscillate around @xmath40 .",
    "this means that gravity is pulling towards the fixed hypersurface defined by @xmath40 which is parallel to the neck .",
    "hence , the constant @xmath11 corresponds to a modulus parametrizing the proper distance between this hypersurface and the neck .",
    "actually , one can explicitly check that radial timelike geodesics are always confined since they satisfy@xmath46where the dot stand for derivatives with respect to the proper time @xmath47 , and the velocity is normalized as @xmath48 .",
    "thus , one concludes that the position of a radial geodesic , @xmath49 , in proper time behaves as a particle in a pschl - teller potential .",
    "therefore , as it can also be seen from the penrose diagram , null and spacelike radial geodesics connect both asymptotic regions in finite time .",
    "furthermore , timelike geodesics for which @xmath50 are shown to be confined .",
    "the euclidean continuation of the wormhole metric ( [ metric ] ) is smooth independently of the euclidean time period , so that the wormhole could be in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath of arbitrary temperature .",
    "it is then useful to evaluate the euclidean action for this configuration .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the action @xmath51 can be regularized by adding a suitable boundary term in a background independent way , which can be written just in terms of the extrinsic curvature and the geometry at the boundary .",
    "the total action then reads @xmath52 , where the boundary term reads@xmath53for the wormhole solution , the boundary of @xmath54 is of the form , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 has a reversed orientation with respect to that of @xmath57 .",
    "using the fact that the only non vanishing components of the second fundamental form @xmath58 for the wormhole ( [ metric ] ) , for each boundary , are given by@xmath59where @xmath47 now stands for the euclidean time .",
    "it is simple to verify that the action principle @xmath60 attains an extremum for the wormhole solution .",
    "let us evaluate the action @xmath60 for the wormhole ( [ metric ] ) with a base manifold of the form @xmath61 .",
    "assuming that the boundaries , are located at @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , one obtains that@xmath64 _",
    "{ \\rho _ { -}}^{\\rho _ { + } } , \\]]where @xmath65 is the euclidean time period , and @xmath66 is the volume of the base manifold @xmath16 in terms of the radius of @xmath67 and the genus of @xmath68 , given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .    therefore , remarkably , the regularized euclidean action @xmath60 does not depend on the integration constant @xmath11 , and it vanishes for each boundary regardless their position .",
    "this means that the euclidean continuation of the wormhole can be seen as an instanton with vanishing euclidean action .",
    "consequently , the total mass of the wormhole is found to vanish since @xmath71 .",
    "the same results extend to any base manifold with a ricci scalar satisfying eq .",
    "( ricciscalar5 ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the value of the regularized action for the wormhole is lower than the one for ads spacetime , which turns out to be @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the volume of @xmath39 .",
    "however , ads spacetime has a negative vacuum energy \" given by @xmath74 .",
    "the fact that the action principle @xmath75 has an extremum for the wormhole solution , also allows to compute the mass from the following surface integral @xcite@xmath76which is obtained by the straightforward application of noether s theorem . over a @xmath77-form @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 , and @xmath80 stands for the boundary of the spacelike section .",
    "] the mass is obtained evaluating ( [ qchi ] ) for the timelike killing vector @xmath81 , and one then confirms that the mass , @xmath82 , vanishes for the lorenzian solution .",
    "we would like to remark that , following this procedure , one obtains that the contribution to the total mass coming from each boundary reads@xmath83where @xmath84 is the value of ( [ qchi ] ) at @xmath85 , which again does not depend on @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this means that for a positive value of @xmath11 , the mass of the wormhole appears to be positive for observers located at @xmath86 , and negative for the ones at @xmath88 , such that the total mass always vanishes .",
    "this provides a concrete example of what wheeler dubbed _ mass without mass\"_. hence , the integration constant @xmath89 could also be regarded as a parameter for the apparent mass at each side of the wormhole , which vanishes only when the solution acquires reflection symmetry , i.e. , for @xmath90 .",
    "the five - dimensional static wormhole solution in vacuum , given by eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , can be extended as an exact solution for a very special class of gravity theories among the lovelock family in higher odd dimensions @xmath0 . in analogy with the procedure in five dimensions ,",
    "the theory can be constructed so that the relative couplings between each lovelock term are chosen so that the action has the highest possible power in the curvature and possesses a unique ads vacuum of radius @xmath7 .",
    "the field equations then read@xmath91which are solved by the straightforward extension of ( [ metric ] ) to higher dimensions@xmath92 , \\]]where @xmath11 is an integration constant , and @xmath93 stands for the metric of the base manifold . in the generic case , the base manifold must solve the following equation dimensions with a unit ads radius.]@xmath94where @xmath22 is the vielbein of @xmath95 .",
    "note that this is a single scalar equation .",
    "as in the five - dimensional case , it is worth to remark that the field equations ( [ feqd ] ) are deterministic unless @xmath95 solves the field equations for the same theory in @xmath96 dimensions with unit ads radius .",
    "if so , the field equations would degenerate and the metric component @xmath31 would be an arbitrary function of @xmath32 . in particular , the hyperbolic space @xmath97 falls within this degenerate class .",
    "therefore , in order to circumvent this degeneracy , the base manifold must fulfill eq .",
    "( [ trcs ] ) , but without solving simultaneously the field equations for the same theory in @xmath96 dimensions with unit ads radius .",
    "a  simple example of a compact smooth @xmath98-dimensional manifold fulfilling the latter conditions is given by @xmath99 , where @xmath100 has radius @xmath101 , and @xmath36 is a freely acting discrete subgroup of @xmath102 .",
    "note that @xmath103 is not an einstein manifold .",
    "the metric in higher odd dimensions then describes a static wormhole with a neck of radius @xmath7 connecting two asymptotic regions which are locally ads spacetimes , so that the geometry at the boundary is given by @xmath104 .",
    "the wormhole in higher dimensions shares the features described in the five - dimensional case , including the meaning of the parameter @xmath11 , and its causal structure is depicted in fig . 1 .    as in the five - dimensional case , the euclidean continuation of the wormhole metric is smooth and it has an arbitrary euclidean time period .",
    "the euclidean action can be regularized in higher odd dimensions in a background independent way as in ref .",
    "@xcite , by the addition of a suitable boundary term which is the analogue of ( [ boundaryterm5 ] ) , and can also be written in terms of the extrinsic curvature and the geometry at the boundary .",
    "the nonvanishing components of the second fundamental form @xmath58 acquire the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ thetas ] ) for higher dimensions , so that it is easy to check that the regularized action has an extremum for the wormhole solution . as in the five - dimensional case ,",
    "the euclidean continuation of the wormhole can be seen as an instanton with a regularized action that vanishes independently of the position of the boundaries , so that its mass is also found to vanish .",
    "this means that ads spacetime has a greater action than the wormhole , but a lower vacuum energy \" .    the wormhole mass for the lorenzian solution",
    "can also be shown to vanish making use of a surface integral which is the extension of ( [ qchi ] ) to higher odd dimensions @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the total mass coming from each boundary does not depend on the location of the boundaries and is given by@xmath105so that for a nonvanishing integration constant @xmath11 , the wormhole appears to have mass without mass \" . here",
    "@xmath106 ( 2n-1)!$ ] .",
    "it is simple to show that for different base manifolds , the euclidean action also vanishes , and the surface integrals for the mass possess a similar behavior .",
    "the existence of interesting solutions in vacuum could be regarded as a criterion to discriminate among the different possible gravity theories that arise only in dimensions greater than four .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that , among the lovelock family , selecting the theories as having a unique maximally symmetric vacuum solution guarantees the existence of well - behaved black hole solutions @xcite , @xcite . in turn",
    ", it has been shown that demanding the existence of simple compactifications describing exact black @xmath77-brane solutions , selects the same class of theories @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this sense",
    ", the theory possessing the highest possible power in the curvature with a unique ads vacuum is particularly interesting and it is singled out for diverse reasons .",
    "it is worth to mention that in this case , the lagrangian can be written as a chern - simons gauge theory for the ads  group @xcite , so that the local symmetry is enlarged from lorentz to ads .",
    "one can see that the wormhole solution found here is not only a vacuum solution for these theories , but also for their locally supersymmetric extension in five @xcite and higher odd dimensions @xcite .",
    "the compactification of the wormhole solution is straightforward since it has been shown that it always admits a base manifold with a @xmath67 factor .",
    "this means that in one dimension below , the geometrical and causal behavior is similar to the one described here , but in this case the base manifold is allowed to be locally a hyperbolic space without producing a degeneracy of the field equations .",
    "note that the dimensionally reduced solution is supported by a nontrivial dilaton field with a nonvanishing stress - energy tensor .    _",
