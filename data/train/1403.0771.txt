    "a fundamental property in wormhole physics , in the context of classical general relativity , is that these exotic geometries are supported by `` exotic matter '' @xcite , which involves a stress - energy tensor @xmath3 that violates the null energy condition ( nec ) , i.e. , has @xmath4 at the wormhole throat and its neighbourhood , where @xmath5 is _ any _ null vector @xcite .",
    "a wide variety of solutions have been obtained since the seminal morris - thorne paper @xcite , ranging from dynamic wormhole geometries @xcite , rotating solutions @xcite , thin - shell wormholes constructed using the cut - and - paste technique @xcite , observational signatures using thin accretion disks @xcite , solutions in conformal symmetry , which presents a more systematic approach in searching for exact wormhole solutions @xcite , wormhole geometries in the semi - classical regime @xcite , and more recently in modified theories of gravity @xcite .    in the modified gravity context",
    ", it was shown that the normal matter threading the wormhole can be constrained to satisfy the null energy condition , and it is the higher order curvature terms , interpreted as a gravitational fluid , that sustain these non - standard wormhole geometries , fundamentally different from their counterparts in general relativity .",
    "it has also been argued that wormhole solutions can be supported by several dark energy models responsible for the late - time cosmic acceleration @xcite , by imposing specific equations of state . in this work ,",
    "we explore the possibility that wormholes could be supported by quark matter at extreme densities .",
    "this approach is motivated by theoretical and experimental investigations of baryonic structure showing that strange quark matter , consisting of the @xmath0 ( up ) , @xmath1 ( down ) and @xmath2 ( strange ) quarks is the most energetically favorable state of baryon matter .",
    "the idea of the existence of stars made of quarks was initially introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "two ways of formation of stellar strange matter have been proposed in @xcite and @xcite : the quark - hadron phase transition in the early universe , and the conversion of neutron stars into strange ones at ultrahigh densities . in the theories of strong interactions",
    "the quark bag models suppose that the breaking of physical vacuum takes place inside hadrons . as a result",
    "the vacuum energy densities inside and outside a hadron become essentially different and the vacuum pressure @xmath6 on a bag wall equilibrates the pressure of quarks thus stabilizing the system @xcite .",
    "the structure of a realistic strange star is very complicated but its basic properties can be described as follows @xcite .",
    "beta - equilibrated strange quark - star matter consists of an approximately equal mixture of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks , with a slight deficit of the latter .",
    "the fermi gas of @xmath7 quarks constitutes a single color - singlet baryon with baryon number @xmath8 .",
    "this structure of the quarks leads to a net positive charge inside the star .",
    "since stars in their lowest energy state are supposed to be charge neutral , electrons must balance the net positive quark charge in strange matter stars @xcite .    however , the electrons , being bound to the quark matter by the electromagnetic interaction only ( and not by the strong force ) , are able to displace freely across the quark surface .",
    "but they can not move to infinity because of the electrostatic interaction with quarks .",
    "the electron distribution extends up to @xmath9 fm above the quark surface .",
    "the coulomb barrier at the quark surface of a hot strange star could represent a powerful source of electron - positron ( @xmath10 ) pairs @xcite , which are created in the extremely strong electric field of the barrier . at surface temperatures of around @xmath11",
    "k , the luminosity of the quark star surface may be of the order @xmath12 ergs@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to both photon emission and @xmath10 pair production , for about @xmath14 s for normal quark matter and for up to around @xmath15 s for superconducting quark matter , the thermal luminosity from the quark star surface may be orders of magnitude higher than the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "the existence of a large variety of color superconducting states of quark matter at ultra - high densities has also been suggested and intensively investigated @xcite . at very high densities",
    ", matter is expected to form a degenerate fermi gas of quarks in which the quark cooper pairs with very high binding energy condense near the fermi surface .",
    "this phase of the quark matter is called a color superconductor .",
    "such a state is significantly more bound than ordinary quark matter .",
    "this implies that at extremely high density the ground state of quark matter is the superconducting color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase , and that this phase of matter rather than nuclear matter may be the ground state of hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "the existence of the cfl phase can enhance the possibility of the existence of a pure stable quark star @xcite .    in this context , the possibility that stellar mass black holes , with masses in the range of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , could be in fact quark stars in the cfl phase was considered in @xcite .",
    "depending on the value of the gap parameter , rapidly rotating cfl quark stars can achieve much higher masses than standard neutron stars , thus making them possible stellar mass black hole candidates .",
    "moreover , quark stars have a very low luminosity and a completely absorbing surface  the infalling matter on the surface of the quark star is converted into quark matter .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to investigate the possibility that wormhole geometries can be realized by using quark matter , in both normal and superconducting phases . to describe quark matter we adopt the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) bag model equation of state , while for the investigation of the superconducting quark matter we consider the equation of state obtained in a first order expansion of the free energy of the system .",
    "generally the equations of state depend on several parameters , of which the most important are the bag and the gap constant .",
    "the bag constant forces the quarks to remain confined inside the baryons , while the gap constant describes the superconducting properties of the quark matter .",
    "however , in high density systems , which can be achieved , for example , in the interior of neutron stars , both the bag and the gap constants , as well as the quark masses , become effective , density dependent functions .",
    "it is exactly this property of strongly interacting systems in dense media we will exploit in order to obtain wormhole solutions of the static , spherically symmetric gravitational field equations in the presence of quark matter . by appropriately choosing the forms of the bag and gap functions several wormhole type solutions of the gravitational field equations",
    "are obtained , with the matter source represented by normal and superconducting quark matter , respectively .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [ eos ] , the quark matter equations of state are presented . in section  [ secii ] , we explore the conditions under which wormhole geometries may be supported by the equations of state considered in the theoretical investigations of quark - gluon interactions .",
    "we discuss and conclude our results in section [ concl ]",
    "the state of matter at extreme densities represents one of the most important subjects of study in present day physics .",
    "the problem is complicated , not only from the theoretical point of view , but also by the fact that laboratory experiments can not provide the necessary data for a full understanding of the question . in order to test our understanding of the relevant physics",
    "we need to turn to astrophysics , and the dynamics of compact general relativistic objects .",
    "in fact , `` neutron stars '' represent unique laboratories of such extreme physics . with core densities reaching about one order of magnitude beyond nuclear saturation , they are likely to contain exotic states of matter like hyperon phases with net strangeness and/or deconfined quarks @xcite .",
    "the theory of the equation of state of quark matter is directly based on the fundamental quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) lagrangian , given by @xcite l_qcd&=&_af_^af^a+ + & & _ f=1^n_f| ( i^_-g^a_^a - m_f ) , [ s1 ] where the subscript @xmath18 denotes the various quark flavors @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath19 etc . , @xmath20 is the coupling constant , and @xmath21 is the vector potential taking values in the lie algebra with generators @xmath22 .",
    "the nonlinear gluon field strength @xmath23 is given by @xmath24    qcd predicts a weakening of the quark - quark interaction at short distances ( or high momenta @xmath25 ) , because the one - loop series for the gluon propagator yields a running coupling constant @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of active quark flavors and the qcd scale parameter @xmath28 mev .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath29 vanishes for high momenta @xmath25 , and tends to infinity for @xmath30 .      assuming that interactions of quarks and gluons are sufficiently small",
    ", the energy density @xmath31 and pressure @xmath32 of a quark - gluon plasma at temperature @xmath33 and chemical potential @xmath34can be calculated by thermal theory . neglecting quark masses in first order perturbation theory , the equation of state is @xcite @xmath35 or @xmath36where @xmath37 is the strong interaction coupling constant , and @xmath6 is the difference between the energy density of the perturbative and non - perturbative qcd vacuum ( the bag constant ) .",
    "the thermodynamic parameters of the quark - gluon plasma are related by the equation of state of the quark matter , given by @xmath38 or @xmath39    the entropy density of the quark - gluon plasma is given by @xmath40 .",
    "equation ( 6 ) is essentially the equation of state of a gas of massless particles with corrections due to the qcd trace anomaly and perturbative interactions .",
    "these are always negative , and when @xmath41 they reduce the energy density at a given temperature by about a factor of two @xcite .",
    "most of the investigations of the stellar quark - gluon plasma have been done under the assumption of the electric charge neutrality of the quark - gluon plasma that reads @xmath42 . in the case of a star formed from massless @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "quarks the charge neutrality condition can be explicitly formulated as @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated investigations of quark - gluon interactions have shown that eq .",
    "( [ s6 ] ) represents a limiting case of more general equations of state . for example , mit bag models with massive strange quarks and lowest order qcd interactions lead to some correction terms in the equation of state of quark matter .",
    "models incorporating restoration of chiral quark masses at high densities and giving absolutely stable strange matter can no longer be accurately described by using eq .",
    "( [ s6 ] ) . if the quark interaction is described by a colour - debye - screened inter - quark vector potential , originating from gluon exchange , and by a density - dependent scalar potential , which restores chiral symmetry at high density ( in the limit of massless quarks ) the resulting eos has asymptotic freedom built in , shows confinement at zero baryon density , and deconfinement at high density .",
    "this density - dependent scalar potential arises from the density dependence of the in - medium effective quark masses @xmath44 , which are assumed to depend on the baryon number density @xmath45 @xcite .    on the other hand , in these types of models the equation of state @xmath46 can be well approximated by a linear function in the energy density @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the linear approximation of the equation of state was studied in @xcite , and all the parameters of the eos have been obtained as polynomial functions of the strange quark mass , qcd coupling constant and bag constant .",
    "it is generally agreed today that the color - flavor - locked state is likely to be the ground state of matter , at least for asymptotic densities , and even if the quark masses are unequal @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the equal number of flavors is enforced by symmetry , and electrons are absent , since the mixture is automatically neutral .",
    "the properties of the cfl quark matter depends strongly on the values of the deconfinement phase transition density and the cfl gap parameter , which are poorly known from both a theoretical and experimental point of view .",
    "the free energy density @xmath47 for quark matter in the cfl phase is given by @xcite _ cfl ( , _ e)&=&_cfl^quarks()+_cfl^gb(,_e ) + & & + _ cfl^electrons(_e ) , where @xmath48 is the contribution from the goldstone bosons arising due to the breaking of chiral symmetry in the cfl phase . by assuming that the mass @xmath49 of the @xmath2 quark is not large compared to the chemical potential @xmath50",
    ", the thermodynamical potential of the quark matter in the cfl phase can be approximated as @xcite _",
    "cfl&=&-+-m_s^4 + & & -^2 ^ 2+b , where @xmath51 is the gap energy . with the use of this expression the",
    "pressure @xmath32 of the quark matter in the cfl phase can be obtained as an explicit function of the energy density @xmath31 in the form luho02 @xmath52 where @xmath53and [ alpha ] = -+ .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ pres ] ) can finally be expressed as @xmath54 which will be useful in the analysis outlined below .",
    "in this work , motivated by the proposal that at high densities the phases of quark matter are described either by the equation of state of the mit bag model , or by the cfl phase equation of state , we consider the possibility that wormhole geometries can be supported by quark matter , in both normal and superconducting states .    in the following",
    "we assume that the wormhole metric takes the form @xcite @xmath55 where the metric function @xmath56 is denoted the redshift function and @xmath57 the shape function @xcite .",
    "the redshift function @xmath56 must be finite everywhere to avoid the presence of event horizons @xcite . in order to have a wormhole geometry ,",
