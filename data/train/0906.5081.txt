    "nuclear reactions with heavy - ion beams have been revealing many interesting behaviours of the atomic nucleus . among them , fusion of two heavy ions into one spherical nucleus is an interesting process which is not yet well understood , although the fusion probability is crucially important for synthesis of the so - called super - heavy elements .",
    "it is well known that fusion reactions of light systems and heavy systems have different feature : in light systems , the fusion cross section can be explained by the overcoming of the coulomb barrier between projectile and target ( for instance , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while in heavy systems , the experimental fusion cross sections start to be appreciable at higher energies than the coulomb barrier , that is , are much smaller than those calculated with the same model as that of the light systems ( examples at ref .",
    "it means that the fusion barrier in heavy systems appears to be higher than the coulomb barrier .",
    "the phenomenon in heavy systems is called fusion hindrance , and the corresponding energy difference between the fusion and the coulomb barriers is called extra - push energy .",
    "theoretical attempts to explain this phenomenon are made with moderate success . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was explained by an internal barrier which must be overcome after passing over the usual coulomb barrier .",
    "the internal barrier could be thought as the conditional saddle point in the liquid - drop potential as well as could be attributed to an effective barrier due to the dissipation of the incident kinetic energy@xcite .",
    "but there was no simple explanation of the mechanism of the hindrance , and therefore no theoretical predictions with quantitative reliability .",
    "since there are two barriers for the fusion , we have proposed a model where the fusion reaction is divided into two steps : ( i ) the projectile and target overcome the coulomb barrier and reach the contact configuration , ( ii ) the touched projectile and target evolve from di - nucleus to the spherical compound nucleus by passing over the ridge line of the ldm potential @xcite .",
    "the model explains the extra - push energy and furthermore gives an energy dependent fusion cross sections @xcite .",
    "according to the compound nucleus theory , production cross sections are given by the fusion and the survival probabilities .",
    "in the present paper , presuming that the internal barrier plays a crucial role in the fusion hindrance , we analyze a relation between the saddle point ( more generally a conditional saddle or a ridge line ) and the occurrence of the hindrance .",
    "the dissipative dynamics of the passing - over of the saddle point has been already studied analytically with the simplification of the inverted barrier @xcite . according to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the hindrance is given by the saddle point height measured from the energy of the di - nucleus configuration formed by the projectile and the target nuclei of the incident channel .",
    "in other words , there is no hindrance for cases with no saddle point height .",
    "therefore , the border between the normal and the hindered fusion is given by the condition that the saddle point height be equal to zero , that is , the di - nucleus configuration be on the top of the saddle point .    in mass - symmetric reactions ,",
    "the ridge line is simplified into a saddle point , which makes analysis to be simpler .",
    "below , we will find out the region of fusion hindrance for mass - symmetric reactions by using the finite range ldm with two - center parametrization of nuclear shapes @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it is very difficult to distinguish between fission events coming from the fused compound nuclei and so - called quasi - fission events coming from a di - nuclear system",
    ". therefore , experimental fusion cross sections might not be reliable enough for quantitative comparisons with theoretical calculations . in the present paper ,",
    "we , thus , focus on the appearance and disappearance of the hindrance that is clearly observed in the symmetric systems .    the present paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii recapitulates the parametrization of the di - nuclear system .",
    "the determination of the neck parameters which has been recently obtained by the present authors @xcite is reminded , and a prediction of the fusion hindrance area is shown in sec .",
    "iii for mass - symmetric systems .",
    "iv gives a summary .",
    "there are several ways to parametrize the shape of the amalgamated system . the more accurate description , the more parameters . in this paper",
    "we use the two - center parametrization , using three important parameters which are : distance between two centers @xmath2 , the mass asymmetry parameter @xmath3 , and the neck parameter @xmath4 , as shown in fig .",
    "the first one is defined as a dimensionless parameter as follows ,    [ ptbh ]    fig1.eps    @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the distance between two centers of the harmonic potentials , and @xmath7 the radius of the spherical compound nucleus .",
    "the mass - asymmetry parameter is defined as usual , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are mass numbers of the constituent nuclei .",
    "the neck parameter @xmath4 is defined by the ratio of the smoothed height at the connection point of the two harmonic potentials ( @xmath11 ) and that of spike potential ( @xmath12 ) , i.e. , @xmath13 in this description , nuclear shape is defined by equi - potential surfaces with a constant volume . for example , @xmath4 = 1.0 means no correction , i.e. , complete di - nucleus shape , while @xmath4 = 0.0 means no spike , i.e. , flatly connected potential , which describes highly deformed mono - nucleus .",
    "thus , the neck describes shape evolution of the compound system from di - nucleus to mono - nucleus .",
    "the initial parameters for @xmath2 and @xmath3 are @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively . in mass - symmetric case ,",
    "@xmath16{4}=1.5874 $ ] and @xmath17 the initial value of @xmath4 will be explained in the next section .",
    "with the parametrization of the amalgamated system , the finite range ldm potential can be calculated . in order to study the neck - dependence of the saddle point , the ldm potentials of , as an example",
    ", @xmath18mo + @xmath18mo as a function of @xmath2 for different neck parameters are given in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "it is clearly shown that the saddle point is very sensitive to the @xmath4 : when @xmath4 is smaller ( thicker neck ) , the saddle point is shifted to lower and wider place .",
    "therefore , how the neck changes at contact configuration is a very important problem . to reveal the driving effect of the ldm potential on the neck , the relation between ldm potential at contact configuration and @xmath4 is plotted in fig . [ fig2](b ) .",
    "the large positive slope of ldm potential with respect to @xmath4 ( @xmath19 ) drives the neck at contact to be thicker with @xmath4 up to 0 .",
    "this is natural , considering the strong surface tension of the nuclear matter and a sensitive change of the surface area due to the variation of the @xmath4 .",
    "since we also know that the inertia mass for the @xmath4 degree of freedom is small , its momentum is expected to be quickly equilibrated , compared with the other two degrees of freedom : so @xmath4 very quickly reaches the end at @xmath4 = 0.0 , starting with @xmath4 = 1.0 .",
    "actually , due to actions of the random force associated to the friction , the @xmath4 reaches the equilibrium quickly , far quicker than the time scale of the radial fusion motion @xcite .",
    "thus , when the projectile and target touch with each other , the neck firstly reaches its equilibrium , and then the other two degrees of freedom start to evolve toward the compound stage .",
    "the neck parameter at equilibrium can be determined through the average of @xmath4 via@xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the temperature of the system . in most cases , @xmath23 is close to 0.1",
    ". therefore we take @xmath24 in next calculations .",
    "this value is also used in the fusion cross section calculations in two - step model @xcite , which shows a good agreement with experimental data .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig2.eps    from fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , it is obvious that , for @xmath18mo + @xmath18mo , the contact point @xmath25 @xmath26 is located inside the saddle point @xmath27 @xmath28 at @xmath24 , which means that the di - nucleus automatically reaches the compound nucleus after overcoming the coulomb barrier , i.e. , no fusion hindrance exists for this case . following the same way , we can make the same calculation for each mass - symmetric reactions to find out the region where the fusion hindrance disappears , or extra - push energy is zero .      to study the appearance of the hindrance phenomena",
    ", one should compare the relative positions of the coulomb barrier and the conditional saddle point with the neck set at @xmath24 .",
    "the location of the coulomb barrier depends on the model , but also on the neck parameter @xcite , but it is always beyond the contact point of the two rigid spheres at contact . here , with a conservative point of view , we will choose this contact point as a reference .",
    "for a certain mass - symmetric reaction , the conditional saddle point position can be compared with the contact point to determine if the extra - push appears or not .",
    "if the contact point is located on the inner side of saddle point , the di - nucleus system will evolve automatically from the touching point to the compound stage by the driving force @xmath29 .",
    "otherwise , an additional ldm barrier has to be overcome , which needs an extra - push energy .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig3.eps    to find out the fusion hindrance region of the reaction @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 , we fix @xmath33 and determine the saddle point for each @xmath34 . fig . [ fig3 ] shows an example for @xmath35 . for very small and very large @xmath34 the contact point is located outside the saddle point , while for @xmath36 , the contact point is inside the saddle point , which means that there is no fusion hindrance in this region . therefore , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where the contact point is overlapping with the saddle point , are critical mass numbers  corresponding to the @xmath33 .    [ ptb ]",
    "fig4.eps    changing the proton number @xmath33 , series of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are determined and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . the shadowed area ( including the border )",
    "represents the reactions of @xmath39 and consequently where fusion hindrance does not exist , while the white space represents the contrary .",
    "it is interesting that for @xmath40 , both @xmath37 and @xmath38 increase with increasing @xmath33 , but the width of ( @xmath41 ) becomes narrower and narrower .",
    "when @xmath33 is larger than 43 , all of the ldm saddle points of the reaction @xmath30 @xmath42 are located inside the contact points .",
    "therefore , the extra - push energy should be considered for all mass - symmetric reactions with @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that the reactions @xmath43zr",
    "+ @xmath43zr and @xmath44mo + @xmath18mo do not have fusion hindrance while the @xmath45pd + @xmath46pd reactions does @xcite . to compare with the above theoretical analysis ,",
    "the three reactions are also pointed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , in which two dots for @xmath43zr and @xmath18mo systems are inside the shadowed area , while the dot for @xmath45pd system is in the white space .",
    "the results show that the theoretical analysis is in a good agreement with experimental data for mass - symmetric reactions . using @xmath47 as a criteria , @xmath48 , which is also in agreement with the empirical rule used to determine the appearance of the hindrance .",
    "in summary , the fusion hindrance of mass - symmetric reactions is studied with the two - center model , in which three parameters ( dimensionless distance between two centers @xmath2 , neck parameters @xmath4 , mass asymmetry parameter @xmath3 ) are employed to describe the di - nuclear system .",
    "because of the very fast evolution of @xmath4 compared to the other two degrees of freedom , @xmath4 is set to its equilibrium value 0.1 . in order to find out the reactions where the fusion hindrance does not exist ,",
    "the position of the saddle point and the contact point for @xmath30 @xmath42 are compared for different @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is found that the mass - symmetric fusion reactions without hindrance are located only in a limited area , and @xmath33 should be @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "while for systems with @xmath33 larger than 43 , all of the mass - symmetric reactions are hindered , i.e. , the extra - push energy should be required to form the compound nucleus .",
    "experimental studies around the predicted border are strongly called for . quantitative comparisons of fusion cross sections or of fusion probabilities should be made between experiments and theoretical results , for which the sticking probability in the two - step model , i.e. , effects of over - coming of the coulomb barrier have to be taken into account , though there are ambiguities .    following the same method ,",
    "the fusion hindrance in mass - asymmetric reactions can also be studied . however , the determination of the saddle in two dimensional ldm potential is more complicate than the symmetric case .",
