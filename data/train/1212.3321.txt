    "inspired by the observation of ( and rapidly growing body of experimental information on ) jet quenching in relativistic heavy ion collisions , there has for many years been an interest in the theory of jet quenching and what can be learned about that theory by studying interesting limiting cases .",
    "one of the simplest - to - pose thought experiments is this : how far does a very - high momentum excitation ( the potential precursor of a would - be jet ) travel in a thermal qcd medium before it loses energy , stops , and thermalizes in the medium ? and how does the answer to that question depend on the effective strength @xmath1 of the strong coupling ?",
    "this question can be addressed from first principles in various theoretical limits .",
    "one such limit is that of weak coupling , which in principle applies to asymptotically large temperatures @xmath2 and jet energies @xmath3 , for which the relevant running values of @xmath1 are small . in that limit ,",
    "the stopping distance @xmath4 for a high - energy parton ( @xmath5 ) scales with energy as @xmath6 , up to logarithms .",
    "( up to logarithms ) at weak coupling . ]",
    "a contrasting limit of interest occurs when the running values of @xmath1 relevant to jet stopping are all large .",
    "and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 grows slowly with energy and is the scale of the typical relative momentum between two daughter partons when a high energy parton splits through hard bremsstrahlung or pair production .",
    "( @xmath9 is a scale characteristic of the plasma that parametrizes transverse momentum diffusion of high - energy partons . )",
    "a third limiting case of interest , not addressed in this paper , is where @xmath10 is large but @xmath7 is small .",
    "see , for example , liu , rajagopal , and wiedemann @xcite .",
    "] this problem is not very tractable from first principles in qcd itself , but , through gauge - gravity duality , progress can be made for qcd - like plasmas with gravity duals , such as @xmath0 super yang mills ( sym ) theory .",
    "for some years , people have considered various ways to study analogs of jet stopping in such plasmas , namely the stopping distance for various types of localized , high - momentum excitations .",
    "the exact stopping distance depends on details of exactly how the `` jet '' is prepared , but universally these studies have found that the maximum possible stopping distance @xmath11 scales with energy as @xmath12 @xcite , in contrast to the weak - coupling scaling of @xmath6 .",
    "this is an interesting theoretical result because it teaches us that the scaling of jet stopping with energy depends on the strength of the coupling .",
    "it remains an open question ( which we will not answer here ) how @xmath12 starts to move toward @xmath6 as one lowers the coupling , and vice versa .",
    "the stopping distance of high - momentum , localized excitations traveling through the plasma depends on more than just the energy of the excitation . depending on",
    "exactly how one creates the excitation ( the `` jet '' ) , one may get stopping distances @xmath4 significantly smaller than the maximum @xmath11 .",
    "as an example from weak coupling , imagine that we spread out the total energy and momentum @xmath3 of the jet among 10 partons , each having energy @xmath13 , rather than putting it all into a single parton of energy @xmath3 .",
    "each of the 10 partons has lower energy than the single one and so will stop sooner ; so the stopping distance for the high - momentum excitation depends on how many high - energy partons we use in the initial state . in the weak - coupling case , the maximum stopping distance @xmath14 corresponds to the particular initial state where all the energy is concentrated into a single initial parton .    in the strong - coupling case",
    ", we can not speak of individual partons , but the stopping distance again depends on how we prepare the initial high - momentum excitation . in our work @xcite , we create the initial excitation in a way that is analogous to what you would get if a high - momentum , slightly virtual photon ( or graviton or other massless particle ) decayed hadronically in the quark - gluon plasma , as depicted in fig .  [ fig : wdecay ] .",
    "alternatively , one could consider the decay of a high - momentum on - shell w boson ( also depicted ) .",
    "for these methods of creating `` jets , '' one finds that the maximum possible stopping distance scales as @xmath15 as we will review later , it turns out that the stopping distance may be made smaller than ( [ eq : lmax ] ) by varying the virtuality @xmath16 of the virtual photon ( or equivalently the mass - squared @xmath17 of the on - shell w boson ) @xcite .",
    "the important point is that there is a range of stopping distances @xmath18 for our `` jets , '' depending on the details of how those excitations are created .",
    "examples of the decay of a very high - energy ( a ) slightly virtual photon , ( b ) slightly virtual graviton , or ( c ) on - shell @xmath19 boson , inside a standard - model quark - gluon plasma , producing high - momentum partons moving to the right . in the context of @xmath0 super yang mills , the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22",
    "above represent adjoint - color fermions or scalars carrying r charge . for strong coupling , of course , one should not picture perturbatively , as in this figure , the high - momentum excitation created in the plasma by the decay . ]",
    "most top - down studies of jet stopping using gauge - gravity duality have studied the infinite color and infinite coupling limit , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the t hooft coupling . to understand the true high - energy behavior ,",
    "however , it is important to study the corrections to these limits . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : stopve ] shows two different scenarios one might imagine for the maximum stopping distance @xmath11 for strongly - coupled @xmath0 sym .",
    "one is that @xmath11 grows like @xmath12 at high energy , up to arbitrarily high energies .",
    "the other is that it starts growing like @xmath12 at high energy @xmath5 , but then crosses over to some different power - law behavior once @xmath3 exceeds some positive power of @xmath26 times @xmath2 ( e.g.  @xmath27 in the figure ) . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath12 would not be the true behavior for arbitrarily large @xmath3 and large but finite @xmath26 .",
    "but there is no way to tell the difference between these two scenarios if one only has @xmath24 calculations ! for this reason , three of us analyzed the parametric size of finite-@xmath26 corrections to jet stopping distances in ref .",
    "we found that the formal expansion in @xmath28 ( which corresponds to an expansion in the string parameter @xmath29 on the gravity side ) breaks down for some jets and is safe for others , depending on the stopping distance @xmath4 of the jet ( and therefore on the virtuality @xmath30 ) , as depicted in fig .",

    "the result of this study was that , for @xmath32 , corrections to the @xmath24 result are parametrically small for @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , corrections to the maximum stopping distance @xmath34 are small . but the interesting case is when jets are created in such a way that    [ eq : fun ] @xmath35 which is @xmath36    in this case , the fate of @xmath24 results for the stopping distance was unclear . for @xmath37 ,",

    "[ fig : fall ] turns out to be a spatially _ small _ wavepacket which can be treated in the geometric optics approximation .",
    "the wavepacket s motion is the same ( up to parametrically small corrections ) as that of a 5-dimensional `` particle '' traveling in the ads@xmath46-schwarzschild geometry , and so it follows a geodesic whose trajectory is easily calculated in terms of the 4-momentum @xmath48 of the excitation .",

    "of special importance is the parametric scale @xmath51 in the fifth dimension , where the trajectory turns over and beyond which progress in @xmath49 rapidly slows to a stop . ]",
    "it will be important for what follows to remember that the ads / cft correspondence is really a correspondence between field theory and 10-dimensional string theory . in the strong - coupling limit @xmath24 of the field theory , the general correspondence reduces to one between the field theory and the infrared limit of the string theory , which is a supergravity theory .",
    "the quanta of the supergravity fields correspond to string states that are massless in flat 10-dimensional spacetime , such as the graviton . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the well - known gravitational dual of finite - temperature @xmath52 sym is type iib supergravity in an ( ads@xmath46-schwarzschild)@xmath53 background .",
    "the classical wave packet falling in fig .",
    "[ fig : fall ] is a localized , classical excitation of the supergravity fields . for the sake of specificity , consider the case where it is an excitation of the background gravitational field .",
    "in general , a classical wave is a coherent superposition of the corresponding quanta , and so our high - frequency classical wavepacket is a coherent superposition of high - frequency gravitons .",
    "since our wavepacket behaves like a particle ( in the geometric optics approximation appropriate for @xmath47 ) , let s follow just one of these gravitons .",
    "so think of the trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : fall ] as that of a single high - momentum graviton with a localized wave function . as we will discuss later , interactions between the gravitons that make up the wavepacket are very small , and so it is adequate to think about the evolution of individual high - momentum gravitons .",
    "a graviton is really a tiny loop of string whose internal degrees of freedom are in their ground state .",
    "because of the gravitational field from the black brane , this closed string will feel tidal forces as it falls , which will try to stretch the string in some directions and squeeze it in others . as the graviton gets further from the boundary ( and so closer to the black brane ) , the tidal forces will increase , and eventually they will become large enough to excite the internal string degrees of freedom of the graviton .",
    "we will argue that it is the excitation of these string degrees of freedom that is responsible for the breakdown of the expansion in fig .",
    "[ fig : r4 ] in the problem region ( [ eq : fun ] ) .",
    "we will find that , in the problematic case ( [ eq : fun ] ) where @xmath54 , the tidal forces are strong enough to stretch that loop of string to become classically large before the stopping distance is reached .",
    "this is why stringy corrections can not be ignored in that case , explaining the breakdown of the expansion in fig .",
    "[ fig : r4 ] .",
    "( in contrast , the tidal forces are not strong enough to excite the graviton s internal degrees of freedom soon enough when @xmath55 . )",

    "[ fig : r4 ] ) then has sub - leading impact on @xmath24 results for the stopping distance . but ( [ eq : ratio ] ) also includes cases where the stretching of the string may play an important role : if one considers a situation where the argument of the logarithm in ( [ eq : ratio ] ) is exponentially large , then the logarithm can be large enough to compensate for the factor of @xmath57 .",

    "the first term in the constraint formula ( [ eq : dvstring ] ) , which is what remains if one ignores the tension terms in that equation , simply reproduce the conditions ( [ eq : dvdugeo ] ) found in the earlier analysis based on diverging geodesics . to see this ,",
    "consider the @xmath516 contribution of the first term in ( [ eq : dvstring ] ) to the @xmath436 constraint in ( [ eq : penroseconstraints ] ) : @xmath517 using ( [ eq : kappa ] ) and ( [ eq : dx3 ] ) , the contribution from mode @xmath348 to the left - hand side of ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) is of order @xmath518 summing over the excited modes gives @xmath519 this is the same as the second condition in ( [ eq : dvdugeo ] ) , with the identification ( [ eq : dq3identify ] ) noted before .",
    "similarly , using ( [ eq : kappa ] ) and ( [ eq : ab ] ) , @xmath520 generates @xmath521 which is the same as the first condition in ( [ eq : dvdugeo ] ) , using the identifications of ( [ eq : qperpidentify ] ) and ( [ eq : dq3identify ] ) .    finally , there are the tension terms in the constraint formula ( [ eq : dvstring ] ) for @xmath436 .",
    "one may check that these also do not generate any constraints stronger than ( [ eq : condition ] ) .",
    "before we explain the initial conditions used to simulate the string evolution in fig .",
    "[ fig : string ] , we will take a short detour and explain how to generate a string evolution as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : boost]a .    first , let us notice that near the boundary , the metric is approximately ads .",
    "so the string evolves at very early times in a geometry which is ads .",
    "moreover , in the rest frame of the string considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : boost]a , if the string has a sufficiently large energy , the string excitations probe a geometry which is the penrose limit of an in - falling massless excitation in ads . in other words ,",
    "these excitations probe flat space . to show this",
    "explicitly , we start by expanding around the null geodesic @xmath522 . defining , as in equations ( [ eq : uformula][eq : v ] ) , @xmath523 , yields @xmath524 taking the penrose limit by scaling the coordinates as in ( [ eq : scaling ] ) brings the metric into the rosen form @xmath525 which is just ( [ eq : metricpp0 ] ) with @xmath526 ( i.e.  @xmath527 ) . while this is not immediately recognizable as a flat space metric , a change of coordinates to bring the metric into brinkmann form , @xmath528 , yields @xmath529 which is the @xmath526 limit of ( [ eq : ppmetrichat ] ) . in this geometry",
    "we consider the evolution of an initial string configuration with the string shrunk to a point and with @xmath530 , @xmath531 , @xmath532 , where we have defined @xmath533 and @xmath534 by @xmath535 and @xmath536 .",
    "the other string coordinates remain zero throughout this section .",
    "since the string is point - like at the initial time , the stress - tensor constraint @xmath537 is trivially satisfied , and the second stress tensor constraint @xmath471 was used to solve for the initial condition on @xmath538 . if we choose @xmath539 and @xmath540 such that @xmath541 , the string has an approximate analytic solution of the form @xmath542 , @xmath543 , @xmath544 , or , in the brinkmann coordinates , @xmath545 , @xmath546 , @xmath543 .",
    "next we switch to rosen coordinates , and we require that the string is again point - like at the initial time @xmath547 : @xmath548 , @xmath549 and @xmath550 , where we introduced a boundary regulator @xmath551 . in order to satisfy this set of initial conditions we only have to perform a shift in @xmath552 in the previous brinkmann solution , and use the mapping from brinkmann to rosen coordinates : @xmath553 , @xmath554 , @xmath555 .",
    "this is a solution which oscillates , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillate ] for small @xmath96 .",
    "the envelope of these oscillations grows linearly with @xmath96 and roughly corresponds to fig .",
    "[ fig : boost]a .",
    "an ( approximate ) ads string solution for small @xmath96 showing the type of string we create with our initial conditions , viewed in the 4-dimensional string rest frame .",
    "the snapshots of the string are equally spaced in @xmath150 .",
    "@xmath556 could be any point of the oscillation where the length of the string vanishes .",
    "the straight line geodesics of fig .",
    "[ fig : boost]a may be roughly thought of as corresponding to the dashed lines above , which depict the envelope of the oscillation . ]",
    "the next step is to perform a very large boost along @xmath49 starting from the rest frame we have been discussing so far .",
    "this will give us the appropriate initial conditions used to generate fig .  [ fig : string]a .",
    "again , the string starts as a point - like object very close to the boundary : @xmath557 , @xmath558 , @xmath559 .",
    "we take @xmath560 . the initial ( worldsheet ) time @xmath561 derivatives have the following expressions : @xmath562 , @xmath563 , @xmath564 , where @xmath565 . here",
    "@xmath566 is the energy of the boosted string and @xmath567 is the momentum along the @xmath49 direction in the appropriate units .",
    "earlier in this appendix , we discussed penrose limits of ads in order to motivate our choice of initial conditions .",
    "however , we now simulate the evolution of our classical string from these initial conditions in the full ads@xmath46-schwarzschild geometry , with no such approximation , to obtain fig .",
    "[ fig : string]a . in order to generate a string evolution",
    "to sufficiently late times , we followed @xcite and introduced an appropriate stretching function @xmath568 , @xmath569 with @xmath570 , @xmath349 , @xmath571 .",
    "then redefine the worldsheet time @xmath150 so that the worldsheet metric is @xmath572 the numerical evolution of the classical string was carried out using mathematica .",
    "lastly , to generate fig .",
    "[ fig : string]b , the initial conditions were modified as follows .",
    "the string begins its evolution once more as a point - like object close to the boundary @xmath557 , @xmath573 .",
    "but the initial time @xmath561 derivatives are now @xmath574 , and , as before , the remaining derivative is obtained from the constraint @xmath471 .",
    "the main difference between the two initial conditions is that we have increased the small parameter , which is a placeholder for @xmath575 from 0.02 in the previous numerical simulation to 0.6 here .",
    "[ as a side comment , this parameter can not be increased to arbitrarily large values or else the argument of the square root in @xmath576 becomes negative .",
    "] the stretching function used here is of the same form as in ( [ eq : stretching ] ) , but with different exponents @xmath577 .",
    "this string quickly stretches in @xmath96 .",
    "once one of the folding points reaches the horizon , it remains frozen at that particular value of @xmath49 .",
    "the net result is that we have now generated a string which is folded back , with one folding point at the horizon and trailing behind the rest of the string , while the other folding point is still close to the boundary .",
    "this string is moving with some momentum in the @xmath49 direction .",
