    "selecting agn at one particular wavelength is no guarantee of a complete sample .",
    "x  ray selection has the advantages of being reasonably efficient and reliable @xcite but may miss some obscured sources @xcite .",
    "infrared and radio observations can identify agn missed in the x  ray @xcite and , for x  ray - selected agn , can help to distinguish between the different agn types .",

    "the limited spatial resolution of previous generations of x  ray and infrared observatories made cross - identification between wavelengths difficult .",
    "recent work has benefited from the much smaller point spread functions of the _ chandra x  ray observatory _ , _ xmm - newton _ , the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ , and the _ spitzer space telescope_. @xcite combined _ chandra _ , _ xmm _ , and _ iso _ data from the lockman hole and hubble deep field north to conclude that agn contribute @xmath7% of the cirb at 15  @xmath5 m .",

    "@xcite studied chandra deep field south sources detected at hard x  ray and 24  @xmath5 m   wavelengths and found , surprisingly , that x  ray - hard agn are not infrared - brighter ( as would be expected if they were embedded in the obscuring matter ) .",
    "@xcite found that similarly - selected lockman hole sources exhibit a variety of optical / ir spectral types .",
    "about half of their sources had spectral energy distributions ( seds ) dominated by stellar emission or showed significant obscuration .",

    "based on these data , we identify these four sources as galactic stars and omit them from the following plots and analysis . this contamination rate ( 4/138 = 3% ) is comparable to that found by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ col_mag ] shows that the x  ray sources have different color distributions from the comparison samples .",
    "the x  ray sources irac colors are redder than those of the 8  @xmath5 m  sample in all six band combinations and their irac / mips colors ( @xmath37-[24]$ ] ) are bluer than those of the 24  @xmath5 m  sample .",
    "ks tests show that all of these differences are statistically significant .",
    "the color differences are an indication that the x  ray - producing agn affects the sed of the infrared counterpart , as expected .",
    "the x  ray sources are also about a magnitude brighter than the typical 8  @xmath5m - selected irac source and about 0.3  magnitudes brighter than the typical 24  @xmath5 m  source .",
    "for the x  ray sources , median ab magnitudes in the 4 irac bands are ( 19.85 , 19.95 , 20.04 , 19.98 ) , while the medians for the full egs 8  @xmath5 m  sample are ( 20.91 , 21.03 , 21.00 , 21.14 ) .",
    "the median x  ray source 24  @xmath5 m  flux density is 182  @xmath5jy , compared to 146  @xmath5jy for the 24  @xmath5 m  sample . while it would be interesting if the brighter infrared fluxes indicated that x  ray sources preferentially inhabit more massive galaxies , there is a more mundane explanation : the egs infrared data are deeper than the x  ray data .",
    "we confirmed this by comparing to the chandra deep field - south , where the much shallower ( 470  s ) irac data at 3.6 ( 8.0 )  @xmath5 m  still detects some 90% ( 60% ) of the x  ray sources despite the much deeper x  ray limit in that field .",
    "mid - infrared seds of galaxies containing agn are expected to be comprised of several components which can have different relative luminosities . in nearby galaxies ,",
    "the irac bands contain the rayleigh - jeans tail of the stellar emission and may also include emission from the interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features in the 8  @xmath5 m  band and hot interstellar dust in the 5.8 , and 8  @xmath5 m  bands . at @xmath38 ,",
    "the pah features redshift out of the irac bands and at @xmath39 the ` 1.6  @xmath5 m  bump ' from the h@xmath40 opacity minimum in old stars begins to redshift through the irac bands @xcite . at @xmath41",
    "the pah features are redshifted into the mips 24  @xmath5 m  band .",
    "agn emission in the mid - ir is often phenomenologically described by a red power - law ( @xmath42 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the utility of mid - ir power - laws for selection of agn is further discussed by @xcite , who presented a study of 24  @xmath5 m  sources with power - law ( @xmath43 ) seds in the chandra deep field south . based on the galaxies optical - ir seds and x  ray and ir properties",
    ", they concluded that the majority ( including those not detected in x  rays ) harbor an agn .",
    "as a simple description of the egs x  ray sources mid - ir seds , we attempted to fit a power law to their irac flux densities .",
    "we expected that agn - dominated objects would have red power - laws with @xmath3 , while stellar - dominated galaxies would have blue seds with @xmath44 .",
    "pah emission at 8  @xmath5 m  or redshifted 1.6  @xmath5 m  bump emission will result in poorer fits to a simple power law , as will comparable agn and stellar contributions to the total ir luminosity . using a simple @xmath45 method , we fit power laws to the irac flux densities of the individual sources in the x  ray and comparison samples .",
    "the distributions of power law indices @xmath46 are shown in figure  [ alphas ] .",
    "seventy - eight percent of the x  ray sources ( 104/134 ) had acceptable power - law fits ( @xmath47 ) , with about half of these ( 53 ) having @xmath3 .",
    "( typical uncertainties in @xmath46 for the successful fits are @xmath48 . )",
    "thus _ only about 40% of the egs x  ray sources show the classic red power - law sed in the mid - infrared .",
    "_ as might be expected , these sources are fainter than the blue - power - law sources at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath5 m  but not different at the longer ir wavelengths .",
    "the fraction of comparison sample sources with acceptable power - law fits is about 40% for both the 8- and 24-  @xmath5m - selected samples , and their median @xmath46 is much higher ( @xmath49 for 8  @xmath5 m  sources and @xmath50 for 24  @xmath5 m  sources ) , as expected from their bluer colors .",
    "about 7% of all 8  @xmath5 m  sources and 9% of all 24  @xmath5 m  source have good power - law fits with @xmath3 .",
    "agn and galaxy seds are known to be complex , and , as expected , power - law seds observed in the irac bands do not extrapolate well to the optical and 24  @xmath5 m  bands .",
    "extensions of the irac power - laws to the optical always over - predicted the @xmath28-band magnitudes by large factors and , for the blue sources , under - predicted the 24  @xmath5 m  fluxes by several magnitudes . in the red sources , the agn dominates the irac bands , so",
    "the correlation might be expected to be better : however , the irac power - laws predict the 24  @xmath5 m  values only to within about 60% .    the wide range of spectral shapes exhibited by the egs x  ray sources means that _ no proposed mid - infrared color agn selection will identify all of them .",
    "_ figure  [ 2colors ] compares the irac colors of the egs x  ray sources to those of the egs 8  @xmath5 m  sample in several color - color spaces , where we have marked the regions of irac colors used by various authors to select agn .",
    "the x  ray sources cover a wide range of colors in all of these plots ; the x  ray sources not detected at 24  @xmath5 m  tend to have bluer irac colors ( although this effect is not statistically significant ) .",
    "figure  [ template_2col ] shows the predicted colors of several galaxy and agn templates which combine optical and near - infrared data from the hyperz package @xcite and mid - infrared data from @xcite .",
    "the agn templates have red colors and lie in the agn selection regions at all redshifts ; the starburst galaxy templates move into and out of the selection regions depending on @xmath51 ; and the normal galaxy templates are blue at low @xmath51 but move into the agn regions at high redshifts . from this comparison",
    "we infer that the blue power - law sources are mostly low - redshift galaxies where the galaxy light dominates the mid - ir , while the red power - law sources are mostly dominated by agn light but may also include a few starburst galaxies .",
    "as might be expected , the red power - law sources mostly satisfy the various agn color criteria while the blue power - law and non - power - law sources mostly do not .",
    "important properties of any agn selection criterion are its completeness ( the fraction of all agn selected ) and reliability ( the fraction of selected sources which are truly agn ) . for example , @xcite used optical spectroscopy to determine that some 83% of the sources meeting their mid - ir criterion in the noao deep - wide field / irac shallow survey region were ( mostly broad - lined ) agn . @xcite matched an x  ray survey of the same region to the irac observations and showed that 67% of matched x ",
    "ray / irac sources met the @xcite criterion .",
    "of course , we can not directly assess the reliability of any color criteria for finding agn ( because we do not know how many non - x  ray - detected agn might be in the survey area ) , but we can compute how reliably they select x  ray sources .",
    "the @xcite criterion seems to be both complete and reliable for shallow infrared and x  ray data , but it is important to test it against other criteria and deeper infrared and x  ray data .    selecting x ",
    "ray sources using published irac color criteria does not yield complete samples .",
    "the published irac color criteria of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite select 98 , 68 , and 38 of the 134 egs non - stellar x ",
    "ray sources , respectively , so their completeness is 73% , 51% , and 28% .",
    "the @xcite criterion specifically addressed the selection of type  1 agn only , and this may be the cause of its lower completeness .",
    "detection at 24  @xmath5 m   only slightly increases the probability that a source will fulfill the irac color criteria .",
    "reliability is more difficult to assess .",
    "of all the egs sources in the survey area ( not just the x  ray detections ) , the color criteria select 2015 , 775 , and 580 sources respectively , so their apparent reliabilities are 5% , 9% , and 7% .",
    "if all of the color - selected sources are truly agn , x  ray undetected agn would outnumber detected agn by more than 10 to 1 .",
    "this is not completely unreasonable , since we have shown above that our infrared data are deeper than the x  ray data .",
    "also , @xcite recently found x - ray undetected radio - excess agn in the chandra deep field north , 60% of which are x  ray undetected even in _",
    "exposures @xmath52 times deeper than the egs data .",
    "only about half of the chandra deep field south agn selected by the ir power - law criterion of @xcite are x  ray - detected .",
    "how can we reconcile our results on color selection with the high reliability and completeness found by @xcite and @xcite ?",
    "our low reliabilities in finding x  ray sources are likely due in part to the egs infrared data being deeper than the x  ray data as discussed above .",
    "the much greater depth of the egs _ spitzer _",
    "data compared to the irac shallow survey data used by @xcite and @xcite also means that the two surveys probe different redshift regimes .",
    "as figure  [ template_2col ] shows , agn and normal galaxies have different irac colors at @xmath53 , but at higher redshifts both types of sources have colors meeting the agn selection criteria .",
    "also , @xcite may have found an artificially low contamination rate because they computed it only from _ sources with optical spectroscopy_. their optical spectroscopy is sensitive to galaxies mostly at @xmath54 , meaning that higher - redshift galaxies in the agn selection area would not have been included in their sample . assuming that local templates faithfully represent galaxy and agn seds at high redshift , mid - infrared color selection of agn will be more reliable for samples which do not contain large numbers of high - redshift galaxies . x  ray , optical , and infrared selection all have different contributions to make to agn selection , but no method is both reliable and complete .",
    "comparison of x  ray and infrared fluxes is important for understanding the nature of x  ray sources .",
    "x  ray - to - infrared ratios , particularly @xmath55 , distinguish between agn and starburst galaxies ; the latter should be bright in the ir , but very faint in hard x  rays .",
    "figure  [ xray_ir]a compares @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the egs sources : about two - thirds of the x  ray sources ( @xmath58 ) have both hard x  ray and 24  @xmath5 m  detections .",
    "the distribution of @xmath59 is consistent with agn powering the x ",
    "ray sources emission at both wavelengths , as also found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the two objects with @xmath60 mjy are c72 and x013 , discussed in section  [ sec : scuba ] .",
    "x  ray hardness ratios are often used to indicate agn type , with harder spectra indicating more obscuration .",
    "we use @xmath61 to distinguish between x  ray - hard and soft sources ; this is the equivalent of @xmath62 for a hardness ratio computed from _",
    "chandra _ counts as used by @xcite and @xcite .- corrections , which can be substantial for hardness ratios : see figure  8 of @xcite . ]",
    "the ratio of soft to hard sources in our sample is about 2:1 .",
    "a simple picture of agn classification predicts that x  ray - hard sources should have lower @xmath63 ratios ( since the obscuring dust should increase the 24  @xmath5 m  flux and absorb the hard x  rays ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to first order",
    ", this effect should not depend on redshift since flux ratios are distance - independent .",
    "recent work @xcite has found very little difference in @xmath63 between x  ray - hard and soft sources ; in the egs sample , we also find no statistically significant difference .",
    "the effect of obscuring dust will vary in the irac bands : in the shorter wavelengths , absorption would decrease @xmath64 while at the longer wavelengths , dust emission could increase @xmath64",
    ". we might therefore expect @xmath65 to be similar for obscured and unobscured sources at 3.6  @xmath5 m , and lower for obscured sources at 8  @xmath5 m .",
    "in fact , we find no difference in @xmath65 in the irac bands between x  ray - hard and soft sources .",
    "[ @xmath66 is higher for ir - red sources compared to blue sources , but this merely reflects the fact that red sources are fainter at 3.6  @xmath5 m  ( section  [ sec : ir - prop ] ) . ] comparing the full - band x  ray fluxes ( rather than only the hard band ) to the irac flux densities ( figures  [ xray_ir]b and [ xray_ir]c ) , there _ is _ a statistically significant difference in @xmath67 between x  ray - hard and soft sources : the hard sources have lower @xmath67 at both 3.6 and 8.0  @xmath5 m .",
