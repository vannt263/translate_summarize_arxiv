    "the classification of formal star products @xcite up to equivalence is well - understood , both for the symplectic and the poisson case , see e.g. the textbook @xcite for more details on deformation quantization . while the general classification in the poisson case is a by - product of the formality theorem of kontsevich @xcite , the symplectic case can be obtained easier by various different methods @xcite .",
    "the result is that in the symplectic case there is an intrinsically defined _ characteristic class _ @xmath0}{{\\nu } } + \\hdr^2(m , \\mathbb{c}){\\llbracket { \\nu}\\rrbracket}\\ ] ] for every star product @xmath1 which is a formal series in the second de rham cohomology . by convention ,",
    "one places the symplectic form as reference point in order @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath1 and @xmath3 are equivalent iff @xmath4 . moreover ,",
    "if we denote by @xmath5 the set of equivalence classes of star products quantizing @xmath6 , the characteristic class induces a bijection @xmath7     \\ ; \\mapsto \\ ;     c(\\star ) \\in     \\frac{[\\omega]}{{\\nu } } + \\hdr^2(m , \\mathbb{c}){\\llbracket { \\nu}\\rrbracket}.\\ ] ]    if one has in addition a symmetry in form of a group action of a lie group by symplectic or poisson diffeomorphisms , one is interested in invariant star products .",
    "again , the classification is known both in the symplectic and in the poisson case , at least under certain assumptions on the action .",
    "the general poisson case makes use of the equivariant formality theorem of dolgushev @xcite , which can be obtained whenever there is an invariant connection on the manifold . such an invariant connection exists e.g. if the group action is proper , but also in far more general situations .",
    "in the easier symplectic situation one can make use of fedosov s construction of a star product @xcite and obtain the _",
    "invariant characteristic class _ @xmath8 , now establishing a bijection @xmath9      \\ ; \\mapsto \\ ;      c(\\star ) \\in      \\frac{[\\omega]}{{\\nu } }      +      \\hdr^{\\mathrm{inv,2}}(m , \\mathbb{c}){^{\\mathrm{inv}}}{\\llbracket { \\nu}\\rrbracket},\\ ] ] such that @xmath1 and @xmath3 are invariantly equivalent iff @xmath10 , see @xcite . here",
    "one uses the more refined notion of invariant equivalence of invariant star products , where the equivalence @xmath11 with @xmath12 for @xmath13 is now required to be _",
    "invariant_. moreover , @xmath14 denotes the invariant second de rham cohomology , i.e. invariant closed two - forms modulo differentials of invariant one - forms .",
    "again , one needs an invariant connection for this to work .    in symplectic and poisson geometry , the presence of a symmetry group is typically not enough : one wants the fundamental vector fields of the action to be hamiltonian by means of an @xmath15-equivariant momentum map @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the lie algebra of the group @xmath18 acting on @xmath19 .",
    "the notion of a momentum map has been transferred to deformation quantization in various flavours , see e.g. the early work @xcite .",
    "the resulting general notion of a quantum momentum map is due to @xcite but was already used in examples in e.g. @xcite .",
    "we will follow essentially the conventions from @xcite , see also @xcite : a quantum momentum map is a formal series @xmath20 such that for all @xmath21 the function @xmath22 generates the fundamental vector field by @xmath1-commutators and such that one has the equivariance condition that @xmath23_\\star = { \\nu}{\\mathbf{j}}([\\xi , \\eta])$ ] for @xmath24 . here",
    "the zeroth order is necessarily an equivariant momentum map in the classical sense .",
    "we assume the zeroth order to be fixed once and for all .",
    "the classification we are interested in is now for the pair of a @xmath18-invariant star product @xmath1 and a corresponding quantum momentum map @xmath25 with respect to the equivalence relation determined by _ equivariant equivalence _ :",
    "we say @xmath26 and @xmath27 are equivariantly equivalent if there is a @xmath18-invariant equivalence transformation @xmath28 relating @xmath1 to @xmath3 as before and @xmath29 . in most interesting cases ,",
    "the group @xmath18 is connected and hence invariance is equivalent to infinitesimal invariance under the lie algebra action by fundamental vector fields .",
    "thus it is reasonable to assume a lie algebra action from the beginning , whether it actually comes from a corresponding lie group action or not .",
    "the set of equivalence classes for this refined notion of equivalence will then be denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "the main result of this work is then the following :    [ theorem : maintheorem ] let @xmath6 be a connected symplectic manifold with a strongly hamiltonian action @xmath31 by a real finite - dimensional lie algebra @xmath17 .",
    "suppose there exists a @xmath17-invariant connection .",
    "then there exists a characteristic class @xmath32}{\\nu } + { \\mathrm{h}{_\\lie{g}}}^2(m){\\llbracket { \\nu}\\rrbracket}\\ ] ] establishing a bijection to the formal series in the second equivariant cohomology .",
    "under the canonical map @xmath33 the class becomes the invariant characteristic class .",
    "the main idea is to base the construction of this class on the fedosov construction .",
    "this is where we need the invariant connection in order to obtain invariant star products and quantum momentum maps .",
    "the crucial and new aspect compared to the existence and uniqueness statements obtained earlier is that we have to find an invariant equivalence transformation @xmath28 for which we can explicitly compute @xmath34 in order to compare it to @xmath35 .",
    "of course , the above theorem only deals with the symplectic situation which is substantially easier than the genuine poisson case . here",
    "one can expect similar theorems to hold , however , at the moment they seem out of reach .",
    "the difficulty is , in some sense , to compute the effect of invariant equivalence transformations on quantum momentum maps by means of some chosen equivariant formality , say the one of dolgushev . on a more conceptual side , this can be seen as part of a much more profound equivariant formality conjecture stated by nest and tsygan @xcite .",
    "from that point of view , our result supports their conjecture .",
    "one of our motivations to search for such a characteristic class comes from the classification result of @xmath18-invariant star products up to equivariant morita equivalence @xcite , where a reminiscent of the equivariant class showed up in the condition for equivariant morita equivalence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we collect some preliminaries on invariant star products and the existence of quantum momentum maps .",
    "section  [ sec : fedosov ] contains a brief reminder on those parts of fedosov s construction which we will need in the sequel .",
    "it contains also the key lemma to prove our main theorem . in section  [ sec : classification ]",
    "we establish a relative class which allows to determine whether two given pairs of star products and corresponding quantum momentum maps are equivariantly equivalent . in the last section  [ sec : char ]",
    "we define the characteristic class and complete the proof of the main theorem .",
    "throughout this paper let @xmath36 denote a connected , symplectic manifold , @xmath37 the corresponding poisson bracket , @xmath38 the differential forms on @xmath19 , @xmath39 the closed forms , @xmath17 a real finite - dimensional lie algebra , and @xmath40 a torsion - free , symplectic connection on @xmath19 .",
    "then every anti - homomorphism @xmath41 from @xmath17 into the symplectic vector fields on @xmath19 gives rise to a representation of @xmath17 on @xmath42 via @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the lie derivation . for convenience , we will abbreviate @xmath45 to @xmath46 and analogously for the insertion @xmath47 . in most cases ,",
    "the lie algebra action arises as the infinitesimal action of a lie group action by a lie group @xmath18 acting symplectically on @xmath19 . in the case of a connected lie group",
    ", we can reconstruct the action of @xmath18 as usual .",
    "however , we do not assume to have a lie group action since in several cases of interest the vector fields @xmath48 might not have complete flows .",
    "since the main focus here will be on the interaction between symmetries conveyed by @xmath17 and formal star products on @xmath19 , we shall briefly recall the relevant basic definitions , following notations and conventions from @xcite , see also ( * ? ? ?",

    ". such a star product is called @xmath17-invariant if the @xmath50-linear extension of @xmath46 to @xmath49 is a derivation of @xmath1 for all @xmath58 .",
    "recall further that a linear map @xmath59 is called a ( classical ) hamiltonian for the action if it satisfies @xmath60 for all @xmath21 and @xmath61 .",
    "it is called a ( classical ) momentum map , if in addition @xmath62 ) = \\left\\ { j_0(\\xi ) ,      j_0(\\eta ) \\right\\}$ ] holds for all @xmath63 .",
    "we can adapt a similar notion for star products on @xmath19 by replacing the poisson bracket with the @xmath1-commutator , compare also @xcite .",
    "we will generally adopt the notation @xmath64_\\star$ ] with @xmath65_\\star$ ] being the commutator with respect to the product @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we will , for any vector space @xmath66 , denote by @xmath67 the space of @xmath66-valued , @xmath68-multilinear , alternating forms on @xmath17 .",
    "the following definition is by now the standard notion @xcite :    [ def : prelim_qham ] let @xmath1 be a @xmath17-invariant star product .",

    "if only the first equality is satisfied , we will call @xmath25 a quantum hamiltonian .    evaluating the above equations in zeroth order in @xmath50 for any quantum hamiltonian ( quantum momentum map ) @xmath25 , one can readily observe that @xmath71 is a classical hamiltonian ( momentum map ) .",
    "conversely , we will say that @xmath25 deforms the hamiltonian ( momentum map ) @xmath72 .",

    "finally , the so called total degree @xmath107 will be needed later on .",
    "we can then proceed and define another associative product on @xmath106 first locally in a chart @xmath108 by @xmath109 with @xmath110 , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and with @xmath113 being the insertion of @xmath114 into the first argument on @xmath115 .",
    "the tensorial character of the insertions then shows that this is actually globally well - defined and yields an associative product since the insertions in the symmetric tensors are commuting derivations .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath116 is neither @xmath117- nor @xmath118-graded but that it is @xmath119- and @xmath120-graded .",
    "we can additionally use the latter to obtain a filtration of @xmath121 . to that end , let @xmath122 denote those elements of @xmath121 whose total degree is greater than or equal to @xmath68 .",

    "6.2.1 ) .",
    "essential for the fedosov construction are then the following operators on @xmath106 @xmath128 where @xmath40 is any torsion - free , symplectic connection on @xmath19 .",

    "of course , in this very brief discourse we omitted numerous details , which are however fully displayed in @xcite , see also @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.4 ) . as a final remark",
    "let us briefly note that the construction obviously depends on the choice of the torsion - free , symplectic connection @xmath40 .",
    "however , as mentioned in the previous section , we fix one such connection and will mostly omit any explicit mention .    instead ,",
    "let us focus on another aspect of the fedosov construction , namely on it s connection with symmetries in the form of representations of a lie algebra @xmath17 on @xmath49 .",

    "we will firstly employ two results from @xcite that will guarantee that our classes are in fact well defined :    [ thm : class_qham_cocycle ] a @xmath17-invariant fedosov star product for @xmath36 obtained from @xmath229 admits a quantum hamiltonian if and only if there is an element @xmath69 such that @xmath238 for all @xmath226",
    ". we then have @xmath239 .    note that since quantum hamiltonians for the same star product differ only by an element in @xmath240 , holds for every quantum hamiltonian of @xmath155 .",
    "the second result from @xcite is the following consequence :    [ corollary : class_qmom_cocycle ] let @xmath155 be a @xmath17-invariant fedosov star product constructed from @xmath229 .",

    "however , we will only use the above results in the following capacity , namely to show that first , any quantum momentum map @xmath25 is an element of @xmath244 . for this",

    "indeed , @xmath248 using this observation we can restate the above condition on the existence of a quantum momentum map as follows : there exists a quantum momentum map iff there exists a map @xmath25 such that @xmath249 and @xmath250 , i.e. @xmath251 extends to an equivariant two - cocycle .",

    "consequently the self - equivalence @xmath261 is well defined : on sufficiently small open subsets @xmath262 we have @xmath263 .",
    "hence we can calculate locally @xmath264 for all @xmath265 .",
    "this allows to compute @xmath266 for the second part , assume that there is a @xmath17-invariant self - equivalence @xmath252 of @xmath1 with @xmath253 .",

    "is then the specialization of those to equivariant star products .",
    "however , there are slightly stronger results for the two previously known cases , namely there are bijections @xmath291 and @xmath292 , respectively , between equivalence classes of star products ( invariant star products ) to the second de rham ( invariant de rham ) cohomology which is defined on fedosov star products by @xmath293 \\in      \\frac{[\\omega]}{{\\nu } } + \\hdr(m){\\llbracket { \\nu}\\rrbracket}\\qquad      \\textrm{and }      \\qquad      c{^{\\mathrm{inv}}}({\\star}_\\omega )      =      \\frac{1}{{\\nu } } [ \\omega + \\omega]{^{\\mathrm{inv}}}\\in \\frac{[\\omega]{^{\\mathrm{inv}}}}{{\\nu } } + \\hdr{^{\\mathrm{inv}}}(m){\\llbracket { \\nu}\\rrbracket},\\ ] ] respectively , and extended to all star products by the fact that every star product ( invariant star product ) is equivalent ( invariantly equivalent ) to a fedosov star product ( invariant fedosov star product ) .",
    "the aforementioned relative class is then precisely the difference of the images of those maps ( up to a normalization factor ) , i.e. @xmath294 in the following , we will similarly define a bijection @xmath295{_\\lie{g}}+ { \\mathrm{h}{_\\lie{g}}}(m){\\llbracket { \\nu}\\rrbracket}$ ] from the equivalence classes of equivariant star products to the equivariant cohomology .",
    "in view of the classification result it is tempting to define the class simply by taking the equivariant class of @xmath157 and @xmath25 .",
    "however , it is not completely obvious that this is only depending of @xmath1 and @xmath25 as we have to control the behaviour of @xmath25 under invariant self - equivalences .",
    "nevertheless , with the previous results this turns out to be correct .",
    "hence we can state the following definition :    [ def : char_class ] let @xmath155 be the fedosov star product constructed from @xmath139 and @xmath25 a quantum momentum map of @xmath155 .",

    ", we first cite a result from @xcite stating that for every @xmath17-invariant star product @xmath1 there is a @xmath17-invariant equivalence @xmath28 to a @xmath17-invariant fedosov star product @xmath155 . given a quantum momentum map @xmath25 of @xmath1 we can use @xmath28 to assign the equivariant class @xmath302 to the pair @xmath26 .",
