    "off - diagonal ( or skewed ) parton distributions provide important information about the nonperturbartive structure of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "they can in principle be measured in such processes as deeply virtual compton scattering , diffractive vector meson production or diffractive high-@xmath0 jet production .",
    "just as for the ordinary ( diagonal ) parton distributions , the qcd evolution equations @xcite play an important role in the determination of skewed parton distributions . as usual input distributions are required .",
    "however , this is more complicated than in the diagonal case since the skewed parton distributions depend on additional variable  the asymmetry parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we use the symmetric formulation of ji @xcite in which the skewed parton distributions are given by functions @xmath2 with support @xmath3 , see @xcite for more details . here",
    "we discuss various ways to specify the initial conditions and show how the differences in the input distributions disappear on evolution .",
    "in particular we illustrate the conclusion of @xcite that the skewed distributions @xmath2 , at small @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are fixed by the conventional diagonal partons .",
    "the distributions @xmath6 have to fulfil several conditions with respect to the variable @xmath5 .",
    "first , the time - reversal invariance and hermiticity impose the condition @xcite @xmath7 thus @xmath6 is an even function of @xmath5 .",
    "the second condition states that in the limit @xmath8 we recover the ordinary diagonal parton distributions @xmath9 the third condition is more complicated but has a simple origin , @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 moment of @xmath6 is a polynomial in @xmath5 of the order @xmath11 at most @xmath12}\\;a_{n , i}\\;\\xi^{2i}\\ , ,   \\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] which also embodies condition ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "finally we impose continuity of @xmath6 at the border @xmath13 between two different physical regions , see @xcite .",
    "this ensures that the amplitude of a physical process , described by skewed distributions , is finite .",
    "all these conditions have to be fulfilled in the construction of the input for evolution .",
    "they are , of course , conserved during the evolution .",
    "there are two equivalent ways to evolve @xmath14 up in the scale @xmath15 . the first method , which is most appropriate at small @xmath16 , uses the evolution of the gegenbauer moments of @xmath6 and the shuvaev transform @xcite to find the final answer in the @xmath17space @xcite . in the second method the solutions",
    "are found after imposing initial conditions and numerically solving the evolution equations , directly in the @xmath17space .",
    "here we supplement the studies of @xcite by presenting results from the second approach .",
    "condition ( [ eq:4 ] ) is difficult to fulfil in order to specify initial distributions at a certain scale @xmath18 .",
    "it may be facilitated by the use of the double distribution @xmath19 @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the square @xmath22 this prescription introduces a nontrivial mixing between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . condition ( [ eq:2 ] )",
    "is guaranteed if @xmath23 .",
    "we still have freedom to add to ( [ eq:5 ] ) a function @xmath24 , antisymmetric in @xmath25 , contained entirely in the erbl - like region @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the only problem left is to build in the ordinary diagonal distributions in the prescription ( [ eq:5 ] ) . to do this",
    "we take @xmath27 where different choices of @xmath28 give , via ( [ eq:5 ] ) , different initial conditions for @xmath29 .",
    "three choices , @xmath30 are shown in fig .  1 , with @xmath31 given by grv @xcite at @xmath32 .",
    "the first choice gives simply the diagonal input @xmath33 , independent of @xmath5 .",
    "the second , with @xmath34 for quarks ( gluons ) , generates an input form similar to that obtained from the model of @xcite in which the gegenbauer moments of @xmath6 are @xmath5-independent .",
    "this property is conserved by the evolution .",
    "the exact form of the double distribution in this case can be found in @xcite .",
    "the last choice was selected so as to give an oscillatory input behaviour in the erbl - like region .",
    "fig .  1 shows the quark non - singlet , quark singlet and gluon skewed distributions for the three input models evolved up in @xmath15 for @xmath35 .",
    "the results for larger values of @xmath5 are qualitatively the same @xcite .",
    "we see that the form of @xmath36 has the most influence in the erbl region .",
    "however even in this region evolution soon washes out the differences . already by @xmath37",
    "gev@xmath38 the three curves are close to each other . in the dglap region , @xmath39 ,",
    "the curves are almost identical while in the erbl region , @xmath26 , they approach the asymptotic form for each particular skewed parton distribution .",
    "such behaviour is especially important in view of the fact that one set of the curves is obtained from the pure diagonal input parton distributions . in this way",
    "we illustrate the result presented in @xcite that to a good accuracy at small @xmath5 , the skewed distributions @xmath40 are completely known in terms of conventional partons .",
    "thus , to summarize , the nonperturbative information contained in the diagonal input parton distributions and particular features of the evolution equations for skewed parton distributions are sufficient for their determination .",
