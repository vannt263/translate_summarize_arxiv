    "in optical radiometry primary standards are based on absolute sources or detectors @xcite .",
    "synchrotron and blackbody radiators are absolute sources .",
    "the relative uncertainty of both these sources is about 1 part in @xmath0 . among the absolute detectors , there",
    "exist the following two types : electrical substitution radiometers ( esr ) based on thermal effects , and semiconductor photon detectors .",
    "uncertainties of a few parts in @xmath1 appear to be the limit of these techniques .",
    "however , such a high accuracy of traditional calibration methods is reached only for an appropriate choice of wavelength and special types of detectors .",
    "recently the use of photons produced by means of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) , where photons are emitted in pairs strongly correlated in direction , wavelength and polarization , has been exploited for the absolute calibration of detectors in photon - counting mode @xcite .",
    "this absolute technique is becoming attractive for national metrology institutes to realize absolute radiometric standards .",
    "in fact it relies simply on the counting of events , involves a remarkably small number of measured quantities , and does not require any reference standards .    because of the success of the spdc scheme for calibrating single - photon detectors",
    ", it is important to analyze the possibility to extend this technique to higher photon fluxes for calibrating analog detectors .",
    "a seminal attempt in this sense was made in @xcite following the theoretical proposal of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these results were limited to the case of very low photon flux ( as we will show later ) .    in this paper",
    "we report our systematic analysis of the measurement method for increasing photon flux produced by means of spdc , showing how to estimate the quantum efficiency in a real analog regime .",
    "furthermore , we point out the intrinsic limitation of spdc for calibration when one moves towards fluxes requiring large parametric gain .",
    "thus , the stimulated parametric down conversion ( pdc ) is considered as an alternative bright source of correlated beams and we demonstrate that , under some opportune conditions , the quantum efficiency can be estimated in this new regime .",
    "the scheme for calibrating photon detectors by using parametric down conversion is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "it is based on the specific properties of this process , where a photon of the pump beam ( usually a laser beam ) `` decays '' inside a non - linear crystal into two lower - frequency photons , 1 and 2 , such that energy and momentum are conserved ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "moreover , the two photons are emitted within a coherence time @xmath4 of tens of femtoseconds from each other .",
    "the process can be spontaneous ( spdc ) when no modes of radiation except the pump modes are injected through the input face of the crystal .",
    "if a seed mode @xmath5 is injected , its presence stimulates the process and many more photons of the pump are converted .",
    "in essence , the calibration procedure consists of placing a couple of detectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 down - stream from the nonlinear crystal , along the directions of propagation of correlated photon pairs for a selected pair of frequencies .",
    "since the incident photon fluxes @xmath8 and @xmath9 are correlated within @xmath10 s , the fluctuations of the registered currents @xmath11 and @xmath12 are suppose to be strictly correlated .",
    "the non ideal quantum efficiency of the detectors makes some photons missed sometimes by @xmath6 sometimes by @xmath7 , spoiling the correlation . the techniques for estimating the quantum efficiency , both in counting and in analog regime , consist in measuring this effect .",
    "in the following the photodetection process in the analog regime will be modelled as a random pulse train @xcite    @xmath13    i.e. a very large number of discrete events at random times of occurrence @xmath14 .",
    "the pulse shape @xmath15 is determined by the transit time of charge carriers .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 is a fixed function with the characteristic width @xmath16 and a unit area ( @xmath15 has dimension @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath18 ns represents a typical value in analog detection .",
    "the pulse amplitude @xmath19 is a random variable representing the electron charge produced in the @xmath20-th event , in order to account for a possible current gain by avalanche multiplication .",
    "the statistical nature of the multiplication process gives an additional contribution to the current fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in an ideal instantaneous photocell response , without avalanche gain , all values @xmath19 are equal to the charge @xmath21 of a single electron and @xmath22 . in the case of ideal quantum efficiency , since the probability density of photo - detection at time @xmath23 at detector @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is related to the quantum mean value @xmath26 of the photon flux ( photons per second ) , we calculate the average current output of @xmath24 as ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath27 where the factor @xmath28 is the average charge produced in a detection event .",
    "we have assumed the response function for the two detectors to be the same , @xmath29 .",
    "now we introduce the quantum efficiency @xmath30 of detector @xmath24 , defined as the number of pulses generated per incident photon . in @xcite a real detector is modelled with an ideal one ( @xmath31 ) preceded by a beam splitter with transmission coefficient equal to the quantum efficiency of the real detector @xcite .",
    "following the results reported there we can perform in eq .",
    "( [ curr ] ) the substitution @xmath32 .",
    "thus , being @xmath33 time independent , we obtain : @xmath34 the auto - correlation and the cross - correlation functions for the currents can be expressed as    @xmath35    respectively for @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the auto - correlation function of the photon flux at detector @xmath38 , and for @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the cross - correlation between the fluxes incident at the two different detectors .",
    "the functions @xmath41 and @xmath40 are evaluated in @xcite for spdc . as mentioned above",
    ", the resolving time of a real analog detector is finite , and in general can be considered much larger than the spdc coherence time . thus any fluctuations in the intensity of light are integrated over @xmath16 during the detection process . in the limit of @xmath42 ,",
    "for @xmath43 and @xmath44 we have    @xmath45,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath46\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have introduced the convolution of the response function of detectors @xmath47 . the term",
    "@xmath48 depends on the second power of the parametric gain @xmath49 , i.e. the mean number of photons per mode of the radiation . for our purposes we can estimate approximatively @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the eqs ( [ self - corr - curr2 ] ) and ( [ cross- corr - curr2 ] ) are the fundamental tools for studying the problem of absolute calibration of analog detectors and thus we are going to discuss them in detail .",
    "despite they seem to be quite symmetric , we observe an important difference .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath51 in the autocorrelation function is the shot noise contribution and for this reason the quantum efficiency @xmath52 enters linearly , while in the current cross - correlation function the corresponding term is due to the high quantum correlation between the signal and idler beams of pdc and the quantum efficiency appears quadratically .",
    "its presence is the key for absolute calibration .",
    "the term @xmath48 both for auto- and cross - correlation functions , can be neglected as long as @xmath53 , i.e. , the mean number of photons per mode is much smaller than one . however ,",
    "if the duration of the photocurrent pulse is much longer than the coherence time , this assumption does not prevent photodetection being in a strongly analog regime , because a lot of photons can be absorbed during the pulse duration generating overlapping of pulses [ see eq ( [ curr ] ) ] .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath54 is due to the presence of more than one photon within a time interval @xmath16 and for that reason is more delicate .",
    "it can be neglected in eqs .",
    "( [ self - corr - curr2 ] ) and ( [ cross- corr - curr2 ] ) only if @xmath55 .",
    "since the pulse @xmath15 has a height around @xmath56 , @xmath57=\\mathcal{f}(0)\\sim 1/\\tau_{p}$ ] .",
    "so the condition becomes @xmath58 , i.e. , the number of incident photons during the resolving time of the detector should be much less than one , i.e. one should work in a non - overlapping regime .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to distinguish among three different regimes :    * ( i ) * @xmath58 ( i.e. photocurrent pulses do not overlap on the average ) . for a detector with a time constant @xmath59 ns",
    ", the corresponding photon flux must be below @xmath60 photons / s , which , for a wavelength of @xmath61 nm , means a power of tens of pw . from ( [ self - corr - curr2 ] ) and ( [ cross- corr - curr2 ] ) , neglecting @xmath48 and the terms in @xmath62 one obtains a formula for the estimation of quantum efficiency like the one reported in @xcite .",
    "however , this regime does not appear interesting because of the necessity to work only at very low intensity , where no overlapping between pulses happens . in principle",
    ", one could distinguish between different pulses of the current and work in the counting mode provided the amplitude @xmath19 of each pulse is large enough to be detectable .",
    "* ( ii ) * @xmath63 but still @xmath53 ( i.e. , photocurrent pulses overlap but the parametric gain and photon flux are still quite low ) . by considering the same parameters as used in case i , coherence time @xmath4 of the order of @xmath64 fs , and the requirement that @xmath65 , this means a photon flux up to @xmath66 photons / s , i.e. a power of few nw . here",
    ", only the term @xmath48 can be neglected in eqs .",
    "( [ self - corr - curr2 ] ) and ( [ cross- corr - curr2 ] ) . defining the current functions as @xmath67 ,",
    "the analog quantum efficiency can be estimated as : @xmath68 unfortunately it is not satisfying from the metrology point of view because of the presence of an unknown parameter @xmath69 related to the statistics of charge fluctuations and that has to be estimated independently in some other way .",
    "we suggest to avoid the problem by integrating eq .",
    "( [ cross- corr - curr2 ] ) over time @xmath70 .",
    "it correspond to evaluate the power spectrum of the fluctuations at frequencies around zero , namely much smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "we would like to stress that in this case , the assumption @xmath29 is not necessary . since @xmath71 , integrating eq .",
    "( [ cross- corr - curr2 ] ) in @xmath70 and dividing by the current [ see eq ( [ curr - time ] ) ] , we obtain @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the electron charge produced per single incident photon , or , according to formula ( [ curr - time ] ) , the ratio between the current and the photon flux .",
    "( [ eta - klyshko - integ - mi ] ) represents one of the main results of the paper , since it shows that the absolute calibration of analog detectors by using spdc is indeed possible .    *",
    "( iii ) * @xmath74 ( fluxes larger than @xmath66 photons / s ) . in this regime",
    "each term of ( [ self - corr - curr2 ] ) and ( [ cross- corr - curr2 ] ) is important and no simple way can be found for the absolute calibration with spdc .",
    "it can be shown that in this case one should be able to collect exactly the same number of correlated modes by @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "since spdc takes place with a very large spectral and spatial bandwidth , it would require accurate and well balanced spatial and frequency selection .",
    "this could originate systematic errors which are difficult to be evaluated .",
    "we overcome the problem of calibration for photon fluxes larger than @xmath66 , highlighted in point ( iii ) , exploring the possibility of using a parametric amplifier configuration , where a seed coherent beam with power @xmath75 is injected along direction 2 stimulating the bright emission of the two correlated beams . in this case",
    "the photon fluxes can be increased by varying the power @xmath75 of the coherent seed beam , without increasing @xmath49 ( we can lead back to the condition @xmath76 ) . introducing the proper expression for the fluxes in the stimulated emission in ( [ curr - time ] ) , under the condition that the spontaneous emission is negligible we have @xmath77 where the subscript @xmath78 reminds that here the currents are calculated for the stimulated pdc .",
    "( [ cross - corr - curr ] ) the correlation functions of the current fluctuations can be expressed in a simple form , under the assumption of @xmath76 :    @xmath79    the quantum efficiency can be evaluated as @xmath80    alternatively , integrating in @xmath70 the expression for the cross - correlation we have @xmath81 in which the avalanche gain factor disappears .",
    "there are two main advantages of using the stimulated pdc .",
    "first of all we are not up - limited in the photon fluxes that we can use .",
    "considering detector without internal gain where the johnson noise in the amplification process is predominant , it is important to obtain a good signal to noise ratio by increasing the signal .",
    "we stress that in our case the signal is of the order of the shot noise !",
    "a second advantage lies in the very narrow bandwidth , both in space and frequency of the stimulated emission , that is the one of the coherent seed beam .",
    "this makes easier to collect the correlated beams resulting in two bright spots in the detection plane .",
    "the calculation of the expected uncertainties in the evaluation of the correlations functions depends on the measurement technique . here",
    "we consider a measurement process in which the two current outputs of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are combined by an analog multiplier and the result is integrated for a time @xmath82 much larger than the response time @xmath16 .",
    "the general calculation of the variance of this quantity would require the knowledge of the fourth - order quantum correlation functions of the photon fluxes which are rather complex .",
    "therefore we used the approximation of small fluctuations , i.e. @xmath83 , which perfectly fits the regime of strong overlapping discussed in the previous section . in this case one obtains , both for the auto- and cross - correlation , a maximal uncertainty    @xmath84    considering equation ( [ eta - klyshko - mi ] ) for a detector without avalanche gain , following the uncertainty propagation rule , we obtain the relative uncertainty on the quantum efficiency as    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the number of photons detected during the detector response time .",
    "the uncertainty scales with the square root of the measurement time @xmath82 .",
    "for example , if @xmath87 s , it is lower than one part in @xmath88 .",
    "since , as we are going to discuss , this term is not the dominant one this estimate suffices for our purposes .",
    "the noise contributions from the detector ( dark current , noise of the transimpedance amplifier ) and background light are supposed to be statistically independent of each other and of the photocurrents produced by spdc light in the two detectors .",
    "thus , they do not give any contribution to the cross correlation function of the two current fluctuations in the numerator of ( [ eta - klyshko - mi ] ) .",
    "in the denominator of the same equation , containing the autocorrelation of the current fluctuations , their effect should be measured ( for example , rotating by @xmath89 the polarization of the laser pump , to eliminate the spdc signal ) , and subtracted .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of this measurement can be kept so small that it does not increase significantly the total relative uncertainty given above .",
    "the main systematic contribution is due to the non linear crystal optical losses .",
    "the uncertainty in its measurement could be reduced to few parts in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is the dominant contribution to the uncertainty budget , largely exceeding the statistical one .",
    "motivated by the necessity of a general absolute calibration scheme for detectors for various applications , we have performed a systematic study on the possibility of applying pdc calibration methods to the analog regime .",
    "our results show that the measurement of correlations between detector output currents can indeed be used to extend the absolute calibration method to the analog regime .",
    "in particular , it is shown that integration of the photocurrent correlation functions in time allows one to avoid the measurement of the photocurrent pulse shape and to eliminate the necessity to know the statistics of the internal gain of the detector .",
    "also , our analysis shows that is possible to go beyond the regime of non - overlapping photocurrent pulses , which was used in earlier works , and to move on to higher intensities .",
    "furthermore , the stimulated operating mode of pdc has been considered with promising perspectives .",
    "a preliminary theoretical uncertainty analysis gives a relative value around @xmath88 , mainly due to the measurement uncertainty of the optical loss in the crystal , which is interesting from a metrology view - point .",
