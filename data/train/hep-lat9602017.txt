    "continuum interpolations of lattice gauge fields have been considered in the literature as a way of relating the topological aspects of continuum gauge theory to lattice gauge theory , and as an intermediate step in coupling lattice gauge fields to fermions in a manner that preserves chiral symmetry @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "recently , we have proposed a method for defining and simulating chiral gauge theories , with gauge fields on a coarse lattice coupled to fermions on a finer lattice via an interpolated gauge field @xcite .",

    "the interpolation procedure we advocated was adapted from t hooft s recent suggestion @xcite in the context of vector - like gauge theories .",

    "a different global coordinate frame obtained by a rotation would produce a different @xmath38 , but it is easy to explicitly construct a gauge transformation that relates it to the old @xmath38 .",

    "now let us consider a 3-dimensional sublattice of the 4-dimensional lattice . unlike 2-dimensions , in 3-dimensions ( and higher ) , referring to the global coordinate system in constructing @xmath38 will break rotational covariance . to remedy this",

    "the test is then to see if the fermions coupled to the gauge field become free chiral fermions at @xmath161 in the continuum limit ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to see how this works in our formulation of lattice chiral gauge theory @xcite . in our interpolation procedure , it is straightforward to verify that in the special case @xmath164 everywhere , the interpolation is just @xmath165 everywhere .",
    "so by property ( iii ) of gauge covariance , when @xmath8 is pure gauge , the interpolation is a transversely continuous gauge field which is pure gauge . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that in our continuum limit the fermions are gauge - invariantly coupled to transversely continuous gauge field interpolations .",
    "in particular therefore , when the interpolation is pure gauge the fermions are free .",
