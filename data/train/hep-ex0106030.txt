    "the square of the momentum transfer ( @xmath5 ) in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) can reach several times @xmath6 , which means that the structure of the proton is probed with a wavelength as small as one thousandth ( @xmath7  cm ) of its radius .    during the years 1994 - 2000 , each of the two collider experiments , h1 and",
    "zeus , has collected approximately 110  @xmath8 of @xmath9 and 15  @xmath8 of @xmath10 data . with these data ,",
    "the experiments are sensitive to rare processes with a cross section of a fraction of a picobarn , and searches for exotic signals of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) are extensively performed .",
    "possible signals of new physics include :    * resonant states formed by electron - quark fusion . examples of such states are leptoquarks or squarks ( superpartners of quarks ) in supersymmetry ( susy ) with @xmath0-parity violation .",
    "on - shell production of such particles is possible for those with masses up to @xmath4 . *",
    "physics at a much higher energy scale than the hera energy could cause a virtual effect in electron - proton scattering in the highest-@xmath5 domain .",
    "such an effect is modeled as an effective four - fermion ( @xmath11 ) contact interaction .",
    "a variant of such a phenomenon is a lepton - flavor - violating ( lfv ) interaction in which the incoming electron changes its flavor to one of the higher - generation leptons ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) . *",
    "if the fermions ( leptons and/or quarks ) are composite rather than elementary , excited states of fermions could be produced as a consequence of the large momentum transfer , if the masses of such states are below the hera @xmath4 .",
    "such excited fermions could decay back to the ground state ( normal fermions ) `` radiatively '' by emitting a gauge boson ( @xmath3 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 or gluon ) .    in the following sections ,",
    "recent results are presented from both collaborations on these topics .",
    "most of the results are preliminary .",
    "leptoquarks ( lqs ) are particles which carry both lepton ( l ) and baryon ( b ) numbers .",
    "they appear in many unifying theories which try to establish fundamental relations between leptons and quarks .",
    "if lqs with a mass below the @xmath4 of hera exist , they could be directly produced via a fusion between the electron and a quark in the proton .",
    "the production cross section depends on the unknown yukawa coupling @xmath16 at the lq - electron - quark vertex . to evaluate the experimental results , the theoretical framework of buchmller - rckl - wyler ( brw)@xcite is often used . in this framework , lqs decay to an electron - quark pair with a fixed branching ratio of either 1/2 or 1 , depending on the lq species .",
    "the only other possible decay mode is into a neutrino - quark pair .",
    "when the lq decays to an electron - quark pair , the final state is identical to sm neutral current ( nc ) dis .",
    "however , the angular distribution is different .",
    "nc dis with @xmath1-channel photon exchange has a @xmath17 angular distribution , where @xmath18 is the inelasticity variable related to the electron decay angle in the @xmath19-@xmath20 rest frame , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . on the other hand , scalar lqs have flat @xmath18 distribution and vector lqs have @xmath23 dependence .",
    "therefore , a cut in @xmath18 ( or @xmath24 ) is used to enhance the lq signal among the nc dis background .",
    "figure  [ h1lq ] shows the mass distribution of nc dis candidates from the h1 experiment .",
    "there was an excess of events after a @xmath18 cut in the old @xmath9 data@xcite , which is not confirmed by the new @xmath9 data taken at higher @xmath4@xcite .",
    "zeus also had a small excess in the high-@xmath25 , high-@xmath18 region ( @xmath25 is the bjorken scaling variable , related to the mass of the @xmath26 system via @xmath27=@xmath28 ) in the old data , which also is not confirmed by the new data@xcite . with the smaller amount of @xmath10 data already analyzed ,",
    "both experiments have observed good agreement with sm predictions@xcite .    with no evidence of a signal ,",
    "limits are derived on the yukawa coupling as a function of the lq mass , as shown in fig .",
    "[ feq2lim ] .",
    "note that @xmath9 and @xmath10 data have complementary sensitivity to different lq species ; @xmath9 collisions mainly probe the production of @xmath29=0 lqs , which couple to a positron and a valence quark ( @xmath29 is the fermion number , defined as @xmath29=@xmath30 + 3@xmath31 ) , and correspondingly @xmath10 for @xmath29=2 . in the figure ,",
    "comparison is made with other collider results . at the tevatron",
    ", lqs can be pair - produced and thus the limit on mass is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "the limits from lep come from hadronic cross section measurements in which lq exchange can produce virtual effects .",
    "one can also consider a general case and treat the lq branching ratio to @xmath26 as a free parameter , in contrast to the restrictions of the brw framework . in fig .",
    "[ zeusnujet ] , the search results in both nc ( electron - jet resonance ) and cc ( neutrino - jet resonance ) channels are used , and combined limits are obtained assuming the branching ratios to @xmath26 and @xmath32 decays sum up to one@xcite .",
    "the limits in lq mass for fixed values of @xmath16 are largely independent of how the branching ratios are shared , while the tevatron limits degrade largely when the lq predominantly decays to @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath0-parity is a multiplicative quantum number defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the spin of the particle .",
    "it takes the value @xmath35 for usual particles and @xmath36 for their superpartners . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , @xmath0-parity",
    "is assumed to be conserved .",
    "the consequences are that superparticles are always produced in pairs , and that the lightest superparticle is stable .",
    "however , the general supersymmetric and gauge - invariant superpotential contains three terms which violate @xmath0-parity , two with @xmath30 violation and one with @xmath31 violation@xcite .",
    "of particular interest at hera is the term @xmath37 , where @xmath30 and @xmath38 are left - handed lepton and quark doublet superfields and @xmath39 is a right - handed singlet superfield of down - type quarks .",
    "the indices @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote their generation . for each generation combination ,",
    "a new yukawa coupling @xmath43 is introduced .    with a presence of non - zero @xmath44 , production of squarks",
    "is possible in @xmath26 fusion at hera , in exact analogy to the scalar lq production described before .",
    "however , the decay mode of the squark has more varieties than lq decays in the brw framework .",
    "in addition to the @xmath26 decay , a squark can decay to a quark and a gaugino with @xmath0-conserving gauge couplings .",
    "the gauginos can decay to a lepton ( @xmath19 or @xmath45 ) and two quarks with the same @xmath43 coupling , or to a lighter gaugino and two fermions with gauge couplings which results in further cascade decays . as a consequence , there are many multi - jet and/or multi - lepton final states with possible missing momentum , which compete with the simple lq - like decays .",
    "it is worth noting that both @xmath46 and @xmath47 final states are possible in the gaugino decay to @xmath48 , which makes possible a `` wrong sign '' electron search with respect to the charge of the beam electron , a channel with very little background from sm processes .",
    "both h1 and zeus experiments have analyzed the @xmath9 data taken during 1994 - 97 ( approx .",
    "40  @xmath8 per experiment ) in many decay channels , and no evidence of squark production was found .",
    "the results can then be converted to constraints in susy parameter space under various scenarios .",

    "for reasonably large values of the yukawa coupling ( even as small as 0.1 ) , hera has a sensitivity in a region not explored at the tevatron , although it should be mentioned that the tevatron limits are independent of @xmath43 .",
    "new physics at an energy scale which is much larger than the @xmath4 of hera could also be detected via its virtual effects at the highest-@xmath5 region ( @xmath54 several @xmath55  gev@xmath56 ) which corresponds to an @xmath19-@xmath20 interaction at a distance as short as 0.001  fm .",
    "such new physics processes are modeled in their low - energy limit as an effective four - fermion contact interaction ( ci ) , and the effects are parameterized by a coupling constant , @xmath57 , and an effective mass scale , @xmath58 .",
    "both collaborations@xcite tested the most common @xmath11 ci models using the nc dis data at high @xmath5 .",
    "since the data are well described by the sm within statistical errors , limits are derived for each model tested .",
    "the limit on @xmath58 depends on the chiral structure of the model , and ranges up to 9  tev when taking the usual coupling convention @xmath59=@xmath60 .",
    "the hera limits are competitive and complementary to those from lep and the tevatron , where the tests are made in @xmath61hadrons and drell - yan production , respectively .",
    "limits are also set on some specific models . in models with large ( compactified ) extra dimensions in which only the gravitational force can propagate to the extra dimensions",
    ", the fundamental planck mass scale could be as low as the electroweak scale ( @xmath62 tev)@xcite .",
    "in such models , high - energy particle collisions get additional contributions due to the exchange of a kaluza - klein tower of gravitons which modify the cross sections at the highest energies .",
    "this causes ci - like effects at hera in the highest-@xmath5 region with a main contribution from the interference of graviton exchange and normal nc exchange .",
    "these effects are characterized by an effective coupling @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is close to the fundamental planck scale and @xmath65 determines whether the interference is constructive or destructive .",

    "hera is well suited for searching for electron - muon or electron - tau lfv processes by colliding an electron with a proton at a very short distance .",
    "the final state will be an @xmath71 event which has a striking signature of a high - momentum muon or tau balanced by a hadronic system , which has very little background from sm processes .    both experiments searched for such events in the 1994 - 97 data , with no candidates@xcite .",

    "it should be noted that @xmath10 collisions provide a much larger cross section for excited - neutrino production than @xmath9 because of the larger @xmath2-quark density in the proton and the helicity suppression in @xmath9 due to @xmath14-exchange .",

    "the limits come from a single - top search @xmath96 and the tevatron limits are from a rare top decay search @xmath97 .",
    "both processes can constrain the @xmath3 and @xmath15 couplings , and the limits apply to both @xmath2 and @xmath95 quarks since they are in the final state . at hera , the contribution from @xmath15-exchange in the @xmath1-channel is suppressed due to the large mass in the propagator , so the cross section is dominated by the photon coupling @xmath93 . moreover , since the @xmath2 quark dominates the parton distribution in the proton at large @xmath25 , hera is most sensitive to the @xmath98 coupling . it can be seen that the hera limits on @xmath99 are more stringent than those from lep and the tevatron .",
    "note that the cross section dependence on the top mass uncertainty ( 5  gev ) is about 20% at hera@xcite , while it is larger at lep where the available energy is close to the threshold .",
    "during the `` hera 1 '' running , both h1 and zeus experiments collected about 110  pb@xmath100 of @xmath9 and 15  pb@xmath100 of @xmath10 data .",
    "not all of the searches have finished analyzing all of the data yet , but so far no evidence for new physics has been observed .",

    "limits are comparable and largely complementary to those obtained in searches at lep or the tevatron .",
    "the excess of isolated leptons in the h1 data is intriguing , although the zeus results from the total data sample are consistent with sm expectations .",
    "limits on single - top production yield the most stringent constraint on the fcnc coupling at the @xmath98 vertex .",
    "hera and both experiments have been performing shutdown work since september 2000 for the luminosity upgrade .",
    "new focusing magnets are installed very close to the interaction point , even inside the detectors .",
    "the new optics , together with a moderate increase in beam currents , will bring a five - fold increase in the instantaneous luminosity compared to the year 2000 running .",
    "in addition the detectors will be upgraded ; for example , zeus will have a micro - vertex detector for the first time . from summer 2001 , the machine will restart and physics running is scheduled from december . in the five - year program of `` hera 2 '' running , approximately 1  fb@xmath100 of data are expected per experiment .",
    "another notable feature of the new running is that the longitudinal polarization of the electron / positron beam will be available by default to the collider experiments .    in these five years ,",
    "hera 2 and tevatron run ii will be the only energy - frontier machines in operation",
    ". they will compete in many physics scenarios .",
    "for example , leptoquark ( or squark ) sensitivity is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ perez]@xcite .",
    "if the yukawa coupling @xmath16 is within the sensitivity of hera , and if hera 2 quickly starts up with high - luminosity running , there is a chance for discovery with 10 times more data to come . otherwise , for the case of leptoquarks decaying 100% to @xmath26 , with 1 - 2  fb@xmath100 of run ii data the tevatron experiments can close the discovery window for direct observation at hera since the @xmath16-independent mass limit will exceed the hera kinematic limit .",
    "however , there are cases where hera has still potential not covered by run ii ; as indicated in the figure , in the case of leptoquarks with a small branching ratio to @xmath26 , hera s sensitivity exceeds that of run ii even for fairly small yukawa coupling . also there are some models",
    "not probed extensively at the tevatron such as excited leptons .",
    "therefore , the two colliders will continue to be competitive and complementary during the coming years before the start of lhc , in the hunt for possible excitement .",
