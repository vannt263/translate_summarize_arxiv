    "this physical picture is not exact due to the finite lattice spacing .",

[ hidro ] does not allow to probe fluctuations .",

    "below we shall focus on the variance of the total current @xmath46 .",
    "let us define the left , right and total magnetization as follows : @xmath47 the variance of the integrated current is equal to the variance of the left ( right ) magnetization : @xmath48 since the total magnetization is conserved and the initial state is an @xmath49 eigenstate , the fluctuation of @xmath49 remains zero for any time @xmath23 @xmath50 by exploiting this property we can rewrite ( [ egy ] ) as @xmath51    before presenting an exact calculation we provide a back - of - the - envelope derivation of our main result .",

    "this argument remains valid for a more general class of initial conditions , where on the left ( right ) half of the chain the fermions are filled up to the fermi energy @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) . in this case , the asymptotic state  which builds up near the origin  includes fermions with momenta varying from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the fermi momenta corresponding to @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "the reason for this choice of upper limit is that the front and the whole profile `` moves '' linearly with time , hence the cutoff must behave similarly .",

    "we have argued that this logarithmic leading order behavior remains unchanged for a more general class of initial conditions ( where the magnetization on the two half - chains is not saturated ) .",

    "current fluctuations were found to be asymptotically gaussian @xcite and therefore the variance provides a complete characterization of the full current statistics . moreover , according to @xcite this indicates that the entanglement ( between the left and right halves ) is simply proportional to the variance of the current ( with a factor @xmath133 ) . in order to check this relation",
    "we compared our results for @xmath52 to numerical results for the time dependent entanglement entropy ( for the same model and initial condition ) presented in fig .",
