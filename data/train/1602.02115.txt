    "the drao  st  is an array of seven approximately 8.6  m antennas along an east - west baseline .",
    "a full synthesis contains data from baselines ( antenna separations ) in multiples of @xmath46  m from @xmath47 ( @xmath48  m ) to @xmath49 ( @xmath50  m ) and takes 144 hours of observing time ( @xmath51  h @xmath52 12 antenna configurations ) .",
    "we note that while there are 21 baselines from 7 antennas , for  data the s21 correlator forms only those baseline products needed for complete sampling of the fourier plane , the 12 combinations involving a fixed and a movable antenna @xcite ; other combinations produce baselines that are redundant . for a field at declination @xmath53 this sampling in the fourier domain results in a synthesized beam of @xmath54 at 1420 mhz @xcite .    for diffuse  emission such as studied here , with structure on all scales , the presence of sidelobes in the dirty synthesized beam can both affect the fidelity of the image and reduce its sensitivity . to suppress the sidelobes a gaussian taper",
    "is applied in the fourier domain , attenuating the visibilities for the maximum baseline by 20% .",
    "away from the main lobe the response of the synthesized beam falls below 0.5% everywhere in the field of view used ( radius 93 ) and is typically more than an order of magnitude less ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this tapering results in a final beam of about @xmath55 . to ensure proper sampling , maps from single syntheses are on grids with a pixel separation of 21875 while final dhigls  mosaicked products are on grids with a pixel separation of 18 .    in this paper , velocities are relative to the local standard of rest ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the spectrometer has 256-channels and the coverage was centered on @xmath57 with @xmath13 varying for each mosaic as in table  [ beamsize ] .",
    "channels were spaced every 0.824  and the velocity resolution was 1.32  .",
    "as noted in table  [ beamsize ] , a few syntheses were observed with a finer channel spacing of 0.41   ( or a central channel velocity of 0  ) leading to reduced spectral coverage ( toward negative velocities ) .",
    "understanding the noise properties of any telescope is necessary to inform an observing strategy .",
    "three maps related to the noise in a single synthesis are illustrated in figure  [ noisedf20 ] .",
    "the differences in each of these representations are discussed below .",
    "inspection of an emission - free channel map from this single dhiglssynthesis indicates that the typical rms noise for 0.824  channels is 18  mjy  beam@xmath58 ( or @xmath59  k ) .",
    "in fact , noise estimates for all syntheses compare well to the value measured for the original phase of the cgps carried out in the previous decade @xcite , @xmath60  k.    for astrophysical applications of a single synthesis , we need to correct each channel map by the primary beam of a 9  m antenna ( the effect of its attenuation ) , which amplifies the noise away from the center .",
    "we note that the primary beam is not a gaussian , but is well described by a @xmath61 function of radial offset @xcite with a fwhm of 108 .",
    "the corrected emission - free channel maps are therefore noticeably noisier around the periphery , as shown in the left panel of figure  [ noisedf20 ] .    the noise can also be quantified by finding the rms in the spectrum over many emission - free channels pixel by pixel ; after correction for the primary beam this gives us an empirical  noise map \" as in the middle panel . in making a mosaic , the contribution from a single synthesis",
    "is weighted according to the inverse square of the noise .",
    "the model for the weight map is therefore the square of the primary beam , here normalized to unity at the pointing center ( there is no dependence of the central value on @xmath53 as in the noise map ) .",
    "this map is shown in the right panel .",
    "each of the maps is truncated at a radius of 93 , where the noise has risen by a factor 9.5 compared to the value at the pointing center and the weight has fallen to 0.011 ( see figure  [ noisedf20 ] ) . as adopted for the cgps , data beyond this radius",
    "are not used in assembling the mosaics ( section  [ mosaicmake ] ) .",

    "are shown with dashed- and solid - line circles , respectively ( corresponding circles seen in single synthesis field df20 in figure  [ noisedf20 ] ) .",
    "dashed- and solid - line contours near edge of mosaic trace constant noise levels as discussed in section  [ mosaicnoise ] . ]    , but for the 76 pointings making up the mosaic of the en  region , with highlighted pointing en18 @xmath63 .",
    "note the difference in angular scale and the colorbar between these two figures . ]      in a single synthesis the rms noise level for a single channel varies across the field ( figure  [ noisedf20 ] ) .",
    "the noise level can be made more uniform and/or greatly reduced by assembling a number of single syntheses as a mosaic .",
    "for example , the cgps mosaic pattern was that of a close - packed hexagonal grid with pointing centres separated by @xmath64 , a bit larger than the fwhm , a compromise between uniform sensitivity and spatial coverage at 1420  mhz .",
    "with this in mind , for the much fainter en  region we chose a pattern of single pointings to emphasize sensitivity over spatial coverage with spacings of about @xmath65 , while for the brighter df  we opted for more extended coverage with spacings of about @xmath66 .",
    "figures  [ coveragedf ] and [ coverageen ] show the pointing centers for df  and en , numbering 91 and 76 respectively ( see table  [ beamsize ] ) .",
    "these figures are in icrs coordinates ( @xmath15 ) and the ncp projection @xcite native to the drao  st  data .",
    "the central position of each synthesis field is marked by a bullet . for scale , we show the fwhm of the primary as a dashed circle of diameter @xmath67 .",
    "also shown as the solid circle is the @xmath68 truncation radius ( @xmath69 diameter ) used in the production of the final mosaic .",
    "the pointing centers for the other mosaics of dhigls  regions are given in figure  [ field_locations ] and figure  [ coverageum ] .",
    "a synthesized beam for each of the fields was produced corresponding to the visibility coverage in the fourier domain .",
    "this beam was normalized to unity at its center . because much of the data processing involves approximating the beam with a gaussian",
    ", the synthesized beam was fitted in the image domain with a two - dimensional ( 2d ) gaussian to determine the effective beam size .",
    "the effective beam size was consistently smaller than the half - power beam - width ( hpbw ) of @xmath70 and consistently peaked at 1.08 with a relative beam integral of 1.08 ( see figure  [ beamfit1d ] ) .",
    "the mean gaussian fwhm of the synthesized beam and its dispersion for the mosaic is given in table  [ beamsize ] for each region .",
    "two continuum maps are produced from an average of the channels at each end of the spectrum that are free of  emission .",
    "the channel selection is performed independently for each synthesis with the median number of channels used for a continuum map being 30 , separately for each end .",
    "the continuum contribution at each channel in the spectral cube is then determined by linear interpolation between these two continuum maps .",
    "empirically there is only a minimal frequency dependence of the continuum over the frequency range of the data cube and so in the few exceptional cases where there are emission - free channels at only one end of the spectrum the resulting single continuum map is subtracted directly from the spectral cube .    in a number of fields",
    "there are very bright point sources that produce correspondingly bright artifacts in the form of grating rings .",
    "subtraction of the continuum will in principle remove the continuum source and any artifacts around it .",
    "however , within the spectral cube the continuum emission could be absorbed by diffuse  in some channels , resulting in a weaker point source and a concomitantly weaker set of artifacts in those channels .",
    "following subtraction of the unattenuated continuum , a scaled negative imprint of the source and artifacts would remain in those absorbing channels . for weaker point sources ,",
    "the artifacts are hidden in the noise but to mitigate such potential residual contamination for bright sources it is useful to create a clean cube prior to producing the continuum maps , by deconvolving those bright point sources with a model beam .",
    "this cleaning process follows routines developed for the drao  st  by @xcite and is performed on each channel in a given cube .",
    "it is performed only on those cubes having continuum point sources with flux density @xmath71  jybeam@xmath58  and this cleaning proceeds down to the level of 300  mjybeam@xmath58  as was done in the cgps @xcite .",
    "an averaged continuum map was produced for each synthesis from the two continuum maps .",
    "each point source in this map was fitted with a 2d gaussian ( with the fluxfit routine included in the drao export software package madr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to determine its sky coordinates ( @xmath15 ) and flux density @xmath72 , limiting the width of each fit to be no less than 95% of the effective beam parameters determined in section  [ beamdef ] .",
    "the fitted values were compared with those in the nvss database @xcite to determine for each field a weighted average offset in sky coordinates ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) and a weighted average flux density ratio , @xmath75 . @xcite discuss this in detail .",
    "we find values of the flux density ratio @xmath76 in the range 1.2 to 1.5 ; the typical uncertainty for each determination is 0.03 .    because the synthesized beam is not quite gaussian , @xmath72 measured by gaussian fitting will be overestimated by a factor of about 1.08 ( section  [ beamdef ] ) .",

    "we note that changes in the equivalent vla to nvss ratio cited as part of the vgps @xcite , though also not fully understood , were shown to be related to the band - averaged scalar amplitude of the continuum - subtracted visibilities , which is in turn connected to the noise .",

    "one is from the choice of overlap range .",
    "for example , the values of @xmath163 using data from the independent annuli between 13 m and 26.4 m and between 26.4 m and 35 m are @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively .",

    "we also correlated power spectrum moduli in 2d , finding @xmath109 from the square root of the slope .",
    "this is akin to fitting a common power law to the two sets of data . again",
    "the weighting changes and we found @xmath168 . we note that correlating power spectrum moduli in 1d ( a weighted fit is indicated ) is less satisfactory , because of the compression of the data in @xmath82 and azimuthal coverage before the correlation ( though it should make no difference for noise - free data ) .    from these investigations , we estimate that the systematic error in @xmath109 is 0.03",
    ".    we also looked at the cross calibration factor synthesis by synthesis .",
    "the drao  st  data have to be corrected for the effect of the primary beam , which limits the spatial coverage to about 90  and makes the data noisier at the low end of the @xmath82 range .",
    "an annulus between 25 and 50  m ( @xmath169 arcmin@xmath58 ) was selected .",
    "we found a mean cross calibration factor @xmath170 , consistent with the above . as another check",
    ", we used drao  st  data that were not scaled to nvss and found that the values of @xmath171 were well correlated with the inverse of @xmath76 ( section  [ register ] ) .",
    "this indicates that if cross calibration synthesis by synthesis were sufficiently precise , there would be no point in first doing the synthesis by synthesis scaling to nvss .",
    "we adopted a common cross calibration factor of @xmath172 for all seven dhigls regions .",
    "a correction of the same order was found by @xcite for combining gbt and vla data .",
    "this is mentioned not for direct comparison to our @xmath109 , but to point out that a non - unity cross calibration factor is not unprecedented .",
    "it is generally the case for the dhigls  spectra that the optical depth @xmath173 is small .",
    "this can be illustrated as follows .",
    "for optically thick  emission , the brightness temperature @xmath77 saturates at the spin temperature @xmath174 . for optically thin emission , on the other hand , @xmath175 .",
    "a plausible value of the cnm spin temperature is @xmath154  k , the collisional temperature found from intermediate - latitude h@xmath176 observations for values of @xmath4  near @xmath177  @xmath178@xcite .",
    "this is not too different from the distribution @xmath179  k found by @xcite for translucent lines of sight at lower latitude .",
    "a single @xmath174 along any line of sight is in any case only an approximation .",
    "for cnm gas in thermal equilibrium @xcite show ( in their figure  10 ) that the gas temperature ( and so @xmath174 ) is roughly inversely related to @xmath180 . for",
    "comparison to @xmath174 , even for the channel map in df  with the brightest emission ( at 3.45  ) the average @xmath181 is 12  k ; the dispersion is 9  k with a low exponential tail to about 40  k. the total emission is enhanced by contributions from the wnm gas as well , for which the absorption is much smaller . we conclude that optical depth effects on the emission spectrum are typically small .",
    "column density can be calculated with an approximate correction for optical depth assuming a single spin temperature @xmath174 using @xmath182 rather than simply @xmath183@xmath143 .",
    "we used @xmath154  k. corrections are small , consistent with the results of @xcite for the perseus molecular cloud region ; they found significant corrections only for column densities much greater than @xmath184  @xmath178 , larger than typically found in our intermediate latitude regions .",
    "the correction in equation  ( [ taucorrect ] ) clearly depends on the contrast of the observed brightness @xmath77 relative to @xmath174 .",
    "because peaks in the intrinsic  emission on the sky are diminished if the observing beam is larger than the spatial structure , the estimated optical depth correction is reduced at lower resolution .",
    "we estimated the impact on ghigls  @xmath4  maps by comparing results from data at two differing resolutions , assuming @xmath154  k. for the first map , @xmath4  was created from the dhigls  cube using equation  ( [ taucorrect ] ) and then convolved to the ghiglsresolution and regridded to 35 pixels .",
    "we call this @xmath4(dhigls ) . for the second map we convolved the dhigls  cube to the ghigls  resolution , regridded , and then computed @xmath4 .",
    "we call this @xmath4(ghigls ) . the resulting difference , expressed as @xmath185 @xmath4(dhigls)@xmath186 @xmath4(ghigls)@xmath187 , is positive .    within the high signal to noise region bounded by",
    "the white dashed contour in df , and for the lvc component , we found @xmath188 for @xmath189 in units of k  , meaning that at the lower resolution of actual ghigls  @xmath4/@xmath190 is underestimated by of order 0 to 2  k  for this region . from table  3 in @xcite , the uncertainty for the lvc component of ( ghigls  field ) spider , @xmath191  @xmath12 , or @xmath192  k  , comparable to the maximum additional @xmath189 correction .",
    "thus the uncertainty of @xmath4  cited in @xcite might be somewhat underestimated in this systematic way by not accounting for the resolution dependence of optical depth effects .",
    "further discussion of the effect of the optical depth correction and the dependence on @xmath174 can be found in the analysis of the ghiglsdata in @xcite .    whether there is a significant effect on the estimated optical depth correction for the dhigls data would depend on whether the bright spatial structures are still unresolved at the resolution of the drao  st .",
    "there is the further uncertainty in the correction because the value of @xmath174 is not known precisely and is unlikely to be constant .",
    "for the lvc gas in the dhigls  um  region we found a power law exponent @xmath193 for the @xmath4  map ( section  [ nhanalysis ] ) and @xmath194 for the centroid velocity map ( section  [ centroid ] ) .    in their analysis of lvc gas in early drao",
    "st  data of two adjacent intermediate - latitude pointings in ursa major ( ursa ; these correspond to the fp2 and nn pointings among our current 16 pointings for the um - i  mosaic ) , @xcite found an exponent @xmath9 for both the @xmath4  map and centroid velocity map .",
    "particular features in their data processing and analysis of the @xmath4map might have contributed to the difference with respect to our value .",
    "( i ) to mitigate against the effects of noise , the drao  st  data were filtered .",
    "filtering on small angular scales ( high @xmath82 ) might remove not only noise but also some  signal power at these @xmath82 values , artificially steepening the power spectrum .",
    "( ii ) no explicit allowance was made for the effect of the synthesized beam and this was stated to contribute to the reported uncertainty of the exponent .",
    "( iii ) their drao  st  data were combined with zero - spacing data from the 26  m single dish at drao , which does not allow for the same cross calibration as done here for the gbt data ( see appendix  [ crosscalib ] and figure  [ overlapfig ] ) . if the drao  st  data calibration were low relative to the 26  m data , the power spectrum of @xmath4  would be artificially steepened .",
    "it is additionally puzzling that the steeper power spectrum in this earlier work appeared to be corroborated by analysis of entirely independent leiden / dwingeloo  data in a large enclosing field in the ncpl  that extended the power spectrum to larger angular scales ( smaller @xmath82 ) ; see figures 14 and 15 in @xcite .",
    "that power spectrum produced from the leiden / dwingeloo data ranged from @xmath195arcmin@xmath58 to about 0.018arcmin@xmath58 .",
    "according to figure  [ overlapfig ] power should be reduced in this range , by the square of the 357 beam of the 25  m dwingeloo telescope , steepening the apparent power spectrum . however ,",
    "this was not accounted for in their analysis .",
    "we explored this further using a 7  by 10  region selected from the ghigls  ncpl  field and a related large 25  by 25field from lab data .",
    "we made @xmath4  maps selecting lvc in the velocity range observed by @xcite ( @xmath196  ) .",
    "accounting for the respective beams , we find power spectra of @xmath4  with @xmath197 and @xmath198 for ghigls  and lab , respectively , consistent with what we found for the dhigls  um  region .",
    "the results for the analysis of the corresponding centroid velocity maps are similar : @xmath199 and @xmath200 for ghigls  and lab , respectively .",
    "if the correction for the beam is ignored in the power spectrum model , it is clear that the fit will result in a steeper power law unless the upper limit of the fitted @xmath82-range is reduced appropriately .",
    "note also that for the combined lab survey , the effective beam of 40  and 05 beam sampling result in a further reduction in power at high @xmath82 ( see appendix a in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , exacerbating the steepening .",
    "concerns related to ( i ) and ( ii ) above would apply to the power spectrum analysis of the centroid velocity map and the velocity channel analysis in @xcite . for the latter , the s / n first increases as additional channels are added to the emission being integrated and the relative noise is reduced .",
    "not accounting for this decrease in the relative noise level ( for example by not including a model of the noise in the power spectrum model ) could result in an artificial steepening of the power law as the noise is reduced , depending on the range in @xmath82 over which the noise dominates .",
    "as summarized in table  [ beamsize ] , the dhigls  data also include three other mosaics with fewer pointings and two single pointing syntheses .",
    "these have been processed as described for the df - i  and en - i  mosaics .",
