    "one of the first experimental realizations of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) has been done with sodium atoms trapped in a novel trap that employed both magnetic and optical forces @xcite . in this trap ,",
    "the repulsive optical potential is created by tightly focusing an intense blue - detuned laser that generates a repulsive optical plug bunging a hole in a center of magnetic trap where nonadiabatic spin flips lead to a loss of atoms .",
    "further developments of bec traps , and remarkable progress of bec experimentstheory are reviewed in @xcite .    in spite of these achievements ,",
    "the fundamental question about interplay of dynamics , interactions and thermalization of bec in a concrete trap configuration still waits its clarification . in this work",
    "we address this question in the frame of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) version of the trap used in the experimental setup @xcite .",
    "thus the trap potential is represented by a 2d harmonic potential and a rigid disk which center is located in a vicinity of the center of harmonic potential . if the harmonic potential is replaced by rigid walls forming a square or rectangle then the classical dynamics in such a sinai billiard is proven to be completely chaotic @xcite .",
    "the recent analysis of the trap with the walls formed by a harmonic potential shows that the dynamics remains chaotic with a very small measure of integrable dynamics @xcite .",
    "this trap was called the sinai oscillator @xcite due to a similarity with a sinai billiard . since the realization of rigid walls is rather difficult for experimental realization the case of sinai oscillator trap",
    "becomes much more attractive for combined theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "in fact a sinai oscillator trap in three - dimensions ( 3d ) had been implemented in @xcite . here",
    "we restrict our investigations to the 2d case expecting that its main features will be preserved in 3d .",
    "the quantum properties of sinai oscillator are characterized within random matrix theory @xcite by the wigner - dyson statistics of energy levels @xcite .",
    "the properties of the eigenstates are typical for those of systems of quantum chaos and now are well understood ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    below",
    "we show that the sinai oscillator trap in 2d is also characterized by the properties of quantum chaos : the quantum eigenstates of sinai oscillator are ergodic and the level spacing statistic is described by the random matrix theory , in agreement with the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture @xcite .",
    "however , still there is no thermalization in this system since the eigenstates are preserved in absence of interactions .",
    "thus , in this work we analyze the dynamics and thermalization conditions for bec in the sinai oscillator in the frame of the gpe equation .",
    "the gpe description is valid in the regime where the bec temperature @xmath0 is below the critical temperature of bose - einstein condensation @xmath1 @xcite and when the validity of gpe description is well justified @xcite .    even though from the mathematical view point the question about existence of solutions of the gpe in such a trap , at moderate nonlinearity and large times , remains an open problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the gpe can be rewritten in the basis of linear eigenstates ( modes ) where the coupling between modes takes place only due to the nonlinearity in gpe . in this representation",
    "each mode can be considered as an independent oscillator degree of freedom and in case of thermalization , induced by nonlinearity , one should expect energy equipartition over all modes @xcite leading to ultra - violet catastrophe and energy transfer to high energy modes .",
    "in fact , the planck constant and the planck law had been introduced for a black - body radiation to avoid such a divergence @xcite . however , the planck distribution is valid for quantum systems while in our case of the gpe sinai oscillator there is no second quantization .",
    "thus due to classical nonlinear interactions between modes one would expect to have a classical ergodicity with equipartition of energy between modes .",
    "indeed , such an equipartition expectation was at the origin of the studies of the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) problem @xcite .",
    "nevertheless its absence is consequence of the proximity to the integrable toda lattice ( see e.g. @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "thus the fpu oscillator chain has certain specific features which break system ergodicity in energy .",
    "however , it is natural to expect that in a generic case , when eigenstates of a linear system are ergodic and dynamical chaos of classical trajectories takes place , the energy equipartition over modes should appear above certain border of nonlinear interaction strength between modes .    in spite of these expectations of energy equipartition over modes ,",
    "the recent studies of the gpe in bunimovich stadium showed that the nonlinearity produces an effective dynamical thermalization in a completely isolated system , without any contact with external thermal bath , with the probabilities over linear modes described by the bose - einstein ( be ) distribution @xcite .",
    "thus the probabilities on high energy modes drop rapidly and the ultra - violet catastrophe is absent .",
    "an experimental realization of the bunimovich billiard with cold atoms is possible but is not so simple .",
    "due to this reason we consider here the gpe sinai oscillator trap which in fact has been already built in @xcite but without investigation of phenomenon of dynamical thermalization .",

    "since the classical dynamics is chaotic and the measure of integrable islands is very small it is natural to expect that at zero nonlinearity @xmath40 the sinai oscillator belongs to systems of quantum chaos @xcite . indeed , using the advanced methods of quantum chaos on numerical computation of eigenenergies and eigenstates in chaotic billiards ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we find numerically several thousands of eigenenergies @xmath41 and eigenstates @xmath42 ( linear modes ) at @xmath40 .",

    "was used for the analysis of effects of nonlinearity on the anderson localization in disordered lattices @xcite known also as the danse model @xcite . in this model it was found that a moderate nonlinearity leads to a destruction of the anderson localization of linear eigenmodes and a subdiffusive spreading of wave packet over lattice sites with time .",
    "such a spreading has been studied by different groups ( see e.g. @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "even if the representations for the gpe sinai oscillator ( [ eq4 ] ) and danse models are similar there are significant differences : ( a ) in danse the eigenenergies are bounded in a finite energy band while here @xmath49 are growing with @xmath29 ( we note that for the bunimovich billiard we have @xmath50 @xcite ) ; ( b ) in danse the transitions @xmath51 give coupling mainly between states inside the same localization length while here there are transitions even between very different @xmath29 values . at the same time we should say that the properties of matrix elements @xmath51 are still waiting their detailed analysis for the cases of sinai oscillator and bunimovich billiard",
    ".    we also note that the question of energy transfer to high energy modes has certain links with the kolmogorov turbulence which is based on the concept of energy flow from large to small scales via the inertial interval ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the energy is injected at large scale and absorbed on small scales and a presence of some small noise is assumed to induce thermalization .",
    "in such an approach the `` quantum '' turbulence in gpe ( or nonlinear schdinger equation ( nls ) ) has been studied in a rectangular 2d billiard @xcite and in 3d cube @xcite . due to the billiard shape chosen there ,",
    "the ray dynamics is integrable and it is not obvious if the dynamical thermalization takes place in such a billiard in absence of noise . below we will see that at moderate nonlinearity and absence of noise there is no dynamical thermalization in oscillator trap and billiards of rectangular shape ( see the later case in @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in purely dynamical systems ( without external noise ) it is possible that the kolmogorov flow to high modes can be stopped by kam integrability and anderson localization @xcite .",
    "our results show that the quantum chaos for linear eigenmodes facilitates onset of dynamic thermalization , appearing in an isolated system without any noise , when the strength of nonlinear term is above a certain dynamical thermalization border @xmath52 .",
