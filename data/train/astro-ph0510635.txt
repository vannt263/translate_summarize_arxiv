    "water is a key ingredient in many astrophysical environments , including circumstellar disks .",
    "it is the main constituent of the icy mantles coating interstellar grains , and can be one of the most abundant molecules in the gas phase . for these reasons",
    ", water may dominate both the chemistry ( being a major oxygen reservoir ) and the thermal balance ( i.e. cooling ) of the gas component of protostellar disks .",
    "in addition , water vapor and water ice in protoplanetary disks are the major reservoirs of water later to be found in planets , asteroids and comets and , therefore , are of great relevance for understanding the origin of the solar system and the distribution of volatiles within it .",
    "unfortunately , the observation of water molecules in interstellar space is nearly impossible from the ground because of the absorption by the terrestrial atmosphere .",
    "so far , just a handful of space - based instruments ( iso , swas and odin ) have carried out observations of water vapor lines in interstellar molecular clouds , but these instruments did not have the sensitivity to observe water protoplanetary disks . however , the up - coming esa / nasa mission herschel will provide a sensitive instrument , hifi , for these studies",
    "@xcite . also , sofia has potential for water observations .",
    "meanwhile , hdo , as the most important isotope of water , is currently the best ground - based probe of the presence of water in astrophysical environments .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the first discovery of hdo ( and therefore also the first discovery of water ) in a protoplanetary disk , namely dm tau .",
    "the observations show an absorption line of gas phase hdo with a line - to - continuum ratio of 0.9 which translates into an average column density through the disk of @xmath7 @xmath5 . in the region where hdo is located ,",
    "its fractional abundance is estimated to be about @xmath8 .",
    "if the abundance of gaseous h@xmath3o is similar to the value observed in molecular clouds and protostars , @xmath9 , hdo / h@xmath3o ratio is 0.01 .",
    "the fact that the line is a deep absorption line immediately indicates that hdo must be present above the midplane ( from where the sub - millimeter continuum is emitted ) .",
    "it must also be present especially in the outer radial regions ( @xmath10 au ) of the disk since the continuum originates from an extended region .",
    "the presence of a large column of hdo in this location was a surprise , since the grain temperatures in this region are below 25 k , and h@xmath3o and hdo should be almost entirely frozen out onto grains .",
    "chemical models including _ thermal _ desorption of water ice and gas - phase formation of h@xmath3o predict a h@xmath3o column of 10@xmath11 @xmath5 at about 400au , only a factor of 5 larger than the observed hdo column .",
    "@xcite included photo - desorption by a strong stellar uv field and found h@xmath3o column densities of about @xmath12@xmath5 at 700au .",
    "an extended component of hdo ( and consequently water ) therefore indicates a desorption agent from grain surfaces .",
    "important possibilities are x - rays originating from the star , and penetrating throughout the entire outer disk , and uv photons , either from the star or simply due to the interstellar radiation field .",
    "high energy photons can in principle act to remove h@xmath3o molecules from the ice layers on dust grains .",
    "x - rays are energetic enough to remove a number of molecules , if sufficient energy can be concentrated close to the surface of the ice mantle on a grain .",
    "this idea has been explored by @xcite who considered x - ray heating of small grains , or spot heating of larger grains .",
    "small grains , or small thermally insulated spots on large grain can be heated strongly enough by a single x - ray absorbed photon to lead to thermal evaporation of part of the ice mantle .",
    "an alternative mechanism is desorption by fuv photons @xcite .",
    "an fuv photon absorbed in the surface layer of an ice mantle can lead to the release of a molecule into the gas . in this letter",
    "we explore the effect of just the interstellar fuv radiation field irradiating the disk surface of dm tau .",
    "we show that such a scenario leads to a layer of water vapor in the disk surface to an fuv optical depth around unity . the column densities reached in steady state appear to be a viable explanation for the hdo absorption line seen in dm tau . to show this we developed a simple model of the chemistry leading to the presence of water vapor in irradiated gas containing grains covered by layers of water ice .",
    "a much more detailed discussion in the context of a full photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) model , as well as analytical formulas to estimate h@xmath3o column densities under such conditions will be given by hollenbach et al ( 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "here we report the application of this model to the case of dm tau .",
    "a forthcoming paper will present the results of a larger parameter space study , which will explore the dependence of the model predictions especially on the characteristics of the grains ( ceccarelli et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the model computes the h@xmath3o abundance across a protoplanetary disk , as a function of the radius and height . for the physical structure we used the dust density and temperature profile which fits the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of dm tau @xcite , and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] .",
    "the gas is assumed to be fully coupled with the dust in terms of density distribution and temperature .    due to the low temperature , the dust grains are covered with an ice layer . in our model ,",
    "uv photons entering the disk surface are absorbed by dust grains , and cause photo - desorption of water molecules from the ice .",
    "only uv photons absorbed directly at the surface of the ice mantle can desorb a molecule , so that only a small fraction of absorbed photons will cause the ejection of h@xmath3o .",
    "laboratory experiments at lyman @xmath13 wavelength have shown that the involved yields are typically between 10@xmath14 and 10@xmath15 molecules per photon",
    ". the yield increases to some extent depending on the uv dose in the experiment , apparently because radical formation on the ice surface aids the desorption process @xcite .",
    "it is unclear how important this effect is in astrophysical environments , and we adopt a conservative value for the yield of 10@xmath14 molecules per incident fuv ( 6@xmath1613.6 ev ) photon .",
    "the yield probably introduce a factor of a few uncertainty into the computations ( see below ) .",
    "the desorption process at a given location will also depend on the attenuated fuv flux , and the rate per unit volume can be written as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fuv field in @xcite units .",
    "photons/@xmath20/s is the fuv flux for the standard habing interstellar field ( @xmath18=1 ) .",
    "@xmath21 is the photo - desorption yield .",
    "@xmath22 is h@xmath3 column density that gives @xmath23 between 6 and 13.6 ev ; we adopted a value equal to @xmath24 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 is the grain geometrical cross section , equal to @xmath26 , where we assumed an average grain size of 0.1 @xmath27 m .",
    "@xmath28 is the grain number density .",
    "the product @xmath29 is approximatively @xmath30 @xmath5 times the gas density @xmath31 , obtained assuming a gas to dust ratio in mass equal to 1:100 . after being released into the gas phase , water either freezes out back onto a grain , or it is photo - dissociated by the fuv photons at the rates : @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the sticking coefficient , for which we use 1 @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 is h@xmath3o molecule thermal velocity .",
    "@xmath36s@xmath37 is the rate of fuv dissociation in unshielded @xmath38 field .",
    "gaseous atomic oxygen can freeze out onto grains , where it is assumed to form water ice by reactions with hydrogen atoms on the grain surfaces .",
    "o atoms may also form water in the gas phase via the standard sequence of reactions started by the reaction between o and h@xmath39 .",
    "the gas phase formation of water thus proceeds at a rate : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is equal to @xmath42 s@xmath37 cm@xmath14 ( the rate coefficient for the reaction o + h@xmath39 @xmath44 oh@xmath45 + h@xmath3 ) times 0.33 ( the last factor accounts for the fraction of h@xmath46o@xmath45 recombinations with electrons forming h@xmath3o ) .",
    "the atomic oxygen abundance is also computed by the steady state equilibrium between formation and destruction processes : photo - dissociation of gas phase water ( eq .  ( [ eq:3 ] ) ) for the formation , and formation of gaseous water via reaction with h@xmath39 ( eq .  ( [ eq:4 ] ) ) and",
    "freezing onto the grains for the destruction of o. we assume that these reactions are the dominating processes , and that all the oxygen not contained in co or silicates is contained in o , h@xmath3o , and h@xmath3o ice .    finally , the h@xmath39 abundance is computed as follows .",
    "h@xmath39 is formed by cosmic ray ionization of h@xmath3 to form h@xmath47 , followed by the reaction with h@xmath3 to form h@xmath39 . in the regions where",
    "co molecules are not frozen onto the grain mantles , h@xmath39 is destroyed by the reaction with co. elsewhere , the h@xmath39 abundance is computed following the model described in @xcite , which takes into account all three deuterated forms of h@xmath39 and solves the chemical composition by considering the reactions between h@xmath45 , e@xmath48 , grains , and h@xmath39 isotopologues .",
    "figure [ fig : abundance ] shows the h@xmath3o abundance ( with respect to h@xmath3 ) across the disk , for a standard interstellar uv field ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : pdr ] shows a vertical cross - section of the chemical species involved in water formation at a radius of 700 au . despite the relatively large densities in the disk , water vapor has an abundance of @xmath2 in a large fraction of the outer disk , in the layers just above the midplane , where the a@xmath49 to the disk surface is lower than @xmath50 mag . by midplane here we mean the region where more than 2/3 of co molecules are frozen onto the grain mantles .",
    "this occurs at an height of about 230 au at a radius of 700 au , and 100 au at a radius of 400 au . above this height",
    ", co is desorbed thermallyo abundance in our model . ] .",
    "the gas phase water abundance peaks near the surface where the fuv desorbing flux is high and where the h@xmath39 abundance is high . in practice , the freeze - out rate of the h@xmath3o molecules is larger than the fuv photo - desorption rate of the grain mantles only at densities larger than about @xmath51 cm@xmath14 . at lower densities , assuming water is in the grain surfaces , water vapor is formed mostly through direct photo - desorption from mantles , and , to a lesser extent , by gas phase reactions occurring among atomic oxygen ( a product of h@xmath3o photo - dissociation ) and h@xmath39 . in the upper layers ,",
    "atomic oxygen is predicted to be very abundant .",
    "the resulting average gas phase h@xmath3o column density of a face - on disk is @xmath52 @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ fig : coldens ] shows how the column density is distributed as function of the radius .",
    "the column density is remarkably constant over most of the disk , although the column does rise slightly with radius .",
    "the first conclusion of our study is that _ vapor water can indeed be found with relatively high abundances ( @xmath53 ) and column densities ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) in the protoplanetary disks which surround low luminosity protostars illuminated by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , like in the case of dm tau_. this is caused by the photo - desorption of the icy grain mantles by the average isrf .",
    "increasing the fuv field by a factor of ten and hundred leads to h@xmath3o column densities larger by only factor 1.5 and 2 respectively . decreasing the fuv field by a factor ten results in decreasing the h@xmath3o column density by a factor a bit more than a factor 2 .",
    "therefore , the h@xmath3o column density is not sensitive to the addition of a possible fuv field from the central source or a nearby hot star ( see hollenbach et al .",
    "2005 for details and an analytical proof of the insensitivity to g@xmath54 ) .",
    "the fundamental reason for this insensitivity is that in higher fields , the increased photo - desorption of the ice is balanced by the increased photo - dissociation of gas phase h@xmath3o .",
    "as discussed above , the value of the photo - desorption yield , @xmath21 , is only constrained within a factor roughly three to ten by laboratory experiments .",
    "this uncertainty causes an uncertainty in the predicted h@xmath3o column density by the same factor .",
    "another important , and poorly known parameter that enters in these computations is the dust - to - gas ratio . in the standard case we assumed the canonical mass dust - to - gas ratio equal to 1% . if this value is increased by a factor ten ( which means decreasing by a factor 10 the gas density in the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] ) , the h@xmath3o column density increases by a factor @xmath55 . on the contrary ,",
    "a decrease by a factor ten of the dust - to - gas ratio leads to a decrease by a factor 1.2 of the h@xmath3o column density .",
    "this is due to the fact that the uv optical depth is determined by the dust distribution only and independent of the gas density .",
    "as long as photo - desorption , photo - dissociation and freeze - out are the dominant processes , the derived densities and column densities ( as opposed to the abundances ) of h@xmath3o are independent of the gas density .",
    "the small changes are due to regions in which the gas formation rout of h@xmath3o is important .",
    "therefore , also a drastic change in the dust - to - gas ratio does not cause much of a change in the h@xmath3o vapor column density .",
    "finally , the results will also depend on the grain size distribution .",
    "if much smaller grains than 0.1@xmath27 dominate the grain surface area , the balance between the different formation and destruction rates will be shifted .",
    "this question will be discussed in a followup paper .    in conclusion , we predict a h@xmath3o column density in protostellar disks similar to that surrounding dm tau of a few times @xmath56 @xmath5 , rather insensitive on the external fuv field and/or the dust - to - gas ratio in the disk .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of hdo in dm tau , with an observed column density of @xmath57 @xmath5 .",
    "based on the present theoretical model , the h@xmath3o column density is predicted to be @xmath58 @xmath5 , within about a factor of a few , given the uncertainties in the yield , fuv field and the dust - to - gas ratio . this implies a hdo / h@xmath3o ratio equal to about 1% .",
    "this is consistent with estimates of the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in embedded low mass protostars .",
    "measured a hdo / h@xmath3o ratio equal to 3% in the sublimated ices surrounding iras16293 - 2422 , and a much lower ( @xmath590.2% ) value in the outer envelope where the gas phase chemistry dominates the hdo and h@xmath3o formation .",
    "note that the large hdo / h@xmath3o ratio of 3% refers only to the sublimated ices , which are responsible for the water abundance @xmath60 in this object .",
    "very likely , the sublimated ices are only the `` last coating '' of the mantles where the molecular deuteration is the largest , due to the history of ice formation . in agreement with this interpretation",
    ", nir observations of hdo ice have , so far , failed to detect it , at a level of hdo / h@xmath3o@xmath61% @xcite therefore , only a small fraction of elemental deuterium is iced on the mantles .",
    "the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in dm tau , equal to @xmath6% , is just slightly lower than the value measured in iras16293 - 2422 and attributed to sublimated ices .",
    "if the values were indeed different , this might point to reprocessing of the ices in the disk - however , for this an actual measurement of the vapor water in dm tau is required .",
    "the measurement of the h@xmath3o column density would also allow to measure the photo - desorption yield .",
    "in addition , measures of the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in protoplanetary disks will probe the history of the ice formation , with important implications for the chemical and isotopic composition of solar system objects . based on our model",
    ", we predict the ground state transition of h@xmath3o at 557 ghz to be in absorption similar to the hdo ground transition at 464 ghz .",
    "the line is predicted to be highly optically thick , with @xmath62 .",
    "unfortunately , neither the currently available odin nor the planned hso satellites will be able to detect the continuum of dm tau , because of the large beam dilution of the signal from the disk .",
    "the results reported in this _ letter _",
    "lead to the following important conclusions : + 1 .",
    "an external uv radiation field as weak as the average habing field ( g@xmath63=1 ) can produce a layer of h@xmath3o on top of a protoplanetary disk ( like that surrounding dm tau ) with a column of a few times 10@xmath64@xmath5 .",
    "this column density is insensitive to external parameters like the strength of the radiation field : variations in g@xmath63 by two orders of magnitude only change n(h@xmath3o ) by a factor of 2 .",
    "+ 3 . similarly , changing the dust - to - gas ratio ( i.e. the gas density at a given dust density ) has only weak influence on the derived column densities .",
    "because of the weak dependence on parameters , the measurement of the h@xmath3o column density in protoplanetary disks is an excellent tool to measure the photo - desorption yield @xmath21 .",
    "+ 5 . combined with previous observations of hdo @xcite , we predict an hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in the outer disk of dm tau of 0.01 , with an uncertainty of about a factor of a few .",
    "we predict that the h@xmath3o ground state line at 557 ghz is undetectable in dm tau with odin and/or hso - hifi observations .",
    "+ finally , we remark that other molecules trapped in the water ices could also be released into the gas phase , keeping `` alive '' the gas chemistry in the layers above the midplane of the outer disk .",
