    "the formation of solar - like systems and binary stars may not simply follow the quasi - stationary paradigm of classical analytical calculations ( shu 1997 ; young & evans 2005 ) . instead , protoplanetary disks around these objects might experience an extremely chaotic evolutionary process , whereby vigorous protostellar mass - accumulation and disk stabilization are via inward migration and ejection of large spiral arcs and massive fragments .",
    "in fact , the observed luminosity of protostars is far less than the expected luminosity inferred from their averaged accretion rate ( evans et al .",
    "the most promising solution to this apparent paradox is episodic accretion ( kenyon et al .",

    "<S> young stellar objects ( ysos ) may not accumulate their mass steadily , as was previously thought , but in a series of violent events manifesting themselves as sharp stellar brightening . </S>",
    "<S> these events can be caused by fragmentation due to gravitational instabilities in massive gaseous disks surrounding young stars , followed by migration of dense gaseous clumps onto the star . </S>",
    "<S> we report our high angular resolution , coronagraphic near - infrared polarization imaging observations using the high contrast instrument for the subaru next generation adaptive optics ( hiciao ) of the subaru 8.2 m telescope , towards four ysos which are undergoing luminous accretion outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained infrared images have verified the presence of several hundred aus scale arms and arcs surrounding these ysos . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our hydrodynamics simulations and radiative transfer models further demonstrate that these observed structures can indeed be explained by strong gravitational instabilities occurring at the beginning of the disk formation phase . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of those tempestuous episodes of disk evolution on star and planet formation remains to be understood .    </S>"
