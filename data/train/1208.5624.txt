    "power law distributions occur in widely diverse physical systems spanning an impressive range of length scales @xcite .",
    "the appearance of heavy - tailed distributions is often traced to the presence of hierarchical structures in the system @xcite , whose complex `` interaction '' may result in violation of the statistical independence of subsystems , thus leading to non - gibbsian distributions @xcite . despite these insights and the many contributions to the problem @xcite ,",
    "it is fair to say that the physical mechanisms behind the emergence of power - law distributions are not yet well understood .",
    "recently , we introduced @xcite a general formalism to describe statistical equilibrium of complex systems with multiple scales where the probability distribution of states displays power - law tails . in this formalism , the hierarchical structure embedding the system of interest is effectively modeled as a set of nested `` internal heat reservoirs , '' where each  reservoir \" is described by only one effective degree of freedom , namely , its  temperature . \" on the basis of a few physically reasonable assumptions , it was possible to show that for a large class of systems the equilibrium distribution can be written explicitly in terms of certain generalized hypergeometric functions , which exhibit power law tails .",
    "this family of generalized hypergeometric ( ghg ) distributions includes , as its first two members , the boltzmann - gibbs distribution and the tsallis distribution @xcite .",
    "higher - order members of the ghg family of distributions have been shown to describe remarkably well the statistics of velocity fluctuations in turbulence @xcite .",
    "the ghg distribution represents a generalization of the canonical distribution for multiscale systems and hence it is also called multicanonical .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to give an alternative derivation , based on bayesian analysis , of the multicanonical distribution .",
    "because the derivation of the multicanonical distribution given here tries to parallel ( whenever possible ) the usual treatment of the canonical distribution , we shall begin our presentation by briefly reviewing the derivation of the canonical distribution .     a canonical system in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "arrows indicate energy exchange between the subsystems.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "consider a system in thermal equilibrium at some temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we recall that in the canonical formalism the constant temperature constraint is enforced by embedding the system is a much larger system ( i.e. , a heat bath ) capable of giving it energy @xcite .",
    "we designate the system of interest by the label 2 and the larger system embedding it by the label 1 , with the combined system formed by subsystems 1 and 2 being given the label 0 ; see fig .  1 .",
    "the energies of systems 1 and 2 will be denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the labels designating the possible states in each system .",
    "let us denote by @xmath5 the probability of finding system 0 in a state corresponding to energy @xmath6 .",
    "in view of the independence between systems 1 and 2 , one can then write @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the probabilities of finding systems 1 and 2 in states with energy @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . taking the logarithm derivative of ( [ eq : p0 ] ) with respect to @xmath10 yields @xmath12 where @xmath13 may be a function of @xmath10 but _ not _ of @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath14 comparing ( [ eq : beta1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dpo ] ) , one then concludes that @xmath15 since @xmath13 does not depend on @xmath11 , the preceding equation can be readily integrated , yielding @xmath16 since the partition of system 0 into subsystems 1 and 2 is entirely arbitrary , the quantity @xmath13 must be the same for any partition one chooses . in other words , @xmath13 is a characteristic of system 0 only , that is , @xmath17 which implies that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant",
    ".    it should be evident that the discussion above is completely symmetrical with respect to labels 1 and 2 , so that system 2 ( irrespective of its size ) obeys the same distribution law as system 1 . in then follows from ( [ eq : p0 ] ) and ( [ eq : p1 ] ) that the probability of finding any subsystem of system 0 in a state with energy @xmath20 is given by the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) distribution : @xmath21 where @xmath22is the density of states and @xmath23 is the partition function    it is important to emphasize here that the key step in deriving ( [ eq : bg ] ) was the ability to partition the system into two independent subsystems of arbitrary sizes , so that each subsystem is described by the same distribution law .",
    "there are however many physical systems , where the relevant probability distributions depend on the scale at which the measurements are made . in such complex systems",
    ", the system can not be partitioned into independent subsystems of arbitrary sizes , and one has to treat each dynamical scale separately , as discussed next .",
    "here we consider a multiscale system of size @xmath24 in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the system possesses a hierarchy of dynamical structures of characteristic sizes @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a number greater than 1 .",
    "( the specific value of @xmath27 is not relevant here . )",
    "we suppose furthermore that there is a wide separation of time scales within this hierarchy , with smaller structures having shorter characteristic times .",
    "let us now consider a partition of our system into `` nested '' subsystems of sizes @xmath28 , as indicated in fig .  2 .",
    "we shall designate the subsystem of size @xmath28 by the label @xmath29 .",
    "the `` thermodynamic state '' of each subsystem @xmath29 will be characterized by only one parameter , namely , its inverse temperature @xmath30 .",
    "as before , we designate the combined system consisting of all subsystems by the label 0 .     a multicanonical system in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 .",
    ", scaledwidth=30.0% ]    let us now focus our attention on the subsystem @xmath31 of size @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath32 is the smallest characteristic length scale in the system , it is clear that this subsystem can be arbitrarily divided into two independent subsystems .",
    "thus , repeating the same reasoning that led to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bg ] ) , one obtains that the energy distribution law for this subsystem is given by @xmath33 note , however , that owing to the ( intermittent ) energy exchange between subsystem @xmath31 and its immediate surrounding , represented by subsystem @xmath34 , the parameter @xmath35 is no longer constant but rather will fluctuate randomly . if we denote by @xmath36 the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath35 , then the marginal distribution @xmath37 for subsystem @xmath31 reads @xmath38    next we wish to compute @xmath36 . to do so , we shall make use of bayesian analysis @xcite",
    ". first recall that subsystem @xmath31 is embedded in a much larger subsystem @xmath39 , characterized by the parameter @xmath40 , which is assumed to vary much slower than @xmath35 .",
    "we are thus interested in computing @xmath41 . from bayes theorem @xcite",
    "one has @xmath42 where @xmath40 is considered a ( hyper)parameter of the distribution of @xmath35 . in bayesian parlance , the distribution @xmath43 is called the prior distribution , @xmath44 is the likelihood function , and @xmath45 is the posterior distribution . [ in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) we introduced the notation @xmath46 for convenience . ]",
    "let us assume , as is often done in bayesian analysis , that the prior distribution is conjugate to the likelihood @xmath44 , meaning that the posterior distribution follows the same parametric form as the prior distribution . if we consider the rather general case where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 , it then follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bg ] ) that @xmath44 is given by @xmath50 which when viewed as the likelihood of the parameter @xmath35 is proportional to a gamma distribution .",
    "now , it is well known @xcite that in this case the conjugate prior is also a gamma distribution , and so we have@xmath51 where @xmath52 is a constant . in obtaining eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) we also used the fact that @xmath53 , as it should , since subsystem @xmath34 acts as a heat reservoir for subsystem @xmath31 . by scale",
    "invariance , we assume that the distribution @xmath54 , for @xmath55 , has the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "we now have @xmath56 using this relation recursively then yields @xmath57 with @xmath54 given by eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) . after inserting eq .",
    "( [ marginal ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ pe ] ) , and performing a sequence of changes of variables of the type @xmath58 , one can show that the resulting multidimensional integral can be expressed in terms of known higher transcendental functions : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the generalized hypergeometric function of order @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the small - scale partition function , @xmath62 , is given by @xmath63^n .",
    "\\label{eq : a11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one important property of the generalized hypergeometric ( ghg ) distribution given in ( [ eq : ghg ] ) is that it exhibits power - law tails of the form : @xmath64 , for @xmath65 .",
    "this follows immediately from the asymptotic expansion of the function @xmath66 @xcite : @xmath67 , as @xmath68 .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the first two members of the family @xmath69 yield elementary functions , namely , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the @xmath73-exponential : @xmath74^{1/(1-q)}$ ] .",
    "the ghg distribution with @xmath75 thus recovers the boltzmann - gibbs distribution , whereas for @xmath76 it gives the @xmath73-exponential or tsallis distribution @xcite .",
    "one then sees from the preceding discussion that if a system with only one time scale is in thermal equilibrium then the boltzmann - gibbs distribution follows , whereas if it has two distinct time scales the tsallis distribution should be applicable . for complex systems with more than two characteristic time scales , such as turbulent flows , ghg distributions of higher order are thus required @xcite .",
    "we have presented an alternative derivation , based on bayesian analysis , of the multicanonical distribution , which describes the statistical equilibrium of complex systems possessing a hierarchy of time and length scales .",
    "we have shown that the multicanonical distribution can be written explicitly in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions , which exhibit a power - law asymptotic behavior .",
    "this thus shows that the emergence of power law distributions  an ubiquitous feature in nature  is intimately connected with the existence of multiple time and length scales in the system ."
