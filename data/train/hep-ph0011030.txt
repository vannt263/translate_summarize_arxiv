    "among the different techniques which have been proposed to search for dark matter particles @xcite , detection of a neutrino flux by means of neutrino telescopes represents certainly an interesting tool .",
    "although direct detection @xcite at present appears to be somewhat more sensitive to neutralino dark matter @xcite , nevertheless all the different possibilities are worth being explored . in this paper",
    "we discuss the flux of upgoing muons which are a consequence of @xmath1 s produced inside the earth , with special emphasis on the role which is played in this kind of searches by the possible presence of neutrino oscillation .",
    "neutralinos can be gravitationally captured inside astrophysical bodies @xcite , like the earth and the sun .",
    "their subsequent annihilation can produce a flux of neutrinos , which then travel toward a detector located underground below the earth surface .",
    "the differential flux , for each neutrino flavour @xmath3 , is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the neutralino annihilation rate , @xmath6 is the distance between the detector and the source ( which can be the center of the earth or the sun ) , @xmath7 is an index which lists all the possibile final states which can be produced by neutralino pair - annihilation , @xmath8 denotes , for each final state @xmath7 , the branching ratios into heavy quarks , @xmath9 leptons and gluons .",
    "the differential spectra of neutrinos and antineutrinos generated by the @xmath9 and by hadronization of quarks and gluons and the subsequent semileptonic decays of the produced hadrons are denoted by @xmath10 . for more details , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we only recall that the annihilation rate depends , through its relation with the capture rate of neutralinos in the earth , on some astrophysical parameters , the most relevant of which is the local density @xmath11 .    the best way of identifying the presence of these fluxes relies on the possibility to detect upward going muons inside a neutrino telescope .",
    "these upgoing muons would be produced by the @xmath1 component of the neutrino fluxes of eq.(1 ) .",
    "the charged - current interaction of the @xmath1 s with the rock below and close to the detector would produce a flux of muons .",
    "a double - differential muon flux is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the avogadro s number , @xmath15 is the survival probability that a muon of initial energy @xmath16 will have a final energy @xmath17 after propagating along a distance @xmath18 inside the rock and @xmath19 is the charged - current cross section for the production of a muon of energy @xmath20 from a neutrino ( antineutrino ) of energy @xmath21 .",
    "a useful quantity for our discussion is the muon response function @xmath22 where @xmath23 is threshold energy for detection of up  going muons . for super",
    "kamiokande and macro , @xmath24 gev @xcite .",
    "the muon response function identifies the neutrino energy range that is mostly responsile for the up  going muon signal .",
    "1 shows a few examples of it , plotted as functions of the variable @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the neutralino mass .",
    "1 shows an approximate scaling of @xmath27 with @xmath26 .",
    "the maximum of the muon response occurs for neutrino energies of about @xmath28 , with a half width which extends from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "the quantity which is actually measured is the total flux of up  going muons , which is defined as @xmath31 @xmath32 can be calculated once a specific supersymmetric model is adopted . in the case of a model where",
    "all the supersymmetric parameters are defined and set at the electroweak scale ( which we call here mssm ) , the result for @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "we have varied the mssm parameters in the ranges : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "up - to - date bounds and limits coming from accelerators and from br(@xmath38 have been imposed . for a definition of supersymmetric models and their parameters , as well as the implementation of the experimental limits on susy searches ,",
    "for calculations of @xmath32 in supergravity inspired ( sugra ) models , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "2 also shows the present most stringent upper limit obtained by the macro collaboration @xcite .",
    "super kamiokande recently also reported a similar upper bound @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino deficit strongly points toward the indication that the @xmath1 may oscillate . the oscillation channel which best describes the anomaly is @xmath0 vacuum oscillation @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , also the @xmath1 produced by neutralino annihilations would undergo an oscillation process .",
    "the range of energies involved in both atmospheric and neutralino  produced neutrinos is approximately the same , while the baseline of oscillation of the two neutrino components is different atmospheric neutrinos which induce upgoing muons cover a range of pathlengths which ranges from twice the earth s radius , for vertical muons , to much shorter distances in the case of horizonthal muons . on the contrary ,",
    "neutrinos produced by neutralino annihilation in the central part of the earth travel a distance of the order of the earth s radius to reach the detector .",
    "on the basis of the features of the @xmath1 oscillation which are required to fit the experimental data on atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , we expect that also the neutrino flux from dark matter annihilation would be affected @xcite .    for @xmath0 oscillation ,",
    "the @xmath1 flux is reduced because of oscillation , but we have to take into account that neutralino annihilation can also produce @xmath39 which in turn can oscillate into @xmath1 and contribute to the up  going muon flux .",
    "the muon neutrino flux can therefore be expressed as ( we are considering only two - flavour oscillation ) @xmath40 \\ , , \\ ] ] where the vacuum survival probability is @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mass square difference of the two neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath43 is the mixing angle in vacuum and @xmath44 is the earth s radius .",
    "3 shows the survival probability for two different values of the neutrino oscillation parameters which are inside their allowed ranges @xcite .",
    "smaller ( larger ) values of @xmath42 have the effect of shifting the curves to the left ( right ) . comparing fig . 1 with fig .",
    "3 , we notice that the reduction of the up  going muon flux is stronger when there is matching between the the energy @xmath45 of the first ( from the right ) minimum of the survival probability and the energy @xmath46 which is responsible for most of the muon response in the detector .",
    "this implies that a maximum reduction of the signal could occur for neutralino masses of the order of @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 oscillation makes the reduction of the muon flux less severe , but it is not able to completely balance the reduction effect because the original @xmath39 flux at the source is smaller than the @xmath1 flux .",
    "therefore , the overall effect of the neutrino oscillation is to reduce the up  going muon signal . the upgoing muon flux for a neutralino in the mssm , when neutrino oscillation is included , is given in fig .",
    "4 . this , when compared with fig .",
    "2 , shows the effect induced by the presence of oscillation .",
    "the ratio of the up  going muon signals in the presence and in the absence of oscillation is plotted in fig .",
    "we notice that the strongest effect occurs for light neutralinos , since in this case the muon flux is mostly produced from neutrinos whose energy is in the range of maximal suppression for the oscillation phenomenon .",
    "the effect is between 0.5 and 0.8 for @xmath49 gev . on the contrary ,",
    "the fluxes for larger masses are less affected , and the reduction is less than about 20% for @xmath50 gev . figs . 2 , 4 and 5 update the corresponding figures of ref.@xcite by the inclusion of the new limits from accelerator on higgs and supersymmetry searches .",
    "in this paper we have discussed to which extent neutrino oscillation can affect the up  going muon signal from neutralino annihilation in the earth . while the experimental upper limit is , at present , practically not affected by neutrino oscillation @xcite",
    ", the theoretical predictions are reduced in the presence of oscillation . by adopting the neutrino oscillation parameters deduced from the fits on the atmospheric neutrino data @xcite ,",
    "the effect is always larger for lighter neutralinos . for @xmath0",
    "the reduction is between 0.5 and 0.8 for @xmath49 gev and less than about 20% for @xmath50 gev .",
