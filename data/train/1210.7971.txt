    "we concluded that a straight colour cut is not a viable approach to take , as etgs tend to be red , but not all red galaxies tend to be etgs .",
    "for example , many red spirals were present in such a cut .",
    "also , as our sub - mm approach picks out dusty galaxies , we may expect some blue etgs to be present . a sersic index cut at @xmath23.5 seemed reasonable , but a concentration index cut of @xmath22.86 gave us a sample which matched best with the optical visually classified etgs in the nair @xmath3 abraham control sample .",
    "we have applied our concentration index criterion , with additional criteria for redshift , ellipticity and apparent effective radius , to our gama / h - atlas data . with the addition of visual classifications to root out any remaining late - type galaxies ,",

    "modified planck functions were fit to the sub - mm regime of our sample s observed data . the resultant cold dust temperatures and masses are displayed in fig.[fig2 ] .",

    "fig.[fig2 ] shows that the sub - mm sample contains some etgs with high dust masses and mainly low dust temperatures compared to these references .",
    "the low dust temperatures will need to be checked with additional flux points , including pacs data , covering the peak of the cool emission . unlike the h - atlas galaxies which have been studied up to this point , our sample exhibits only intermediate stellar masses , not high stellar masses ."
