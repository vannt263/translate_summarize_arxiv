    "thus , this relation depicts a very significant characteristic at the onset of bec , that the @xmath129 curves are always convex for bose system in condensed phase .",

    "theorem a dictates that @xmath3 becomes discontinuous when @xmath132 for isotropic potential , also conspicuous in figure 2 ( b ) .",

    "the calculation done by kim @xmath4 @xmath2 shows how the condensed phases can be different , depending on the dimensionality for free bose gas .",
    "the dimensional dependence of discontinuity of the @xmath9 th derivative of @xmath3 indicates hidden hierarchy of the condensation transition with changing fractional dimensionality .",
    "theorem 4.3 generalizes this result for trapped systems indicating a similar hierarchy where we find the class of @xmath151 derivative of @xmath152 depends on @xmath53 .",
