    "are measurements of the mass of a colored particle with a precision better than @xmath6 possible using jets , or is this an irreducible uncertainty ?",

    "understanding the answers to the above questions is important .    to achieve a high precision top - mass , measurements exploit kinematic information by considering leptons + jets , @xmath8 , or the associated dilepton or all - hadronic channels , and use monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to reconstruct observables sensitive to the top - quark four vector , and",
    "hence @xmath9 .",

    "the sets @xmath12 and @xmath13 depend on the jet - algorithm and cuts . in such analyses",
    "it might appear natural to think of the reconstructed top - mass as being associated to the pole - mass @xmath14 , since it is designed for sensitivity to the on - shell region @xmath15 .",
    "however , as we will argue in section  5 below , it is not @xmath14 that is being measured by the tevatron analyses .    the relation of the pole - mass and any other lagrangian mass - scheme @xmath16 can be expressed as a perturbative series , @xmath17 where @xmath18^n \\ln^k\\!\\big(\\frac{\\mu}{r}\\big),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 a dimension-1 scale intrinsic to the scheme , and @xmath20 finite numerical coefficients .",

    "[ fig : sig ] ( top ) , or b ) from measurements at different @xmath38 s with a linear extrapolation that removes the soft - radiation effect as in fig .  [ fig : sig ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the situation at high energy hadron colliders is somewhat different from @xmath130 collisions due to the more complicated initial state and because the jet algorithms needed for the reconstruction of the invariant mass distribution are implemented in terms of mc programs rather than a factorization theorem . nevertheless , the principles upon which final state interactions in mc s for tops are based , have close analogues with elements in the factorization theorem  ( [ fthm ] ) .",
    "these analogies make it obvious that the top quark masses contained in mc programs , which are measured at the tevatron and lhc , are very similar to the jet mass definition we discussed above .",
    "moreover , the tevatron top mass measurements are statistically dominated by the reconstructed invariant mass distribution in the peak region , which allows more reliable statements to be made about the scheme of the tevatron top mass .",
    "the final state shower in mc s describes the perturbative aspects of collinear and soft radiation of partons .",
    "starting at transverse scales of order the momentum transfer of the primary partons the parton shower evolves the system down to the shower cutoff scale @xmath131 which is typically in the 1  gev range . for the top quark the width @xmath132  gev provides an additional natural shower cutoff for radiation off the top quark . in the factorization theorem  ( [ fthm ] ) the same physics",
    "is described by the renormalization group running of the factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the partonic contributions in the soft function and , in particular , the jet functions @xmath42 .",
    "as far as the question of the mass scheme implemented in mc s is concerned , the analogue of the shower cutoff @xmath131 is the modification of the jet functions @xmath42 due to the residual mass term @xmath46 , which subtracts low - energy fluctuations of the jet functions , absorbing them into the mass definition .",
    "it is therefore the implementation of the parton shower for the top quark and the size of the shower cutoff @xmath131 which determines the top mass definition used in the mc s .",
    "another important ingredient of mc s is the description of nonperturbative effects in the hadronization process through models that depend on many parameters .",
    "these are fixed from reference processes . for the factorization theorem  ( [ fthm ] )",
    "the analogue of the hadronization models is the soft function which can be determined from event - shapes involving light quark jets .",
    "we note that at hadron colliders the treatment of nonperturbative effects is more involved due to the partonic initial state , and does not necessarily lead to a positive shift of the peak position .    for hadron collisions at the tevatron and the lhc",
    "there are additional complications due to for example underlying events , more involved combinatorial background and initial state showers .",
    "however , if such effects are modeled correctly in the mc s they do not affect the correspondences mentioned above .",
    "we therefore conclude that the top quark mass that is implemented in mc s has the property @xmath133 + \\ldots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath134  gev .",
    "the exact coefficients in the series on the rhs depend on how the parton shower is implemented and are currently unknown . however , it is reasonable to assume that they are of order one .",
    "numerically , the mc masses are therefore quite close to the jet mass scheme defined in  ( [ dmj ] ) for which @xmath135 or to any other short - distance mass scheme that falls in the category of  ( [ mrdef ] ) with @xmath135 .",
    "a good way to illustrate the numerical size of the scheme uncertainty due to the ignorance of the coefficients in  ( [ mcmassdef ] ) is the associated uncertainty in the @xmath136 top mass @xmath137 .",
    "this uncertainty is essential for fits of electroweak precision observables and the resulting indirect higgs mass bounds . to avoid large logarithms in the perturbative relation of the mc or the jet mass ( with @xmath138  gev ) and the @xmath136 mass ( with @xmath139 ) , one can use the evolution equation in @xmath19 from ref .",
    "conversions involving the @xmath136 mass @xmath137 are particularly simple when the r - evolution is carried out with the msr - mass scheme @xmath140 , which is a short - distance mass scheme that also falls in the category of  ( [ mrdef ] ) and has in addition the property @xmath141 .",
    "the msr mass definition is obtained from the @xmath25-pole series by a simple replacement rule  @xcite .",
    "we can identify the msr mass at a low scale @xmath19 in the 1  gev range with the mass that is contained in mc programs , @xmath142 the variation of @xmath19 between 1 and 9  gev parameterizes our remaining ignorance .",
    "we now identify @xmath143 with the tevatron measurement @xmath144  @xcite . the result for @xmath137",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : m ] .",
    "the vertical error bars on the tevatron mass are the experimental uncertainties and the horizontal error bars reflect the current scheme uncertainty due to eq .",
    "( [ mteverror ] ) .",
    "the three red lines show the 3-loop r - evolution of the scheme uncertainty with the msr mass .",
    "the intersection of the red lines with the black line that shows the equation @xmath145 , gives the @xmath136 top mass @xmath146  gev  @xcite .",
    "here the first error is the combined experimental one , and the second error is from the scheme uncertainty in the tevatron mass .",
    "the above correspondence between the shower mc and the factorization theorem is compelling for large @xmath147 events where top quarks are fast .",
    "a potential concern is that tops at the tevatron are produced with predominantly small @xmath147 and are therefore slow .",
    "however given that the mc framework applies to this situation , the concept of the top - mass intrinsic to the mc should be independent of whether the mc is applied to energetic tops or to soft tops , and hence the correspondence we have discussed should be applicable for the tevatron as well .",
    "further study of this is warranted .",
