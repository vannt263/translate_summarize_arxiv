    "evidence available in the 1960s and 1970s from regions of active star formation in nearby galaxies , and our own milky way , suggested that star forming galaxies would be strong sources of thermal infrared radiation , and implied that regions of dust and molecular clouds should be found within them @xcite .",
    "it was then predicted that this dust reprocessed redshifted starlight from distant galaxies , would form a far  infrared background ( firb ) signal @xcite .    with the advent of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) in the 1980s",
    "hundreds of previously undetected galaxies were discovered , which emit up to 95 per cent of their total luminosity in the infrared @xcite .",
    "this indicated significant dust reprocessing of their starlight and implied that star formation rates previously calculated from rest frame optical / uv luminosities were only a lower limit .",
    "follow up redshift surveys , such as qdot @xcite , showed that these galaxies were far more numerous in the past ( e.g. @xcite ) , requiring stronger cosmological evolution than had previously been predicted by conventional models for the passive evolution of galaxies and providing support was building for models in which starbursts are important evolutionary mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the iras results allowed far tighter limits to be put on the level of the predicted far  infrared background .",
    "@xcite predicted that the background should be detectable by the cosmic background explorer satellite ( cobe ) at 100 @xmath0 and noted that discovering its exact level would allow further refinement of evolutionary models .",
    "no - evolution models placed a lower limit on the predicted background level , while detection of a strong background would indicate the existence of a population of objects with significant cosmological evolution .",
    "the firb was finally discovered by @xcite in the whole sky survey taken by firas on cobe just as @xcite had predicted .",
    "@xcite found a signal which could be explained by the thermal emission from particles with temperatures of 20 and 12 k with emissivities of @xmath6 and 5 k with an emissivity of @xmath7 .",
    "this detection has fueled a new generation of galaxy evolution models but it is clear that to further differentiate between them we must understand the nature of the objects which contribute to the far  infrared background .      the firback survey was carried out jointly with the elais team at 175 @xmath0 using isophot @xcite on the infrared space observatory ( iso ) @xcite .",
    "this survey aimed to resolve the firb into discrete sources and also allow studies of firb fluctuations .",
    "firback covered 3 main fields [ south marano , n1 and n2 ] covering a total area of 4 deg@xmath8 .",
    "the final source catalogue contains 106 sources with fluxes between 180 mjy and 2.4 jy and a supplementary catalogue containing 90 sources with fluxes 135 - 180 mjy @xcite .",
    "the northern fields lie within the previously defined elais n1 and n2 survey regions whose selection was based primarily on their low galactic cirrus emission ( as quantified by iras 100 @xmath0 emission ) and high visibility , given iso s orbit .",
    "this choice of fields allows multiwavelength follow ",
    "up thus providing a global view of galaxy evolution .",
    "there have been several suggestions as to the nature of these 175 @xmath0 iso sources .",
    "two sources were examined in detail in the optical and near - ir by @xcite who found two nearby ( @xmath9 ) galaxies with characteristic temperatures of @xmath1030 k and @xmath1050 k and bolometric luminosities ( 40200 @xmath0 ) of @xmath11 @xmath2 .",
    "these galaxies were classified as ulirgs with morphologies suggesting the early stages of mergers adding weight to arguments for interactions sparking periods of increased star formation .",
    "a sample of iso 175 @xmath0 sources were also examined at sub  mm and near - ir wavelengths by @xcite who found a bimodal galaxy population : one population of normal star forming galaxies at @xmath12 and a second more luminous population at @xmath13",
    ". there has been spectroscopic follow  up of the brightest 175 @xmath0 sources in the firback south marano field @xcite which were found to be nearby ( @xmath14 ) , heavily extincted ( @xmath15 with extreme cases up to @xmath16 ) , star forming galaxies with moderate star formation rates ( a few 10 @xmath17 ) .",
    "these were classified at lirgs , with @xmath18 @xmath2 .",
    "we have gone one step further by seeking associations for all 55 n2 @xmath19 iso sources in the firback survey with optical sources from the int  wfs catalogues in four bands ( _ g,r,i,z _ ) , the other elais survey wavelengths ( _ j , h , k _ , 15 , 6.7 , 90 @xmath0 , 20 cm ) and iras wavelengths ( 60 , 100 @xmath0 ) .",
    "( also see @xcite for investigations into sources in the n1 field ) . in doing",
    "so we are able to gain a multiwavelength view of the nature of these interesting objects .",
    "we have compared their seds with those predicted by the radiative transfer models of @xcite to provide further insight into their properties .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : section [ sec : data ] describes the multiwavelength data , section [ sec : ids ] discusses the methods of associating the multiwavelength data with the 175 @xmath0 iso sources , provides a summary of the results of this process and briefly describes the optical properties of the sources .",
    "the radiative transfer models are described in section [ sec : models ] and secton [ sec : seds ] describes the comparison of the sources seds with predictions from the models .",
    "the resulting star formation rates , far  infrared luminosities and dust temperature estimations are given in sections [ sec : sfrs ] and [ sec : dust ] .",
    "section [ sec : evolution ] provides a summary of current evolutionary models , while conclusions and a discussion are provided in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "an appendix provides details of individual associations .",
    "optical associations were sought in _",
    "r _ data from the int ",
    "wfs @xcite which used the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma , spain ) .",
    "the wfc is formed by four 4k x 2k ccds .",
    "the arrays have 13.5 @xmath0 pixels corresponding to 0.33 arcsec / pixel at the telescope prime focus and each one covers an area on the sky of 22.8 arcmin x 11.4 arcmin . the total sky coverage per exposure for the array",
    "is therefore 0.29 deg@xmath8 .",
    "gaps between detectors are typically 20 arcsec and optical observaions are carried out allowing for a 10 per cent overlap between adjacent pointings for photometric purposes .",
    "the elais - n2 optical field is approximately 9 deg@xmath8 .",
    "the survey has a typical completeness limit of 23 mag ( vega ) in wavebands _ u , g , r , i _ and _ z_. however , there are no _ u_band data for our sources the n2 field .",
    "all optical magnitudes were calculated directly from the int  wfs data .",
    "associations were then sought with sources in the multiwavelength elais band - merged catalogue at 6.7 , 15 and 90 @xmath0 with associated data at _ u , g,r,i,z , j , h , k _ and 20 cm @xcite which by then had become available .",
    "this was a survey carried out using iso covering a total of 12 deg@xmath8 over five main fields , three in the north ( n1 , n2 , n3 ) and two in the south ( s1,s2 ) .",
    "these areas were also surveyed at 20 cm with the very large array ( vla ) and at .",
    "the separate wavebands making up the elais survey each comprise an independent survey , the band  merged catalogue simply brings together the results of each of their final anayses , as described in section [ sec : ids ] .    where detections were not found at 15 and 90 @xmath0 upper limits were extracted directly from the survey maps ( @xcite ) to a @xmath20 level using aperture photometry with an aperture size of 6 arcsec and 90 arcsec respectively .",
    "an aperture correction was applied to the 15 @xmath0 upper limits since 40 per cent of the point spread function ( psf ) lies outside the aperture .",
    "iras 100 and 60 @xmath0 fluxes or upper limits ( @xmath20 ) were obtained at the galaxy optical positions using the iras scan processing and inegration ( scanpi ) internet facility to provide extra constraints on the source seds .",
    "associations were also sought in the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) 850 @xmath0 @xcite and max ",
    "planck millimeter bolometer array ( mambo ) 1200 @xmath0 @xcite catalogues within 10 and 3 arcsec of the optical position of the 175 @xmath0 counterpart , respectively .",
    "however , none were found for any of our 175 @xmath0 sources .",
    "the positional accuracy of the iso 175 @xmath0 sources was determined using simulated maps by @xcite . since 93 per cent of artificial sources brighter than 180 mjy in the simulated maps",
    "were recovered within a radius of 50 arcsec , associations were sought for the n2 sources within a 90 arcsec radius .",
    "this ensured the capture within the source error circle of the true source position for even faint source ids .",
    "associations were made using a likelihood ratio technique described in full in @xcite . in brief , the likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of finding the true counterpart to a particular source at the source position with that magnitude to the probability of finding an object of the same magnitude there by chance . in terms of flux",
    "this takes the form : @xmath21 where q(f ) is the flux probability distribution function for the source counterparts , e(x , y ) is the probability distribution of positional offsets between the source and object and n(f ) is the surface density of objects per unit flux interval .",
    "e(x , y ) was taken to be a gaussian distribution with @xmath22 arcsec .",
    "this choice prevents too many objects being assigned moderate likelihood ratios , without excluding objects which should be considered or including objects which should not .",
    "the function q(f ) is unknown for a new source population , as is the case here , and , as shown in @xcite , an empirical estimate is very noisy for a small number of sources , q(f ) was taken to be a constant .",
    "the probability , @xmath23 , that a fictitious , randomly - placed source would have a likeliest assocation with an optical object in the catalogue producing a likelihood ratio at least as high as the source - object pair in question was then calculated .",
    "thus good associations have low values of @xmath23 , corresponding to a high probability that the association is correct . the object with the lowest @xmath23",
    "was chosen as the source optical i d , with a cut off for non - association of @xmath24 .",
    "this is an arbitrary value chosen by inspection of the @xmath23 distribution , see figure [ fig : like_pran ] .",
    "it is expected @xcite that true ids will cluster at low @xmath23 values with a tail of objects reaching to high @xmath23 values due to sources without good associations in the optical catalogue , as seen in the plot .",
    "counterparts were also sought in the band - merged elais multiwavelength catalogue @xcite using a search radius of 60 arcsec consistent , with the band merging procedure used in the collation of this catalogue . the individual wavelength elais catalogues were merged , taking into account the different positional accuracies of each catalogue , sequentially as follows .",
    "the 15 @xmath0 and 20 cm catalogues @xcite were first identified with optical objects from the int  wfs catalogue @xcite and then merged according to their optical positions using a search radius of 2 arcsec .",
    "these were then matched with the 6.7 @xmath0 catalogue using a search radius of 5 arcsec and those 6.7 @xmath0 sources not merged were associated with optical counterparts .",
    "these were then merged with the 90 @xmath0 and 175 @xmath0 sources @xcite using search radii of 30 arcsec and 60 arcsec respectively . where these were matched with more than one catalogue entry the less probable assocations were flagged in the catalogue .",
    "after this those sources that were still unmatched were associated with optical counterparts .",
    "these optical counterparts were sought by @xcite independently from our work and the resulting optical ids were then compared .",
    "in summary , we sought associations on the basis of applying the likelihood ratio method to the optical data alone , then , with the availablility of the final band - merged elais catalogue , we reassessed them .",
    "our final optical and elais wavelength i d list was drawn up using the following criteria :    1 .",
    "if our optical i d , selected using the likelihood ratio method , agreed with the elais optical i d to which the 175 @xmath0 flux had been assigned then both the elais optical i d and band - merged data were accepted .",
    "if the elais optical i d had a @xmath25 ( cut off value see earlier ) for association with the 175 @xmath0 iso source then the elais optical i d and band - merged data were accepted .",
    "3 .   if our optical i d and elais optical i d were in fact the same galaxy but had different entries in the int ",
    "wfs catalogue due to the way the image analyser splits up bright galaxies into multiple sources , then the band - merged elais data and optical i d were accepted .",
    "if our optical i d had @xmath25 but no optical elais catalogue match then the source has optical and 175 @xmath0 data only ( it may also have iras detections / upper limits and 60 @xmath0 and 90 @xmath0 upper limits ) 5 .",
    "if our optical i d had @xmath26 the source has no association    for sources in the main n2 firback catalogue ( @xmath27 mjy ) , which contains 27 detections , we made 22 confident optical associations with galaxies , 7 of which agree exactly with the elais optical i d ( category i. ) and 6 for which we accepted the elais optical i d ( categories ii . or iii . ) .",
    "nine confident optical associations were made for sources in the supplementary catalogue ( @xmath28 mjy , 28 sources ) , 2 of which agreed with the elais optical i d ( category i. ) and 2 of which where the elais optical i d was accepted ( categories ii . or iii . ) .",
    "there also were two sources in the supplementary catalogue with stellar ids , one of which agreed with the elais optical i d ( category i. ) and one of which was an accepted elais optical i d ( category ii . or iii . ) .",
    "the data for the identified sources are given in table 1 . and",
    "notes on individual sources are given in the appendix , including @xmath23 values of any other plausible identifications .",
    "the identified sources were morphologically classified by visual inspection .",
    "i_-band images from the int ",
    "wfs , and followed the same classification method as @xcite .",
    "the galaxies were classified using the classical hubble sequence : e , e / s0 , s0 , s0/a , sa , sa / b , sb , sb / c , sc , irr . for the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on hst , for galaxies with redshift of around unity , visual classifications of this kind have a typical random error of 25 per cent , this reduces to 6 per cent when galaxies are classified in two broad cathegories : 1 .",
    "early - type , 2 . spirals and irregulars .",
    "these errors were estimated from the average scatter found in classifications by four acs team members .",
    "the majority of our sources are spiral galaxies , we also have a number of s0 galaxies , 2 sets of interacting galaxies , 2 pairs and 2 irregulars , the morphology of 6 sources was unable to be deduced from the images .",

    "redshifts are discussed in more detail in section [ sec : seds ] .",
    "it was initially attempted to fit the data to the grasil model seds of @xcite .",
    "these provide six templates for nearby galaxies , three starbursts ( arp 220 , m82 and ngc 6090 ) and three sprials ( m100 , m51 and ngc 6946 ) .",
    "however , these templates did not describe the data well .",
    "instead radiative transfer models of @xcite and @xcite were employed to generate sed predictions for comparison with the data .",
    "these are able to model both cirrus and starburst emission or a combination of the two .",
    "the models used are briefly described below .",
    "ultraviolet to submillimetre emission from stars embedded in interstellar dust in galaxies known as the infrared cirrus component are modelled .",
    "the model consists of the input stellar radiation field , an interstellar dust model and the radiative transfer treatment of the interaction between the two which generates the output sed .",
    "the input stellar radiation field is taken from the galaxy isochrone synthesis spectral evolution library ( gissel , @xcite ) .",
    "this gives the radiation from a mass of stars from the ultraviolet to near - infrared as a function of time .",
    "stars form in molecular clouds and at the early stages of their lives remain inside them during which time their radiation is absorbed by the dust and reprocessed to the infrared . during this phase of their life",
    "the model uses the code of @xcite to compute the radiation emitted by stars and dust .",
    "the cloud is assumed to disperse @xmath35 years after star formation . before this",
    ", however , due to non - spherical evolution of the cloud , a fraction of the starlight @xmath36 may have been able to escape without dust absorption .",
    "this occurs a time @xmath37 after star formation .",
    "the radiation field within the galaxy is modelled to be due to a large number of randomly oriented molecular clouds whose average emission , for stars in the age range @xmath37 to @xmath35 years , is approximately @xmath38 were @xmath39 is the emission from a giant spherical molecular cloud @xcite and @xmath40 is the emission from the stellar population @xcite . the emission of stars younger than @xmath37 is simply @xmath39 and those older than @xmath35 years @xmath40 .",
    "the fraction of general starlight that escapes the galaxy unattenuated is also parameterised in a leak variable .",
    "the dust temperature is determined by the intensity of the stellar radiation field and is characterised in the model by the ratio of the bolometric intensity of the radiation field to that in the stellar radiation field in the solar neighbourhood @xcite , @xmath41 .",

    "the detection of the far  infrared background in 1996 led to a re  evaluation of galaxy evolution models .",
    "one of the earliest new models to emerge was that of @xcite which used the firb to place constraints on models for the cosmic star formation history and therefore the production of the background signal .",
    "this paper concluded that stellar nucleosynthesis is able to account for a firb intensity not far from the upper limit set by the cobe detection .",
    "it also suggested substantially higher star formation rates at higher redshifts than suggested by optical data .",
    "it is now fairly well established that infrared  selected galaxies undergo extremely high rates of evolution compared to measurements at other wavelengths over the approximate redshift range @xmath51 .",
    "chary and elbaz ( 2001 ) models imply that about 80 per cent of the cosmic infrared background was produced between @xmath52 compared to only 30 per cent of the 850 @xmath0 background .",
    "also the dust enshrouded star formation rate peaks at @xmath53 at a value of @xmath54 and at least 70 per cent of this star formation takes place in infrared luminous galaxies with @xmath55 .",
    "in fact @xmath56 per cent of 15 @xmath0 sources examined by @xcite were found to be in this category of luminous infrared galaxies and have star formation rates of @xmath57 .",
    "the comoving density of infrared light due to these galaxies was over 40 times larger at @xmath58 than it is today .",
    "models of the cosmic infrared background produced by @xcite , that are able to fit number counts and unresolved anisotropies imply that the luminosity function must change dramatically with redshift .",
    "these also show rapid evolution of high luminosity sources up to z=1 .",
    "it has been suggested that this strong evolution is due to bimodal star formation , one long lived quiescent , passive phase and one enhanced starburst phase triggered by interactions and mergers ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also suggest that the interpretation of evolution with redshift could be biased due to an increase in the probability of detecting a galaxy during an active phase caused by both an increase of the rate of interactions , in part due to the geometry of the expanding universe , and an increase of the infrared luminosity due to more abundant fuel available in the past .",
    "however , @xcite point out that at @xmath9 the coldest and most dusty galaxies will have the greatest flux densities for an equivalent infrared luminosity . at @xmath59 the firback 175 @xmath0 detection will lie bluewards of the peak in the restframe black body spectrum and dust temperatures of @xmath60 k will no longer have significant effects on the observed flux . therefore at higher redshifts , the flux limited firback survey will be biased towards cooler galaxies .",
    "models such as @xcite and @xcite do not explicitly incorporate such cold luminous galaxies which are preferentially selected in our survey for @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite examined two of the 175 @xmath0 selected iso sources and indentified them as unusually cold ulirgs with dust temperatures of @xmath61 k which is significantly lower than the usual ulirg dust temperature of @xmath62 k. cold , dusty yet luminous objects suggest large masses of dust heated at a moderate intensity . the existence of such sources may seriously affect the interpretation of scuba sources if they are numerous at high  z .",
    "since many models rapidly evolve a hot ulirg population to the local luminosity function they may predict a false redshift distribution if these cold sources are not considered .",
    "we have found bright galaxy optical identifications for 31 out of the 55 n2 iso 175 @xmath0 sources and stellar identifications for 2 sources .",
    "17 of those with galaxy optical ids were associated with sources from the band - mergerd elais catalogue .",
    "we then compard the spectral energy distributions of the sources with predictions from the radiative transfer models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "22 of the 175 @xmath0 sources have not been confidently associated with optical counterparts and therefore their nature is still unknown .",
    "however , only 4 of these sources are in the main firback catalogue , the remaining 18 are listed in the complementary catalogue which contains detections at lower signal to noise and therefore they may just be spurious detections .",
    "however , these could also be due to sources having multiple ids or them being associated with heavily extincted objects which were not in the optical catalogue .",
    "24 galaxies have been classed as star bursting .",
    "they have a range of far  infrared luminosities from @xmath63 to @xmath64 corresponding to a range of star formation rates from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "although those at the lower end of this range are not forming stars at a dramatic rate their small starburst component is dominating over the existing population at far  infrared wavelengths .",
    "this implies that the 175 @xmath0 firback sample contains a significant number of low mass galaxies .",
    "the majority of these galaxies are spirals and a number are s0 galaxies .",
    "sources fn2 005 , 011 , cfn2 034 and cfn2 049 have @xmath67 and high star formation rates , we therefore suggest that these are in the low redshift tail of the rapidly evolving ulirg population .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of @xcite who found one sixth of their 175 @xmath0 sample to fall into this category .",
    "we also suggest that those galaxies with moderate star formation rates and far  infrared luminosities of @xmath68 at moderate z ( @xmath69 ) are lirgs ( fn2 002 , 007 , 008 , 010 , 016 , 017 , 022 , 025 and cfn2 047 ) .",
    "those with @xmath70 are more normal galaxies perhaps with lower masses ( fn2 003 , 004 , 012 , 018 , 019 , 021 , cfn2 029 , 030 , 038 , 039 , 044 ) .",
    "the estimated dust temperatures of the starburst galaxies are 30 - 49 k which is relatively low compared to that of standard ulirgs which have @xmath71 k. the most luminous of these galaxies also have large dust masses adding weight to the suggestion that cold , dusty , luminous objects have large masses of dust heated at a moderate intensity @xcite .",
    "a further 6 sources have non - starburst seds .",
    "these sources have far  infrared luminosities of @xmath72 and star formation rates of @xmath73 .",
    "we suggest that these are quiescently star forming galaxies ( fn2 000 , 001 , 015 , 020 , 023 , 036 ) .",
    "these galaxies have low dust temperatures of @xmath74 k and dust masses of @xmath75 .",
    "3 of these galaxies are spirals , 1 is an intereacting galaxy pair , 1 is either an irregular or a spiral with tidal tail and the morphology of the remaining source was unable to be deduced .",
    "@xcite predicted 62 per cent of 175 @xmath0 sources would have @xmath76 and the remainder @xmath77 .",
    "we find only one 175 @xmath0 source with @xmath27 mjy with @xmath78 and therefore have @xmath79 per cent with @xmath76 .",
    "however , our mix of higher redshift ulirgs and lower redshift starburst galaxies is in good qualitative agreement with the predictions of the @xcite starburst templates as adopted by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also state that to gain agreement between their models and observations they require a cold local population which is what has been found .",
    "there has also been recent investigation into the submillimetre properties of the local universe through the scuba local universe galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "this survey found a population of galaxies with @xmath80 and dust masses of @xmath81 .",
    "the population was fitted with a two - component dust model to discover cold dust temperatures of @xmath82 k and hot dust temperatures of @xmath83 k. it is clear that the local 175 @xmath0 firback population has very similar properties to these galaxies .",
    "the sources of the far  infrared background are therefore offering a stepping stone between high redshift scuba galaxies and the local universe .",
