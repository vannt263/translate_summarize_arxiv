    "parton recombination as a new higher twist phenomenon was first discussed in the qcd evolution process by gribov , levin , ryskin [ 1 ] and mueller , qiu [ 2 ] in their pioneering works .",
    "this evolution equation is called the glr equation .    an interesting effect of",
    "parton recombination is screening or shadowing . in the case of higher number densities of partons , for example in the small @xmath0 region ,",
    "the gluons can overlap spatially and annihilate .",
    "therefore , one expects that the growth of the gluon density with @xmath1 will be suppressed by gluon recombination .",
    "these suppression factors from the negative contributions due to gluon recombination are calculated in the glr equation using the agk ( abramovsky , gribov , kancheli ) cutting rules [ 3 ] .",
    "assuming that the agk cutting rules are valid in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) in the small @xmath0 region , one finds that the relative weights of cuts through two , one and zero ladders are @xmath2 , as illustrated in fig . 1 . due to these quantitative predictions of the suppression of parton number densities at small @xmath0 ,",
    "the glr equation was extensively used to explore the structure of the nucleon and new perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) effects in the past years .    however , the applications of agk cutting rules in the glr equation have some drawbacks .",
    "for example , the cut lines break the correlation between the recombining partons according to the agk cutting rules in the glr equation ( fig .",
    "1 ) . as we will show in this work , the correlation among the initial partons in the qcd recombination equation should be preserved . on the other hand ,",
    "two - to - two parton processes may be associated with ir - divergences just as are the one - to - two processes in the dokshitzer - gribove- lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equation [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "although the agk cutting rules provide simple relations between the cross sections of hadron - hadron interactions for different types of reggeon cuts , however , the sum of cut graphs according to the agk cutting rules can not cancel ir - divergences .",
    "the reason is that the difference of the contributions between the positive graph and the negative graph is only a weight , according to the agk cutting rules . as we know that the virtual diagrams are necessary for cancellation of ir - divergences in the dglap equation .",
    "we will show in this work that above mentioned ir - divergences in two - to - two processes also can be canceled by the sum of virtual diagrams , which are neglected in the glr equation .    in this work ,",
    "we reconsider parton recombination in the qcd evolution equation without the agk cutting rules . to this end",
    ", we first point out that a new scale ( the recombination scale ) exists in the parton recombination processes",
    ". we will give a definition of the recombination order of the process .",
    "then , we propose the bare probe - vertex approximation .",
    "we find that several more diagrams , which are neglected in the glr equation , should be included in the qcd equation of the parton fusion .",
    "we try to find a simple way to calculate those cut diagrams in time - ordered perturbation theory ( topt ) . through a new derivation of the dglap evolution equation , we present simple connections among the different cut diagrams .",
    "we shall show that both the shadowing - antishadowing and momentum conservation are the natural results of the theory . as an interesting result , our new equation has different structure from the glr equation .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we give some definitions related to the parton model . in section 3 the sum of the cut diagrams at the bare probe - vertex approximation",
    "is proposed . in section 4",
    "we give a new derivation of the dglap equation . through this example",
    ", we try to show the connections among the relative cut graphs at the leading recombination order .",
    "the new evolution equations incorporating the parton recombination are derived in sections 57 .",
    "section 8 contains the discussions and concluding remarks .",
    "according to pqcd , a parton can always independently split into two partons",
    ". however , except in the pqcd dynamics , the recombination of partons depends on the overlap probability of their wave functions .",
    "therefore , we need a new physical quality to characterize parton recombination .    for example , consider an amplitude with two initial partons . according to dimensional analysis ,",
    "the hadronic part of the amplitude should contain a factor @xmath3 , where @xmath4 has dimension of length .",
    "now we incorporate the factor @xmath5 arising from the partonic part of the amplitude to form a dimensionless quality @xmath6 .",
    "we call this the recombination factor . for example , the recombination factor of the process with two initial correlated partons is @xmath7 .",
    "one can schematically think of @xmath7 as the overlap probability of two partons , where @xmath5 is the scale of a parton at momentum transfer @xmath1 and @xmath4 is the maximum correlation length of two partons .",
    "usually , @xmath4 is regarded as the scale of target or the scale of the `` hot spots '' , if they exist in the proton",
    ". this definition can be generalized to the case of the amplitudes including @xmath8-initial partons ; the recombination factor in this case is @xmath9 if the fusing partons are paired .    in this paper",
    ", we consider only the recombination processes at the leading order level , that is , at @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we choose to study the following basic amplitudes as shown in fig . 2 : ( a ) @xmath11 , ( b ) @xmath12 and ( c ) @xmath13 , with the recombination factors @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath7 , respectively . in fig .",
    "2 we have omitted the distinction of the parton flavors ; the dark circles indicate qcd interactions among the correlating partons .",
    "we see that the amplitudes involving parton recombination contain the double scales : @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "we shall perform the calculations at a given order-@xmath17 and order-@xmath18 in two steps .",
    "first , we calculate the process at the order of @xmath7 . in this case , the dark circles in fig .",
    "2 are regarded as the elemental sub - processes .",
    "the reason is that the decomposition of the circle part will break the parton correlation and reduce the order of the recombination .",
    "the second step is to calculate the sub - processes at order-@xmath10 in pqcd .",
    "we will use topt in this work .",
    "usually , topt is equivalent to the standard covariant perturbation theory [ 7 ] . we shall call this topt as the normal topt ( ntopt ) , where the time lines divide every basic vertex along the time - order . in topt ,",
    "the internal lines and the virtual particles are expressed by external lines and effective real particles respectively .",
    "therefore , topt can also be used to describe amplitudes involving complex vertices , where the part between two neighboring time lines can contain a complex vertex .",
    "we define such a topt as an anomalous topt ( atopt ) .",
    "obviously , atopt is not equivalent to ntopt : they have different energy deficits .",
    "on the other hand , there are energy - momentum correlation between two neighboring complex vertices in atopt ; therefore , the vertex in atopt is not really factorized .",
    "we take the physical axial gauge , where the light - like vector @xmath19 fixes the gauge as @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the gluon field .",
    "the parton number densities are defined within the parton model description of the photon nucleon dis ( fig .",
    "3a ) as    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the number of quarks carrying momentum fraction between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 . formula ( 2.1 ) means that the interaction of a virtual photon with proton can be factorized as the soft part @xmath27 and hard part @xmath28 .",
    "according to the parton model ,    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the coefficient depending on @xmath32 and @xmath1 .",
    "the quark density can be defined as    @xmath33    on the other hand , using topt in the cut graph 3b , we have    @xmath34 @xmath35 ^ 2 [ \\frac{1}{2e_k}]^2 \\prod_x \\frac{d^3k_x}{(2\\pi)^32e_x}\\ ] ] @xmath36    comparing eqs .",
    "( 2.1 ) with ( 2.4 ) , we get the definitions of the quark number density    @xmath37 @xmath38 ^ 2 [ \\frac{1}{2e_k}]^2 \\prod_x \\frac{d^3k_x}{(2\\pi)^32e_x}. \\eqno(2.5)\\ ] ]    and the bare probe - parton vertex    @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41    in the topt - form .",
    "as we know , emission or absorption of quanta with zero - momentum may associate with the infrared ( ir ) divergence .",
    "however , the singular terms provide the leading contributions to the dis processes .",
    "therefore , a correct theory is ir - safe , where ir - divergences are canceled , while the leading contributions are retained .",
    "one way can to attain above two goals is to sum over cut diagrams belonging to the same time - ordered uncut graph , since these graphs have similar singular structure but may come up with opposite signs .",
    "deep inelastic scattering structure functions are the imaginary parts of the amplitudes for the forward ` compton ' scattering of the target with a probe . using the time - ordered perturbative expansion of the statement of the unitarity of the s - matrix , one can prove that the structure functions are associated with the sum of cut diagrams .",
    "these different cut graphs represent various possible sub - partonic processes due to the unitarity of the perturbative s - matrix [ 7 ] .",
    "therefore , the sum of cut graphs is necessary not only for infrared safety , but also for collecting the leading contributions and restoring the unitarity .",
    "the interesting and important question is , what are the minimum cut diagrams that must be summed for ir - safe calculation of an inclusive dis process at a given order ( for example , order @xmath42 in this work ) ?    to answer this question , let us consider a general inclusive dis process on target n. one can choose the cut diagrams according to following program : g(n ) stands for the time - ordered uncut diagram of the target n without probe vertices .",
    "we sum over possible cut diagrams of g(n ) :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the cut diagram with cut line @xmath45 ; @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the sub - graphs on the left and right of the cut line ; the subscript `` i '' means that we only consider following cut graphs which have the same observed quantities ( that is , the same structure of the intermediate state ) and which keep the original correlation among initial partons in @xmath48 .",
    "we use the probe to observe the parton distributions inside the target in dis .",
    "of course , we can not control the probing positions . in principle , in- and out - probe lines can be attached to the left- and right - hand of the cut line in all possible ways .",
    "let @xmath49 stand for the cut diagrams of the probe - target system , where @xmath50 labels the probe - parton vertices .",
    "thus , we shall sum over    @xmath51    obviously , the sum ( 3.2 ) is much larger than @xmath52 .",
    "now we try to find some approximation in the sum ( 3.2 ) . as we know that the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) is a good approximation for ir - safeness in the dglap equation at order-@xmath16 . in this approximation ,",
    "some of the renormalization effects are neglected in the physical gauge and the probe - vertex retains the bare - vertex form as in ( 2.6 ) . in this case ,    @xmath53    thus , the contributions from the nonlocal interactions of probe with partons are neglected at the leading approximation .",
    "we need only to sum part of cut graphs , in which the bare - probe vertex @xmath54 connects with the cut line , that is ,    @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57    in the dis processes with parton recombination .",
    "we call ( 3.4 ) as the bare probe - vertex approximation .",
    "we find that this approximation is also a satisfactory approximation in the dis processes with parton recombination .",
    "in fact , our interest is that the modifications of the parton recombination to the dglap equation , which has the probability explanation at the lla approximation . we shall show that the bare probe - vertex approximation is necessary for keeping the probability picture of the new evolution equation .",
    "we know that several methods can be used to derive the dglap evolution equations , however , the following new method illustrates more clearly the simple relations among the cut diagrams in the sum ( 3.4 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider the non - singlet case . according to ( 3.4 )",
    "we compute fig .",
    "4a with figs . 4b and 4c .",
    "figures 4b and 4c seem to change the observed quantity @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the transverse momentum of the final state partons , ( see fig .",
    "2a ) whose momenta are parametrized as @xmath60,\\ ] ] @xmath61,\\ ] ] @xmath62 .",
    "\\eqno(4.1)\\ ] ]    however , we will see that the contribution of an intermediate state can be replaced by @xmath63 , which is from the contribution of the loop and contributes @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , all the processes of fig . 4 have the same intermediate state structure .",
    "we proceed along the lines of ref.[8 ] .",
    "the change of the valence - quark - number density caused by gluon radiation can be written as ( see fig .",

    "we obtain the hard part    @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 ^ 2 [ \\frac{1}{2e_k}]^2\\frac{d^3l'}{(2\\pi)^32e_{l'}}. \\eqno(4.3)\\ ] ]    assuming that @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75    where",

    "now let us consider figs . 4b and 4c .",
    "as for the the real diagram , the contributions of fig .",

    "[ 11 ] : the virtual part of fig.4b corresponds to the renormalization of a parton propagator . only half of the probe - vertex connects with this parton line .",

    "the contributions of fig .",
    "4c is same as one of fig",
    "thus , the total contributions of the real- and virtual - diagrams are    @xmath91    in which    @xmath92    the two terms of the right - hand side in eq.(4.12 ) have a simple interpretation : the positive contribution arises from the splitting of higher momentum quarks , while the negative contribution results in the loss of the number of quarks due to its gluon radiation .",
    "the result ( 4.12 ) is the same as the probability form of the dglap equation for the nonsinglet part in ref .",
    "however , the new derivation clearly shows the following interesting properties in the inclusive dis processes : the contributions of the cut diagrams , which belong to a same time - ordered uncut graph in the sum ( 3.4 ) , have an identical integral kernel ( it is the parton splitting function in eq.(4.12 ) ) .",
    "this is a reason we use the topt form to perform our calculations .",
    "we shall examine this connection further in the parton recombination processes .",
    "so far we considered processes contributing to the usual dglap equation .",
    "we go on now to include parton recombination processes",
    ". the recombination processes contributing at leading order come from the terms , @xmath93 , @xmath94^*$ ] , and the cut diagrams according to ( 3.4 ) .    in this section",
    "we regard the partons as scalar particles ( i.e. , the @xmath95 model ) .",
    "the results can easily be generalized to the case of qcd partons and will be done later in section 7 .",

    "the sign in the first factor of ( 8.1 ) is determined by the energy deficits in ( 8.2 ) .",
    "for example , if a vertex pass through the cut line , the corresponding energy deficit will change its sign since @xmath272 as we have for example in ( 4.11 ) .",
    "2 .   the second factor takes a value of 1/2 if the probe - vertex inserts in the initial line as shown in ( 5.11 ) .",
    "@xmath273 is the direct result of the sum ( 3.4 ) .",
    "when the cut line moves its position , the contributions of the final states in ( 8.2 ) will change the momentum - symbols , but do nt change the structure of the intermediate state according to the sum - condition i in ( 3.4 ) .",
    "we also note that a virtual parton line has 4-dimensional integral and a real parton only a 3-dimensional integral in the covariant perturbation theory ; however , in topt , since the virtual partons are replaced by the effective real partons , the above mentioned differences are contained in the energy deficits .",
    "in particular , when the cut line moves to cutting line a @xmath274 from cutting a loop @xmath275-@xmath276 in the process of @xmath277 , we have similar expressions in ( 8.2 ) due to + @xmath278 + thus , as the cut line moves from cutting a loop to uncutting a loop , the integral kernel has the same form .",
    "the difference lies only in the cutting positions .",
    "the cut line can also cut the nonperturbative matrix elements with multi - initial partons .",
    "the reason is that the initial parton line on the light - cone can be moved from one - side of the cut to another side ( see fig.6 ) [ 13 , 14 ] .",
    "thus , we can use the same correlation function to represent the different hadronic parts and keep the same integral kernel .",
    "because of this important property , the sum ( 3.4 ) shall include more complex cut diagrams when we study parton fusion or recombination .",
    "finally , the matrix can been factorized to obtain the probability explanation ; the reason is that we used the bare probe - vertex approximation and the coefficient @xmath31 in ( 2.2 ) ( or @xmath100 in ( 5.2 ) ) is canceled in the calculations at this approximation .",
    "2 .   in the dglap equation , there are ir - divergences when a final - state gluon becomes soft .",
    "these ir - divergences can be taken care of by the sum of figs .",
    "4 according to eqs .",
    "( 3.4 ) and ( 8.1 ) .",
    "the divergences in ( 7.11 ) are canceled due to the symmetry at small x approximation [ 2 ] . however",
    ", a soft initial parton also may give rise to ir - divergences in the parton recombination process in a general case .",
    "we now show that such ir - divergences can be canceled by using the same method in the dglap equation .",
    "+ for example , take @xmath279 in fig .",
    "10 ; this implies @xmath280 .",
    "since the unpolarized structure functions only involve contributions from terms with even - twist , we have @xmath281 at @xmath279 .",
    "the momentum of @xmath282 and @xmath283 are determined by the down - vertices since the energy is not conserved in the up - vertices in the topt , i.e. , @xmath284 $ ] and @xmath285 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath286 and @xmath287 . according to ( 5.14 ) , we can find that + @xmath288 @xmath289 @xmath290 @xmath291=0 . \\eqno(8.5)\\ ] ] + therefore , ir - divergences can be canceled point - by - point at the ir - pole .",
    "3 .   obviously , the new evolution equations ( 7.4 ) , ( 7.5 ) , ( 7.8 ) and ( 7.9 ) are different from the glr equation [ 1,2 ] .",
    "it is interest that the properties and structure of the simplified low-@xmath0 form ( 7.14 ) is similar to a modified glr equation that has been obtained earlier in ref .",
    "however , two equations really have a different theoretical basis .",
    "the glr equation and its modified form are based upon the agk cutting rules .",
    "they sum three kinds of diagrams : cutting two - ladders , one - ladder and zero - ladder , respectively .",
    "the first ( see fig .",
    "1a ) is identical with our figs .",
    "5a , b , however , the cut lines in the latter two figures ( figs . 1b ,",
    "c ) break parton recombination and these processes should be inhibited .    in conclusion , parton recombination via qcd evolution equation",
    "is investigated using perturbative theory without the agk cutting rules .",
    "the contributions from different cut and interference diagrams are summed and infrared safeness and momentum conservation are established .",
    "time ordered perturbation theory is developed to establish the connections among different cut diagrams . as a consequence",
