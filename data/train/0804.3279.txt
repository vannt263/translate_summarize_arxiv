    "robustness is the invariance of phenotypes in the face of perturbation @xcite .",
    "it has been found to be present in living organisms at all levels of organizational complexity ranging from protein structure to small genetic circuits @xcite , genome - scale networks such as metabolic networks @xcite and even entire organisms . the evolutionary mechanism for the observed robustness has , however , been far from clear .",
    "the fundamental problem lies in determining whether robustness is an evolved property or intrinsic to genetic systems @xcite .",
    "an important stepping stone in solving this problem is establishing a theoretical understanding of under what conditions and to what extent natural selection can lead to the evolution of robustness .    according to the classic results of kimura and maruyama the average fitness of an",
    "asexually reproducing population ( in the limit of very large populations ) depends only on the mutation rate and is independent of the details of the fitness landscape @xcite .",
    "this result , however , as stated in their paper , only holds under the assumption that the fittest genotype does not have any neutral sites .",
    "if neutral mutations are taken into account the average fitness of the population will depend on both the mutation rate and the details of the fitness landscape @xcite .",
    "a growing body of work has explored the effect of neutral mutations on mutation - selection balance in infinite populations ( quasispecies ) and the balance of mutation - selection and drift in finite populations .",
    "quaispecies theory @xcite and simulations of finite populations of genotypes evolving with phenotype defined by rna secondary structure @xcite or simple lattice models of protein folding @xcite have established that a selective pressure to evolve robustness against mutations exists .",
    "the net effect of this selection pressure is to concentrate the population in regions of genotype space where the density of neutral sequences is higher , selecting individual sequences with an increased robustness against mutations .",
    "focusing on the case where all mutations are either neutral or lethal , van nimwegen _",
    "_ @xcite were able to solve the quasispecies equations and have demonstrated that the extent to which mutational robustness ( the average number of neutral neighbors ) evolves depends solely on the topology of the network of neutral genotypes .    in this work",
    "we examine the effects of recombination on the evolution of mutational robustness on networks of neutral genotypes and its dependence on the topology of the network , both in the limit of infinite populations and for finite populations .",
    "previous work on the effects of recombination on the population dynamics on networks of neutral genotypes is scarce , xia _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that in a simple lattice model of protein folding recombination leads to increased thermodynamic stability , but have not addressed the evolution of mutational robustness . in a wider context the effects of recombination on the evolution of robustness has been studied in highly simplified model developmental networks @xcite , where simulation results suggest that recombination between model gene networks imposes selection for mutational robustness , and that negative epistasis evolves as a byproduct of this selection . even though the evolution of mutational robustness in network of neutral genotypes under recombination has not been previously studied in detail the observation that recombination has a contracting property ( i.e.  it always creates genotypes that are within the boundaries of the current mutational cloud ) has lead to the expectation that it should concentrate the population in those regions of genotype space in which the density of neutral genotypes is highest @xcite .    in order to gauge the most general effects of recombination we define ensembles of random networks of neutral genotypes and demonstrate that recombination leads to the concentration of the population in highly neutral region of the genotype space , and hence the evolution of mutational robustness , in these generic neutral networks . turning to finite populations",
    "we show that similar to the case where only mutation is present ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) the evolution of mutational robustness requires the population to be sufficiently polymorphic ( i.e.  the product of the population size and the mutation rate , @xmath0 , must be greater then one ) .",
    "we also demonstrate using a scaled down analog of microrna stem - loop hairpin structures that , provided a sufficiently polymorphic population , recombination will lead to the evolution of mutational robustness on larger and more realistic neutral networks by concentrating the population on local regions of genotype space with high neutrality .",
    "considering the genotype space of sequences of length @xmath1 over some alphabet @xmath2 , following van nimwegen _",
    "@xcite we assume that genotype space contains a neutral network of high , but equal fitness genotypes  those sharing a common preferred phenotype .",
    "we assume , further , that the majority of the population is concentrated on this neutral network , i.e.  that the remaining part of genotype space consist of genotypes with markedly lower fitness , such that to good approximation all such phenotypes maybe considered lethal . for our evolutionary process",
    "we assume a selection - mutation - recombination dynamics with constant population size @xmath3 .",
    "we consider all mutations or recombination events leading off the neutral subset of genotypes @xmath4 with high fitness to be fatal .",
    "each individual of the population suffers mutations at a rate @xmath5 and undergoes recombination with a random member of the population at a rate @xmath6 .",
    "individuals who acquire a fatal genotype ( one not part of the the neutral network ) are replaced through reproduction of a random individual of the population .    in the limit of large populations the stationary distribution of the population on a given neutral network @xmath4 only depends on the ratio @xmath7 and the neutral network @xmath4 .",
    "considering one - point recombination crossover events and denoting the number of neutral genotypes in @xmath4 by @xmath8 and the frequency of genotype @xmath9 in the population by @xmath10 the time evolution of our system in the @xmath11 limit is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 if genotype @xmath14 can be derived from genotype @xmath15 by replacing a single letter and zero otherwise , @xmath16 equals the number of recombination ( one - point crossover ) events through which genotypes @xmath17 and @xmath18 yield genotype @xmath14 , and @xmath19 is the uniform growth rate of the population , that compensates for the disappearance of lethal genotypes generated by mutation and recombination , ensuring that the population size remains constant , i.e. @xmath20 at all times .",
    "we compute the limit distribution of the population ( @xmath21 ) by numerically computing the stationary solution of equations ( [ det_dyn ] ) .    for finite @xmath3 stochasticity resulting from the discrete nature of the reproduction process",
    "must also be taken into consideration .",
    "considering discrete generations we may proceed by solving equation ( [ det_dyn ] ) while introducing sampling noise ( i.e.  drift ) by sampling the population at unit time intervals , the mutation and recombinations rates will then be in units of events per generation . sampling consists of choosing @xmath3 individuals and assigning each a genotype @xmath14 with probability @xmath10 and subsequently updating @xmath10 accordingly and integrating equation ( [ det_dyn ] ) for one generation time before performing sampling again .",
    "the resulting stochastic population dynamics depends on the product of the mutation rate and population size @xmath22 , the ratio of the mutation and recombination rates @xmath23 , and the structure of @xmath4 .",
    "for sufficiently large sample size the stochastic dynamics of our model only depends on the combined parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "appropriately large sample size @xmath3 was chosen by increasing @xmath3 ( while keeping @xmath22 and @xmath23 fixed ) until the effects of sample size became negligible ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "computing @xmath16 requires enumerating all @xmath25 possible recombination events .",
    "this is only feasible for @xmath8 not larger then a few thousand genotypes . for larger neutral networks calculation of the infinite population limit stationary distribution",
    "is not currently tractable , it is still possible , however , to simulate the finite population dynamics as the complexity of these computations scales with @xmath26 and not @xmath27 . in these simulations we average over several runs starting form random initial conditions .",
    "we investigated the effects of recombination on two types of random neutral network ensembles . in both cases",
    "we choose an alphabet of size @xmath28 and generated random neutral networks consisting of @xmath8 genotypes of length @xmath1 .",
    "the first type of random networks ( hereafter referred to as uniform attachment networks ) were generated by choosing a random seed genotype and adding a random neighboring genotype ( one that can be obtained from it by a single mutation ) .",
    "this process was continued by selecting a random genotype from those already added to the network and adding one its neighbors not already in the network at random until the network contains @xmath8 genotypes .",
    "the second type of random networks ( hereafter referred to as preferential attachment networks ) were grown at each step by choosing genotypes from those already added to the network with a probability proportional to the number of neighbors the genotype already has in the network , and adding a neighbor not contained in the network at random until the network contained @xmath8 genotypes .",
    "this choice of random ensembles is motivated by the expected differences in the topology of networks belonging to the two ensembles .",
    "preferential networks have a topology where the most connected genotypes are also more centrally located on average .",
    "the structure of microrna precursor stem - loops , have been shown to exhibit a significantly high level of robustness in comparison with random rna sequences with similar stem - loop structures @xcite .",
    "this observation makes the neutral networks with identical stem - loop like secondary structure a natural testing ground for the evolution of mutational robustness . to construct a neutral network",
    "on which the above population dynamics is computationally tractable we proceed to construct a scaled down analog of such stem - loop structures .",
    "we downloaded all currently available mirna stem - loop precursor sequences from mirbase @xcite .",
    "analysis of the sequences and the corresponding structures indicated that hairpin like stem - loops consisted of , on average , a @xmath29-base - long loop and a @xmath30-base - pair - long stem region .",
    "to first approximation we may consider the neutral network of a hairpin like structure to consist of large quasi - independent regions corresponding to mutations in the central loop region that are connected by more rare mutations in the stem region . aiming to approximate the neutral networks of stem - loop structures by that of a single such region we used the vienna rna secondary structure prediction package @xcite to find connected neutral networks ( a set of genotypes that can be reached through single mutations ) of the hairpin like structure with @xmath31-base - pair - long stem and a @xmath32-base - long loop region . in the following we present results for the @xmath33 connected neutral network that contains the sequence gacucgcacuguc .",
    "van nimwegen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that in the limit of large populations the average number of neutral single mutant neighbors in a population in selection - mutation balance is larger then the average number of neutral neighbors in the network .",
    "the population tends to concentrate in parts of the network with enhanced neutrality . introducing recombination and numerically computing the stationary distribution of the population in selection - mutation - recombination balance using equation ( [ det_dyn ] )",
    "we observe that recombination concentrates the population even further .",
    "this observation can be quantified by comparing the entropy of the stationary population distributions @xmath21 defined by : @xmath34 for different values of @xmath23 . to asses",
    "the mutational robustness of the population we compute the average number of neutral neighbors of a random individual in the population : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number genotypes in the neutral network that can be obtained from genotype @xmath14 by replacing a single letter . to obtain a measure of the extent to which excess mutational robustness emerges solely as an effect of the population dynamics we compare this value to the average neutrality of the network : @xmath37    to compute the above averages we generated @xmath38 random neutral networks with @xmath39 and @xmath40 of both types and averaged @xmath41 and @xmath42 over them .",
    "we also generated networks with larger @xmath8 ( and @xmath1 ) values and found qualitatively similar results .",
    "we note that due to the finite nature of both the mutation rate and population size in natural populations ( together quantified by @xmath22 ) it is networks of relatively small @xmath8 that are most relevant biologically , in the sense that natural populations with finite @xmath22 are in effect restricted to some relatively small region of the neutral network for time scales long enough for local selection - mutation - recombination balance to be achieved .",
    "this implies that the extent to which robustness is evolved is determined by the local topology .",
    "the exploration of the entire neutral network occurs on a much longer time scale .",
    "this long time scale exploration is of secondary importance from the perspective of the evolution of mutational robustness as the topology of the neutral network beyond the mutational cloud is in effect invisible to the population dynamics .    as shown in fig .",
    "1.a . and fig",
    "recombination leads to a similar increase in entropy in both uniform attachment and preferential attachment random networks .",
    "the entropy increase as a function of @xmath23 is slightly less significant for preferential attachment networks @xmath43 for @xmath44 , respectively , then for uniform attachment networks , @xmath45 for @xmath44 , respectively .    if we look , however , at the increase in average mutational robustness ( fig .",
    "1.b . and fig.1.d .",
    ") we find that as a function of @xmath23 it is significantly larger for preferential attachment networks @xmath46 for @xmath44 , respectively , then for uniform attachment networks , @xmath47 for @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "this suggest that in preferential attachment networks , were the expected neutrality of genotypes with high centrality reaches higher levels , evolve higher levels of mutational robustness .",
    "similar to the case where only mutation is present the evolution of mutational robustness in the presence of recombination requires that the population be sufficiently polymorphic , i.e.  that the product of the mutation rate and the population be greater then unity .",
    "if , however , this condition is satisfied the presence of recombination leads to the evolution of increased mutational robustness under rather general circumstances . to quantify the extent to which mutational robustness increases we proceed by considering the time average over the stochastic population dynamics .",
    "due to the separation of the time scales at which the population attains local selection - mutation - recombination balance and the much longer time - scale over which it explores the entire neutral network , averaging over a set of random initial conditions was used to attain a computationally tractable approximation of the long time average .",
    "performing simulations for different values of @xmath48 shows that @xmath42 approaches its infinite population as @xmath22 is increased ( see fig.2 . ) .",
    "this indicates that recombination concentrates the population on local regions of higher neutrality for smaller @xmath22 as well . in order to examine the effects of recombination on a more realistic neutral network we also performed simulations on a scaled down version of a microrna stem - loop ( fig.3 . ) .",
    "we found that for all values of @xmath22 the extent to which the population evolves mutational robustness is higher in the presence of recombination then in its absence .",
    "we examined the effects of recombination on the extent to which populations evolving on neutral networks exhibit mutational robustness .",
    "our results show that recombination leads to enhanced mutational robustness under very general circumstances . calculating the stationary limit distribution of populations evolving on neutral networks drawn from two different random ensembles in the infinite population limit",
    "indicate that populations in which recombination is present are more sensitive to details of the topology than populations where only mutation is present . in particular , neutral networks where genotypes of high centrality exhibit larger neutrality evolve greater mutational robustness .",
    "while our results indicate that significant mutational robustness readily evolves in the presence recombination , this result must be considered with the caveat that evolution of mutational robustness through neutral dynamics requires sufficient polymorphism to be present in the population .",
