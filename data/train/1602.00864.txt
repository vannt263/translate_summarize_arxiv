    "particle physics has seen two historic discoveries in less than twenty years : the confirmation of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite and the discovery of neutrino oscillations  @xcite , both deservedly honored with the nobel prize .",
    "the unification paradigm  @xcite and the good behaviour of the electroweak breaking sector , including naturalness , perturbativity and stability  @xcite , have so far provided a strong theoretical motivation for new physics .",
    "other hints are the understanding of flavour and the unification with gravity , in addition to the challenges posed by cosmological observations associated to dark matter , dark energy and inflation .",
    "last , but not least , the need to account for non - zero neutrino mass  @xcite plays a key role in the quest for new physics  @xcite",
    ". the most popular mechanism of neutrino mass generation ascribes the smallness of neutrino mass as resulting from the exchange of heavy messenger particles , such as right - handed iso - singlet neutrinos and/or iso - triplet scalar bosons , known as the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "when formulated at low - scale this naturally implies new effects in neutrino propagation that go beyond the oscillatory behaviour , as explained below .",
    "in particular , future neutrino experiments will face the challenge of disentangling `` conventional '' cp violation with that associated to the non - unitarity of the lepton mixing matrix , which in turn results as an indirect effect of the extra neutral heavy right - handed neutrinos .    in",
    "what follows , we briefly review current neutrino oscillation parameters and describe novel effects associated to right - handed neutrino admixture in the charged current weak interaction , expected in low - scale seesaw schemes , purely in the context of the paradigm .",
    "we also recompile current limits on right - handed neutrino mass and mixing parameters .",
    "generic neutrino mass schemes require interactions associated to new yukawa couplings that do not commute with those of the charged leptons , leading to the phenomenon of mixing in the charged current weak interactions , analogous to the ckm mixing of quarks  @xcite . however , as we will see its structure can be richer .",
    "the mixing of leptons arising from the non - simultaneous diagonalizability of the dirac neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices is given by an arbitrary unitary matrix @xmath0 where each of the @xmath1 factors is effectively @xmath2 , characterized by an angle and a corresponding cp phase , e.g. @xmath3 while @xmath4 is an arbitrary diagonal unitary matrix .",
    "in complete analogy with the standard model quark sector we can use the phase redefinition freedom for neutral and charged leptons to show that only one independent cp  phase remains for the three dirac neutrinos . to find this rephasing invariant parameter we use the conjugation property  @xcite @xmath5 with @xmath6 , which allows us to identify  @xcite , @xmath7",
    "the form of the lepton mixing matrix in this case is the same as the ckm matrix describing the mixing of quarks .",
    "the case of 3@xmath83 unitary lepton mixing matrix arises , for example , if the light neutrino masses result from the exchange of iso - triplet scalar messengers through type ii seesaw  @xcite ( see below ) . within the symmetric parametrization the mixing matrix has the form @xmath9 where the diagonal unitary matrix @xmath4 is eliminated by rephasing the charged leptons but no rephasing of the neutrinos is possible , leading to two extra phases in the mixing matrix @xmath10 compared with the previous case  @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the matrix @xmath10 can be written as : @xmath11 although they do not show up in oscillations , the `` majorana '' phases will affect processes such as  @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that this fully symmetrical presentation is more convenient for the description of decay that the pdg form  @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "neutrinos from natural sources like the sun , and from the interaction of cosmic rays with the earth s atmosphere gave us the first indications for neutrino conversion .",
    "neutrinos are also produced in the laboratory , both at accelerators as well as nuclear reactors .",
    "the disappearance of muon neutrinos over a long - baseline probing the same region of squared mass splitting relevant for atmospheric neutrinos has been obtained in accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments , starting with the kek to kamioka ( k2k ) neutrino oscillation experiment , the minos experiment using the numi beam - line facility at fermilab , and currently the t2k ( tokai to kamioka ) experiment in japan and the nova experiment in the usa .",
    "these have also substantially helped in determining the neutrino parameters with a high level of precision  @xcite .",
    "the results of solar neutrino experiments have also been confirmed by reactor neutrino studies at the kamland experiment  @xcite .",
    "more sensitive experiments such as double chooz  @xcite , reno  @xcite , and daya bay  @xcite have confirmed that @xmath12 is nonzero .",
    "particularly daya bay has now provided a precision measurement of @xmath12  @xcite , one of the most important results in the field in this decade .",
    "neutrino mixing angles and squared mass differences , as determined from the global analysis in ref .",
    "the normal hierarchy case is shown with solid lines ; dashed lines are used for inverted hierarchy . ]    altogether , neutrino physics is now a mature branch of science , in which the three neutrino mixing angles as well as the two squared mass differences have been determined with high precision .",
    "the current status of the determination of the solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation parameters is summarized in fig .",
    "( [ fig : status ] ) , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the solid and dashed curves refer to the normal and inverted mass ordering .",
    "these include data from a number of solar neutrino experiments  @xcite and atmospheric data from the super - kamiokande experiment , described in ref .",
    "all of these experiments have been taken into account in the results summarized here , as well as in other similar studies , all of which agree at the @xmath13 level  @xcite .",
    "one sees that for the case of @xmath14 there is still room for improvement . concerning the standard dirac cp phase , @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) , at the moment there is only a hint that it is non - vanishing .",
    "finally , notice that oscillation experiments provide no information on the absolute neutrino mass scale , nor on the values of the majorana phases .",
    "how robust is the oscillation interpretation of current neutrino data ?",
    "so profound is the discovery of neutrino oscillations and the determination of neutrino oscillation parameters that it requires careful consideration of any possible loopholes .",
    "the good agreement between the standard solar model sound speed profile and helioseismology results substantially constrain possible astrophysical uncertainties  @xcite . yet",
    "the effect of varying solar neutrino fluxes has been widely discussed , without substantial impact on the neutrino oscillation parameters . however , although experiments are now measuring neutrino fluxes to within a few percent , helioseismic studies have reached accuracies of about a few parts in a thousand .",
    "hence , it is not inconceivable that discrepancies might eventually show up  @xcite .",
    "uncertainties associated with the possibility of solar density fluctuations were first suggested in the late nineties  @xcite .",
    "such fluctuations deep within the sun could have a resonant origin from magnetic fields in the radiative zone  @xcite .",
    "direct helioseismic tests are not necessarily in conflict with such variations , since they are not sensitive to fluctuations with size around several hundreds of kilometers to which neutrino oscillations are sensitive  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the effect on solar neutrino oscillations can be important .",
    "however , the measurement of neutrino properties at kamland provides valuable independent information which can , in fact , be used to probe the deep solar interior  @xcite .",
    "solar neutrino measurements from sno are now sufficiently precise that neutrino oscillation parameters can be inferred independently of any assumptions about fluctuation size  @xcite .",
    "in fact the fluctuation amplitudes above 5% now excluded if their correlation lengths lie in the range of several hundred km .",
    "magnetic fields in the solar convective zone can cause spin - flavour precession and produce a solar @xmath16 flux  @xcite .",
    "the robustness of the oscillation hypothesis has also been analysed in this context .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath16 production can be greatly enhanced for the case of random magnetic fields  @xcite . the search for anti - neutrinos from the sun",
    "can be used to constrain the neutrino magnetic moments  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "laboratory oscillation studies not only give a crucial confirmation of the solar neutrino oscillation hypothesis , ruling out exotic solutions , but also establish the robustness of large mixing angle oscillations  @xcite .",
    "as the only electrically neutral standard model fermions , neutrino mass generation could be different from the standard higgs mechanism .",
    "in particular neutrinos could be light as a result of their majorana nature . indeed , unless prevented by basic symmetries such as electric or colour charge  @xcite , fermions are intrinsically two - component objects .",
    "the emergence of dirac neutrinos , would then signal extra symmetry assumptions .",
    "for example one could assume lepton number conservation directly , or some extended symmetry that implies the conservation of lepton number , as some specific flavour symmetries  @xcite .",
    "moreover , following weinberg , we note the simplest operator capable of inducing neutrino masses is a unique dimension-5 operator , generally implying and majorana neutrinos .",
    "in fact mechanisms with dirac neutrino masses might be an indication for physics beyond four dimensions  @xcite .    the most popular way to induce",
    "weinberg s dimension-5 operator is through the so  called seesaw mechanism , which represents a huge variety of possible schemes .",
    "the first case is called pure type - i while the second is pure type - ii , a terminology opposite of the original one suggested in  @xcite , see fig .  [",
    "fig : seesaw ] . note that the type - i seesaw mechanism corresponds to having the neutrino mass induced from fermion exchange . in this case , as we will see , neutrino oscillations are effectively described by a non - unitary lepton mixing matrix .     in the type - i seesaw",
    "the neutrino mass is induced from the fermion exchange , while type - ii corresponds to scalar boson exchange . ]",
    "given the arbitrariness in the number and transformation properties of extra fermions ( for example , the number of right - handed neutrinos is arbitrary , since they carry no anomaly  @xcite ) the seesaw mechanism can be realized at low scale  @xcite . in this case",
    "the messenger particles may be indirectly probed through rare decay processes  @xcite and electroweak precision physics  @xcite , or be directly produced at collider experiments  @xcite .    before closing this section ,",
    "let us mention that seesaw extensions of the standard model may have deep implications for new physics , ranging from neutrino physics _",
    "stricto sensu _ to other aspects of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "in particular , the presence of new scalars required in order to break lepton number may affect the stability of the electroweak breaking  @xcite .",
    "moreover , extra scalars can also induce new contributions to `` visible '' standard model higgs decays , such as the @xmath17 and possibly account for new hints , such as the recent diphoton anomaly  @xcite .",
    "there may also be novel higgs decay channels involving the emission of the nambu - goldstone boson associated to spontaneous and neutrino mass generation  @xcite .",
    "the two - component right - handed neutrinos are singlets under the symmetry and hence can acquire potentially large gauge invariant masses , breaking total lepton number symmetry .",
    "this opens the possibility of generating light neutrino majorana masses through the exchange of heavy right - handed neutrinos , the so - called type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "this implies that , in addition to the presence of majorana phases , the lepton mixing matrix will also couple sub - dominantlly the heavy states , leading to a rectangular form for the `` pmns '' matrix  @xcite .",
    "these couplings enable the production of the right - handed neutrinos by the charged current weak interaction if the kinematics allows , possibly at the lhc .",
    "in most other cases , however , such as oscillations , the heavy states can not participate due to kinematics . as a result ,",
    "the charged current weak interactions of the light ( mass - eigenstate ) neutrinos are described by an effective non - unitary mixing matrix . + in order to find the most convenient parametrization for the matrix @xmath18 describing non - unitary neutrino propagation we start from the unitary matrix @xmath19 describing the neutrino diagonalization matrix . in the symmetric parametrization the products of the complex matrices @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w13 ] ) can be chosen in the most convenient way as @xmath21 following the notation in  @xcite we break up this matrix @xmath19 as @xmath22 where @xmath18 is a @xmath23 matrix in the light neutrino sector and @xmath24 describes the couplings of the extra @xmath25 isosinglet states , expected to be heavy .",
    "the matrix @xmath19 can be neatly expanded in perturbation theory  @xcite . with the ordering shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ueq ] ) the submatrix @xmath18 can be decomposed as @xmath26 with @xmath10 the usual unitary @xmath27 leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "the latter may be expressed as prescribed by the particle data group  @xcite or in our fully symmetric description , particularly useful for our analyses  @xcite , namely , @xmath28 note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ndescopm_c1 ] ) gives the most general and convenient description of the lepton mixing matrix relaxing the unitarity approximation , and holds in any seesaw scheme .",
    "notice that in this factorized form the left pre - factor matrix , @xmath29 , characterizes the unitarity violation .",
    "notice that the oscillations of the electron and muon neutrino flavors are described by just four extra parameters , the two real diagonal entries @xmath30 and @xmath31 plus the complex off - diagonal parameter @xmath32 which contains a single additional effective cp phase parameter .",
    "in other words only one phase combination enters the `` relevant '' neutrino oscillation experiments ( next section ) .",
    "this important property holds irrespective of the number of extra heavy leptons present .",
    "hence , by conveniently choosing the product ordering of the complex rotation matrices , we obtained a parametrization that concentrates all the information relative to the additional neutral heavy leptons in a compact and simple matrix that contains three zeroes .",
    "+ notice also that , because of the chiral nature of the model , the couplings of the @xmath33 neutrino states in the charged current weak interaction will form a rectangular matrix  @xcite , that is , @xmath34 where the first block corresponds to the three active neutrinos and the second is associated to the other states .",
    "the unitarity condition will be replaced by the relation @xmath35 with @xmath36    besides being described by a triangular matrix , another advantage of the parametrization is that the large number of mixing angles and phases coming from any number of extra heavy isosinglets can be reconstructed by relatively simple formulas .",
    "this is particularly true for the diagonal elements , @xmath37 , which are expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , the cosines of the mixing parameters are real . for the off - diagonal terms , @xmath32 and @xmath40",
    ", there is also a general and simple formula , given as the sum of @xmath25 terms @xmath41 these parameters will be complex , and the cp phase information will be encoded in the parameters @xmath42 and its conjugate @xmath43 . finally , for the @xmath44 case",
    ", we can neglect quartic terms in @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and find the expression @xmath47    in order to generate a realistic neutrino spectrum at the tree level the type - i seesaw mechanism requires two right - handed neutrinos .",
    "however in the presence of extra higgs bosons ( such as triplets present in type ii seesaw ) this is not required . for the simple case of a single extra right - handed neutrino",
    "the above expressions give @xmath48 specific expressions for various other interesting seesaw schemes with @xmath49 and @xmath50 heavy leptons are also given in ref .",
    "the couplings of the heavy right - handed neutrinos allow them to be searched for in many experiments .",
    "moreover their presence implies the effective non - unitarity of the light neutrino mixing matrix , modifying several standard model observables ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : curr - constr - right ] ) as well as oscillation probabilities which have a very simple form in vacuo as seen in sec .  [ sec : prob - non - unit ] .",
    "even though right - handed neutrinos as messengers of neutrino mass generation , as postulated in seesaw type schemes , are expected to be heavy , above the weak scale or so , they have been searched for in a variety of situations , starting from much lower masses . here",
    "we start by briefly update the constraints on right - handed neutrinos .",
    "if their mass is low enough , the right - handed states would behave as light sterile neutrinos and would show up at low energies .",

    "for the muon - type neutrino , there are also bounds from kek  @xcite ( labeled @xmath57 in the plot ) , charm ii  @xcite , fmmf  @xcite , bebc  @xcite , nutev  @xcite , e949  @xcite , and the recent constraints from the lhc experiments cms  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite .",
    "finally , we show in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ktauj ] ) the limits for the charged current coupling strength of a neutral heavy lepton with a tau neutrino .",

    "the green vertical band shows the lower part of the mass region favoured on theoretical grounds . ]",
    "one should note , however , that the limits for the mixing typically rely upon extra assumptions on the decay of the neutral heavy lepton , hence somewhat model - dependent .",
    "as will be seen below in section  [ sec : universality ] , the existence of neutral heavy leptons affects low energy weak decay processes , where the neutrinos that can be kinematically produced are only the light ones . from those searches one obtains model  independent constraints which are also shown in figs .",

    "handed neutrinos are the messengers of neutrino mass generation the corresponding mass eigenstates ( also called neutral heavy leptons ) will not be emitted in several weak decays , such as beta or muon decays , due to kinematics .",
    "therefore , such decays would measure different values for the fermi constant , violating universality .",
    "in particular , for the aforementioned beta and muon decay , the fermi constant would be modified to be @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively . since the fermi coupling constant appears basically in every weak process , almost any observable",
    "should be affected by non - unitarity , particularly the well measured ckm matrix elements .",
    "even the pion decay branching ratio @xmath60 will also be modified by universality violation : @xmath61 universality constraints derived from the ckm matrix elements  @xcite as well as from pion decay  @xcite has been extensevily analyzed and dedicated studies have been devoted to this subject  @xcite . using the above prescriptions for the fermi constants , and based on the experimental measurements for the ckm matrix elements  @xcite and for the pion branching ratio  @xcite one obtains , at @xmath62 c.l .",
    ", @xmath63 for the case of @xmath64 universality test , one can use the few experimental data available  @xcite in order to get a constraint @xmath65      more interesting is the possibility that right - handed neutrinos are the messengers of neutrino mass generation . in this case",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses may severely restrict the magnitudes of the right - handed neutrino admixtures and hence close their potential signatures at collider experiments like the lhc .",
    "this is expected in the high - scale type - i seesaw .",
    "however , these limitations can be avoided within a broad class of low - scale seesaw realizations , such as the inverse seesaw  @xcite and linear seesaw  @xcite mechanisms .    within the standard model heavy neutrinos in the tev range , would be produced only through relatively small mixing effects , since they are mainly isosinglets .",
    "still signatures associated with such heavy heavy neutrinos can searched for directly at accelerator experiments , like lep and the lhc . indeed , as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : kej ] and  [ fig : kmuj ] the restrictions from the lhc are weaker than what would be expected from unitarity violation bounds in this mass range .",
    "lhc constraints are currently absent in the case of the tau - flavor , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ktauj ] , though in principle one expects that future lhc runs will improve the situation  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the above limitation can be avoided in extended electroweak models with larger gauge groups . in such case",
    "the extra kinematically accessible gauge bosons provide a production portal for the heavy neutrinos which may be copiously produced , an can also give rise to signatures .",
    "as an example one can have left - right symmetric models , which lead to processes with lepton flavour violation at high energies  @xcite .",
    "another interesting extension are models with gauge symmetry  @xcite , which have many interesting features as well as experimental signatures .",
    "since current knowledge of the neutrino mixing matrix comes exclusively from oscillation experiments , there is no information on the absolute neutrino mass scale , neither on the majorana phases .",
    "a possible detection of neutrinoless double beta decay would imply that neutrinos are their own anti ",
    "particles  @xcite irrespective of the underlying origin of neutrino mass , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the presence of the heavy neutrinos modifies the mixing matrix entries as : @xmath67 . moreover , heavy neutrino exchange will lead short - range contributions .",
    "these will be suppressed due to their mixing in the rectangular charged current mixing matrix , and will involve a different mass dependence , since the amplitude is proportional to @xmath68 for neutrino masses above the typical neutrino momentum ( around @xmath69  gev ) , the amplitude will be inversely proportional to the mass of the heavy state .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "( [ fig : kej ] ) the limit for @xmath70 obtained from @xmath71  ge for a single massive isosinglet neutrino  @xcite .",
    "we stress that this limit holds only if neutrinos have majorana nature , a restriction that is not required for the other constraints shown on the same figure .",
    "as discussed above , the presence of extra heavy leptons modifies the standard form of the leptonic mixing matrix . for example , leptonic mixing , as well as cp violation , may take place even in the limit where neutrinos become strictly massless  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the possibility of and cp violating processes  @xcite .",
