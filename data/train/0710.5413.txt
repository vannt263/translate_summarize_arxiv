    "conventional electronics based on charge transport is facing major challenges as the scale of electronic devices will reach physical limits where purely quantum phenomena , such as electron spin , may play a dominant role .",
    "consequently , the new discipline of spintronics has emerged , focusing on processes where information is carried by the electron spin in addition to , or in place of , electron charge .",
    "the use of both charge and spin degrees of freedom is expected to enable revolutionary technologies due to ultra - high density magnetic recording , low energy consumption and short access times for reading and writing in spin - electronic devices  @xcite .",
    "an important class of representative magnetic materials which exhibit novel properties with promising applications in spintronics includes organometallic molecular magnets . in designing molecular magnets several basic requirements",
    "should be fulfilled : besides a ferromagnetic coupling of local magnetic moments necessary for coherent transport , a significant thermal stability of magnetism is requested .",
    "a cornerstone quantity which is directly related to the stability of magnetism against quantum tunneling and thermal fluctuations is the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) , the energy , necessary to change the magnetization direction relative to real space coordinates . while in molecular magnets with a small number of magnetic ions and significant distances between them the dipolar contribution to mae",
    "can be safely neglected , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which greatly increases in low - coordinated systems , is responsible for the anisotropy barrier .",
    "much experimental and theoretical effort has been devoted to understanding the spin dynamics and tunneling rates in organometallic molecular magnets  @xcite , however , surprisingly little attention has been paid so far to the first - principles calculation of their electronic and magnetic properties such as magnetic moments , spin coupling and magnetic anisotropies , which can be directly related to the measured quantities . because of the need for an atomic scale description , _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) is a driving force for spintronics , and , so far represents the most natural way towards basic understanding and the design of new spintronics materials .",
    "the flexibility and accuracy in describing elements from the whole periodic table by dft results in an enormous predictive power , especially efficient when applied to organometallic compounds , where elements with properties of a completely different physical origin are involved .    being still at a very early stage of development , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) magnetic organometallic sandwiches represent an important class of novel organic molecular magnets , which have been suggested as ideal candidates for the smallest possible high - spin magnets , allowing an extremely high density data storage .",
    "several experimental and theoretical studies have been performed on magnetic sandwiches formed by vanadium and benzene , v@xmath2bz@xmath3 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and citations therein ) .",
    "the epr measurements on vbz ( half - sandwich ) and vbz@xmath4 estimate magnetic moments of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "stern - gerlach type magnetic deflection experiments on v@xmath2bz@xmath6 complexes suggest an increase of magnetic moment with the number of v atoms in the molecule  @xcite , indicating that the magnetic moments of the v atoms couple ferromagnetically .",
    "synthesis , infrared spectroscopy  @xcite and electric dipole measurements  @xcite on mbz ( half - sandwich ) and mbz@xmath4  ( m = nb ,  ta ) compounds have also been reported .",
    "although these experiments have been carried out on molecules in the gas phase , magnetically similar and structurally stable molecules suitable for the use of deposition techniques on substrates in ultrahigh vacuum atmosphere can be synthesized .",
    "a possible example are the @xmath7-donor/@xmath8-acceptor metal complexes such as bis(@xmath9-arene ) and bis[@xmath10-(@xmath9:@xmath9-biphenyl ) ] molecules which can only be prepared by means of cocondensation techniques  @xcite . concerning theoretical investigations of the magnetism in v@xmath2bz@xmath11 clusters several applications in spintronics of these molecules",
    "have been recently suggested  @xcite .    in this paper , based on our _ ab initio _ full - potential dft calculations",
    ", we present a complete and detailed picture of the electronic and magnetic properties of the m@xmath2bz@xmath3  ( m =  v ,  nb ,  ta ) sandwiches and infinite wires  @xcite , obtained by an infinite repetition of the metal - benzene half - sandwiches .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on the values of the magnetic anisotropy energy barrier , a value of an utter importance for technological applications .",
    "while most of the v - based complexes have a strong ferromagnetic ordering of the spins , they reveal quite small values of mae .",
    "substituting vanadium ions with the heavier magnetic nb and ta ones allows to tune the spin - orbit strength with consequent values of mae two orders of magnitude larger , preserving strong ferromagnetic coupling of the spins .",
    "moreover , due to the position of the fermi level and significant spin - orbit splitting of the bands , infinite nbbz wires are suggested to exhibit the recently proposed  @xcite ballistic anisotropic magneto - resistance ( bamr ) effect , i.e.  the change of the ballistic conductance upon changing the magnetization direction , which opens the vista for new device concepts in spintronics .",
    "most of the compounds considered in this paper have a magnetization which lies in the plane of the benzenes , perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the molecules ( @xmath12 ) with negligible total energy variations as a function of spin - rotation around the @xmath12 axis .",
    "this fact will make it difficult to stabilize the magnetism in these complexes against thermal fluctuations despite the fact that the energy needed to switch the magnetization direction from in - plane to the @xmath12-direction can be rather large .",
    "however , for the v@xmath13bz@xmath14 , v@xmath14bz@xmath15 molecules and a nb - bz infinite wire , the magnetization direction points along the @xmath12-direction and the values of the uniaxial anisotropy are sizable .",
    "this suggests that a large subclass of the m@xmath2bz@xmath3 ( @xmath16 ) complexes has a magnetization which is bi - modal in nature and may be applicable , e.g. , for data storage or as qubits for quantum information , owing to the rigid fixation of the spin moments in these compounds along the single axis in space .",
    "the latter properties in combination with the small size , transparent electronic structure and large magnetic moments make this subclass valuable for potential applications in future spin - electronics .",
    "the calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga - pbe )  @xcite for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "we employed a realization of the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method for truly one - dimensional systems ( 1d - flapw )  @xcite , as implemented in the ` fleur ` code  @xcite .",
    "all the isolated molecules were calculated using unit cells repeated along the symmetry axis ( @xmath12-axis ) with a large spacing between molecules in order to exclude unwanted side effects on the electronic and magnetic structure due to interaction with the neighbors .",
    "the smallest distance between the closest atoms in two neighboring molecules was larger than 13.5  a.u .  in our calculations .",
    "the @xmath12-axis of the system cuts through the transition - metal atoms and the centers of gravity of the bz molecules .",
    "the following muffin - tin radii were chosen : 2.4  a.u .",
    "( v ,  nb ,  ta ) , 1.25  a.u .",
    "( c ) and 0.65  a.u .",
    "( h ) . in the vacuum",
    "the wave functions were expanded into cylindrical basis functions with an angular expansion up to @xmath17 .",
    "correspondingly , the charge density and potential were expanded up to @xmath18 . for calculating the isolated molecules we used one @xmath19-point and for the infinite wires we used 8 and 16 @xmath19-points in one half of the brillouin zone , respectively .",
    "the structures were relaxed with the basis functions cut - off parameter @xmath20 of 3.5  a.u.@xmath21 , and for calculations of the magnetic ground - state at the relaxed positions converged values of the spin moments and total energies were achieved with @xmath20=3.6  a.u.@xmath21 . as matter of convenience , throughout the paper we use the expression fermi energy not only to indicate the highest occupied state of an infinite metallic wire , but also to indicate the highest occupied orbital in single molecules , keeping in mind that for isolated molecules it looses the meaning of a chemical potential .    the magnetic anisotropy - induced energy barrier which needs to be overcome to change the magnetization direction from one which is lowest in energy ( easy axis ) to the energetically most unfavorable one ( hard axis )",
    "is called the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) .",
    "mae consists of the two contributions : due to classical dipole - dipole interaction of local magnetic moments and due to the spin - orbit coupling . for molecules with few magnetic centers and magnetic wires the dipolar interaction is very small , and the role of spin - orbit coupling becomes crucial , leading to huge values of orbital moments and magnetic anisotropy energy  @xcite . by including spin - orbit coupling in the total energy calculations we considered two possible symmetry - determined directions of the magnetization in the molecules : along the @xmath12-axis ( @xmath12-case ) and in radial direction parallel to the planes of the benzenes ( @xmath22-case ) , with the most energetically preferable axis being the easy axis .",
    "mae is defined as a total energy difference between these two configurations .",
    "for the molecules and wires considered in this paper , the dipolar contribution to the mae amounts to not more than a tiny value of 0.01  mev per metal atom , with the @xmath12-axis as an easy axis .",
    "therefore , we restrict our discussion in the following to the soc - part of the mae .",
    "the variation of the mae as a function of the @xmath22-axis in the plane of the benzenes normally contributes only a small fraction of the mae value and is neglected .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy energy was obtained using the force theorem with the number of @xmath19-points up to 64 , and the values of @xmath20 up to 4.0  a.u.@xmath21 , reaching convergence in the calculated values .",
    "the geometries of the considered molecules v@xmath2bz@xmath11 with @xmath23 are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "our calculations show that stable structures of the molecules are sandwiches with the metal atom above the center of gravity of bz molecules , which was also found in other theoretical and experimental investigations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and citations therein ) .",
    "the geometry of the metal - benzene molecules was restricted to @xmath24 symmetry , while all other structural parameters were relaxed .",
    "in general , spin - polarization does not change the nonmagnetic equilibrium structural values by more than 1 - 2@xmath25 .",
    "for all sandwiches the planarity of the outer bz molecules is broken with the planes of c and h hexagons parallel but slightly shifted relative to each other along the @xmath12-axis ( the value of the shift ranges between 0.02 and 0.09  a.u . , depending on the compound ) .",
    "for the v@xmath26bz@xmath0 molecule we analyzed the changes in the electronic and magnetic structure due to rotations of the benzene molecules with respect to each other around the @xmath12-axis .",
    "structural optimization of the single benzene molecule yields the values of 2.625  a.u .",
    "for the c - c bond length and 2.058  a.u .",
    "for the c - h bond length , in perfect agreement with the values obtained with various methods and reported in ref .",
    "while the changes in the c - h bond length due to the interaction with the transition - metal ( tm ) ions are negligible , the c - c distance in the benzene rings increases by at most 4.3% for the ta infinite wire . as a function of the transition metal , the c - c bond length increases from 2.3% to 4.1% for half - sandwiches and from 3.4% to 4.3% for the infinite wires , going from v to ta . concerning the distance between the metal atoms and the centers of the closest carbon rings ( m - c distance ) in v - based molecules , significant increase from the value of 3.075  a.u .",
    "for the half - sandwich up to 3.622  a.u .",
    "( 19% ) in the v@xmath0bz@xmath1 molecule is observed , revealing a strong inhomogeneity as a function of the relative position of the v atom with respect to the center of the molecule .",
    "changing the atomic number of the metal ion in the half - sandwiches and infinite wires results in the increase in the m - c distance by at most 2% , as compared to v corresponding values .    in a simple picture",
    "the mechanism responsible for bonding in the molecules can be given on the basis of a schematic analysis of the orbitals of the metal atom ( v ,  nb ,  ta ) and benzene molecule , which can be classified in terms of the pseudo - angular momenta around the symmetry @xmath12-axis .",
    "five @xmath27 orbitals of the metal atom can be divided according to their symmetries into one @xmath28 , two @xmath29 , two @xmath30 .",
    "six @xmath8-orbitals of bz form one @xmath31 , two degenerate @xmath32 ( homo ) , two degenerate @xmath33 ( lumo ) and one @xmath34 orbital . when bz molecules and metal atoms are brought together ,",
    "the homo and lumo orbitals of bz interact with the metal @xmath35 orbitals of the same symmetry and bonding occurs  @xcite ( see also figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "yasuike  @xcite explained the electronic structure of the v@xmath2bz@xmath11 complexes based on a schematic orbital interaction diagram using extended hckel or hartree - fock methods .",
    "we performed the dft electronic structure calculations for these complexes with a side goal of checking the validity and limitations of the latter computational models .    in case of spin - polarized calculations ,",
    "the calculated spin moments inside the muffin - tin spheres of carbon and hydrogen atoms constitute almost constant values of 0.01@xmath36 and 0.001@xmath36 , respectively .",
    "therefore , further on we specify only the direction of the carbon local spin moments in considered compounds .    despite a great advantage of the dft in predicting the trends in the properties of a large set of v@xmath2bz@xmath11 complexes ,",
    "we are well aware of the fact that in low - coordinated systems localized states develop , for which the common approximation to the exchange - correlation functional , the local density approximation ( lda ) or the gga , does not always provide reliable enough results . on the other hand , molecules used in context of spintronics or molecular electronics",
    "are typically attached to metallic leads .",
    "electrons in the leads contribute by screening to the reduction of the coulomb interaction in a molecule and the actual strength of the coulomb interaction in this situation remains a subject of further investigations .",
    "the self - interaction correction of a singly - occupied @xmath37 state and the coulomb interaction of localized states in molecules attached to the leads may be taken care of in the future by more reliable functionals , which came currently under scrutiny .",
    "we start with the study of the electronic and magnetic properties of the v@xmath2bz@xmath11 sandwiches , paying special attention to the origin of magnetism in these compounds and its development with increasing number of v atoms in the complexes .",
    "the issue of stability is addressed and a possibility of experimental observation of magnetism in these compounds is discussed via evaluating the values of magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the insight into the physical properties of the v - bz molecules which we provide in this section is important for understanding the trend in magnetic and electronic properties of the compounds with nb and ta ions , considered in the next section .      in order to understand the bonding and formation of a magnetic moment in the vbz molecule ,",
    "we take a look at the local densities of states ( ldos ) for the non - magnetic ( nm ) and spin - polarized ( fm ) cases at the optimized atomic positions , presented in figure  [ fig1 ] ( left panel ) . in the nm case the nonbonding @xmath37 orbital at the v site is situated at the fermi level and accommodates one electron . the interaction between the lumo orbitals of bz and the @xmath39 orbitals of the v atom results in two",
    "degenerate bonding @xmath40 states slightly lower in energy which accommodate four electrons located mostly at the v site .",
    "the overlap of the @xmath41 orbitals of the v atom and @xmath42 homo orbitals of bz produces the next low - lying @xmath8-type states of the vbz molecule carrying four electrons located mostly at the c sites of the bz ring .",
    "the interaction of the lowest @xmath43 orbital of bz with the @xmath44 orbital of vanadium results in a low lying @xmath45 state accommodating two electrons located mostly at the c sites of the bz ring .",
    "the closest to the homo orbitals , low - lying @xmath46 benzene orbital is not participating in the interaction with the metal ion .",
    "the charge density plots for the resulting states of the molecule are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , which illustrate the orbital character and bonding of the states .",
    "the magnetic solution for this compound is lower in total energy than the nonmagnetic one by a large value of 0.491  ev .",
    "the spin - polarized ldos displays a large exchange splitting of the states near the fermi level ( figure  [ fig1 ] ( left panel ) ) .",
    "this splitting is largest for the @xmath37 state of v ( located at the fermi level in the nonmagnetic dos ) . for the @xmath40 states , involved in the bonding ,",
    "the exchange splitting is much smaller . out of five electrons of v , three occupy spin up ( one at the @xmath37 level and two at",
    "the two degenerate @xmath40 levels ) and two occupy spin down ( two degenerate @xmath40 levels ) states .",
    "this results in a total spin moment of 1@xmath36 for the system .",
    "our calculations show , that this spin moment is entirely located inside the muffin - tin sphere of the v atom ( 1.09@xmath36 ) .",
    "there is no significant exchange splitting of the low bonding states of the vbz molecule .",
    "the spin moments of the c atoms couple antiferromagnetically to the spin moment of the v - atom .",
    "when two bz molecules are placed at the same distance from v , as in the vbz@xmath26 molecule , the symmetry - adapted molecular @xmath47 orbitals of the molecular complex bz@xmath26 are produced from the orbitals of two bz molecules .",
    "the atomic orbitals of v have @xmath48 symmetry and can interact only with the @xmath49 orbitals of bz@xmath26 . according to the hckel interaction scheme a nonbonding @xmath37 orbital occupies the fermi energy with one electron . as a results of hybridization between the @xmath40 orbitals of v and the @xmath50 orbitals of bz@xmath26 two degenerate @xmath40 states lower in energy are created and accommodate four electrons .",
    "the overlap between the @xmath8 orbitals of v and @xmath51 orbitals of bz@xmath26 produces two @xmath52 bonding orbitals , while @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) remain nonbonding ( for the vbz@xmath26 sandwich the @xmath52-@xmath54 splitting is barely visible due to a large distance between the v atom and benzene molecules , as compared to the compounds with larger number of vanadii , discussed below ) .",
    "the basic features of the nonmagnetic ldos ( figure  [ fig1 ] ( right panel ) with corresponding plots of the orbitals in figure  [ fig3 ] ) reflect the hckel type interaction scheme for this compound  @xcite . as in the case of the half - sandwich vbz , the @xmath37 orbital with one electron is located at the fermi level .",
    "compared to the vbz ldos , the double degenerate @xmath40 orbitals of the vbz@xmath26 molecule are situated much lower in energy .",
    "this suggests a different bonding of the @xmath39 vanadium orbitals and @xmath50 orbitals of the molecular complex bz@xmath26 .    the magnetic solution for this molecule is lower in total energy than the nonmagnetic one , with a difference in total energies @xmath55 of 0.459  ev .",
    "the spin - polarized ldos of the vbz@xmath26 molecule ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) reflects the main features of the vbz dos .",
    "the largest exchange splitting occurs for the @xmath37 state , while the exchange splitting for the @xmath40 states is significantly quenched .",
    "the low - lying @xmath56 states of the molecule are almost not exchange split .",
    "the total spin moment of the vbz@xmath26 molecule constitutes the same value of 1@xmath36 , as in the case of vbz .",
    "furthermore , the spin moments inside the muffin - tin spheres of v , c and h are almost of the same values , as in the case of the vbz molecule , with antiferromagnetic coupling of the v and c local moments .",
    "our value for the total magnetic moment agrees with the experimental average value of 0.8@xmath36 , measured by kaya and co - workers ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the vbz@xmath26 molecule at room temperature in the gas phase .      when two outer bz molecules are at the same distance from an inner bz ring as in the v@xmath26bz@xmath0 compound , symmetry - adapted molecular @xmath47 orbitals of the molecular complex bz@xmath26 are created from the orbitals of two benzenes .",
    "the atomic orbitals of the v atoms and the molecular orbitals @xmath57 of the central bz have @xmath48-symmetry .",
    "bonding molecular orbitals of v@xmath26bz@xmath0 between v atoms and bz molecules are formed due to interactions of the orbitals with the same symmetry ( e.g. @xmath48-orbitals ) .",
    "in general , the orbital interaction scheme for this complex becomes rather cumbersome .",
    "the ldos of this molecule are presented in figure  [ fig2 ] and corresponding charge density plots of the orbitals are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the notations for the orbitals follow the same scheme as for vbz and vbz@xmath26 . as a general observation ,",
    "orbitals localized at the outer bz rings ( carrying @xmath58-index ) are situated at higher energies than the corresponding orbitals of the inner bz ring ( carrying @xmath48-index ) . in the nm case nonbonding @xmath59 and @xmath60 orbitals",
    "are positioned at the fermi energy , and slightly lower in energy there are two degenerate @xmath61 orbitals arising from the hybridization between the @xmath39 s of v atoms and lumo of the outer bz s .",
    "much lower in energy are two degenerate @xmath62 orbitals reflecting strong hybridization between @xmath39 s of v atoms and lumo of the inner bz .",
    "two @xmath8-hybrids , @xmath54 and @xmath52 , are situated very deep in energy followed by a set of @xmath46- and @xmath45-type orbitals .",
    "our calculations show , that the v@xmath26bz@xmath0 molecule is magnetic , with a total energy difference between the fm and nm solutions ( to which we refer below as @xmath63 ) of 0.415  ev per metal atom .",
    "the afm solution with opposite vanadium spins is by a tiny value of 3.0  mev per v atom higher in energy than the fm solution , suggesting that the magnetic order of the molecule can be easily influenced by effects such as thermal fluctuations and vibrations , above a threshold temperature @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "the total spin moment of the molecule of 0@xmath36 ( afm ) and 2@xmath36 ( fm ) for these magnetic states should , in principal , result in an average value of 1.0@xmath36 for temperatures much larger than @xmath64 .",
    "this fact can explain an average value of 1.3@xmath36 for the complex , measured at @xmath65k by kaya and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "the spin moment value of 1.02@xmath36 inside the v muffin - tin sphere in both fm and afm configurations is close to that of the vbz half - sandwich . in the fm case",
    "the spin moments of the c atoms are parallel to each other and opposite to the v spin moments . in the afm case ,",
    "the c spin moments in the outer bz s are antiferromagnetically coupled to the closest v atom , while the c moment in the central bz vanishes .",
    "some authors  @xcite suggest that the induced carbon spin moment and its orientation with respect to the moments of vanadii could play a crucial role for the spin ordering of the latter ones . while the influence of the carbon spin moments on the magnetic ordering in the molecule is probably negligible",
    ", we performed a calculation , where we removed the central benzene from the complex , keeping the coordinates of all the other constituents constant . in this case",
    ", the total energy difference between the fm and afm solutions @xmath66 ( to which we refer below as @xmath67 ) amounts to 22  mev per metal atom in favor of ferromagnetism .",
    "thus the direct exchange between the v atoms favors ferromagnetism and the competition with antiferromagnetic super - exchange via the central benzene ring results in a small total @xmath67 value of 3.0  mev per metal atom for the v@xmath26bz@xmath0 sandwich .",
    "the fm and afm ldos ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) display large exchange splitting of the non - bonding v @xmath37 states : in both cases it reaches 2.5  ev . in the fm case the strongly bonding",
    "@xmath68 orbitals show smaller exchange splitting than the @xmath69 states , while the bonding low - energy @xmath8 , @xmath46 and @xmath45 orbitals are not exchange split at all .    in order to understand the influence of the molecules conformation on the spin coupling in this sandwich we investigated the changes in the electronic and magnetic properties with respect to the rotation of the central benzene ring ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) and @xmath12-distortion of the sandwich ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) .    in the first case we rotated only the atoms of the central benzene ring by an angle @xmath70 around the @xmath12-axis and",
    "fixed all other atom positions .",
    "the total energy @xmath71 , figure  [ fig4 ] , shows a minimum at an angle of @xmath72 for both the fm and the afm state .",
    "the significant energy gain of 50 mev suggests that the actual ground state might resemble a non - trivial angular orientation of the benzenes in the molecules ( indeed , the chirality of the complexes was reported in ref .",
    "quite surprisingly the energy difference @xmath67 between the fm and afm solution , which is one order of magnitude smaller than the total energy variation , does not display any significant changes .",
    "the same is true for the value of the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) , which is in many systems extremely sensitive to the slightest deviations in the electronic structure .    in order to model contractions and elongations of the sandwiches we fixed",
    "all in - plane coordinates while the @xmath12-coordinate of all atoms was multiplied by a factor @xmath73 ( the central benzene ring acts as a reference point ) .",
    "such contractions and elongations along the @xmath12-axis result in large deviations of the total energies for the fm and afm solution , the energy difference @xmath67 , and the values of the mae , as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the total energy has its minimum in the unstretched case ( @xmath74 ) and rises by large values of 50 mev upon contraction ( @xmath75 ) and 250 mev upon elongation ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the magnetic coupling is also strongly influenced .",
    "for an elongated sandwich ( @xmath77 ) the antiferromagnetic super - exchange between the v atoms via the central benzene ring becomes even more pronounced and the energy difference @xmath67 drops by almost half its value .",
    "accordingly , the direct exchange between the v atoms dominates for a contracted molecule ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath67 increases by 4  mev in favor of ferromagnetism .      for the triple sandwich v@xmath0bz@xmath1 we considered three possible magnetic configurations : @xmath80ferromagnetic ( fm ) , @xmath81antiferromagnetic ( afm1 ) , and @xmath82antiferromagnetic ( afm2 ) .",
    "the fm - state is by 300  mev per v atom lower in energy than the nonmagnetic solution . among the magnetic solutions , the total energy difference between the fm and afm1 configurations of 4.1  mev per v atom favors the @xmath81-state , while the afm2 @xmath82-state is by 1  mev ( per v ) higher in energy than the fm state .",
    "however , the energy barrier of 12.3  mev for the whole complex can be easily overcome due to thermal fluctuations , increasing the total spin moment of the system by occupying the excited high - spin fm state .",
    "this leads to an increase of the average value of the spin moment with increasing temperature which was indeed observed experimentally  @xcite .    in the fm case ,",
    "the spin moments of the central and outer vanadii constitute 0.76@xmath36 and 1.17@xmath36 , respectively , resulting in a total spin moment for the whole molecule of 3@xmath36 .",
    "the transfer of the spin density between v atoms indicates the delocalization of the @xmath83-electrons along the @xmath12-axis .",
    "the magnetic moments of the carbon atoms are antiparallel to the vanadium moments .",
    "for the @xmath81-configuration , the total spin moment of the system constitutes 1@xmath36 , with an absolute value of 1.07@xmath36 inside every v sphere , indicating a higher degree of electron localization on v sites .",
    "the moments of the outer carbons are opposite to the closest v spins , while the carbon moments in the two central rings of the complex vanish .",
    "the ldos for the nm , fm and afm1 solutions are presented in figure  [ fig6 ] and the charge density plots of the marked orbitals ( nm ) are given in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "due to a rather complicated structure and small energetic resolution between the states , the ldos is plotted in a smaller energy window compared to the previous complexes , and the lower homo orbitals ( e.g.  @xmath8 ) are not shown , but their charge density plots are given in figure  [ fig3 ] .    from the charge density plots for the nm state",
    "we conclude that the bonding @xmath40 and @xmath8 molecular orbitals can be distinctly separated into three groups .",
    "the first group includes @xmath84 and @xmath85 orbitals representing the bonding orbitals of separate vbz ( outside ) and vbz@xmath4 ( inside ) .",
    "the second non - bonding @xmath58-group , @xmath61 and @xmath54 , is localized on the outer vbz and inner vbz@xmath4 parts of the molecule .",
    "the third @xmath48-type group is associated with the vbz@xmath4 part of the molecule and is responsible for the bonding in the molecule . generally , the molecular orbitals associated with the central v atom are lying lower in energy than those of the outer vanadii .    for the nm case , the group of states close to the fermi level includes @xmath84 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 orbitals . for the @xmath86 ( @xmath83-type ) , mainly located on the central v atom , the transition to",
    "the chain - like @xmath12-delocalized state can be seen : the transfer of charge density from the inner v to the outer ones is clearly visible . at the same time , the @xmath87 orbital is localized exclusively on the outer v - atoms .    for the fm - case",
    "the occupied @xmath86 and @xmath87 contain contributions from all three vanadii , which is not the case for the afm1 configuration due to antiparallel spin - alignment .",
    "the fm @xmath86 exchange splitting of 1.1  ev is smaller than the corresponding value of 1.9  ev for @xmath87 level .",
    "an exchange splitting of 1.9  ev for both @xmath37-states can be observed for the afm1 configuration . concerning the @xmath40 states , the decrease in the exchange splitting",
    "can be seen when increasing the hybridization from @xmath84 to @xmath62 in the fm case , while only the afm1 @xmath61-state is exchange - split significantly .",
    "we have also considered a v@xmath1bz@xmath79 complex , obtained by adding an additional vbz molecule on top of the v@xmath0bz@xmath1 compound .",
    "the molecule is magnetic , and the ferromagnetic ( @xmath88 ) solution is by 230  mev lower in energy than the nonmagnetic one .",
    "we used the optimized ferromagnetic atomic positions to calculate the total energy differences between all possible collinear spin configurations .",
    "our calculations show that the high - spin fm solution with a total spin moment of 4@xmath36 is by 31  mev per v lower in energy , than the lowest of the low - spin states .",
    "the magnetism of v - bz complexes and its development with increasing number of vanadii is an interesting issue on its own .",
    "however , without an additional stabilizing factor this magnetism is difficult to observe experimentally , considering the scale of the energies involved , especially for smaller compounds .",
    "the technological application of the molecules is impossible without the spin moment of the molecule being coupled to the lattice , and violation of this will destroy such magnetic properties as half - metalicity or large magnetoresistance ratios  @xcite .",
    "the values of the mae for the v@xmath2bz@xmath3 compounds are presented in  table  [ table1 ] . while for the smaller compounds the mae is of the order of negligible 50  @xmath10ev per v atom , it increases by an order of magnitude for @xmath91 accompanied by a change in the magnetization direction from @xmath22 to @xmath12 for large @xmath92 .",
    "the value of 0.3  mev per v for an infinite vbz wire is close to that of 0.1  mev , reported in ref .",
    "we conclude , that magnetism in v - bz molecules of any length can be stabilized only at very low temperatures , making their technological application rather questionable without applying a strong magnetic field from outside , despite their intriguing magnetism discussed before .    one way to increase the effective anisotropy barrier in v - bz molecules could be in depositing the sandwiches on a substrate made of heavy elements , for instance , @xmath93 transition - metals .",
    "such an approach was pioneered by gambardella _ et .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite for monoatomic co chains deposited on a pt surface , where a large mae value leads to stabilizing the long - range ferromagnetic order . in this case",
    "the mechanism responsible for increase in the mae lies in a spin - polarization of the substrate atoms with a large spin - orbit interaction due to a large spin moment on the co atoms  @xcite . for a vbz molecule , the spin moment of 1  @xmath36 of the v atom",
    "is effectively shielded from interacting with the substrate by the outer benzene rings and a significant spin - polarization of the substrate atoms is unlikely .",
    "in addition , for spin - polarized transport applications  @xcite strong magnetism of the electrodes is required , which is not the case for @xmath94 and @xmath93 transition - metal ( tm ) surfaces .",
    "a different route to achieve significant anisotropy energies is to substitute the @xmath95 vanadium atoms with heavier @xmath94 or @xmath93 transition - metals .",
    "recently , it was reported , that in monoatomic chains of @xmath94 transition - metals giant values of mae can be observed  @xcite . in monoatomic chains , however , the number of the nearest neighbors for a magnetic atom is reduced to a minimal value of two , resulting in enhanced magnetism with large spin moments .",
    "this is not necessarily the case for bz - based compounds , where a strong interaction with large benzene molecules could , in principle , destroy the magnetism of the transition - metals completely . in the next section we investigate this idea .",
    "in this section we study the magnetic properties of benzene and transition - metal ( tm ) half - sandwiches and infinite wires for the @xmath94 and @xmath93 tms nb and ta , which are isoelectronic to v. this choice is based on the experimental observation of nb and ta bz - based compounds  @xcite , and the possibility to tune the spin - orbit strength in the molecules , without altering the electronic structure .",
    "we have performed nonmagnetic and spin - polarized calculations for the mbz half - sandwiches and considered for the infinite wires a ferro- and antiferromagnetic ground state .    as seen in table  [ table2 ] , all three",
    "half - sandwiches are magnetic with large magnetization energies @xmath99 , even for ta with its extended @xmath93 orbitals , and the smallest value of @xmath99 is obtained for the nbbz molecule .",
    "the main features in the electronic configuration of the molecules are preserved , going from v to ta , with one unpaired electron occupying a non - bonding @xmath37 orbital , as explained in detail for the vbz sandwich in section  [ 4.1 ] .",
    "while the total spin moment constitutes a constant value of 1  @xmath36 for all half - sandwiches ( table  [ table2 ] ) , its integrated value inside the muffin - tin sphere of the metal atom shows a significant reduction with increasing atomic number , from 1.09@xmath36 for v to 0.46@xmath36 for ta , reflecting the increasing spread from @xmath95 to @xmath93 orbitals .    concerning the local densities of states ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) , the energetic ordering of the @xmath40 and @xmath37 states , and the exchange splitting of these states near the fermi level displays a significant dependency on the metal ion .",
    "essential for applications are the states near the fermi level since they determine e.g.  the spin - dependent transport properties , and can be tuned by a particular metal atom .",
    "while the value of the @xmath40- and @xmath37-exchange splitting is quite large for v , it decreases for nb and ta  a consequence of a larger spread of the corresponding @xmath27-orbitals .",
    "the same phenomenon is responsible for the relative positioning of the @xmath37 and @xmath40 states : a larger extent of the orbitals leads to a larger overlap of the metal and benzene orbitals with a stronger bonding , pushing the @xmath40 orbitals lower in energy with increasing atomic number .    the properties of the infinite wires , which are the limiting case of a very large number of the metal atoms in the molecules , together with the information for the half - sandwiches , on the other hand , provide an insight into the magnetism of complexes with increasing length .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ table2 ] , the magnetization energies and the spin moments differ significantly between mbz@xmath100 wires and mbz half - sandwiches . while for the v wire the energy difference of 106  mev per metal ion in favor of magnetism is of the order of that for the half - sandwich , it drops by an order of magnitude for nb and ta , constituting small , but still sizable , values of 35.5 and 11.2  mev , respectively .",
    "this ensures us , that despite the large decrease in magnetization energy with increasing number of atoms in the nb@xmath89bz@xmath90 and ta@xmath89bz@xmath90 molecules , they will remain strongly magnetic even for very large @xmath92 . in the infinite wires of nb and ta the values of the total and muffin - tin spin moments",
    "are significantly reduced compared to the vbz@xmath100 wire , reflecting a more delocalized nature of the @xmath27-orbitals of these transition - metals .",
    "the ldos for the infinite wires ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) reflect characteristic broadening of the sharp states in the dos for the half - sandwiches into bands .",
    "for example , the @xmath40 states of the single molecules correspond to strongly dispersive @xmath40-bands with two - peak structure in the dos characteristic for 1d - systems  @xcite . among the two low - lying @xmath46 and @xmath8 groups of states",
    "the @xmath46-states show smaller dispersion , as they originate from states pointing in - plane , rather than along the chain axis .",
    "the @xmath37 states are also very sharp , compared to @xmath40 states , reflecting their non - bonding nature and small overlap along the @xmath12-axis .",
    "with increasing nuclear number , the exchange splitting of the @xmath40 and @xmath37 states decreases , in analogy to the single half - sandwiches , the dispersion of the @xmath40 bands increases with their left edge in the dos moving to lower energies , while the @xmath37 band moves up in energy towards @xmath101 .",
    "in contrast to finite molecules , which have a non - zero homo - lumo gap and are of insulating character , the infinite m - bz wires are essentially metallic , with a non - zero density of states at the fermi level , originating mainly from a @xmath37-band in the spin - down channel .",
    "the metallicity , more precisely , half - metallicity , of infinite v - bz wire was also theoretically predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the importance of spin - orbit coupling in half - sandwiches molecules and infinite wires with heavy @xmath94 and @xmath93 tms of nb and ta is reflected in the values of the orbital moments @xmath102 ( table  [ table2 ] ) , calculated for two different magnetization directions . for v compounds the absolute value of @xmath102 reaches 0.03@xmath36 for a half - sandwich , for the nb infinite wire it rises up to 0.07@xmath36 , and reaches as much as 0.15@xmath36 for the ta half - sandwich .",
    "the negative values of the orbital moments for most cases can be understood based on hund s rules .",
    "the values of the mae also rise significantly when going from v to ta , reaching a record value of 7.5  mev for the tabz compound , which is two orders of magnitude larger than for vbz . for the infinite wires , the values of the anisotropy energy increase for v and nb , while for tabz@xmath103 the value of the mae drops compared to the tabz molecule , but the value of 3.2  mev is still large .",
    "the easy axis of magnetization , with an exception of nbbz@xmath103 , lies in the plane of the benzenes for all the cases ( @xmath22-case ) , and in general , follows the rule that the direction of magnetization is that of the largest orbital moment , justified for @xmath95  @xcite and partly also applicable to @xmath94 transition - metals  @xcite .",
    "we conclude , that substituting the vanadium ions in mbz compounds by heavier nb and ta ions , which can be synthesized experimentally  @xcite , preserves the large magnetisation in these compounds with a pronounced tendency towards ferromagnetic arrangement of the spins .",
    "in addition , it would allow to achieve much higher values of the magnetic anisotropy energy , making it possible to use these molecules for technological applications .",
    "another interesting effect of the spin - orbit coupling can be seen for the nbbz@xmath103 infinite wire , and can be related directly to the recently proposed transport phenomenon of the ballistic anisotropic magnetoresistance ( bamr )  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to bulk materials , the mechanism of electronic transport changes drastically when going to the nanoscale . when the dimensions of the sample are smaller than the mean free path of the electrons , the transport is ballistic , rather than diffusive , and the conductance shows a step - like behavior with the applied voltage in units of @xmath104 for magnetic systems  @xcite .",
    "in recent experiments performed on ni ballistic nanocontacts  @xcite , a change of sign was found in the magnetoresistance obtained for the field parallel and perpendicular to the current .",
    "the bamr has recently been experimentally demonstrated for co nanocontacts in accordance to simple co monowire band structure calculations  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this magnetoresistance anisotropy in the ballistic regime stems from the fact that the conductance , e.g. , in a perfect nanowire , depends on the number of bands @xmath105 crossing the fermi energy @xmath101 : @xmath106 .",
    "the crucial point behind the bamr effect is that the number of bands at @xmath101 can depend on the magnetization direction via the spin - orbit interaction , which couples the orbital and spin moment , causing the projection of the latter to be different depending on the direction of magnetization .",
    "it is important to realize , however , that the large desired values of the anisotropic magnetoresistance are a consequence not only of the electronic structure at the fermi energy , but also of a large spin - orbit splitting of the bands . for a nbbz infinite wire , e.g. , a lucky combination of both occurs ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "significant spin - orbit splitting of the bands at the fermi energy leads to a different number of states crossing the fermi level for the two magnetization directions .",
    "in particular , the edge of the @xmath40-band at the @xmath107-point of the brillouin zone for the spin - up channel occurs exactly at the fermi energy @xmath101 , and undergoes a spin - orbit induced splitting when the direction of magnetization is along the @xmath12-axis , so that one of the so - split bands with the negative orbital character  @xcite gets completely occupied and moves to lower energies .",
    "this is not the case for a magnetization pointing in the plane of the benzenes , when no spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath40-bands can be seen , with two of the degenerate @xmath40-bands crossing the fermi energy .",
    "this allows to manipulate the conductance in the system by an external magnetic field  an example of ballistic anisotropic magnetoresistance  which opens a road for many possible spin - dependent transport applications . in realistic systems , such as molecules sandwiched between two electrodes , which rarely serve as ideal electron injectors",
    ", the conductance of the whole system can not be given anymore by simple counting of the bands at the fermi energy .",
    "the transport properties of the system will depend crucially on the coupling to the leads as well as on subtle details of the contact geometry .",
    "however , as follows from our calculations , for long nb - bz molecules and wires the importance of spin - orbit coupling for states around the fermi energy could result in significant modulations of the overall conductance as a function of the direction of the applied magnetic field , irrespective of the specific contact geometry - an effect , which could be observed experimentally .",
    "in our extended first - principles study we shed light on the electronic and magnetic properties of metal - benzene sandwiches and infinite wires of v , nb and ta .",
    "we found that all the v@xmath2bz@xmath3 ( @xmath108 ) molecules and the infinite wire vbz@xmath103 are magnetic with a large gain in total energy compared to the nonmagnetic solution .",
    "the magnetic ground state of all the molecules is ferromagnetic with an exception of the v@xmath0bz@xmath1 compound .",
    "the competition of the super - exchange mechanism between the metal atoms via the benzene molecules with the direct exchange between the metal ions results in small energy differences between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic solutions for small @xmath92 .",
    "the rigidity of the magnetism was investigated with respect to the vibrations in the v@xmath26bz@xmath0 compound . with increasing number of vanadii in the complexes",
    "the ferromagnetism becomes energetically more favorable , resulting in a monotonous increase of the total spin moment as a function of @xmath92 , as observed experimentally .",
    "the values of the spin moments and their qualitative behavior as a function of the temperature is in good accordance with experiments as well .",
    "we analyzed the stability of magnetism in v - based compounds by evaluating a crucial quantity , the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) , which fixes the direction of the magnetization with respect to the lattice , making the technological application of the sandwiches possible .",
    "we find that for the molecules with @xmath109 the values of mae are of the order of tiny 50  @xmath10ev per metal atom , and rise with the number of vanadii up to 0.3  mev in the infinite wire .",
    "we show that in order to increase the effective anisotropy barriers in the sandwiches it is desirable to use heavy nb and ta metal ions isoelectronic to v. going from a single half sandwich to the infinite wires the ferromagnetism in nb - bz and ta - bz compounds is preserved , while the values of mae increase by one to two orders of magnitude .",
    "moreover , strong spin - orbit coupling in these molecules can result in intriguing physical effects with major consequences for spin - polarized transport and spintronics applications . as an example",
