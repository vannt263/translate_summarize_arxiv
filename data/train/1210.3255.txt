    "differential forms and sheaves of differentials are fundamental objects and indispensable tools in the study of smooth varieties and complex manifolds .",

    "since the @xmath8-module structure    is comparatively simple , reflexive differentials are often quite    useful in practise .",
    "reflexive differentials arise naturally in a    number of contexts , for instance in positivity results for    differentials on moduli spaces .",
    "note that the dualising sheaf is    always a sheaf of reflexive differentials ,    @xmath12}_x$ ] .",
    "reflexive differential forms do not generally satisfy the same universal properties as khler differentials .",
