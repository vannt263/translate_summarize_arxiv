    "although the idea of inflation @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) started from solving the problems ( like horizon and flatness problem ) of the old hot big bang model , the key to distinguish different inflation models lies on primordial curvature perturbation @xmath2 which provides the seeds for structure formation .",
    "inflation could more or less generate some primordial curvature perturbation since we are living in a quantum world .",
    "the primordial curvature perturbation generated from simple ( single - field slow - roll ) inflation models is adiabatic , almost scale invariant , and gaussian .",
    "however , if inflaton is responsible for generating primordial curvature perturbation , the constraint of cmb normalization ( i.e. @xmath3 ) is so strong that we usually need to fine - tune the parameter(s ) when building an inflation model .",
    "furthermore , future experiments ( like planck satellite ) may detect large non - gaussianity and hence rule out simple scenarios of inflation .",
    "this will reveal for us a nontrivial way of generating primordial curvature perturbation and one of the promising ideas to generate large non - gaussianity is through a curvaton @xcite .",
    "non - gaussianity generated from curvaton scenario can be described by the nonlinear parameter @xmath1 , which takes the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the gaussian part of @xmath2 .",
    "currently the upper bound of @xmath1 is roughly given by ( @xmath6 ) @xcite @xmath7 in the near future , the planck satellite will reduce the bound to @xmath8 if non - gaussainity is not detected .",
    "curvaton is supposed to be light and subdominant during inflation .",
    "because it is light , it can produce sizable quantum fluctuations which when stretched outside the horizon during inflation would become classical perturbations . because it is subdominat ,",
    "the perturbations should be regarded as isocurvature perturbation after inflation when the curvaton field starts to oscillate .",
    "the curvaton is supposed to decay after inflaton decay and at the same time transform its isocurvature perturbation to curvature perturbation .",
    "if the curvature perturbation of the universe is from the curvaton , it could liberate the constraint on inflation and lower the scale of inflation @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting if we can identify a field from particle physics to be the curvaton and one of the candidate is a right - handed ( rh ) sneutrino in the framework of supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "the idea of a right - handed sneutrino curvaton has already be mentioned in the original paper of curvaton @xcite and been considered in @xcite . in this case , however , it is possible that we have more than one generation of the right - handed sneutrino and more than one curvaton .",
    "the calculation for two curvaton decay has been considered in @xcite , however , the parameters used in the paper is not of direct use for particle physicists to find possible candidate for the curvatons . in this paper",
    "we consider the decay width of the right - handed sneutrino curvaton in terms of the yukawa couplings and masses .",
    "it turns out that there are six parameters in addition to the hubble parameter .",
    "we then numerically scanning the parameter space in order to find solutions .",
    "this paper is organized as followsing . in section [ sec1 ] , we review the result of @xcite in order to compare single- and two- curvaton decays in the succeeding sections . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we present the formalism we use for calculating two curvaton decay . in section [ sec3 ] , we specify the parameter space and present our numerical results",
    ". section [ sec4 ] is our conclusion . for completeness , there is also an appendix section in the end of the paper where we summarize the equations adopted from @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in standard model of particle physics , there is no good candidate to play the role of a curvaton .",
    "however , if we go beyond the standard model by imposing susy , there are lots of scalar fields . in this section",
    "we review the idea of a right - handed sneutrino which plays the role of the curvaton .",
    "we focus on the case that when the curvaton decays , it subdominates the energy density of the universe @xcite , because large non - gaussianity could be produced in this region of the parameters .",
    "the superpotential of the rh neutrino is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the rh neutrino superfield , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mssm higgs and lepton doublet superfields , and @xmath13 is the rh neutrino mass .",
    "the canonical type - i seesaw mechanism gives the mass relation between light and heavy majorana neutrino masses as @xmath14 with @xmath15 denoting the vacuum expectation value of @xmath16 .",
    "the mass squared differences revealed from the neutrino oscillation data , @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite , indicates that if we consider three generations of rh sneutrinos , the lightest left - handed neutrino mass can be very small while the mass of the other two generations are fixed due to the oscillation data .",
    "this means in principle we can have a yukawa coupling arbitrarily small ( @xmath19 ) but the other two yukawa couplings should result in the neutrino masses around @xmath20 ( with a mass difference @xmath21 , namely , `` inverted ordering '' ) . on the other hand",
    ", we can also have `` normal ording '' which implies @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . from eq .",
    "( [ yukawac ] ) we can see that for the case @xmath25 , if we have @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , we need @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the potential of the rh sneutrino @xmath30 can be expressed as @xmath31 for simplicity , here we do not consider the hubble - induced mass term .",
    "it is possible that the mechanism which suppresses the hubble - induced mass term for the inflaton also suppresses that for the curvaton .",
    "for example , this is the case for d - term hybrid inflation @xcite .",
    "the decay rate for the rh sneutrino is @xmath32 the spectrum is given by @xmath33    if we assume that at the time @xmath34 of curvaton oscillation with energy density @xmath35 , the universe is dominated by radiation ( the decay products of inflaton ) with energy density @xmath36 . at the time of curvaton decay @xmath37 , the energy density of the universe",
    "is given by @xmath38 .",
    "therefore @xmath39 and @xmath40 is given by    @xmath41    throughout this paper , we always use a subscript  @xmath42 \" to denote horizon exit .",
    "when @xmath43 is small , the nonlinear parameter is given by @xmath44 note that here @xmath1 can never be negative because we assume the curvaton is subdominant when it decays .",
    "as we will see in the following section , this is not true in the two - curvaton case . by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) , and ( [ eq3 ] ) , we can obtain @xmath45 and @xmath46 it is interesting to note that here the spectrum does not give constriant on the mass of the right - handed sneutrino . however , as we can see in the next section , the results",
    "does depend on the masses when we consider the two curvatons case .",
    "in our setup , we consider three generations of right - handed sneutrinos for type - i seesaw model and for simplicity we assume the heavist right - handed sneutrino ( with a mass we denoted as @xmath47 ) does not play any role in cosmology , namely @xmath48 . ) .",
    "the effect is most significant for the heavist right - handed snetrino due to the largest yukawa coupling .",
    "even if @xmath49 , it is possible that the heavist right - handed sneutrino obtains an effective mass larger than the hubble scale during inflation while other right - handed sneutrinos have masses lighter than the hubble scale . ] here we consider the case that the lighter two right - handed sneutrinos are curvatons ( we call them curvaton @xmath50 and curvaton @xmath51 ) and investigate the effects on the primordial curvature perturbation",
    ".    the decay rates of the two curvatons are @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the yukawa couplings and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are their masses . quite generally , we consider @xmath57 we assume that when both of the curvaton decays , the energy density of the universe is dominated by radiation so that we can compare this with single curvaton case . the similar calculation of the energy density ratio @xmath58 as in eq .",

    "we tackle the problem numerically by scanning the parameter space .",
    "first of all , we assume the inflaton contribution to the curvature perturbation is small , this implies @xmath82 where @xmath83 . for a typical value of @xmath84 at horizon exit , we have the bound for hubble parameter @xmath85 we will numerically find solutions by making plots for the two cases @xmath86 and @xmath87 in this paper .",
    "the range of the curvaton field values at hubble exit are chosen to be @xmath88 the lower bound is from the requirement that the classical field value is larger than its fluctuation and the upper bound is from the requirement that the curvaton would not drive a second stage of inflation .",

    "this is interesting because it is consistent with the neutrino oscillation data which we discussed below eq .",

    "we would like to emphasis here that our goal is not showing that all of our parameter spaces are compatible with neutrino oscillation data , because our results can generically apply to other two - curvaton models with a similar decay rates .",
