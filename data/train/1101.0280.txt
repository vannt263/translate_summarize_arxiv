    "the hot phase ( @xmath0 k ) of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is generated primarily by the mechanical power imparted by stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae ( sne ) .",

    "theoretical work by @xcite demonstrated that superbubbles could be considered more powerful versions of stellar wind - blown bubbles , which already had a well - developed theoretical model @xcite .",

    "the influence of superbubbles can extend beyond the thin gaseous disk , as some superbubbles vent their hot , metal - enriched plasma into the galactic halo , creating galactic fountains @xcite in normal spiral galaxies like the milky way and feeding galactic superwinds in starburst galaxies @xcite .    as the hot , collisionally ionized plasma in superbubbles emits primarily by x - ray line emission and thermal bremsstrahlung",
    ", x - ray observations provide a crucial window on these energetic phenomena .",
    "however both x - ray and optical observational studies indicate that our current understanding of superbubble physics and energetics is incomplete .    the earliest imaging x - ray observations of star - forming complexes in the magellanic clouds with the _ einstein observatory _ revealed that some superbubbles were indeed detected as x - ray sources @xcite . surprisingly , the detected superbubbles typically had x - ray luminosities an order of magnitude greater than predicted from the standard weaver et al . model ( we refer to these as x - ray - bright superbubbles ) .",
    "these x - ray - bright superbubbles demonstrate that the processes responsible for x - ray emission in superbubbles are not yet fully understood .",
    "not all superbubbles are over - luminous , however .",
    "other superbubbles in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) are as faint or fainter than expected based on the weaver et al .",

    "solutions to the x - ray - bright superbubble problem fall into two categories ; ( 1 ) replacing the standard weaver et al .",
    "model at some or all epochs of superbubble growth , and ( 2 ) supplementing and extending the standard weaver et al . model",
    ".    a popular and elegant example of the first approach was pioneered by @xcite , who proposed that the impact of the blast waves from any sne that occurred near the superbubble shell can shock - heat the shell to x - ray - emitting temperatures . using 1-d models employing the kompaneets thin shell approximation @xcite they demonstrated that this shock - heating leads to a large , but _ temporary _ , increase in the total x - ray luminosity from the superbubble .",
    "evidence exists for supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks within superbubbles , and snr shell impacts are also the most plausible cause of the unusually high shell expansion velocities seen in some superbubbles @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , their precise contribution to the x - ray luminosity is uncertain .",
    "the most - promising example of a solution of the second kind is that of @xcite . the standard weaver et al .",
    "wind - blown bubble model takes no account of metal enrichment once sne occur ; the metal abundances in the hot plasma are assumed to be the same value at all times . for a collisionally ionized plasma in the temperature range @xmath1",
    " @xmath2 k the x - ray emissivity is roughly proportional to the metal abundance of the plasma , as line and recombination dominate over pure thermal bremsstrahlung . @xcite point out that if the plasma is enriched in abundance by a factor of 10 or more by sn activity , then a similar enhancement in the soft x - ray luminosity should be expected . in this hypothesis",
    "the structure of the hot x - ray - emitting superbubble interior remains that given by the weaver et al .",
    "model at all times , but its chemical enrichment must be taken into account self - consistently .",
    "this hypothesis remains to be tested  as yet there is no observational evidence for high metal enrichment in x - ray - bright superbubbles .    constraining the extent to which these , or any other , mechanisms contribute to the total x - ray emission of superbubbles requires higher quality x - ray data than was available with the earlier generations of x - ray observatories ( _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ , and _ asca _ ) .",
    "potential discriminants between the different models hinge on spatial variations in the x - ray spectral properties of the plasma within superbubbles , which requires observations with an instrument combining high spatial resolution , moderate to high spectral resolution and high sensitivity .",
    "both modern x - ray observatories , the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and the _ xmm - newton _ , fulfill these requirements .",

    "these blank - sky data sets comprise hundreds of kiloseconds of data per ccd chip , providing a high s / n estimate of the typical background experienced by the acis detectors . since the net background experienced in the acis detector does change with time , the blank sky data was re - normalized so that the mean x - ray surface brightness ( excluding point sources ) for each chip in the @xmath23 ",

    "the hydrodynamic model suggests , however , that mass - loading via thermal evaporation from the shell walls must play a role in these bubbles .",

    "we use equations 9 and 10 from @xcite to calculate the resulting metallicity :    @xmath319    @xmath320    @xmath321 is the mass ejected in sne , @xmath322 is the mass evaporated from the shell walls , and @xmath323 and @xmath324 are the solar abundances by mass from @xcite , @xmath325 and @xmath326 .",
    "@xcite predict that the evaporated mass will be the dominant source of mass in the bubble interior .",
    "we assume that , apart from the mass ejected by the four sne , the remainder of the mass was contributed by evaporation .",
    "assuming stellar remnant masses of @xmath327  @xcite and the initial masses from @xcite , the total mass returned to the ism by the four most massive stars is 257 , resulting in a @xmath322 of @xmath283  2700 .",

    ", the factor of 10 increase from @xmath330 of 0.4  to @xmath331 of 3  would be sufficient to explain the factor of 10 increase in dem l152 s luminosity ( see table  [ tab : models ] . )",
    "this predicted metallicity does not match the observed @xmath3 abundance in dem l152 , however ( see table  [ tab : fit152 ] ) , which is subsolar in all cases with reasonable error bars .",
    "the @xmath3/fe ratio is a more reliable diagnostic of the metallicity , and it is possible that the @xmath3 abundance from the spectral fits is incorrect . given the additional uncertainties in the bubble s density , geometry , and resulting mass and in the number of sne that have occurred , this discrepancy between the predicted and observed metallicities is not unexpected .",
    "the predicted @xmath3/fe ratio from the 4 sne is 5 - 8 , while table  [ tab : fit152 ] shows typical @xmath3/fe ratios of around 3 .",
    "when errors are taken into account , the observed @xmath3/fe ratio could be consistent with the predicted value , and therefore it is possible that the higher @xmath3 abundance is also present .",
    "if we use the observed @xmath3 abundances , which have an average value of @xmath332  and are generally consistent with 1 , the enhancement over the weaver model only accounts for 14 - 20% of the observed emission . at most ,",
    "the observed @xmath3 abundance can account for the diffuse emission in the bubble and west regions and the west blowout , but not for the emission from the bubble limb , west limb , or south bar .",
    "if , on the other hand , we accept that this observed @xmath3 abundance is inaccurate and use the predicted @xmath331 , the enhanced metallicity explains the x - ray luminosity but not the limb - brightened features or enhanced expansion velocities .",

    "the predicted metallicities are much higher than the approximately solar values obtained from the non - equilibrium fit , and as with dem l152 , the observed metallicities can not account for the majority of the x - ray enhancement .",
    "another possible explanation for the high x - ray luminosities of dem l50 and dem l152 is mass loading from the evaporation or ablation of overrun clouds .",
    "while the distribution of mass from evaporation at the shell walls should be uniform over relatively large scales , evaporating clouds should appear as small clumps of emission in our data .",
    "dem l50 is located in a void and does not exhibit any noticeable clumpiness in its emission .",
    "the two knots we observed in dem l152 and its more crowded hi environment , on the other hand , show that mass - loading by clumps could be occurring in that bubble .",

    "to encompass this range of possible cloud parameters , we calculated the emission from clouds with each of these three densities ( @xmath337=0.4 , 4 , and 10 ) , a temperature of @xmath338 k , a metallicity of 0.4 , and radii of 0.5 pc , 1 pc , and 5 pc , all of which should be resolved at chandra s @xmath339 \" resolution .",

    "a comparison with the x - ray contours in figures  [ fig : img_deml50 ] and  [ fig : img_deml152 ] shows that the knots with radii of 0.5 pc are potentially detectable if they have a density of @xmath342 , while no knots with a density of @xmath343are detectable .",

    "these values suggest that these knots may indeed be genuine clouds swept up by the bubble .",
    "another possibility is that some clumps appeared as point sources in the images ( fig .",

    "the soft point source in dem l152 is located outside the main bubble .",
    "this source is likely associated with the highly ionized n44 c region rather than an independent cloud swept up by dem l152 . in any case",

    "a limb - brightened morphology , on the other hand , appears correlated with supernova activity .",
    "no pre - supernova superbubbles yet studied show limb - brightening , while this morphology is common in post - supernova superbubbles @xcite .",
    "dem l50 and dem l152 s limb - brightened morphologies likely reflect their supernova history rather than a history of high mass - loading .",
    "mass - loading should reduce the central temperature of a bubble ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    "the temperature derived from the non - equilibrium fit to dem l50 is completely consistent with the weaver model predictions , however , requiring no additional mass - loading .",
    "mass - loading by overrun clouds or evaporation from the shell walls is likely occurring to some extent in both bubbles , but it does not fully explain the bubbles x - ray emission or large - scale properties .",
    "dense cloudlets have been detected in other superbubbles , but their presence does not necessarily imply a high x - ray luminosity .",
    "for instance , although clouds are detected in the superbubble dem l192 and the bubble appears to be expanding into an inhomogeneous ism , its x - ray luminosity in the 0.3 - 3.0 kev band is only moderate , @xmath358 @xcite .",
    "@xcite note a correlation between the h@xmath3  and x - ray surface brightnesses in this bubble , however , and suggest that mass - loading is occurring through evaporation at the shell walls .",
    "this analysis is consistent with our findings in this section and in   [ sec : models : hd ] ; thermal conduction and the subsequent evaporation of shell material is important in dem l50 and dem l152 , while the contribution of swept - up clouds to the x - ray emission is negligible .",
    "thus , we see evidence that both metallicity enhancement and mass - loading by clouds has taken place in these superbubbles .",
    "the metallicity enrichment is too low to account for the observed luminosities , however .",
    "likewise , few candidate clouds are observed in the superbubbles and the x - ray emission is inconsistent with a high mass - loading scenario .",
    "metallicity and mass - loading by clouds do not completely explain the observed x - ray luminosities .",
    "we present high spatial resolution _ chandra _",
    "acis - s images and spectra of the diffuse emission in two x - ray - bright lmc superbubbles , dem l50 and dem l152 .",
    "these objects have x - ray luminosities on the order of @xmath299 , an order of magnitude higher than predicted by the standard @xcite wind - blown bubble model .",
    "the level of detail in the _ chandra _ observations allows us to evaluate the relative importance of the various mechanisms that contribute to the x - ray luminosity by constraining the spatial origin of the emission and revealing x - ray spectral variations across the superbubbles .    with these high - quality images , we isolated the diffuse x - ray emission by excluding point sources and examined the spectra of separate regions within each superbubble .",
    "x - ray images of both bubbles show limb - brightened morphologies . most of the limb - brightening in dem l50 is the result of a higher central absorption column density , while the limb - brightening at the bubble s southern end may be real . likewise",
    ", the intervening absorption does not account for the limb - brightening in shell 1 of dem l152 .",
    "hardness ratios indicate that these same regions , the bright limb subregion of dem l50 and shell 1 of dem l152 , are spectrally harder than the other regions in the superbubbles .",
    "spectral fits to the superbubbles account for the variations in absorption column density from region to region and reveal the temperature differences and luminosity contribution of each region .",
    "the spectra of both objects show evidence of snr impacts on the shell walls .",
    "in particular , dem l50 s bright limb has a harder spectrum , higher temperature , and higher surface brightness than the rest of the bubble .",
    "these spectral properties support the idea that a snr recently heated the limb region .",
    "the limb - brightened shell 1 region in dem l152 also has a higher temperature and surface brightness compared to other regions of the superbubble .",
    "a high temperature component in the limb - brightened west region and the adjacent south bar blowout may be another indicator of recent heating due to sne .",
    "our spectral fits also revealed unexpected abundance ratios in dem l50 , which suggest the superbubble is not in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "dem l50 s low @xmath3/fe ratio is the opposite of the expected @xmath3-enrichment from core - collapse sne .",
    "while we can not rule out the possibility of a type ia sn in the area , the consistency of the ratio across the bubble suggests that either the bubble happens to lie in an unusual ism environment or , more likely , dem l50 is not in ionization equilibrium . assuming a non - equilibrium situation , the derived ionization timescales are on the order of 10@xmath359 years , which is consistent with the other indications of a recent supernova in the bubble .",
    "we compared our observations with both the standard wind - blown bubble model @xcite and a one - dimensional hydrodynamic model based on @xcite .",
    "both models include the time - dependent energy input of the stellar population . as shown by the weaver model",
    "predicts a total x - ray luminosity an order of magnitude below the observed value . while the 1-d hydrodynamic simulation reproduces the size and expansion velocity of dem l50 by assuming a higher ambient pressure and including the effects of snr impacts , the neglect of thermal conduction produces x - ray luminosities far below our observed luminosities .",
    "this discrepancy indicates that thermal conduction is important in these bubbles , as evaporation of material from the shell walls enhances the density of the interior .",
    "the snr impact does significantly brighten the modeled bubble , particularly at the limb , which supports the off - center snr explanation for the existence of x - ray - bright superbubbles @xcite .",
    "our observations do not reveal signs of significant metal enrichment , an alternative explanation for the high observed luminosities @xcite .",
    "a higher proportion of metals could enhance the x - ray emissivity , but neither superbubble exhibits a sufficiently high metallicity to account for the anomalous x - ray luminosity .",
    "abundances determined from x - ray observations are uncertain , however , and the bubbles may be more enriched than the spectral fits suggest . while a high metallicity could raise the luminosity , it would still not explain the observed morphologies or large expansion velocities of the objects .",
    "we consider the hypothesis that mass - loading through the ablation or evaporation of swept - up clouds could increase the density of the superbubbles and raise the x - ray luminosity ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with _ chandra _",
    "s @xmath283  1 \" resolution , we expect to detect clouds a few parsecs in diameter .",
    "few candidate clouds are observed , and they contribute negligible emission to the superbubbles .",
    "although some mass - loading is likely present and the superbubbles may have overrun more clouds in the past , the effect of clouds on the x - ray emission is insignificant compared to the luminosity enhancement from snr impacts .",
    "an examination of the energy budget for both superbubbles further clarifies the role of off - center snrs .",
    "the relatively small bright limb subregion of dem l50 generates roughly a quarter of the total luminosity , while the limb as a whole accounts for half of the total x - ray luminosity . in dem l152 ,",
    "the shell 1 limb and west limb regions alone provide about half of the total x - ray luminosity .",
    "all these regions exhibit signs of supernova activity . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution of metallicity enrichment and mass - loading from clouds to the x - ray luminosity is much less .",
    "metallicity enrichment accounts for at most 20% of the excess emission , while dense clouds account for less than 2% of the total emission .",
    "snr impacts and evaporation of material from the shell walls dominate the observed x - ray luminosities .",
    "our _ chandra _ images and spectra of dem l50 and dem l152 are the first observations of x - ray - bright superbubbles at a sufficiently high spatial and spectral resolution to distinguish between various emission mechanisms .",
    "while mass - loading and metallicity enrichment due to sne must be occurring to some degree , our observations confirm that thermal evaporation from the shell walls and off - center snr impacts are the primary sources of the enhanced x - ray luminosity .",
    "snr impacts increase the shell expansion velocity , lead to higher radiative losses , and may contribute to blowouts and the subsequent mixing of ism and hot , enriched gas .",
    "although the x - ray luminosities are not high enough to explain the superbubble growth - rate discrepancy , x - ray radiative losses will decrease the energy available for transport to the ism . unlike the cloud mass - loading scenario",
