    "current theories and observations suggest that low - mass stars form by gravitational collapse and subsequent accretion through a circumstellar disk , with the accretion energy driving a collimated outflow perpendicular to the plane of the disk .",

    "probably due to their short lifetimes , the necessity of achieving high angular resolution ( not available in the observations prior to alma ) and source confusion in dense clusters . therefore , the study and characterization of the outflow and infall processes involved in the formation of high - mass stars need to be understood in more detail .",
    "since high - mass stars form in dense cores , dense gas tracers such as hcn are useful in identifying outflow and infall motions ( e.  g. , liu et al .  2011a , 2011b , 2013 , 2015",

    "the single pointing cso observations of w3(oh ) by wu & evans ( 2003 ) show that the hcn(32 ) line has a double peak , with the blue - shifted peak being stronger than the red - shifted one ( hereafter ` blue profile ' ) , while the h@xmath18cn(32 ) line peaks at the absorption dip of the hcn(32 ) , which was used by the authors to identify w3(oh ) as a collapsing candidate object .",
    "however , their low - spatial resolution observations can not determine the center of collapse .",
    "our cso observations of the hcn(32 ) line , covering an area of 110@xmath14 , are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the ` blue - profile ' is not only seen towards the central position but towards a large area , suggesting that the w3(oh ) complex is overall undergoing collapse , similar to what is observed in the g10.6@xmath190.4 star forming region ( liu et al .",

    "the combined sma and cso data ( sma+cso , red contours ) are overlaid .",
    "the structure of the emission is the same in the sma and sma+cso datasets in the velocity ranges from @xmath1969 to @xmath1953  km  s@xmath5 and from @xmath1942 to @xmath1929  km  s@xmath5 . around the systemic velocity of the cloud ( i.  e. , from @xmath1952 to @xmath1943  km  s@xmath5 ) , the distribution of the gas consists of compact and diffuse components .",
    "as expected , the sma data pick up the compact component well , while the diffuse gas is only detected with the cso single - dish observations .",
    "a velocity gradient is seen in the channel maps , with a blue - shifted ( from @xmath1969 to @xmath1956  km  s@xmath5 ) component to the north - east of the w3(h@xmath1o ) , and a red - shifted component ( from @xmath1940 to @xmath1932  km  s@xmath5 ) to the south - west . at around @xmath1947 to @xmath1946  km  s@xmath5 , we identify a flattened structure , without diffuse emission , elongated in the southeast - northwest direction .",
    "this velocity range is close to the self - absorption peak ( see section  3.2.2 and figure  3 ) for the hcn(32 ) line , suggesting that it traces a high - obscured part of the core , therefore likely locates at the center of the dense core .",
    "this structure is perpendicular to the high velocity blue and red - shifted gas , which might indicate the presence of a disk ( or toroid ) and outflow system . in general ,",
    "the gas is mainly associated with w3(h@xmath1o ) , suggesting that hcn high velocity gas is most likely related to the presence of w3(h@xmath1o ) rather than w3(oh ) .",
    "in addition to the high velocity gas associated with w3(h@xmath1o ) , emission from @xmath1944 to @xmath1940  km  s@xmath5 reveals a north - south velocity gradient across w3(oh ) which is consistent the ch@xmath10oh line as reported in qin et al .",

    "both hcn and hco@xmath0 spectra towards the w3(h@xmath1o ) and w3(oh ) show double peak line profiles while weak hcn v@xmath1=1 line is only seen towards the w3(h@xmath1o ) . in principle , higher energy transitions can only be exictated in the hot regions while lower energy transitions present in the cold surrounding regions , but also in the hot regions .",
    "qin et al . (",
    "2015 ) argued that non - detection of hcn v@xmath1=1 towards the w3(oh ) is due to the fact that the gas seen in the w3(oh ) comes from the outer region of the uc hii region and inner portion of this hot core has been disociated by the stars , and lower hcn abundance and gas temperature of envelope make the hcn v@xmath1=1 too weak and expected intensity is lower than the sma detection limit .",
    "the broad line is seen in hcn but not in hco@xmath0 towards the w3(h@xmath1o ) ( see top panel of figure 3 ) , suggesting that hcn is better tracing the molecular outflow of this region . both hcn and hco@xmath7 show an absorption dip at around @xmath1947.8  km  s@xmath5 , with the blue - shifted peak being stronger ( ` blue profile ' asymmetry ) . on the other side , the hcn v@xmath1=1 line peaks at around @xmath12@xmath1949  km  s@xmath5 , i.  e. , near the position of the absorption dip .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  3 shows the spectra towards the w3(oh ) continuum peak position . differently to the case of w3(h@xmath1o ) , the spectra are prominently red - shifted , i.  e. , with the red - shifted peak being stronger than the blue - shifted one .",
    "this kind of profiles are indicative of gas expansion ( e.  g. , aguti et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the combined sma+cso spectrum at the w3(h@xmath1o ) continuum peak ( top panel of figure 3 ) is only slightly stronger than the sma - only spectrum , indicating that even with only the sma we are recovering most of the hcn emission , as expected for a tracer of compact and dense gas .",
    "the blue side of the sma spectrum at the w3(oh ) continuum peak is much weaker than that of the sma+cso data .",
    "previous observations of single dish and interferometers ( mauersberger , wilson & henkel 1988 ; wilson et al .",
    "1991 , 1993 ; wink et al .",
    "1994 ) suggested that the w3(oh ) complex consists of extended envelope with lower gas density of @xmath1210@xmath20 cm@xmath3 and the compact core w3(h@xmath1o ) with gas density of @xmath1210@xmath22 cm@xmath3 .",
    "the critical density of hcn ( 32 ) is at one order of @xmath1210@xmath22 cm@xmath3 ( at @xmath1250 k ) , so one should see similar spectral profile at the w3(h@xmath1o ) position with the sma and sma+cso .",
    "this is also verified from the channel maps ( see figure 2 ) , in which compact clumps observed by the sma and sma+cso have almost same morphology and extended emission located outside of the compact clumps can only be seen by the sma+cso data . as for the w3(oh ) , the weakness of blue side of the hcn spectrum observed with the sma should be caused by the filtering effect of the interferometer in which lower density gas in front of hii region should show blue - shifted emission if the cloud is in expansion , but can be recovered by single dish observations .",
    "the different line profiles may reflect different kinematcis between the w3(h@xmath1o ) and w3(oh ) . in section  3.2.2 and 3.3",
    ", we discuss the nature of these profiles .",
    "observations showed that molecular line emissions mainly arise from the w3(h@xmath1o ) core with higher gas density while absorption lines are obseved in the w3(oh ) which have lower density ( mauersberger , wilson & henkel 1988 ; wilson et al .",
    "1991 , 1993 , wink et al .",
    "the two sources are spatially separated and have different systemic velocities ( wilson et al .",
    "1991 ; qin et al .",
    "2015 ) , implying different physics and kinematics .",
    "at a large scale , the two sources share same envelope and the background sources will affect the observed optically thick line shapes in both line profile and intensity if the background source has different kinematics .",
    "we think these will not obviously affect the observed line shape and intensity of the w3(h@xmath1o ) since higher density gas dominates kinematics of the compact core as seen from figure 2 and figure 3 .",
    "90% of the molecular matter associated with the w3(oh ) is located behind or to the side of the w3(oh ) hii region ( wilson et al . 1991 ) .",
    "thus one should see ` red asymmetry ' line profile of hcn and hco@xmath0 with comparable read peak line intensity observed by the sma and sma+cso .",
    "an alternative explanation of the line profile toward the w3(oh ) is that w3(oh ) may be located behind w3(h@xmath1o ) and the blue - shifted hcn emission toward this source is absorbed by the dense envelope of the w3(h@xmath1o ) , producing the observed red asymmetry .",
    "if so , one should see similar velocity pattern as in the w3(h@xmath1o ) .",
    "but the blue - shifted peak velocities between the two cores are different ( see figure 3 ) , thus the observed ` red asymmetry ' line profile supports gas expansion in the w3(oh ) region .",
    "previous observations of the co(21 ) line show two large - scale bipolar outflows driven by the w3(h@xmath1o)-a and c sources ( zapata et al .",
    "compared to the co transition , hcn(32 ) has a higher critical density and should trace compact outflows close to the exciting sources .",
    "figure  4 presents the hcn velocity - integrated intensity map of the sma+cso hcn line .",
    "both the blue and red - shifted gas have three emission clumps .",
    "the clumps located close to w3(h@xmath1o ) are likely associated with w3(h@xmath1o)-a , while the other clumps are located to the northeast and southwest of the w3(h@xmath1o)-c source , suggesting that they are tracing an outflow powered by source c. the outflow has a position angle of 54@xmath11 .",
    "assuming that the hcn line wing emission is optically thin , an excitation temperature of 50  k ( as in zapata et al .",
    "2011 ) , and an hcn abundance of 9.6@xmath210@xmath23 ( qin et al .",
    "2015 ) , under local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , we infer an outflow mass of ( 2.6@xmath240.3 )  m@xmath4 with some uncertainties due to the assumptions of optically thin emission , excitation temperature and fractional abundance of hcn .",
    "the estimated dynamic time of the outflow is ( 5.6@xmath240.2)@xmath210@xmath6  yr , and the mass loss rate is @xmath12(4.6@xmath240.5 )  @xmath210@xmath25  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 .",
    "the hcn and hco@xmath0 sma spectra toward the w3(h@xmath1o ) continumm peak position show an absorption dip at around the systemic velocity ( @xmath1947.8  km  s@xmath5 , see figure  3-top ) .",
    "this absorption dip is also visible in the single - dish data ( see figure  1 of wu & evans 2003 ) , indicating that it is not caused by interferometric spatial filtering .",
    "another possible explanation is the presence of two different velocity components , but this is ruled out when examining the higher energy transition of hcn v@xmath1=1 , which is expected to be optically thin and shows a single peak at the position of the absorption dip ( see figure  3-top ) .",
    "therefore , the profile seen in the hcn and hco@xmath0 lines is likely due to these lines being optically thick .",
    "moreover , the blue - shifted peak is stronger than the red - shifted one , showing ` blue profile ' asymmetry .",
    "the classical ` blue asymmetry ' says that the optically thin will peak in the middle of absorption dip of the optically thick line if the emission is from a single source .",
    "but in the w3(h@xmath26o ) case , higher angular observations of continuum and lines have resolved w3(h@xmath26o ) into a and c subcomponents with different systemic velocities , in which sources a and c have systemic velocities of 51.4 and 48.6 km  s@xmath5 ( chen et al .",
    "2006 ) , and 50.5 and 46.5 km s@xmath5 ( zapata et al .",
    "2011 ) respectively .",
    "the hcn v@xmath1=1 line presents east - west velocity gradient ( qin et al .",
    "2015 ) and the emission may contribute from both sources a and c. therefore the peak velocity of hcn v@xmath1=1 does not peak at the hcn absorption dip .",
    "our ` two - layer model ' gave a medium value of 47.8 km s@xmath5 ( see next paragraph ) between 48.6 and 46.5 km s@xmath5 of c component , indicating that gas in falling onto the w3(h@xmath1o)-c .",
    "following mardones et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we use the asymmetry parameter @xmath27  the velocity difference between the peaks of the optically thick line ( @xmath28 ) and the optically thin ( @xmath29 ) lines  to quantify the blue asymmetry of the hcn and hco@xmath0 lines in w3(h@xmath1o ) .",
    "the parameter is defined as @xmath27=(@xmath30/@xmath31@xmath29 , with @xmath31@xmath29 being the line width of the optically thin hcn v@xmath1=1 .",
    "an statistically significant excess of blue asymmetric line profiles with @xmath27@xmath32@xmath33 indicate that the molecular gas is infalling onto the cores ( e.  g. , mardones et al .",

    "although the asymmetry parameters devived from both hcn(32 ) and hco@xmath0(32 ) lines suggest gas infalling motion , the hcn spectrum in the w3(h@xmath1o ) may be confused by the outflows as seen from figure 2 and figure 3 . in the case of hco@xmath0 ( 10 ) ,",

    "recent observations have revealed high mass accretion rates ( 10@xmath310@xmath44  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 ) in other high - mass star forming regions ( e.  g. , sandell , goss & wright 2005 ; garay et al .  2007 ; zapata et al .",

    "2006 ) , and assuming that the collapse is uniform , pressure - free , and non - rotating , the free - fall time ( @xmath46 ) is estimated to be 5@xmath210@xmath8  yr , which is consistent with the outflow time scale .",
    "the assumptions are reasonable since the derived density profile of w3(h@xmath1o ) support free fall collapse ( chen et al .",
    "the infall velocity derived from a two - layer collapse model fit to the hco@xmath0(32 ) line is 2.7@xmath240.3  km  s@xmath5 . assuming that the velocity dispersion ( 0.8@xmath240.1  km  s@xmath5 ) is caused by thermal motions , the large infall velocity suggests that collapse is proceeding in a supersonic way .",

    "based on the relative proper motions of the oh maser spots observed at different epochs towards w3(oh ) , bloemhof , reid & moran ( 1992 ) proposed gas expansion from the uc hii region to explain the observed pattern of motions .",
    "furthermore , a direct measurement of expansion of the w3(oh ) was made through the different difference maps obtained by the vla at three epochs ( kawamura & masson 1998 ) .",
    "they suggest that the shell - like hii region is slowly expanding with a typical speed of 35  km  s@xmath5 and derive a dynamical age of @xmath122300  yr .",
    "the hcn red profile and hco@xmath0 p - cygni profile towards the w3(oh ) continuum peak position suggest that the gas in the envelope is expanding ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "the two - layer model results in mean expansion velocities of 3.8@xmath240.4  km  s@xmath5 and 1.6@xmath240.2  km  s@xmath5 , respectively . considering the different critical densities of the two transitions ,",
    "this suggests that the expansion of the envelope is decelerating .",
    "flux ratio map of _ spitzer_/irac 4.5  @xmath39 m and 3.6  @xmath39 m images shows a radial distribution from inside to outside , with the largest ratios found around the w3(oh ) continuum source , likely pinpointing w3(oh ) as the expansion center .",
    "ratios larger than 1.5 indicate shocked gas , likely produced by the interaction of the expanding hii region and the molecular cloud . at the distance of w3(oh ) ( 2.2  kpc ; hachisuka et al .",
    "2006 ) , the shock radius of 25@xmath15 ( see figure  7 ) and the expanding velocity of 3.8@xmath240.4  km  s@xmath5 ( derived from hcn line ) result in an expanding timescale of about ( 6.4@xmath240.7)@xmath210@xmath9  yr . this value is larger than the timescale of 2300  yr derived by kawamura & masson ( 1998 ) , but lower than the typical age of 10@xmath20  yr for uchii regions .",
    "we do think that the expansion timescale of w3(oh ) as derived in this work is reasonable , since the timescale of infall and outflow motions in the w3(h@xmath1o ) is approximately 5@xmath210@xmath8  yr , and w3(h@xmath1o ) is likely at an earlier evolutionary stage compared to w3(oh ) .",
    "the w3(oh ) complex is an nearby star formation region harboring two sites of high - mass star formation , w3(h@xmath1o ) and w3(oh ) , with different properties .",
    "w3(h@xmath1o ) is rich in water masers and organic molecules , and at earlier evolutionary stage compared to w3(oh ) , which is associated with an uchii region and is rich in oh masers .",
    "previous observations of oh masers and nh@xmath10 absorption features suggest a collapsing outer envelope outside the uchii region .",
    "our cso grid spectra of the hcn(32 ) line ( see figure  1 ) show a ` blue profile ' in a large area suggesting that collapse is not happening only around the uchii region but it is a global collapse in the w3(oh ) complex .    at small scales ,",
    "the two sources have different kinematics , based on both previous studies and the observations presented in this work .",
    "a small - scale non - thermal radio jet and water maser outflows along the east - west direction together with large scale co outflows and a rotating disk candidate have been reported towards in w3(h@xmath1o ) in previous works .",
    "complementary to this , our hcn and hco@xmath0 line results show infall and outflow motions , and a flattened structure perpendicular to the direction of the outflows . at the same time , relative proper motions of oh maser spots and multi - epoch radio continuum maps suggest the presence of expansion motions originated from the w3(oh ) uch ii region .",
    "our molecular line observations , combined with _",
    "spitzer_/irac images confirms the expansion interpretation with w3(oh ) being located at the center . from the expansion velocity derived with the two - layer model fit and the size of the shocked gas as revealed by the irac images , we determine an expansion timescale of ( 6.4@xmath240.7)@xmath210@xmath9  yr .    based on the above statements , we present a sketch of the dynamical state of the w3(oh ) complex in figure  8 .",
    "we describe the picture in the following .",
    "the w3(oh ) complex harbors w3(h@xmath1o ) and w3(oh ) , with w3(h@xmath1o ) being in an earlier evolutionary stage of massive star formation compared to w3(oh ) , who has already developed an hii region .",
    "far from the forming stars , the outer envelope of the w3(oh ) complex is collapsing inwards . inside the complex , w3(h@xmath1o ) is still undergoing collapse and is associated with collimated outflowing material . on the other side the hii region of w3(oh ) is expanding and driving a shock front into the ambient material , which leads to the observed neutral gas expansion and shock .",
    "we have carried out sma and cso observations of different molecular tracers ( hcn and hco@xmath0 lines ) towards the w3(oh ) star forming complex .",
    "the results are summarized in the following .",
    "* the cso grid spectral observations of hcn show a blue asymmetric profile over a large area covering the whole star forming complex , which suggests that the outer envelope of the w3(oh ) complex is undergoing global collapse . *",

    "a two - layer collapse model is used to fit the hco@xmath0 line shape .",

    "the free fall timescale is estimated to be 5@xmath210@xmath6  yr . * bipolar outflows , identified in the hcn images , are likely driven by the source c in w3(h@xmath1o ) .",

    "the dynamic time scale of the outflows is around ( 5.6@xmath240.2)@xmath210@xmath6  yr , consistent with the free fall timescale .",
