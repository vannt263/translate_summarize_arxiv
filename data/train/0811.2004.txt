    "there has been a recent renaissance of interest in cosmic strings ( see e.g @xcite ) as a mechanism contributing to the spectrum of primordial cosmological perturbations and the corresponding anisotropies in cosmic microwave anisotropy ( cmb ) maps . in part this renewed interest is sparked by the realization that many supergravity models of inflation also lead to the production of strings at the end of the period of inflation @xcite .",
    "in addition , many models of inflation in the context of string theory predict the formation of a network of strings at the end of the inflationary phase @xcite .",
    "the conditions under which these cosmic superstrings @xcite are stable have been explored in @xcite .",
    "cosmic superstrings may also arise in other approaches to superstring cosmology such as the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite or string gas cosmology @xcite .",
    "if matter is described by a particle physics model which admits stable strings forming after inflation , then by causality it is inevitable that a network of such strings will form during the cosmological phase transition which corresponds to the symmetry breaking which is responsible for the existence of the strings @xcite .",
    "it is inevitable that the network of strings contains  infinite \" strings ( strings crossing the entire volume ) . for applications in cosmology one divides the strings into  loops \" ( loops of cosmic string with a curvature radius smaller than the hubble radius @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the cosmological expansion rate ) and  long strings \" ( infinite strings and loops with curvature radius larger than the hubble radius ) .",
    "the causality argument @xcite ( see also @xcite for some standard reviews on cosmic strings and structure formation , and @xcite for the original references ) implies , in fact , that at all times after the phase transition a network of long strings with a correlation length ( mean curvature radius ) comparable or smaller than the hubble radius will survive . it can be argued @xcite that a network of ( non - superconducting ) strings will approach a  scaling solution \" for which at all late times @xmath2 the correlation length of the network of long strings is a fixed fraction of the hubble radius .    cosmic strings @xcite are described by their mass per unit length @xmath3 which is usually quoted in terms of the dimensionless number @xmath4 , @xmath5 being newton s gravitational constant .",
    "a straight string has a tension which is equal in magnitude to @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the effective action which describes the motion of a straight string is the nambu - goto action , the same action which describes fundamental strings . since cosmic strings carry energy , they will lead to density fluctuations and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies",
    "the network of cosmic strings will generate a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations @xcite .",
    "more relevant to the current paper , cosmic strings generate a very specific signature in cosmic microwave background anisotropy maps , namely line discontinuities @xcite .",
    "these line discontinuities arise since space perpendicular to a cosmic string is a cone with deficit angle given by @xcite = 8 g . since the motion of cosmic strings is relativistic , photons passing on different sides of the string moving with a velocity @xmath6 perpendicular to the plane spanned by the string direction and the line of sight between the observer and the string will be seen by the observer with a relative doppler shift [ kssig ] t t = 8 ( v ) v g , where @xmath7 is the relativistic gamma factor ( see figure 1 ) . looking in direction of the string",
    ", we will see a line in the sky across which the cmb temperature jumps by the above amount .",
    "we will denote this effect , the kaiser - stebbins effect , as the ks effect in the rest of the paper .",
    "the conical deformation of space induced by a  long \" cosmic string has a length of the order the hubble radius , i.e. of the order of @xmath2 in direction of the string . since cosmic strings are formed in a phase transition and the effects of the transition travel with the speed of light , the depth of the region affected by the string ( in direction perpendicular to the string ) is @xmath2 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "hence , each string between @xmath8 and @xmath9 whose  zone of influence \" is intersected by the past light cone of the observer will induce a line discontinuity in the cmb temperature map with length @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a random number in the interval @xmath12 which takes into account the random angle of the velocity vector of the string relative to the plane determined by the string direction and the observer s line of sight to the string .",
    "the anisotropy pattern induced by a single string segment contains several edges .",
    "there is the central line discontinuity ( [ kssig ] ) coming from photons which pass on different sides of the string . since the deficit angle in figure [ fig:1 ] has finite depth ( in direction @xmath13 ) ,",
    "as explained in the previous paragraph there will be two edges ( again sharp because the deficit angle sharply decreases to zero @xcite ) with half the value of @xmath14 .",
    "finally , our modelling of the string network in terms of straight segments introduces the sharp `` boundary '' edges perpendicular to the central edge ( see also figure [ teststringmap ] ) .    to detect the line discontinuities in cmb maps produced by cosmic strings ,",
    "it is important to have small angular resolution . strings present in the universe between the time of last scattering and the present time contribute to the signal .",
    "however , according to the cosmic string scaling solution , the most numerous strings are those present at or shortly after last scattering .",
    "the hubble radius at that time subtends an angle of about @xmath15 . if the angular resolution is not much smaller than this angle , then the anisotropies produced by these strings will not be distinguishable from anisotropies produced by gaussian noise with the corresponding coherence length . on the other hand ,",
    "full sky coverage is not essential .",
    "thus , ground - based small angular resolution surveys such as act @xcite or the south pole telescope @xcite both of which have angular resolution of about @xmath16 are ideal to search for strings .",
    "the planck satellite experiment @xcite with an angular resolution of about @xmath17 will also yield a good data set to use , in particular since the systematic errors in the data will likely be smaller .",
    "the ks effect is a part of the  integrated sachs - wolfe \" @xcite contribution to cmb anisotropies .",
    "the primordial cosmological fluctuations produced by strings also contribute to the regular sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "in contrast to cosmological fluctuations produced in inflationary cosmology , those produced by cosmic strings are  incoherent \" and  active \" as opposed to  coherent \" and  passive \" @xcite .",
    "the string network is continuously seeding growing curvature fluctuations on super - hubble scales , and therefore the fluctuations enter the hubble radius not as standing waves . as a consequence ,",
    "the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies does not have @xcite the acoustic ringing associated with coherent passive fluctuations @xcite . since acoustic ringing has been observed with recent high precision cmb measurements @xcite , it is now clear that cosmic strings can not be the main source of cosmological fluctuations .",
    "their contribution is bounded from the accurate measurements of the angular power spectrum of the cmb in the region of the first acoustic peak to be less than @xmath18 @xcite which corresponds to a value of @xmath4 of about @xmath19 . in the literature",
    ", one finds slightly stronger constraints which come from pulsar timing data @xcite . however , pulsar bounds make use of estimates of the spectrum of gravitational radiation from cosmic string loops . since there is still a lot of uncertainty about the distribution of cosmic string loops , and since the amount of gravitational radiation from a fixed loop is also rather uncertain , bounds on @xmath4 coming from millisecond pulsar timing are not very robust .",
    "much more robust signatures come from the long and straight strings , signatures which we are discussing in this paper .    early work to identify the ks signal of cosmic strings in cmb anisotropy maps was presented in @xcite which concluded that the angular resolution of wmap would not be small enough to resolve the ks signature . after the release of the wmap data @xcite ,",
    "there were two sets of analyses introducing new algorithms to look specifically for the ks signature .",
    "lo and wright @xcite applied a matched filtering method , whereas jeong and smoot @xcite introduced new statistics such as one measuring the connectedness of neighboring temperature steps or another one proposing a decomposition of the temperature map into constant , gaussian and straight string step components .",
    "both groups applied their statistics to the wmap data . from the null results of the searches ,",
    "a direct upper bound on the string tension of @xmath20 could be set , a bound not competitive with the existing bounds from the matching of the angular power spectrum .    in @xcite , it was proposed to make use of the canny algorithm @xcite to search for the ks effect , and the preliminary analysis showed that the statistic offers the promise to improve the limit on @xmath4 from direct searches for the ks signal by a large factor .",
    "the canny algorithm is an edge detection algorithm which was previously used in image recognition work and metallurgy .",
    "it looks for lines in a map across which there is a large gradient .",
    "thus , the algorithm appears to be well suited to detect the ks signature . in this paper",
    "we present a new and improved implementation of the canny algorithm and apply it to test data . in agreement with @xcite ( and with the followup paper @xcite ) , we find the new analysis based on the canny algorithm is able to find or rule out strings with a tension greater than an upper bound which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than previous bounds derived from looking for the ks signature of strings .",
    "we emphasize that the code on which this paper is based was developed completely independently from that used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is different in structure and in fact is based on a different programming language .",
    "the fact that the results reported here agree with those in @xcite presents a very important check on the methods .",
    "the canny algorithm works in position space . starting from an anisotropy map",
    ", it first produces an `` edge map '' , the edges corresponding to lines in the sky perpendicular to which the gradient of the anisotropy map is sufficiently large .",
    "the edge detection algorithm must be able to take into account the fact that gaussian noise superimposed on top of the cosmic string signal will produce large variations in the magnitude of the gradient along a cosmic string edge . given the edge map , a second algorithm counts the number of edges of fixed length and produces a histogram of edge lengths .",
    "both the edge detection and the edge counting algorithms contain various parameters and thresholds which can be set by the user and which can be tuned to give the algorithm maximal discriminatory power , and are improved over the original code presented in @xcite .",
    "the values of the thresholds and parameters will depend on the specific data .",
    "the final step of the code is a statistical comparison between the histograms produced in the previous step for data with and without cosmic strings .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the following section we discuss the construction of the test data maps - both the pure gaussian maps and the maps containing cosmic strings . in section 3",
    "we present the new implementation of the canny algorithm .",
    "we first describe the algorithm which takes the cmb temperature map and converts it into an edge map .",
    "then , we turn to the separate algorithm which is used to produce a histogram of edge lengths .",
    "section 4 presents the results from the application of the canny algorithm to the test maps .",
    "we conclude with a summary of the method and results , focusing on refinements of the code which can be made to improve the code s discriminatory power , and give a preview of future applications .",
    "in this section we describe the codes which were used to create the simulated temperature maps .",
    "the maps have two components , firstly a gaussian map with an angular power spectrum corresponding to the inflationary  concordance model \" , the second a map of anisotropies produced by long cosmic strings according to the ks effect .",
    "these simulation routines have been created from scratch , without using any input from the existing code @xcite .",
    "the simulation routines are written in interactive data language ( idl ) . both for the inflationary fluctuations and the cosmic string maps ,",
    "the theory predicts ensemble averages from which particular classical realizations are drawn . to obtain firm predictions",
    ", a large number of simulations must therefore be run .",
    "since we have in mind applying our code to surveys with small angular resolution but only partial sky coverage , we work in the `` flat sky '' approximation @xcite in which a segment of the sky is approximated by a rectangle .",
    "this approximation is made because of computational ease , since the basis solutions of the wave equation in flat space , the fourier modes , are much easier to work with than the basis functions on a sphere , the spherical harmonics .",
    "first we create a square grid temperature map of the gaussian inflationary perturbations .",
    "the grid size is set by the angular resolution and by the angular size of the survey which we want to simulate ( the number of grid points along an axis is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the extent of the survey along the axis being considered , and @xmath23 is the angular resolution ) . the map is constructed based on the angular power spectrum of cmb fluctuations computed using one of the standard codes used in the literature ( see below ) .    a differential temperature value , @xmath24 , ( corresponding to the temperature with the monopole subtracted ) is assigned to each grid point @xmath25 ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 are integers ) of the map , where each grid point represents a position in the window of the observed sky . if @xmath22 is the length of a side of the window of observation in degrees in the first coordinate direction , then the angular distance of a grid point @xmath25 from the edge is @xmath28 .",
    "the two dimensional vector is designated by @xmath29 .",
    "the code is designed to construct a square grid .",
    "if rectangular areas are needed , we can construct a larger square temperature map and cut out the appropriate rectangle from this larger grid .",
    "the applicable scales are less than @xmath30 indicating the applicability of the `` flat sky '' approximation .    in general , the temperature anisotropy of the cmb is expressed in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 being latitude and longitude , respectively : ( , ) = _ l , m a_lmy_lm ( , ) where @xmath34 are the coefficients of the expansion .",
    "however , since the observed window will be less than 60 degrees ( we will take it to be approximately 10 degrees ) , plane waves can be substituted for @xmath35 per the flat sky approximation : ( ) = _ k t()e^i .",
    "( n.b . in the following equations @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) comparing these equations , it is obvious that the coefficients @xmath38 correspond to @xmath34 so that : [ anglerel ] t()^2 = a_lm^2 c_l(k ) , in which the angular brackets stand for ensemble averaging , and the @xmath39 give the angular power spectrum of the cmb . according to the ergodic hypothesis ,",
    "the ensemble average is equivalent to the spatial average .",
    "thus , a_lm^2 = _ m =- l^l a_lm^2 , which , as indicated in ( [ anglerel ] ) is the square of the width of a gaussian distribution , namely @xmath38 .",
    "the probability of a given @xmath38 follows a gaussian distribution just as the @xmath34 follow a gaussian distribution .",
    "the temperature map in fourier space , @xmath38 , is arranged into a grid in which each grid point is assigned physical angular coordinate values @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which are related to the numerical @xmath42 and @xmath43 values ( each ranging between 0 and @xmath44 ) by k_x & = & ( k_xn - k_max ) + k_y & = & ( k_yn - k_max ) in which the @xmath45 and @xmath46 values run from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath48 corresponds to the angular resolution of the data set . note that this setup requires us to have an odd number of pixels in our gaussian map .",
    "if an even number of pixels is required , the gaussian map can be stripped of a row and column once it is constructed .    using = = ,",
    "in which the wavelength , @xmath49 is measured in degrees and the wavenumber @xmath50 is measured in inverse degrees , we compute the dependence of the degree of the spherical harmonic ( mode number ) @xmath51 on the magnitude @xmath50 of @xmath52 .",
    "once this is done , we can look up the corresponding @xmath53 for each @xmath52 from the output of a standard cmb simulation code ( see below ) . since @xmath51 is not necessarily an integer , for each value of @xmath50",
    ", the program then determines the value @xmath54 by linear interpolation between the @xmath53 values of the two closest values of @xmath55 corresponding to each @xmath51 .",
    "given the @xmath53 values determined as described above , the fourier space temperature map @xmath56 can be determined by t(k_x , k_y ) = ( g_1(k_x , k_y)+ig_2(k_x , k_y ) ) where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are randomly generated numbers obtained from a gaussian distribution with variance one and mean of zero .",
    "since the position space temperature map @xmath59 must be real , then @xmath38 must satisfy @xmath60 .    in summary",
    ", we derive @xmath38 from the values of @xmath53 determined as described above , and @xmath61 making use of the hermitian property .",
    "finally , to compute @xmath59 , we perform a fast fourier transform on @xmath38 .",
    "figure ( [ fig : testgaussianmap ] ) shows the output of a temperature map with pure gaussian noise .     and a resolution of 1.5 arcminutes . ]",
    "we use the code for anisotropies in the microwave background ( camb ) @xcite to generate the cmb temperature map generated by inflationary perturbations .",
    "camb , like the code on which it is based , cmbfast @xcite , employs the line of sight integration prescription to compute cmb anisotropies .",
    "the advantage of using camb is that it computes @xmath53 s for higher @xmath55 s .",
    "whereas cmbfast can at best compute the power spectrum to @xmath62 , corresponding to a resolution of 10 arcminutes , we use a power spectrum generated by camb up to @xmath63 , corresponding to a resolution of 1.39 arcminutes .",
    "simulations with higher resolution will enable us to place lower bounds on the string tension of cosmic strings .",
    "additionally , high resolutions are necessary to apply our algorithm in the future high resolution cmb experiments such as acbar @xcite and the south pole telescope @xcite .",
    "the parameters we use for our simulations are standard @xmath64cdm concordance parameters based on fitting the model to a multi - experiment data set cmball @xcite , namely @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( the equation of state for dark energy ) , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( the temperature of the cmb ) , @xmath73 , and reionization optical depth , @xmath74 .",
    "next we generate a temperature map of superimposed straight line segments representing the effects of long cosmic strings obeying the scaling solution . as in the gaussian simulation ,",
    "each grid point is assigned a temperature fluctuation @xmath24 .    for simplicity we do not include the effects of string loops or of the small scale structure on the strings . according to the current status of cosmic string simulations ,",
    "the effects of long strings dominate the cosmic string cmb sky .",
    "small - scale structure on the long strings would maintain the ks effect ( albeit with slightly reduced amplitude ) .",
    "thus , in terms of searching for the ks signature of strings , the simplifications we use can be justified as a first step .",
    "going beyond this approximation would require much more involved simulations ( like those of @xcite ) with many more parameters .",
    ", the cosmic string evolution can not be followed either analytically or numerically without making additional assumptions , in particular on how cosmic strings interact .",
    "the results obtained in different numerical analyses concerning the string loop distribution vary by orders of magnitude ( see e.g. the different results obtained in @xcite ) , whereas the results for the distribution of long strings are comparable . thus , whereas limits based on long strings are robust , those which include effects of string loops are not . ] in future work we plan to apply our canny algorithm code to temperature maps obtained from more sophisticated simulations that include more detailed structure of cosmic strings .",
    "in contrast to the gaussian string map which is set up in fourier space and transformed to position space via a fourier transform , the string maps are set up directly in position space . as explained in the introduction , each long string whose region of influence intersects the past light cone of the window in the sky we are considering will contribute a ks signal .",
    "we assume that the area in the sky affected by the temperature discontinuity of a single straight string segment per the ks effect is a rectangular box on each side of the string .",
    "the depth of the box ( length perpendicular to the string ) is equal to the hubble length @xcite .",
    "the size of the box in direction of the string is taken to be the product of the hubble length and a length coefficient @xmath75 .",
    "the hubble length corresponds to the time at which the past light cone intersects the region of influence of the string .",
    "we apply the ks signature by adding a positive temperature fluctuation to grid points in the box on one side of the string , and by adding the corresponding negative temperature fluctuation to the grid points in the box on the other side of the string .",
    "we are using a toy model for the cosmic string distribution first introduced in @xcite and also used by pogosian et al . in @xcite .",
    "it is based on a simple representation of the distribution of long strings as described by the scaling solution .",
    "according to this solution , the distribution of long strings is at all times like a random walk with a step length which is of the order of the hubble radius at that time . we will denote this length by @xmath76 , where @xmath75 is a constant factor of order one .",
    "physically , this length represents the mean curvature radius of the string network . in the toy model",
    ", this distribution is approximated by a collection of straight string segments of length @xmath76 .",
    "one can argue that the curvature radius of the network of long strings must be of the order of the hubble radius .",
    "if the curvature radius is larger than the hubble radius , the strings will sit there as the universe expands until the hubble radius catches up .",
    "if the curvature radius is less than the hubble radius , then the strings will oscillate wildly , intersect and split off string loops ( which then decay by gravitational radiation ) until the curvature radius catches up to the hubble radius .",
    "so the curvature radius will always be of order of the hubble radius .",
    "the key ingredients in this argument are , firstly , that the effective action for a cosmic string is the nambu - goto action and hence the string dynamics is relativistic , and secondly that when strings cross they will intercommute , i.e. exchange ends , thus allowing the production of string loops .    since the strings are relativistic , the distribution of strings will have changed after one hubble time . snapshots of string distributions at time steps separated by hubble time intervals will , when rescaled to the hubble radius , look like independent realizations of a stochastic process . hence ,",
    "in our toy model of the distribution of long strings , we take the string segments to be independently distributed over time intervals greater than a hubble time .",
    "the input parameters for the string map generating function are the number of pixels on each side of the window , the number of degrees the window subtends , the number of strings per hubble volume per the scaling solution , the string tension , @xmath4 , and the length coefficient @xmath75 .",
    "the procedure to simulate cosmic strings is to follow the past light cone in time intervals @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , from the time of last scattering to the present time . if @xmath79 then there are approximately 15 time intervals .",
    "next we project all strings present in one hubble time interval to a fixed time hypersurface at the center of the time interval .",
    "this is done for all time intervals . on the microwave sky ,",
    "the hubble length in degrees corresponding to the comoving distance of the hubble radius in space at the nth time interval can be shown to be ( making use of the equation of state and of the friedmann equation ) d_c(t_n+1 ) = d_c(t_n)_1 ^ 1/3 , in which @xmath80 is in degrees .",
    "this recursion relation starts with @xmath81 .",
    "we need to find all of the strings which for a fixed time interval influence the cmb temperature map of the observed window . instead of simulating only strings in the observed window",
    ", we must consider all strings in an extended window .",
    "this protects us from missing strings that start outside of the observed window but extend into it . at each time interval ,",
    "the extended window is a square with each side subtending the degrees of the observed window added to twice the hubble distance for that time step .",
    "the observed window is the central section with one hubble length on either side .",
    "next we compute the number of hubble volumes the extended window subtends at each time step , and the number of strings in each extended window .",
    "the number of hubble volumes is obtained as the square of the number of degrees subtended by each extended window divided by the degrees subtended by each hubble distance .",
    "the number of strings expected in the extended window for each time step is the rounded product of the strings per hubble volume ( determined as an input parameter based on the scaling solution ) and the fraction / number of hubble volumes a window subtends for each of the 15 time intervals .",
    "next we loop through each time step and each expected string in the extended window to determine where the string should be placed in the extended window and to place it by constructing a temperature differential .",
    "this is completed in a separate function in the program .    to simulate the strings",
    ", the program randomly places a line segment with a length given by @xmath82 , where the hubble length @xmath83 is in radians for the given time step .",
    "the angle @xmath84 runs from 0 to @xmath85 . multiplying by @xmath86 accounts for a projection from three to two dimensions .",
    "although technically the length of the string should be multiplied by a coefficient given by projecting a geodesic on a sphere onto a plane , since we are dealing with small window sizes and the flat sky approximation is appropriate , this complication is unnecessary .",
    "the location of the beginning of the string and its direction are determined randomly .",
    "the location of the beginning of the string is given by taking the product of a random number between 0 and 1 for both directions on the grid and the length of the extended window in radians .",
    "the direction of the placement of the string , i.e. the angle @xmath32 of the string , is chosen by a randomly generated number between @xmath87 and @xmath85 .",
    "this is the direction of the string as given by the angle from the x - axis .",
    "finally , a binary flag is used to determine which side of the string will be a positive temperature fluctuation and which side will be a negative temperature fluctuation . the value of the flag is randomly determined .",
    "next the code computes ( from the location of the start of the string and the direction of the string ) the end point of the string and each corner of the box around each side of the string and each slope for each boundary of the box .    the routine loops over each pixel in the observed window , starting in the lower left hand corner , to determine if the pixel lies within the box affected by the cosmic string .",
    "if it does , the temperature is changed by @xmath14 .",
    "the sign of @xmath14 is determined by the temperature flag delineated above .",
    "the temperature fluctuation is given by = r4 g in which @xmath88 is the background cmb temperature . in the above",
    ", @xmath89 represents the root mean square ( over all strings ) value of @xmath90 , where @xmath6 is the transverse velocity of the string and its relativistic @xmath75 factor is @xmath7 .",
    "also , @xmath91 a random number between 0 and 1 which adjusts the velocity to take into consideration the different velocities that the string might have as well as the projection of the velocity of the string onto the plane perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "based on recent cosmic string evolution simulations we use the value @xmath92 .",
    "figure [ teststringmap ] shows the temperature map produced by a simulation with a few test cosmic strings ( not a scaling solution ) .",
    "the temperature boxes produced by the individual strings are clearly visible .",
    "figure [ stringmapn=1 ] demonstrates the corresponding results from a full string simulation with @xmath93 , i.e. one string per hubble volume .",
    "the straight line temperature discontinuities produced by individual strings are still visible .",
    "however , there are a lot of overlap regions since a given photon will during its trajectory pass close to several strings .",
    "the overlapping problem gets worse for @xmath94 , as clearly visible in figure [ stringmapn=10 ] .        .",
    "the discontinuity lines in the maps produced by the ks effect are clearly visible , but there are a lot of overlap regions where a number of strings affect the temperature at a fixed point . ]    . in this case",
    "the effects of overlaps is much more pronounced . ]    as a further test of the algorithm described in this subsection we show the resulting angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies .",
    "the figure ( figure [ clspectrum ] ) is for a pure cosmic string map with @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the range of @xmath55 values are limited from below by the angular size of the simulation box , and from above by the angular resolution we have chosen .",
    "the error bars are standard errors of the mean based on @xmath96 runs . as theory predicts @xcite",
    ", the angular power spectrum is approximately scale - invariant on large angular scales ( the deviation from scale - invariance at the lowest values of @xmath55 is presumably a boundary effect ) , and its amplitude is consistent with what is expected .     and",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath55 , the vertical axis is @xmath97 . ]",
    "our goal is to test if the canny algorithm is able to pick out the ks signature from strings even if the strings are a subdominant component to the cmb fluctuations . to test this",
    ", we need to produce temperature maps which contain both cosmic strings for some value of @xmath4 and a spectrum of gaussian fluctuations like in the concordance @xmath64cdm model , except with an amplitude of the gaussian noise which is reduced such that the total angular cmb power spectrum remains consistent with either simulations or observations .    here",
    "we describe how to find the coefficient , @xmath98 , for each map which will be used to add the pure string map to the pure gaussian map to get a gaussian map with superimposed strings , t_g+s ( ) = at_g ( ) + t_s ( ) , with @xmath99 as the temperature of the gaussian map plus pure string map and @xmath100 and @xmath101 as the temperature maps of the concordance gaussian and string simulations respectively .",
    "alternatively , we could use the temperature map of the best current data , the five year results of wmap @xcite , for @xmath100 .",
    "it is important to use consistently either the temperature map from experimental data or from theoretical simulations for both @xmath100 and @xmath99 since the @xmath53 s for the two models are not identical .",
    "we want the model to give the best possible agreement with the data , either experimental or simulated .",
    "hence , the plan is to adjust the coefficient @xmath98 so that the combined string and gaussian map , @xmath102 , fits the data best .",
    "this means that we adjust the gaussian map so that the corresponding @xmath53 s of @xmath102 give an optimal fit to the data .",
    "since the error bars on the observed angular power spectrum @xmath53 are smallest relative to the signal in the range from @xmath103 to @xmath104 we shall fit the @xmath53 s within this range .",
    "note that this range includes most of the first doppler peak region .",
    "now for values of @xmath55 comparable or larger than that corresponding to the first doppler peak , the contribution from strings is dominated not by the kaiser - stebbins effect from strings between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , but from string - induced fluctuations at last scattering which are not included in our analysis .",
    "thus , there is an intrinsic inaccuracy in the determination of the value of @xmath98 . if we were to take @xmath105 to be the value where the kaiser - stebbins effect ceases to be dominant",
    "( a value much smaller than @xmath106 ) , then we would obtain a smaller value for @xmath98 and hence a better discriminatory power of our algorithm . however , this procedure would be worse than the one we have adopted , since we would be working with a power spectrum which is a much worse fit to the observations in the doppler peak region than the one we are using . our choice of @xmath105 can thus to be considered to be a conservative one .",
    "the first step is to find the @xmath53 values from the pure string map . to do this ,",
    "the routine initially takes the inverse fft of the temperature fluctuation @xmath59 to compute @xmath38 .",
    "then , using @xmath107 , the routine computes the wave number magnitudes @xmath108 for all values of @xmath55 in the our range .",
    "then the value of @xmath109 corresponding to @xmath110 is found .",
    "next , the map summation routine finds the wavenumber magnitude @xmath50 for all values of @xmath52 ( whose components range from @xmath47 to @xmath48 ) . for each value of @xmath55 in the range between @xmath111 and @xmath105",
    "the code finds the components @xmath40 and @xmath41 of all waves for which the magnitude of @xmath50 lies within @xmath109 of @xmath108 . knowing @xmath42 and @xmath43 we can find the corresponding @xmath112 for each of the wavenumbers .",
    "once all of the @xmath112 values are found for each @xmath55 , we find the average to get @xmath113 for each @xmath55 .",
    "these values are the @xmath53 values of the pure cosmic string map for all @xmath55 between @xmath111 and @xmath105 .    since t_g+s ( ) = at_g ( ) + t_s ( )",
    "we obtain t_g+s()^2 = a^2t_g()^2 + t_s()^2 + 2at_g()t_s ( ) .",
    "however , @xmath114 because the gaussian and string temperature fluctuations are independent .",
    "hence [ equal ] c_l(g+s ) = a^2c_l(g ) + c_l(s ) .",
    "now that we have the @xmath53 values for the simulated camb data , @xmath115 , the @xmath53 s we found for the pure cosmic string map , @xmath116 , and the @xmath53 s for the simulated gaussian map from camb , @xmath117 , we can compute @xmath118 for each @xmath55 by viewing ( [ equal ] ) as a defining relation for @xmath118 .",
    "obviously , for each value of @xmath55 we will get a different answer . to compute a single coefficient @xmath98 which best fits all of the @xmath55 s from @xmath111 to @xmath105 we perform a linear fit on the coefficients , @xmath98 , for each @xmath55 .",
    "we use the best fit @xmath119intercept of a linear model fit by minimizing the @xmath120 error statistic for @xmath98 .",
    "the y - intercept can be used because the slope of the best fit to the linear model is negligible .",
    "once @xmath98 is found for a particular string image , the result is averaged over all of the generated simulated string images to obtain the final value for @xmath98 which is then used for all the string maps of a given @xmath121 .    figure ( [ combinedmaphigh ] ) shows the resulting cmb anisotropy map in a simulation with a large value of @xmath4 chosen such that the strings play an important role . comparing the map to the pure string map of figure ( [ stringmapn=10 ] )",
    "we see that the string - induced line discontinuities are still visible .",
    "however , in the case of a lower value of @xmath4 the effects of the strings are not visible by eye and we need to resort to a statistical analysis to study whether the map is distinguishable from that of pure gaussian noise ( figure ( [ combinedmaplow ] ) ) .",
    "and@xmath94 . in this case",
    "the ks discontinuity lines are visible . ]    , namely @xmath122 and @xmath94 . in this case",
    "the ks lines are not visible by eye . ]",
    "we use the algorithms described in this section to generate maps with and without cosmic string signals .",
    "the main question we would like to address now is down to what value of @xmath4 the canny edge detection algorithm is capable of distinguishing between these two sets of maps in a statistically significant way . in the following section we describe our realization of the canny algorithm routine which turns a microwave temperature map into an edge map , the edges standing for lines across which the gradient is a local maximum .",
    "in this section we describe our implementation of the canny algorithm . in its original version @xcite",
    ", the canny algorithm is intended to find lines in the map with maximal gradients across the line . in this way",
    ", the algorithm can be applied to the image of a face and returns a map where only the pixels of the map with the strongest features are shaded in .",
    "similarly , the algorithm could be applied to find crystal defect lines on metallic surfaces .",
    "our original work applying the canny algorithm to cmb maps @xcite also was based on this idea .    however , to look for cosmic strings we are less interested in the local maxima of the gradient map which overall have maximal amplitude . rather , we are interested in local maxima of the gradient for which the amplitude of the gradient is in correspondence to the expected ks signal .",
    "thus , in contrast to the original canny routine which uses two thresholds , we here introduce a modified algorithm in which three gradient thresholds are made use of ( as in @xcite ) . the use of the thresholds is described below .",
    "we will first give a brief overview of how the algorithm works .",
    "first , an optional part of the canny algorithm is to smooth the map in order to eliminate shot noise .",
    "the second step in the algorithm is to construct a map of the temperature gradients .",
    "next , locations must be identified which correspond to local maxima of the gradients .",
    "the maximal average gradient of the pure string map determines the three thresholds used .",
    "the fourth part of the algorithm involves selecting among the grid points identified as local maxima those which have the right range of magnitudes .",
    "gradients larger than some upper threshold are not due to single strings and will hence be discarded .",
    "those above a second threshold quite close to the expected edge strength will be kept . to take into account the fact that gaussian noise may well decrease the amplitude of some pixel along a string edge below the above - mentioned threshold ,",
    "we introduce a third ( the lowest ) threshold and keep the pixels whose gradient is larger than that threshold , provided that the pixel is connected to a pixel with gradient amplitude above the second threshold ( and provided that the gradient directions are appropriate and that the pixel is connected to a pixel in one of the allowed directions relative to the gradient ) .",
    "the pixels thus selected form the canny edge map . given the pixel edge map ,",
    "a next step in the algorithm is to identify the edges in the pixel edge map .",
    "the length of each edge is found , and a histogram of edge lengths is produced .",
    "the analysis part of the algorithm then checks if for a fixed value of @xmath4 the histograms of a pure gaussian noise map and of a noise map including a contribution of cosmic strings ( and appropriately reduced amplitude of the gaussian noise ) are statistically significantly different .    in implementing the canny algorithm ,",
    "several ( three ) choices must be made beyond fixing the three thresholds used .",
    "we look for the set of choices which give the best differentiation between maps with and without strings .",
    "the first step in our implementation of the canny algorithm is the filtering of the data .",
    "this filtering is intended to eliminate point source noise . in studies like the present one in which we are dealing with simulated data which has no noise ,",
    "the maps can be used without smoothing . in order to eliminate point sources , smoothing should be used in the case of real data .",
    "we have explored the effects which smoothing has .",
    "the routine first produces an un - normalized filter map @xmath123 ( @xmath124 and @xmath125 are integer labels running from @xmath126 to @xmath127 indexing the pixels of the filter map ) [ filter ] f(i , j ) = e^- in which @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath127 is the number of pixels along one direction of the filter map , an input parameter in the smoothing routine .",
    "the normalization is the sum of all of the unnormalized weights c_1 = .",
    "now we can determine the normalized filter map as f(i , j ) = c_1 f(i , j ) .",
    "finally , we convolve the input temperature map with the filter map to obtain the filtered data map . if @xmath131 denotes the initial map , then the filtered map @xmath132 is given by fm(i , j ) = _ k , l = 1^n_f m(i - x , j - y ) f(k , l ) , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are determined from @xmath50 and @xmath55 as indicated below ( [ filter ] ) .",
    "boundary points require special treatment .",
    "we repeat the points at the boundary .",
    "the second part of the algorithm involves constructing the gradient maps .",
    "two arrays are created , the first containing the magnitude of the gradient at each pixel of the map , the second containing the information about the direction of the gradient .",
    "we compute the lattice derivatives by shifting the temperature map in each of the eight directions and looking for the maximal difference . instead of using the usual lattice gradient which is defined by ( x , y ) & = & + & + & , ( where the grid spacing is @xmath135 ) , we shall use the following as our definition of the magnitude of the gradient : g(x , y ) = max|g| and the direction is taken to be that for which the maximum value of @xmath136 occurs .",
    "@xmath137 is given by the discrete gradient g(x , y ) = , where @xmath138 denotes the neighboring point to @xmath139 and @xmath140 is the distance between @xmath138 and @xmath139 . for neighboring points not on the diagonal , the distance between the neighboring point and the point @xmath139 is 1 , for points along the diagonal the distance is @xmath141 .    the gradient of the image is then stored as an array with a dimension containing the two dimensional pixel array with the edge strengths and a dimension containing the two dimensional pixel array with the edge directions as the values .",
    "the next step is to find the pixels of the map which correspond to local maxima in the direction of the gradient .",
    "we first shift the map one unit forwards and backwards in each of the four directions ( along the coordinate axes and along the two diagonals , respectively ) . for each of these four shiftings",
    "we focus on points for which the absolute value of the gradient is greater than at the two neighboring points on either side . for all points",
    "selected , we check if the gradient is in the direction of the shifting .",
    "pixel points which pass this test are kept .",
    "the others are assigned a value of @xmath142 .",
    "boundary pixels are stripped from the list of local maxima since their magnitudes are influenced by boundary effects . in appendix",
    "a we discuss the local maxima doubling problem which the code has to deal with .",
    "as mentioned at the beginning of this section , our implementation of the canny algorithm makes use of three thresholds @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "their values are chosen to correspond to the amplitude of the ks effect of a single string since it is this effect which we want to identify .    thus , to set the thresholds for a given value of @xmath4 , we first run the code on a number of pure string simulations for that value of @xmath4 .",
    "we determine the maximal gradient ( amplitude ) @xmath146 for each simulation , and define the  string maximal gradient \" @xmath147 as the average of the individual maxima @xmath146 .",
    "returning to our list of candidate local maxima , then if the amplitude is larger than @xmath148 the point is discarded since it is not due to a typical string gradient . for amplitudes in the range",
    "t_u g_m < a t_c g_m then the pixel coordinates and gradient directions are stored in arrays . later on , the edge pixel map will be constructed by marking all pixel points in the above - mentioned coordinate array as @xmath126 .",
    "these are pixels for which the gradient is in the right range to be due to the ks effect from a cosmic string .",
    "pixels with a slightly lower gradient amplitude might still be due to the ks effect from a string with amplitude slightly reduced by noise .",
    "it is advantageous for the success of the canny algorithm to take into account this possibility .",
    "thus , if the amplitude of the local maxima is in the range t_l g_m < a t_u g_m then the coordinates and gradient directions of such pixels are stored in arrays corresponding to pixel points marked @xmath149 .",
    "arrays are created to store the indices of the points marked as @xmath126 and @xmath149 and separate arrays are created to store the directions of the corresponding indices .    the next step is the  edgefinder \" routine which decides whether grid points marked as @xmath149 belong to an edge or not . roughly speaking",
    ", points marked as @xmath149 are considered as belonging to an edge if they are direct or indirect neighbors to points labelled by @xmath126 and the gradients are in a similar direction .",
    "to specify the routine , there are three choices which can be made for this algorithm , as will emerge below .",
    "we start from a point labelled @xmath126 ( an option in the program is to start with a point labelled @xmath149 - the first of the three choices mentioned above ) . ] .",
    "the program then searches in all eight directions for a contiguous point labeled as @xmath149 or @xmath126 . for each direction",
    ", we check if it lies in the six directions ( or 2 directions ) perpendicular or near perpendicular ( or just perpendicular - the second of the choices mentioned above ) to the original point s gradient and check if the gradient is in the appropriate parallel or near parallel ( or just parallel - the third choice ) direction to that at the original @xmath126 ( or @xmath149 ) .",
    "if a point labeled as 1/2 is found , and the direction is in one of the allowed six ( or two ) , then we mark the coordinates of that point and repeat the search starting from that point .",
    "we stop if a @xmath126 is found , in which case we convert all of the @xmath149s found on the way to @xmath126 .",
    "if we do not find another point labelled @xmath149 , we stop and do not change the labelling of the points encountered on the way .",
    "then , we move on to the next point labelled by @xmath126 which has not already been covered by the search . in the variant of the code",
    "in which the search starts with points labelled by @xmath149 , we search for points labelled by @xmath149 or @xmath126 as described above , mark the coordinates of the points found , and continue until either a point marked @xmath126 is found ( in which case all of the @xmath149 found are converted to @xmath126 ) , or else no new point is found , in which case the @xmath149 are considered not to belong to a common edge and are not relabelled .",
    "the output of the  edge - finder \" routine is a list of coordinates of the pixels marked by @xmath126 and of the corresponding gradient directions .",
    "the result of the algorithm can be represented by two maps .",
    "the first is a map of pixel points originally labelled as @xmath126 and @xmath149 ( different shades ) , the second is an initial  edge pixel map \" , the map of the set of pixels labelled at the end of the  edgefinder \" routine by a @xmath126 .",
    "the final part of the canny algorithm is an ",
    "edge - counting \" routine ( this part of our method goes beyond the standard canny algorithm ) . this routine creates a second `` edge pixel map '' and a histogram of number of edges as a function of the edge length . starting with the first entry in the list of pixels marked by @xmath126 , the routine searches in directions perpendicular or near perpendicular ( or exactly perpendicular only ) to the gradient direction to find other pixels labelled as @xmath126 .",
    "if such a pixel is found , then the routine checks if the gradient direction of the new pixel is near parallel or parallel ( or exactly parallel only ) to the direction of the gradient at the initial pixel .",
    "if this is the case , the routine considers the new pixel as part of the edge it is following .",
    "once no further pixel is found , the routine considers the edge to have ended and saves the result .",
    "the program then moves to the next pixel labelled by @xmath126 .",
    "pixels are only allowed to be counted in one edge .",
    "after all edges are found , the lengths are tallied and can be made into a histogram . to take into account the fact that a pixel may be missing from a string edge due to a large influence of the gaussian component",
    ", there is an option for the  edge - counting \" routine to allow for a gap in an edge of a certain length .",

    "let us conclude this section by reminding the reader of the various parameters which have to be chosen and choices which have to be made in our canny algorithm implementation .",

    "there are the two choices analogous to the two choices mentioned at the end of the previous discussion .",
    "the user of the program has similar choices of `` perpendicular exactly or nearly perpendicular '' versus `` perpendicular exactly '' to the gradient for the directions to search and  parallel exactly or nearly parallel \" versus `` parallel exactly '' to make . finally , there is the number of points which the  edge - counting \" routine can skip .     and thresholds used in the analysis of an @xmath150 gaussian map with strings for @xmath151 .",

    "we tested the capability of our implementation of the canny algorithm to distinguish between temperature anisotropy maps which arise from a pure gaussian @xmath64cdm model and a model in which there is a contribution to the power spectrum coming from a scaling distribution of cosmic strings ( and with the power of the gaussian noise reduced to maintain the optimal fit to the cmb angular anisotropy power spectrum as described in section [ simuls ] ) .",
    "since we have applications to small - scale cmb anisotropy experiments in mind , we choose a simulation box of edge length @xmath157 and with angular resolution of @xmath158 .",
    "both in the @xmath64cdm model and in the cosmic string model , the actual universe is a realization of a random process .",

    "both the models and the canny algorithm contain a number of parameters . as described in section [ simuls ] , we chose the best fit parameters of a @xmath64cdm model .",
    "for the cosmic string distribution , we considered @xmath4 to be the free parameter of interest .",
    "we fixed the number of strings per hubble volume to be @xmath162 in some simulations and @xmath150 in other simulations , the string segment length to be @xmath76 with @xmath163 , and the velocity parameter @xmath92 .    in this work we did a rough optimization of the various parameters which have to be chosen in the canny algorithm .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath4 for which the effect of the strings is statistically significant we varied the parameters to find the parameter values which gave the best discriminatory power ( see below ) . on this basis , we chose the various thresholds . concerning the optimization of the  flags \" in the routine , it proved advantageous to start with the pixels marked @xmath126 in the edge finding algorithm , and to look in directions both perpendicular and near to perpendicular , and allowing the gradient at the neighboring point to be parallel or near to parallel in both the edge finding and the edge counting routines .",
    "we ran the canny algorithm on two different test maps to develop an intuition on how to optimize the flags . for both test maps ,",
    "more edges were found when the number of allowed directions and gradients were greater . in one test map",
    "more edges were found when the algorithm started with points marked as 1/2 and in the other algorithm more edges were found when the algorithm started with points marked as 1 for some values of the flags . since the algorithm is much slower when it starts with points marked as 1/2 , in this paper we always start with points marked as 1 .",
    "longer edges were found when skipping points was allowed .",
    "this is consistent with the findings we have for the averages of the full 50 maps of gaussian temperatures and the combined maps with strings .",
    "since skipping reduces the number of short edges , where the standard deviation is smaller compared to the mean , and thus increases the p - value , it increases the probability that the maps look the same . ]",
    "we ran simulations both with and without smoothing of the maps . in the runs with smoothing ,",
    "the smoothing was done in the final maps ( after adding the string maps to the gaussian maps ) . finally , we ran simulations allowing for skipping of points in the edge counting algorithm .",
    "discriminating power was quantified using the _ fisher combined probability test_. this test is applied to the two output histograms of edge lengths , one from the pure gaussian simulations , the other from the strings plus gaussian maps . for each length @xmath55",
    ", we are given the mean number of edges of that length and the corresponding standard deviation .",
    "given the two means and corresponding standard deviations we can apply the t - test to compute the probability @xmath164 that the two means come from the same distribution .",
    "the fisher combined probability method then computes a @xmath120 as follows ^2_2k = - 2 _ l = 1^k ln(p_l ) where @xmath50 is the number of edge lengths being considered , and computes the corresponding probability value from a @xmath120 distribution with @xmath165 values .",
    "we chose @xmath50 to be the last edgelength to have a nonzero standard deviation in either the string or gaussian distributions , whichever is smaller .",
    "the canny routine makes use of three thresholds . to find the cutoff or top threshold we ran a script to find the maximum average gradient of the fifty string maps and then compared the highest gradient to the highest average gradient .",
    "this threshold needs to increase as the @xmath4 decreases because otherwise one throws out virtually all of the edges , since as @xmath4 decreases @xmath147 decreases . one needs to keep some edges with values greater than the maximum gradient in any string map because the signal from the gaussian map may add in the same location to the signal from the string map . to find the upper and lower thresholds we ran the canny algorithm for various thresholds on a pure string map and determined by eye if enough strings could be seen but not so many that the overlap of the edges breaks apart the long string edges .",
    "in particular , for @xmath94 if the thresholds are too small the images are saturated with short edges which break up the long edges .",
    "thus , the thresholds need to be higher for @xmath94 than for @xmath162 .",
    "we leave a detailed optimization of the thresholds to future work .    as a test of the code , we ran the analysis algorithm on two independent sets of fifty gaussian cmb maps and computed the probability that the two sets come from the same gaussian ensemble .",
    "the resulting probability was typically of the order of @xmath166 , i.e. within the @xmath167 error range .",
    "our simulations show that maps originating from cosmic strings have a larger number of edges than the corresponding pure gaussian maps .",
    "this is a consequence of the presence of the kaiser - stebbins edges , the signal we are looking for .",
    "figure [ thist1 ] shows a comparison of the two histograms for the value @xmath168 .",
    "since the gaussian noise cuts up the long edges , the difference in edge lengths is statistically significant only for short edges .    .",
    "the number of edgelengths for strings plus gaussian maps are denoted by triangles and the squares denote the number of edgelengths for the pure gaussian maps .",
    "we plot the means and the standard deviation as the error .",

    "table 1 summarizes our results obtained by applying the fisher combined probability method to the histograms of string edge lengths .",

    "the statistical analysis includes edgelength 1 data .",
    "the first column gives the value of @xmath4 , the second the value of the top threshold ( the other two thresholds are held fixed at the values @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) , the third gives the probability that the histograms of the string and gaussian maps come from the same gaussian distribution .",
    "the fourth value gives the maximal edge length used in the analysis , and the last column lists the value of @xmath98 .",
    "we see that the cosmic string signal can be detected at a three sigma level down to a value @xmath172 which is almost two orders of magnitude better than the current bounds obtained by direct searches , and one order of magnitude better than the limits on @xmath4 coming from the cmb angular power spectrum constraints .",
    "these results are for unsmoothed maps .",
    "as can be expected from looking at the histograms of [ thist1 ] , the sensitivity of the algorithm decreases slightly if edges of length 1 are excluded from the analysis .",
    "the results excluding edges of length 1 are shown in table 2 .    since smoothing",
    "dramatically reduces the number of short edges , and since the strength of the signal of our analysis comes from the number of short edges , it turns out that smoothing significantly weakens the ability of the algorithm to pick out strings .",
    "the results of our analysis applied to smoothed maps ( smoothing length 3 ) are given in table 3 .",
    "the loss in discriminatory power is about a factor of 5 .",
    "this is a serious concern when considering applications of our algorithm to real data .    in table 4",
    "we present the results for @xmath162 .",
    "since there are an order of magnitude less string edges in this case , the limit on @xmath4 which can be obtained is slightly weaker ( about a factor of 3 weaker ) . to put this result into context",
    ", it is important to point out that limits on @xmath4 from other studies implicitly or explicitly use @xmath94 . the limits on @xmath4 from matching the angular cmb power spectrum would be weaker by about one order of magnitude .",
    "the results of the previous tables were obtained from an algorithm which did not have any skipping in the edge counting routine .",
    "we allowed skipping of two points .",
    "skipping of two points leads to a larger number of long edges .",
    "skipping by four points leads to edge broadening , an unwanted feature .",
    "hence , we only considered skipping two points . including",
    "skipping turns out to reduce the number of short edges more significantly than it increases the number of longer edges .",
    "thus , the power of our routine to discriminate between maps with and without strings slightly decreases when introducing skipping ( which is the opposite of what we initially expected ) .",
    "the results are indicated in the following table . however , it is possible that further optimization of the routine parameters would reverse the results concerning the effectiveness of skipping .",
    "table 1 : unsmoothed string map versus gaussian map n=10 + minimum edge length : 1 + @xmath153 , @xmath154 , num . skipped points=0 +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have developed a new program to search for cosmic strings in cmb anisotropy maps making use of the canny algorithm , and have tested it with simulated data corresponding to maps with specifications corresponding to those of current ground - based cmb experiments .",
    "the code contains a number of optimization parameters , and we have discussed the role of these parameters .    our results ( based on a rough optimization of the parameters ) show that our algorithm has the potential to improve the bounds on the cosmic string tension from direct cmb observations by up to two orders of magnitude compared to existing limits , and by one order of magnitude from other more indirect limits .",
    "the limiting value of @xmath121 decreases as @xmath173 ( the number of strings per hubble volume per hubble time ) increases . for cosmic superstrings",
    "the intercommutation probability may be much lower than for abelian field theory strings , thus leading to a larger value of @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "hence , our method may be able to set more stringent limits of the value of @xmath121 in the case of cosmic superstrings .",
    "a possible concern with our analysis is that our toy model of representing the effects of a string on the microwave sky introduces artificial edges .",
    "although the presence of the central edge in the cmb pattern of a string is clearly physical , the edges perpendicular to this central edge are due to the toy model which considers finite length string segments rather than a network of infinite strings .",
    "although the temperature perturbation clearly goes to zero at a perpendicular distance @xmath2 from a string present at time @xmath2 , the sharpness of the change given by @xcite may be modulated by interactions between the time of formation of the string network and the time @xmath2 .",
    "thus , one of our simulations with @xmath173 strings per hubble volume per hubble time may contain as many edges as a `` real '' string map with @xmath174 strings per hubble volume per hubble time . as can be seen by comparing tables 4 and 5",
    ", the dependence of the limits on @xmath4 on @xmath173 is not large .",
    "the limit on @xmath4 appears to scale as @xmath175 .",
    "thus , the limit on @xmath4 obtained from our analysis might be a factor of @xmath176 too optimistic due to the larger number of edges .",
    "this point could also be addressed by a canny algorithm analysis of more sophisticated string simulations , which we shall pursue as a follow - up study .",
    "the results presented here are based on comparing simulations with and without cosmic strings of a known value of @xmath4 . however , we do not know the value of @xmath4 , and the goal of observations is to determine the value or to set limits on it . hence , the way we plan to apply our algorithm to real data is to compare the edge histograms based on real data with those of a cosmic string plus gaussian map with fixed @xmath4 , and varying @xmath4 , starting from the current limit for this quantity .",
    "limits on @xmath4 can be obtained if the histogram derived from the data is statistically different from that of a gaussian plus strings map for the corresponding value of the normalized string tension .",
    "a candidate detection of cosmic strings would require the histogram derived from the real data to be statistically indistinguishable from that of a gaussian plus strings map , and at the same time different from that of a pure gaussian map .",
    "if there are indeed cosmic strings in the sky with a value of @xmath4 for which our analysis gives a probability @xmath177 that the histograms with and without strings are from the same distribution , then the probability that our statistical analysis would give a positive detection of these strings will be @xmath178 .    when applying the algorithm to real data , a serious concern is systematic errors introduced by the observing strategy - specifically lines in the maps due to the scanning strategy . in specific experiments such as the south pole telescope ( spt ) experiment , lines introduced by",
    "the scanning will be in one specific direction , and thus the algorithm can be rendered immune to this effect by considering only edges which are not parallel to the direction of the scanning stripes .",
    "foreground and instrumental noise are other important problems .",
    "smoothing of the maps is supposed to reduce the latter problem , and the study of @xcite confirms that instrumental noise such as that anticipated in the spt telescope will not have a big effect on the power of the algorithm .",
    "the next step of our research program will be to apply our code to existing data .",
    "the main challenge will be to take care of the systematic errors contained in the data .",
    "we plan to compare data for the actual sky map to gaussian and gaussian plus strings simulations . in order to put the data in a format for which a statistical analysis is possible",
    ", we will divide the sky maps into sub - maps of equal size , and treat each sub - map as a different realization of the sky .",
    "in other words , we make the ergodic hypothesis and identify ensemble and spatial averaging .",
    "thus , if we want to compare squares of edge length @xmath179 in the sky , then we need a total survey area @xmath159 times larger in order to be able to have @xmath159 independent data sets for the sky .",
    "we also plan to apply our code to more realistic cosmic string simulations , such as those of @xcite .",
    "this work is supported in part by a nserc discovery grant and by funds from the crc program .",

    "in this appendix we describe the maxima doubling problem which arises in our implementation of the canny algorithm .",
    "let us illustrate the problem in terms of an example .        and",
    "the points are labeled starting from 0 from left to right top to bottom , then the point at grid point 5 ( temperature 5 ) is a local maximum with gradient 7 along the 0 direction .",
    "the grid point 6 ( temperature 12 ) is a local maximum along the 1 direction with gradient 8 .",
    "there are nt any doubles in this case .",
    "then the grid point 5 ( temperature 5 ) is a local maximum along the 0 direction with a gradient of 7 and the grid point 6 ( temperature 12 ) is a local maximum along the 4 direction with gradient 7 .",
    "we use a sorting routine to remove the first occurrence of a gradient of 7 ( index 5 ) as we want there to be only one local maximum at this point .",
