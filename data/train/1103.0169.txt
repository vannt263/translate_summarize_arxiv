    "in the last few years , the idea of `` tipping points '' has caught the imagination in climate science with the possibility , also indicated by both palaeoclimate data and global climate models , that the climate system may abruptly `` tip '' from one regime to another in a comparatively short time .",
    "this recent interest in tipping points is related to a long - standing question in climate science : to understand whether climate fluctuations and transitions between different `` states '' are due to external causes ( such as variations in the insolation or orbital parameters of the earth ) or to internal mechanisms ( such as oceanic and atmospheric feedbacks acting on different timescales ) .",
    "a famous example is milankovich theory , according to which these transitions are forced by an external cause , namely the periodic variations in the earth s orbital parameters ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , the evidence in favour of milankovich theory still remains controversial , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "hasselmann @xcite was one of the first to tackle this question through simple climate models obtained as stochastically perturbed dynamical systems .",
    "he argued that the climate system can be conceptually divided into a fast component ( the `` weather '' , essentially corresponding to the evolution of the atmosphere ) and a slow component ( the `` climate '' , that is the ocean , cryosphere , land vegetation , etc . ) .",
    "the `` weather '' would act as an essentially random forcing exciting the response of the slow `` climate '' . in this way ,",
    "short - time scale phenomena , modelled as stochastic perturbations , can be thought of as driving long - term climate variations .",
    "this is what we refer to as _ noise - induced tipping_.    sutera  @xcite studies noise - induced tipping in a simple global energy balance model previously derived by fraedrich  @xcite .",
    "sutera s results indicate a characteristic time of @xmath0yr for the the random transitions between the `` warm '' and the `` cold '' climate states , which matches well with the observed average value .",
    "one shortcoming is that this analysis leaves open the question as to the _ periodicity _ of such transitions indicated by the power spectral analysis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig . 7 ) .",
    "there is a considerable literature on noise - induced escape from attractors in stochastic models @xcite .",
    "these have successfully been used for modelling changes in climate phenomena @xcite , although authors do not always use the word `` tipping '' and other aspects have been examined .",
    "for example , kondepudi _",
    "et al _ @xcite consider the combined effect of noise and parameter changes on the related problem of `` attractor selection '' in a noisy system .",
    "more recently , bifurcation - driven tipping points or _ dynamic bifurcations _ @xcite have been suggested as an important mechanism by which sudden changes in the behaviour of a system may come about .",
    "for example , lenton _",
    "@xcite conceptualize this as an open system @xmath1 where @xmath2 is in general a time - varying input . in the case",
    "that @xmath3 is constant , we refer to ( [ eq : xdot ] ) as the _ parametrized system _ with parameter @xmath3 , and to its stable solution as the _ quasi - static attractor_. if @xmath2 passes through a bifurcation point of the parametrized system where a quasi - static attractor ( such as an equilibrium point @xmath4 ) loses stability , it is intuitively clear that a system may `` tip '' directly as a result of varying that parameter , though in certain circumstances the effect may be delayed because of well - documented slow passage through bifurcation effects @xcite . related to this ,",
    "dakos et al @xcite have proposed that tipping points are recognizable and to some extent predictable .",
    "they propose a method to de - trend signals and then , examining the correlation of fluctuations in the detrended signal , they find a signature of bifurcation - induced tipping points .",
    "these papers have concentrated on systems where equilibrium solutions for the parametrised system lose stability , although recent work of kuehn @xcite considers tipping effects in general two timescale systems as occasions where there is a bifurcation of the fast dynamics .",
    "the explanation of climate tipping as a phenomenon purely induced by bifurcations has been called into question . for example ,",
    "ditlevsen and johnsen  @xcite suggest that the predictive techniques to forecast a forthcoming tipping point  @xcite are not always reliable . indeed , noise alone can drive a system to tipping without any bifurcation .",
    "nonetheless , it seems that the ideas of bifurcation - induced tipping can give practically useful predictions , for example in detecting potential ecosystem population collapses @xcite .    in their review paper , thompson and sieber",
    "@xcite discuss bifurcation- and noise - induced mechanisms for tipping .",
    "they examine stochastically forced systems @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents a brownian motion . using generic bifurcation theory , they distinguish between _ safe bifurcations _ ( where an attracting state loses stability but is replaced by another `` nearby '' attractor ) , _ explosive bifurcations _ ( where the attractor dynamics explores more of phase space but still returns to near the old attractor ) and _ dangerous bifurcations _ ( where the attractor dyamics after bifurcation are unrelated to what has gone before ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "thompson and sieber clarify that a timeseries analysis of bifurcation - induced tipping point near a quasi - static equilibrium ( qse ) relies on a separation of timescales @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the average drift rate of parameters , @xmath9 is the decay rate for the slowest decaying mode of the qse and @xmath10 are the remaining ( faster decaying ) modes .",
    "however , it is not easy to define @xmath8 in general ( especially in a coordinate - independent manner ) and there is no _ a priori _ reason for inequality ( [ eq : rates ] ) to hold for a given system .",
    "rate - dependent tipping has not previously been discussed in detail , but it has been identified in @xcite as an important tipping mechanism that can not be explained by previously proposed mechanisms ( _ i.e. _ noise or bifurcations of a quasi - static attractor ) .",
    "this paper aims to better understand the phenomenon of rate - dependent tipping by introducing a linear model with a _ tipping radius _ and discussing three basic examples where this type of tipping appears .",
    "we suggest that tipping effects in open systems can be usefully split into three categories :    * `` b - tipping '' where the output from an open system changes abruptly or qualitatively due to a bifurcation of a quasi - static attractor . *",
    "`` n - tipping '' where noisy fluctuations result in the system departing from a neighbourhood of a quasi - static attractor .",
    "* `` r - tipping '' where the system fails to track a continuously changing quasi - static attractor .",
    "we demonstrate that each mechanism _ on its own _ can produce a tipping response .",
    "furthermore , any open system may exhibit tipping phenomena that result from a combination of several of the above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; in the remainder of this section we discuss a setting for open systems allowing discussion of the three types of tipping phenomena . in section",
    "[ sec : r - tipping ] we formulate a criterion for r - tipping . in section",
    "[ sec : r - tipping - examples ] we discuss three illustrative low dimensional examples of r - tipping ; two related to bifurcation normal forms and one for a slow - fast system . section  [ sec : bnr - tipping_egs ] gives an illustrative examples of all three types of tipping for an energy - balance model of the global climate for different parameter regimes .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss ] concludes with a discussion and some open questions .",
    "dynamical systems theory has developed a wide - ranging corpus of results concentrated on the behaviour of autonomous finite dimensional deterministic systems - often called _ closed systems _ , because their future time trajectories depend only on the current state of the system .",
    "if the systems have inputs that can change the fate of system trajectories then we say the system is _",
    "open_. real - world systems are never closed except to some degree of approximation , and a range of methods have been developed to cope with the fact that they are open : ( a ) one can view external perturbations as time variation of parameters that would be fixed for a closed system .",
    "( b ) there are various theoretical approaches to stochasticity in systems , either intrinsic or external .",
    "( c ) control theory allows one to design inputs to control a system s outputs in a desired way , given ( possibly imperfect ) knowledge of the system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : blockdiagram](a ) we illustrate an arbitrary high dimensional system where we have identified a low dimensional subsystem that we wish to check for `` tipping effects '' .",
    "we do this by analysing the response of an open system ( [ eq : xdot ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : blockdiagram](b ) to possible time - varying inputs @xmath2 . fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] shows some possible candidates for the input @xmath2 ; we are interested in classifying those inputs that lead to a sudden change in @xmath11 .",
    "this `` tipping '' may depend on details of the noise ( n - tipping ) , may involve passing through a critical value of @xmath2 corresponding to a bifurcation ( b - tipping ) of the parametrized subsystem or may depend on the rate of change of @xmath2 along some path in parameter space ( r - tipping ) .",
    "we use a simple model to explore r - tipping and to give sufficient conditions such that r - tipping does / does not occur .",
    "suppose that the system ( [ eq : xdot ] ) for @xmath12 and parameter @xmath3 has a _ quasi - static equilibrium _",
    "( qse ) @xmath4 with a _ tipping radius _ @xmath13 . for some initial @xmath14 with @xmath15",
    "we assume that the evolution of @xmath11 with time is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a fixed stable linear operator ( i.e. @xmath18 as @xmath19 ) .",
    "more generally , we consider a time varying parameter , @xmath2 , that represents the input to the subsystem .",
    "if @xmath20 then we say that @xmath21 _ tracks _ ( or adiabatically follows ) the qse @xmath4 . if there is a @xmath22 such that @xmath23 then we say the solution _ tips _ ( adiabatic approximation fails ) at @xmath22 and regard the model as unphysical beyond this point in time",
    "the tipping radius may be related to the basin of attraction boundary for the nonlinear problem  ( [ eq : xdot ] ) , as is the case in sec .",
    "3(a , b ) , but it need not be , as is the case in sec .",
    "3(c ) and  @xcite . system ( [ eq : model ] ) shows only r - tipping - because @xmath17 is fixed there is no bifurcation in the system and no noise is present .",
    "clearly the model can be generalised to include @xmath17 and @xmath24 that vary with @xmath2 , and/or nonlinear terms . equation ( [ eq : model ] ) can be solved with initial condition @xmath25 to give @xmath26 if we assume that the solution is modelled by the linear system near the qse for an arbitrarily long past and set @xmath27 then the dependence on initial value decays to give @xmath28 assuming that @xmath17 is invertible and exponentially stable ( more precisely , we assume that @xmath29 as @xmath30 for @xmath31 ) and that the rate of motion of the qse and parameter are bounded ( more precisely , the derivatives @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 are bounded in time ) then ( [ eq : xt1 ] ) can be integrated by parts to give @xmath35_0^{\\infty } -\\int_0^{\\infty } e^{mu } \\frac{d\\tilde{x}}{dt}(\\lambda(t - u ) ) \\,du\\ ] ] and so @xmath36 integrating again by parts gives @xmath37 the linear instantaneous lag is @xmath38 if we define the _ drift _ of the qse to be the rate of change @xmath39 then the linear instantaneous lag is @xmath40 the error to the linear instantaneous lag is @xmath41 which includes historical information .",

    "if @xmath46 is constant in time then we say the system has _ steady drift _ and ( [ eq : xminustildex ] ) simplifies to @xmath47 .",
    "in other words , one can verify that @xmath48 and that @xmath49 on writing the matrix norm @xmath50 we note that for any @xmath51 and invertible @xmath17 we have @xmath52 we can avoid r - tipping if @xmath53 and hence a sufficient condition on the rate of parameter variation to avoid r - tipping is that @xmath54 while a sufficient condition for r - tipping to occur in this model is that @xmath55 in the intermediate case , the path of parameter variation will determine whether or not there is any r - tipping .      in the more general case where @xmath56 varies with @xmath57 we use ( [ eq : xminustildex ] ) and the inequality @xmath58 to give the upper bound @xmath59",
    "if we define @xmath60 then this means that @xmath61 moreover , if @xmath17 is stable then @xmath62 for some real @xmath63 ( see @xcite ) , and so @xmath64 hence , we can guarantee that ( [ eq : model ] ) avoids r - tipping by time @xmath57 if @xmath65 if @xmath17 is scalar then we can choose @xmath66 , @xmath67 and ( [ eq : avoids ] ) reduces to @xmath68 on the other hand , if @xmath17 is a matrix then we need a good choice of @xmath69 and @xmath70 in  ( [ eq : upperbound ] ) to make the tipping condition  ( [ eq : avoids ] ) optimal , but this depends on the matrix structure and not simply the norm ; see for example the text by hinrichsen and pritchard @xcite and the elegant estimates of godunov  ( * ? ?",
    "* eq.(13 ) ) .",
    "note that the tipping radius approach does not seem to easily give any sufficient condition to undergo r - tipping in terms of @xmath71 , comparable to sufficient condition for tipping with steady drift given the end of the previous section .",
    "one can define a natural timescale for the motion of the qse as @xmath72 note that in general , combinations of @xmath73 and @xmath74 do not give timescales in units s@xmath75 . for an r - tipping to occur",
    ", this natural timescale may be comparable to the slowest timescale ( e.g. the reciprocal of the leading eigenvalue of @xmath17 ) of the parametrized system .",
    "the three examples in the next section have @xmath76 and @xmath77 so we expect r - tipping when @xmath78 .",
    "however , if @xmath79 , then clearly we can have r - tipping even when @xmath80 .",
    "it is possible to think of more general tipping problems by analogy with the `` linear system and tipping radius '' model discussed here .",
    "for example , for an open nonlinear system we consider an `` effective tipping radius '' that corresponds to how far the linearized system needs to be from a branch of qse to ensure that the nonlinear system tips .",
    "there is however no exact analogy possible - the effective tipping radius may depend on the shape of the local basin of attraction , the nonlinearities present and the exact path taken in parameter space .",
    "we give three illustrative examples of r - tipping .",
    "the first two are based on normal forms for the two basic codimension one bifurcation that are generic for dissipative systems : the saddle - node and the hopf bifurcation .",
    "the third is an example that uses a fast - slow system to show that r - tipping can occur even in cases where there is a single attractor that is globally asymptotically stable .",

    "we present a simple climate model that independently show , under differing circumstances , all three types of tipping . in its deterministic version , this is a `` zero dimensional '' global energy balance model originally introduced by fraedrich  @xcite : @xmath226 the state variable @xmath227 represents an average surface temperature of an ocean on a spherical planet subject to radiative heating .",

    "it is of great practical importance to understand the theoretical mechanisms behind tipping phenomena in the climate system as well as other systems .",
    "we have proposed here that such mechanisms can be effectively divided into three distinct categories : bifurcation - induced , noise - induced and rate - dependent tipping , respectively denoted as b- , n- and r - tipping . in particular , we describe r - tipping , a mechanism that may be exhibited by ( sub - systems of ) the climate system independently of the presence or absence of the other types of tipping .    in realistic models , tipping effects may be associated with a combination of the three mechanisms , and it will be a challenge to understand this more general case . for example b - tipping , usually associated with slow changes in a parameter , may turn into r - tipping upon increasing the rate of change for the parameters . however , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] , completely new mechanisms may appear on increasing the rate , including the possibility that b - tipping may be suppressed for fast enough variation of parameters .",
    "alternatively , the b - tipping may persist but an r - tipping mechanism may come into play before the b - tipping is reached .",
    "we emphasise that neither n - tipping and r - tipping require any change of stability .",
    "hence there is no reason to assume that the techniques of  @xcite , based on a de - trended autoregressive model for b - tipping , should deliver useful predictions in such cases - as noted by  @xcite , n - tipping is intrinsically unpredictable .",
    "we are investigating whether any novel predictive technique may be developed for r - tipping .",
    "those cases of r - tipping that can be reduced to a local bifurcation in a co - moving system may be expected to be predictable using similar methods ; this includes the examples in sec .",
    "3(a),(b)(i ) with steady drift . in more complex cases",
    ", @xmath165 may still be quantifiable by global heteroclinic bifurcations for an extended system , for example ( [ eq : nf2 ] ) and ( [ eq : shift ] ) or ( [ eq : hopf ] ) and ( [ eq : shift ] ) in sec .",
    "3(b)(ii ) .",
    "the classification proposed here may be applicable to a wide range of open systems under the influence of noise and/or parameter changes .",
    "recent work of nene and zaikin @xcite suggests there may be interesting applications of rate - dependent bifurcation theory to determine cell fate .",
    "there are potentially many other application areas , from mechanics and ecology to economics and social sciences where tipping points are of interest .",
    "we suggest that this will be an area of significant mathematical development in the coming years .",
