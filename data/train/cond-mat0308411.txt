    "the transport , optical , and spin properties of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a high magnetic field have been intensively studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite over more than a decade .",
    "some of these studies have demonstrated that a common scenario of the formation of what can generally be called an excitonic complex occurs in various seemingly different physical situations .",
    "the excitonic complexes , consisting of a small number of appropriate elementary charged excitations ( positively and negatively charged quasiparticles of various type depending on a particular form of the electron ",
    "electron correlations in the underlying 2deg ) , can often be considered as nearly free particles with well defined single - particle properties .",
    "these properties , such as electric charge , characteristic size , longitudinal or angular momentum , spin , binding energy , or oscillator strength for a particular type of quasiparticle  antiquasiparticle recombination process , determine the response of the 2deg to the experimental perturbation .",
    "in particular , being weakly coupled to one another or to the electrons , excitonic complexes recombine obeying simple selection rules that result from their geometric ( 2d translational ) or dynamical ( particle  hole ) symmetries .",
    "these simple symmetries often persist under experimental conditions despite complicated electron  electron correlations or such typical symmetry - breaking mechanisms as disorder or collisions , and greatly simplify the measured response of the entire system .",
    "sometimes , such simplification is even undesirable as it can make the experiment sensitive only to the simple properties of the excitonic complexes , and quite insensitive to the specific properties of the underlying 2deg .",
    "for example , it has long been predicted that the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum in an infinitely high magnetic field contains no information about the electron  electron correlations ( e.g. , the presence or charge of laughlin quasiparticles in the fractional quantum hall regime ) regardless of possible disorder @xcite .",
    "instead , the spectrum is reduced to a single discrete transition corresponding to the recombination of a neutral exciton in the zero momentum ground state , and either decreasing the magnetic field in order to allow interactions to admix higher landau levels ( ll s ) or applying an electric field to spatially separate electrons and holes is needed for pl to become a useful tool for studying electron  electron interactions .",
    "another example is related to a prediction @xcite that the most strongly bound complex involving conduction electrons ( @xmath0 ) and a valence hole ( @xmath1 ) in very high magnetic fields is a triplet state of the charged exciton ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this state is nonradiative because of both geometrical and dynamical symmetry , and has not been experimentally confirmed in earlier experiments in high magnetic fields @xcite , but only quite recently @xcite , when special measures were taken to detect its weak pl signal .",
    "while breaking of the dynamical , particle  hole symmetry in a finite magnetic field is by no means surprising , the fact that collisions of an @xmath3 with the surrounding electrons do not relax the geometrical selection rule associated with the angular momentum conservation is a nice demonstration of laughlin correlations of the @xmath3 with other negative charges @xcite . as a result of these correlations , at small values of the filling factor @xmath4 ,",
    "the @xmath3 s remain spatially isolated and avoid high energy collisions with one other or with electrons to become true quasiparticles of a 2deg containing additional valence holes @xcite .    in the following sections of this article we will review a few examples of excitonic complexes that form in electronic quantum hall systems : interband excitonic complexes in sec .",
