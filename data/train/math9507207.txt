    "the deformation theory of non - orientable surfaces deals with the problem of studying parameter spaces for the different dianalytic structures that a surface can have .",

    "this uniformization result allows us to give explicit examples of teichmller spaces of non - orientable surfaces , as subsets of deformation spaces of orientable surfaces .",
