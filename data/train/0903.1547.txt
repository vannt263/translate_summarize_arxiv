    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is widely believed to be the theory of strong interactions . in this non abelian theory , the gauge bosons , the gluons , carry a color charge .",
    "we are therefore led to observable color singlet configurations made of quarks but also gluons .",
    "glueballs , bound states of only gluons , and hybrid mesons are consequences and predictions of qcd . besides glueballs ,",
    "hybrid mesons deserve much interest .",
    "the gluonic excitation leads to low - lying states with quantum numbers not allowed for usual mesons ( note that the low - lying gluon states are non exotic but glueballs with exotic quantum number also exits and are called oddballs , for a review see ref .",
    "their observation would be another great confirmation of qcd .",
    "however , the detection of exotic hadrons remains a challenging task ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the properties of hybrid mesons were investigated in various approaches , see for examples ref .",
    "@xcite , and in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "the former have two common interpretations . in the first one ,",
    "the flux tube linking the quark to the antiquark is in an excited state , allowing quantum numbers that can not be reached by the usual quark - antiquark picture . in the other scenario",
    ", the excitation is modelled by a constituent gluon , leading to a three - body system .",
    "we know that both picture are closely linked : the constituent gluon creates an equivalent potential compatible with the energy of an excited string @xcite .",
    "all these approaches rely on quasiparticle interpretation . for heavy particles ,",
    "the spectrum and decay properties are extracted from a hamiltonian formalism .",
    "one has then to resort to a numerical procedure to find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . for two - body systems , like heavy charmonia , different methods exist .",
    "the most efficient one is the so called lagrange mesh method .",
    "this technique allows one to compute energies and wave functions straightforwardly since the method is not variational  @xcite .",
    "matrix elements for semi - relativistic kinetic energy are easily computed .",
    "however , it does not admit a three - body generalization in the semi - relativistic case . for three - body systems , like hybrid mesons ,",
    "one generally computes the mass within a finite dimensional basis .",
    "we expand the unknown wave function on a set of trial functions forming a basis of the hilbert space in the limit where the dimension of the basis goes to infinity .    in practice",
    ", we only deal with a finite number of basis functions .",
    "fortunately , we know the approximation of the mass to be always an upper of the true eigenvalue , allowing to minimize the mass with respect to parameters @xcite .",
    "the question is then : how many basis functions should we consider to have an acceptable accuracy ? in this work , we answer to this question for the three - body description of hybrid mesons .",
    "recently , kalashnikova and nefediev investigated the spectrum of the charmonium hybrid @xmath1 within the constituent gluon model @xcite .",
    "they derived a hamiltonian thanks to the field correlator method and introduced einbein ( or auxiliary ) fields to deal with relativistic kinematics .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian was diagonalized with one trial function that was taken as a gaussian depending of a hyperradius . finally , the authors computed correction coming from the string , self - energy and spin - dependent operators .",
    "the authors studied the case of the lowest @xmath2 hybrid meson in with the gluon quantum numbers are @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( magnetic gluon ) . in this work ,",
    "we investigate how accurate are those approximations for the wave function ( truncation of the basis ) and for the hamiltonian ( introduction of auxiliary fields ) and greatly improve the accuracy on the mass thanks to correlated gaussian functions .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : def ] , we present the model of ref.@xcite and recall its main properties . the authors used a particular ansatz for the wave wave function which is described in sec .",

    "[ sec : gauss ] . in this section , which consist in the main part of this work",

    "having identified a good approximation for the wave function , we test in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : conclu ]",
    "the starting point for the hybrid model of @xcite is a hamiltonian derived from qcd thanks to the field correlator method . for a hybrid meson seen as a @xmath6 system , this hamiltonian reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 the first terms of @xmath10 represent the kinetic energy of two quarks of the same mass and of the massless constituent gluon .",
    "the long - range confining force consists in two strings , two fundamental flux tubes of energy density @xmath11 , linking the gluon to the quarks .",
    "such a confining potential is in agreement with other phenomenological approaches  @xcite as well as with recent lattice qcd computations  @xcite . for other three - body systems like baryons ,",
    "the confinement is generally assumed to be a y - shape . in the case of the hybrid , however , under casimir scaling hypothesis for the string tension , the v - configuration is resolved to be energetically favorable @xcite .",
    "the torricelli point of the y - shape merges with the gluon position . imposing a y - shape would obviously raise the whole spectrum .",
    "the casimir scaling hypothesis is supported by recent lattice studies , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the confining potential is augmented by the short - range coulomb potential @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the strong coupling constant , arising from one gluon exchange effects between the constituent particles .",
    "in particular , the coulomb potential between the quark and the antiquark is repulsive since the @xmath14 pair is in a color octet .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion about the short - range interaction potentials in qcd .",
    "spin - dependent short - range interactions could be added in perturbation as it is done in ref .",
    "however , it is enough for our purpose to consider only the dominant order hamiltonian  ( [ eq : mainh ] ) .    to be complete",
    ", we recall that the parity and charge conjugation of a @xmath6 system are given respectively by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the orbital angular momenta of the @xmath14 pair and of the gluon , and where @xmath18 is the intrinsic spin of the @xmath14 pair .",
    "compared to usual mesons , extra phases give rise to exotic quantum numbers such as @xmath19 for example .",
    "two cases have to be distinguished following the total spin @xmath20 of the gluon : the magnetic gluon , for which @xmath21 , and the electric gluon for which @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "although it may gain a dynamical mass induced by confinig forces , the gluon is a massless particle that remains transverse , with only two polarisations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the minimal value for @xmath20 is 1 .",
    "exotic quantum numbers require at least one @xmath23-wave . in the following",
    ", we shall refer to magnetic ( electric ) , the @xmath6 states with @xmath3 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "solving the eigenequation associated to a three - body semirelativistic hamiltonian such as  ( [ eq : mainh ] ) is a difficult numerical problem .",
    "the intrinsic complexity of three - body systems obviously comes into play , but another problem is the determination of the matrix elements for kinetic operators of the form @xmath25 , which are not commonly found in quantum mechanics .",
    "this last difficulty can be avoided by introducing auxiliary ( or einbein ) fields to get rid of the square roots appearing in hamiltonian  ( [ eq : mainh ] ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the so - called auxiliary fields .",
    "being formally defined as operators , they can be eliminated through the following equations @xmath30 it is then readily checked that @xmath31 ; both hamiltonians are equivalent up to the elimination of the auxiliary fields as operators . however , the calculations are considerably simplified if one considers them are c - numbers variational parameters .",
    "the eigenvalues of the spinless hamiltonian are more easily found since only nonrelativistic kinetic operators are present .",
    "these eigenvalues , denoted as @xmath32 , are finally minimized with respect to the einbeins .",
    "the optimal values of the auxiliary fields seen as variational parameters are logically close to the average values of the corresponding operators  @xcite .",
    "for example , the optimal value of @xmath29 , denoted as @xmath33 , is such that @xmath34 .",
    "it can be interpreted as a dynamical gluon mass .",
    "the same arguments hold for the other auxiliary fields .",
    "an important point , that has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the eigenvalues of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : mainh_af ] ) are upper bounds of the eigenvalues of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : mainh ] ) .",
    "the more auxiliary fields are introduced , the less this bound is accurate . in particular , the accuracy of the auxiliary field method decreases when light or massless particles are present in the system under study .    in this work we focus on the case where the quark and the antiquark have the same mass , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath35 .",
    "then , by symmetry , @xmath36 and , using the jacobi coordinates @xmath37 hamiltonian  ( [ eq : mainh_af ] ) becomes @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the momenta associated to @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively , and where @xmath43 the center of mass , defined as @xmath44 is decoupled and its conjugate momentum is set equal to zero since we work in the rest frame of the system .",
    "eigenvalues of hamiltonian @xmath45 with auxiliary fields  ( [ af3 ] ) in the case of @xmath46 systems have been numerically computed in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the hyperspherical formalism .",
    "we recall in this section the procedure that has been used in this last reference .",
    "the authors of @xcite state that since the @xmath14 pair is heavy , the assumption @xmath47 can be made . moreover ,",
    "the particular case of a magnetic gluon with @xmath3 is considered in this reference . for this particular choice",
    ", the spin of the quark pair @xmath18 is a good quantum number and leads to the following states : @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "all these states are degenerate since @xmath45 does not have any spin - dependent term .",
    "this leads to wave functions of the form @xmath52^j,\\ ] ] with the hyperradius @xmath53 @xmath54 is a shorthand notation for the coupling @xmath55^\\ell$ ] , with the solid spherical harmonics @xmath56 .",
    "the following states can consequently be described within this approach @xmath57 ^ 1\\\\ \\left|j^{-+}\\right\\rangle&=&\\left|\\chi(\\bm x ) \\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left[\\left|0,1\\right\\rangle^1\\otimes \\left|1\\right\\rangle\\right]^{j},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath58 .",
    "the trial wave function is chosen to be a gaussian depending on one variational parameter @xmath59 , _",

    "the spin function for the quark pair is irrelevant since our hamiltonian is spin - independent .",
    "we will therefore get the same mass for the the four states @xmath64 under consideration .",
    "a convenient method to fit the parameters is to reproduce the charmonium spectrum within the same flux tube model , that is with the hamiltonian @xmath65 .",
    "the parameters obtained in this way are compatible with typical values used in potential models  @xcite : @xmath66 we , as the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , then implicitly assumed the same value for the parameters for both systems ( charmonium and hybrid charmonium ) .",
    "it is also natural to keep the same parameters as in ref .",
    "@xcite since the present paper focuses on the improvement of the numerical resolution . in sec .",
    "[ sec : param ] we vary the parameters and investigate this influence of the one gaussian approximation .    a numerical resolution of @xmath45 with the ansatz leads to  @xcite @xmath67 for the ground state .",
    "this mass corresponds in a first approximation to @xmath68 hybrid mesons with quantum numbers @xmath48 and @xmath50 .",
    "spin - dependent corrections have also been computed to be equal to  @xcite    [ splittings ] @xmath69    the splittings induced by the spin - dependent operators in perturbation theory are clearly not negligible .",
    "however , we know from the rayleigh - ritz method @xcite that the mass @xmath70 gev can only be an upper bound of the true eigenvalue of @xmath45 . indeed , when truncating the basis with a finite number of basis function , one restrict the operator to the subspace spanned by the trial functions .",
    "it is then natural to investigate how far is @xmath71 from the true eigenvalue and compare the difference with respect to the additional corrections .",
    "the real eigenvalue @xmath72 of a schrdinger equation @xmath73 is generally found by expanding the wave function @xmath74 in a basis @xmath75 the real eigenvalue is reached in the limit @xmath76 . since for fixed @xmath77 , @xmath78 is an upper bound , we can then minimize the mass with respect to the parameters on which depend @xmath79 . a appropriate ansatz for @xmath79 will lead to an accurate mass for low values of @xmath77 .    for the trial functions",
    ", we use a generalisation of the hyperspherical function @xmath80 the wave function used in @xcite is recovered for the particular values @xmath81 , @xmath82 and the condition on the variational parameters @xmath83 et @xmath84 .",
    "the correlated gaussian shared many advantages @xcite .",
    "they admit a generalisation for an arbitrary number of interacting particles thanks to matrix notation ; matrix elements for usual power laws potential are expressed in close forms ; the fourier transform of a gaussian is also a gaussian . in particular , we have shown that matrix elements for semirelativistic kinematics @xmath25 can be easily derived @xcite .",
    "this form is very convenient for hybrid mesons since we deal easily with angular excitations for the gluon but also for the quarks .",
    "imposing some restriction on the parameters we get two ansatz for the lowest @xmath23-wave hybrid mesons @xmath85 the function @xmath86 has the angular part @xmath87 and correspond to a hybrid meson with a magnetic gluon , and the function @xmath88 has the angular behavior @xmath89 and corresponds to a hybrid meson with an electric gluon .",
    "let us now see how changes the mass when relaxing the condition on @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in order to have a relevant comparison point",
    ", we consider @xmath45 with the parameters given in and .",
    "if we use the hyperspherical formalism with only one trial function ( and hence only one variational parameter ) in our basis , we find a mass of @xmath90 gev ( obviously the same value as in ref .",
    "the optimisation procedure leads to @xmath91 gev@xmath92 which correspond to @xmath93 gev and @xmath94 gev .",
    "the relation with the parameters implies a nearly symmetric gaussian shape , _",
    "i.e _ @xmath95 here we perform a numerical optimisation on the two parameters of our single wave function @xmath86 . we expect to find a mass slightly lower than in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the resulting mass for the four states @xmath64 in this approximation reads @xmath96 we gain 109 mev by simply choosing a more general ansatz ( with two variational parameters instead of one parameter ) for the trial wave function .",
    "the shift is of order of the spin - splittings .",
    "let us look at the wave in order to understand this difference .",
    "the optimisation procedure leads to @xmath97 gev and @xmath98 gev .",
    "their ratio strongly differs from . as an illustration",

    "the mass of the hybrid with an electric gluon is resolved to be lighter than the magnetic one .",
    "our simple hamiltonian mixes the two states and the mass of the lightest states has clearly a bigger electric component .",
    "however , the decay modes of these two states are different .",
    "an electric gluon allows the hybrid to decay into a s - wave @xmath102 .",
    "this may induce difficulty to single out a hybrid interpretation with respect to conventional charmonium .",
    "i would be interesting to investigate more deeply the decay properties of those states which could guide experimentalist in the search for hybrid charmonia .",
    "the previous sections emphasized on the fact that various approximations may lead to overestimation of hybrid masses .",
    "however , the single gaussian approximation was resolved to be an acceptable approximation .",
    "we now turn our attention to this specific approximation and test its evolution for different values of the parameters for the semi - relativistic hamiltonian  .",
    "we then change one parameter and keep the others to their `` optimal '' values .",
    "the results are displayed in figs  [ fig : mass_evo ] and [ fig : sigma_evo ] for respectively the evolution of the gluon mass and the string tension .",
    "varying the gluon mass is interesting since effective approaches used a non - vanishing value for the gluon mass in the kinetic energy , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite . for wide ranges of the parameters ,",
    "the single gaussian approximation is resolved always to give an overestimation of @xmath103 mev constant in the intervals . for a wide range of variation of @xmath104 , the single gaussian approximation lie around 20 - 50 mev above the true mass . for hybrid meson systems , the approximative wave function is then robust under parameter evolution .",
    "we checked that we obtain similar results for electric gluon wave functions .",
    "during the main part of this paper , we were concerned by kalashnikova and nefediev s model @xcite in which the starting point was hamiltonian .",
    "this model shares the constituent model s typical features .",
    "the kinetic energy is the semi - relativistic expression valid for massless particles ( the constituent gluon ) . a linear ( in fact a v - junction ) plus coulomb term is used for the potential .",
    "the parameters ( charm quark mass , string tension and strong coupling ) were determined on a similar model for charmonium .",
    "the parameters reproduce a quarkonium spectrum in agreement with experimental data and are expected to predict an acceptable value for hybrid masses .",
    "however , solving a three - body systems may require hypothesis : on one side in the hamiltonian by introducing auxiliary fields to get of rid of square roots ; on the other side on the wave function by imposing particular values for internal quantum numbers and/or restricting the space spanned by the wave function to a restricted subspace of the total hilbert space .",
    "we demonstrated in this work that one should be very careful with the approximations made to solve the eigenvalue problems numerically .",
    "indeed , auxiliary fields , hyperspherical formalism with only one function , fock space reduction ( magnetic / electric gluons ) may causes an overestimation of the mass by amount of 100 - 600 mev .",
    "however , in each cases of study ( magnetic or electric gluon ) , the less worst approximation was the only gaussian function .",
    "for the same hamiltonian , the single gaussian overestimated the mass by only @xmath105 mev where the hyperspherical formalism with only one function gave always a discrepancy around @xmath106 mev .    in their conclusion",
    ", the authors of @xcite pointed out a numerical vector hybrid meson mass of 4.397 gev , substantially higher than the experimental candidate @xmath0 .",
    "the improvements of the numerical method developed in the present paper clearly favor the hybrid meson interpretation of the candidate .",
    "indeed , the real eigenvalue of the hamiltonian used in @xcite is 130 mev below the approximation with the hyperspherical formalism , the exact discrepancy with the vector x(4260 ) .",
    "we stressed , nevertheless , that the correction to the bare mass were computed with the approximative wave function and should slightly differ .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate how strong is the difference .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the mass remains more or less stable under the approximations considered in this paper but we think that the decays properties , depending strongly of the wave functions , should change more that the mass .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the two other vector states y(4325 ) from babar  @xcite and y(4360 ) from belle  @xcite .",
    "their mass lie close to the x(4260 ) and mixing may cause a mass shift with respect to pure @xmath2 hybrid states . however , the purpose of this paper was the investigation of the numerical procedure for a simple hamiltonian for pure @xmath2 .",
    "a detail investigation of the possible mixing with other states would require a more complicated description of the system and is beyond this study .",
