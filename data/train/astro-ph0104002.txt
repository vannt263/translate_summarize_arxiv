    "in the currently favored paradigm for the formation of structure in the universe , luminous objects such as galaxies and galaxy clusters are embedded within extended halos of cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the non - linear equilibrium structure of these halos has long been thought to contain clues as to the astrophysical nature of dark matter , a fact that has fueled strong interest in detailed theoretical predictions for the structure of dark matter halos , as well as in constraints placed by observations of disk galaxy rotation curves ( frenk 1988 ; flores 1993 ; flores & primack 1994 ; moore 1994 ; moore 1999b , mcgaugh & de blok 1998 , van den bosch 2000 ; swaters , madore & trewhella 2000 ; van den bosch & swaters 2000 ) , by gravitational lensing of galaxies and clusters ( see , e.g. , tyson , kochanski & dellantonio 1998 , williams , navarro & bartelmann 1999 ) , and by detailed studies of the stellar dynamics of spheroidal galaxies ( carollo 1995 ; rix 1997 ; gerhard 1998 ; cretton 2000 ; kronawitter 2000 ) .    unfortunately , observational constraints tend to be strongest near the center of dark matter halos  where most of the luminous material in galaxies resides  but also where theoretical predictions are least robust .",
    "this is because of the difficulties inherent to simulating accurately through n - body methods regions where overdensities exceed @xmath12 and where particles may have completed thousands of orbits during a hubble time . in spite of these difficulties , there has been steady progress in our theoretical understanding of the non - linear structure of virialized dark matter halos , driven largely by direct numerical simulation .",
    "following on pioneering numerical studies by quinn , salmon & zurek ( 1986 ) , frenk ( 1988 ) , dubinski & carlberg ( 1991 ) , and crone , evrard & richstone ( 1994 ) , navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw ) found that , regardless of mass and of the value of the cosmological parameters , the density profiles of dark matter halos formed in various hierarchical clustering cosmogonies were strikingly similar .",
    "this `` universal '' structure can be characterized by a spherically - averaged density profile which differs substantially from the simple power - laws , @xmath13 , predicted by early theoretical studies ( gunn & gott 1972 , fillmore & goldreich 1984 , hoffmann & shaham 1985 , white & zaritsky 1992 ) .",
    "the profile steepens monotonically with radius , with logarithmic slopes shallower than isothermal ( i.e. @xmath14 ) near the center , but steeper than isothermal ( @xmath15 ) near the virial radius of the system .",
    "the nfw result has been confirmed by a number of subsequent studies ( cole & lacey 1996 , huss , jain & steinmetz 1999 , fukushige & makino 1997 , moore 1998 , jing & suto 2000 ) , although there is some disagreement amongst authors regarding the innermost value of the logarithmic slope .",
    "nfw argued that a fitting formula where @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the radius in units of a suitably defined `` scale radius '' @xmath18 ) provides a very good fit to the density profiles of simulated halos over two decades in radius .",
    "moore ( 1998 ) , ghigna ( 2000 ) , and fukushige & makino ( 2000 ) have argued that @xmath19 converges to a value of @xmath20 near the center , rather than the @xmath21 expected from the nfw fit .",
    "kravtsov ( 1998 ) initially obtained much shallower inner slopes ( @xmath22 ) in their numerical simulations , but have now revised their conclusions ; these authors now argue that cdm halos have steeply divergent density profiles but , depending on evolutionary details , the slope of a galaxy - sized halo at the innermost resolved radius may very between @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( klypin 2000 )",
    ".    steep inner slopes have been traditionally disfavored by rotation curve data , a fact that has often been used to `` rule out '' cdm as a viable cosmogony ( flores & primack 1994 , moore 1994 , mcgaugh & de blok 1998 , blais - ouellette 2001 , ct 2000 , de blok 2001 ) .",
    "however , recent reanalysis of the available data suggests that most rotation curves are broadly consistent with `` cuspy '' dark matter cores , provided that the innermost slope is shallower than @xmath25 and that the `` concentration '' of the halos is low ( navarro 1998 , van den bosch 2000 , van den bosch & swaters 2000 ) .",
    "although there may not be at present broad consensus regarding how steep the innermost slope is , or even whether there should be a well - defined asymptotic innermost slope , there is agreement that it will take extraordinary computational effort to reach a robust resolution of the controversy .",
    "what is required is a statistically significant sample of galaxy - sized halos with sub - kpc resolution , an extremely onerous computational task that will stretch the capabilities of the most powerful massively parallel computers .",
    "steps in this direction are currently being taken ( e.g. , power et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , but it will take some time until these efforts yield conclusive results .    from the theoretical point of view , a number of plausible arguments",
    "have been advanced in order to try and explain the innermost behaviour of dark matter density profiles from stellar dynamical principles .",
    "these efforts , however , tend to give non - unique results and have so far been unable to explain the remarkable similarity in the structure of dark matter halos of widely different mass formed in a variety of cosmogonies ( evans & collett 1997 , syer & white 1998 , nusser & sheth 1999 , okas & hoffman 2000 ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate an empirical alternative to analytic efforts addressed at estimating the innermost slope of the density profile .",
    "our proposal exploits the similarity between the phase - space density profiles of cdm halos and that of the self - similar solution for spherical collapse in an expanding universe found by bertschinger ( 1985 ) .",
    "in addition , this offers an attractive scenario for understanding the shape of halo density profiles as well as a powerful tool for estimating their slope near the center .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 , we present the phase - space density profiles for galaxy - sized cdm halos in several recent simulations , and show that they are well approximated , for over two decades in radius , by a power law . in section 3 , we investigate equilibrium density profiles consistent with this constraint by solving the jeans equation for spherically symmetric systems with isotropic velocity dispersion tensors .",
    "section 4 compares these results with the results of numerical simulations .",
    "we discuss and summarize our findings in section 5 .",
    "we have chosen for our analysis three high - resolution simulations of galaxy - sized cdm halos identified at @xmath26 .",
    "each of these simulations has of order @xmath27 particles within the virial radius of the halo , and was run with pkdgrav , a massively - parallel n - body code developed by joachim stadel and thomas quinn at the university of washington .",
    "these simulations are amongst the largest carried out so far for galaxy - sized objects , and represent a major investment in computational resources .",
    "two of the halos were run in the former `` standard '' cdm cosmology ( scdm , @xmath28 ) and have circular velocities of @xmath29 and @xmath30 km s@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "these circular velocities are measured at the `` virial '' radius , @xmath32 , where the mean inner density of the system is @xmath33 times the critical value for closure .",
    "these two halos are part of the `` local group '' simulation reported in moore ( 1999a ) .",
    "the third halo has a circular velocity of @xmath33 km s@xmath31 and was run in the currently popular lcdm cosmogony ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "gravitational softenings were chosen to be @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for the scdm and lcdm runs , respectively .",
    "pkdgrav uses a multi - stepping algorithm to integrate the equations of motion ; particles with the smallest time bins may take up to @xmath37 timesteps to evolve from the initial redshift ( @xmath38 for scdm and @xmath39 for lcdm ) to the present .",
    "the initial conditions for the scdm runs were setup using the algorithms devised by the n - body shop at the university of washington .",
    "those for the lcdm run were set up in a completely independent way using the algorithms described by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , 1997 ; see also efstathiou 1985 ) . as we describe below",
    ", the results of these two independent runs are consistent with each other , which suggests that our conclusions are independent of both the cosmological model adopted and of the particular choice of initial conditions setup algorithms .",
    "figure 1 shows the spherically - averaged phase - space density profile of the three cdm halos .",
    "solid ( dashed ) lines are used for the scdm ( lcdm ) halos .",
    "the phase - space density is computed in spherical bins containing @xmath40 particles each and is defined as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the mass density and @xmath43 is the 1-d velocity dispersion in the bin . for ease of comparison , we have chosen to normalize @xmath41 so that all three curves coincide at @xmath44 .",
    "the important point illustrated by this figure is that , over more than two decades in radius , the phase - space density profile is very well approximated by a power law of slope @xmath45 ( thin straight line ) .",
    "this is quite remarkable , given that both the density profiles ( shown in figure 2 ) and the velocity dispersion profiles of these halos deviate quite strongly from simple power laws , as described by nfw .",
    "also remarkable is that the slope of this power - law coincides with the self - similar solution derived by bertschinger ( 1985 ) for secondary infall onto a spherical perturbation in an unperturbed einstein - de sitter universe : bertschinger s solution is plotted with solid circles in figure 1 .",
    "this solution corresponds to the self - similar equilibrium configuration of a @xmath46 gas formed by spherical accretion onto a point - mass perturber in an otherwise uniform einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "the quantity shown by the solid circles is the quantity `` equivalent '' to the phase - space density , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the local ( isotropic ) pressure . as discussed by bertschinger",
    ", this solution is the most appropriate to compare with our numerical results for cdm halos , given that the velocity dispersion tensor in this case is only mildly anisotropic .",
    "radii are normalized assuming that @xmath32 equals the shock radius of the self - similar solution , which corresponds to roughly one - third of the turnaround radius .",
    "the vertical normalization is arbitrary and has been chosen to match the n - body results at 0.01@xmath32 .",
    "taking @xmath49 to be a measure of the local `` entropy '' of the system , figure 1 shows that cdm halos have the same radial entropy stratification as the simple spherical collapse solution .",
    "it is possible that this power - law stratification is a fundamental property which underlies the similarity of structure of cold dark matter halos .",
    "density profiles consistent with the power - law phase - space density profile shown in figure 1 can be obtained by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium . for an isotropic ,",
    "spherically - symmetric system of collisionless particles , the jeans equation may be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath52 is the mass interior to @xmath53 ( binney and tremaine , 1987 , p.  198 ) .",
    "equation ( [ jeans ] ) is equivalent to the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a gas of pressure @xmath54 . dividing both sides of the equation by @xmath55 , and taking derivatives with respect to @xmath53",
    ", we can rewrite this equation as , @xmath56 where the last equivalence applies to a self - gravitating system .",
    "assuming that the phase - space density is a power - law of radius , i.e. that @xmath57 where @xmath3 is an ( arbitrary ) reference radius and @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and defining the dimensionless variables , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , ( [ j2 ] ) can then be written as , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a dimensionless measure of the velocity dispersion at @xmath3 .",
    "a simple interpretation of the parameter @xmath7 can be found by choosing @xmath3 to be @xmath64 , the radius where the circular velocity of the system peaks . in this case , and since @xmath65 , we can rewrite @xmath7 as , @xmath66 in other words , @xmath7 measures the local velocity dispersion of the system in units of its circular velocity at the radius where the circular velocity peaks .",
    "equation ( [ j5 ] ) has the form , @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 ) so given initial conditions @xmath69 and @xmath70 at @xmath71 , we can solve it numerically for @xmath72 or @xmath73 by integrating inwards or outwards .",
    "the resulting solutions are parameterized by @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath7 , so for @xmath76 , we obtain a two - parameter family of solutions . clearly , integrating ( [ j6 ] ) with respect to some different variable @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a constant , will produce an identical solution , provided that we scale @xmath75 by @xmath78 and @xmath7 by @xmath79 , so in fact the solutions are degenerate and there is effectively a single free parameter ( which we can take to be @xmath7 ) that characterizes the full solution set . to be positive , or negative but too small .",
    "in this case @xmath80 _ increases _ with @xmath53 and the solutions are unstable and lack direct physical interpretation . ]",
    "equation ( [ j6 ] ) admits power - law solutions .",
    "solving for @xmath81 gives the following conditions .",
    "for @xmath82 we have , @xmath83 while for @xmath84 the conditions are , @xmath85 for example , the singular isothermal sphere is recovered for @xmath86 .    thus assuming @xmath84 , that is , a finite velocity dispersion at @xmath3 , there is a single power - law solution to ( [ j6 ] ) with slope @xmath87 for @xmath88 .. ] it is convenient to set @xmath89 and to generate the family of solutions simply by varying @xmath7 .",
    "figure 2 shows a few of these solutions ( for @xmath76 ) , labeled by the particular value of @xmath7 beside each curve . with the exception of the power law , the shape of the equilibrium density profiles is complex , with an outer cutoff , one or more inflection points , and an inner cusp . for @xmath7 larger than some critical value , @xmath90 ,",
    "the solutions become non - monotonic , and the density vanishes at a finite radius .",
    "all solutions with @xmath91 appear to have a steep inner cusp with asymptotic slope close to @xmath92 , but the critical solution approaches asymptotically @xmath93 as @xmath53 tends to @xmath94 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the isotropic jeans equation admits a family of solutions for the density profile under the constraint @xmath95 .",
    "the family includes a power - law , @xmath96 , with @xmath97 ( for @xmath98 ) , which corresponds to bertschinger s spherical infall solution .",
    "this is shown with filled circles in figure 3 , where we also show the density profiles corresponding to the cdm halos in the n - body simulations .",
    "radii have been scaled here , as in figure 2 , to the radius where the slope of the density profile is @xmath99 , and densities to the critical density .",
    "clearly , the power - law solution is a poor fit to the result of the n - body simulations , which become noticeably shallower than @xmath100 near the center .",
    "the n - body results can be well fitted by the profile proposed by nfw , which is shown by the open triangles in figure 3 .",
    "interestingly , over approximately three decades in radius , _ the shape of the nfw profile is essentially indistinguishable from the `` critical '' solution _ alluded to above .",
    "discrepancies occur only at large radii , where substructure leads to systematic deviations from the power - law behaviour for the phase - space density .",
    "the meaning of the critical solution may be illustrated by considering the phase - space density distribution corresponding to the different solutions .",
    "this is shown in figure 4 for the solutions illustrated in figure 2 , for systems normalized to have the same total mass , energy , and mean density inside some fiducial radius .",
    "clearly , the phase - space distribution function is broadest for the power - law solution ( @xmath5 ) and gets increasingly narrower as @xmath7 increases ; the critical solution ( @xmath101 ) corresponds then to the most sharply peaked phase space distribution compatible with a monotonically decreasing ( non - hollow ) density profile and with the entropy stratification constraint .",
    "the critical solution may thus be interpreted as a `` maximally mixed '' configuration where the phase - space density is as uniform as possible across the system .",
    "this leads to the following interpretation for the origin of the nfw profile .",
    "gravitational assembly of cdm halos leads to a simple power - law radial stratification of the phase - space density .",
    "if spherical symmetry is imposed , as in the case treated by bertschinger ( 1985 ) , the collapsing radial mass shells generate progressively larger `` entropies '' ( lower phase - space densities ) as they pass through the shock and settle into hydrostatic equilibrium , leading to steeply cusped power - law profiles with slope @xmath102 . on the other hand , when the assumption of spherical symmetry is released and the collapse proceeds through many stages of hierarchical merging , mass shells are continuously `` mixed '' and the profiles tend to the critical solution : that corresponding to the most uniform entropy distribution compatible with a non - hollow density profile and with the power - law entropy stratification constraint .",
    "this density profile closely resembles the nfw profile over a large dynamic range in radius .    finally , it is important to note that , despite the similarity shown in figure 3 , there are important differences between the nfw profile and the critical solution , the most notable being that the latter tends to an asymptotic central slope of @xmath103 rather than to @xmath11 as in nfw s fitting formula . a simple approximation to the radial dependence of the slope of the `` critical '' density profile",
    "is given by @xmath104 which is accurate to @xmath105 for @xmath106 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the radius where the logarithmic slope of the density profile equals @xmath99 and @xmath107 , in terms of the nfw scale radius @xmath18 .",
    "the power - law phase - space density profile thus offers a natural way to describe the structure of dark matter halos at radii where simulations become increasingly difficult and expensive , but also where observational constraints are strongest .",
    "provided that the velocity dispersion tensor remains nearly isotropic , the `` critical '' solution provides a clear prediction as to the behaviour of the logarithmic slope of the density profile : it should become progressively shallower towards the center , converging asymptotically to a value of @xmath108 .",
    "this is interesting since , as mentioned in  1 , slopes shallower than @xmath24 appear to be consistent with the recent reanalysis of the rotation curve dataset by van den bosch ( 2000 ) and by van den bosch & swaters ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that a shallow central slope does not guarantee consistency with observations , which constrain the detailed radial dependence of the density profile slope as well .",
    "our results do , however , offer a clear prediction for extrapolating the mass profiles to regions that are very difficult to probe numerically .",
    "is the extrapolation of the power - law behaviour to very small radii warranted ?",
    "this question ultimately will have to be answered by direct numerical simulation , although there is no obvious a priori reason why a power law scaling that is valid for over two decades in radii should break down nearer the center .",
    "one important point to note is that the critical solution is clearly at odds with the proposal of moore ( 1998 ) and ghigna ( 2000 ) that the innermost slopes of cdm halos converge to a value not shallower than about @xmath24 .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that their conclusion was based on the simulation of a _ single _ halo simulated in a standard cdm universe ( scdm ) and on a significantly different mass regime ( galaxy clusters ) than probed here .",
    "thus the possibility remains that this particular system may not be representative of the general population or that the density profiles of clusters are steeper than those of galaxy - sized halos .",
    "since these authors use the same n - body code as in the present work and , indeed , we use their own results for galaxy - sized halos in this manuscript , it is unlikely that the discrepancy is due to subtle errors associated with the numerical setup of the simulations . confirming which of these possibilities holds",
    "will require a statistically significant sample of halos simulated with resolution comparable to the systems used here . finally , it is also possible that the cluster simulated by moore ( 1998 ) and ghigna ( 2000 ) differs from the galaxy - sized halos we present here in other , more subtle ways .",
    "for example , it may be significantly more triaxial than the systems analyzed here , or perhaps its velocity dispersion tensor is very anisotropic , in conflict with the assumptions of this work .",
    "again , a detailed reanalysis of the discrepant system , extended to a statistically meaningful sample , appears necessary in order to explain this discrepancy conclusively .",
    "we are currently working on this issue and plan to report our findings soon ( stadel et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we examine the spherically averaged phase - space density profiles of n - body simulations of cdm halos in the scdm and lcdm cosmologies and find that they are very well approximated by a power - law ( @xmath109 ) over more than two decades in radius .",
    "the slope of this power law is consistent with that of the self - similar solution for spherical secondary infall derived by bertschinger ( 1985 ) . assuming that the phase - space density profile is a power law , and assuming isotropy , hydrostatic equilibrium is satisfied by a family of density profiles controlled by a single - parameter .",
    "this parameter is determined by the ratio of the velocity dispersion to the `` natural '' velocity dispersion of the system at some fiducial radius , @xmath3 , @xmath110 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 can also be expressed in terms of the ratio of the circular velocity to the 1-d velocity dispersion at @xmath64 , the radius where the circular velocity peaks ( @xmath111 ) . for @xmath112 ,",
    "the density profile is a power - law , which agrees with bertschinger s solution .",
    "as @xmath7 increases the density profiles become increasingly curved , although they still approach the steep power - law divergent behaviour near the center . for @xmath7",
    "greater than some critical value @xmath113 the density profiles become unphysical , vanishing at some finite radius near the center .    the `` critical '' density profile ( @xmath101 )",
    "corresponds to the maximum value of @xmath7 consistent with a non - vanishing density profile at the center and _ is essentially indistinguishable from the profile proposed by navarro , frenk & white _ ( 1996 , 1997 ) for over two decades in radius .",
    "this solution corresponds to the most uniform ( more sharply peaked ) phase - space distribution compatible with a monotonically decreasing density profile and with the entropy stratification constraint .",
    "this suggests that the structure of cdm halos is determined by a radial phase - space density stratification process similar to that established through collapse onto a point mass perturbation in an unperturbed expanding universe , and by the uniformization of phase - space density that occurs presumably as a result of the many merger and satellite accretion events that characterize the assembly of a cdm halo .",
    "this identification leaves a couple of important questions unanswered , however : ( i ) why should the phase - space density be a power law of radius ? , and ( ii ) why is the exponent the same as in bertschinger s self - similar solution ? .",
    "although we have no clear answer to these questions at this point , our results suggest that explaining the origin of the structural similarity of cdm halos pointed out by navarro , frenk & white may entail unraveling why the radial stratification of phase - space density in cdm halos is the same power - law generated by the simple spherical collapse model .",
    "discovering a mechanism that achieves this may provide a simple explanation for the universal structure of cold dark matter halos .",
    "the authors wish to thank joachim stadel and tom quinn for kindly making their massively parallel code pkdgrav available as well as for their help and guidance running the simulations .",
    "we extend our thanks to the other members of their n - body collaboration , b.  moore , f.  governato , and g.  lake , for allowing us to use the data from their simulations .",
    "we also thank simon white for providing insightful comments on a preliminary version of this manuscript .",
