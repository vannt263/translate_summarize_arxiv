    "quantum many - body systems often possess several symmetries .",
    "for example , the hubbard model preserves total spin , total momentum , and some geometrical symmetries on a lattice .",
    "it is crucially important to identify the symmetry and quantum numbers in understanding the nature of the ground state , where a symmetry breaking , for example , often occurs in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the symmetry should be restored in finite size systems .",
    "however even in finite - size systems , the ground state and excitation spectra reflect the natures in their thermodynamic limits .",
    "their excitation spectra and spectroscopic properties are resulted from eigenstates of specified quantum numbers and play crucial roles in elucidating the nature of low - energy phenomena in condensed matter physics .    to investigate",
    "quantum many - body problems , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) approaches have been one of useful methods and can give ground state properties if there is no minus sign problem  @xcite .",
    "however , they can not fully take an advantage of symmetry explicitly and excitation spectra have not been well explored . furthermore ,",
    "if the minus sign problem becomes serious as in the case of the hubbard model on a non - bipartite lattice , qmc methods do not give a well convergent result .",
    "although the exact diagonalization methods handle the whole excitation spectra , tractable system size is severely limited .    in nuclear structure physics ,",
    "symmetry plays a primarily important role .",
    "for instance , as nucleus is a finite system , rotational symmetry is specially important .",
    "therefore symmetry has been continuously focused in order to solve nuclear quantum many - body problems .",
    "there are several ways to handle symmetries in nuclear structure problems . among them , the projection technique is powerful in the respect to broken symmetry and its restoration . in nucleus , a mean field solution is considered as the first approximation but it violates most of symmetries , i.e. , total angular momentum , parity , nucleon numbers and so on",
    ". then we restore all the symmetries by applying symmetry projection ( or in other words , quantum - number projection ) operators onto symmetry broken mean - field wavefunction .",
    "resultant quantum - number projected wavefunction is known to be able to give a better description .",
    "here we consider strongly correlated electrons on a lattice , which have symmetries as total spin , total momentum , and so on . in general ,",
    "explicit construction of symmetry imposed wavefucntion is quite complicated .",
    "for instance , wavefunction with a definite total spin needs complicated spin coupling among a large number of electrons",
    ". however , the projection technique enables us to easily handle symmetry imposed wavefunction .",
    "this projection method is well harmonized with the recently proposed path - integral renormalization group method ( pirg )  @xcite which has been quite a powerful tool and is free of the notorious minus - sign problem in investigating strongly correlated electron systems . in this method ,",
    "the ground state is described explicitly by superposition of basis states , which often break symmetries possessed by the hamiltonian when the numerically manageable number of the basis states , @xmath0 , is limited . by applying the projection operator to these basis states",
    ", we can exactly treat the symmetry and extract the state with a specified quantum number .",
    "we show that such a quantum - number projection technique can extensively widen applicability of the pirg in the following points : ( 1 ) precision of the numerical calculation is substantially improved .",
    "( 2 ) the quantum number of the ground state is exactly determined .",
    "( 3 ) the extended pirg by the quantum - number projection can handle excited states and spectroscopic properties in addition to the ground state .",
    "such low - energy excitations correspond , in nuclear structure physics , to the _ yrast _ state @xcite , which means the lowest energy state with specified quantum numbers(for nuclear structure , angular momentum ) .    in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate the method of quantum - number projection with examples of spin , spin parity , electron momentum and lattice symmetry . in sec .",
    "iii and sec .",
    "iv , we discuss an implementation of the quantum - number projection to the algorithm of the path - integral renormalization group ( pirg ) method .",
    "then several different ways of implementation are proposed in the order of increasing elaboration and accuracy . in sec .",
    "iii , we present algorithms and applications from this quantum - number projection technique applied afterwards to the obtained pirg wavefunctions .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "iv , we show algorithms of the quantum - number projection performed simultaneously with the pirg procedure , by which the lowest energy state with the specified quantum number is more efficiently extracted . we show that the present methods applied in sec .",
    "iii and sec .",
    "iv very efficiently improve the accuracy of the energy estimate .",
    "we show examples in the case of the hubbard model .",
    "we also show how the excitation spectra are obtained . in the example of the hubbard model with geometrical frustration effect , the present method enables to obtain the ground state as well as excitation spectra , which can not be obtained in the existing methods . in sec . v we summarize the results .",
    "in general , a basis state @xmath1 described by single slater determinant does not often satisfy definite symmetry properties .",
    "therefore , it can contain many components with unfixed quantum numbers , most of which are unnecessary for considering the specific eigenstate of considered system .",
    "here we consider a method to project out a component with a given quantum number from such a symmetry broken basis state .",
    "projection operator @xmath2 is usually defined as @xmath3 .",
    "if we act @xmath4 onto wavefunction @xmath1 , @xmath5 contains a component with the considered symmetry . by such quantum - number projected bases ,",
    "the corresponding projected matrix elements are evaluated by @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for norm , hamiltonian and other physical observable matrix elements , respectively , where @xmath9 is hamiltonian and @xmath10 means a physical observable .",
    "note that commutable property between observables and projection operator and projection property @xmath3 simplify projected matrix elements .",
    "for the physical variables , we assume that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are commutable each other . in this section",
    ", we discuss the spin , momentum and lattice symmetries .",
    "quantum mechanically , finite object with a fixed shape must be rotated to recover the original symmetry . for nucleus ,",
    "mean - field methods such as hartree - fock and hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximations , give its optimum wavefunction .",
    "though the rotational symmetry in the obtained wavefunction is broken , it directly relates the geometrical shape of nucleus .",
    "restoration of rotational symmetry can be carried out by superposing rotated wavefunction .",
    "this superposition can be exactly carried out by angular momentum projection .",
    "rotation in three dimensional space is specified by the euler s angles and the restoration of the symmetry is usually described by the integration over the euler s angles and weight of such superpositions is given by wigner s @xmath12 function .",
    "angular momentum projection can be achieved by three - fold integration over euler s angles as we will show later .",
    "though this derivation is shown in nuclear structure textbook  @xcite , in appendix a , we discuss some properties of the projection operator .    here",
    "we first consider the spin degrees of freedom of electrons .",
    "though the spin has no relation to any definite shape , algebraic structure is the same . as the derivation of angular momentum projection relies on the su(2 ) structure ,",
    "the same technique can be applied to electron s spin coupling .",
    "we consider to pick out the total - spin @xmath13 component from a basis state described by a slater determinant . as",
    "the slater determinant has a definite number of up and down electrons ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , @xmath16-projection of the spin is @xmath17 .",
    "this fact simplifies a projection operator to a rather simple one . in nuclear structure physics",
    ", it corresponds to the case of angular momentum projection for axially symmetric shape .",
    "the spin projection operator has a form as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is euler angle and @xmath20 is wigner s @xmath12 function . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 specify the @xmath16 component of the total spin , @xmath23 . as explained in the appendix a , eq.([proj_def ] ) , this projection operator operating as @xmath24 to a state @xmath25 filters out @xmath22 component of @xmath25 and generate a state which has @xmath26 by rotation .",
    "the rotation operator @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath23 are @xmath30 and @xmath16 components of spin operator , respectively .",
    "wigner s @xmath12 function is defined by this rotation operator as @xmath31 where @xmath32 . by this projector ,",
    "the spin projected state is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath35 has a definite @xmath23 value , @xmath36 , but @xmath37 generates different @xmath23 components .",
    "therefore successive @xmath38 selects finally needed @xmath23 components .",
    "although the @xmath23 value is not unique and can have values in the range @xmath39 in the case of @xmath40 , this degree of freedom @xcite is eliminated by the following property of the spin projector ; @xmath41 this relation can be easily proven by eq.([proj_def ] ) in appendix a. this relation shows that spin projection operator satisfies an extended projection property . as the pirg basis states have a definite @xmath16-component of spin , the following relation is satisfied ; @xmath42 as the special case of eq.([eqn:5 ] )",
    ". here we note that @xmath43 has a simpler form , which involves only one - dimensional integral , as @xmath44    in eq .",
    "( [ proj2 ] ) , we can take @xmath36 as the @xmath21 value . in this case , as the spin projection operator , we can use @xmath45 which satisfies usual projection property @xmath46 .",
    "therefore in a later discussion , the spin projection operator is simply denoted as @xmath47 by suppressing @xmath23 value .    because @xmath48 and @xmath49 commute each other",
    ", @xmath50 is satisfied .",
    "consequently , norm , hamiltonian and other physical observable matrix elements between spin - projected basis of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are shown as @xmath53 where rotated basis in spin space is defined as @xmath54 here we assume that @xmath10 is a scalar operator for spin rotation and @xmath55 and @xmath10 commutes  @xcite .",
    "note that , @xmath56 is a direct product as @xmath57 , while its rotated one needs a larger representation space as the up and down components are mixed .    for the case that the electron numbers of up and down spins are the same",
    ", the @xmath58 function simply reduces to legendre function @xmath59 , @xmath60    involved integral in eq.([integ ] ) can now be efficiently evaluated by the legendre - gauss quadrature in practical numerical calculations .",
    "this quadrature needs less mesh points than those of trapezoidal formula .",
    "typically , for @xmath61 of the half - filled electron system in 6@xmath626 and 12@xmath6212 lattices , we needs 12 and 24 mesh points , respectively , for numerical convergence . as spin goes up",
    ", larger number of meshes is needed .",
    "we consider partial spin projection for the restricted case that the electron numbers of up and down spins are the same .",
    "although it is not general , its scope is still wide .",
    "now we consider the interchange between up and down spin components and define a parity for this interchange .",
    "we show that the parity classifies the even and odd total spins .",
    "hereafter we call it spin parity",
    ".    the parity operator may be defined as @xmath63 , where we obtain @xmath64    this reads that @xmath65 parity wavefunction corresponds to even values for @xmath13 and @xmath66 parity wavefunction does to odd values .",
    "therefore , this spin parity projection @xmath67 yields to the classification between even and odd total - spin states .",
    "the spin - parity projected matrix elements are shown by @xmath68 where @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 takes @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "if we take the spin projection operator , the spin - parity projection becomes redundant .",
    "however , in the case of multiple quantum - number projection operators , numerical calculations inevitably become heavy .",
    "since the whole spin projection is much more computer - time consuming , the spin - parity projection is an alternative way particularly for the method of simultaneous quantum - number projection in each step of pirg as proposed in sec .",
    "iv .      in systems with translational invariance",
    ", the conservation of momentum holds .",
    "however , a basis state is not necessarily an eigenstate of the momentum operator . by the projection technique , we restore the translational symmetry .",
    "we define the momentum projection operator as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the normalization , @xmath76 is the momentum operator and @xmath77 is a shift in a lattice specified by @xmath78 . by applying this projection operator ,",
    "we can calculate projected matrix elements as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a shifted wavefunction by the shift @xmath78 . in an @xmath81 lattice",
    ", the momentum projection requires @xmath81 larger computation efforts than those of unprojected one .      in the hubbard model on a two - dimensional lattice , there are several geometrical symmetries on a lattice as @xmath82-reflection , @xmath30-reflection and @xmath82-@xmath30 interchange symmetries .",
    "their symmetries can be classified by parity . by the associated parity operator @xmath83",
    ", we can define the corresponding projection operator as @xmath84 similarly to the spin - parity projection .",
    "we briefly introduce the path integral renormalization group ( pirg ) method , which has recently been proposed for solving strongly interacting electron systems  @xcite . in general",
    ", the ground state @xmath85 can be obtained by applying the projector @xmath86 to an arbitrary state @xmath87 which is not orthogonal to the true ground state as @xmath88 in this paper , we consider the standard hubbard model on a two - dimensional square lattice defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 and @xmath93 here @xmath94 , @xmath78 represent lattice points and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) is a creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath97 on the @xmath94-th site .",
    "the summation over @xmath98 is for the nearest neighbor pairs and that over @xmath99 is for the next - nearest neighbor pairs on the 2d hubbard model on the square lattice .",
    "we impose the periodic boundary condition .",
    "we decompose @xmath100 $ ] into @xmath100 \\sim [ \\exp[-\\delta\\tau h_k]\\prod_i \\exp[-\\delta\\tau h_{u_i}]]^{\\cal n}$ ] for small @xmath101 , where @xmath102 .",
    "when we use the slater determinant as the basis functions , the operation of @xmath103 $ ] to a slater determinant simply transforms to another single slater determinant . on the other hand",
    ", the operation of @xmath104 $ ] can be performed by the stratonovich - hubbard transformation , where a single slater determinant is transformed to a linear combination of two slater determinants .",
    "one of numerical realizations of eq.([project ] ) is pirg method  @xcite .",
    "after the operation of @xmath100 $ ] , the projected wavefunction can be given by an optimal form composed of @xmath0 slater determinants as @xmath105 where @xmath106 s are amplitudes of @xmath107 .",
    "operation of the ground - state projection can give optimal @xmath106 s and @xmath107 s for a given @xmath0 .",
    "its detailed algorithm and procedure are found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    by a finite number @xmath0 , in most cases",
    ", it gives an overestimate of the exact energy eigenvalue , since this wavefunction satisfies the variational principle .",
    "therefore , a relation between energy difference @xmath108 and energy variance @xmath109 may be useful to extrapolate the energy into the true one . here",
    "the energy difference is defined as @xmath110 and the energy variance is defined as @xmath111 here , @xmath112 represents the true ground - state energy . for @xmath113",
    ", we evaluate the energy @xmath114 and energy variance @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath113 is a good approximation of the true state , the energy difference @xmath116 is proportional to the energy variance @xmath115 . therefore extrapolating @xmath114 into @xmath117 by increasing @xmath0 systematically",
    ", we can estimate accurate ground - state energy .",
    "now we consider an implementation of the quantum - number projection to the state obtained by pirg .",
    "the pirg gives approximated wavefunction for a given @xmath0 which is composed of @xmath0 linear combinations of @xmath118 .",
    "one possibility to implement the quantum - number projection is to project out as @xmath119 where @xmath11 is a quantum - number projection operator .",
    "we use the same amplitudes @xmath106 s and the same bases @xmath120 s which the pirg determines . on the other hand",
    ", this amplitude @xmath106 s can be easily reevaluated by diagonalization by using quantum - number projected bases , that is , we determine @xmath106 s by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem as @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "the latter procedure gives a lower energy eigenvalue . by adding this procedure for the pirg basis , we evaluate the projected energies and energy variances , @xmath124 and @xmath125 for each @xmath0 . we can estimate accurate energy by extrapolating the projected energy into zero variance .    as a result of the application of this procedure ,",
    "there appear two new aspects .",
    "one is that the energy estimate becomes more accurate . in general ,",
    "correlation energy comes from dynamical and symmetrical origins .",
    "original pirg seeks for better basis states which gain both correlation energies in a compromised way . on the other hand , by the quantum - number projection operator , correlation energy originated in the symmetry is exactly evaluated .",
    "consequently , the projected energy becomes much lower than the unprojected energy at a given @xmath0 .",
    "if we use sufficiently large @xmath0 , both values are the same and become the exact ground state energy . in practical problems , however , we have to use finite number @xmath0 and exact energy is estimated by extrapolation .",
    "therefore , at the same @xmath0 , better energy is useful for better estimation of the exact energy .",
    "the second point is that it enables the evaluation of excitation spectra .",
    "if we use projection technique , evaluation of excited states with different symmetry quantum numbers becomes easier .",
    "the pirg basis states for @xmath0 still have components of excitations which most likely belong to low - lying excited states . by projecting out the component with different quantum numbers from that of the desired one",
    ", we can evaluate such excited states .",
    "we note the lowest energy state with the specified quantum number ( namely , the yrast state ) is obtained .",
    "we demonstrate how the method of quantum - number projection procedure applied to the pirg wavefunction works by comparing with the exact results .",
    "first we consider the half - filled case on @xmath126 lattice with @xmath127 .",
    "its exact ground - state energy is -29.62185 .",
    "the extrapolated energy of the pirg is -29.488 , when we use the data up to @xmath128 .",
    "we note that the auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method  @xcite with rather large @xmath129 also gives a similar value to that of the pirg .",
    "there is some discrepancy between this energy and the exact one .",
    "this discrepancy comes from the remaining contribution from the higher - spin states contained in the projected wavefunction both in the pirg and the qmc calculations . to obtain the real ground - state estimate",
    ", we need much larger @xmath130 .",
    "spin projection can remove it very efficiently . in fig .",
    "[ spin ] , we show spin projected energies of @xmath0=8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 and 320 are plotted as a function of energy variances . the energy variance becomes smaller for larger @xmath0 .",
    "in fact if the correct ground state is given , the variance becomes zero .",
    "as these energies are well scaled linearly as functions of the energy variance when the variance is small , the extrapolation to the zero variance works well .",
    "the extrapolated ground state energy is -29.611 , which is quite close to the exact one .",
    "this result can also be compared with the variational monte carlo calculation with the gutzwiller projection  @xcite , which gives -29.47 @xcite .",
    "the su(2 ) symmetric monte carlo calculation  @xcite gives much better estimate  @xcite with a reasonable value of @xmath131 .",
    "this is similar to the pirg with the spin projection . in this sense ,",
    "exact treatment of spin quantum number is crucial in obtaining the exact ground state in an efficient way in the present case .    in fig .",
    "[ spin ] , projected energies with @xmath132 are also shown as functions of the energy variance .",
    "in addition to the ground state , excited states with @xmath132 have a good linear scaling .",
    "thus we can evaluate energies of the excited states with different spins by the present spin projection technique .",
    "this fact shows an essential advantage of the pirg combined with the quantum - number projection technique , if one compares with the other type of numerical methods including the monte carlo methods .",
    "( 300,200 ) ( 0,0 )    we investigate these extrapolations more closely . for @xmath133 and @xmath134 ,",
    "extrapolated energies are very close to the exact ones , while for @xmath135 , the extrapolated energy is , to some extent , deviated from the exact one .",
    "as the pirg is the projection to the ground state , the obtained wavefunction represents the ground state approximately .",
    "therefore , as the total spin increases , amplitudes of @xmath136 components in the pirg wavefunction are expected to become smaller , because such high - energy component is already efficiently eliminated out by the pirg projection process . therefore extrapolated energy for higher - spin ( for example @xmath135 state ) is worse than those of lower - spin ( for example , @xmath61 and @xmath133 states ) , because the higher energy states are almost missing in the pirg states .",
    "moreover , at a fixed @xmath0 , the variance becomes larger as the spin goes up , which makes the extrapolation worse .",
    "this also indicates that the quality of projected wavefunctions becomes worse .",
    "we propose an improved algorithm to solve this difficulty for excited states in sec .",

    "the higher spin state at @xmath135 with the spin - momentum projection , to some extent , has a better extrapolated energies than the spin projection only , while there still remains a tendency that the extrapolation becomes worse as the total spin goes up or the excitation energy increases . to overcome this defect",

    "although the spin projection is important , the spin rotation in spin space mixes the up and down spin components and we need the twice as large space as the original one for the green function in the pirg procedure , which makes the pirg computation heavy . then for the multiple projection of qp - pirg , to save the computation time , we propose , for a practical use , a combination of the momentum and the spin - parity projection instead of the full spin - momentum projection . by this approach , the pirg wavefunction does not have a good spin quantum number . to restore the spin symmetry perfectly , after the qp - pirg procedure above",
    ", we again perform the full spin projection afterwards .",
    "namely , to obtain a final result , @xmath161 is applied .",
    "this constitutes the full procedure of qp - pirg .    at each quantum - number projection , the integrations or summation such as those in eqs.([integ ] ) and ( [ momentum ] ) , can be very efficiently parallelized in actual computations if parallel processors are available . in each process , we store the green function @xmath162 , while the update of the green function after the operation of each @xmath163 is written as @xmath164 or @xmath165 where @xmath166|\\psi_{\\beta}\\rangle,\\ ] ] with @xmath97 being the stratonovich auxiliary variable and @xmath167 .",
    "when one term of the sum over @xmath97 is taken in the truncation process , the updated green function is efficiently calculated from the old green function @xmath168 in the same way as eq.(3.10)-(3.14 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "( 300,200 ) ( 0,0 )    now we show numerical results of qp - pirg .",
    "we first show the case of 6 by 6 lattice at @xmath169 and @xmath170 . in fig .",
    "[ 6by6extrap ] , we show the extrapolation of qp - pirg result by green open circles by using the projection up to @xmath171 . as we discussed , the qp - pirg with quantum - number projected bases seeks for optimum _ yrast _ states concerning the considered symmetry in every pirg process . in this calculation",
    ", we took spin - parity and momentum projection operators . for @xmath61 and @xmath137 state ,",
    "we use @xmath172 .",
    "as the obtained wavefunction still contains @xmath173 components , we apply @xmath174 projection operators afterwards for final results .",
    "this qp - pirg can generate a better wavefunction than the pirg+qp state as we see in the comparison with blue closed circles . here",
    "we show results of the pirg+qp state obtained after spin - momentum projection .",
    "in fact , for @xmath61 with @xmath137 state , in the pirg+qp result even at @xmath175 , the energy is -66.5765 , while the same energy can be given at @xmath176 by the qp - pirg .",
    "this means that for the ground state , basis states are more elaborately selected by the qp - pirg .",
    "thus , the quantum - number projection simultaneously with the pirg provides an efficient way of obtaining better wavefunctions .",
    "the extrapolated ground - state energy is -66.879 which is well within the statistical error of the previously cited monte carlo energy .",
    "in fact , from the extrapolation procedure in fig .",
    "[ 6by6extrap ] , the accuracy of the qp - pirg seems to have more than 4 digits and is higher than the accuracy of the presently referred quantum monte carlo result  @xcite , since the energy at @xmath171 is already lower than the upper bound of the monte carlo estimate .",
    "namely , the qp - pirg result seems to give the highest accuracy among these comparisons .",
    "in addition , we have also shown in fig .",
    "[ 6by6extrap ] an alternative way of the extrapolation .",
    "the red symbols are derived from the largest @xmath0 state after qp - pirg , where @xmath171 in this case .",
    "this state is represented by @xmath0 basis functions . after ordering these basis functions from the largest weight in the linear combination",
    ", we may truncate the basis functions by taking only the @xmath177 states from that with the largest weight . by using these truncated functions with different @xmath177",
    ", we have plotted the energy and variance of these truncated states .",
    "this gives very close estimate to the qp - pirg result shown above as the open green circles .",
    "a small difference between this procedure and the original qp - pirg is seen at larger variance .",
    "this may be due to the fact that at small @xmath0 , the present truncation at small @xmath177 does not necessarily give the lowest energy state with @xmath177 .",
    "another possible origin is that the iteration of the present qp - pirg is not sufficient in reaching the lowest energy state under the constraint of each @xmath0 . in any case , the linearity of the plot in the plane of the energy and the variance is well satisfied in both cases , particularly for the latter procedure , and the asymptotic slopes at large @xmath0 look the same .      in the previous section",
    ", we consider the standard hubbard model with @xmath178 .",
    "conventional quantum monte carlo calculation could be performed to investigate such ground state properties .",
    "the pirg is an alternative method in this respect while it and its extension have an advantage in investigating the excitation spectra .",
    "especially , quantum - number projection enables us to handle _ yrast _ states with the same effort as the ground state .",
    "however , it is expected that the 2d hubbard model with @xmath178 has an antiferromagnetic long - ranged order in the thermodynamic limit and has a simple low - energy structure . to test the efficiency of our algorithm in a more severe condition",
    ", we investigate the extended hubbard model by including the next - nearest neighbor transfer , which causes the geometrical frustration effect .",
    "the quantum monte carlo method is known to have a severe difficulty when @xmath179 becomes large .",
    "recently by using the pirg method , the non - magnetic insulator ( nmi ) phase has been found near the mott transition for relatively large @xmath179  @xcite .",
    "this phase can not be investigated by the monte carlo methods due to severe minus sign problems .",
    "therefore , the pirg is so far the only technique suited for this study .",
    "here we explore how the present quantum - number projection technique improves the precision of the pirg in such a study . here",
    "we consider the half - filled system on 4 by 4 lattice with @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "monte carlo method does not give us convergent results because of the minus sign problem at this parameter value .",
    "we compare our results with the exact one .",
    "( 300,200 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 300,200 ) ( 0,0 )    in figs .  [ dispersion1 ] and [ dispersion2 ]",
    ", we show comparison of the dispersions obtained by the qp - pirg with the exact diagonalization result .",
    "this system has the ground state at @xmath61 and @xmath182 .",
    "the @xmath61 with @xmath183 state severely competes with this ground state .",
    "the lowest - energy @xmath133 state has @xmath184 .",
    "this energy is very close to those of doubly degenerate @xmath137 states and the second lowest state with @xmath133 and @xmath184 .",
    "the comparison of qp - pirg ( red circles ) and the exact diagonalization results ( black crosses ) in figs .  [ dispersion1 ] and",
    "[ dispersion2 ] indicates excellent agreement .",
    "in general , the errors are less than 0.01 , which means the accuracy higher than the 4 digits .",
    "we have presented the quantum - number projection technique and its implementation to the pirg method , both of which works well irrespective of the details of the considered system .",
    "the quantum - number projection method can pick up a component with required symmetries from symmetry broken wavefunctions ( i.e. , mean field wavefunction and so on ) . in the hubbard - type model ,",
    "the symmetries have a significant role in the low - energy states .",
    "in particular , spin , momentum and lattice symmetries play specially important roles in determining the low - energy states .",
    "restoration of the spin symmetry can be carried out by taking a spin projection operator , which is the same technique as the angular momentum projection in nuclear structure physics .",
    "spin rotation is performed in the spin space and the spin projection is represented by one dimensional integral for the rotation .",
    "the momentum projection is simply given from the superposition of spatially translated basis functions .",
    "we have also considered geometrical symmetry on a lattice for projections such as the inversion and rotation symmetries .",
    "quantum - number projection operator @xmath11 is represented by the sum of exponential of one - body operator . in the pirg",
    ", the wavefunction is expressed by a linear combination of @xmath0 basis states , while the symmetries are not retained in each basis state in general .",
    "then the quantum - number projection is efficiently introduced for each basis state . in the present paper , we have introduced two ways of implementing quantum - number projection into the pirg .",
    "one way is to carry out quantum - number projection afterwards for the already obtained pirg wavefunction ( pirg+qp ) . the ground state is efficiently extracted by specifying the quantum number with higher accuracy than the pirg only .",
    "although the pirg does not efficiently pick up the excited states , we can obtain several low - lying excited states with various symmetries from the pirg wavefucntion , if a small portion of the excited states still remain after the pirg procedure .",
    "other is to carry out the pirg by using quantum - number projected basis states ( qp - pirg ) . by this extended pirg",
    ", we can precisely evaluate excitation spectra .",
    "although qp - pirg requires more computation time , the accuracy of the ground state is more improved than pirg+qp , particularly for the excitation spectra .    in numerical calculations",
    ", quantum - number projection can be performed exactly . moreover , as quantum - number projection operators @xmath11 are commutable with hamiltonian @xmath49 , the relation @xmath185 simplifies numerical calculations . as examples ,",
    "the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm has been tested for the standard hubbard model on two - dimensional square lattice as well as for the 2d hubbard model with nonzero next nearest neighbor transfer , where geometrical frustration effects are large .",
    "we have shown that the quantum - number projection implemented to the pirg excellently works . more concretely , the spin projection and spin - momentum projection by pirg+qp greatly improve the accuracy of energy .",
    "qp - pirg further improves the accuracy of the extrapolated energy .",
    "this algorithm also enables accurate calculations of low - lying excitation spectra with different quantum numbers from those of the ground state .",
    "the energy dispersions of the specified total spin have been shown to give highly accurate results , particularly by using the qp - pirg method .",
    "this accuracy does not depend on the details of the lattice structure and the dimensionality . in our examples",
    "the accuracy becomes higher or comparable to 4 digits .",
    "when the system size increases in the 2d hubbard model , we do not have a relevant clue to judge the accuracy of the calculation by the present algorithm . on the half - filled case , however , we can compare the results with the quantum monte carlo results and the agreement is satisfactory . to reach the same accuracy",
