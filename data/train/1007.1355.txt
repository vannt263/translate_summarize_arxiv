    "the transversity of the nucleon is an important issue in hadron physics  @xcite ( see also the review  @xcite ) , since , together with the helicity distribution , they are the leading - twist parton distributions with which one tries to understand the spin structure of the nucleon . however , it is of great difficulty to measure the transversity of the nucleon because it decouples from deep inelastic scattering due to its chiral - odd nature . only very recently ,",
    "information on the transversity of the nucleon is available from the transverse spin asymmetry @xmath7 of drell - yan processes in @xmath8 reactions  @xcite as well as the azimuthal single spin asymmetry in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) @xcite .",
    "the chiral - odd nucleon matrix element is parameterized by three form factors @xcite which we denote as @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the first one was studied in ref . @xcite together with the tensor charges within the su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath12qsm ) . beside the tensor charges",
    "@xcite , also the linear combination @xmath13 was found to be interesting .",
    "it was found that @xmath14 is a more fundamental quantity  @xcite than @xmath15 and @xmath16 by themselves and describes the transverse deformation of the transverse polarized quark distribution in an unpolarized nucleon .",
    "burkardt  @xcite investigated the connection of the quantity @xmath17 to the boer - mulders function @xmath18 @xcite and presented the relation @xmath19 which is similar to the relation of the sivers - function @xmath20 @xcite to the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the latter relation is confirmed by the hermes collaboration @xcite .",
    "the boer - mulders function @xmath18 represents the asymmetry of the transverse momentum of quarks perpendicular to the quark spin in an unpolarized nucleon , while the sivers function explains the transverse momentum asymmetry of quarks in a transversely polarized target .",
    "both the sivers- and boer - mulders functions contribute to sidis processes and a measurement of @xmath18 can provide information on the anomalous tensor magnetic moment @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "however , it is very hard to measure chiral - odd observables .",
    "so far , only the transversity distribution @xmath23 was extracted @xcite , based on a global analysis of the data of the azimuthal single spin asymmetry in sidis processes @xmath24 by the belle  @xcite , hermes  @xcite and compass  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the corresponding tensor charges were obtained as @xmath25 and @xmath26 at a scale of @xmath27 @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we aim at investigating the anomalous tensor magnetic form factors of the nucleon and extend our previous study on the nucleon tensor form factors  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous tensor magnetic moment is interpreted as a quantity that describes how the average position of quarks with spin in the @xmath28-direction is shifted to the @xmath29-direction for an unpolarized target relative to the transverse center of the momentum  @xcite .",
    "some amount of theoretical works on the anomalous tensor magnetic moment was already performed , for example , in light - cone constituent quark models @xcite , on the lattice @xcite , in the su(2 ) @xmath12qsm",
    "@xcite and estimations given in ref .",
    "presently all the results indicate positive values of the anomalous tensor magnetic moment for the up and down quarks , i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we will use the self - consistent su(3 ) and su(2 ) chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath12qsm )  @xcite in order to compute the anomalous tensor magnetic moments .",
    "the @xmath12qsm is an effective chiral model for qcd in the low - energy regime , consisting of constituent quarks and the pseudo - scalar mesons as the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "originally , the @xmath12qsm was developed based on the qcd instanton vacuum  @xcite and has only a few free parameters .",
    "these parameters can mostly be fixed to the meson masses and decay constants in the mesonic sector .",
    "the only free parameter in the baryon sector is the constituent quark mass that is fixed by reproducing the nucleon electric charge radius .",
    "hence , all other baryon observables are obtained in exactly the same framework without adjusting further parameters . in the past ,",
    "the model was very successful in describing basically all baryon observables@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the renormalization scale for the @xmath12qsm is naturally given by the cut - off parameter for the regularization which is about @xmath32 .",
    "note that it is implicitly related to the inverse of the size of instantons ( @xmath33 )  @xcite .",
    "it plays in particular an important role in investigating the tensor charges and anomalous tensor magnetic moments of the nucleon , since they depend on the renormalization scale already at one - loop level .",
    "we sketch the work as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly explain how to derive the anomalous tensor magnetic moments within the framework of the @xmath12qsm . in section",

    "we have already calculated the tensor form factor @xmath53 within the same framework .",
    "we proceed in this work to the anomalous tensor magnetic form factor @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , it is technically rather complicated to consider the form factor @xmath55 and also @xmath56 .",

    "it is convenient to define a combined form factor @xmath65 as @xmath66 so that the third form factor @xmath56 is expressed in terms of the other three form factors as follows : @xmath67    inserting this in the definition @xmath68 , we are able to reexpress the flavor - decomposed anomalous tensor magnetic moments as @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath40 .    thus , in the present work we aim at calculating eq .",

    "@xcite for a detailed description of how to solve the form factors numerically .",

    "in the present work , we aimed at investigating the anomalous tensor magnetic moments @xmath14 and its corresponding form factors of the proton within the framework of the self - consistent su(3 ) and su(2 ) chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath12qsm ) .",
    "generally , the anomalous tensor magnetic moments are given by two contributions : @xmath123 where @xmath111 is the tensor charge and @xmath124 is a certain linear combination of the form factors appearing in the nucleon matrix element of the tensor current .",
    "we first computed the quantities @xmath124 in the su(3 ) and su(2 ) version of the @xmath12qsm .",
    "we saw that , in contrast to the tensor charges @xmath111 , the quantities @xmath125 have in the present framework noticeable contributions from the dirac - sea and linear strange quark mass corrections .",
    "interestingly , in the case of the su(3 ) version these two contributions arrange each other in such a way that their combined su(3 ) value is comparable to the su(2 ) dirac - sea value . as a whole ,",
    "since the valence quark contribution in both versions is nearly the same , we obtain therefore for the components @xmath126 in both versions consistent ( comparable ) values . for the strange quantity @xmath127",
    "we see a rather sensitive behavior with respect to the constituent quark mass , the only free parameter in the @xmath12qsm . we regard therefore this quantity to be at the numerical limit of accuracy of the @xmath12qsm . however , we observed for every given numerical setup that the individual parts of @xmath127 tend to cancel each other .",
    "we infer from this that the @xmath12qsm predicts a small @xmath127 .",
    "the tensor charges @xmath111 were investigated with the present framework in ref .",
    "@xcite . combining the result of that work with the quanties @xmath124 of the present one , we were able to predict the anomalous tensor magnetic moments",
    "the values of @xmath129 turned out to be positive with the su(3 ) values @xmath130 and @xmath131 while those of @xmath132 were given in the range of @xmath133 .",
    "this numerical uncertainty for @xmath132 is carried over from @xmath134 as well as the tendency that the individual parts of @xmath132 are destructively interfereing for any given numerical setup . accordingly to @xmath127 , we infer that @xmath132 is at the numerical limit of accuracy of the @xmath12qsm but that a small , nearly vanishing @xmath132 is predicted .",
    "the su(2 ) @xmath12qsm values of @xmath129 are : @xmath135 and @xmath131 which are comparable to the su(3 ) counterparts .",
    "we compared the present results of @xmath129 with those of other works .",
    "they are in qualitative agreement with each other with the hierachy : @xmath136 for a renormalization scale below @xmath137 .",
    "we also investigated the anomalous tensor magnetic form factors @xmath138 of the proton up to a momentum transfer of @xmath139 . while the up and down form factors @xmath119 and @xmath120 fall off as @xmath50 increases , the strange form factor @xmath132 starts to grow slowly and then gets lessened mildly from around @xmath140 gev as @xmath50 increases .",
    "this @xmath50 dependence of the strange form factor seems very similar to the neutron electric form factor .",
    "we compared the results of the up and down form factors with those of the lattice and found that while for @xmath119 the lattice result falls off more slowly than the present one , the present result for @xmath120 is pretty much similar to the lattice one . by combining the calculation of the electromagnetic form factors with the present results and those of the tensor form factors  @xcite , we will be able to get access to the first moment of the transverse quark spin density which yields information on the correlation of transverse coordinate and spin degrees of freedom that are related to the sivers and boer - mulders functions  @xcite .",
