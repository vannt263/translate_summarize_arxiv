    "over the past decade , hundreds of brown dwarfs ( bds ) have been identified in the solar neighborhood and in star - forming regions , yet there is no consensus on their origins .",
    "one possibility is that they form like stars , as a result of the turbulent fragmentation and collapse of molecular cloud cores ( e.g. , padoan & nordlund 2004 ) .",
    "another scenario , which has gained popularity in recent years , is that bds are stellar embryos ejected from multiple proto - stellar systems ( reipurth & clarke 2001 ; bate et al .",
    "recent observations have attempted to distinguish among these scenarios , by comparing physical properties of brown dwarfs and very low mass stars ( which we refer to together as very low mass objects , or vlmos , here ) with those of solar - mass stars .",
    "numerous studies have shown that many _",
    "young _ vlmos exhibit infrared excesses ( e.g. , muench et al .",
    "2001 ; natta et al . 2002 ; jayawardhana et al .",
    "2003a ; scholz et al .",
    "2007 ) and spectroscopic signatures of accretion ( e.g. , jayawardhana et al .",
    "2002 , 2003b ; natta et al . 2004",
    "; mohanty et al .",
    "2005 ) , indicative of disks . but",
    "both these diagnostics are only sensitive to the innermost portions of the disk and therefore can not test whether bd disks are truncated , as expected in the ejection scenario .",
    "recently , by modeling mid - infrared and millimeter emission , scholz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that @xmath525% of taurus bds in their sample have disks with radii @xmath510 au , contrary to predictions of certain ejection simulations , but some truncated disks may be hidden among their non - detections at 1.3 mm .",
    "the spatial distribution and kinematics of bds , in comparison with stars , do not provide definitive tests either ; ejection models predict velocities comparable to the velocity dispersions of star - forming associations and clusters , i.e. , 1 - 2 km / s ( moraux & clarke 2005 ) .    in this context",
    ", the multiplicity properties of vlmos such as frequency , separations , and mass ratios could be among the most important diagnostics of their origin .",
    "in particular , ejection models predict a very low rate of binaries among bds ( @xmath65 - 8% ) and does not favor the formation of many wide ( @xmath520 au ) binary systems ( e.g. , bate et al .",
    "direct imaging surveys of ( old ) field vlmos have yielded a binary frequency of @xmath115% for ( apparent ) separations @xmath71 au , with maximum separations of @xmath820 au ( e.g. , bouy et al .",

    "a search for spectroscopic binaries among the field vlmos add another @xmath111% ( basri & reiners 2006 ) .",
    "open clusters older than @xmath1100 myr also appear to lack wide binary brown dwarfs ( e.g. , martn et al .",
    "2003 ; bouy et al .",
    "2006a ) . at face value",
    ", these findings seem to support the ejection scenario though typical binary separation may decrease at lower masses even in the turbulent fragmentation model .",
    "however , perhaps somewhat surprisingly , several wide binary vlm systems have been discovered within the past few years . among them",
    "are : 2mass j1101 - 7732 ( @xmath9240 au ) in the @xmath12-myr - old chamaeleon i star - forming region ( luhman 2004 ) , 2mass j1207 - 3932 ( @xmath940 au ) in the @xmath18-myr - old tw hydrae association ( chauvin et al .",

    "2mass j1207 - 3932 and oph 1622 - 2405 are especially intriguing because the secondaries have masses approaching the planetary regime .",
    "if wide binaries , such as these six , are common among vlmos , that would present a critical challenge to ejection models .",

    "2007 sample ) that would be considered wide by the ejection model standards . here",
    "we report on an additional effort to constrain the frequency of wide vlm systems in other star forming regions .",
    "in particular , we describe a near - infrared adaptive optics imaging survey of 28 vlmos in chamaeleon i designed to investigate whether multiplicity in the vlm regime depends on age .",
    "given its proximity ( 160pc ; whittet et al .",
    "1997 ) and youth ( @xmath12myr ; luhman 2004 ) , the chamaeleon i star - forming region is well suited for investigating multiplicity of young vlmos .",
    "we observed 28 targets with spectral types of m5.25m8 from the recent compilation by luhman ( 2004 ) ; their membership in cha i is supported by several diagnostics including proper motion , radial velocity and position on the h - r diagram .",
    "six additional ( random ) vlm members reported in the census ( 3 m5.25 , 1 m5.5 , 1 m5.75 , 1 m6 ) were not observed due to worsening atmospheric conditions . according to baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2003 ) models , our targets span the mass range of @xmath10 ( table 1 ) .",
    "we obtained near - infrared @xmath11- and @xmath12-band images of 26 of these targets with the naos - conica ( naco , for short ) instrument on the 8.2 m yepun unit of the european southern observatory s very large telescope on paranal , chile over three consecutive nights starting on march 24 , 2006 .",
    "we used the high - resolution lens of naco , with a pixel scale of 13.26 mas / pix and a field - of - view of @xmath13 .",
    "for all observations , we utilized the infrared wavefront sensor ( wfs ) mode n90c10 , which directs 90% of the light to the wfs and the rest to conica .",
    "targets themselves served as natural guide stars ( ngss ) for the wfs . for each target , six 20 second exposures were combined to produce the final image .",
    "two other cha i targets , chah@xmath14 and eso559 , were observed in service mode between 2005 may ",
    "september using the same instrument set up , along with c-41 in chamaeleon ii ( see barrado y navascus & jayawardhana 2004 ) , gy 5 in @xmath15 oph ( greene & young 1992 ) and 2massw j1207334 - 393254 in the tw hydrae association ( gizis 2002 ) .",
    "the latter is known to harbor a planetary mass companion at a separation of @xmath140 au ( chauvin et al .",
    "2004 ; mohanty et al .",
    "2007 ) , and thus served as a cross - check on our sensitivity .",
    "these five targets were observed only in the @xmath16-band , each with a total integration time of 18 minutes .",
    "we inspected the final images , reduced in a standard manner using the naco pipeline software , visually to look for possible companions . in order to determine our ability to detect companions , we also derived contrast sensitivity curves through statistical analysis of the noise in annuli surrounding the central object",
    ". then we calculated the 5-@xmath17 detection limit as a function of separation from the primary for each of the targets .",
    "more details on the algorithm for deriving these sensitivities are given in brandeker et al .",
    "we checked the accuracy of the procedure by artificially inserting faint companions into the images at various separations and trying to recover them ; the results were consistent .",

    "( 1998 , 2003 ) models for the appropriate age : 2 myr for cha i , 1 myr for @xmath15 oph and cha ii , and 8 myr for tw hydrae .    to search for companions at smaller separations",
    ", we carried out point spread function ( psf ) subtraction for the cha i targets from the primary naco run . to construct a template psf",
    ", we averaged the psfs of our brightest targets . by varying the combinations of objects used for the template psf and comparing the results for consistency",
    ", we made sure not to include a binary in the template psf .",
    "none of our objects shows a clear signature of a companion after psf subtraction . for a more quantitative check",
    ", we used an approach similar to the procedure suggested by bouy et al .",
    "( 2006a ) : after psf subtraction , we measured the residual scatter and looked for objects which show excessive noise in the psf area .",
    "again , none of our objects shows significantly increased noise , defined as 3@xmath17 excess above the average .    to probe the adequacy of this test",
    ", we inserted artificial companions for selected objects at separations of 10au and 6au with roughly equal brightness .",
    "companions at 10au were reliably detected , by visually inspecting the image before and after psf subtraction .",
    "they also cause clearly enhanced scatter after psf subtraction . thus , we are confident that our companion search is complete down to 10au for roughly equal mass systems . at 6au , we can still recover artificial companions around the brightest of our targets , but for the fainter ones both the visual inspection and the noise analysis fail .",
    "we conclude that our companion search is probably not complete for separations @xmath18au . for the brightest @xmath19 objects , however , we can safely exclude the existence of roughly equal mass companions down to separations of 6au .",
    "we find three resolved binaries in the cha i sample : chah@xmath3  2 , chxr 15 and hn  13 ( fig . 1 and table 2 ) .",
    "the first was suspected to be a binary by neuhuser et al .",
    "( 2002 ) based on its elongated psf in _ hubble space telescope _ images .",
    "we are also able to recover the previously known companion to 2m1207 in our images .",
    "we do not find companions to any other targets .",
    "interestingly , chah@xmath3  2 , chxr 15 and hn  13 are all at the high mass end of our target sample : all have masses @xmath20 , clearly above the sub - stellar boundary .",
    "two of the binaries , chah@xmath3  2 and hn  13 , have mass ratios close to unity ( @xmath210.9 ) and are slighthly wider ( @xmath22 ) than most binaries found in the field .",
    "chxr 15 stands out more : it has a lower mass ratio ( @xmath23 ) and a wider separation ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "2 shows our detection limits as a function of companion mass ( according to baraffe et al .",
    "models ) and separation ( assuming a distance of 160 pc ) .",
    "the survey is able to detect binaries with mass ratios ( @xmath25 ) as low as 0.2 for all but one target at 50 au , and planetary mass companions at larger separations .",
    "our results suggest that wide vlm systems with ultra low mass companions , such as oph 1622 - 2405 ( jayawardhana & ivanov 2006 ) , are rare .",
    "we return to this point in the discussion .    for comparison , we also plot the binaries found by fischer & marcy ( 1992 ) among field stars with primary masses of 0.1 - 0.6@xmath26 and by close et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , burgasser et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and siegler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) among field vlm objects with @xmath27@xmath28 .",
    "our survey would have detected nearly all binaries with @xmath520 au and @xmath29 0.6 in these comparison samples .",
    "for our cha i sample , with primary masses between @xmath10.02 - 0.2@xmath26 , we find a binary frequency of @xmath4 in the regime where our survey is sensitive to companions ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "our findings in cha i are similar to what kraus et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) have reported for vlmos in taurus and upper scorpius star - forming regions . a recent survey of taurus by konopacky et al .",
    "( 2007 ) targeting mainly vlm stars has revealed a larger multiplicity fraction of wider systems with lower mass ratios , although the binary frequency is still in statistical agreement with our results .",
    "in fact , the four surveys target primaries in the same mass range and have comparable detection limits for companions . ] .",
    "thus , we can combine the results of all four surveys ( 12 vlm targets in upper scorpius , 32 in taurus and 28 in chamaeleon i ) to arrive at a more statistically significant sample of 72 young vlmos with an overall resolved binary frequency of @xmath31 .",
    "if we just consider t - associations ( taurus and chamaeleon i ) , then the multiplicity fraction is @xmath32 . in both cases we use @xmath33 and @xmath34 as our sensitivity limit .",
    "we can now compare the binary properties of young vlmos with other populations of interest , such as field vlmos and young stars , to explore possible variations with mass and/or age .",
    "we used a fisher `` exact '' statistical test for comparing samples of binomial distributions , as detailed in appendix b of brandeker et al .",
    "the results are given in table 3 , where `` likelihood '' refers to the probability that the multiplicity frequencies of the two samples are the same .      in order to explore the dependence of the binary frequency on mass",
    "we statistically compare several samples spanning different mass bins . as shown in table 3 and fig .",
    "4 , we constrain the @xmath25 and separation range as appropriate to ensure that the two samples being compared have the same sensitivity limits for companions . we ensure that samples that are compared are of similar age by only comparing binaries from young associations ( cha i , taurus and upper scorpius ) .",
    "in addition we also address the potential concern about the environmental effects by performing every comparison with and without the 12 targets in upper scorpius as it is the only higher density association that contributes binaries to our combined sample .",
    "we find that our conclusions are not affected by inclusion of these additional binaries .",
    "we start by dividing the young vlmos themselves into two groups , following kraus et al .",
    "( 2006 ) : one with primary masses less than 0.07 @xmath26 and the other with primary masses greater than 0.07 @xmath26 .",
    "all eight resolved vlmo binaries within the sensitivity limits ( fig .",
    "4a ) are in the higher mass bin .",
    "the likelihood of the two mass bins having the same binary frequnecy if only t - associations are compared is low ( @xmath35 ) , but not insignificant .",
    "if we increase the sample size by adding the upper scorpius members , 6 to the lower and 6 to the higher mass bin , the likelihood that the two mass bins have the same binary distribution becomes even lower ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "in addition , we also note that 4 systems that are outside of the sensitivity range fall in the higher mass bin and thus further reinforce our point",
    ". we can also compare the young vlmo sample with young stars ( @xmath10.57 - 1.40 @xmath26 ) in taurus and cha i surveyed by ghez et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1997 ) in the sensitivity regime outlined in fig .",
    "the result ( likelihood of @xmath37 and @xmath36 if we include or exlude the upper scorpius sample respectively ; table 3 ) bolsters the case for a decreasing wide binary frequency with mass .    what could account for this observed trend ?",
    "one possibility is that less massive , and therefore fainter , primaries will have even fainter companions that might not be detectable by surveys .",
    "however , all of the samples presented here are sensitive to mass ratios of @xmath38 at separations greater than @xmath39 and even lower mass ratios at wider separations ( fig 2 . and fig 4 . ) for the young vlmo sample , allowing us to rule out such a bias .",
    "another possibility is that binary separations ( i.e. , system size ) decreases with mass below our detection limits . a radial velocity survey of cha i vlmos finds only one candidate companion ( joergens 2006 ) at @xmath400.1 au among 10 targets while basri & reiners ( 2006 ) find a spectroscopic binary fraction of @xmath111% in the 0 - 6 au separation range among field vlmos .",
    "imaging surveys of field vlmos ( eg .",
    ", close et al .",
    "2003 , siegler et al .",
    "2005 ) , which have typical sensitivities of @xmath41 at @xmath42 , also do not reveal a significant number of companions closer to the primaries .",
    "thus , it appears unlikely that a decrease in separations is the primary reason for the observed drop in multiplicity in the vlm regime .",
    "instead , we conclude that the binary frequency most likely decreases with mass .",
    "we investigate whether binarity in the vlm regime depends on age by comparing the young vlmo sample with the late m and early l field dwarfs surveyed by close et al .",
    "they found three nearly equal mass @xmath43 pairs wider than @xmath17.5 au among 85 targets in the @xmath10.05 - 0.1 @xmath26 mass range , resulting in a binary fraction of @xmath44 , which is in good agreement with that for young vlmos suggesting that binarity in the vlm regime does not depend strongly on age between a few myr and several gyr .",
    "one concern is that environments from which these two samples are drawn may be different .",
    "the young vlmo sample comes from low density t - associations ( and ob - associations if we choose to include upper scorpius ) , while most of the field objects probably formed in higher density clusters .",
    "thus one can argue that the multiplicity fraction we see today in the surveyed sfrs might decrease over time below that seen in the field .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that this will happen because the field vlmos have survived more dynamically active environments .",
    "we also examine the stability of vlm binaries by calculating their binding energies in comparison to those of other binary populations .",
    "3 shows that even though there is significant overlap of young and field vlm binaries on the binding energy vs. separation plot , young unbound associations also have a significant population of wider binaries .",
    "as this is the population that might be disrupted by dynamical encounters , exploration of stability of such systems is important . regarding this problem",
    ", we note that a number of field star systems ( those in the boxed area of the figure ) are more fragile than the young vlm binaries , even though the former have evolved dynamically already .",
    "this is all the more surprising if one considers the fact that these field systems were most likely born in higher density regions where dynamical evolution would have had a more profound effect .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the `` harder '' vlm binaries , would be disrupted , again supporting the conclusion that age is not a major factor affecting binarity in the vlm regime , at least when one considers ob and t associationsau ) field vlm systems have been discovered ( billres et al . 2005 ; caballero et al . 2007 ;",
    "artigau et al .",
    "these are not included in our analysis as they are not part of a defined sample .",
    "nevertheless , their existence shows that at least some very wide vlm binaries could survive their birth environment . ]",
    "weakly bound binaries can be disrupted by gravitational perturbations from both stellar encounters and giant molecular clouds , as discussed by weinberg et al .",
    "burgasser et al .  ( 2003 ) applied the formalism of weinberg et al .",
    "( 1987 ) to the bd regime , and found that a pair of 0.05@xmath45 bds separated by 10au would be completely impervious to disruption by stellar encounters in the field .",
    "scaling the result of burgasser et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to the most weakly bound system in our combined young vlmo sample , with a total mass of @xmath46 and a separation of @xmath47au , we get expected disruption timescales from field stars that are on the order of 600gyr , more than 10@xmath48 times older than the age of the systems .",
    "these estimates are based on field star densities of @xmath49pc@xmath50 ( bahcall & soneira 1980 ) , which is a critical parameter , as the disruption timescale @xmath51 . but even assuming a stellar density as high as @xmath52pc@xmath50 , corresponding to the outer regions of the orion nebula cluster ( khler et al .",
    "2006 ) , the disruption timescale would be 150myr , two orders of magnitude longer than the present age of the system . this estimate suggests that encounters with other stars do not disrupt even the most weakly bound systems in our sample , either in their birth environments ( i.e. , in ob or t associations ) or later as the stellar densities drop to match that in the field .",
    "since perturbations from giant molecular clouds are insignificant in comparison to stellar encounters ( burgasser et al . 2003 ) , the vlm binaries in our sample are likely to survive almost indefinitely .      in recent years",
    ", several vlm systems that appear to diverge from established trends have been reported .",
    "in particular very wide systems such as oph162225 - 240515 with ultra low mass companions stand out from field vlm systems whose separation tends to decrease with mass . because the presence of such systems imposes additional constraints on formation mechanisms , it is important to determine their frequency .",
    "5 shows that our survey is sensitive to nearly planetary mass companions ( down to 9m@xmath53 ) around 23 targets in the cha i sample at separations greater than @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , such systems could be detected around all 34 targets from the kraus et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) surveys of upper scorpius and taurus . yet , no ultra low mass companions at wide separations are detected in these three surveys , giving a frequency of no more than 2% and thus confirming their rarity .",
    "since the typical primary mass of the combined vlmo sample is 110m@xmath53 , and the imaging surveys are sensitive to @xmath55 companions ( i.e. , secondaries with 915m@xmath53 ) at @xmath56 , we can also compare our results to surveys for sub - stellar companions to solar analogs .",
    "for example , metchev & hillenbrand ( 2005 ) targeted 100 f5-k5 primaries to look for brown dwarf companions .",
    "based on a single detection , they derive a sub - stellar companion freqency of at least @xmath57 , and possibly on the order of a few percent .",
    "this result is in statistical agreement with the frequency of @xmath55 systems around vlm primaries in our combined young sample .",
    "therefore , even though vlm systems with planetary mass companions are rare , the frequency of @xmath55 binaries in the vlm regime is no different from that for solar - type stars .",
    "our survey of vlmos in chamaeleon  i lends additional support to the established trend for a lower binary frequency with decreasing primary mass . by comparing the multiplicity properties of young vlmos with those of field vlmos and stars , we conclude that there is likely no evolution of multiplicity after the first fewmyr for objects formed in low density regions .    while our survey of cha i and the surveys of kraus et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) and konopacky et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show that wide vlm systems with ultra - low - mass companions  thought to be a critical challange to the ejection formation mechanism  are infrequent , they also reveal a significant fraction of systems considered wide by the ejection scenario ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "seven out of thirteen reported systems have separations wider than @xmath59 , with three systems separated by more than @xmath24 .",
    "bate et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have recently reported that their simulations can produce binaries wider than the initial @xmath59 limit , albeit via a different mechanism than the one responsible for the production of tighter pairs ( i.e. , simultaneous ejection and capture of previously unassociated objects vs. ejection of coupled tight binaries ) . however , since their hydrodynamic simulations are not followed up with n - body calculations , it is difficult to make a direct comparison ; many of the reported simulated binaries are still accreting and likely unstable and the statistics are still somewhat limited ; there may also be a spread in the ages of objects in a given sfr .",
    "in addition , most simulations model higher density regions , more akin to the orion nebula cluster rather than the diffuse t associations that we and other observers have surveyed mostly .",

    "<S> characterizing multiplicity in the very low mass ( vlm ) domain is a topic of much current interest and fundamental importance . </S>",
    "<S> here we report on a near - infrared adaptive optics imaging survey of 31 young brown dwarfs and vlm stars , 28 of which are in the chamaeleon i star - forming region , using the eso very large telescope . </S>",
    "<S> our survey is sensitive enough to detect equal mass binaries down to separations of 0.040.07@xmath0 ( @xmath1610 au at 160 pc ) and , typically , companions with mass ratios ( @xmath2 ) as low as 0.2 outside of 0.2@xmath0 ( @xmath130 au ) . </S>",
    "<S> we resolve the suspected 0.16@xmath0 ( @xmath126 au ) binary chah@xmath3 2 and present two new binaries , hn 13 and chxr 15 , with separations of 0.13@xmath0 ( @xmath1 20 au ) and 0.30@xmath0 ( @xmath1 50 au ) respectively ; the latter system is one of the widest vlm systems discovered to date . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find companions around the majority of our targets giving an overall binary frequency of @xmath4 , thus confirming the trend for a lower binary frequency with decreasing mass . by combining our work with previous surveys of vlm objects ( vlmos ) in other star forming regions , </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at the largest sample of young vlmos ( 72 ) with high angular resolution imaging to date . </S>",
    "<S> its multiplicity fraction is in statistical agreement with that for vlmos in the field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we note that many field stellar binaries with lower binding energies and/or wider cross sections have survived dynamical evolution and that statistical models suggest tidal disruption by passing stars is unlikely to affect the binary properties of our systems . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we argue that there is no significant evolution of multiplicity with age among brown dwarfs and vlm stars in ob and t associations between a few myr to several gyr . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the observations to date suggest that vlm objects are either less likely to be born in fragile multiple systems than solar mass stars or such systems are disrupted very early ( within the first couple of myr ) . </S>"
