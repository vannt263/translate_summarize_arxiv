    "the nature of dark matter is one of the most intriguing questions of particle astrophysics .",
    "its resolution would have a profound impact on the development of particle physics beyond the standard model .",
    "although the possibility of having massive compact halo objects ( machos ) as a dominant form of dm is still under debate ( see recent discussion in  @xcite and references therein ) , it is widely believed that dark matter is composed of non - baryonic particles .",
    "however , the standard model of elementary particles does not contain a viable dark matter particle candidate  a massive , neutral and long - lived particle .",
    "active neutrinos , which are both neutral and stable , form structures in a top - down fashion  @xcite , and thus can not produce the observed quantity of early - type galaxies  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the dm particle hypothesis implies the extension of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the dm particle candidates may have very different masses ( for reviews of dm candidates see e.g.  @xcite ) : massive gravitons with the mass @xmath2  @xcite , axions with the mass @xmath3  @xcite , sterile neutrinos having mass in the kev range  @xcite , sypersymmetric ( susy ) particles ( gravitinos  @xcite , neutralinos  @xcite , axinos  @xcite with their masses ranging from ev to hundreds gev , supersymmetric q - balls  @xcite , wimpzillas with the mass @xmath4  @xcite , and many others ) .",
    "thus , the mass of dm particles becomes an important characteristic which may help to distinguish between various dm candidates and , more importantly , may help to differentiate among different models beyond the sm .",
    "it was suggested in  @xcite that quite a robust and model - independent _ lower bound _ on the mass of dm particles can be obtained by considering phase space density evolution of compact astrophysical objects , most notably dwarf spheroidal satellites ( dsphs ) of the milky ways .",
    "the idea was developed further in a number of works ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "another way to distinguish between various dm models , and particularly to put a bound on the dm mass , is the analysis of the lyman-@xmath5 ( ly-@xmath5 ) forest data  @xcite .",
    "  at different redshifts in the spectra of distant quasars .",
    "] this method essentially constrains the possible shape of the power spectrum of density fluctuations at comoving scales @xmath6mpc . assuming _ a dm model _ , ( i.e. a particular primordial velocity distribution of dm particles ) , one can obtain a relationship between the dm particle mass _ in this model _ and the shape of the power spectrum , probed by ly-@xmath5 .",
    "although very promising , the ly-@xmath5 method is very complicated and indirect .",
    "first of all , under the assumption that the distribution of the neutral hydrogen traces that of the dm , one can reconstruct the power spectrum of density fluctuations at redshifts @xmath7 from the statistics of lyman-@xmath5 absorption lines .",
    "one can then perform a fit of the lyman-@xmath5 data ( often together with the measurements of anisotropy of temperature of cosmic microwave background and the data of large - scale structure surveys ) , to extract the information about cosmological models .",
    "this is usually done by using the monte - carlo markov chain technique  @xcite . at redshifts probed by ly-@xmath5",
    ", the evolution of structure has already entered the ( mildly ) non - linear stage .",
    "therefore , to properly relate the measured power spectrum with the parameters of a given cosmological model one would have to perform a prohibitively large number of hydrodynamic numerical simulations . therefore ,",
    "various simplifying approximations have to be realized  @xcite .",
    "apart from these computational difficulties , the physics entering the ly-@xmath5analysis is complicated , and not yet fully understood  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . moreover , the dm particles can significantly influence the background physics , further complicating the ly-@xmath5 analysis  @xcite .",
    "for a recent overview of the ly-@xmath5method see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainties associated with both computational difficulties and complicated physics of ly-@xmath5systems are not fully explored .",
    "therefore , _ it is very important to have a lower mass bound on dm particles from more direct and simple considerations_. in this paper we discuss the tremaine - gunn and related dm mass bounds based on the phase - space density considerations as well as possible ways to strengthen them for several dm models .",
    "the obtained phase - space density bounds are weaker yet comparable with ly-@xmath5 bounds and therefore provide an interesting alternative .",
    "we consider a class of the so - called `` generic '' dm models , where dm particles are produced thermally and decouple while being relativistic , thus having the ( relativistic ) fermi - dirac momentum spectrum .",
    "we also consider models of non - thermal dm production . in this case",
    "the primordial velocity spectrum of dm particles depends on the details of the production mechanism .",
    "we analyze the case when the velocity spectrum can be approximated by the _ rescaled _ fermi - dirac spectrum , or has two such components ( a colder and a warmer one ) .",
    "a very important example of such a dm particle is the _ sterile _ ( right - handed ) neutrino . although known as a dm candidate for some 15 years  @xcite ,",
    "recently sterile neutrinos have attracted a lot of attention .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that if one adds three right - handed ( sterile ) neutrinos to the standard model , it is possible to explain simultaneously the data on neutrino oscillations ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) and the dark matter in the universe , without introducing any new physics _ above electro - weak scale _ @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , if the masses of two of these particles are between @xmath9 and electro - weak scale and are almost degenerate , it is also possible  @xcite to generate the correct baryon asymmetry of the universe ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the third ( lightest ) sterile neutrino can have mass in kev - mev range sterile neutrinos ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . ] and be coupled to the rest of the matter weakly enough to provide a viable ( _ cold _ or _ warm ) _ dm candidate .",
    "this theory , explaining the three observed phenomena `` beyond the sm '' within one consistent framework , is called the _ @xmath1msm _",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "although weakly coupled , the dm sterile neutrino in the @xmath1msm can be produced in the correct quanities to account for all of the dm .",
    "there are several mechanisms of production : non - resonant active - sterile neutrino oscillations ( * _ non - resonant production _ * mechanism , * nrp * )  @xcite , resonant active - sterile neutrino oscillations in the presence of lepton asymmetry ( * _ resonant production _ * mechanism , * rp * )  @xcite , decay of the gauge - singlet scalar field  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the ly-@xmath5analysis of the sterile neutrino dm , produced via nrp scenario was performed in a number of works  @xcite .",
    "these bounds were recently revisited in  @xcite , using the sdss ly-@xmath5 dataset together with wmap5  @xcite .",
    "the lower bound on the dm mass was found to be in this case @xmath10 ( at @xmath11  cl ) . ref .",
    "@xcite also analyzed a more general case cwdm case : a mixture of nrp sterile neutrino with cold dm ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "these results were applied to the rp produced sterile neutrino in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the mass as low as @xmath12 is compatible with ly-@xmath5data .    in this paper",
    "we will analyze in detail restrictions on the sterile neutrinos , produced via first two production mechanisms and briefly comment on the third one in the discussion . in the case of non - resonant production",
    "the primordial velocity spectrum is approximately _ proportional _ to the fermi - dirac distribution  @xcite ( the exact spectrum was calculated in  @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : overview ]",
    "we review dm mass bounds , based on the phase - space density arguments . in section  [ sec : maxim - coarse - grain ] we introduce the concept of maximal coarse - graining and propose a conservative modification of the original tremaine - gunn bound . in section  [ sec : analys - meas - valu ] we analyze new observational data on recently discovered dsphs ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , and use it to determine the phase - space density of these objects .",
    "special attention is paid to determine various systematic uncertainties of measured values .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ sec : bounds ] .",
    "we conclude with the discussion of the results , analysis of possible uncertainties and outlook for the further improvement of the mass bounds in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "if the dm particles are fermions , there is a very robust bound on their mass .",
    "namely , due to the pauli exclusion principle , there exists the densest `` packing '' of the fermions in a given region of the phase space . decreasing the mass of dm particles ,",
    "one increases the number of them in a given gravitationally bound object , containing dm .",
    "the requirement that the phase - space density of the dm does not exceed that of the degenerate fermi gas leads to the _ lower mass bound_. for example , for a spherically symmetric dm - dominated object with the mass @xmath13 within the region @xmath14 , one obtains the lower bound @xmath15 on the dm mass by demanding that the maximal ( fermi ) velocity of the degenerate fermionic gravitating gas of mass @xmath13 in the volume @xmath16 does not exceed the escape velocity @xmath17 : @xmath18 here and below @xmath19 denotes the number of internal degrees of freedom of dm particles , and @xmath20 is the newton s constant .",
    "such a consideration , applied to various dm dominated objects , leads to the mass bound , which we will call @xmath15 in what follows ( see table  [ tab : gilmore ] below ) .",
    "the above considerations assume that the dsphs are _ purely spherical _ systems .",
    "analysis of  @xcite shows that ellipticity of stars in dsphs vary from @xmath21 for leo iv to @xmath22 for ursa major i. simulated dm halos on the other hand tend to have rather moderate ellipticity , @xmath23 @xcite . according to appendix  [ app : aspher ] , the ellipticity of dm halos can lower the resulting limit on @xmath15 by @xmath24 10% .",
    "the limit , obtained in such a way , is very robust , as it is independent of the details of the formation history of the system .",
    "the only uncertainties associated with it are those of astronomical nature : systematic errors in the determination of velocity and density distribution .",
    "all these issues will be discussed below ( section  [ sec : analys - meas - valu ] ,  [ sec : maxim - coarse - grain ] ) .    for particular dm models ( with the known primordial velocity dispersion ) and under certain assumptions about the evolution of the system which led to the observed final state , this limit can be strengthened  @xcite .",
    "the argument is based on the _ liouville s theorem _  ( see e.g. @xcite ) and assumes that the collapse of the system is disipationless and collisionless .",
    "the liouville theorem states that the phase - space distribution function @xmath25 does not change in the course of disipationless collisionless dynamics .",
    "the consequence of the liouville theorem is that the function @xmath25 `` moves '' in the phase - space , according to the hamiltonian flow , and therefore its maximum ( over the phase space ) remains unchanged .",
    "therefore , if one could determine the characteristics of a phase - space distribution function from astronomically observed quantities ( in the first place average density @xmath26 and velocity dispersion @xmath27 ) along the line of sight .",
    "we will denote such a projection by @xmath28 to distinguish it from the absolute value of the 3d velocity @xmath29 .",
    "the 1d velocity dispersion is defined as @xmath30 and is in principle the function of the projected radius @xmath14 .",
    "however in the dm dominated objects , for @xmath14 greater than certain characteristic scale rotation curve flattens , @xmath31 .",
    "it is this constant which is usually referred to as `` velocity dispersion '' . ] in dsphs ( or any other dm dominated objects ) , the liouville theorem would allow to connect the measured values with the primordial properties of dm particles .",
    "one such characteristics of the phase - space distribution is its _ maximum_. any physical measurement can probe only the phase - space distribution , averaged over some phase - space region  a _ coarse - grained _ phase - space density ( psd ) ( as opposed to exact or _ fine - grained _ psd ) .",
    "such a coarse - grained psd , averaged over phase - space cells @xmath32 centered around points @xmath33 in the phase space , is defined via @xmath34 ( here @xmath35 is the volume of the phase - space cell ) . from the definition ( [ eq:32 ] )",
    "it is clear that the maximal ( over the whole phase space ) value of the coarse - grained psd @xmath36 can not exceed the maximal value of the corresponding fine - grained psd . on the other hand , as a consequence of the liouville theorem ,",
    "the maximum of the fine - grained psd @xmath37 does not change in time .",
    "thus , one arrives to the following inequality @xmath38 the inequality  ( [ ff ] ) allows to relate the properties of dm at present time @xmath39 with its primordial properties , encoded in @xmath37 . for example , if one assumes that initially dm particles possess relativistic fermi - dirac distribution function with some temperature @xmath40 ( relativistically decoupled thermal relics ) : @xmath41 and recovers from astronomical measurements that in the final state the coarse - grained psd of the system is described by the isothermal sphere ( see e.g.  @xcite ) with a core radius @xmath42 and a 1d velocity dispersion @xmath27 , whose maximum is given by @xmath43 the comparison of the maximum of the coarse - grained psd  ( [ eq:4 ] ) with its primordial ( fine - grained ) value leads to the so - called tremaine - gunn mass bound  @xcite : @xmath44 for the case of initial distribution  ( [ eq:3 ] ) this bound is stronger than the one , based on the pauli exclusion principle , by a factor @xmath45  @xcite . for different primordial dm distributions",
    "this difference can be significant ( as we will demonstrate later ) .",
    "we would like to stress , though , that these stronger bounds make assumptions about the evolution of phase - space density , while the one , based on the pauli exclusion principle does not assume anything about either primordial velocity distribution of the particles , or the formation history of the observed object and simply compares measured phase - space density with the maximally allowed for fermions .",
    "another characteristics of the phase - space distribution function is the `` average phase - space density ''",
    "@xmath46 introduced in @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath47 ( average psd today ) is simply defined in terms of the observed quantities @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath48 and therefore serves as a convenient estimator of the psd for any dm dominated object . one can calculate primordial @xmath49 for an arbitrary homogeneous distribution function @xmath50 @xmath51 and compare it with its value today @xmath52 .",
    "it was claimed in  @xcite that @xmath53 can not increase during the evolution of dm : @xmath54 applying this inequality to the dsphs , one obtains several times stronger mass bound , than that of  @xcite .    to illustrate the origin of the inequality  ( [ eq:59 ] ) , authors of  @xcite noticed that in the case of the _ uniform monoatomic ideal gas _ , @xmath53 is related to the usual thermodynamic entropy per particle ( see appendix  [ sec : ideal - boltzmann - gas ] ) and the inequality for @xmath53 becomes a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "indeed , in this case one can see that @xmath55}{n } =    -\\log\\left(\\frac{{{q}}(\\bar\\rho,\\sigma)\\hbar^3}{m^{4}}\\right ) + \\log    c[f]\\ ; ,    \\label{cq_corr}\\ ] ] where in the right hand side of  ( [ cq_corr ] ) functional @xmath56 $ ] does not depend on the average density and velocity of the dm particles .",
    "however , because of the long - range interaction of dm particles , the notion of boltzmann entropy is well - defined only for the primordial dm distribution and not for the final state of dm evolution ( see e.g. the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we will show below that in general _ the increase of entropy does not imply the decrease of _ @xmath57 . indeed ,",
    "the values of @xmath56 $ ] are different for different types of phase - space distributions @xmath58 and therefore they can change with time if the shape of the ( coarse - grained ) distribution changes .",
    "namely , even if initial ( @xmath59 ) and final ( @xmath58 ) states both satisfy relation  ( [ cq_corr ] ) between the entropy and @xmath53 ( @xmath60 ) from the second law of thermodynamics @xmath61 it only follows that @xmath62 therefore , in general , the inequality  ( [ eq:59 ] ) does not follow from entropic considerations .    moreover",
    ", the simple relation  ( [ cq_corr ] ) between the entropy and @xmath53 does not hold for the distributions we are interested in .",
    "for example , for the fermi - dirac distribution  ( [ eq:3 ] ) one has : @xmath63 ( see appendix  [ sec : dw ] for details ) .",
    "the relation becomes even more complicated , if one considers dm candidates ( e.g. , sterile neutrinos , gravitinos ) , which are produced out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "in general , when the primordial distribution function depends on several parameters , both @xmath53 and entropy are expressed through these parameters in a non - trivial way and the simple relation  ( [ cq_corr ] ) does not hold .",
    "for example , this is the case when dm is produces in two stages and the dm distribution shape has two components : colder and warmer one .",
    "physically interesting examples include : production of sterile neutrino in the presence of lepton asymmetry  @xcite ; production of gravitino thermally at high temperatures ( see e.g.  @xcite ) accompanied by non - thermal production via late decays of next - to - lightest supersymmetric particles  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    keeping in mind the above considerations , one might be tempted to use the entropy of the system as an estimator of psd and utilize the entropy increase  ( [ eq:12 ] ) instead of the inequality on @xmath53 to put a lower bound on the dm mass .",
    "however , unlike @xmath53 , which by definition is expressed solely in terms of measured quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the inequality  ( [ eq:12 ] ) requires the knowledge of the phase - space distribution function in the final state ( e.g. to determine the @xmath64 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cq_corr ] ) or , more generally to express the entropy of the final state in terms of the observed quantities ) .",
    "this information can not be simply deduced from astronomical observations .",
    "one possible way to formulate a conservative , robust inequality would be to find the _ maximal _",
    "possible entropy for a given system with measured macroscopic parameters .",
    "however , it was shown in  @xcite that such a maximum does not exist .",
    "namely , for a gravitating system which usually consists of a compact core and a widely dispersed halo of finite mass , the total boltzmann entropy of the system goes to infinity when the halo becomes infinite .",
    "physically , the measured density and velocity dispersion characterize the inner part of the object .",
    "the astronomical observations do not usually probe the outskirts of gravitating systems ( such as dsphs ) and phase - space distributions ( such as ( [ eq:4 ] ) ) do not describe them properly . on the other hand , to compare with the homogenous initial system having a primordial velocity spectrum ,",
    "we need to know an entropy of the _ whole _ system .",
    "the large ( and unknown ! )",
    "fraction of this entropy can be related to the outskirts .",
    "the entropy of the gravitating system depends on the precise state of the halo .    as a result ,",
    "it is not possible to construct a simple and robust limit , using entropy considerations .",
    "in view of the above arguments , to derive a conservative mass bound , in this work we will follow the original approach of tremaine and gunn  @xcite with some modification .",
    "an important advantage of this approach is that the maximum of the phase space density is likely to be located in the inner , dense part of an object .",
    "therefore , under this reasonable assumption , the results _ do not depend _ on the dm distribution in the outskirts ( see the discussion above ) .    as discussed already , the coarse - grained phase - space distribution in the final state can not be measured directly , and one has to make assumptions to deduce its maximum . a conservative way to minimize",
    "this uncertainty is to use the `` maximally coarse - grained distribution '' .",
    "it is based on a simple fact that the mean value of a function , averaged over an arbitrary region can not exceed its maximal value .",
    "therefore , the average value of coarse - grained phase space density in a large phase - space volume can be taken as a conservative estimate of the @xmath65 , independent on assumptions about the actual form of phase - space distribution .    to this end",
    "we consider an ( approximately spherically symmetric ) gravitating system ( having in mind a dwarf spheroidal galaxy ) , that has the mass @xmath66 confined within the radius @xmath14 .",
    "the phase - space volume , occupied by the dm particles , forming such a system can be approximated by @xmath67 where we have introduced _ escape velocity _ @xmath68 .",
    "the `` coarsest '' psd is such that the averaging  ( [ eq:32 ] ) goes over the whole phase - space volume : @xmath69 : @xmath70 as an estimate for @xmath14 we take _ half - light radius",
    "_ @xmath71 ( i.e. the radius where surface brightness profile falls to 1/2 of its maximal value ) . neglecting possible influence of ellipticity of stellar orbits ( c.f .",
    "appendix  [ app : aspher ] ) , assuming constant dm density within @xmath71 and isothermal distribution of stars  @xcite , we obtain the following estimate on the average dm density within @xmath71 : @xmath72 assuming isotropic velocity distributions , tends to be zero towards the central region  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether @xmath73 equals to zero for stars in dsphs .",
    "the assumption of isotropy of stellar velocities leads to the _ cored _ density profiles  @xcite , therefore our estimate for @xmath26 tends to be robust .",
    "this is confirmed by comparison of the estimate  ( [ eq:60 ] ) with those , based on  @xcite , where dm density profiles were obtained under the assumptions of different anisotropic distributions of stars in dsphs . ]",
    "the escape velocity @xmath74 of the dm particles is related to the velocity dispersion @xmath27 via @xmath75 .",
    "in such a way we obtain the averaged psd @xmath76 : @xmath77 which coincides with its maximal value ( being flat ) . as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) , this `` coarse - grained '' psd @xmath76 is smaller than the @xmath37  the maximum value of fine - grained psd , equal to its primordial value : @xmath78 eq .",
    "( [ ineq1 ] ) relates the observed properties of the dm - dominated systems ( l.h.s . ) with the microscopic quantity on the r.h.s . of inequality , which depends on the production mechanism of the dm .",
    "in this paper we are mostly interested in two types of primordial momentum distribution .",
    "one is the relativistic fermi - dirac  ( [ eq:3 ] ) with its @xmath37 being equal to @xmath79 ( we fix the overall normalization of the phase - space distribution function by the relation @xmath80 , where @xmath13 is the total mass of the system ) .",
    "another one is an ( approximate ) form of the momentum distribution for sterile neutrinos , produced via non - resonant oscillations with the active ones  @xcite .",
    "for the latter case we consider the velocity dispersion to be ) does not exceed 20% , which does not affect the mass bounds . ] @xmath81 the normalization constant @xmath82 is proportional to the mixing strength between active and sterile neutrinos and @xmath83 is the temperature of neutrino background @xmath84 , related to the temperature of the cmb background today via @xmath85 .",
    "for the maximal value of distribution  ( [ eq:10 ] ) we find @xmath86 from the definition  ( [ eq:10 ] ) one can relate the normalization factor @xmath87 to the dm abundance ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath88}{94{\\:\\mathrm{ev}}}.    \\label{chi}\\ ] ] therefore we can rewrite maximal value of the primordial phase - space density  ( [ chi ] ) as @xmath89 notice , that unlike the fermi - dirac case , for the nrp scenario @xmath37 behaves as the _ third _ power of particle s mass .    in the presence of lepton asymmetry in primeval plasma the resonant production of sterile neutrinos becomes possible  @xcite .",
    "a possible lepton asymmetry , generated in the framework of the @xmath1msmand spectra of sterile neutrino dm were recently computed in  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , these spectra contain a `` cold '' ( resonant ) component and a `` warm '' one , produced through non - resonant oscillations , analogously to the nrp scenario of  @xcite .",
    "the spectra as a whole become colder than in the nrp case ( see e.g.  fig .  6 in @xcite ) . the maxima of primordial phase - space distributions for these spectra are higher ( sometimes significantly ) than for spectra , produced in the nrp scenario ( c.f . fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in general mass bound for such a dm is expected to be weaker than that of the nrp scenario .",
    "the exact form of these spectra can be computed only numerically .",
    "we used a number of spectra to check those which satisfy the bound  ( [ ineq1 ] ) or tg bound ( see section  [ sec : bounds ] ) .",
    "let us compare expression  ( [ eq:38 ] ) with the original tremaine - gunn bound ( maximum of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) ) : @xmath90 the values of @xmath76 is smaller than @xmath91 by @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath71 are the core radius of isothermal profile and the half - light radius , correspondingly .",
    "when comparing @xmath76 and @xmath91 below , we take @xmath94 .",
    "essentially , the difference between @xmath76 and @xmath91 is due to the different assumed velocity distributions . while the maxwell distribution was assumed in  @xcite ( c.f",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) ) , we assume constant velocity profile from escape velocity @xmath74 down to @xmath95 ( as shown on the fig .  [",
    "fig : velocities ] ) .",
    "the numerical factor in  ( [ eq:21 ] ) is the ratio of areas under two velocity curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : velocities ] .",
    "translated into the mass bound , relation  ( [ eq:21 ] ) means that for dm particles with distribution  ( [ eq:3 ] ) one would obtain roughly 40% stronger mass bound by using the original tremaine - gunn bound , rather than @xmath76 ( and @xmath96 stronger mass bound for the case of the distribution  ( [ eq:10 ] ) ) .",
    "let us compare our new bound with the one , based of @xcite .",
    "following the definition  ( [ eq:2 ] ) , we express the measured value @xmath52 for a dsph through the observed quantities @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the scaling factor which accounts for the fact that the dark matter particles do not necessarily have the same velocity dispersion as the stars , @xmath99 is the half - light radius , @xmath27 is the measured one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the stars and @xmath26 is defined in  ( [ eq:60 ] ) .",

    "based on the original tremaine - gunn bound , @xmath145 is also ruled out for sufficiently high ( @xmath146 ) lepton asymmetries .",
    "thus , resonantly produced sterile neutrinos remain a viable dm candidate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sf - window ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to notice that our bounds  ( [ eq:27])([eq:30 ] ) are valid under the assumption that the influence of the baryons does not result in the _ increase _ of the psd in the course of structure formation .",
    "if this assumption does not hold , only the bound  ( [ eq:28 ] ) remains intact .    in this work we chose not to use the bound , based on the `` average psd '' q  @xcite ( see discussion in the section  [ sec : overview ] ) .",
    "however , as this bound is widely used in the literature , we quote analogs of lower limits  ( [ eq:27 ] ) and  ( [ eq:29 ] ) based on inequality  ( [ eq:59 ] ) ( which we denote @xmath147 and @xmath148 correspondingly ) : @xmath149 for details see appendix  [ sec : hd ] .",
    "in this paper we suggested that a conservative way to put the bound on a dm particle mass may be based on the requirements that the maximum of the observed coarse - grained phase space density should not exceed the maximum of the initial distribution function of the dm particles .",
    "the maximum of the coarse - graned distribution function in the final state may be conservatively estimated from the observed quantities .",
    "this bound relies on the assumption that the maximum of the distribution function was not significantly increased by the interaction with baryons .",
    "although dm consists of the non - interacting particles , the remaining part of the galaxy  the baryons  interact with one another and dissipate their energy , finally concentrating towards the center .",
    "the baryons , which are condensed in the center , influence the shape of dm halo gravitationally , increasing the central dm density  @xcite .",
    "the opposite effect is the energy feedback from snae , galactic winds and reionization , which creates the strong outflow , significantly decreasing the mass of the gas and thereby affecting the dm halo shape .",
    "such a feedback is thought to be responsible to the formation of dwarf spheroidals from gas - rich dwarf spiral / irregular galaxies  @xcite .",
    "clearly both gas condensation and feedback strongly influence the central psd of dm  @xcite , and in principle can lead to the violation of the inequality ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "numerical studies of galaxy mergers show that baryons can lead to the increase of the phase - space density during the merger ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the method used in this work  coarse - graining of the psd over a large phase - space region  reduces the influence of baryons .",
    "indeed , we take the spatial averaging over the radius @xmath150 , which includes external part of the system , where the amount of baryons is small .",
    "additional studies are necessary to estimate effects of baryons and make our bounds more robust .",
    "we plan to address these issues elsewhere .",
    "we would also like to stress that the initial velocities of dm particles in our approach are _ thermal _ velocities and they should not be confused with the so - called _ zeldovich _ velocities  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of galaxy formation do not start at the time , when the dm phase - space distribution is spatially uniform ( redshifts @xmath151 ) .",
    "instead , the initial ( linear ) stage of the structure formation is computed analytically in the framework of the so - called _ zeldovich approximation _  @xcite .",
    "this approximation is commonly used to set up initial conditions for the numerical simulations of non - linear stage of structure formation  @xcite , which start at redshifts @xmath152 .",
    "the peculiar ( _ zeldovich _ ) velocities acquired by dm particles at this stage due to structure formation and included into the initial conditions are normally @xmath153 .",
    "apart from zeldovich velocities , dm particles also possess thermal velocities , which are discussed in this paper . for cold enough dark matter",
    "these thermal velocities are much smaller than zeldovich ones and , thus , are often neglected and not included into initial conditions .",
    "therefore , the numerical studies of psd evolution as a psd estimator ] ( see e.g.  @xcite ) essentially investigate the change of psd from zeldovich to final stage .",
    "it was found in some of these works that the psd changes by @xmath154 in the process of collapse  @xcite .",
    "this change of psd can be understood as being simply an evolution from initial zeldovich velocities @xmath155 to the final ( virial ) ones @xmath156 ( with @xmath157 ) .    because initial thermal velocities may be much smaller than zeldovich ones , initial",
    "psd may differ from the final ( observed ) psd not by 23 , but by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this fact does not contradict to the results of simulations , described in e.g.  @xcite and , therefore , can not be used to obtain an _",
    "upper _ bound on the mass of dm particles ( c.f  @xcite ) .",
    "this work was mostly concentrated on restrictions on the mass of the sterile neutrino dm , produced in through the non - resonant oscillations with active neutrino ( nrp scenario ) .",
    "we see that our results ( section  [ sec : bounds ] ) strongly disfavor such sterile neutrinos as the single dm component .",
    "this conclusion is not based on the ly-@xmath5method and therefore is not subject to its uncertainties ( discussed in the introduction ) .",
    "however , several uncertainties can affect this conclusion , the major being baryonic feedback .",
    "to make this result really robust , apart from further modeling of the baryonic influence , one needs to strengthen the tension between upper and lower mass bounds discussed in this paper .",
    "this is plausible and may be done either by improving the x - ray bounds with new observations or by strengthening the psd consideration , which is in the first place related to better measurements of kinematics of dsphs .    in the presence of lepton asymmetry ,",
    "the resonant production ( rp ) of sterile neutrino dm takes place  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is more efficient  @xcite than the nrp scenario and allows to achieve required dm abundance for weaker mixings ( c.f .",
    "fig .  4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "this lifts the upper bound on the dm particle mass in this scenario up to @xmath158  kev . at the same time , for the same mass the primordial velocity distribution of rp sterile neutrino dm is colder than in nrp one .",
    "this @xmath37 is as much as the order of magnitude bigger than  ( [ eq:16 ] ) ( c.f .",
    "this brings down by a factor @xmath159 the analog of the mass bound  ( [ eq:29 ] ) . analyzing available spectra for a range of lepton asymmetries",
    ", we see that models with @xmath160 are allowed .",
    "thus , there is a large open `` window '' of allowed dm masses ( c.f .",
    "fig.[fig : sf - window ] ) .",
    "however , as the dependence of the velocity spectrum on the lepton assymetry is not monotonic , to obtain the exact shape of the lower bound on the mass at given mixing angle more work is needed .",
    "nevertheless , our results show that the sterile neutrinos , produced in the presence of lepton asymmetry , are viable dm candidates , allowed by all current bounds .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the mechanism of production of sterile neutrinos from decay of massive scalar field , for example the inflaton  @xcite ( for other models see  @xcite ) . the primordial phase - space distribution function for this case",
    "was computed e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "maximal value of phase - space density for this distribution is that of degenerate fermi gas .",
    "notice that the distribution functions in  @xcite @xmath50 is formally unbounded for small momenta : @xmath161 . from this",
    "one can easily find that the fraction of particles , having maximal phase - space density , is @xmath162 . as only this small fraction of all particles has maximal phase - space density , we expect the mass bound in this case to be stronger than  ( [ eq:28 ] ) . the detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere .",

    "the maximal phase - space volume changes in the oblate case by @xmath184 , so the correction for @xmath15 will constitute about 8% for @xmath185 .",
