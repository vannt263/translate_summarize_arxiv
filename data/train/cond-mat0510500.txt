    "in this review we discuss the penetration of magnetic flux in thin type - ii superconducting slabs subject to an increasing magnetic field oriented normal to the slab . in type - ii superconductors ,",
    "magnetic flux penetrates in the form of vortices , which behave as repulsive particles moving in the plane of the slab .",
    "the vortices can only enter ( or leave ) at the edge of the slab .",
    "their motion , however , is hindered by pinning ( due to disorder in the sample ) , which leads to a gradient in vortex density , somewhat similar to the slope of a sand pile , see fig .",
    "this analogy was already noted a long time ago by de gennes@xcite . in the present paper , however , this analogy is extended to the surface roughness of the pile and to the avalanches occurring on its surface .",
    "[ t ]    fig1.ps    the growth and roughness exponents of this rough surface are determined . also",
    "the properties of the avalanches occurring on the surface are measured and it will be shown that they have a power law size distribution function and obey `` finite size scaling '' .",
    "in addition , we find that exponent scaling relations of paczuski , maslov and bak@xcite are obeyed to reasonable accuracy .",
    "all these observations together make a strong case for the vortex pile system to belong to the class of self - organized criticality ( soc)@xcite systems .",
    "to investigate the role of disorder , we also study thin films of niobium , which are slowly subjected to a hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "hydrogen is absorbed by niobium and locally destroys the superconductivity , thus increasing the amount of disorder .",
    "we find that a minimum amount of disorder is necessary for soc to occur . in other superconductors ,",
    "the properties of huge thermo - magnetic avalanches are studied .",
    "these are described very nicely by a recently developed model@xcite and can be simulated to high degree of correspondence .",
    "images of the 2-dimensional ( i.e. in the plane of the thin film sample ) density of vortices are made using a magneto - optical technique@xcite .",
    "on top of the sample and in immediate contact with it , a mirror layer and ( directly above this ) a 4 @xmath0 thick yttrium iron garnet film with large faraday effect are placed .",
    "the sample assembly is placed on a custom built insert with @xmath1-controls for proper alignment , which fits in a commercial @xmath2 or @xmath3 oxford instruments cryostat .",
    "the insert is equipped with lenses , a semi - transparent mirror and polarizers , making it effectively a polarization microscope . where ever there is a local magnetic field in the sample , the incoming polarization vector is turned , thereby increasing the detected intensity .",
    "thus the intensity in the camera yields directly the magnetic field and hence vortex density for each position in the sample . using a modulation scheme@xcite",
    "this intensity map becomes linear in field and much more sensitive .",
    "as mentioned above , the vortex density map of the sample is generally not smooth ( see fig . [ heap ] ) but displays some roughness .",
    "for example , one may define a flux front as the ` foot ' of the vortex ` mountain ' as indicated by the white line in fig .",
    "the exact position is determined by the cross section between the vortex ` mountain ' and a horizontal plane at a level of 3 times the noise in the vortex - free region .",
    "generally@xcite , for such fronts , the r.m.s .",
    "width @xmath4 growths initially with time as @xmath5 . after some time @xmath6 ,",
    "however , lateral correlations extend over the whole area of the pile and @xmath4 does not increase anymore : it is limited to a pile - size dependent value @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the linear size of the pile and @xmath9 is the roughness exponent . at @xmath6 ,",
    "both relations hold from which@xmath10    to find @xmath9 and @xmath11 to higher accuracy , we use the correlation function@xcite@xmath12   ^{2}\\right\\rangle _ { \\xi,\\tau}\\right\\ }   ^{1/2}%\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the height of the interface at position @xmath15 and time @xmath16 , where @xmath17   } $ ] and @xmath18 denotes an average over @xmath19 . from this correlation function ,",
    "one determines the growth exponent @xmath11 and roughness exponent @xmath9 using@xcite @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "[ t ]    fig2.ps    for yba@xmath22cu@xmath23o@xmath24-samples of 80 @xmath25 thick that were  deposited on ndgao@xmath23 substrates , we recently found for the roughness of the _ 2-dimensional surface _ of the pile@xcite,@xcite:@xmath26    the values of these exponents are consistent with the q - ew ( quenched - disorder edwards  wilkinson ) model .",
    "apparently the vortices move on a substrate with randomly distributed quenched pinning sites , as is indeed expected for a high - t@xmath27 superconductor .",
    "similar values for @xmath9 and @xmath11 for the _ flux fronts _ in yba@xmath22cu@xmath23o@xmath24 thin films were previously obtained by surdeanu _ _ et al.__@xcite and for @xmath9 in niobium thin films by vlasko - vlasov _ _ et al.__@xcite . in general , the values of the exponents for the 2-dimensional surface are lower than for the fronts .",
    "the reason for obtaining similar values for @xmath9 and @xmath11 for the 1-d and 2-d case is the higher number of defects in the sample used for 2-d case .",
    "from a closer inspection of the growth process of the vortex ` mountain ' , shown on fig . [ heap ] , it is clear that the formation of this ` mountain ' and hence the flux penetration process is not continuous , but takes place in the form of avalanches . in our experimental procedure , the external field",
    "is increased in steps of @xmath28 and after each such increase an image of the vortex density in the sample is obtained .",
    "the size of each avalanche is calculated from @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the difference between two consecutive images _ minus _ the @xmath28 increase of the external field .",
    "the resulting time series of avalanches is shown in fig . [ vortexavals ] .",
    "[ t ]    fig3.ps    the size distribution of the avalanches is shown for differently sized windows of observation in fig .",
    "[ fsspre ] as a log - log plot . from the straight line behavior in the limit of large systems ( _ viz .",
    "_ large windows of observation ) , it is clear that the avalanche sizes are power law distributed with @xmath31 , just like earthquakes and many more natural phenomena@xcite .",
    "[ t ]    fig4.ps    the ubiquitous occurrence of power laws in many natural phenomena lead bak to the idea of self - organized criticality@xcite , a model where slowly driven systems organize themselves automatically to be in a metastable state where small disturbances can lead to a response of arbitrary size .",
    "the archetypal example is the sand pile with its critical slope ( metastability ) and the avalanches of sand sliding down its surface . within the soc framework ( and otherwise too ) , the volume @xmath32 of an avalanche with fractal dimension @xmath33 and linear extension @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 since the linear size of the avalanche is limited by the system size @xmath8 ( by neccesity @xmath36 ) , one expects that the finite size effect - induced deviations from the straight line in fig .",
    "[ fsspre ] scale as @xmath37 .",
    "indeed the finite size scaling ( fss ) plot of fig .",
    "[ fss ] shows a nice data collapse and yields@xcite @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "[ h ]    fig5.ps    apart from the fss and the power law behavior there is another check one can make for soc .",
    "this is based on the exponent relations of paczuski , maslow and bak@xcite .",
    "we discuss and use two such relations .",
    "the first scaling relation is found by calculating the volume @xmath32 of the fractal avalanche . by definition ,",
    "@xmath40 . also , this volume equals the fractal surface times the fractal height .",
    "the fractal surface area is the projection of the avalanche cluster on an average ( flat ) plane @xmath41 through the pile surface .",
    "this area is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the surface fractal dimension of the avalanche cluster .",
    "the height or thickness of an avalanche is obtained by subtracting the heights ( in the direction perpendicular to @xmath41 ) of the piles before and after the avalanche . since the avalanche modifies the pile only locally , this fractal thickness scales as the surface roughness and is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "hence @xmath32 @xmath45 . combining both expressions for @xmath32 yields @xmath46 from which we obtain the scaling relation@xmath47    the second scaling relation follows from the fact that the deviation from power law behavior seen in fig .",
    "[ fsspre ] occurs because avalanches above a certain size ` feel ' that the pile is finite .",
    "[ h ]    fig6.ps    this , of course , occurs at a time @xmath6 ( see eq . [ eq_tcross ] ) , when correlations and avalanches start to span the whole ` mountain ' . by definition",
    "the size of such an avalanche is @xmath48 .",
    "since we increase the external field at constant rate , @xmath6 also is proportional to the number of vortices @xmath49 we must add to the pile to obtain such a ` mountain'-spanning avalanche .",
    "however , before we create an avalanche of size @xmath48 , many smaller avalanches have occurred , adding to the number of vortices that we have to add before a ` mountain'-spanning avalanche takes place .",
    "thus @xmath49 is equal to the integral of the size distribution function up to @xmath48 , i.e. the shaded area in figure [ pmbbeta ] .",
    "this gives@xmath50    in the ffs analysis we found that @xmath51 , hence we obtain @xmath52    combination with eq.[eq_tcross ] yields the exponent relation@xmath53    equations [ eq_pmbalpha ] and [ eq_pmbbeta ] , which were previously derived by paczuski _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , offer an interesting possibility : one can calculate the roughness and growth exponents , @xmath9 and @xmath11 , from the _ avalanche _ properties only . in the table below we compare the values from such an analysis with those obtained above from a direct roughness analysis of the surface of the pile :    @xmath54{|l|l|l|}\\hline & $ ] @xmath55@xmath560.8 ( 1 ) @xmath550.6 ( 1 ) @xmath570.7 ( 1 ) @xmath550.5 ( 1 ) @xmath58    clearly , a good agreement is found , which supports the underlying assumption i.e. that soc theory yields a valid description of the avalanche behavior in this superconductor .",
    "naturally , one may wonder whether the avalanche and roughness properties in _ all _ superconductors are governed by soc . to investigate this question , we study these properties as a function of quenched disorder . as a sample we use a 500 nm thick niobium thin film on an @xmath59-plane ( @xmath60 ) sapphire substrate , which is a superconductor with @xmath61 , but which also absorbs hydrogen from the surrounding atmosphere .",
    "the hydrogen enters the niobium lattice interstitially and at low temperatures precipitates in small non - superconducting clusters , that ( like other defects ) constitute strong pinning centers .",
    "the hydrogen gas absorption was always done at room temperature by applying a certain hydrogen gas pressure for @xmath62 hour .",
    "typical flux penetration patterns are shown in fig .",
    "[ nbh ] .",
    "[ t ]    fig7.ps    avalanches are observed during the slow increase of the externally applied magnetic field , in similar manner as described above .",
    "the avalanches in the hydrogen - free sample are quite compact and all of similar size , while those in the hydrogenated sample ( e.g. at 18.1 @xmath63 ) are more fractal and have a large range of sizes . as a consequence ,",
    "a finite size scaling analysis@xcite _ does _ work for the hydrogenated sample , but not for the hydrogen free sample .",
    "this , together with a significant change in fractal dimension@xcite , indicates that ( at least for these samples ) soc occurs only if a minimal amount of static disorder is present .",
    "we conjecture that this is a more general phenomenon and that also on granular piles soc behavior depends on the possibility that disorder ( randomness ) can develop on its surface .",
    "if a superconductor is perforated with a square array of tiny holes ( @xmath64 in diameter and designated as ` anti - dots ' ) , the moving vortices tend to be guided in the direction of the lattice vector of these holes@xcite . in this case , avalanches are still possible , but they are guided in similar manner , reducing their fractal dimension , see fig .",
    "[ fig_antidots ]",
    ". however , still a power law distribution of avalanche sizes is observed@xcite : the guiding apparently does not destroy soc behavior .",
    "[ t ]    fig8.ps",
    "interestingly , in very similar samples , 500 nm thick niobium thin films on an @xmath65-plane ( @xmath66 ) sapphire substrate ( and without anti - dots ) , a completely different behavior is observed , see fig .",
    "[ nba ] .    [ t ]    fig9.ps    at low temperatures ( @xmath67 ) , upon increasing the field after cooling in zero field , initially",
    ", the vortex density is rather smooth , but somewhat plume - like , similar to what is shown in fig .",
    "[ nba]f . after exceeding a certain distance from the edge , however , large avalanches occur , which span immediately nearly half of the width of the sample . at low temperature ( fig .",
    "[ nba]a ) these avalanches are much more narrow and less branched than at higher temperature ( fig .",
    "[ nba]e ) .",
    "after each avalanche , the ` smooth ' front starts again from the sample edge and runs over the previous , still existing , vortex landscape .",
    "as soon as it is close to the previous front , a new avalanche may occur .",
    "the avalanches do not reproduce in the same spot from one experiment to the next , indicating that the phenomenon is due to an intrinsic instability and not to defects in the samples .",
    "recently aranson _ _ et al.__@xcite developed a nice theoretical model , which was also used as the basis for numerical simulations , which very closely resemble the experimental results ( similar experimental results were obtained before , see refs 3 - 9 of ref .",
    "@xcite , while similar models were developed by shantsev _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite and baggio _ _  et al.__@xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the system is described by two coupled differential equations:@xmath68   + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left [ r\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\\right ]   -\\tau\\dot{h}_{0}\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 is a reduced temperature , @xmath70 is the current density and @xmath71 the resistivity of the superconductor , @xmath72 is a local magnetization , defined by @xmath73 . for thin film samples , like ours ,",
    "the second equation is highly non - local , which is described by the kernel @xmath74 .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 contains the thermal properties of the film and its contact to the substrate , while the parameter @xmath76 is the ratio between magnetic and thermal diffusion times .",
    "small values of @xmath76 make the system more unstable . for a detailed comparison between model and experiment see ref .",
    "we find evidence for soc behavior of avalanches on the vortex landscape of many different superconductors , provided that enough ( quenched ) disorder is present .",
    "this soc ( avalanche ) behavior is preserved in the presence of a square array of strong pins ( anti - dots ) . for superconductors close to thermal runaway",
