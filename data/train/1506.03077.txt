    "the most common approach to determine the lowest - energy crystal structure is based on variants of microscopic density functional theory , which specifies atoms with their electronic shells and attempts to optimize their spatial arrangement @xcite .",
    "due to computational complexity , this is a variational approach that can effectively treat only periodic arrangements of atoms . near the melting transition , application of this method",
    "becomes difficult since atoms in a liquid lack spatial periodicity .",
    "in that regime , methods combining density functional theory with molecular dynamics are applied , but only with limited success @xcite .",
    "periodic _ approximants _ to quasicrystals have also been studied by density functional theory @xcite ; application of this method , however , requires a very large number of atoms to be explicitly considered and optimized for the approximants energies to provide a good estimate for quasicrystals , even away from the melting transition .",
    "another , semi - microscopic , approach is based on the peierls instability - type arguments . there , one studies the features in the electronic susceptibility and attempts to use its anomalies as a predictor of stable phases .",
    "this approach is problematic in the case of 3d alloys , as can be easily seen .",
    "we would like to have an unbiased predictor of an ordered state ; therefore , the only starting point possible is free electron fermi sea coupled to featureless ( constant ) ionic density . in 1d ,",
    "electronic susceptibility diverges at @xmath94 at @xmath96 , which leads to a density instability at this wavevector ; this is the origin of charge density waves in many quasi-1d materials .",
    "in contrast , in 3d , free electron susceptibility is maximized at zero momentum and at @xmath94 only has infinite first derivative ( the cause of friedel oscillations of electron mediated interaction @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is insufficient to cause instability in ionic density  theory would predict that the instability should occur at zero wavevector , i.e. , at uniform density .",
    "moreover , the ( quadratic ) term in the gl theory that is proportional to the electronic susceptibility only includes a single density modulation , and thus can not discern between orderings that contain multiple wave vectors .",
    "a way to go beyond the quadratic energy approximation is to include the ionic modulation non - perturbatively in electron dispersion @xcite .",
    "it has been argued this way that for a given crystal structure , the electronic energy is minimized when the fermi surface  just crosses \" the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "this naturally corresponds to crystal - specific optimal @xmath2 ratios , and thus appears to be consistent with the empirical hume - rothery rules .",
    "application of this approach to discriminate between energies of different crystalline and quasicrystalline states is , however , problematic , as it presupposes the knowledge of the amplitude of the periodic lattice ( pseudo-)potential , which is different for different crystals .",
    "since the energies of various states are typically rather similar , the uncertainty in the potential makes such approach unreliable .",
    "integration of electronic degrees of freedom leads to the following corrections to the ionic free energy functional :    f^(2 ) & = & - d_1 d_2 _ _ k_1,q_1 , k_2,q_2v_q_1 _",

    "as one can see , the new terms in the ginzburg - landau functional have the form similar to those already contained in @xmath15 ( eq . ( [ eq : wc ] ) ) .",
    "the second order term @xmath98 only serves to redefine @xmath0 and hence will be of no interest to us .",
    "the prefactor of the cubic term becomes a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we find by numerical integration that the electronic contribution to this term is non - singular in the limit of zero temperature , and thus it does not introduce any qualitatively new features relative to those already in @xmath15 .",
    "the 4th order correction @xmath99 can diverge if certain geometric conditions are satisfied ( see figure 1 of the main text ) .",
    "thus we concentrate here on this term only .    the first type of 4th order term that we will consider is self - interaction .",
    "self - interaction is generated by box diagrams with momentum transfers @xmath100 ( type a ) and @xmath101 ( type b ) .",
    "the combinatorial multiplicities of these diagrams can be calculated as follows . at every vertex of the box diagram we can place @xmath102 . for a type",
    ", there the sign pattern has to be such that same signs are adjacent , while for b  interlaced .",
    "there are 4 ways to place two adjacent + + in 4 boxes .",
    "hence a type has multiplicity 4 . for b type",
    ", there are only two distinct ways to arrange : @xmath104 , and multiplicity is 2 .",
    "therefore , the self - interaction goes as    @xmath105    there are two types of mutual interaction diagrams : those that contain only two pairs of @xmath13 (  coplanar \" diagrams ) , and those that contain four distinct @xmath37 s (  non - coplanar \" diagrams ) .",
    "coplanar diagrams depend only on one angle between @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 we get self - interaction ) .",
    "there are three distinct contributions to @xmath109 , which come from the following arrangements or momenta around the box diagram : @xmath110 ( type v@xmath111 ) , @xmath112 ( type v@xmath113 ) , and @xmath114 ( type d ) .",
    "their combinatorial multiplicities are as follows :    v@xmath111 + v@xmath113 : 4 ways to place @xmath106 , 2 ways to place @xmath115 next to it ( pbc ) , 2 way to place @xmath116 : total 16 .",
    "hence there are 8 diagrams of each type .",
    "d : 4 ways to place @xmath106 , 2 ways to place @xmath116 .",
    "total multiplicity is 8 .",
    "therefore , the mutual interaction term is    & _ i < j(8v_1 + 8v_2 + 8d)|_q_i|^2|_q_j|^2 + & = _ ij(4v_1 + 4v_2 + 4d)|_q_i|^2|_q_j|^2 .    notice , that in the limit @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 . hence ,",
    "going back to the original notation in terms of @xmath42 , we find that the full 4th order gl term is @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( it can be shown explicitly that the limit @xmath123 is continuous at finite temperature ) .",
    "the interaction functions can be obtained by a mixture of analytical and numerical integration .",
    "the frequency summations could be performed with the help of contour integration ,    \\{v_1,v_2 } & = & _ k + + & & - - + - , and d & = & _ k + + & & + + .",
    "the numerical integration over momenta has to be done with care due to singular denominators .",

    ", there is a possibility of a non - coplanar interaction diagrams .",
    "they obtain if there are non - trivial @xmath126 that add up to 0 .",

    "here we show that splitting of one bragg peak into a pair is unfavorable .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of @xmath42 being smooth as @xmath123 , as is the case for electron - mediated and local interactions .",
    "indeed , assume that there is an energetically favorable ( possibly multi-@xmath73 ) configurations with a spot at @xmath151 with amplitude @xmath152 . now , suppose we split it into two at @xmath153 and @xmath154 , both approximately equal to @xmath151 . to keep the interaction with the other momentum components unchanged ( we assumed it to be optimal ) , we need @xmath155 .",
    "that keeps the second order ( r ) and the interaction with distant @xmath91 components intact .",
    "however , instead of the original self - interaction we now have @xmath156 .",
    "hence , the energy goes up , and splitting is not favored for @xmath157 . indeed , the crystallization simulations starting from random initial conditions show the extinction behavior : large bragg peak suppresses its smaller neighbors , leaving in the end only a small number of spots that correspond to a ( q)crystal .",
    "to explore the stability of iqc state with respect to distortions away from perfect icosahedron , let us expand the interaction energy in the vicinity of the iqc :      for the sake of argument will neglect the fact that the amplitudes of the order parameter can also react to distortions  this will only further lower the energy of distorted state . then , defining @xmath159 ,      now we can define convenient coordinates for the bragg peaks on the sphere , and explore whether the energy can be lowered by a distortion .",
    "both the first and second derivate terms define quadratic forms with non - negative eigenvalues ( due to the nonlinear dependence of @xmath161 on local coordinates , even the first order term produces quadratic form upon expansion ) . out of 12 total eigenvalues ,",
    "the quadratic form of @xmath162 has only 4 non - zeros ; in contrast @xmath163 has only 3 zero modes that correspond to rigid global rotations . when put together , for @xmath164 negative stiffness modes",

    "four zero modes simultaneously appear , forming a flat zero - frequency band as a function of quasimomentum on icosahedron .",
    "hence , the conclusion is that even if @xmath42 reaches the minimum at non - icosahedral anlge , the iqc remains ( at least ) locally stable for @xmath167 (  tensile strain \" between bragg peaks ) , and even for  compressive strain \" it remain stable until a critical value of negative @xmath168 is reached ."

    "<S> _ crystallization is probably the most familiar but one of the hardest to analyze phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the workhorse of the theory of phase transitions , the ginzburg - landau theory @xcite , can not be easily applied to many of the crystallization transitions since they tend to be strongly first order , i.e. , the order parameter experiences a large jump at the transition .    </S>",
    "<S> crystals are best characterized in reciprocal space , where the onset of long - range order is signaled by the appearance of resolution - limited bragg peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the bragg peaks reflects the density distribution in a material  for smooth density modulations , as in the case of liquid crystals , only few harmonics of principal peaks located on a momentum shell of radius @xmath0 are needed to fully describe the state . </S>",
    "<S> then , the intensity of principal harmonics is the order parameter , and when it is small near the transition ( relative to the average density ) , the application of the ginzburg - landau theory is justified . in atomic crystals , </S>",
    "<S> however , density is highly peaked at the equilibrium positions of atoms , and the number of relevant bragg peak harmonics scales in proportion to the ratio of the unit cell size to the atomic size ( smeared by thermal and quantum fluctuations ) . in a typical crystal , </S>",
    "<S> the thermal fluctuations of atoms are @xmath1 of the lattice spacing at the melting transition @xcite ; therefore , to accuratley describe the transition , multiple harmonics of @xmath0 are required . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of strong modulation immedaitely at the phase transition , with multiple bragg peaks forming reciprocal lattice , is the signature of strongly first order transition . </S>",
    "<S> a special case of a crystalline solid is a _ quasicrystal _ , where atoms lack simple spatial periodicity ; yet , in the reciprocal space , resolution - limited bragg peaks appear in a self - similar arrangement inconsistent with crystallographically allowed point - group symmetries @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> weak crystallization theory @xcite applies ginzburg - landau machinery to crystallization by assuming that only the bragg peaks on a single momentum shell are significant enough to affect energy . while most naturally applicable to liquid crystals , the theory has been used to predict ubiquity of body centered cubic ( bcc ) crystals near crystallization temperature @xcite , to study effects of fluctuations @xcite , and , with some modifications , to address the problem of stability of quasicrystals @xcite . as such , </S>",
    "<S> it has been a useful symmetry - based tool to study the crystallization transition , even beyond its immediate range of validity . however , in its standard spatially - local form , weak crystallization theory is incapable of obtaining many of the experimentally relevant crystalline states , such as simple cubic , rhombohedral , or face centered cubic ( fcc ) , and the heuristic modifications of it have not been microscopically justified .    </S>",
    "<S> crystals are often ( qualitatively ) separated into classes based on the dominant type of interaction that holds them together : ionic , covalent , molecular , and metallic . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal structure depends on a variety of details , such as ionic charge and electronic orbital structure , etc . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore remarkable , that in the case of metallic crystalline alloys simple empirical rules exist . </S>",
    "<S> these rules were identified by hume - rothery @xcite who has found that metallic alloys are particularly stable when in addition to the requirement that atoms be of similar size and electronegativity , the value of the average valence per atom (  @xmath2 \" ratio ) be close to certain  magic \" values , which depend on the crystal structure . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal @xmath2 ratio has been argued to be associated with a particular geometrical matching condition , when the itinerant ( nearly - free ) electron fermi surface  just crosses \" the boundary of the first brillouin zone @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of interpretation , this observation points to an important , if not decisive , role that itinerant electrons play in determining the crystal structure . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed not surprising given that electrons are an effective mediator of long - ranged and multi - body interionic interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> significantly , majority of stable quasicrystals have turned out to be hume - rothery alloys @xcite , i.e. , they are stable for narrow ranges of @xmath2 . despite nominally large conduction electron concentration , their electrical and thermal conductivities are exceptionally low @xcite , consistent with strong scattering around the fermi surface . in analogy to regular crystals , attempts have been made to construct a theory of quasicrystals accounting for the hume - rothery rules by perturbatively including electron scattering on quasiperiodic ionic potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> just as in the case of regular crystals , such approach is problematic ( see appendix [ sec : others ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> there have also been attempts to understand the formation of quasicrystals in terms of weak crystallization theory @xcite ; however , there have been no microscopic justification of the theoretical assumptions , and in particular these theories can not account for the fact that most of quasicrystals follow the hume - rothery rules .    </S>",

    "<S> we do so by explicitly introducing itinerant electrons that couple to the ionic density , and integrating them out . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath66 do not form equilateral triangles , and hence the cubic invariant that could stabilize bcc ( fcc reciprocal ) crystal does not contribute ( the latter assumption should become valid for sufficiently large negative @xmath67 ) . </S>",
    "<S> now it only remains to minimize the energy to obtain ,    @xmath68    and f = -.[eq : var ]    it is important to note that the pure electronic vertex @xmath69 is negative ( attractive ) in a wide range of @xmath0 and @xmath70 , which taken by itself could cause an absolute instability . in this regime , one can not truncate @xmath71 at fourth order , but must include higher - order terms in the gl expansion to find stable equilibrium states </S>",
    "<S> . however , the structureless local interaction @xmath17 restores stability while maintaining the strong angle - dependence of the interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of our analysis are presented in figure  [ fig : pd ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find only four stable phases : rhombohedral , striped , fcc , and iqc ( i.e. , icosahedral quasicrystal ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other symmetric variational states we explored are always higher in free energy than these ( see lower panel of figure [ fig : pd ] for energy comparison and appendix [ sec : var ] for details of the variational states ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overall shape of the phase diagram can be understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> when the structureless interaction @xmath17 is absent or too weak , as noted above , the free energy can become unstable at quartic order . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath17 is dominant , the electron - induced interaction can be ignored , and we recover the standard weak - crystallization result that the equilibrium state is striped ( or smectic ) . </S>",
    "<S> when we are far from the matching condition @xmath72 , or the temperature is relatively high , the interactions are not strongly angle - dependent , and these are the two dominant possibilites . on the other hand , when the structureless and electronic contributions are of similar magnitude _ and _ </S>",
    "<S> the temperature is low , the angle - dependence of the electron - mediated interaction stabilizes nontrivial crystalline phases .    </S>",
    "<S> the most significant qualitative feature of the phase diagram for intermediate values of @xmath17 is the dominance of fcc and rhombohedral phases , with balance shifting in favor of fcc at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this trend is that fcc has two appealing features  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) it has only one inter-@xmath73 angle @xmath36 ( up to @xmath74 ) , and ( 2 ) it has lower energy due to the presence of non - coplanar 4th order terms . </S>",
    "<S> rhombohedral crystal only has former feature , and thus only becomes competitive when the angle @xmath8 that minimizes @xmath42 is sufficiently far from the tetrahedral angle . </S>",
    "<S> surrounded by the fcc and rhombohedral phases is the iqc phase . </S>",
    "<S> the key advantage of iqc phase is that it has large number ( six ) of @xmath13 pairs , all separated by the same angle @xmath75 ( @xmath76 is the golden mean ) . </S>",
    "<S> even thought iqc can not benefit from the non - coplanar energy terms , when the optimal angle @xmath8 is close to the @xmath77 , iqc can beat both fcc and rhombohedral . finally , for large @xmath17 we recover the stripe phase predicted by the original featureless weak crystallization theory .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from the fcc phase with its non - coplanar terms in energy , the phase diagram can be understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> for the states with only one non - trivial inter-@xmath73 angle @xmath8 , the denominator in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : var ] ) is @xmath78/n$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the second term is positive , it favors large @xmath59 ; it it is negative , then @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath80 states with all possible @xmath59 s are energetically degenerate ( can be seen in triple crossing point in figure [ fig : pd](lower ) at @xmath81 ) .     </S>",

    "<S> lower panel shows energy comparison of different variational states for a fixed value of @xmath17 at @xmath82.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in construction of the phase diagram we have only considered highly symmetric states . </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss possible deviations from these assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> first , we can ask whether the highly symmetric crystal states are stable with respect to  bragg - fractionalization , \" namely whether it may be beneficial to split bragg peaks into multiple nearby ones . from the fact that @xmath83 , which can be explicitly demonstrated for electron - mediated and local interaction , for @xmath84 , lack of fractionalization follows trivially ( see appendix [ sec : frac ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the next possibility is a distortion of peaks from symmetric positions . </S>",
    "<S> clearly this is not a concern for rhombohedral state , but could be for iqc and fcc . here </S>",
    "<S> we specifically ask whether iqc will remain stable even if @xmath85 is not exactly @xmath77 ( see appendix [ sec : dist ] ) . due to its high symmetry iqc </S>",
    "<S> can not naturally distort , unlike , e.g. , rhombohedral state . to answer this question , </S>",
    "<S> we have expanded the interaction energy around the symmetric iqc state . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that if @xmath86 , then iqc spontaneously distorts into a lower symmetry state , i.e. a distortion could occur if @xmath87 (  compresses springs \" ) . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion also shows that if @xmath42 is sufficiently smooth , as it is for temperatures not very much smaller than the fermi energy , then undistorted iqc should in fact be quite stable . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , expanding around @xmath88 , we find that criterion for instability is @xmath89 , i.e. , the minimum is at least 40@xmath90 away ( above ) from the icosahedral angle . this estimate is based on the assumption of smoothness of @xmath42 , which is violated at temperatures much below the fermi temperature . thus , for quasicrystals that form under such conditions , there is a possibility of distorted iqc , as well as a structural transition from perfect to distorted iqc as a function of temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also explored possible ordered states in an alternative fashion by applying unconstrained stochastic minimization of the free energy functional . to simplify simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we neglected the cubic and non - coplanar quartic terms and thus can not fully capture fcc and bcc phases ; however , the advantage of this method is that it provides an unbiased treatment for arbitrary multi-@xmath91 states that are not required to possess any special symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> we start from random configuration of several hundred components @xmath51 with @xmath37 on a sphere or radius @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we then iteratively minimize energy by randomly selecting @xmath51 and changing its value and position on @xmath0 sphere in the direction of decreasing energy . </S>",
    "<S> the minimization results are consistent with the variational phase diagram in figure [ fig : pd ] ( modulo underestimating the stability of fcc ) . due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , however , it sometimes converges to other states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the region of stability of iqc , the final state is rather commonly the decagonal state , which is approximately the iqc state with one pair @xmath92 removed . </S>",
    "<S> this state is and example of a 2d quasicrystal  it is periodic along one axis and quasiperiodic in the plane perpendicular to it . even though the energy of this state is very close to the iqc , </S>",
    "<S> we have not observed it ever to be lower in energy than the perfect iqc ( consistently with figure [ fig : pd ] ( lower ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy difference is nevertheless sufficiently delicate , so one can not rule out that for modified conditions decagonal state may appear as the lowest energy state in the phase diagram .    the conjecture that stability of 3d quasicrystals is associated with  bond - orientational order \" that favors specific inter-@xmath93 angles within weak crystallization theory has been previously expressed by mermin and troian @xcite and jaric @xcite . in ref </S>",
    "<S> @xcite an auxiliary field was introduced to generate preferred inter-@xmath93 angle , however , no physical justification was given as to the nature of this field . </S>",
    "<S> the key result of our work is that itinerant electrons play the role similar to the auxiliary field postulated in @xcite . on the experimental side </S>",
    "<S> , it has been found that the optimal e / a ratio observed in quasicrystals corresponds to the approximate matching between the quasisrystalline _ </S>",
    "<S> quasi_-brillouin zone and the electronic fermi surface , that is , the length of the dominant bragg wave vector equals the diameter of the fermi surface , @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed what we find .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have analyzed the effects of electron - ion interactions on crystallization transition within weak crystallization theory . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the angular - depended multi - ion interactions induced by electrons can lead to stabilization of such empirically common but elusive , within the standard theory , states as rhombohedral , fcc , and icosahedral quaiscrystals . </S>",
    "<S> the stability conditions can be recast in terms of hume - rothery rules connecting primary ionic ordering wave - vectors and the size of the electronic fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> our results are obtained within the assumption that the cubic invariants are less relevant than the quartic ones , i.e. , at temperatures sufficiently lower than the temperature of mean field transition ( @xmath95 ) . near the transition , more careful analysis of fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> is required @xcite , which will be the subject of future work .    </S>",
