    "there are two possibilities for the occurrence of a phase transition between hadronic and strange quark matter ( sqm ) that are well known",
    ". the first could occur at very high temperatures and very low baryon density in the early universe , and the second , as suggested by bodmer  @xcite , at densities of higher order than the nuclear density @xmath3  @xmath4 .",
    "this phase transition would occur in the universe , every time that a massive star explodes as a supernova , with its consequent remnant .",
    "if bodmer s conjecture is true , sqm could be succeeded in the inner core of neutron stars where strange quarks would be produced through the weak processes with a dynamical chemical equilibrium among the constituents .",
    "it is also possible that after a supernova explosion its core forms directly a strange quark star ( sqs ) @xcite .",
    "the key property of sqm is that it has a binding energy that could be lower than that of @xmath5fe over a rather wide range of the qcd parameters @xcite .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to seek connections between sqm or sqs that could explain the observations of anomalous radiations from anomalous x - pulsars ( axps ) and low energy @xmath6-ray radiation from soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgrs ) @xcite . in several sqm studies",
    "the essential conclusion is that a more compact matter would be the cause of these observations  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "astrophysical observations point out that compact objects are endowed with strong magnetic fields which should play an important role in neutron stars or sqs .",
    "it is believed that magnetic fields larger than @xmath7  g are the central engine of their radiations .",
    "as is well known , a magnetic field modifies the microscopic properties of matter with the corresponding macroscopic implication .",
    "however , the role of the magnetic field in sqm has not been fully studied and understood .",
    "@xcite is a pioneer work in this field .",
    "the thermodynamical properties of quark matter in a strong magnetic field have also been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , using the mit bag model modified by the inclusion of the magnetic field in the lagrangian . in these works",
    ", it has been confirmed that there is an anisotropy of pressures due to the strong magnetic field  @xcite , and that the mit bag model can be used satisfactorily to study the magnetized quark matter . a first approach to consider the role of the anomalous magnetic moment ( amm ) for quark matter has been followed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are theoretical and experimental studies which indicate that quarks have an amm @xcite .",
    "a stringent bound on the quark amm has been obtained  @xcite from high precision measurements at lep , slc and hera .",
    "thus , the contribution from the amm of the quarks could be significant in sqm .",
    "on the other hand , for electrons , the effects of the amm turn out to be small over the range of magnetic fields typically attained in neutron stars ( @xmath8  g )  @xcite and , therefore , can be safely neglected in our calculations .",
    "the scope of the present paper is to study the role of the amm in the spectrum of particles and its relevance in the thermodynamic properties and stability of the sqm , considering @xmath0-equilibrium and charge neutrality .",
    "we consider that the constituents of sqm interact with the magnetic field via their charges and their amm .",
    "the effects of this interaction with the amm could be seen in two forms .",
    "the first one is that quarks and electrons have the energy quantized in landau levels due to their charge .",
    "the normal magnetic moment is included in the spectrum through an integer moment .",
    "this quantization leads to a description of the polarization of the particles and to a softer equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the second one is due to the inclusion of amm terms .",
    "this causes a further splitting of the energy levels and the spectrum of the particles is no longer degenerate .",
    "but the most relevant implication of amm in the spectrum of the particles comes from the ground state : it could be zero depending on the magnetic field strength .",
    "thus , the amm for individual particles establishes upper bounds on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "we analyze the consequence of this fact in the macroscopic properties of the sqm in @xmath0-equilibrium .    for individual constituents ,",
    "we find a saturation value for the field that align particles parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field , depending on the amm sign .",
    "this value of the magnetic field corresponds to a maximum of spin polarization and to the magnetization independent of b. this is the usual paramagnetic behavior . beyond this saturation field ,",
    "the spin polarization , magnetization as well as other thermodynamical quantities , become complex , which points towards a ferromagnetism phase transition .",
    "since our treatment is based on non - interacting particles , we can not address the question of whether this limiting value corresponds or not to a phase transition .",
    "to clarify this issue a detailed study of the spin - spin coupling becomes necessary .",
    "let us also remark that the sqm in @xmath0-equilibrium adds new restrictions to the upper bound on the magnetic field .",
    "in this case , the polarization of sqm depends on the individual polarization of the constituents and its orientation is related to the amm sign .",
    "the system is so complex that the total polarization is not reached in any direction .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to find a critical value of the magnetic field beyond which the polarization becomes complex , lacking physical sense .",
    "our results improve earlier works in three aspects .",
    "firstly , we take into account pauli paramagnetism in its relativistic version , because the one - particle energy is the solution of the dirac equation including the amm .",
    "this gives an important contribution to the physics of the system .",
    "the upper bound on the magnetic field for each particle is lower than the one obtained classically .",
    "secondly , we consider the anisotropies of the pressures within the mit bag model .",
    "this leads to changes in the behavior of the total energy of the system for strong magnetic fields .",
    "finally , all quarks are assumed to interact with the magnetic field .",
    "the most important astrophysical implication of our study is the existence of a limiting value for the magnetic field .",
    "for sqm with electrons we find an upper bound on the magnetic field around @xmath9  g. this allows us to conclude that there would not be quark stars with magnetic fields greater than this value .",
    "another effect associated with the inclusion of the amm in the particle spectrum is that it can avoid the divergence arising through the lowest landau level ( @xmath10 ) in the calculation of the surface tension and curvature for dense matter , and which play a crucial role in the quark droplet nucleation process  @xcite .",
    "this means that it is still possible that a first - order phase transition to quark matter can occur  @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of this effect and its astrophysical consequences is in progress .",
    "the amm might play a role if bose - einstein condensation due to the bosonization of fermions takes place .",
    "we expect in that case a ferromagnetic behavior , able to maintain the applied magnetic field self - consistently  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we study the spectrum of constituents of the magnetized sqm : electrons and quarks .",
    "[ sec3 ] is devoted to the analysis of the thermodynamic properties of the magnetized sqm . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we establish the requirement for the stability of sqm in @xmath0-equilibrium , and study the spin polarization and its implication for the thermodynamical properties of the system . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we present our numerical results , including a comparison of the behavior of sqm when amm are taken into account with the case when the latter are neglected .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the relativistic spectrum of electrons in the presence of a magnetic field with the inclusion of amm is obtained from the dirac pauli equation @xmath11\\psi^{e}=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 @xmath13 is the electron charge , @xmath14 is the electron mass , @xmath15 is the electromagnetic tensor and @xmath16 is the fine structure constant .",
    "considering a constant uniform magnetic field @xmath17 in the @xmath18-direction , the energy spectrum is given by . ]",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 are the eigenvalues corresponding to the orientations of the particle magnetic moment , parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field .",
    "an analogous equation can be written for quarks , so that the spectra for all the constituents of sqm have the form    @xmath22    with @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the charges and the masses of the particles , respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath27 are the corresponding amm of the particles , @xmath28 where @xmath29 in our calculations we shall take @xmath30  mev and @xmath31  mev for the light quark masses .",
    "the magnitudes of the so - called critical fields @xmath32 ( when particle s cyclotron energy is comparable to its rest mass ) are @xmath33  g , @xmath34  g , @xmath35  g and @xmath36  g.    it can be seen from the spectra ( [ energy ] ) that , besides of the quantization of their orbits in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , charged particles with amm undergo the splitting of the energy levels with the corresponding disappearance of the spectrum degeneracy . for the non - anomalous case ,",
    "@xmath37 , the minimum energy is independent of the magnetic field strength and the magnetic field only quantizes the kinetic energy perpendicular to the field .",
    "in this situation , the energy is degenerate for landau levels higher than zero .",
    "states with spin parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field orientation ( @xmath21 ) have the same energy .",
    "however , the anomalous case , @xmath38 , removes this degeneracy . in the latter case",
    ", the rest energy of the particles depends on the magnetic field strength .",
    "the ground state energy is @xmath39    the above equation leads to the appearance of a threshold value for the magnetic field at which the effective mass vanishes , @xmath40 .",
    "the thresholds of the field , @xmath41 , for all the constituents of the sqm are given by @xmath42 that are smaller than the ones obtained when the classical amm contribution is considered  @xcite .",
    "the meaning of the ground state energy value for qed was discussed long time ago  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it was not emphasized enough the fact that , due to the degeneracy of the orbit center , such ground state level may be populated by a larger number of particles . the expression ( [ energy1 ] )",
    "suggests that the energy of the particles becomes smaller than the corresponding one for the antiparticles , with the consequent creation of pairs .",
    "the sign of the energy state is an invariant property for particles and antiparticles .",
    "this also means that positive and negative energy levels of electrons will never cross each other , i.e. it exists a non - crossing property . the spontaneous pair creation in a magnetic field is forbidden .",
    "thus , for individual particles , the correct meaning of this  critical \" field is that it corresponds to an upper bound .",
    "let us remark that in the sqm scenario all the constituents interact with the magnetic field and are obliged to satisfy the equilibrium conditions . under such constraints",
    ", it turns out that the dominant threshold field comes from @xmath43 quarks , thus leading to the upper bound @xmath44",
    "g ( see section [ sec5 ] below ) .",
    "this result has an important astrophysical consequence , since the bound for sqm can be also extrapolated to the sqs scenario .",
    "if sqs exist , the maximum magnetic field strength that they could support would be around the above bound , i.e. @xmath45  g.",
    "the mit bag model is appropriate for the study of magnetized quark matter  @xcite . in that model ,",
    "confinement is guaranteed by the bag and quarks are considered as a fermi gas of noninteracting particles . under these assumptions , it is possible to study the thermodynamical properties of a quark gas in a strong magnetic field . in this section",
    "we investigate the thermodynamical properties of the sqm when the amm is included .",
    "the inclusion of amm and the consequent loss of degeneracy implies that the sum over landau levels is replaced by two sums @xmath46 for each thermodynamical quantity , the summation over the spin orientation leads to two contributions , corresponding to particles with the spin aligned parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field .",
    "moreover , since particles have positive or negative amm , they have different preferences in the spin orientation with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "as we shall see below , this has important consequences in the eos of the system .",
    "the most relevant comes from the lowest energy ground state , which depends on the strength of the magnetic field and it could be zero ( cf .",
    "( [ energy1 ] ) ) .    for a degenerate magnetized sqm , where only particles contribute to the thermodynamical potential and temperature can be formally taken as zero , the expression for the thermodynamical potential can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a degeneration parameter ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "we find @xmath67 with @xmath68    we may also calculate the magnetic susceptibility @xmath69 , which is defined as @xmath70 and can measure if a phase transition takes place or not . the resulting expression is @xmath71 where @xmath72^{3/2 } } \\ln\\frac{x_i + g_{i}^{\\pm}}{h_{i}^{\\pm}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we notice that the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility are not linear functions of @xmath17 . moreover , the requirement for the ground state energy @xmath73 is equivalent to the condition @xmath74 ( see eq .",
    "( [ he ] ) ) . since all the thermodynamical quantities depend on @xmath75 , they loose their physical meaning when @xmath76",
    ". therefore , the condition @xmath77 means that the system can not admit a value of the magnetic field greater than @xmath78 , which indicates that some phase transition occurs .",
    "the magnetization reaches a value independent of the magnetic field , as it occurs for a paramagnetic system , but beyond this limit it becomes complex and could be associated to a ferromagnetic transition .",
    "let us now write down the expression for the anisotropy of pressures and for the energy density of sqm when the amm is included .",
    "the energy density , @xmath79 , for the gas of @xmath80-particles can be obtained from the energy - momentum tensor  @xcite , leading to @xmath81 evaluating this expression we find @xmath82 the pressures are obtained from the expressions @xmath83 using eqs .",
    "( [ potential ] ) and ( [ magnet ] ) we find @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    "in this section we study the stability condition of the sqm in a strong magnetic field . in the context of the mit bag model and in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", the stability condition for sqm means to study the equation @xmath86 together with the total energy @xmath87 under the condition @xmath88 .    in the presence of a strong magnetic field ,",
    "the bag pressure @xmath89 has an anisotropic form that depends on the @xmath17-direction in space , @xmath90 since the magnetization is always a positive function , this anisotropy in the pressures implies @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the stability condition for strong fields changes from @xmath88 to @xmath92 or , equivalently , @xmath93 the total energy becomes @xmath94 for weak fields @xmath95 and we get the expression @xmath96 which is in agreement with  @xcite where anisotropies due to strong magnetic fields have not been considered .      in ref .",
    "@xcite the landau diamagnetism related to charged particles in a magnetic field was studied , treating classically the relativistic behavior and pauli paramagnetism associated with the inclusion of amm .",
    "our starting viewpoint is different .",
    "we consider a relativistic equation of motion , taking into account both contributions from a relativistic point of view . in this sense ,",
    "our treatment is more robust since the amm is included in the spectrum of particles as a relativistic effect .",
    "as we have already shown , the thermodynamical quantities for each constituent of sqm have two terms , related to particles with spin up and down orientations .",
    "the number density is not excluded from this fact , so it is important to study its behavior because it gives us information about the spin polarization of the system .",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) in the form @xmath97 in the absence of a magnetic field or when @xmath98 we can see that @xmath99 . on the other hand , in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the relation for the number density implies the existence of a magnetic field strength threshold for which complete saturation of each constituent of the sqm occurs .",
    "whether or not a complete saturation for all the particles involved in the system is attained will depend on the sqm equilibrium conditions .",
    "we can define the spin polarization rate as @xmath100 when @xmath78 is reached , we have the following condition for each constituent particle , @xmath101 which means that @xmath102 is maximum and @xmath103 .",
    "the threshold field value @xmath104 saturates the system and aligns all particles parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field .",
    "this alignment depends on the sign of the amm of each particle . from the thermodynamical point of view , this behavior could be understood as a paramagnetic response of the system and it makes an important difference . beyond this magnetic field value",
    "all the thermodynamical quantities become complex for a pure gas of particles .",
    "let us recall that the conditions of @xmath0-equilibrium and charge neutrality add new restrictions to the threshold values @xmath78 .",
    "these values were computed numerically for all the chemical potentials of the sqm constituents to study , in the next section , the spin polarization in the regime of a strong magnetic field . as it turns out ,",
    "the @xmath0-equilibrium and charge neutrality are satisfied only for magnetic field values below certain threshold . above this , the number density of electrons and @xmath43 quarks are fixed , independently of the magnetic field , and @xmath0-equilibrium will require @xmath105 .",
    "our numerical results confirm that the main contribution to the threshold field comes from @xmath43 quarks , which imply the upper bound @xmath106  g.",
    "in this section we perform a complete numerical study with the aim to determine all the relevant thermodynamical quantities for sqm and discuss its stability , taking into account @xmath0-equilibrium and charge neutrality .",
    "this requires the solution of a system of equations to obtain the chemical potentials of all the species involved in the system .",

    "when the amm are not included , a total polarization is achieved for @xmath120  g. on the other hand , when the amm are taken into account the system can not reach a total spin polarization since for values greater than @xmath112 the density number becomes complex .",
    "the behavior of the magnetization @xmath121 is depicted in fig .",
    "it is always a positive quantity for fields greater than @xmath122 .",
