    "when ce is added as a dilute magnetic impurity into a non - magnetic host , antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath1 between band electrons of the host and the localized 4f electron of ce@xmath2 produces a magnetic - singlet ground state in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "this many - body process , the kondo effect , renormalizes the effective mass of itinerant charge carries that is reflected in a large specific heat sommerfeld coefficient per mole ce and that scales as @xmath3  @xcite , where the kondo temperature @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 is the density of electronic states of the host  @xcite .",
    "the resulting fermi volume of the interacting system is large , i.e. , counts both band electrons of the host and the 4f electron of ce .",
    "in contrast to the well - understood impurity limit , a periodic array of kondo atoms is much more complex . in this dense limit ,",
    "the kondo effect as well as interactions , such as the indirect ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction , between local moments are present . with both kondo and rkky interactions depending on @xmath1 ,",
    "their interplay can be tuned by chemical environment , magnetic field and pressure to give magnetically ordered , superconducting or paramagnetic ground states of the kondo lattice  @xcite .",
    "if kondo screening dominates , then the fermi volume of the heavy quasiparticles also will be large  @xcite .",
    "the surface of this large fermi volume is susceptible to instabilities , such as superconductivity and/or formation of a spin - density wave .",
    "cecu@xmath6si@xmath6 , the first heavy fermion superconductor  @xcite , is an example .",
    "its large fermi volume of itinerant heavy quasiparticles forms unconventional superconductivity , a spin - density wave or both , depending on chemical stoichiometry  @xcite . in the sense that these broken symmetries are the consequence of a fermi - surface instability , the same ( itinerant ) electrons",
    "are involved in both superconductivity and magnetism . on the other hand ,",
    "if the interaction between local moments dominates , local - moment magnetic order develops in a small fermi volume that does not count the localized electrons , and magnetic entropy in the ordered state will be close to that expected from the degeneracy of the localized electrons .",
    "cecu@xmath6ge@xmath6 is an example of the localized limit ; localized 4f electrons order antiferromagnetically near 4k in a well - defined crystal - field doublet manifold .",
    "cecu@xmath6ge@xmath6 becomes superconducting at very high pressures  @xcite , where the kondo effect dominates , and , consequently , magnetism and superconductivity arise from electrons with very different characters , one localized and the other itinerant .",
    "the dense kondo system upd@xmath6al@xmath7 has been proposed to exhibit both localized and itinerant characters of its three 5f electrons , with two of the 5f electrons being localized and ordering antiferromagnetically and one of the 5f electrons being itinerant and participating in coexisting unconventional superconductivity  @xcite . from a theoretical perspective , division of electronic orbitals into localized and itinerant components is possible depending on the competition between intra - atomic coulomb interactions and anisotropic hybridization of 5f electrons  @xcite .",
    "though this mechanism may account for the behavior of u s 5f electrons in upd@xmath6al@xmath7 , it remains to be shown that such competition could lead to simultaneously localized and itinerant characters of a single f electron .",
    "in addition to the relationship between magnetism and superconductivity , the issue of itinerant or localized character of electrons is important for interpreting the nature of quantum criticality that emerges as the neel transition of a kondo lattice is tuned to zero temperature .",
    "the hertz - millis - moriya theory is constructed to account for quantum - critical behavior arising from a zero - temperature spin instability of a large fermi volume  @xcite , and , indeed , transport and thermodynamic properties of cecu@xmath6si@xmath6 that emerge as its spin - density transition is tuned to @xmath8 can be interpreted in this framework  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "behaviors of the kondo lattice systems ybrh@xmath6si@xmath6  @xcite and cecu@xmath9au@xmath10  @xcite near their quantum - critical points have led to qualitatively different models that assume localized 4f electrons  @xcite , and in contrast to cecu@xmath6si@xmath6 , neither of these systems exhibits superconductivity near their quantum - phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the distinction , however , between localized and itinerant magnetic phases is not always straightforward , with some theories arguing that they are distinct phases and others for a continuous transition from localized to itinerant antiferromagnetism , i.e. , from small to strong kondo coupling , as a function of some tuning parameter that also accesses the quantum - critical regime .",
    "cerhin@xmath0 is an example of complexity posed by a kondo lattice . at atmospheric pressure , localized 4f electrons in cerhin@xmath0 order",
    "antiferromagnetically at 3.8  k. studies of dilute ce in larhin@xmath0 show that the kondo - impurity temperature @xmath11 is more than one order of magnitude smaller than t@xmath12 of cerhin@xmath0 at atmospheric pressure  @xcite , consistent with local moment order and the small fermi surface deduced from de haas - van - alphen ( dhva ) experiments  @xcite . whereas , the small impurity @xmath13 would imply a huge sommerfeld coefficient of @xmath14j / mol@xmath15k@xmath16 and negligible kondo compensation of the local moment , the experimental for cerhin@xmath0 above @xmath17 is about 0.4  j / mole@xmath15k@xmath16 ; magnetic entropy below @xmath17 is @xmath18rln2 ; and the order moment of @xmath19 is reduced by about @xmath20 from that of ce in a crystal - field doublet without the kondo effect  @xcite .",
    "together , these observations are inconsistent with naive expectations and suggest that electrons in the kondo lattice are neither simply localized nor itinerant .",
    "this is reflected as well in the response of cerhin@xmath0 to pressure .",
    "modest pressure induces a phase of coexisting superconductivity and local - moment magnetic order that evolves at higher pressures to a superconducting state without magnetic order  @xcite .",
    "applying a magnetic field , however , to this higher pressure superconducting state induces magnetic order that coexists with superconductivity to a critical pressure where the field - induced magnetic order is tuned to @xmath8  @xcite . at this critical pressure ,",
    "transport and thermodynamic properties exhibit strong deviations from those of a heavy landau fermi liquid  @xcite , and de haas - van alphen frequencies of principal orbits increase sharply  @xcite , as if signaling a transition from small - to - large fermi volume , again emphasizing ambiguity in the nature of electrons responsible for superconductivity , magnetism and non - fermi - liquid responses .",
    "as discussed below , specific heat studies of cerhin@xmath0 as a function of temperature , pressure and magnetic field explicitly reveal this ambiguity and allow exploration of its consequences on the symmetry of the superconducting gap .",
    "single crystals of cerhin@xmath0 were grown from in flux as described elsewhere .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction confirmed the hocoga@xmath0 tetragonal structure , which can be viewed as layers of cein@xmath7 and rhin@xmath6 stacked sequentially along the c - axis .",
    "electrical resistance measurements indicated the high quality of these crystals , with a resistivity ratio @xmath21(300k)/ @xmath21(0k ) @xmath22 400 and a residual resistivity of @xmath23 n@xmath24 cm .",
    "specific heat measurements were performed in a hybrid clamp - type pressure cell made of be - cu / nicral in which there was a teflon cup that contained a silicone - fluid pressure transmitting medium , a small piece of sn , whose inductively measured superconducting transition served to determine pressure in the cell at low temperatures , and a sample of cerhin@xmath0 .",
    "the specific heat was determined by ac calorimetry . in this technique ,",
    "an alternating current through a heater , attached to one side of the sample , induced an oscillating change in temperature @xmath25 , detected on the other side of the sample by a calibrated au - fe thermocouple and that is inversely proportional to the sample s specific heat @xmath26 .",
    "this technique is not absolute because the amplitude and phase of temperature oscillations are influenced by heat transported to the surrounding pressure medium .",
    "approximately absolute values of the specific heat of cerhin@xmath0 were obtained by scaling the measured specific heat to that determined earlier by an adiabatic technique  @xcite .",
    "the pressure cell was attached to @xmath27he cryostat that fit into a 9-t superconducting solenoid .",

    "1b )  @xcite .",
    "the first occurs at 1.75  gpa  ( = p1 ) , where the magnetic and superconducting transition temperatures become equal in the absence of an applied magnetic field and the second at p2 where a field - induced magnetic transition is tuned to @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the magnetically ordered phase is completely suppressed for @xmath30 ; whereas , magnetic and superconducting phases coexist on a microscopic scale for @xmath31  @xcite . the abrupt suppression of afm at p1 has been interpreted as an indication of a weakly first - order phase transition between a state in which magnetic order and superconductivity coexist to a purely superconducting phase  @xcite .",
    "when extrapolated below 1.15  gpa , the bulk @xmath29 determined from @xmath32 is zero near 0.5  gpa at which @xmath17 starts to decrease , indicating an interplay between magnetic and superconducting phases .",

    "1b , we also plot @xmath29 and @xmath17 determined from electrical resistivity measurements . at ambient pressure , there is a slight decrease in resistivity below 50  mk possibly due to incomplete filamentary superconductivity ( not shown ) . unlike the bulk @xmath29 that increases gradually with pressure ,",
    "the @xmath29 determined from zero resistance sharply increases above 0.5  gpa , resulting in a large football - shaped difference curve in the two @xmath29s . for pressures above p1 , the two @xmath29s become almost equal . a difference between the bulk and transport @xmath29",
    "also has been reported in a sister compound ceirin@xmath0",
    "@xcite . polishing , etching , and heavy - ion irradiation of the surface of ceirin@xmath0 do not affect the two @xmath29s , ruling out the possibility of surface superconductivity .",
    "chemical substitution , however , narrows the difference between the two @xmath29s , suggesting that a strain may exist locally to affect superconductivity of ceirin@xmath0 and chemical disorder relieves the local strain to make the system more homogeneous  @xcite . in cerhin@xmath0 ,",
    "the difference between bulk and resistive @xmath29s is reversible with decreasing pressure , which indicates an intrinsic response to the coexistence of magnetic and superconducting orders and not an effect of internal strain .",
    "a strain scenario would require large pressure inhomogeneity , at least of order 0.5  gpa even at ambient pressure .",
    "such a large pressure gradient is at odds with independent studies of the hydrostaticity of our pressure medium in which there is a maximum gradient of 0.01 gpa even when the silicone fluid freezes into a glassy state  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the coincidence of bulk and resistive transitions for @xmath30 also is inconsistent with a strain scenario .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the resistive transition arises from magneto - elastic coupling that initially induces filamentary superconductivity at antiferromagnetic domain walls before the sample bulk superconducts at lower temperature .",
    "though specific heat measurements establish two phase transitions , bulk superconductivity and magnetic order , at pressures below p1 , and nmr measurements show that these orders coexist on the scale of a unit cell , neither is able to determine the nature of the electronic state out of which these orders develop . neutron diffraction at pressures to 1.6  gpa show that the size of the ordered moment ( @xmath33 ) is only weakly pressure dependent and close to that of ce@xmath2 in a crystal field doublet , indicating that magnetism in cerhin@xmath0 arises from localized ce 4f spins  @xcite .",
    "the localized nature of ce s 4f electron in the afm state is consistent with de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) experiments on ce - doped larhin@xmath0 , where quantum - oscillation frequencies reflecting a small fermi surface are independent of ce - doping concentration up to stoichiometric cerhin@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "these results argue for local - moment order mediated by the rkky interaction . as a function of pressure , the dhva frequencies of cerhin@xmath0 are unchanged for @xmath31  @xcite , i.e. , the f - electron remains localized so that the coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity should not be viewed as a simple competition for electronic states at the fermi energy . on the other hand , inspection of specific heat data plotted in fig .",
    "1a shows that superconductivity develops in the antiferromagnetic state in which @xmath34 just above @xmath29 is a substantial fraction of @xmath34 just above @xmath17 , that is , neel order has not dramatically suppressed the effective mass of quasiparticles that form cooper pairs .",
    "such enhanced effective mass must come from hybridization of f- and band electrons since there is no enhancement of the effective mass of quasiparticles in non - magnetic larhin@xmath0  @xcite .",

    ", it is not possible to conclude that the 4f electron has become completely delocalized to form a large fermi surface at high pressures ; however , these higher frequencies do correspond closely to those of isostructural , heavy - fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath0 whose fermi - surface topology and size agree well with band calculations that assume itinerancy of the 4f electrons  @xcite .     superconducting transition .",
    "b ) comparison of entropy values at @xmath17 ( solid squares ) and @xmath29 ( solid circles ) as a function of pressure . hashed area marks a zero - field critical pressure p1 ( = 1.75  gpa).,width=283 ]    in the absence of a direct probe of the 4f electron , inferences of its contributions to magnetism and superconductivity are provided by the evolution of magnetic entropy with pressure  see fig .",
    "6 . at ambient pressure",
    ", there is a sharp kink at @xmath17 ( marked by an arrow ) and about @xmath63 of the rln2 spin entropy is recovered near 8  k , where neutron measurements show the onset of short range spin - spin correlations  @xcite .",
    "even though the ground state of cerhin@xmath0 is sensitive to pressure , the entropy below 8  k is almost independent of the applied pressure and ground state .",
    "figure  6b shows how entropy at @xmath29 and @xmath17 evolves as a function of pressure . at 1.05  gpa , entropy of the neel order",
    "dominates , and entropy associated with superconductivity is negligible .",
    "with increasing pressure , entropy due to magnetic order decreases and the lost entropy is transferred to sc entropy .",
    "when pressure is higher than 1.75  gpa , entropy is completely in the superconducting channel .",
    "the transfer of spin entropy from magnetism to superconductivity provides strong evidence that the single ce 4f electron does participate in the two disparate broken symmetries and , further , that superconductivity has a magnetic origin .",
    "the superconducting order parameter in the high - pressure phase of cerhin@xmath0 is most likely d - wave .",
    "nmr measurements show a @xmath51 dependence below @xmath29 in the spin - lattice relaxation rate@xcite ; there is no hebel - slichter peak below @xmath29 ; the upper critical field is pauli limited ; and , as shown in fig .  7 , field - rotation",
    "specific heat measurements under pressure find a four - fold modulation when magnetic field is rotated within ce - in plane .",
    "we note that these experimental evidences also characterize cecoin@xmath0 , where a d - wave order parameter is established  @xcite .     at 2.3 gpa .",
    "measurements are made a fixed temperature of 325  mk and fixed magnetic field of 0.9  t , which is well below the upper critical field .",
    "the solid line is a least - squares fit to a four - fold modulation model : @xmath64 , where c(0)=200 , a=9.3 , a4=0.0856 , b=-0.00243 .",
    "we tentatively attribute the linear - in angle , @xmath65 , contribution to slight misalignment of the crystal.,width=283 ]    in the coexisting phase , the nature of the superconducting order parameter is less clear .",
    "the presence of magnetism as well as proximity to a magnetic critical point has prompted various theoretical predictions , ranging from a generalized d - wave with eight nodal points to a gapless p - wave superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , nqr measurements show that @xmath57 crosses over from a @xmath51 to @xmath66linear dependence deep in the sc state at 1.6  gpa , possibly indicating a gapless p - wave order parameter",
    ". specific heat measurements , however , observe a finite @xmath8 density of states in the coexisting phase , which can also lead to a @xmath66linear crossover .",
    "in addition , field - rotation specific heat measurements have revealed a four - fold oscillation , which is consistent with a d - wave order parameter in the coexisting phase  @xcite . the dependence on magnetic field of @xmath34 in the coexisting phase , however , can not be explained by a d - wave alone , requiring an interplay between magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "as suggested from the evolution of entropy , unconventional superconductivity appears to have a magnetic origin .",
    "a phenomenological model of magnetically mediated superconductivity derives an attractive pairing potential that increases with the generalized momentum- and frequency - dependent magnetic susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "because the magnetic susceptibility diverges at a magnetic quantum - phase transition , the pairing potential will be strongest there , and , indeed , superconductivity in heavy - electron systems typically emerges in proximity to a quantum - phase transition .",
    "the nature , however , of the quantum criticality should influence the dominant pairing channel .",
    "for example , the susceptibility is singular at the * q*-vector defining a spin - density wave that becomes critical at @xmath8 , and this favors d - wave pairing  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "ferromagnetic criticality favors the p - wave channel .",
    "the critical state that emanates from p2 in cerhin@xmath0 is neither that of an sdw nor of ferromagnetism but is associated with criticality of localized 4f electrons  @xcite .",
    "such criticality is consistent with a selective mott or kondo - breakdown type of zero - temperature phase transition  @xcite . unlike an sdw quantum - phase transition ,",
    "fluctuations emerging from this type of unusual quantum - phase transition are not well elaborated but are not expected to be peaked around a particular  * q*. in this case , it is not clear what pairing channel might be favored or , from a theoretical perspective , even if superconductivity should appear .",
    "nevertheless , cerhin@xmath0 appears to provide an example of where this is possible .",
    "the simultaneous localized / itinerant roles of the 4f electron in cerhin@xmath0 seem to be a necessary ingredient in this physics .",
    "specific heat studies of the heavy - fermion compound cerhin@xmath0 reveal a complex interplay between localized and itinerant degrees of freedom of ce s 4f electron .",
    "the evolution of this interplay with applied pressure is emphasized in the response of cerhin@xmath0 to applied magnetic field which shows that the 4f electron remains localized up to a critical pressure p2 . in spite of its local character ,",
    "the 4f electron also participates in creating a state of bulk unconventional superconductivity .",
    "there are many open problems posed by these discoveries , not the least of which is the need for a theoretical basis for interpreting experimental observations .",
    "understanding the physics of cerhin@xmath0 should open new perspectives on other complex systems in which electronic correlations entangle states to create emergent functionalities .",
