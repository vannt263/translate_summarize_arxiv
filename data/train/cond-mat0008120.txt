    "in recent years much attention is being devoted to the properties of semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) . in these systems , carriers are subject to a confining potential in all spatial directions , giving rise to a discrete energy spectrum ( `` artificial atoms '' ) and to novel phenomena of interest for fundamental physics as well as for applications to electronic and optoelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "the extension and the shape of the qd confining potential varies , depending on the nanostructure fabrication technique : the dots that are studied most extensively by optical methods are induced by quantum well ( qw ) thickness fluctuations @xcite , or obtained by spontaneous island formation in strained layer epitaxy @xcite , self - organized growth on patterned substrates @xcite , stressor - induced qw potential modulation @xcite , cleaved edge overgrowth @xcite , as well as chemical self - aggregation techniques @xcite .",
    "the resulting confinement lengths fall in a wide range between 1@xmath1 m and 10 nm .    in spite of the continuing progress ,",
    "all the available fabrication approaches still suffer from the effects of inhomogeneity and dispersion in the dot size , which lead to large linewidths when optical experiments are performed on large qd ensembles .",
    "a major advancement in the field has come from different types of local optical experiments , that allow the investigation of individual quantum dots thus avoiding inhomogeneous broadening @xcite .    among local spectroscopies , the approaches based on scanning near - field optical microscopy ( snom )",
    "@xcite are especially interesting as they bring the spatial resolution well below the diffraction limit of light : with the development of small - aperture optical fiber probes , sub - wavelength resolutions were achieved ( @xmath2 @xcite or @xmath3 @xcite ) and the first applications to nanostructures became possible @xcite . as the resolution increases , local optical techniques in principle allow direct access to the space and energy distribution of quantum states within the dot .",
    "this opens , however , a number of questions regarding the interpretation of these experiments , that were often neglected in the past .",
    "first of all , for spatially inhomogeneous electromagnetic ( em ) fields it is no longer possible to define and measure an absorption coefficient that _ locally _ relates the absorbed power density with the light intensity ( since the susceptibility @xmath4 can not be approximated by a local tensor ) . in the linear regime",
    ", a local absorption coefficient can still be defined , which is however a complicated function that depends on the specific em field distribution @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of near - field spectra therefore requires calculations based on a reasonable assumption for the profile of the em field .    secondly , the quantum states that are actually probed are few - particle states of the interacting electrons and holes photoexcited in the dot . even in the linear regime ,",
    "excitonic effects are known to dominate the optical spectra of dots since coulomb interactions are strongly enhanced by the three - dimensional confinement .",
    "near - field spectra probe exciton wavefunctions , and their spatial coherence and overlap with the em - field profile will determine the local absorption @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show how the above phenomena affect local spectra of qds , with special attention to the case of coupled dots ( `` artificial molecules '' ) where carriers interact across the barrier via tunneling and/or coulomb matrix elements @xcite .",
    "indeed , the optical properties of coupled dots are currently of great interest not only in view of the unavoidable inter - dot interactions occurring in real samples with dense qd packing , but also in view of their relevance for designing novel devices including gates for possible solid - state implementations of quantum information processing @xcite",
    ".    we will show that the relative phase of the exciton wavefunction in adjacent coupled dots ( or in different regions of the same dot ) can induce dramatic changes in the selection rules with respect to far - field spectra : a realistic prediction of these effects require accurate calculations taking into account quantum confinement as well as coulomb interactions .",
    "our theoretical scheme is especially designed to allow a realistic description of the quantum states of the interacting electron and holes photoexcited in the linear regime . in this respect",
    "we improve drastically over previous approaches , which generally focused on a more detailed treatment of the em field distributions @xcite .",
    "our theoretical framework for dots is summarized in section  [ sec : theory ] , while sections  [ sec : results ] and  [ sec : conclusions ] discuss our results and conclusions for single and coupled dots .",
    "in this section , we summarize our theoretical approach for computing local absorption spectra for semiconductor qds .",
    "we first show in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory.sp ] how to compute the single - particle eigenstates for electrons and holes subjected to a three - dimensional confinement potential .",
    "these single - particle states are then used in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory.excitons ] for the calculation of electron - hole ( i.e. , optical ) excitations . in analogy to semiconductor systems of higher dimensionality",
    ", we shall refer to these excitations as _ excitons _ ; the properties of such excitons , however , are not only governed by the attractive electron - hole coulomb interaction but in addition by the strong quantum confinement .",
    "finally , we use in sec .  [",
    "sec : theory.local.absorption ] the above ingredients to derive the equations needed for the calculation of local optical absorption spectra .      in semiconductor qds",
    ", carriers are confined in all three space directions . to simplify our analysis",
    ", we assume that a suitable parameterization of the dot confinement potential is known ( e.g. , from experiment ) and that the confinement potential varies sufficiently slow on the length scale of the lattice constant .",
    "we thus shall make use of the envelope - function approach @xcite ; moreover , since the energy region of our present concern is relatively close to the semiconductor band gap , we describe the material band structure in terms of a single electron and hole band within the usual effective - mass approximation .",
    "more specifically , the envelope - function equation for single electrons and holes reads :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the effective mass and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the confinement potential energy for electrons ( holes ) . following our approach developed earlier @xcite , we numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp ] ) for arbitrary confinement potentials by use of a plane - wave expansion with periodic boundary conditions ( see appendix a ) .",
    "when the dot structure is perturbed by an external light field ( e.g. , laser ) , electron - hole pairs are created which propagate in the presence of the mutual coulomb interaction and of the dot confinement potential . within the present paper ,",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the linear optical response , i.e. , the dynamics of a single electron - hole pair .",
    "then , the exciton dynamics is described by the electron - hole wavefunction @xmath10 , with the squared modulus being the probability of finding the electron at position @xmath11 when the hole is at position @xmath12 .    if we expand the electron - hole ( `` exciton '' ) eigenfunction in terms of single - particle states viz .",
    ":    @xmath13    we obtain the excitonic eigenvalue problem @xcite :    @xmath14    as will be shown in the following , the exciton spectrum @xmath15 directly provides the optical transition energies whereas the excitonic wavefunctions @xmath16 determine the oscillator strengths of the corresponding transitions . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exciton ] ) we have introduced the electron - hole coulomb matrix elements @xcite :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the elementary charge and @xmath19 is the static dielectric constant of the bulk semiconductor ( note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coulomb.eh ] ) we have not considered the electron - hole exchange interaction ) . within our computational approach , we consider in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exciton ] ) typically a basis of 12 states for electrons and holes , respectively , and obtain the excitonic eigenfunctions by direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "when the semiconductor nanostructure is excited by a local near - field probe , the total absorbed power @xmath20 at a given frequency @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the electro - magnetic field distribution of the near - field probe .",
    "within linear response , the induced interband polarization @xmath24 is related to @xmath25 through :    @xmath26    where the non - local electrical susceptibility @xmath27 can be expressed in terms of the excitonic eigenenergies and eigenfunctions @xcite :    @xmath28    here , @xmath29 is the dipole - matrix element of the bulk semiconductor , while we have introduced a small damping constant @xmath30 accounting for the finite lifetime of exciton states due to environment coupling ( e.g. , phonons ) . to derive our final expression , it turns out to be convenient to consider for the elctromagnetic field distribution a given profile @xmath31 centered around the beam position @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "then , the local spectrum for a given tip position @xmath34 can be expressed in the form @xcite ( see also appendix a ) :",
    "@xmath35    where    @xmath36    two limiting cases can be identified . for a spatially homogeneous electromagnetic field ( far - field ) ,",
    "the oscillator strength @xmath37 is given by the spatial average of the excitonic wavefunction , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "in the opposite ( and hypothetical ) limit of an infinitely narrow probe , @xmath39 , one is probing the local value of the exciton wavefunction , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "finally , within the intermediate regime of a narrow but finite probe , @xmath41 is averaged over a region which is determined by the spatial extension of the light beam ; therefore , excitonic transitions which are optically forbidden in the far - field may become visible in the near - field .",
    "in the following sections we consider the interaction of the em field with excitonic states of single and double qds ; for the latter system , we focus particularly on the transition between two isolated qds and a the `` artificial molecule '' , where the electronic states of two qds are strongly overlapping",
    ".      we shall consider a prototypical qd confinement which is composed of a 2d harmonic potential in the @xmath42-plane and a rectangular quantum well along @xmath43 ; such confinement potentials have been demonstrated to be a good approximation for self - assembled quantum dots formed by strained - layer epitaxy .",
    "we focus on cases where the @xmath43-confinement is stronger than the @xmath42 one , so that the confinement potential can be written as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the width of the quantum - well and @xmath46 the band offsets for electrons and holes , respectively . for a single dot the in - plane confinement potential",
    "@xmath47 is of the form :    @xmath48    while for two dots ( i.e. , double dot ) separated by the distance @xmath49 :    @xmath50    with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 the level splittings of the in - plane harmonic potential .",
    "the shape of the double - dot potential has been obtained by matching the parabolas with opposite curvature , such that the potential is continuous and smooth at @xmath53 ; the shape of the resulting potential along the @xmath54- direction is shown , for selected inter - dot distances @xmath49 , in figs .",
    "1(b ) , 1(d ) . material and dot parameters which are used in this paper are listed in table [ table : dot ] ; with this choice of parameters , electron and hole wavefunctions have approximately the same lateral extension , and the qw - induced intersubband splittings are much larger than @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    with our choice of the confinement potential , eq .",
    "( refeq : total.confinement ) , the single - particle energies of a qd are @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the confinement energy of the qw along @xmath43 and @xmath59 is the confienment energy of the 2d single- or double - harmonic potential .",
    "single - particle energies and envelope functions have been computed numerically within a plane - wave scheme . however , for a single qd the 2d eigenstates can be found analytically and are the well - known `` fock - darwin '' states @xcite ( we stress , however , that the extension in the @xmath43-direction is of crucial importance for the calculation of the coulomb matrix elements and the optical properties , and unavoidably has to be taken into account in any realistic calculation ; see also discussion in ref .",
    "for such states @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the principal quantum number , and each level is @xmath62-fold degenerate ; in table  [ table : fock.darwin ] we summarize for convenience some properties of these `` fock - darwin '' states @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the calculated single - particle energies for electrons and holes for the more complex case of a double qd with the confinement potential given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : confinement.double ] ) and with parameters listed in table [ table : dot ] .",
    "the lower panels ( figs .",
    "1(b , d ) ) show the confinement potentials for electrons and holes at selected inter - dot distances . obviously , for large dot separations @xmath49",
    "( @xmath63 nm ) the system can be well approximated by two separate qds ; in this regime the equidistance of the excited states and the correct degeneracy of the fock - darwin states is obtained .",
    "when @xmath49 is small enough that carriers have sufficient energy to overcome ( or tunnel through ) the barrier between the two dots , the degeneracy is removed , and the energy levels have a non - monotonous behaviour which reflects the transition from two separated carrier systems to a single one , and is similar to the one found , e.g. for coupled qws @xcite . for the smallest dot distances the double - dot potential merges into a single - dot potential , and",
    "the fock - darwin states of a single dot are recovered .      before turning to the analysis of near - field spectra , we shortly discuss the limiting case of very broad em field distribution ( far - field spectra ) .",
    "this discussion allows us to elucidate the role of the electron - hole coulomb correlation , particularly in the transition from two separate `` artificial atoms '' to an `` artificial molecule '' .",
    "far - field spectra can be obtained in the formalism of sec .",

    "2 and 3 show the calculated far - field spectra for a double qd as a function of the dot distance @xmath49 .",
    "we first concentrate on the calculations where coulomb correlations were artificially set to zero ( figs .",
    "2(a ) and 3(a ) ) : because of symmetry , only a small fraction of all possible electron - hole transitions is visible ; from eq .",
    "( [ eq : far.field ] ) and using @xmath65 we obtain that optical transitions are only allowed between electron and hole single - particle states with opposite angular momentum .",
    "indeed , for large distances ( uncoupled qds ) only three strong absorption peaks are observed , with an energy splitting of approximately @xmath66 ; the intensity of the peaks increases with energy ( with ratio @xmath67 ) .",
    "these can be attributed to transitions between electrons and holes single - particle states ( see table [ table : fock.darwin ] ) of the @xmath68 symmetry ( peak at @xmath69 mev ) , the @xmath70 symmetry ( peak at @xmath71 mev ) , and the @xmath72 and @xmath73 symmetries ( peak at @xmath74 mev ) .    when symmetry is reduced , either because of an asymmetric confinement potential or by the presence of an external inhomogeneous em - field ( as will be discussed later ) , the selection rules noted above are relaxed . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath49 is reduced and the two qds begin to interact , the calculated spectra show a much richer structure , as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) and 3(a ) , reflecting the reduction of built - in symmetry . obviously , when @xmath75 , the usual selection rules of a single - qd are recovered .    when coulomb interaction is included , inspection of the exciton wavefunctions @xmath76 ( obtained from the solutions of eq",
    "( [ eq : exciton ] ) ) shows that a number of different single - particle transitions contributes to each excitonic state @xcite .",
    "coulomb interaction affects the optical spectra [ see figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) ] in several ways .",
    "firstly , because of the attractive electron - hole interaction leading to the `` bound '' excitonic states , we observe a red - shift of the peaks ; peak separation is barely affected , however , at least for large @xmath49 .",
    "secondly , we observe a redistribution of the oscillator strength ; for isolated qds the three main peaks are of similar height . in general ,",
    "oscillator strength is transferred from higher to lower peaks .",
    "this effect is particularly strong , e.g. , in the doublet which splits from the lowest peak when the two qds approach ; contrary to the uncorrelated case , the heighest partner is very weak .",
    "finally , coulomb interaction is responsible for the appearance of additional lines ( see , e.g. , for @xmath77 nm the peak at 70 mev ) . while the first two effects ( red - shift and transfer of oscillator strength ) are similar to what is found in the absorption spectra of semiconductor quantum wires , and thus can be considered as a general fingerprint of coulomb correlations in the optical properties of semiconductor nanostructures , the origin of the additional peaks is best discussed in connection with the calculated near - field optical spectra and , therefore , is postponed to the next section .      in this section",
    "we discuss the local absorption spectra of single and coupled qds . because of the narrow well width of the dot confinement potential ( see table [ table : dot ] ) , the em profile of the near - field probe along @xmath43 has an only minor influence on the results , and we use :    @xmath78    the spatial resolution of the electromagnetic field distribution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : em.profile ] ) is then approximately given by the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the gaussian ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) .",
    "since the gaussian acts as an envelope on @xmath80 , in the intermediate regime of a narrow but finite @xmath81 the spatial average only extends over the region where the gaussian is non - vanishing .",
    "since the extension of the quantum states under investigation is of the order of a few tens of nano - meters ( see also figs .",
    "5 and 8 , to be discussed below ) , in our calculations we consider three different regimes of spatial resolution : _",
    "i ) _ a regime where the fwhm is much larger than the extension of the quantum states ( as a characteristic value we use @xmath82 nm ) ; _ ii ) _ a regime where the fwhm is comparable to the extension of the relevant quantum states ( we use @xmath83 nm ) ; _ iii ) _ a regime with an extremely narrow probe beam ( we use @xmath84 nm ) .",
    "calculations performed in this latter ( unphysical ) regime are used for illustrative purposes to obtain a `` cartography '' of the exciton wavefunction , as discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : theory.local.absorption ] .",
    "we finally notice that the excitonic bohr radius @xmath85 nm for gaas .      in fig .",
    "4 we report the calculated local absorption spectra @xmath86 for a single qd as a function of the tip position .",
    "the tip is swept along one direction , passing through the center of the qd .    in figs .",
    "4(a  c ) we show the calculated spectra neglecting coulomb interaction . for the highest spatial resolution",
    "4(a ) ] , the local absorption at photon energy @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "given the energy splitting @xmath88 mev for holes and @xmath89 mev for electrons , we can attribute the triplet of peaks at @xmath69 mev to the single - particle transitions involving the @xmath68 state of electrons and the @xmath68 , @xmath70 , and @xmath90 states ( in order of increasing energy ) of holes ( see also table [ table : fock.darwin ] ) ; analogously , the triplet at @xmath91 mev is attributed to the transitions involving the @xmath70 state of electrons and the @xmath68 , @xmath70 , and @xmath90 hole states ; indeed , in fig .",
    "4(a ) the localization of the absorption peaks is suggestive of the @xmath92- , @xmath93- or @xmath49-type symmetry of the corresponding fock - darwin states .",
    "these features are still present at the intermediate resolution [ fig .",
    "4(b ) ] , but disappear at the opposite limit of a broad probe [ figs .",
    "this is expected , since , when a localized em - field is present , the symmetry of the whole system ( nanostructure+em - field ) is lower than that of the nanostructure ( except when the probe is centered in the symmetry center of the structure ) , and far - field selection rules are relaxed .",
    "when the probe is broadened , however , the built - in symmetry of the structure is recovered , and optical far - field selection rules ( i.e. , optical transitions only between electron and hole states with opposite angular momentum @xmath94 ) apply ; therefore , the spectra are almost identical to those of two separated dots in far - field spectroscopy , already discussed in figs .  2 and 3 .    when we compare figs .",
    "4(a  c ) with figs .",
    "4(d  f ) , we find that coulomb interaction induces several effects which are expected on the basis of the discussion of the far - field spectra .",
    "in particular , we find _",
    "i ) _ an almost rigid redshift of the spectra ; _ ii ) _ a transfer of oscillator strength from transitions at higher energies to those at lower energies ; _ iii ) _ the appearance of new features in the optical spectra . to discuss the origin of these new optical features caused by coulomb interactions ,",
    "let us consider , e.g. , the optical peaks at photon energy @xmath95 mev ( figs .",
    "4(d  f ) ) : they are quite strong at @xmath84 nm ( fig",
    ".  4(d ) ) , almost disappear at @xmath83 nm ( fig .",
    "4(e ) ) , and are visible again in the far field limit ( fig .",
    "such a behaviour is rather unexpected and noticeably differs from that of other transitions , which with increasing @xmath81 either remain strong or gradually disappear due to symmetry reasons , as discussed above . to investigate the origin of this non - monotonic dependence , in the following we analyze the three excitons within the corresponding energy range .",
    "figure 5 shows a contour plot of the respective exciton wavefunction @xmath96 . apparently , in fig .",
    "5(a ) the exciton has @xmath92-type symmetry , whereas the other two electron - hole states have @xmath93-type symmetry . ( because of the periodicity box used in our calculations , the two - fold degenerate @xmath93-type exciton wavefunctions have cartesian rather than cylinder symmetry ; note that , since the presence of the near - field tip destroys the cylinder symmetry , the wavefunctions shown in fig .  5 indeed form a natural basis ;",
    "see also table [ table : fock.darwin ] ) .",
    "next , we note that the average @xmath97 of the @xmath93-type exciton wavefunctions is zero . since with increasing @xmath81 the radius within which the exciton eigenfunctions @xmath80 are averaged increases , we expect for these @xmath93-type functions with increasing @xmath81 a monotonically decreasing behavior . the exciton shown in fig",
    "5(a ) , on the other hand , has a non - zero average and is therefore visible in both the optical far- and near - field .",
    "a closer inspection of the exciton wavefunction @xmath76 reveals that the largest contribution stems from the transition between the @xmath68 state of electrons and the @xmath73 state of holes , but there is also a noticeable contribution from the @xmath68-@xmath68 and @xmath70-@xmath70 electron - hole transitions .",
    "indeed , only the latter contributions couple in the far - field to the light field .",
    "in the regime of finite resolution , there is an optimal cancellation when the fwhm of the em near field ( i.e. @xmath98 ) becomes equal to the bohr radius .",
    "this is clearly depicted in fig .  6 , where , in order to facilitate our discussion , we have introduced the quantity @xmath99 , which provides a measure of the relative contribution of each exciton to the absorption spectra . fig .",
    "6 shows @xmath100 for the three excitons",
    "( shown fig .",
    "5 ) within the energy region of 65 mev : we observe that with increasing @xmath81 , the @xmath93-type functions ( open circles ) indeed vanish monotonically , whereas for the @xmath92-type exciton ( full circles ) there exists an optimal cancellation when the fwhm of the em field distribution becomes approximately equal to the bohr radius . in spite of the specific carrier states of a single parabolic qd",
    ", we expect that such non - monotonic behavior appears quite generally in semiconductor nanostructures where carrier states are confined on a length scale comparable to the bohr radius , and thus provides a striking fingerprint of coulomb correlations in the optical near - field spectra ( we find similar behavior in our calculations for the near - field spectra of coupled qds discussed below ) .      in figure 7",
    "we show the calculated local absorption spectra @xmath101 for a double qd for selected values of the interdot distance and @xmath81 .",
    "the tip of the probe is swept along the direction which passes through the centers of the two qds .",
    "let us first concentrate on the results with @xmath84 nm and with the coulomb interaction taken into account ( figs .  7(d , g , j ) ) .",
    "with decreasing interdot distance we observe the transition from a system where the energetically lowest exciton states are almost localized in the spatially separated minima of the two dots , to a system where the electron - hole states extend over the whole nanostructure . here ,",
    "the @xmath92-like ground - state excitons of fig .  7(j ) split up into a `` bonding '' and an `` anti - bonding '' state ( fig .",
    "7(d ) ) . by comparing figs .",
    "7(d ) and 7(f ) , we find that in the optical far - field only the symmetric ground state exciton couples to the light field .",
    "next , we discuss the optical features at the photon energy of @xmath69 mev for @xmath102 nm . as in the case of the single dot , these features show a non - monotonic dependence on the probe width . as can be inferred from the calculations with @xmath84 nm , there are several excitonic states contributing to the spectral features in this energy range ; fig .",
    "8 shows the excitonic wavefunction of two states out of the six states with @xmath103 mev for for @xmath102 nm ; it can be inferred that for a spatial resolution of the near - field probe comparable to the excitonic bohr radius ( @xmath85 nm ) there is again an optimal cancellation .",
    "this is a remarkable finding , because it clearly demonstrates that such a behaviour indeed is a general characteristics of semiconductor nanostructures , and does not depend on peculiar symmetries of the confining potential .",
    "we have analyzed theoretically the interaction between a model near - field probe and a zero - dimensional heterostructure : quantum confinement of the electron and hole states , as well as their coulomb interaction in the linear regime are fully included in our description .",
    "we have specifically considered single and coupled semiconductor quantum dots , and shown that absorption is strongly influenced by the spatial interference of the exciton wavefunctions , which depends on the spatial extension of the light beam . as a consequence , near - field experiments on quantum dots are predicted to display unexpected spectral features whose dependence on spatial resolution is highly non - trivial .    when combined with an appropriate choice of the em field distribution ,",
    "our approach provides the necessary tool for interpretation of near - field absorption spectra of quantum dots as the spatial resolution of experiments becomes comparable with the bohr radius of the exciton in the nanostructure .",

    "<S> we investigate theoretically the spatial dependence of the linear absorption spectra of single and coupled semiconductor quantum dots , where the strong three - dimensional quantum confinement leads to an overall enhancement of coulomb interaction and , in turn , to a pronounced renormalization of the excitonic properties . </S>",
    "<S> we show that because of such coulomb correlations and the spatial interference of the exciton wavefunctions unexpected spectral features appear whose intensity depends on spatial resolution in a highly non - monotonic way when the spatial resolution is comparable with the excitonic bohr radius . </S>",
    "<S> we finally discuss how the optical near - field properties of double quantum dots are affected by their coupling .    </S>",
