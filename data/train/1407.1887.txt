    "solar flares are explosive phenomena which release magnetic energy stored in the solar corona as thermal and kinetic energy of the plasma . because solar flares sometimes cause interplanetary disturbances and impact our terrestrial environment , it is important to understand the mechanism of solar flares also from the practical point of view",
    ". there are numerous observational studies and simulations which attempted to reveal the onset mechanism of solar flares ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . from these previous studies",
    ", it is widely accepted that magnetic reconnection plays important roles in the triggering process of solar flares ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the underlying mechanism of flare onset remains elusive , and the predictability of flare occurrence remains limited .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed several flare events observed by the solar optical telescope ( sot ; @xcite ) onboard the hinode satellite ( @xcite ) , in order to elucidate the flare trigger mechanism .",
    "they investigated the spatio - temporal correlation between the detailed magnetic field structure and the chromospheric pre - flare emission at the central part of flaring regions for several hours prior to the onset of flares .",
    "they found that the magnetic shear angle in the flaring regions exceeded 70 degrees , as well as that characteristic magnetic disturbances developed at the centers of flaring regions in the pre - flare phase .",
    "the observed signatures strongly support the flare trigger mechanism presented by @xcite , who proposed that solar flares can be triggered by the interaction between the sheared arcade and one of two types of small magnetic structures : `` opposite - polarity ( op ) '' and `` reversed - shear ( rs ) '' .    because of the limitation of the sot field of view ( fov ) , only four data sets were utilizable in @xcite . increasing the number of events",
    "is required for more precisely verifying the trigger model proposed by @xcite .",
    "solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ; @xcite ) observes the full disk of the sun and all flares , although its spatial resolution is lower than that of hinode / sot . therefore , in this paper , we evaluated whether the data sets obtained by sdo are usable for the detailed analysis of small magnetic structure and chromospheric emission in the pre - flare phase .",
    "we choose the m6.6 flare which occurred on 13 february 2011 and was observed both by hinode and sdo , as a sample event .",
    "@xcite already analyzed this event using hinode data , and here we checked whether we can obtain their same conclusions using only the sdo data . if we can obtain the same conclusion with @xcite , it would indicate that we will be able to extend the analysis methods of @xcite to events seen by sdo .",
    "this would substantially expand the number of events available for study with these methods .",
    "in addition , we also extend our vector magnetic field analysis of the 13 february 2011 flare to earlier phase , which could not be analyzed in the previous study with the hinode data alone .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the sampled data sets and their analysis method are described in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "we compared the results with hinode and sdo , and the possibility of new analysis with the sdo data sets is presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss the interpretation of the results in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our study in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the active region ( ar ) noaa 11158 appeared in the southern hemisphere near solar disc center on 11 february 2011 .",
    "although a multitude of flares including one x - class flare and five m - class flares were produced in the active region , we focused on the m6.6 flare which occurred on february 13 in this paper .",
    "the onset time of the m6.6 flare was 17:28 ut according to the soft x - ray data obtained by goes ( geostationary operational environment ) 1 - 8 .",
    "the m6.6 flare was already analyzed in @xcite and @xcite with hinode / sot data , and they concluded that the flare was triggered by rs - type small magnetic disturbance that appeared on the major polarity inversion line ( pil ) of the central bipole of the active region .",
    "the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; @xcite ) and the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) onboard the sdo satellite also observed the active region before and after the m6.6 flare .    in the previous study @xcite",
    ", they employed ca ii h line ( 3968 ) filtergrams and stokes - v / i images in the na d1 line ( 5896 ) obtained by hinode / sot .",
    "the ca ii h line is sensitive to emission from the upper chromosphere .",
    "the m6.6 flare was observed in these wavelengths and at a cadence of about five minutes .",
    "unfortunately , there is a data gap from 13:15 ut to 15:00 ut .",
    "the fov of sot was limited to @xmath0 for the narrowband filter imager ( nfi ) and @xmath1 for the broadband filter imager ( bfi ) , as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "the spatial resolutions of the nfi and bfi are about @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "they also used the vector magnetograms obtained by the spectro - polarimeter ( sp ) of sot @xcite .",
    "the sp observed the full - polarization states ( stokes - i , q , u , and v ) of two magnetically sensitive fe lines at @xmath4 and @xmath5 at 16:00:04 - 16:32:25 ut on february 13 .",
    "the fov of the vector magnetograms was @xmath6 .",
    "sdo observed the sun with a full disk fov ( @xmath7 ) at 45 seconds cadence before and throughout the flare .",
    "the spatial resolution is @xmath8 for hmi and @xmath9 for aia . in this study , we choose aia continuum and c iv line ( 1600 ) filtergrams and hmi filter magnetograms in the fe i line ( 6173 ) , which are sensitive to emission from the transition region and upper chromosphere , and photospheric magnetic field , respectively .",
    "we also used hmi vector magnetograms in the fe i line ( 6173 ) at 12 minutes cadence , in order to measure the magnetic shear angle of the active region .",
    "these vector magnetograms were extracted from sharp ( spaceweather hmi active region patche ) data series in which the @xmath10 ambiguity was resolved and the magnetic field vector has been remapped to a lambert cylindrical equal - area projection . table [ tab : table1 ] indicates the summary of the filtergraph instrumentation and each parameter of hinode / sot and sdo / hmi , aia .",
    ".summary of the filtergraph instrumentation and each parameter of hinode / sot and sdo / hmi , aia [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the temporal evolution of the magnetic field strength , the trend that the field strength in the trigger region increased until the onset of the flare is consistent between both measurements",
    ". however , the absolute values of the magnetic field strength in the sdo measurements are smaller those from hinode .",
    "we inferred that a difference in figure [ fig : fig4](b , c ) might be due to the difference of the measurement method between sdo / hmi and hinode / sot .",
    "sdo obtains magnetic field by filtergraph observation while hinode performs spectroscopic observations with sot / sp .",
    "therefore , we think that the values measured by hinode are more accurate than the values measured by sdo .",
    "however , we should note that the trend of the temporal evolution of the los magnetic field strength is similar between hinode and sdo , and both observations clearly showed features of the rs - type magnetic configuration .",
    "it indicates that sdo data are utilizable for the analysis of the flare trigger .",
    "we analyzed an m6.6 flare that occurred on 13 february 2011 with sdo data and investigated the consistency of the qualitative and quantitative features of the flare - trigger field with our previous study ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used hmi vector and filter magnetograms and aia 1600 images , and we detected the trigger region with sdo data .",
    "the results of our measurement of @xmath11 and @xmath12 satisfy the rs - type condition .",
    "we also evaluated the magnetic field strength in the trigger region , and confirmed that the features of the temporal evolution of the los magnetic field strength calculated with sdo data were consistent with those derived from hinode data , although the absolute value of the magnetic intensity is rather weaker than that of the hinode observations .",
    "therefore , we concluded that the analysis method proposed in the previous study is applicable even to sdo data .",
    "we also demonstrated that the trigger region is detectable with sdo although the spatial resolution and wavelength observed by hinode and sdo are different .",
    "moreover , we performed an analysis of the temporal evolution of @xmath11 & @xmath12 and the transverse magnetic field strength with sdo data , and we found a rapid increase of the transverse magnetic field strength after the flare onset .    based on the results above , we estimated the number of events , which are utilizable for our flare trigger study with sdo .",
    "we selected events from all flares observed by sdo on the basis of the following criteria ; ( 1 ) the flare occurred on the solar disk and was located within @xmath13 from the disk center at least six hours before the onset time .",
    "( 2 ) the magnitude of the flare is larger than m5.0 .",
    "( 3 ) there are continuous and steady data sets for the hmi filter and vector magnetograms and aia 1600 images .",
    "we found that eleven x - class flares and twenty m - class flares meet our criteria between 11 february 2011 and 31 january 2014 .",
    "it suggests that sufficient sdo data are available for a statistical analysis of the flare trigger process , although we have to be cautious judgement for the applicability of our method to events with more complicated magnetic field compared to the sample event .",
    "the analysis of the temporal evolution of the angles @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the los field strength and transverse magnetic field are important to understand the critical conditions for triggering flares .",
    "the high cadence of sdo data is an advantage for such an analysis , and may be effective for revealing the flare trigger mechanism .",
    "a statistical analysis of many flare events is required to examine the competing flare trigger models , and the high - quality data obtained by sdo is powerful for that purpose .",
    "sdo data are useful also for flare prediction experiment . on the other hand",
    ", the resolution of sdo might not be enough to track small elements forming in the flare - trigger field .",
    "therefore , the combined analysis of hinode and sdo will be more useful for the study of flare trigger processes .",
    "the hmi and aia data have been used courtesy of nasa / sdo and the aia and hmi science teams .",
    "hinode is a japanese mission developed and launched by isas / jaxa , which collaborates with naoj as a domestic partner and with nasa and stfc ( uk ) as international partners .",
    "scientific operation of the hinode mission is conducted by the hinode science team organized at isas / jaxa .",
    "this team mainly consists of scientists from institutes in the partner countries .",
    "support for the post - launch operation is provided by jaxa and naoj ( japan ) , stfc ( uk ) , nasa , esa , and nsc ( norway ) .",
    "this work was partly carried out at the naoj hinode science center , which is supported by the grants - in - aid for creative scientific research  the basic study of space weather prediction \" ( head investigator : k. shibata ) from the ministry of education , culture sports , science and technology ( mext ) , japan , by generous donations from sun microsystems , and by naoj internal funding .",
