    "quantum teleportation is an important process in quantum information theories@xcite .",
    "this process enables us to transmit an unknown quantum state from a sender , called alice , to a remote recipient , called bob , via dual classical channels .",
    "bennett et al have shown this process firstly in ref.@xcite about fifteen years ago . in this",
    "paper authors used an einstein - podolsky - rosen state @xmath11 is not the only two - qubit state which allows a perfect quantum teleportation .",
    "any states that are local - unitary(lu ) equivalent with @xmath12 also can be used as quantum channels for the perfect teleportation .",
    "this set of states forms a set of maximally entangled states .",
    "subsequently , quantum teleportation using three - qubit quantum channels are discussed . in three - qubit system",
    "it is well - known that there are two lu - inequivalent types of the maximally entangled states , called greenberger - horne - zeilinger(ghz)@xcite and w@xcite states whose general expressions are @xmath13 the perfect two - party quantum teleportation with exact ghz state in eq.([ghzw1 ] ) with @xmath14 .",
    "] was discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , authors in ref.@xcite discussed three - party teleportation ( alice , bob , cliff ) with the ghz state . this can be used as an imperfect quantum cloning machine@xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown@xcite that not only ghz state @xmath15 can be used as quantum channels for the perfect two - party teleportation . as shown in ref.@xcite both @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "have @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a groverian entanglement measure@xcite .",
    "motivated from the fact that @xmath16 and @xmath17 have same groverian entanglement measure , authors in ref.@xcite have shown that the state @xmath20 and @xmath21 are arbitrary normalized one - qubit states , has also @xmath18 and it can be used as a perfect two - party teleportation .    the fact that both @xmath16 and @xmath17 allow the perfect two - party teleportation naturally arises the following question : which state is better if noisy channels are introduced in the process of teleportation ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address this issue by solving analytically a master equation in the lindbald form@xcite @xmath22 + \\sum_{i , \\alpha } \\left(l_{i,\\alpha } \\rho l_{i,\\alpha}^{\\dagger } - \\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\ { l_{i,\\alpha}^{\\dagger } l_{i,\\alpha } , \\rho \\right\\ } \\right)\\ ] ] where the lindbald operator @xmath23 acts on the @xmath24th qubit and describes decoherence , where @xmath25 denotes the pauli matrix of the @xmath24th qubit with @xmath26 .",
    "the constant @xmath27 is approximately equals to the inverse of decoherence time .",
    "the master equation approach is shown to be equivalent to the usual quantum operation approach for the description of open quantum system@xcite .        to reduce the effect of the noisy channels in the teleportation process",
    "the special purification protocols have been developed in ref.@xcite . via this purification process for the noisy quantum channel one can increase the fidelity of teleportation .",
    "one can also directly compute the fidelity between initial unknown state and final state .",
    "this was discussed in ref.@xcite when two - qubit epr quantum channel interacts with various noisy channels .",
    "the quantum circuit for teleportation with @xmath12 through noisy channel is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . the two top lines belong to alice , while the bottom one belongs to bob .",
    "the dotted box denotes noisy channel .",
    "although different noisy channels were discussed in ref.@xcite , we will concentrate on the noisy channel which makes the quantum channel to be mixed because our main purpose is comparison of @xmath16 with @xmath28 in the teleportation process .",
    "how much quantum information is lost due to noisy channel can be measured by fidelity between @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in order to quantify this quantity",
    "it is more convenient to use the density matrix .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "then the density matrix for output state reduces to @xmath33\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is partial trace over alice s qubits and @xmath35 is an unitary operator implemented by quantum circuit in fig .",
    "1 . in eq.([out1 ] ) @xmath36 denotes a quantum operation which maps from @xmath37 to @xmath38 due to noisy channel .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath38 can be derived by solving the master equation . then the quantity which measures how much information is preserved or lost",
    "can be written as @xmath39 which is the square of the usual fidelity @xmath40 .",
    "thus @xmath41 implies the perfect teleportation .",
    "if @xmath42 becomes larger and larger , this indicates that we lost quantum information more and more .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we consider the two - party quantum teleportation with @xmath16 as quantum channel when noisy channel makes @xmath16 to be mixed state .",
    "solving the master equation ( [ lindbald ] ) analytically , we compute @xmath43 in eq.([fidelity1 ] ) explicitly when lindbald operators are ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and isotropy respectively . in section iii calculation in previous section is repeated with changing the quantum channel from @xmath16 to @xmath28 . in section iv the results of section ii and section iii are compared with each other .",
    "it is shown that the answer of the question `` which state is more robust in the noisy channel ? ''",
    "is completely dependent on the type of the noisy channel . in ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , for example , @xmath16 preserves more information than @xmath17 while reverse situation occurs in ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) channel .",
    "the situation in ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) channel is more delicate .",
    "when the multiplication of noisy parameter with time parameter , i.e. @xmath44 , is small , @xmath17 is slightly more robust than @xmath16 . if , however , @xmath44 becomes larger , @xmath16 preserves more information than @xmath17 . in isotropy noisy with @xmath45 the average of @xmath43 over all input state @xmath29 becomes identical for @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in section",
    "iv we give a brief conclusion .",
    "also we discuss in this section a relation between average fidelity and entanglement for the mixed state quantum channels .",
    "in this section we would like to explore the effect of the noisy channels when the teleportation is performed with @xmath16 .",
    "it is convenient to write the unknown state @xmath29 to be teleported as a bloch vector on a bloch sphere in a form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the polar and azimuthal angles .    the quantum circuit for teleportation with @xmath16 is shown in fig .",
    "the three top lines belong to alice , while the bottom one belongs to bob .",
    "the dotted box denotes noisy channel . comparing fig . 2 to fig . 1",
    "there appears one more control - not gate between the unknown state and ghz state .",

    "4 it is sufficient to introduce the same - axis noisy channels .",

    "for example , let us consider the teleportation with epr state depicted in fig .",

    "it is also equally interest to examine the same noisy channels in other places such as noisy channels during bell s measurement or the unitary operation .",
    "the most important point we would like to explore in the future is to understand the physical reason why and how the robustness of ghz and w states is dependent on the noisy - types . in our opinion",
    "the most nice approach to understand the physical reason is to investigate the entanglement of the mixed states @xmath62 and @xmath134 .",
    "for example , let us consider the quantum teleportation through the noisy channels with epr state for brevity , which is fully discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this case when the quantum channel is subject to @xmath168 , @xmath175 or @xmath169 noisy channels , the average fidelity @xmath91 is always same with eq.([boso1 ] ) , while the isotropic noisy channel gives @xmath176 then we think that an appropriate entanglement measure should have following properties .",
    "the measure for the mixed state @xmath177 generated by @xmath168 , @xmath175 and @xmath169 noisy channels should decay to zero at @xmath159 because @xmath156 implies that the mixed states do not play any role as quantum channels .",
    "by same reason the measure for the mixed state @xmath178 generated by the isotropic noisy channel should vanish at @xmath179 .",
    "if we take a groverian entanglement measure @xmath180@xcite as an entanglement measure , there is another constraint @xmath181 at @xmath108 because the groverian measure for the pure epr state is @xmath182 . as a result",
