    "* the same holds if @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath10 , @xmath8 , respectively ( @xcite ) .    in this note",

    "if in ( [ quasidef ] ) the blocks @xmath1 are allowed to be only positive semidefinite then @xmath2 will naturally be called _ quasi - semidefinite_. these matrices need not to be invertible .",
    "it is relatively easy to characterise the nonsingularity of a quasi - semidefinite matrix , see proposition [ singularity ] below . giving estimates for the gap at zero is more involved and this note offers some results in this direction . since the size of the spectral gap at zero",
    "is bounded from below by @xmath11 we will give various bounds for this quantity in terms of the blocks @xmath12 where @xmath1 are only positive semidefinite and the properties of @xmath6 come into play .",
    "it is known from @xcite that the invertibility of @xmath6 carries over to @xmath2 , but no bound for @xmath13 was provided there .",
    "some bounds for @xmath13 were given in @xcite .",
    "as a technical tool we derive a bound for the matrix @xmath14 with @xmath1 positive semidefinite which might be of independent interest .",
    "we also sketch a related functional calculus for such products .",
    "more specifically , the present article provides the following .    1 .   a bound for @xmath14 with @xmath1 positive semidefinite .",

    "there we have @xmath18 in ( [ quasidef ] ) , but @xmath19 is not necessarily positive definite .",
    "in particular , we will illustrate how changing boundary conditions can remove spurious eigenvalues from the gap .",
    "this is a specific , thoroughly worked out example on how to deal successfully with what is called spectral pollution .",
    "let us remark that the variety of special cases as well as techniques which we use illustrate the fact that we did not succeed in obtaining a unified framework for spectral gap estimates for general quasi - definite matrices .",
    "quasi - semidefinite matrices and their infinite dimensional analogs have important applications in mathematical physics .",
    "although we here have no space to discuss the relevant models in detail , we would like to convey an impression of the questions arising in this context .",
    "these have been the motivation for much of the research presented here .",
    "certain types of dirac operators are important examples . in these cases",
    "the nonsingularity of @xmath2 is typically due to the one of @xmath6 ( see @xcite where this phenomenon was dubbed off - diagonal dominance )",
    ".    another particular motivation are quantum mechanical models of disordered solids .",
    "while this is a well established research field , recently there has been interest in such models which give rise to operators with block - structure , see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite . for some of these models",
    "the block structure is a consequence of the dirac - like symmetry arising in hamiltonians describing graphene .",
    "let us describe some of the specific spectral features which are of interest in this context .",
    "we consider several instances of _ one - parameter hermitian pencils _ @xmath20 .",
    "the well known _ monotonicity property _ ,",
    "namely that the eigenvalues of @xmath21 grow monotonically in @xmath9 , if @xmath6 is positive semidefinite can , at least partly , be carried over to quasi - definite matrices as show the properties ( a ) , ( b ) listed above . here a question of particular importance is whether and how fast the spectral gap increases as @xmath9 grows .",
    "several theorems of this paper provide answers to this question in specific situations .",
    "as mentioned , certain physical models of disordered systems give rise to block - structured operator families . in this context",
    ", estimates have to take into account the following two important aspects .",
    "+ ( i )  the size of the original physical system is macroscopic , i.e.  essentially infinite .",
    "a mathematical understanding of the physical situation is  as a rule  only possible by analysing larger and larger finite sample systems which describe the original physical situation in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this leads to finite matrices or to operators with compact resolvent . in any case",
    ", effectively one can reduce the focus on a finite number , say @xmath22 , of eigenvalues , when analysing monotonicity properties .",
    "however , @xmath22 is not fixed but growing unboundedly as one passes to larger and larger sample scales .",
    "thus , efficient estimates on spectral gaps ( or derivatives of eigenvalues ) are not allowed to depend on the system size  expressed in the dimension of the matrix or the number of eigenvalues @xmath22 .",
    "we will pay special attention to this issue in the following .",
    "( ii )   due to the fact that one wants to model a disordered system , with a large number of degrees of freedom , there is in fact not just _",
    "one _ coupling constant @xmath23 , but rather a whole collection @xmath24 of them .",
    "thus the considered operator pencil is originally of the form @xmath25 a one - parameter family arises if one freezes all coupling constants except for one . as a consequence , one is not dealing with one fixed unperturbed operator @xmath19 , but rather with a whole collection of them , depending on the background configuration of the ( other ) coupling constants @xmath26 .",
    "for this reason it would be desirable to obtain estimates on the spectral gap which do not depend on specific features of @xmath19 .",
    "+ the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we provide certain basic preliminary estimates for quasi - semidefinite matrices . in section [ quasi ]",
    "the main results concerning the spectral gap size of such matrices are stated .",
    "these results are formulated for finite matrices . in section [ unbounded ]",
    "we explain which results carry immediately over to the setting of ( possibly unbounded ) operators defined as quadratic forms .",
    "this includes the mentioned generalisation of an estimate from @xcite , as well as a comparison with bounds obtained in @xcite . in section [ stokes matrix ]",
    "we consider stokes matrices . by reduction to a quadratic eigenvalue problem we ( i ) prove monotonicity properties of the eigenvalues ( but _ not _ as it would be naively expected from cases ( a ) and ( b ) above ) , then ( ii ) give a tight bound for the two eigenvalues closest to zero .",
    "the last section considers a special class of finite difference matrices , not necessarily quasi - definite , studied in @xcite .",
    "here we show that a stable spectral gap at zero can be achieved by an appropriate tuning of boundary conditions .",
    "similar phenomena , yet without rigorous proofs , are numerically observed on related models with random diagonal entries .",
    "to set the stage we collect some rather elementary statements and estimates .",
