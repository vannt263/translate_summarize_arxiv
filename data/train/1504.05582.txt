    "stellar - mass black holes  ( bhs ) are now ubiquitously found in x - ray binaries .",
    "such bhs are formed in collapsing massive stars , but many questions remain about how the progenitor properties connect to those of the resulting bhs : which progenitors produce bhs not neutron stars ( ns )  @xcite ?",
    "what is the initial mass function of bhs  @xcite ?",
    "what is the initial spin distribution ?",
    "modern surveys can directly address these questions by catching bh formation in the local universe .",

    "one can expect @xmath5 collapse among this sample .",
    "some fraction of collapsing massive stars are expected to lead to bh formation with a failed supernova ( sn ) explosion ( in the sense of no traditional @xmath6 roughly spherical explosion ) .",
    "even such events may , however , be accompanied by an electromagnetic counterpart  @xcite . for example",
    ", the gravitational mass loss of @xmath7 via neutrinos in the proto - ns phase can drive a weak explosion of @xmath8 in the case of a red supergiant  ( rsg ) .",
    "this may result in a luminous red nova @xcite with shock breakout emission  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we first review the possible diversity of bh formation and its electromagnetic counterpart  ( sec . [",
    "sec : bhf_div ] ) .",
    "then , we focus on a relatively unexplored , but potentially promising observational target ; bh fallback disk outflow .",
    "we consider the limit in which the inner core of the progenitor is directly swallowed by the bh , but the outermost layers have sufficient angular momentum to form a disk   ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sche ] ) .",
    "the accretion rate is still super - eddington , and a strong outflow is expected to be launched from the disk  @xcite .",
    "if there is no significant quasi - spherical explosion initially , this outflow can be directly seen by distant observers .",
    "this situation can be realized in the collapse of e.g. , wolf - rayet stars  ( wrs ) and blue supergiants ( bsgs ) , and may in fact be rather common  @xcite .",
    "we analytically calculate the emission from fallback disk outflows , and show that they can be observed as blue uv - optical transients with a peak bolometric luminosity of @xmath0 and an emission duration of @xmath3 a few to @xmath3 10 days  ( sec . [ sec : lbn ] ) .",
    "such emissions may explain some of the rapid transients recently discovered by panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system  ( pan - starrs ) and palomar transient factory  ( ptf )  ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] ) .",
    "our scenario can be tested by detecting a radio afterglow within a few years after the optical peak .",
    "stellar - mass bhs are predominately formed in the core collapse of massive stars . for stars with zero - age - main - sequence  ( zams ) masses of @xmath9 , the iron core collapses",
    "once its mass exceeds the chandrasekhar limit , forming a proto - ns .",
    "the proto - ns cools via intense neutrino emission of @xmath10 , which is believed to ultimately power the sn explosion , at least in some progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if , however , the accretion shock onto the proto - ns stalls and never reverses to unbind the stellar envelope , the continued accretion eventually leads the proto - ns to collapse into a bh .",
    "we are interested in the latter case in this paper . even in this case , however , if the progenitor is a rsg , the change in core mass associated with neutrino radiation leads to a weak shock propagating out through the stellar envelope that unbinds @xmath3 a few @xmath11 of the envelope with a relatively small velocity of @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the weak shock also heats up the ejecta , leading to a slow red transient lasting for @xmath13 with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath14 .",
    "wr or bsg progenitors have steeper density gradients and more tightly bound envelopes than rsgs . as a result",
    ", it is likely that there is much less mass lost in quasi - spherical ejecta as a response to the neutrino radiation of the proto - ns binding energy ( though this remains to be demonstrated by detailed calculations ) .",
    "if there is bh formation associated with the failed explosion of wr or bsg progenitors , such events may thus have little electromagnetic signature in the absence of significant rotation . in the presence of significant angular momentum , however , the accretion disk that forms during collapse can power electromagnetic emission that would accompany bh formation in nominally failed explosions .",
    "wr or bsg progenitors with significant angular momentum are also the leading progenitors for long - duration ( and ultra - long duration ) gamma - ray bursts  ( grbs )  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these are observationally associated with robust , energetic explosions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is not guaranteed , however , that every , or even the majority of , wr or bsg progenitors with significant angular momentum produce successful grbs .",
    "for example , the powerful jets that produce grbs may require large - scale magnetic flux in the stellar progenitor as well as rapid rotation  @xcite .",
    "since large - scale magnetic flux tends to slow down the rotation of the core during stellar evolution , it could be that the combination of conditions required to produce luminous grbs is somewhat rare . in this paper",
    ", we argue that an alternative electromagnetic counterpart associated with bh formation during the collapse of rapidly rotating wr or bsg progenitors is a fast luminous uv - optical transient broadly similar to some events discovered by pan - starrs and ptf in the last @xmath15 years  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we consider the electromagnetic counterpart of collapse in which the bulk of the progenitor directly accretes onto the bh , and the outer most layers can form a fallback disk ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sche ] ) .",
    "we focus on the fallback disk outflow and the cooling emission in the course of its expansion , which can be seen directly by observers .",
    "this situation can be realized e.g. , for wrs in close binaries or bsgs with little mass loss during stellar evolution  @xcite .",
    "note that some rsgs may also lead tofailed \" explosions .",
    "however , in this case , spherical mass ejection of @xmath3 a few @xmath11 driven by the neutrino mass loss is more probable , and the disk outflows predicted here are likely hidden by this ejecta . any electromagnetic source associated with the fallback disk",
    "would be powered by the kinetic energy of the outflow thermalized via interaction with this ejecta  @xcite .",
    "once the sn shock stalls , the outer layers of the progenitor fall back to the central bh . if the outer layers have sufficient angular momentum , they form an equatorial torus at the circularization radius , @xmath16 we focus on marginal cases in which the circularization radius is not much larger than the innermost circular orbit of the bh ( @xmath17 ) ; we show below ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rab_fr ] ) that larger circularization radii likely lead to fainter more slowly evolving transients .",
    "the fallback rate can be estimated as @xmath18 , or @xmath19 where @xmath20 , or @xmath21 is the free fall timescale , @xmath22 is the radius of the outermost layer , and @xmath23 is the total mass of the disk . the torus is optically and geometrically thick , trapping the heat generated by the fallback material .",
    "the disk accretes once the angular momentum is effectively transported by e.g. , magnetorotational instability  ( mri ) .",
    "@xcite simulated accretion of low angular momentum gas in a scenario qualitatively analogous to that considered here .",
    "they showed that the mri redistributes angular momentum during the circularization , leading to dissipation which powers both accretion and an outflow . in our scenario ,",
    "the viscous time of the disk is much shorter than the fallback time scale .",
    "thus , the accretion rate is essentially given by the fallback rate ( eq . [ eq : m_acc ] ) , which is typically larger than the eddington accretion rate , @xmath24 .",
    "note that the opacity @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponds to electron scattering for singly ionized helium , fully ionized helium and hydrogen , respectively .",
    "the accretion rate is also below the accretion rate at which there is significant neutrino cooling  @xcite . in this case",
    ", one can expect a strong radiation - driven outflow from the disk .",
    "such outflows have been also confirmed by numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "we model the fallback disk outflow as follows .",
    "first , a fraction @xmath27 of the accreting mass is loaded on the outflow , @xmath28 or , @xmath29 second , the outflow velocity is approximately the escape velocity , @xmath30 , or @xmath31 finally , we assume that the outflow is isotropic , although in reality it will be moderately bipolar .    next , let us describe the density and temperature profile in the outflow , which are crucial for quantifying the electromagnetic emission .",
    "after the launch , the outflow expands into the surrounding medium . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the accretion rate is almost constant , and the outflow is approximately a steady wind . the density structure can be described as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , or @xmath35 is the density of the outflow at @xmath36 .",
    "since the outflow is initially highly optically thick , the temperature evolves adiabatically , @xmath37 , thus @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , or @xmath40 we note that the gas temperature in the disk is @xmath41 a few @xmath42 . in this case ,",
    "heavy nuclei up to at most o , ne , and mg can be synthesized inside the disk , but not fe group elements . hence , there is no radioactivity in the outflow .",
    "the above nuclear burning only occurs in the inner most disk , where the enthalpy is likely larger than the nuclear energy released , so that the nuclear reactions are not dynamically important  @xcite .    at @xmath43 ,",
    "the accretion rate decreases significantly , and the outflow essentially decouples from the disk .",
    "then , the outflow ejecta will expand in a homologous manner , @xmath44 .",
    "the density profile of the homologous ejecta can be described as @xmath45 we determine the normalization of the density by mass conservation , @xmath46 , which yields @xmath47 here , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . in this paper , we choose @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 so as to satisfy the energy conservation i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the internal energy of the shell is subdominant at @xmath56 due to adiabatic cooling . to obtain @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 consistently",
    ", one has to perform numerical simulations , but the basic characteristics of the optical emission are not so sensitive to these parameters .",
    "we take @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 as fiducial choices .",
    "as long as the ejecta is almost adiabatic , the temperature profile can be described as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , or @xmath65    we now estimate the electromagnetic emission from the outflow . as the outflow expands , the photons diffusively come out from the diffusion radius , @xmath66 , which is defined by the radius where the diffusion time of the photon is comparable to the expansion time of the outflow , i.e. , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 @xmath69 is the optical depth , and @xmath70 is the diffusion width .",
    "for each @xmath71 , one can calculate @xmath66 and @xmath72 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : emi1]-[eq;emi3 ] )  @xcite .. in this case , the thick diffusion phase in the homologous shell discussed in @xcite does not appear . ]",
    "the emission is approximately thermal with a temperature of @xmath73 at @xmath74 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the emission is thus given by @xmath75    the evolution of the emission as a function of time can be approximately described as follows .",
    "just after the outflow is launched , photons only come out from a thin outer layer of the expanding wind profile , and the diffusion radius effectively coincides with the outer edge ; @xmath76 in this case , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : emi1]-[eq;emi3 ] ) , the diffusion width is approximately given by @xmath77 note that @xmath78 in this phase .",
    "the temperature and bolometric luminosity evolve as @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "the homologous expansion sets in at @xmath81 , which is @xmath82 a day for our fiducial parameters ( eq . [ eq : t_acc ] ) .",
    "then , one has to consider photon diffusion in the density profile of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_homo ] ) . in our case ,",
    "the diffusion radius initially practically coincides with the outer edge at @xmath81 ; @xmath83 and the diffusion width can be described as @xmath84 now @xmath85 .",
    "accordingly , the observed temperature and bolometric luminosity evolve as @xmath86 @xmath87 the energy diffuses throughout the entire homologous shell when @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 the observed emission radius , temperature , and bolometric luminosity at @xmath90 can be estimated as @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath94 does not depend on @xmath22 , and on the other hand , @xmath95 does not depend on @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , @xmath96 depends only weakly on parameters  ( eq . [ eq : tph_tr ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is @xmath97 so that optical emission will peak soon after @xmath94 .",
    "( [ eq : lbol_tr ] ) can be written in an intuitive form , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the initial internal energy of the outflow and @xmath100^{4/3}$ ] is a factor of order unity determined by the profile of the homologous shell .",
    "the internal energy decreases with time @xmath101 for @xmath32 and @xmath102 for @xmath103 ; most of the energy is radiated over the timescale @xmath104 .    note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : lbol_tr_2 ] ) is different from the standard order of magnitude expression for the thermal energy radiated by a stellar explosion , which is @xmath105 where @xmath106 should now be interpreted as the radius of the pre - explosion star .",
    "the difference between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lbol_tr_2 ] ) and ( [ eq : lbol_tr_3 ] ) is that in the scenario explored here , the outflow is powered by a wind for @xmath32 and is only homologous for @xmath43 .",
    "this changes the magnitude of the adiabatic losses .",
    "at @xmath107 , the emission from the shell decreases quickly ; we assume @xmath108 , @xmath109 in the simple numerical models presented below ( figs . [",
