    "cold dark matter cosmology predicts that the halos of galaxies similar to the milky way form through the tidal disruption and accretion of numerous low - mass fragments  objects that may resemble the dwarf galaxies observed at the present time .",
    "the milky way offers us a unique laboratory to test this cosmological scenario by searching for the fossil records of these merging events , which may take the form of long stellar streams or large scale stellar substructure in the outer halo of our galaxy ( see bullock & johnston , this volume , p.  80 ) .",
    "the surroundings of globular clusters in the outer halo are one of the best places to look for the remnants of ancient dwarf satellites .",
    "the classical searle & zinn ( 1978 ) scenario of the formation of the milky way , in which the halo globular clusters formed in larger dwarf galaxies , can nowadays be considered the local manifestation of this hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "it is now well known that some galactic globular clusters are actually associated with the tidal stellar stream resulting from the accretion of dwarf satellites , thereby confirming that this process plays an important role in the building of the milky way globular cluster system .",
    "furthermore , several recent studies have suggested that the two most luminous galactic globular clusters ( m54 , associated with sagittarius , sarajedini & layden 1995 , and omega centauri , lee et al .",
    "1999 ) might be the nuclei of dwarf galaxies . extending previous suggestions , van den bergh ( 2000 )",
    "has argued that the `` young '' globulars located in the outer halo might be the nuclei of extinct dwarf galaxies and suggests that a search for evidence of this may prove worthwhile .",
    "if these clusters formed within larger stellar systems , we would expect to find them surrounded by a stellar population that should be revealed by deep photometry over a wide field . in this paper , we present the first ( most interesting ) preliminary results from a long term project designed to search for tidal debris around remote halo globular clusters , debris that may be the vestiges of the larger systems in which these clusters formed .",
    "our main technique for mapping tidal streams in the galactic halo is based on the analysis of specific regions of the color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) where the presence of the stellar population associated with the dwarf satellite is expected as a density enhancement above the foreground galactic population , assuming the distance moduli of the parent galaxy is the same that of the globular clusters .",
    "our previous experience in nearby systems ( see fig .",
    "1 ) indicates that the best way to detect these structures through resolved stars is by obtaining observations deep enough to reach the main sequence ( ms ) turn - off .",
    "this prominent feature is blue enough to avoid the contamination by milky way dwarf disk stars and is sometimes the only visible signature of the tidal debris of a dwarf galaxy in the cmd .",
    "figure 1 shows some examples of cmd morphologies of confirmed tidal debris around globular clusters ( see also martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2004 for some model cmds of tidal streams ) .",
    "all the data presented in this paper were obtained with the wide field camera at the 2.5  m isaac newton telescope at roque de los muchachos observatory ( la palma , spain ) .",
    "photometry was obtained with the daophot ii / allstar package .",
    "transformation of our photometry data to the standard system is still preliminary .",
    "our sample of selected globular clusters are members of the `` younger halo '' , which zinn ( 1993 ) proposed to be the accreted component after the collapse of the central regions of the galaxy",
    ". these dwarf remnants may be still undiscovered because of their very faint surface brightness ( @xmath0 31 mag / arcsec@xmath1 ) and scale size ( may be larger than @xmath24 kpc because of its possible tidally disrupted state ) and because these clusters have been observed only with small fields of view centered on the cluster .",
    "in addition , we also have included those globular clusters reported as possible members of known tidal streams in the galactic halo .",
    "it is now confirmed that sgr and its tidal stream contains at least five globular clusters .",
    "the first target of this project , pal 12 , was confirmed to be a bona - fide example of a supposedly isolated globular cluster belonging to a tidal stream of this external galaxy ( dinescu et al .",
    "2000 ; martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2002 , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "a list of additional sgr cluster candidates has been proposed by bellazzini et al .",
    "( this volume , p.  220 ) .",
    "more recently , frinchaboy et al .  (",
    "2004 ) have suggested that some nearby , low galactic latitude clusters are member of the monoceros tidal stream ( yanny et al .",
    "our main objective is to confirm whether these clusters were associated in the past with these two dwarfs , an important step towards understanding the role of these merger events in the building of the galactic globular cluster system .",
    "in addition , the cmd analysis of regions of these known tidal streams in the vicinity of these clusters also provides information on the distance , surface brightness , and stellar populations of their stellar debris ( see sects 4.1 and 4.2 ) , properties that may be compared with @xmath3-body simulations of the tidal disruption of each particular satellite ( martnez - delgado et al .  2004 ; pearrubia et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "our deep observations can reveal if some globular clusters have developed _ tidal tails _ of stars detached from the clusters by the tidal field of the galaxy ( see grillmair et al .",
    "1995 ; odenkirchen et al .",
    "consequently , this project also provides insights on the tidal disruption of the clusters even if they are not surrounded by a stellar population from a hypothetical host dwarf galaxy ( see sect .",
    "our deep photometry of tidal debris has already showed for first time evidence on the mass segregation in the tidal tail of a globular cluster ( pal 5 : koch et al .",
    "2004 ) or a possible clumpy distribution in the main body of pal 5 ( martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the cmd for 35@xmath4 35@xmath5 field centered on the vicinity of the globular cluster ngc 4147 ( _ left _ ) and for an extratidal field ( _ right _ ) , situated at 3 @xmath6 from its center ( and @xmath2 2@xmath6 from the globular cluster ngc 5024 ) .",
    "this outer field shows two possible ms turn - off features , which could be related with tidal debris of different systems or different wraps of a same stream .",
    "the ms feature with the turn - off at @xmath7 0.9 and @xmath8 and extending down to @xmath9 corresponds to the sgr northern tidal stream .",
    "the estimated heliocentric distance to this part of the stream from the ms turn - off magnitude is @xmath240 kpc .",
    "a possible second ms turn - off is observed at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , overlapping with the expected position of the cluster s ms population .",
    "this could be related to a very low surface brightness , additional wrap of the sgr tidal stream situated at a similar distance to that of the cluster ( @xmath12 20 kpc ; see below ) .",
    "another explanation is that this brighter turn - off is the signature of the tidal tail of some of the globular clusters in the vicinity ( ngc 4147 or ngc 5024 ) .",
    "however , our field does not seem to lie along the paths of either cluster s orbits estimated from their proper motions . finally , it could be also related to a new , very diffuse unknown tidal stream detected towards the north galactic pole ( see newberg et al .  2002 ; zinn et al .",
    ", this volume , p.  92 ) .",
    "kinematic information of these ms star candidates is necessary to decide on the identification of this possible tidal debris .",
    "another important question is whether ngc 4147 and/or ngc5024 could be formerly associated with the sgr dwarf galaxy .",
    "bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argued for the association of ngc 4147 with the sgr stream from its radial velocity and from the detection of m giant sgr stars around this cluster .",
    "however , our deep photometry shows that the heliocentric distance of the sgr northern stream in the field is @xmath220 kpc larger than the distance to ngc 4147 ( @xmath13 kpc ) or ngc  5024 ( @xmath14 kpc ) .",
    "models show that in this region of the sky one can expect to see two sgr streams ; one at @xmath240 kpc which is a leading stream that eventually turns around and falls toward the solar neighborhood , and the second , more diffuse , one at @xmath220 kpc which is an old trailing stream .",
    "some of this is indeed seen in the field between ngc 4147 and ngc 5024 where two turn - offs are apparent : the more prominent one at @xmath240 kpc and the less populated one at @xmath220 kpc .",
    "thus even if a sgr stream at @xmath220 kpc is present , it seems unlikely that such a diffuse stream can contain two globular clusters that once belonged to the same system , especially given the two very different values of the radial velocities of the clusters .",
    "alternatively , sgr debris in this part of the sky may be from the leading stream turning around and falling toward the solar neighborhood , and therefore the clusters may belong to two different streams from sgr .",
    "since the sgr stream configuration becomes very complex in this region it is hard to reach a definite conclusion regarding ngc 4147 and 5024 .",
    "we turn now to the proper motion information for these clusters . in table 1",
    "we show the intergrals of motion for sgr , for ngc 4147 and ngc 5024 , and for pal 12 , the cluster now widely accepted to have been part of sgr .",
    "orbits were integrated in the johnson , spergel , & hernquist ( 1995 ) potential , and proper motions were taken from the recent literature ( dinescu et al .  1999 , 2000 ;",
    "wang et al .",
    "because of their large differences in @xmath15 , the association of ngc  4147 with sgr is unlikely .",
    "the agreement between ngc  5024 and sgr is much better and is consistent with a dynamical association .",
    "our data also provide new insights into the stellar population of the sgr northern stream observed in this field .",
    "the stellar population of both clusters can be fitted very well with an old , metal - poor stellar theoretical isochrone ( [ fe / h ] @xmath16 ) .",
    "this same isochrone fits the population of the sgr northern stream at the larger distance ( @xmath17 kpc ) , suggesting that this part of the stream could be very metal - poor , as also reported by vivas , zinn , & gallart ( this volume , p.  108 ) for sgr rr lyrae stars .",
    "these results would indicate that the mean metallicity of the sgr tidal stream in its apocenter region is more metal poor than those observed in its center region , as predicted by some theoretical models ( see martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , metallicity estimates from pure ms fitting of the tidal debris are fairly ambiguous , and more data ( i.e. , spectroscopic metal abundances of sgr stream stars ) are necessary to confirm this possible scenario .",
    "[ [ a - possible - older - wrap - of - the - monoceros - tidal - stream - around - ngc7006 ] ] a possible older wrap of the monoceros tidal stream around ngc  7006 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    ngc 7006 ( @xmath18)an archetypical `` second parameter '' cluster  which resides in the outskips of the milky way , is of considerable interest for formation scenarios of the assembling of the galactic halo .",
    "the extratidal field of this cluster ( fig .",
    "2 ) shows an ms feature at @xmath19 and @xmath2023 that is not predicted by star count models of the galactic foreground population computed from the trilegal model of the milky way ( girard et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) for these galactic coordinates .",
    "although it could be associated with the stellar component of some unknown galactic perturbation , this population is more likely associated with a piece of a possible old , metal - poor stellar stream at a heliocentric distance of @xmath225 kpc",
    ". the smaller distance of this possible tidal debris than that of ngc 7006 ( @xmath21 kpc ) suggests that the feature is not associated with this globular cluster .",
    "the redder color of its ms turn - off also suggests that its stellar population could be more metal - rich than that of the cluster ( [ fe / h ] @xmath22 ) .",
    "the best candidate is the tri / and stream discovered in a large sky area at 1720 kpc ( majewski et al .",
    "2004 ) , which shows a similar ms turn - off feature in the cmds .",
    "our new detection at lower galactic longitude indicates that the distance to this tidal stream increases toward the galactic center , in good agreement with the predictions of theoretical models that shows this tidal debris as an older , more distant wrap of the monoceros tidal stream ( pearrubia et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "pal 13 is a low luminosity outer halo cluster in an advanced state of total tidal dissolution by the milky way ( siegel et al .",
    "the actual cluster size is controversial , so we derived its structural parameters using our deep wide field data as a first step to the search for tidal debris in its vicinity .",
    "figure 3 shows the density profile of the cluster obtained from our int data , in comparison with those obtained by ct et al .",
    "this profile shows a pronounced `` inflection '' , as predicted by @xmath3-body simulations of disrupting satellites or observed in the sgr main body ( majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) , providing strong observational evidence about its tidal destruction .",
    "our best - fit king  michie model ( dashed line in fig .",
    "3 ) yields a tidal radius of @xmath23 , confirming the suggestion that the cluster is considerably more extended than previously suspected ( ct et al .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the detection of at least one probable cluster member at @xmath215@xmath5 from the cluster center , found in a radial velocity survey conducted with the esi spectrograph on the 10  m keck telescope .",
    "the cmd of our control field ( situated at @xmath22.5@xmath6 ) shows a possible ms feature with position and slope coincident with those of the cluster ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "there are also two possible diffuse clumps of red stars at @xmath24 and ( 1.4 , 20 ) respectively that overlap with the expected position of the subgiant branch of pal 13 .",
    "these features could be related with the foreground halo population , although our comparison with different cmd models of the milky way population ( bensacon , trilegal ) prevent us from reaching a definitive conclusion .",
    "however , this cmd morphology resembles those observed in the tidal tails of the globular cluster pal 5 ( see fig .  1 ) , but with a significantly lower surface brightness , suggesting they could be related to the remmant of a substantially extended extratidal cluster population .",
    "the presence of such tidal extension would be consistent with the elongated shape of the isodensity contours of pal 13 in the direction close to the cluster s proper motion obtained from our data .",
    "unfortunately , the position of our control field is not aligned with the cluster s proper motion , where the maximum stellar density from the possible tidal tail emanating from the clusters would be expected . a new wider survey around pal 13 to confirm the presence of this possible relic of the cluster population is in progress .",
    "it has been confirmed that pal 14 is significantly younger than the average age of halo globular clusters ( sarajedini 1997 ) and is therefore one of the members of the zinn s `` younger halo '' clusters .",
    "its large galactocentric distance ( @xmath25 kpc ) suggests that the cluster has probably completed very few orbits around the galactic center .",
    "figure 2 ( _ right _ ) shows the cmd of the extratidal region ( assuming a tidal radius for pal 14 of @xmath26 ) for a total area of 0.26 deg@xmath1 around the cluster . it still shows a hook - like feature that is the vestige of the ms sequence of the cluster at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the total extension of this extratidal population is very uncertain because of the severe background galaxy contamination in this region of the cmd , but it could extend out to @xmath29 from the center of the cluster .",
    "these extratidal stars could be debris from the cluster or stars from a surrounding larger system , but more observations are needed to reach a definitive conclusion concerning its origin .",
