    "small bodies in the inner solar system are historically classified based on their appearance .",
    "comet refers to an object with extended appearance and sometimes one or several tails ; while asteroid refers to an object that is much smaller than the major planets and appears star - like .",
    "classification by orbital dynamics of these bodies shows that the dynamical characteristics of the two groups of objects differ as well : comets usually possess highly elliptical , parabolic or hyperbolic orbits , while asteroids usually possess more circular orbits .",
    "bodies which deviate from these trends ( i.e. comets in asteroidal orbits , or asteorids in cometary orbits ) are of significant interest , as their dynamical evolution and/or physical properties are apparently exceptional .",
    "although the first such outlier was officially recognized no later than 1989 ( e.g. the case of 95p/(2060 ) chiron , c.f .",
    "* ) , most outliers were not found until recently with the commissioning of a number of near - earth asteroid searching / follow - up programs . due to their distinct appearance , comet - like objects in asteroid - like orbits , or `` active asteroids '' @xcite , are more straightforward to recognize due to their significant morphological change during the transition to comet - like state , and so the recognition is usually robust .",
    "in contrast , their counterparts , asteroid - like objects in cometary orbits ( acos ) , due to their nature , are considerably more difficult to identify . from an orbital perspective , acos are most easily interpreted to be comets that have exhausted their volatiles ( or have their volatiles permanently buried by their crusts ) so that they appear asteroidal , i.e. they become `` dormant comets '' .",
    "however , dynamical studies have shown that a significant fraction of acos could be asteroids leaking out from the main - belt that are temporarily residing in comet - like orbits @xcite , therefore complicating the effort on disentangle orbital properties from physical properties of these bodies .",
    "one approach to identify dormant comets in the aco population is to look at comets at an intermediate state between active comets and dormant comets , sometimes labeled as comet - asteroid transition objects ( catos ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a handful of such objects have been suggested , such as 107p/(4015 ) wilson - harrington @xcite , 209p / linear @xcite and ( 3552 ) don quixote @xcite .",
    "however , these objects are usually faint and produce little dust , presenting a challenge for further investigation of their surface and dust properties .",
    "15p / finlay , a jupiter - family comet ( jfc ) , has been reportedly faint and tail - less since its discovery in 1886 @xcite .",
    "the comet has a small minimum orbit intersection distance ( moid ) of 0.0094  au to the earth s orbit , but has never been associated with any known meteor shower @xcite .",
    "coupled with the fact that 15p / finlay has shown a systematic decrease of maximum brightness at each perihelion passage in the past century it has been suggested that the comet is approaching a state of complete dormancy @xcite",
    ".    however , during its current perihelion passage , 15p / finlay exhibited two outbursts , each producing a parabolic `` shell '' around the original coma accompanied by a straight , freshly - formed `` tail '' in the anti - sunward direction .",
    "this resembles the historic outburst of 17p / holmes in 2007 @xcite albeit at a much smaller scale .",
    "however , it is notable that 17p / holmes s outbursts took place at a larger heliocentric distance ( 2.4  au ) than those of 15p / finlay ( @xmath11  au ) , therefore the underlying mechanism may not be necessarily the same although the similarity of their overall appearances is striking .",
    "the outbursts of 15p / finlay are significant in another context : as an earth - approaching comet , the outburst ejecta may find their way to the earth , creating a meteor outburst .",
    "previously , numerical simulation by mikhail maslov has suggested that the material released in 2014 will have a direct encounter with the earth in 2021 , which may produce a meteor outburst with zenith hourly rate ( zhr ) up to 50 .",
    "recent calculation by mikiya sato also arrived at similar results .",
    "an outburst from the parent comet may result in a stronger meteor event depending on the ejection velocity and planetary perturbation .",
    "potential meteor observations allow us to directly sample materials from a dormant comet candidate without a dedicated space mission , which may help in understanding the comet itself as well as the dormant comets as a population .",
    "in particular , meteor activity from acos can help establish prior periods of activity and constrain the dust production history of acos .",
    "in this work , we present an analysis of the observations of 15p / finlay taken during the two 2014/2015 outbursts .",
    "the goal is to understand the underlying nature of the outburst as well as the evolutionary status of the comet .",
    "we also examine the yet - to - be - discovered finlayid meteor shower and especially the potential 2021 meteor outburst .",
    "non - detection of the shower places constraints on past dust production history of 15p / finlay .",
    "the first outburst of 15p / finlay took place in the late hours of 2014 dec .",
    "15 , the timing being constrained by reports from christopher wyatt ( walcha , australia ; dec .",
    "15.43 ut ) and slooh.com chile observatory ( la dehesa , chile ; dec . 16.04 ut ) . during the outburst ,",
    "the comet brightened by about 3 magnitudes and developed a spiky tail .",
    "the tail diluted into the background with the brightness returning to its normal range by dec .",
    "2122 ( figure  [ fig : report]a , [ fig : morp1 ] ) .",
    "the second outburst took place around 2015 jan .",
    "16.0 ut as noted by alan hale ( cloudcroft , nm ) at jan . 16.07 who noted `` very bright , almost star - like central condensation '' that was absent in the earlier observations .",
    "the last negative observation comes from the solar wind anisotropies all - sky hydrogen ly-@xmath12 camera ( swan ) on - board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) @xcite around jan .",
    "15.5 ut . the outburst was subsequently noted independently by guo zheng - qiang ( shenyang , china ; jan .",
    "16.43 ut ) and michael mattiazzo ( swan hill , australia ; jan . 16.45 ut ) , as well as on the swan image taken near jan .",
    "16.5 ut ( next to the last non - detection image ) . the comet brightened by about 45 magnitudes during the second outburst , again with a freshly - formed tail .",
    "the brightness returned to the normal range around jan .",
    "20 ( figure  [ fig : report]b ) , but the tail lingered for a few more days until around jan .",
    "30 ( figure  [ fig : morp2 ] ) .      after receiving the reports of the outbursts , 15p / finlay was monitored using the facilities at f(/ph)otometric robotic atmospheric monitor ( fram ) located at pierre auger observatory ( argentina ) , xingming observatory ( china ) and vicksburg ( u.s . ) .",
    "the fram observations were conducted with a 0.3-m f/6.6 telescope equipped with a kodak kaf-1603me sensor , which gives a resolution of @xmath13 ; the xingming observations were conducted with a 0.35-m f/6.9 telescope with a kodak kaf-8300 sensor , images are binned by 2 , which gives a resolution of @xmath14 .",
    "the vicksburg observations were conducted with a 0.3-m f/10 telescope equipped with kodak kaf-1600 sensor which gives a resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "the observations at fram and vicksburg are intended for dust modeling , as such they were conducted with a cousins @xmath16 filter that blocks flux from major cometary gaseous emissions ( such as cn , c@xmath17 , c@xmath18 ) .",
    "the xingming observations were conducted with wider temporal coverage but without a filter , intended as a continuous monitor of the development of the outburst .",
    "details of the observations are summarized in table  [ tbl : obs - summary ] .",
    "the images are processed using standard procedure ( bias subtraction , dark subtraction , flat division ) , with plate constants solved using ucac  4 catalog @xcite .",
    "the images are then medianly combined following the motion of the comet .",
    "the composite images from fram and vicksburg are collapsed into a 1-dimensional profile .",
    "this is necessary as the considerable irregularities of the near - nucleus dust ( i.e. localized jets ) complicate the modeling work .",
    "the orbital plane angle at the two outbursts were also shallow enough ( @xmath19 ) to minimize the information loss during the image collapse .",
    "the 1-dimensional profile is simply derived from averaging a @xmath20 wide strip along the sun - comet axis , with the width of @xmath20 corresponding to the maximum width of the tail .",
    "the composite images from the monitoring observations at xingming ( figure  [ fig : morp1 ] and  [ fig : morp2 ] ) show that the morphologies and evolution of both outbursts are comparable : both outbursts produced a newly - formed dust shell that is slightly asymmetric with respect to the comet - sun axis ; the dust shell expands as time goes by and fades into the background within @xmath21 week .",
    "we perform aperture photometry with the xingming data .",
    "this is motivated by the considerable scatter shown on the magnitudes provided by the minor planet center ( mpc ) , possibly due to different instrumental and measurement settings adopted by different observers .",
    "data from fram and vicksburg is not used at this stage to avoid the complication due to instrumental differences .",
    "we use an aperture of @xmath22  km as projected at the distance of the comet centered at the nucleus .",
    "both 0.35-m and mpc magnitudes are reduced to `` normalized '' magnitudes at @xmath23  au using @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are normalized and observed nuclear magnitudes , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are heliocentric and geocentric distances in au , and @xmath29 is the canonical brightening rate exponent @xcite .",
    "the photometric calibration is performed using the v - band data from the aavso all - sky photometric survey ( apass ) catalog @xcite as the xingming system is most sensitive at v - band .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : report ] , the characteristic outburst decay time ( i.e. the time elapsed from the peak of the outburst to the point that the brightness reaches @xmath30 of the peak brightness ) is estimated to be at the order of 1  d.      to understand the dust produced by the outburst event , we model the observations using a monte carlo dust model developed in our earlier works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the dynamical evolution of the cometary dust is controlled by the ratio between radiation pressure and solar gravity , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the bulk density of the dust and @xmath33 the diameter of the dust , both in si units @xcite , as well as the initial ejection velocity of the dust .",
    "the latter is defined as    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the mean ejection speed of a dust particle of @xmath36 and @xmath37 follows a gaussian probability density function :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the standard deviation of @xmath37 , used to account for the physical spread @xmath37 due to the shape of the dusts . in this work",
    "we use @xmath40 following exploration by , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume the dust size follows a simple power - law with a differential size index of @xmath41 , and the that observed flux is solely contributed by scattered light from the dust particles .",
    "hence , the dust production rate is expressed as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the mean dust production rate of @xmath44 particles .",
    "simulated particles are symmetrically released from the nucleus . for both outbursts ,",
    "two possible outburst epochs are tested , each correspond to either the epochs of the last negative ( non - outburst ) report or the first positive report .",
    "for the first outburst , outburst epochs of 2014 dec .",

    "we only consider @xmath45 as ( 1 ) optical observations are most sensitive to @xmath51 ( micron - sized ) particles ; ( 2 ) larger particles stay closer to the nucleus ( as gravitational force dominates ) , models with @xmath52 are incompatible with the observations as they are not able to reproduce the obscured extended dust tails ; and ( 3 ) complications arise for the dynamics of @xmath53 ( submicron - sized ) particles as there are also subjected to lorentz forces .",
    "we use the mercury6 package @xcite to integrate particles from the start epoch ( i.e. the outburst epoch ) to the observation epoch , using the 15th order radau integrator @xcite . to accommodate the uncertainty in the exact epoch of the outburst , multiple outburst epochs , cued by the reports discussed in ",

    "15p / finlay s orbital elements are extracted from the jpl small body database elements k085/15 ( http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi ) as listed in table  [ tbl : mdl - orb ] .",
    "the resulting modeled image is convolved with a 2-dimensional gaussian function ( with fwhm equal to the fwhm of the actual images ) to mimic observational effects such as the instrumental point spread effect and atmospheric seeing .",
    "the modeled image is then collapsed into a 1-dimensional profile as what was done with the observations (   [ sec : obs - morphological ] ) .",
    "observed and modeled surface brightness profiles are normalized to 3  fwhms beyond the nucleus along the sun - comet axis .",
    "we mask out the region within 1  fwhm from the nucleus to avoid contamination of the signal from the nucleus .",
    "the region that is dominated by submicron - sized dust ( i.e. the tailward region that is too far from the nucleus for @xmath54 dust to reach ) is also masked , as we are focused on @xmath55 to mm - sized dust .",
    "to evaluate the degree of similarity between the observed and the modeled profiles , we calculate the normalized error variance ( nev ) as defined by    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the number of pixels , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the pixel brightness from the modeled and observed brightness profile respectively .",
    "we set the tolerance level of nev to 10% .",
    "the input parameters , test grids and best - fit results are tabulated in table  [ tbl : mdl - orb ] ,  [ tbl : mdl - parameter ] and figure  [ fig : mdl ] .",
    "it is encouraging that the best - fit models under the respective outburst epochs are largely consistent .",
    "we conclude that the characteristic ejection speed @xmath0  to  @xmath60 for the ejecta of the first outburst , while @xmath2  to  @xmath61 for the ejecta of the second outburst .",
    "the dust size index is at the range of @xmath62 .",
    "the ejection speed is comparable or is slightly larger than the one derived from the classic @xcite model ( which gives @xmath63 in our model ) , while the size index is comparable to the classic value , @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "it also appears that the characteristic ejection speed of the second outburst is higher than that of the first outburst , which seemingly support the idea that the second outburst was a more energetic event than the first one .",
    "the total mass of the dust emitted in the two outbursts are related to the effective scattering cross - section of the materials , @xmath65 , that can be calculated by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 , the phase angle corrected geometric albedo , is calculated using the compound henyey - greenstein model by @xcite , assuming @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , @xmath70 are the apparent magnitudes of the sun and the comet .",
    "this yields @xmath71 for the first outburst and @xmath72 for the second outburst , using the photometric measurements in figure  [ fig : report ] .",
    "the total mass of the ejecta can then be calculated via @xmath73 , where the mean dust size @xmath74 can be derived from the dust model discussed in ",
    "[ sec : kinematics ] .",
    "considering the variances among the best - fit models , we derive @xmath4  to  @xmath75 for the first outburst and @xmath6  to  @xmath76 for the second outburst ( depending on the exact timing of the individual outburst ) , corresponding to less than @xmath8 of the nucleus mass assuming a spherical nucleus .    with this mass , the specific energy of the two outbursts",
    "is calculated to be @xmath9  to  @xmath77 using the speed component derived from the dust model .",
    "this value is comparable to the value derived for 17p / holmes s 2007 outburst ( @xmath78 , c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the case of 17p / holmes , the large distance to the sun at the time of its outburst , as well as the closeness of the derived specific energy to the specific energy of the amorphous ice to crystalline , are compatible with the idea that the comet s mega - outburst was triggered by the nergy released by the crystallization of amorphous ice .",
    "however , 15p / finlay was much closer to the sun at its two outbursts than 17p / holmes at its 2007 outburst ( 1.0  au versus 2.5  au ) such that solar heat may be sufficient to drive the outburst to some degree , hence we consider it difficult to assess the role of crystallization for 15p / finlay s outburst at this stage .",
    "15p / finlay is puzzling in the sense that despite its occasional proximity to the earth s orbit , the hypothetical finlayid meteor shower has never been observed .",
    "this matter has been discussed in depth by @xcite , who concluded that the perturbation of jupiter has effectively dispersed the meteoroid stream , such that @xmath79 of the meteoroids released @xmath80  orbits ago would end up with distant _ nodal _ passages ( @xmath81  au ) from the earth s orbit .",
    "however , we think that this conclusion is unconvincing as the nodal plane approximation for earth impact may not be valid for 15p / finlay due to its shallow orbital plane ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "additionally , new astrometric observations of 15p / finlay in the last decade has reduced the uncertainty of the orbital elements by an order of magnitude ; hence the issue of the long term evolution of the finlayid meteoroid stream is worth revisiting .",
    "we first investigate the orbital stability of 15p / finlay .",
    "this is done by generating 100  clones of 15p / finlay using the orbital covariance matrix provided in jpl  k085/15 , and integrating all of them @xmath83  yr backwards .",
    "the integration is performed with mercury6 using the bulirsch - stoer integrator .",
    "the evolution of the perihelion distance of all clones is shown in figure  [ fig : comet - dyn ] .",
    "it can be seen that the perihelion distance of the clones are highly compact until 1613  a.d .",
    ", when a close encounter ( miss distance of the order of 0.1  au ) between 15p / finlay and jupiter occurred .",
    "this implies that any backward meteoroid stream simulation will be physically meaningful only as long as the starting date is after 1613  ad .",
    "next , we then simulate a total of 39,000 ( a randomly chosen number ) hypothetical particles released by 15p / finlay during its 1886 , 1909 and 1960 perihelion passage and examine their distribution in 2001 , to directly compare to @xcite s simulations .",
    "the simulation is performed using the same collection of subroutines described in   [ sec : kinematics ] except that the ejection model by @xcite is used and only @xmath84 ( millimeter - sized ) particles are simulated .",
    "the minimum orbit intersection distance vector @xmath85 between the earth and each meteoroid is calculated using the subroutine developed by @xcite to assess the likelihood of an earth encounter .",
    "the original moid is defined as a scalar ; here i define the direction of @xmath85 to be the same as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , @xmath88 are the heliocentric distance of the meteoroid and the earth at the moid point .",
    "we find as much as @xmath89 of the particles stay within 0.01  au from the earth s orbit as of 2001 , different from @xcite s finding .",
    "in addition , the dust trail is able to overlap with the earth s orbit ( figure  [ fig : met-2001 ] ) , further supporting the idea that a significant number of particles released by 15p / finlay 1020 orbits ago may still have direct encounters with the earth .",
    "the background meteoroid flux originating from 15p / finlay may be estimated in an order - of - magnitude manner .",
    "the absolute magnitude of 15p / finlay is @xmath90  times brighter than low - activity comet 209p / linear for which the meteoroid production capacity has been measured to be @xmath91 meteoroids per orbit @xcite .",
    "hence , in 10  orbits , 15p / finlay would generate @xmath92 meteoroids . assuming the meteoroids distribute uniformly along the orbit with an orbital period of 5  yr , as well as a delivery efficiency of @xmath93 to the region @xmath94  au from the earth s orbit and a characteristic duration of meteor activity of 1  week",
    ", the flux can be calculate by @xmath95 , which should be detectable by modern meteor survey systems .    to look for any undetected finlayid activity , we conduct a `` cued '' search in the canadian meteor orbit radar ( cmor ) database .",

    "since its commission in 2002 , cmor has measured 12 million meteoroid orbits , making it suitable for the search for weak meteor showers such as the finlayids .",
    "we first calculate the characteristics of the hypothetical finlayid radiant using the simulation results above , which yields @xmath96 , @xmath97 at sun - centered ecliptic coordinates , and a geocentric speed of @xmath98 .",
    "we then combine 14 years of cmor data into a stacked `` virtual '' year and look for any enhanced activity at the location of the theoretical radiant , using a wavelet - based search algorithm @xcite with probe sizes tuned to the expected radiant characteristics ( radiant probe size @xmath99 , velocity probe size @xmath100 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : met - cmor ] , no significant enhancement can be found at the expected period of activity ( solar longitude @xmath101 ) .",
    "@xcite has calculated that the detection limit for the wavelet algorithm applied on cmor is at the order of @xmath102 ; however , cmor sensitivity is also an order of magnitude less at a southerly radiant at @xmath103 comparing to northerly radiants , so the shower flux limit is probably closer to @xmath104 . hence , the existence and intensity ( or derived upper - limit ) of the finlayid meteor shower is not definitive , but favors southern hemisphere meteor surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , we also note that the range of the meteoroid sizes delivered to the earth s vicinity seems to be concentrated at the order of @xmath113 , which translates to a visual magnitude of @xmath114 @xcite considering the very low encounter speed .",

    "<S> the mass of the ejecta is calculated to be @xmath4 to @xmath5 for the first outburst and @xmath6 to @xmath7 for the second outburst , corresponds to less than @xmath8 of the nucleus mass . the specific energy of the two outbursts is found to be @xmath9 to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we also revisit the long - standing puzzle of the non - detection of the hypothetical finlayid meteor shower by performing a cued search using the 13-year data from the canadian meteor orbit radar , which does not reveal any positives . </S>",
