    "follow - up radial velocity ( rv ) observations of sun - like stars with planets have revealed a number of extrasolar multi - planet systems .",
    "many of them are involved in low - order mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) . in particular , at least four extrasolar systems are involved in a strong first order 2:1  mmr : gliese  876 @xcite , hd  82943 @xcite , hd  128311  @xcite , and hd  73526  @xcite .",
    "a considerable effort has been devoted to study the origin @xcite and dynamical stability of these intriguing systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet dynamical studies of the resonant configurations often rely on the 2-keplerian coplanar fits by the discovery teams .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the 2-keplerian models can be of a very limited use for systems involved in strong mutual interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even if a model incorporates mutual interactions , due to typically short time - span and a limited number of the observations , the orbital inclinations are barely constrained and usually only coplanar , edge - on configurations are considered . however , the recent results of @xcite and @xcite suggest that a significant fraction of planetary systems involving giant planets may be substantially non - coplanar .",
    "dynamical mechanisms which lead to fast amplification of the relative inclination are especially effective in the first order resonance configurations @xcite .",
    "also dynamical relaxation and collisional scattering of the protoplanets may favor large relative inclinations in such systems , even if they initially emerge in a flat protoplanetary disk .",
    "the interpretation of the rv data for multi - planet system may be difficult .",
    "the determination of the number of planets and their orbital periods can be problematic for some systems .",
    "in particular , for those involved in a 1:1  mmr .",
    "a periodogram of the rv signal for such a system @xcite is basically indistinguishable from that of a single planet in an eccentric orbit or , as we show in this paper , from a periodogram of a 2:1  mmr orbital configuration . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that a coplanar 1:1 mmr of jovian planets may be stable in a wide range of their orbital parameters .",
    "the results of hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite indicate that trojan planets in tadpole or horseshoe orbits might readily form and migrate within a proto - planetary disk .",
    "presumably , a 1:1 configuration may also emerge as a result of dynamical relaxation or migration frequently used to explain 2:1 mmr configurations . in the solar system there",
    "exist a number of moons involved in this type of resonance  famous janus - epimetheus system ( co - orbital moons of saturn , exchanging orbits ) , helene - polydeuces ( trojans of dione , a moon of saturn ) , telesto  calypso ( trojan moons of tethys , yet another moon of saturn ) .",
    "dynamically , these configurations mimic planetary systems in the 1:1  mmr .    in this paper",
    ", we perform an independent analysis of the rv data for and to verify if the observed rv variations can be explained not only by a configuration in a 2:1  mmr but also 1:1  mmr .",
    "the inevitable problem with modeling such systems is that due to a limited number of data and relatively large measurement errors , the best - fit orbital elements often and easily lead to catastrophically unstable configurations . in order to solve this problem",
    "one needs a method of fitting which incorporates a stability criterion .",
    "without such a constraint , one can find a stable best - fit orbits basically by chance .",
    "when we deal with a 1:1 mmr configuration , an appropriate stability control is essential as the planets share the same ( or a very similar ) orbit and a multi - parameter dynamical model is highly nonlinear . in this paper",
    "we use the term `` trojan planets '' not only for tadpole , close to coplanar and circular configurations but for all configurations characterized by a 1:1 mmr so having not only similar semi - major axes but also ( possibly ) large relative inclinations and variable eccentricities .",
    "due to strong mutual interactions , the planetary systems with giant planets have to avoid the unstable zones of the mmrs , a proximity of the collision zone and the zone of global instability where the overlapping of mmrs occurs .",
    "otherwise , the chaotic diffusion quickly leads the planets to collisions between each other or with the parent star .",
    "the overall picture of the phase space of a planetary system is predicted by the fundamental kolmogorov - arnold - moser theorem @xcite : the phase space is not continuous with respect to the stability criterion .",
    "hence , commonly used ( in particular , gradient - like ) algorithms of exploring the phase space are poorly designed for this task because they are `` blind '' to a sophisticated fractal - like structure of the phase space .",
    "the kam stability is described in terms of stable ( regular , quasi - periodic ) and unstable ( chaotic ) motions . at first",
    ", the use of such a formal criterion in the fitting process may be problematic .",
    "almost any planetary system , including our own , can be very close to a chaotic state .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that even if chaos appears , it should not impair the astronomical stability @xcite meaning that a system is bounded over a very long time and any collisions or ejections of planets do not occur .",
    "however , for configurations involving jupiter - like companions in close orbits with large eccentricities , the formal stability seems to be well related to the astronomical stability of the system , i.e. , chaotic motions mean a fast destabilization of a planetary configuration over short - time scale related to the most significant , low - order mmrs .",
    "it has been already demonstrated by dynamical analysis of systems residing in the regions of the phase space where the low - order mmrs are possible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we should note that there is not known any general relation between the lyapunov time ( a characteristic time - scale of the formal instability ) and the event time ( the time after which a physical change of a planetary system happens ; see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to put these ideas into action and to search for stable best - fit solutions in a self - consistent and optimal fashion , we treat the dynamical behavior ( in terms of chaotic and regular or mildly - chaotic states ) as an additional observable at the same level of importance as the rv measurements .",
    "this powerful approach has been already described in detail and successfully applied in @xcite .",
    "the kernel of our approach is the the genetic algorithm scheme ( ga ) implemented by @xcite in his publicly available code pikaia .",
    "the gas are ideal for our purpose because of their global non - gradient nature and their proven ability to efficiently explore a multidimensional noncontinuous parameter space .",
    "the rv data are modeled by a synthetic signal of the full @xmath2-body dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 function is modified by a stability penalty term employing an efficient fast indicator megno @xcite .",
    "the ga fits are finally refined by yet another very accurate non - gradient minimization scheme by nelder and mead @xcite widely known as the simplex method .",
    "this greatly reduces the cpu usage .",
    "we give the algorithm an acronym gamp ( genetic algorithm with megno penalty ) .",
    "the simplex method finds local minima of @xmath3 .",
    "the code may be also trapped in resonance islands surrounded by strongly chaotic motions even if @xmath3 inside such islands is larger than in the neighboring ( but unstable ) areas . by collecting solutions to which the gamp converged in many independent runs , we gather an ensemble of the local best - fit solutions .",
    "it helps us to illustrate the multidimensional properties of @xmath3 and to obtain realistic estimates of the parameter s errors by choosing the solutions within prescribed limits of the overall best - fit @xmath3 found in the entire search . at the end ,",
    "some of the selected best fits can be refined with longer integration times and much lower simplex tolerance than is used during the search phase .",
    "finally , the stability of the best - fit solutions is examined in planes of selected orbital osculating elements using the spectral number method ( @xmath4 ) by @xcite .",
    "it is an efficient fast indicator completely independent on megno .",
    "this enables us to verify and illustrate the best - fit solutions in a robust way and to examine dynamical properties of such configurations in wide ranges of neighboring initial conditions .",
    "note that the @xmath4 is related here to the short - term dynamics .",
    "thus the spectral signal analyzed is a time series @xmath5\\}$ ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively an osculating _ canonical _ semi - major axis and longitude of a planet .",
    "such an analysis makes it possible to resolve the proper mean motion @xmath8 as one of the fundamental frequencies of the system . note",
    "also that a stability criterion in the gamp code may be basically arbitrary .",
    "we use the formal kam criterion as the most general and well defined one .    [ [ section ] ]    the hd  128311 is an active k0 star @xcite . in the discovery paper , @xcite found an indication of a jovian planet and a linear trend in the rv data .",
    "they concluded that due to photospheric activity ( @xmath9 ) the stellar jitter is large @xmath10  m / s and the signal variability may be explained exclusively by the jitter . using an updated set of 76 rv measurements",
    ", @xcite found that the observations can be modeled by a system of two jupiter - like planets involved in a 2:1 mmr .",
    "the current estimate of the stellar jitter by these authors is @xmath11  m / s but still uncertain with a @xmath12 error .",
    "we rescale the measurement errors by adding this estimate in quadrature to the formal rv errors .",
    "the discovery team reports that the best - fit 2-keplerian model yielding @xmath13 and an rms @xmath14  m / s is catastrophically unstable .",
    "using our hybrid ga / simplex code @xcite driven by the keplerian model of the rv , we found a different , apparently better 2-planet solution which has @xmath15 and an rms @xmath16  m / s .",
    "the model parameters @xmath17 , i.e. , the semi - amplitude , orbital period , eccentricity , the argument of periastron and the time of periastron passage , for this fit are as follows : ( 51.948  m / s , 459.870  d , 0.362 , 59.401@xmath18 , 2474.867  d ) and ( 77.214",
    "m / s , 917.371  d , 0.248 , 5.541@xmath18 , 2310.806",
    "d ) for the inner and outer planet , respectively ; @xmath19 jd  2,450,000 and the velocity offset @xmath20  m / s .",
    "it is argued that the fit parameters of a multi - planet system should be interpreted in terms of osculating keplerian elements and minimal masses related to the jacobi coordinates @xcite . adopting the date of the first observation as the osculating epoch",
    ", we recalculated the inferred _ astrocentric _ osculating elements ( @xmath21 ) as follows ( 1.639  , 1.101  au , 0.362 , 59.37@xmath18 , 272.79@xmath18 ) and ( 3.194  , 1.746  au , 0.249 , 5.39@xmath18 , 199.62@xmath18 ) for the inner and outer planet , respectively .",
    "still , the derived configuration is also unstable and disrupts during about 200,000  yr .",
    "nevertheless , we found that its megno signature is characteristic for a system residing on the border of a stable region rather than a collisional configuration .",
    "thus one may suspect that in its proximity , a rigorously stable solutions can be easily found .    in order to deal with the problem of an unstable 2-kepler fit ,",
    "@xcite applied a method of fitting which incorporates the mutual interaction between planets @xcite and , additionally , explicitly involves stability criterion .",
    "as such the authors use the maximal eccentricity attained by the companions during an integration time .",
    "they report many stable solutions corresponding to the 2:1 mmr . according to the authors",
    ", their best fit yields an rms @xmath22  m / s and @xmath23 .",
    "we could not reproduce that value of @xmath3 .",
    "the quoted @xmath3 could be misprinted or a jitter estimate larger than @xmath11  m / s was used in the calculations .    for a comparison with that result and as a background for a further analysis",
    ", we performed the gamp search for the best - fit solution to the rv data from @xcite assuming that a 2:1 resonance is indeed present in the coplanar and edge - on system .",
    "we also explored a more general model in which the orbits are mutually inclined but we did not find substantially better fits .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , the elements of the best - fit solutions from the gamp runs are shown in a few representative planes of the osculating elements at the date of the first observation , jd , 2,450,983.827 . in the gamp code ,",
    "the megno was evaluated over @xmath24 orbital periods of the outer planet that is both efficient enough and makes it possible to withdraw strongly chaotic , unstable solutions .",
    "the best - fit initial conditions are marked with symbols of different sizes  larger circles indicate a smaller @xmath3 ( a better fit ) . only _",
    "stable _ solutions within the @xmath25 confidence interval of the best - fit solution ( given in table  1 ) are shown . in overall , the statistics of initial conditions shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] is in accord with the results of @xcite , see their fig .",
    "the permitted _ initial _ eccentricities of the fits span skewed and narrow valley in the @xmath26)-plane .",
    "let us note that we represent the @xmath2-body initial conditions in terms of astrocentric , osculating kepler elements at the epoch of the first observation .",
    "the orbital elements for the outer planet have larger errors than for the inner one .",
    "both semimajor - axes and phases are already very well determined .",
    "the parameters of the stable best - fit solution are given in table 1 ( fit i ) .",
    "note that this strictly regular solution has @xmath27 and rms @xmath28  m / s .",
    "a very similar value of @xmath3 in the @xmath2-body and keplerian fits means that the mutual interactions between planetary companions are not evident in the doppler signal spanning 10  yr .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that the stability constraints are essential for obtaining stable configuration of the @xmath2-body model .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we show the stability analysis the best fit solution corresponding to a 2:1 mmr ( fit  i given in table  1 ) . the spectral number , @xmath29 , as well as @xmath30 , the maximal eccentricities of both planets , and @xmath31 , the maximal @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 are the longitudes of pericenters ) , attained during the integration over @xmath34 orbital periods of the outer body are shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "it turns out that the best - fit solution lies on the border of an island related to the corotation of apsides ( @xmath35 as well as the critical arguments of the 2:1 mmr are librating about @xmath36 with a large amplitude ) .",
    "the border of the stable resonance zone which is present in the @xmath4-map can be also seen in all other maps , in particular in the @xmath37-maps .",
    "this is a strong argument that the formal stability criterion is in the one - to - one relationship with the behavior of the system .",
    "clearly , the search zone for the best - fit solution should be limited to the resonance island which constantly changes its shape when we change the orbital parameters .",
    "thanks to the instability penalty in our approach , we have confidence that the obtained solution is indeed optimal ( i.e. , it minimizes @xmath3 and is dynamically stable ) .    in our next test , we carried out a search for a stable trojan configuration .",
    "our model was extended to 14 osculating orbital elements including the inclinations and one nodal longitude as free parameters .",
    "note that due to very similar orbital semi - major axes , the planets are numbered by giving the symbol  `` b '' to that planet which has a smaller initial eccentricity . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , a well defined minimum of @xmath3 is present in the @xmath38 and @xmath39 planes .",
    "the best - fit inclinations are not very well constrained nevertheless their concentration is quite evident , in spite of a moderate time span of the observations .    the osculating elements of the best - fit solution are given in table  1 ( fit ii ) .",
    "its @xmath40 and rms @xmath41  m / s are very close to those of the 2:1 mmr configuration . the synthetic rv signals of both solutions are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] .",
    "they can be barely distinguished one from another .",
    "we also computed the lomb - scargle periodograms of both synthetic signals and we plotted them together with the periodogram of the data set in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "it shows that periodograms of the 2:1 and 1:1 configurations almost perfectly match each other .",
    "it would be very difficult to distinguish between the configurations by looking only at the periodograms .",
    "the best - fit trojan configuration resides in a wide stable zone in the plane of the eccentricities which extends up to 1 for both of these elements ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "the resonance area in the @xmath42-plane covers about 0.2  au .",
    "this width is even larger than for the 2:1 mmr configuration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) . obviously , the stable 1:1 mmr is possible due to the corotation of the apsides seen in the @xmath31-maps ( @xmath35 librates about @xmath43 ) .",
    "our choice of the stability criterion enables us to obtain very sharp borders of the resonance area .",
    "if this criterion was violated , the system would quickly disrupt ( because both @xmath44 go to 1 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] we show the stability maps for a solution which has an rms of about @xmath45  m / s ( slightly more than the best one ) and corresponds to much smaller masses ( both initial inclinations are about @xmath46 ) .",
    "essentially , all the dynamical features of the system do not change but the width of the resonance zone shrinks substantially .",
    "this is also an argument that an appropriate stability criterion has to be an integral part of the fitting tool .",
    "due to an extremely nonlinear nature of the system , even a small change of its initial elements may lead to a significant change in the shape of the resonance zone .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath47 becomes very `` flat '' in the regions of large @xmath44  so @xmath47 would not be a convenient stability indicator in a gamp - like code .",
    "another argument is that the variable rate of the chaotic diffusion which leads to the changes of the eccentricity can be sometimes to small to detect a collision or a qualitative change of the configuration over relatively short integrations which , for efficiency reasons , have to be limited to the time - scale of the mmrs .",
    "one might think that ( again , mainly for efficiency reasons ) @xmath31 would be a better choice than both @xmath47 and megno as a stability criterion .",
    "however , that test may also fail as in the resonance zone the critical angle @xmath35 may librate about different centers ( usually , about of @xmath36 or @xmath48 ) but it can circulate in some marginally unstable regions as well ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the planetary system @xcite has drawn attention of many researchers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 2-keplerian solutions produced by the discovery team correspond to catastrophically unstable configurations @xcite .",
    "the discovery team did not publish the observations of hd  82943 in source form .",
    "the method of dealing with the problem of unavailable rv data relies on digitizing the published figures depicting the measurements .",
    "this somewhat unusual approach has already become an accepted procedure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "first , we digitized 142 data points from the figures of @xcite .",
    "they slightly differ from the real observations .",
    "in particular , it is difficult to recover the exact moments of the observations @xcite but such digitized measurements still properly describe the overall shape of the observed rv curve and its characteristic features .",
    "we also graphically derived the measurement errors and rescaled them by adding in quadrature the stellar jitter which we estimated as @xmath49  m / s on the basis of @xcite .",
    "having such `` measurements '' , we recovered the best - fit 2-kepler solutions published by the discovery team @xcite .",
    "the only problem seems to be a little larger value of the rms of @xmath50  m / s ( compared to 6.8  m / s quoted in the original work ) . using the digitized rv measurements , @xcite showed that stable 2:1  mmr configurations are possible .",
    "their orbital parameters of coplanar , edge - on systems are similar to those we found with gamp ( fit iii in table  1 ) .",
    "we note that these authors looked for the best - fit solutions by minimizing the rms rather than @xmath3 , and they did not increased the internal errors by jitter .",
    "also the discovery team did not account for the jitter in their solutions .",
    "we extended the search for the best - fit solution assuming that a 1:1  mmr can be present in the system .",
    "as in the previous case , we did not find any stable and strictly coplanar , edge - on configuration of this type .",
    "however , using the generalized model in which masses , inclinations and one nodal longitude are free parameters , we found many stable solutions .",
    "their quality is not as good as for the 2:1  mmr  the best 1:1 mmr fit has @xmath51 and the rms is @xmath52  m / s which is about of 1  m / s worse than for our best 2:1 mmr solution .",
    "still , the 1:1 mmr solution may be plausible ( note that we use digitized `` observations '' ) .",
    "also , since the mass of the parent star can not be determined precisely @xcite , and when new measurements are available , the best - fit parameters and their @xmath3 may change . we demonstrate it in the next section .    the best - fit 1:1 mmr configuration ( fit iv in table  1 ) is characterized by initially large mutual orbital inclination because , although the inclinations for both planets are almost the same , the nodal longitude is about @xmath48 ( and the apsidal lines are anti - aligned ) .",
    "the orbital evolution leads to quite large variations of the orbital inclinations ( a few tens of degrees ) .",
    "the stability maps shown in figure  [ fig : fig8 ] reveal that , apparently , such a system would be locked in an extremely large zone of stable motions which extends up to @xmath53 .",
    "this means that the eccentricities could reach extremely large values but the system would be still stable .",
    "the width of the resonance with respect to @xmath54 is also relatively large , about @xmath55  au .",
    "a zone of strictly periodic motions can be seen in the map for @xmath31 , close to its diagonal .",
    "we extended the analysis of after gaining access to the same data set used by @xcite ( and also lee 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "these authors also used the `` digitized '' measurements from @xcite but added new observations obtained with the keck / hires .",
    "these new very accurate data fill in some gaps in the coralie measurements as well as significantly increase the time span of the observations . for consistency with @xcite",
    "we adopted the jitter estimate of @xmath56  m / s .",
    "the results of fitting 2-planet keplerian models and the analysis of their stability by @xcite strongly confirm the possibility of a stable 2:1 mmr in the system .",
    "still , new questions may be asked .",
    "the best fit of the 2:1 mmr configuration yields an rms @xmath57  m / s which is unexpectedly larger by 1  m / s from that quoted for the coralie data by the discovery team @xcite as well as by @xcite , and in this work .    for the updated data set , we recovered all the best fit keplerian solutions quoted by @xcite using our ga / simplex code .",
    "some of them appear to be formally chaotic or strongly unstable .",
    "thus we searched for a stable @xmath2-body solution using gamp assuming that the velocity offsets for the coralie and keck / hires data are independent .",
    "the found best - fit , _ rigorously stable _ solution corresponding to the 2:1 resonance of an edge - on system is given in table  2 ( fit  v ) .",
    "its quality is not very different from the best solutions found by @xcite but the initial eccentricities are significantly different .",
    "our fit  v is most similar to the 2-planet kepler fit  ii of @xcite .",
    "we also found other solutions which are similar to their fit  iii and iv with respect to small initial @xmath58 .    according to the results of @xcite and @xcite , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the less constrained parameters of the kepler fits to the rv data of hd  82943 .",
    "thus we computed dynamical maps for the relevant solutions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] and its caption ) as well as for fit  ii of @xcite .",
    "these maps reveal two narrow zones of stability in which the best - fit solutions reside .",
    "all acceptable ( stable ) 2:1  mmr fits likely belong to these two distinct islands .",
    "we label them with a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] .",
    "note that the positions and shape of the resonance areas are significantly altered when the fit parameters are adjusted . inside the resonance zone",
    "a , the amplitudes of the critical angles may vary in wide ranges .",
    "@xcite found that their fit ii has very small amplitudes of the critical angles of the 2:1  mmr , @xmath60 .",
    "our best @xmath2-body fit v yields much larger amplitudes , @xmath61 .",
    "the large amplitudes of the critical angles are also reported by @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fig9 ] , @xmath31 also librates about @xmath36 but with large amplitudes .",
    "we may speak about dynamical similarity of the best - fit solutions found so far , having in mind their position in the two resonance zones .",
    "the results of the dynamical analysis done by @xcite and in this paper favor the 2:1  mmr fits located in the island  a ( about @xmath64 ) .",
    "this zone is extended with respect to the not well constrained @xmath58 and very small amplitudes of the 2:1  mmr critical angles are possible .",
    "we also found many stable mutually inclined configurations using the orbital inclinations and one nodal argument as free parameters . still , all these fits have the rms @xmath57  m / s . by releasing the stability requirements in the gamp code ,",
    "one finds the best 2-planet fit yielding the rms @xmath65  m / s ( fit  vii in table  2 ) .",
    "however , this configuration disrupts in a few hundred years .",
    "curiously , such a solution involves a brown dwarf and a jovian planet on inclined orbits ( mutual inclination of @xmath66 ) .",
    "in fact , our main goal was to perform a possibly extensive search for 1:1 configurations .",
    "the statistics of stable solutions gathered in this search is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] , in a similar manner as for system .",
    "qualitatively , the solutions do not differ from the ones we found using the coralie data only .",

    "the best fit solution is given in table  2 ( fit  vi ) .",

    "[ fig : fig14 ] ) .",
    "also in this case the periodograms for the 2:1 and 1:1 mmr perfectly match each other .",
    "the solutions described so far do not explain the curious rms excess that is present in the extended data set .",

    "another possible explanation is that there is a new , unknown object in the system .",
    "that possibility is suggested by @xcite .",
    "looking at their fig .  4 which shows the residual signal to the 2-planet solutions , we can see a quasi - sinusoidal modulation with the period about of 1000  d. yet the jitter estimates of hd  82943 are uncertain by @xmath12 @xcite . thus by adopting values as high as 67  m / s ,",
    "one would obtain @xmath70 and the larger rms would be not necessarily unreasonable . still , the hypothesis about the third planet is a very attractive explanation of the rms excess .",
    "below we try to find out whether such a configuration would be consistent with a stable dynamics .",
    "first , we searched for 3-planet solutions using the hybrid kepler code and `` blindly '' assuming the same bounds of the orbital periods of [ 10,1200 ]  d and eccentricities of [ 0,0.8 ] for every planet .",
    "the use of multi - planet keplerian model enables us to quickly localize regions of orbital parameters in which potentially stable , @xmath2-body fits can be found .",
    "the code was restarted thousands of times . in this search",
    "the algorithm converged to a few distinct local minima yielding similar rms and @xmath3 .",
    "remarkably , two of the keplerian best fits , yielding @xmath71 and an rms @xmath72  m / s correspond to _ coplanar _ configurations involving two ( of three ) jovian planets in 1:1 mmr .",
    "the primary parameters ( @xmath73 ) of these fits are given in table  3 ( fit x and fit xi , respectively ) .",
    "their planets c and d would have similar periods but the eccentricities of the two outer planets in 1:1  mmr are significantly different .",
    "unfortunately , these fits are highly unstable .",
    "we did not succeed in `` stabilizing '' them by gamp ; nevertheless , the search was not very extensive and we suspect that stable solutions involving mutually inclined orbits may exist .",
    "the fit ix ( the mathematically best fit found in this paper ) yields @xmath74 and an rms @xmath75  m / s that indicates a almost `` perfect '' solution .",
    "it could be interpreted as a configuration of the outermost planet accompanying the confirmed giants involved in the 2:1 mmr .",
    "unfortunately , this solution is very unstable due to a large eccentricity of the outermost planet .",
    "we tried to refine it with gamp . in the relevant range of semi - major axes we found stable solutions , and",
    "the one we selected is given as fit  viii in table  2 .",
    "let us note that the stability criterion forces @xmath76 of this solution to a small value @xmath77 which also increases the rms to about 7.35  m / s .",
    "the dynamical maps shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig15 ] reveal narrow islands of stability in which the solution is found . the megno signature ( the left - upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig16 ] ) uncovers a weakly chaotic nature of this solution .",
    "nevertheless , there is no sign of a physical instability over at least 250  myr ( fig.[fig : fig16 ] is for the initial 5  myr integration period ) .",
    "a peculiarity of this fit is that @xmath76 remains small in spite of a close proximity to the two larger companions in eccentric orbits . for a comparison with the previously found 1:1  mmr and 2:1  mmr solutions , the synthetic curve of fit  viii",
    "is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ] .",
    "the described results might indicate that our knowledge of system is still limited in spite of much effort devoted to study the rv data of the parent star .",
    "the currently available measurements permit many qualitatively different orbital solutions well fitting the measurements .",
    "still , the use of stability criterion in the fit process seems to be essential to resolve the degeneracy between very good but strongly unstable keplerian and newtonian fits which , as we have shown above , can easily appear .",
    "we have demonstrated the rv measurements for and harboring 2-planet systems may be successfully modeled with two qualitatively different orbital configuration .",
    "one is already recognized configuration corresponding to a 2:1 mmr .",
    "we show that these observations are equally well modeled with trojan pairs of planets ( a 1:1 mmr ) .",
    "both these types of orbital configurations produce very similar periodograms of the rv signal .",
    "a common feature of the trojan solutions for both systems is the possibility for large eccentricities of the orbits , reaching @xmath78 .",
    "still , the best - fit trojan configurations reside in extended zones of rigorously stable quasi - periodic motions .",
    "the ease of maintaining stability and the large zones of regular motions may strengthen the hypothesis about the 1:1 mmr configurations .",
    "it is difficult to explain finding two systems in a 1:1  mmr in the sample of only @xmath10 multi - planet systems .",
    "a most promising mechanism that might produce such a configuration is the dynamical relaxation and planetary scattering @xcite . in particular ,",
    "an argument supporting such a hypothesis for the hd  82943 system is the evidence of a planet engulfment by the parent star @xcite .",
    "that event indicates planetary scaterring in the past",
    ". however , its effect on the currently observed configuration of the system would be hard to predict .",
    "to the best of our knowledge there are no works that could explicitly explain an inclined 1:1  mmr configuration as a result of a migration . on the other hand ,",
    "the origin of the 2:1  mmr is a well recognized problem as we know of at least four systems presumably involved in such a resonance .",
    "our work demonstrates that the 1:1  mmr configurations can be used to describe the observations of and .",
    "this hopefully will encourage others to study the origin of such systems .",
    "the best - fit trojan configurations were found using of our approach of modeling the rv data which incorporates a stability indicator .",
    "for this purpose we use a formal kam criterion which is closely related to a physical behavior of a planetary system . this criterion generalizes the @xmath47 and @xmath79 maps .",
    "still , these maps help us to determine the character of motions  e.g. a type of the corotation of the apsides .",
    "obviously , all the three indicators are strictly related .",
    "presumably , the stability maps would change if the model of motion included the relativistic and tidal interactions with the star . although these factors are orders of magnitude smaller than the leading gravitational interactions , their influence might change the overall stability picture of the systems .",
    "our work on this subject is ongoing .",
    "we appreciate discussions with prof .",
    "sylvio ferraz - mello and his help with obtaining the rv data of the hd  82943 system .",
    "we thank dr .",

    "we discuss the problem of a proper choice of the stability indicator in a gamp - like fitting code .",
    "we analyze two 1:1 initial conditions for the system which are marked in the stability maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , the upper row ; one is our best - fit 1:1 mmr configuration ) .",
    "let us recall that the calculations of @xmath4 were conducted over @xmath80 orbital periods of the planets ( about of @xmath81  yr ) .",
    "apparently , both initial conditions are localized in an extended resonance zone .",
    "figure [ fig : fig17 ] ( upper row ) illustrates the temporal megno , @xmath82 , as a function of time but computed over a much longer time - span , @xmath83 orbital periods . for the best - fit solution",
    ", the behavior of @xmath82 ( oscillations about 2 ) corresponds to a strictly quasi - periodic system while a slow divergence of this indicator can be observed for the modified initial condition ( marked with a diamond in the @xmath4 map , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "it indicates that in this case the system is in fact weakly chaotic ( the lyapunov exponent is relatively small , @xmath84 ) .",
    "an inspection of the @xmath31-map for this initial condition reveals that @xmath35 in this case circulates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig17 ] , right column ) but on the average the apsides are anti - aligned and this helps to maintain the stability .",
