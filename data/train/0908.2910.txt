    "the spin density matrix elements do not rely on normalization information ; thus , only the acceptance can contribute to the systematic uncertainty .",
    "possible effects due to systematic problems in the acceptance calculation were examined by analyzing decay distributions distorted by our estimated acceptance uncertainty . based on this study",

    "in this same region , the diagonal @xmath125 element decreases sharply as the energy increases , or equivalently , as the forward peak increases in significance .",
    "this is typical of exchange of a spin-0 particle in the @xmath3-channel where the @xmath2 is forced to carry the spin of the photon at forward angles .",

    "this dip is located near where the forward peak ( typically associated with @xmath3-channel contributions ) has decreased in significance such that it is approximately the same size as the cross section in the region @xmath137 .",
    "thus , it is possible that this dip results from interference between the @xmath3-channel and larger - angle production mechanisms . in the kinematic regions where the cross section possesses the humps and dips discussed in sec .",
