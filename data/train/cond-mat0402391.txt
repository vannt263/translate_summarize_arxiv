    "polarized light scattered many times in a random medium leaves the sample partially depolarized . unfortunately , despite its importance in areas like biomedical optical imaging , coherent backscattering or dynamic spectroscopy @xcite , the depolarization of light in a random medium is still not completely understood due to the complexity of vector wave multiple scattering ( as compared to the much simpler problem of scalar wave propagation ) .",
    "previous attempts have mainly focussed on isotropic ( rayleigh ) scattering @xcite , or on the depolarization of circularly polarized light @xcite .",
    "only few studies have discussed specifically the mechanism of depolarization of linearly polarized light in the case where the anisotropy parameter @xmath2 is different from @xmath3 and furthermore a detailed comparison with experiment has been lacking @xcite .",
    "an accurate description for arbitrary scattering anisotropy is however crucial to analyze the information contained in backscattered light if progress is to be made in applications like remote sensing , photon correlation spectroscopy or optical imaging of biological tissues @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we formulate a quantitative description of backscattered linearly polarized light using an extended photon diffusion formalism taking explicitly into account the scattering anisotropy parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the details of our model are adjusted by comparison with monte carlo simulations of multiply scattered light .",
    "we show how the characteristic length of depolarization of incident linearly polarized light @xmath1 can be deduced from measurements of intensity fluctuations of light scattered from liquid turbid media via diffusing wave spectroscopy ( dws ) .",
    "we can distinguish the following limiting situations for the transport of light and its polarization : isotropic scattering @xmath4 , forward - peaked scattering @xmath5 and backward - peaked scattering @xmath6 .",
    "the situation of forward - peaked scattering @xmath5 is typical of mie scattering @xcite with large particles and of biological tissues , whereas the situation of @xmath7 has only been made possible experimentally recently by tuning the interaction of the light using mesostructured colloidal liquids @xcite .",
    "here we show that with our additional correction the simple photon diffusion picture successfully describes the distribution of path lengths and the dws autocorrelation function in the backscattering geometry .",
    "on length scales much larger than the transport mean free path @xmath8 , the transport of light in a turbid medium can be described by the diffusion approximation .",
    "this approximation is connected to the idea of treating the transport of photons as a random walk , characterized by a distribution of path lengths @xcite .",
    "an exact solution of the diffusion equation applied to light transport can be obtained using the method of images .",
    "this method takes into account the boundary conditions through two lengths which are both of the order of a transport mean free path : the extrapolation length @xmath9 where the flux of the flux of photons vanishes outside the sample and @xmath10 which is the location of the photon source ( for a more detailed interpretation of @xmath11 based on a random walk model see reference ) .",
    "the method leads to @xmath12.\\ ] ] which obeys the normalization condition @xmath13 .",
    "note that the path length is simply related to the number of scattering events @xmath14 by @xmath15 , so that the path length is @xmath3 for single scattering . here",

    "these simulations use the mie scattering cross section in the range @xmath19 and are able to evaluate numerically an exact path length distribution as a function of the number of scattering events @xmath14 and polarization . the simulations were done for uncorrelated spherical scatterers ( structure function @xmath20 ) and for a non - reflecting interface characterized by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "[ fig1 ] we compare the results of the simulations with the prediction of the method of images according to eq .",
    "[ pathdl ] .",
    "we see clearly in this figure that the method of images provides an excellent description of the path length distribution for the case of isotropic scattering ( @xmath26 ) , but that the method fails to give an equally good description for the case of anisotropic scattering corresponding to @xmath27 .",
    "the disagreement in the latter case is not surprising as the diffusion approximation is known to overestimate the contribution from the short paths of the distribution , the error becoming more and more severe as the anisotropy of scattering increases .",
    "one way to improve the distribution of paths length of eq .",
    "[ pathdl ] , is by introducing a cutoff in the distribution as suggested by mackintosh and john @xcite .",

    "in transmission geometry the path length distribution can be measured experimentally using pulsed laser beams@xcite . in reflection however paths are short and therefore the time resolution is usually not sufficient for such measurements .",
