    "the recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies provided by the planck experiment have drastically improved our knowledge about the inflationary paradigm ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "several inflationary models have been ruled out and the overall picture presented by planck is perfectly consistent with purely adiabatic and gaussian primordial perturbations .    on the other hand",
    ", the recent planck data is also showing some interesting anomaly or tension that , albeit at small confidence level , is clearly worthwile of further investigation .",
    "for example , the planck data is well compatible with a larger value for the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at recombination than what is commonly expected in the standard scenario ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us remind here that the energy density of relativistic particles in cosmology at the epoch of recombination is given by : @xmath2 where @xmath0 is the effective number of neutrinos and @xmath3 is the cmb photon energy density .",
    "it is worthwile to point out that not only additional relativistic species would affect the value for @xmath0 but also other different neutrino properties , as a non - zero chemical potential , would change it from the standard value of @xmath4 ( see @xcite ) .    in practice ,",
    "the @xmath0 effective parameter covers a wide range of physical phenomena and it is therefore extremely important to check for its consistency with the standard expectation .",
    "interestingly enough , the recent planck data does show some indication for a non standard @xmath0 .",
    "for example , in the analysys of @xcite , a value of @xmath5 at @xmath6 c.l . from the planck",
    "cmb data alone is reported .",
    "more importantly , when the planck data is combined with the measurements of the hubble constant from @xcite the constraint becomes @xmath7 at @xmath6 c.l .",
    ", i.e. an indication for a non standard value at more than @xmath8 c.l ..    the main question that we want to address in this brief paper is if this anomaly can be connected with a non - standard inflationary process .    as pointed in previous papers ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) , a non zero chemical potential , and , therefore , a larger value for @xmath0 could arise in the curvaton scenario , proposed by @xcite .    in this model , while the exponential expansion is driven by the inflaton field , the primordial fluctuations are generated by a different field called `` curvaton '' . after the inflaton decay",
    ", the isocurvature perturbation produced initially by the curvaton is converted in an adiabatic component . in this model some residual isocurvature perturbation is therefore expected in the cosmological fluids ( cold dark matter , baryons and neutrinos ) ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in case of a non - vanishing neutrino chemical potential , neutrino density isocurvature perturbations are expected .    in few words ,",
    "probing neutrino isocurvature density perturbation ( nid hereafter ) , in the curvaton scenario is complementary to constrain the lepton number in the neutrino sector .",
    "it is therefore extremely timely to investigate the current cmb bounds on nid perturbation component , allowing at the same time a variation in the neutrino effective number @xmath0 .",
    "bounds on neutrino isocurvature perturbations have been presented in the past in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the planck collaboration has also provided new and stringent bounds on nid , but fixing @xmath0 to the standard value of @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    "we present , for the first time , a combined analysis for @xmath0 and nid from the planck data , considering also the possibility of other datasets as the recent hubble constant measurements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ nu ]",
    "we review the nid perturbations which are generated in the curvaton scenario , in section [ analysis ] we describe our analysis method , while in section [ results ] we present the corresponding results .",
    "our conclusions are reported in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "let us remind the description of density perturbations in terms of the gauge invariant variable @xmath10 that describes the curvature perturbation on slices of uniform total density @xcite :    @xmath11    where the dot denotes derivatives with respect to the cosmological time @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the hubble parameter , @xmath14 is the ( gauge - dependent ) curvature perturbation , and @xmath15 the total energy density .    in the case of multiple fluids , it is possible to define the quantities @xmath16 for each of the @xmath17-th energy component    @xmath18    for an adiabatic mode the ratios @xmath19 are all the same , so that @xmath20 for all components . at the same time ,",
    "an isocurvature fluctuation @xmath21 in the @xmath17-th energy component is given by the relative entropy fluctuation with respect to photons : @xmath22    the relativistic neutrinos will follow an equilibrium distribution function as    @xmath23^{-1 } \\",
    ", \\label{eq : fd}\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is their temperature , @xmath25 with @xmath26 as the chemical potential , the index @xmath17 runs over the three neutrino families , @xmath27 , and the minus ( plus ) sign is for neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) .",
    "it is important to note that nid perturbations necessarily implies a non zero lepton asymmetry for the neutrino , @xmath28 , unless there is an exact cancellation of the asymmetries in the three flavours .    given the distribution function eq .",
    "( [ eq : fd ] ) , the energy density @xmath29 in the high - temperature limit @xmath30 is given by @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 \\ ; , \\label{eq : ai}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from our above definition , we have that @xmath33 .",
    "we can thus relate the isocurvature perturbation in the total neutrino density to the fluctuations @xmath34 ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath35    in summary , a nid component is naturally connected to a non - standard value for @xmath0 . in the next section",
    "we will therefore perform an analysis allowing both components to vary .",
    "our analysis method is based on the boltzmann camb code  @xcite and a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) analysis based on the mcmc package ` cosmomc `  @xcite .",
    "we sample the following set of parameters :    @xmath36 , n_{eff } , \\alpha^{nid}\\}~,\\ ] ]    @xmath37 and @xmath38 being the physical baryon and cold dark matter energy densities , @xmath39 the ratio between the sound horizon and the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath40 is the reionization optical depth , @xmath41 the scalar spectral index , @xmath42 the amplitude of the primordial spectrum , @xmath0 the effective neutrino number and @xmath1 is the nid amplitude defined such that the total cmb power spectrum is given by :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the adiabatic component , @xmath45 is the neutrino isocurvature density component and @xmath46 is the correlated spectrum . with this convention , when @xmath47 the spectra are totally anti - correlated .",
    "these theoretical power spectra are then compared with the recent cmb measurements made by the planck experiment . for the planck data",
    ", we add the high-@xmath48 and low-@xmath48 tt likelihoods and we also add the low-@xmath48 te , ee , bb wmap likelihood , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "this corresponds exactly to the planck+wp case presented in ref .",
    "moreover , we have marginalized over all foregrounds parameters , using the same procedure and priors presented in ref .",
    "we also consider the hst constraint on the hubble constant from @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         since , as discussed in the previous section , a positive or a negative value for @xmath1 discriminates between very different physical mechanisms for this nid component , it is interesting to repeat the analysis but imposing each time the @xmath49 or @xmath50 prior . the results for this analysis are reported in table 2 , for the two datasets : planck+wp and planck+wp+hst .",
    "as we can see , the interesting aspect is that when a @xmath50 prior is imposed , the planck+wp case provide a value for the hubble constant that is in tension with current hst determinations , even if the @xmath0 parameter is allowed to vary .",
    "it is clear from this that a nid component with @xmath50 ca nt resolve the current tension on the values of @xmath51 between the planck data and the hst constraint . on the other hand ,",
    "the hst prior is clearly against a @xmath50 component , since including it drastically improves the constraint on this parameter .    in the case of @xmath49 , on the contrary , the constraint on the nid component are practically left unaffected by the inclusion of a hst prior .",
    "this is evident from figure 2 , where we report the 2-d constraints on the @xmath51 vs @xmath1 in the case of @xmath50 ( top panel ) and @xmath49 ( bottom panel ) for the planck+wp and planck+wp+hst datasets .",
    "the recent cosmic microwave background data from the planck satellite experiment , when combined with hst determinations of the hubble constant , are compatible with a larger , non - standard , number of relativistic degrees of freedom at recombination , parametrized by the neutrino effective number @xmath0 . in the curvaton scenario ,",
    "a larger value for @xmath0 could arise from a non - zero neutrino chemical potential connected to residual isocurvature perturbations after the decay of the curvaton field , which component is parametrized by the amplitude @xmath1 . here",
    "we present constraints on a joint analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we found that the planck+wp dataset does not show any indication for a neutrino isocurvature component and that current indications for a non standard @xmath0 component are further relaxed .",
    "when the hst prior on the hubble constant is included , an anticorrelated , @xmath50 , neutrino isocurvature density component is severly constrained , while the combined analysis suggests a value for @xmath0 larger than the standard expectations at more than two standard deviations .",
