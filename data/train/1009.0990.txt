    "having been discovered more than a century ago @xcite , whistler waves become one of the most important waves in plasmas . such waves ( also known as helicons in solid state plasmas ) are low - frequency ( lf ) ( in comparison with the electron - cyclotron frequency , @xmath0 )  right - hand circularly polarized ( rcp ) electromagnetic ( em ) waves guided almost along the external magnetic field in dense plasmas .",
    "because of the increase of their group velocity with the frequency , @xmath1 ( see , e.g. ref .",

    "when the whistler frequency is smaller than @xmath266 and the group dispersion is positive at higher densities , one can excite a nondiverging whistler wave , i.e. , a ducted whistler .",
    "the latter corresponds to a field aligned density hump with @xmath267 furthermore , the whistler solitons with density dips and humps can occur depending on the consideration of the frequency regime as well as the magnetic field strength and/ or the particle density .",
    "we ought to mention that our present investigation on the nonlinear propagation of em whistlers might play an important role in studies of beat - wave particle accelerators @xcite as well as in the problem of radio - frequency electron - cyclotron - resonance heating @xcite of plasmas where the driver , instead of being a laser , is a whistler wave .",

    "<S> the nonlinear propagation of electromagnetic ( em ) electron - cyclotron waves ( whistlers ) along an external magnetic field , and their modulation by electrostatic small but finite amplitude ion - acoustic density perturbations are investigated in a uniform quantum plasma with intrinsic spin of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the quantum force associated with the bohm potential and the combined effects of the classical as well as the spin - induced ponderomotive forces ( cpf and spf respectively ) are taken into consideration . </S>",
    "<S> the latter modify the local plasma density in a self - consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> the coupled modes of wave propagation is shown to be governed by a modified set of nonlinear schrdinger - boussinesq - like equations which admit exact solutions in form of stationary localized envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulation reveals the existence of large - scale density fluctuations that are self - consistently created by the localized whistlers in a strongly magnetized high density plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions for the modulational instability ( mi ) and the value of its growth rate are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> possible applications of our results , e.g. , in strongly magnetized dense plasmas and in the next generation laser - solid density plasma interaction experiments are discussed . </S>"
