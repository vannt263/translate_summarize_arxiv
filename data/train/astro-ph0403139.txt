    "the w3 giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) complex is located in the perseus spiral arm at a distance of 1.83@xmath50.14 kpc from the sun ( imai et al .",
    "w3 gmc hosts two massive and active star forming regions , w3 main in the north , and w3 ( oh ) in the south .",
    "the w3 main star forming region contains objects such as h ii regions , embedded infrared sources ( including the extremely luminous cluster of sources w3 irs 5 ) , oh and water masers ( wynn - williams et al .",
    "1974 , forster et al . 1977 , gaume & mutel 1987 ) , which are in different stages of evolution .",
    "the millimeter continuum observations have shown the existence of two dense clumps of about 2000 m@xmath6 associated with the luminous infrared sources irs 4 and irs 5 in the w3 core ( richardson et al .",
    "vla observations have resolved the irs 5 region into a cluster of seven distinct centimeter radio sources ( tieftrunk et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter tgc97 ; claussen et al .",
    "1994 , hereafter cg94 ) .",
    "tgc97 proposed that the spatial and kinematic relation of the compact , ultracompact , and hypercompact radio continuum regions toward w3 main is indicative of sequentially triggered star formation caused by the pressure of the expanding h ii regions and the subsequent compression of the molecular gas .",
    "recently , high resolution continuum imaging at 1.3 and 0.7 cm of four hypercompact h ii regions in w3 irs 5 , suggested that these sources contain b or o stars ( wilson et al .",
    "2003 ) .",

    "( 1996 ) found a dense concentration of stars in the molecular clump surrounding w3 irs 5 .",
    "these data showed a large , embedded population of intermediate to low mass stars co - existing with recently formed ob stars .",
    "they also argued that the formation of high mass stars is associated with the formation of dense clusters of low mass stars in the w3 main star forming region .",
    "several x - ray sources were detected in the w3 core by chandra x - ray observatory ( hofner et al .",
    "most of these sources are located at the peak radio positions of the w3 h ii regions .",
    "hofner et al . (",
    "2002 ) postulated that the x - ray sources are the young massive stars that are also responsible for the ionization of the compact and ultracompact h ii regions in the w3 core .",
    "in this paper we present deep j , h , and k@xmath0-bands nir observations of the w3 main star forming region . in comparison with the previous nir survey ( megeath et al .",
    "1996 ) , our survey covers a larger area ( @xmath1 24 arcmin@xmath2 ) surrounding w3 irs 5 , including compact h ii regions w3 a , w3 b and w3 d , diffuse h ii regions w3 h , w3 j and w3 k , and the cometary ultracompact ( uc ) h ii regions w3 c , w3 e and w3 f. these individual h ii regions have been labeled following the scheme introduced by wynn - williams ( 1971 ) and harris & wynn - williams ( 1976 ) .",
    "our motivation is to look for new young stellar objects ( ysos ) associated with the w3 main region , to determine their evolutionary stages , and to discuss their nature .",

    "( 1998 ) have presented the three 10@xmath710  mosaics ( @xmath1 300 arcmin@xmath2 ) in k filter of w3 region .",
    "this mosaic has similar spatial resolution and depth to the sirius k@xmath0 image and covers the region stretching from w3 main to w3(oh ) .",
    "however , due to the crowded nature of the sources and the large pixel size , the k-band mosaic was not suitable for photometry of the embedded stellar clusters . in sects . 2 and 3 we present the details of observations and data reduction procedures , sect .",

    "the field of view in each band is @xmath1 4.9 @xmath7 4.9 , with a pixel scale of 0.28 at the cassegrain focus of @xmath10 .",
    "the hgcdte arrays work linearly within 3% upto 15,000 adu and saturate at @xmath1 25,000 adu ( nagayama et al .",
    "2003 ) . at our k@xmath0 = 12 mag , the adu counts are well below 15,000 , thus we consider the source magnitudes to be correct within 3% .",

    "total on - target integration time in each of the bands was 14 minutes .",
    "all the observations were done under good photometric sky conditions .",
    "we found an rms magnitude fluctuation of less than 0.05 mag in k@xmath0-band during @xmath1 1 hour of the observations .",
    "the average seeing in the k@xmath0-band was 1.2 during the observations .",
    "the observations were made at air masses between 1.5 and 1.8 .",
    "dark and dome flats were obtained at the beginning and end of the observations .",
    "the photometric calibration was obtained by observing the standard star 9183 in the faint nir standard star catalog of persson et al .",

    "data reduction was done using the pipeline software based on noao s iraf package tasks .",
    "dome flat - fielding and sky subtraction with a median sky frame were applied .",
    "identification and photometry of point sources were performed by using the daofind and daophot packages in iraf , respectively .",
    "because of source confusion and nebulosity within the region , photometry was obtained using the point - spread function ( psf ) algorithm allstar in the daophot package ( stetson 1987 ) . for the jhk@xmath0-band images the adopted fitting radii were 5 pixels ( @xmath1 1 fwhm of the psf ) , and the psf radius was 21 pixels .",
    "the local sky was evaluated in an annulus with an inner radius of 20 pixels and a width of 35 pixels .",

    "the resulting photometric data are in the sirius system . for the purposes of plotting these data in color - color and color - magnitude diagrams ,",
    "we have converted them into the california institute of technology ( cit ) system using the color transformations between the sirius and cit systems ( nagashima et al .",
    "2003 ) , which have been obtained by observing several of the red standard stars of persson et al .",
    "absolute position calibration was achieved using the coordinates of a number of stars from the 2mass catalogue .",
    "the position accuracy is better than @xmath50.7 rms in the w3 main field , as compared to that of the reference field ( @xmath50.2 ) .",
    "the relatively poorer positional accuracy in w3 main is probably due to a spatially varying nebulosity in the field .",
    "the completeness limits of the images were evaluated by adding artificial stars of different magnitudes to the images and determining the fraction of stars recovered in each magnitude bin .",
    "the recovery rate was greater than 90% for magnitudes brighter than 17 , 16 , and 15 in the j , h , and k@xmath0-bands respectively .",
    "the observations are complete ( 100% ) to the level of 15 , 15 and 14 magnitudes in j , h and k@xmath0-bands respectively . the limiting magnitudes ( at 10 @xmath3 )",
    "are roughly estimated to be @xmath1 19.0 , 18.1 , and 17.3 at j , h , and k@xmath0-bands , respectively .",
    "we found that within the 10 @xmath3 completeness limit , the accuracy on magnitudes of @xmath1 98% stars in our sample is better than 0.1 mag .",
    "the sources are saturated at k@xmath0 @xmath18 12 . for such bright sources ,",
    "2mass psc data were used .",
    "we estimated the errors in photometry due to source confusion and nebulosity through artificial star experiments .",
    "the difference between the magnitudes of the added and recovered stars should reflect the effect of confusion with other stars and nebulosity .",
    "we find that for j = 19.0 , h = 18.1 , and k@xmath0 = 17.3 stars ( at our 10 @xmath3 mag detection limit ) , the rms error of the difference is 0.22 , 0.22 , and 0.23 mag , respectively .",

    "the error increases rapidly with increasing magnitude ( see fig .",
    "the j , h , and k@xmath0-band images of the w3 main star forming region are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the circle of a radius of 30  ( 0.27 pc ) marked in the h - band image represents the cluster region around w3 irs 5 source which has been detected only in the k@xmath0-band ( see sect .",

    "the image shows bright nebulosities towards the compact h ii regions w3 a , w3 b , and w3 d. we also detect a faint nebulosity around the uc h ii regions w3 c , w3 e , w3 f , and w3 g. w3 h , w3 j , and w3 k are more diffuse and dispersed h ii regions .",
    "the bright blue massive stars of spectral types o and b ( tgc97 ) are the ionizing sources of the compact and diffuse h ii regions .",
    "dark filaments extending from north - west to south - east can be seen between the diffuse nebulosity found throughout the whole image .",

    "we see a dense cluster of embedded stars surrounding irs 5 . a large number of red young stars are also seen around , which are presumably embedded in the molecular core ( see sect .",
    "4.3 ) .",
    "we obtained photometric data of 986 sources in j , 1236 in h , and 1512 in k@xmath0-band .",
    "the drastic drop in the number of sources detected at the shorter wavelengths in spite of greater sensitivity gives the first indication of the extremely high interstellar extinction around the w3 main region .",

    "4 ) represent the main sequence curve reddened by a@xmath26 = 0 , 20 , 40 and 60 magnitudes , respectively . we have assumed a distance of 1.83 kpc to the sources to reproduce the main sequence data on this plot .",

    "4 trace the reddening zones for each spectral type .",
    "ysos ( class ii and i ) found from the cc diagram ( fig .",
    "3a ) are shown as stars and filled triangles . however , it is important to note that even those stars not shown with stars or filled triangles may also be ysos with an intrinsic color excess , since those stars are detected in the h and k@xmath0-bands only and are not in the j band due to their very red colors .",
    "two bright and very red objects ( k @xmath18 11.5 , h - k @xmath4 2.8 ) located in the upper right corner of the figure are probably the very young stars in their earliest evolutionary phases ( see appendix and fig .",

    "3a ) are distributed all over the field , however there is an apparent concentration of these sources around w3 a , w3 b , w3 f , w3 h , and w3 j h ii regions as seen in fig .",
    "what is particularly striking is that most of these ysos are associated with the diffuse ionized gas at the edge of the compact h ii regions .",
    "stars with large color indices ( h - k @xmath4 2 ) are seen near the dense parts of the molecular cloud .",
    "most of them are clustered near the massive molecular clumps surrounding the luminous infrared sources w3 irs 4 and w3 irs 5 .",
    "some of them are expected to be members of the embedded stellar cluster around w3 irs 5 .",
    "it is to be noted that these red sources are not associated with any h ii regions ( except the two sources south of w3 a ) .",
    "therefore , these sources associated with the molecular clumps are embedded pms stars , presumably .    the average extinction through the molecular cloud around irs 5 that hosts the embedded cluster is a@xmath26 @xmath1 15 mag .",
    "if we assume that the large h - k ( @xmath4 2 ) color results merely from interstellar reddening affecting normal stars , then the extinction value might even exceed 40 mag in the molecular cloud where most of the red stars are found .",
    "however , with such a large amount of absorption , diffuse emissions are unlikely to be detected in the nir .",
    "since most of the red sources are associated with faint diffuse emission , this provides an evidence that these sources are ysos with intrinsic nir excess and possibly local extinction also . in fig .",
    "4 , a large fraction ( @xmath1 94% ) of these sources are located above the straight line drawn from an a0 star parallel to the extinction vector .",
    "this suggests that they are high mass stars with circumstellar materials .",
    "we use the k@xmath0-band luminosity function ( klf ) to constrain the initial mass function ( imf ) and age of the embedded stellar population in w3 main . to derive the klf ,",
    "we have determined the completeness of the data through artificial star experiments using _ addstar _ in iraf .",
    "this was performed by adding fake stars in random positions into the images at 0.5 magnitude intervals and then checking how many of the added stars could be recovered at various magnitude intervals .",
    "we repeated this procedure at least 8 times .",
    "we thus obtained the detection rate as a function of magnitude , which is defined as the ratio of the number of recovered artificial stars over the number of added stars .",
    "6 shows the rms error in the magnitude ( difference between the magnitudes of the added and recovered stars ) of the recovered fake stars as a function of the recovered magnitude . at k@xmath0 = 17.3 ( 10 @xmath3 detection limit ) , the rms error is 0.23 mag ( see sect .",
    "3 ) . the error is larger for the cluster than for the whole region due to source confusion and nebulosity in the cluster region . in fig .",
    "7 , we present the raw klfs for the cluster of a radius of 30  ( 0.27 pc ) around w3 irs 5 ( see fig . 1 ) and the whole w3 main region along with the photometric completeness determined as above .",
    "we find that the completeness ratio drops below 90% at 14th magnitude and is lower for the cluster than for the whole region . in order to estimate the foreground and background contaminations , we made use of both the galactic model by wainscoat et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and the reference field star count .",
    "the star counts were predicted in the direction of the reference field close to the w3 main ( see sect .",
    "2 ) , which is also corrected for the photometric completeness . from fig .",
    "4 , we conclude that the average extinction to the embedded cluster is a@xmath26 @xmath1 15 ( h - k = 1 ) .",
    "assuming spherical geometry , then background stars are seen through a@xmath26 @xmath1 30 .",
    "therefore , in simulating the background of the region , we added an extinction value of a@xmath26 = 30 mag ( or a@xmath28 = 3.36 mag ) to the background stars .",
    "then we scaled the model prediction to the star counts in the reference field , and subtracted the combined foreground ( d @xmath18 1.8 kpc ) and background ( d @xmath4 1.8 kpc with a@xmath28 = 3.36 mag ) data from the klf of the w3 main region . after correcting for the foreground and background star contamination and photometric completeness ,",
    "the resulting klfs are presented in fig . 8 for the cluster and whole w3 main regions .",
    "both the klfs follow power - laws in shape .",
    "we estimate a total of 156 sources with k @xmath18 17.5 in the cluster region after applying the corrections for completeness and foreground and background star contamination . given a distance of 1.83 kpc and assuming that the cluster is spherical with an apparent radius of 30  ( 0.27 pc ) , we derive a cluster density of @xmath1 2000 stars pc@xmath29 for k @xmath18 17.5 .",
    "the observed density of other embedded clusters is typically lower than @xmath1 1000 stars pc@xmath29 ( lada & lada 2003 ; carpenter et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the high density of stars in w3 main may be a result of the youth of the cluster and the enormous mass of molecular gas available in the w3 main molecular core ( megeath et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in fig .",
    "8 , a power - law with a slope @xmath11 ( @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of stars brighter than @xmath32 ) has been fitted to each klf using a linear least - squares fitting routine .",
    "the derived power - law slopes for various regions in w3 main are shown in table 2 .",
    "we find that our estimate of the power - law slopes is in remarkable agreement with that of megeath et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in spite of the larger survey area which includes objects such as compact h ii , uc h ii , and diffuse h ii regions .",
    "our results therefore confirm that the klf of the w3 main region shows a power - law slope which is lower than those generally reported for the young embedded clusters ( @xmath33 , e.g. lada et al .",
    "1991 , 1993 ; lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "thus , this low value of the slope is indeed an intrinsic property of the stellar population in this region . as shown in detail by megeath et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the estimated klf slopes of the whole w3 main region are roughly consistent with the miller - scalo imf if the age of w3 population is @xmath1 0.31 myr .      fig .",
    "9 shows the cm diagram ( j - h vs j ) for @xmath1 160 yso candidate sources identified in figs .",

    "solid oblique reddening line denotes position of pms with 2 m@xmath6 for 1 myr and the dotted oblique lines denote positions of pms with 2 and 4 m@xmath6 for 0.3 myr , respectively .",
    "most of the objects well above the pms tracks are luminous and massive zams stars ( see table 1 & fig .",
    "we use the j luminosity rather than that of h or k@xmath0 , as j - band is less affected by the emission from circumstellar materials ( bertout , basri , & bouvier 1988 ) .",
    "if we assume that the age of the stars in the w3 main star forming region is @xmath1 0.3 myr , 86% of the yso candidates detected in j , h , and k@xmath0-bands have masses less than 4 m@xmath6 ( fig . 9 ) and at least 80% of the stars",
    "have masses less than 2 m@xmath6 .",
    "even if the age of the stars is 1 myr , 75% of the stars have masses below 2 m@xmath6 . at the distance of 1.83",
    "kpc , assuming an age in the range 0.31 myr , and an extinction at k band between 0 and 1 mag ( up to a@xmath26 @xmath1 10 ) , the magnitude limit ( corresponding to the 90% completeness level ) corresponds to m @xmath1 0.4 m@xmath6 , according to the pms evolutionary tracks from palla & stahler ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , at our 10 @xmath3 mag detection limit , the mass would then go down to @xmath1 0.1 m@xmath6 .",
    "this gives an estimate of the lowest mass limits of the detected stars in the w3 main star forming region in our sample .",

    "it is generally agreed that w4 (= ic 1805 ) , located to the east of w3 , was the first of the three large h ii regions to be formed and that its expansion might have recently triggered star formation towards the w3 molecular cloud ( elmegreen & lada 1977 , dickel et al .",
    "1980 , thronson et al . 1985 ,",
    "carpenter et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the close association of the embedded clusters with adjacent h ii regions also suggests that triggering may have played an important role in the formation of these clusters ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",

    "our finding also confirms the previous results of megeath et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for a smaller region around w3 irs 5 .",
    "\\4 ) the observed density of the cluster region around w3 irs 5 is @xmath1 2000 stars pc@xmath29 for k @xmath18 17.5 , which is larger than the typical values ( @xmath1 1000 stars pc@xmath29 ) reported for other embedded clusters .",
