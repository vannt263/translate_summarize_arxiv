    ", we will see that the notion of holonomicity for a sequence of laurent polynomials _ naturally leads _ to a @xmath0-weyl ring @xmath30 defined below .",

    "then , using the abbreviation @xmath82 , gelca and frohman introduced in @xcite the quantum peripheral and orthogonal ideals of @xmath2 ( the latter was called _",

    "\\(a ) we have : @xmath102 in particular , the colored jones function of a knot determines its quantum orthogonal ideal .",
    "( b ) @xmath103 is invariant under the ring involution @xmath104 .",
    "the proof of the above theorem proves the following corollary which compares the _ orthogonality relations _ of gelca ( * ? ? ? *",
    "sec.3 ) with the recursion relations given here :    fix an element @xmath32 of the quantum orthogonal ideal of a knot .",
    "the orthogonality relation for the colored jones function is @xmath105 .",
    "on the other hand , theorem [ thm.2 ] implies that @xmath106 .",
    "it follows that a @xmath107-term recursion relation for the colored jones function given by gelca is implied by a @xmath108-term recursion relation .",

    "the nontriviality of the classical peripheral ideal was known for hyperbolic knots .",
    "later on , the nontriviality was shown by n. dunfield and the author for all knots in @xmath65 , @xcite .",
    "combined with our theorem [ thm.2 ] below , the surjection of the specialization map ( that sets @xmath109 ) would prove theorem [ thm.gl ] .",
    "unfortunately , there is an error in the argument of frohman and gelca . instead , the surjection of the specialization map became known as the aj conjecture , formulated by the author in @xcite . for a state - of - the art knowledge on the aj conjecture , see @xcite and especially @xcite .",
    "the latter gives a friendly discussion of the classical and quantum peripheral and orthogonal ideals of a knot .",
    "we now have all the ingredients to translates difference equations for @xmath110 to differential equations for @xmath111 .",

    "x. sun and the author will prove in a forthcoming paper that all _ twist knots _ are regular .    among other reasons ,",
    "regularity is important because of the following .",
