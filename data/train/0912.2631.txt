    "a proper understanding of coherent pion production is very important in the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments since pion production is a source of background  @xcite . with pions being mainly produced through the excitation of nucleon resonances ,",
    "coherent production can be used to extract information on axial form factors for the nucleon - to - resonance transition .    in coherent production",
    "the nucleus remains in its ground state and the reaction is controlled by the nucleus form factor .",
    "the nucleus form factor favors small values of the nucleus momentum transfer squared @xmath3 .",
    "small @xmath3 values imply in this reaction small @xmath2 ( square of the lepton momentum transfer ) . for small @xmath2 ,",
    "coherent pion production is dominated by the divergence of the axial current and it can thus be related to the pion - nucleus coherent scattering through the partial conservation of the axial current ( pcac ) hypothesis .",
    "experimental analyses of the coherent reaction rely on the rein ",
    "sehgal ( rs ) model  @xcite which is based on pcac . in the rs model",
    "the pion - nucleus coherent cross section is written in terms of the pion - nucleon elastic cross section by means of approximations that are valid for high neutrino energies and small @xmath3 and @xmath2 values . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , those approximations are not reliable for neutrino energies below / around 1 gev and light nuclei , like carbon or oxygen .",
    "there are other approaches to coherent production that do not rely on pcac but on microscopic models for pion production at the nucleon level  @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution to the elementary amplitude at low energies is given by the @xmath4-pole mechanism ( @xmath4 excitation and its subsequent decay into pion nucleon ) .",
    "medium effects like the modification of the @xmath4 mass and width in the medium , final pion distortion , evaluated by solving the klein - gordon equation for a pion - nucleus optical potential , as well as nonlocalities in the pion momentum , are very important and are taken into account in microscopic calculations . in the microscopic model of ref .",
    "@xcite background terms were included on top of the dominant @xmath4-pole contribution .",
    "the least known ingredients of the model are the axial @xmath1 transition form factors , of which @xmath5 gives the largest contribution ( see eq .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite for a form factor decomposition of the @xmath1 weak current ) . besides , within the adler model  @xcite used in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath5 determines all other axial form factors .",
    "this strongly suggested the readjustment of that form factor to the experimental data , which the authors did by fitting the flux - averaged @xmath6 argonne ( anl )  @xcite @xmath2-differential cross section for pion - nucleon invariant masses @xmath7 gev , for which the model should be appropriate .",
    "they found @xmath8 which is some 30% smaller than the value predicted by the off - diagonal goldberger - treiman ( gt ) relation that predicts @xmath9 .",
    "background terms turn out to play a minor role in coherent production  @xcite where a reduced @xmath10 value gives rise to smaller cross sections .",
    "coherent production is dominated by the axial current which in microscopic models is , in its turn , dominated by the @xmath5 axial form factor .",
    "coherent production could then be used to test the validity of different @xmath0 dependences in the small @xmath2 region .    in this contribution",
    "we will concentrate on the two issues mentioned before : first , we will try to see how sensitive coherent production is to different @xmath0 parameterizations proposed in the literature .",
    "second , we will present results that show how and why the rs model fails for low energy pion coherent production on light nuclei .",
    "as mentioned before , in ref .  @xcite the authors made a fit of @xmath0 to anl data .",
    "for @xmath11 they took the @xmath2 dependence of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath12 and from the fit they obtained @xmath13 this fitted axial mass in the weak @xmath1 vertex is in good agreement with the estimates of about 0.95 gev and 0.84 gev given in the original anl reference  @xcite and in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a correction of the order of 30% to the off - diagonal gt relation value was found for @xmath10 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the agreement with anl total cross sections improved with the fitted values for @xmath10 and @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand it is also shown that brookhaven ( bnl ) bubble chamber data  @xcite and anl data are not fully compatible and that bnl data alone would favor a @xmath15 value as given by the off - diagonal gt relation .",
    "a different approach has been followed by leitner _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", the authors use a different parameterization for @xmath0 @xmath16 in which @xmath10 is kept to its off - diagonal gt relation value @xmath17 , while @xmath18 and @xmath14 are treated as free parameters .",
    "one can accommodate a larger @xmath10 value by changing the @xmath2 dependence .",
    "in fact very small @xmath19 values are not very relevant due to phase space and what is actually important is the @xmath0 value in the region around @xmath20gev@xmath21 .",
    "when fitting the anl data with the @xmath4-pole term alone they got  @xcite @xmath22 but background terms are important at the nucleon level and they should be included in the calculation . a new fit including background terms leads to @xmath23 both",

    "[ eq : c5amosel ] and [ eq : parfullmosel ] give a good description of anl data even though they use quite different values for @xmath10 .",
    "the different @xmath2 dependence compensates for the initial difference at @xmath24 .",
    "note , however , the large errors in eq .",
    "[ eq : parfullmosel ] that point at large correlations between the different parameters . in fig .",
