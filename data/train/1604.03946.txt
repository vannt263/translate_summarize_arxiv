    "the first stars in the universe ( so  called population iii , or pop - iii , stars ) are believed to have formed from the metal  free gas available in the very early universe , in pristine conditions .",
    "their redshift distribution is still a matter of debate .",
    "theoretical arguments suggest pop - iii stars could form at redshifts as low as @xmath1 @xcite , and be the dominant population up to @xmath2 .",
    "recently it has been shown that pop - iii gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) could be the dominant population among transients detected at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "determining the role that pop - iii stars played in the early universe is an important question .",
    "it has been long postulated that the start of the epoch of re - ionisation could have been set off by the first generation of stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; pop - iii stars could have played a significant role in chemically enriching the primordial inter - galactic medium ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , and could constitute the seeds of primordial black holes .    the nature of pop - iii stars is a subject of much discussion .",
    "pop - iii stars could be extremely massive ( @xmath4 ; see e.g. @xcite ) , or have masses as low as few - to - several tens of @xmath5 @xcite . in either case , the low - opacity envelope should keep large amount of gas bound till the pre  explosion phase @xcite . the black hole formed",
    "would be more massive than the ones formed by pop - ii stars , and would experience a longer than usual accretion phase @xcite .",
    "observing gamma - ray bursts from pop - iii stars would give us a way of learning something about their early universe progenitors .",
    "long ( @xmath6s ) grbs ( lgrbs ) are the brightest transients known in the universe . according to the standard collapsar model @xcite grbs signpost the birth of a black hole . in the standard model , the collapse of a massive star , such as a wolf ",
    "rayet @xcite , leads to the formation of an accretion disk or torus that accretes on timescales of tens of seconds onto the newly born black hole , and a jet is formed . if jets can escape the stellar envelope , and successfully reconvert a fraction of their kinetic energy into radiation , x - rays and @xmath7-rays are produced as _",
    "prompt emission _ @xcite . at a later stage , when the rest of the bulk kinetic energy is converted , the _ afterglow emission",
    "_ takes place at lower frequencies and lasts up to months after the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "approximately 300 lgrbs with a measured redshift have been detected to date , largely by the _",
    "swift _  satellite @xcite .",
    "the redshift distribution of the known lgrbs peaks at around @xmath8 @xcite , with a tail extending to higher redshifts .",
    "the highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed pop - ii grb ( grb  090423 ) lies at @xmath9 @xcite and the highest redshift photometrically confirmed one is at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "current models suggest that detection of a grb afterglow from a pop - iii star is within the capability of current facilities ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "an exceptionally high energy budget ( @xmath11 erg ) and long @xmath7ray duration compared to the rest of the grb population would be distinctive properties of pop - iii progenitors .",
    "nonetheless , these objects have proven to be elusive so far .",
    "it has long been known that the @xmath7ray band _",
    "alone _ is ineffective in selecting candidates , because the intrinsically long durations , coupled with the very high @xmath12 , produce barely detectable signals with the standard `` rate trigger '' criteria of the _ swift_/bat telescope @xcite .",
    "the infrared band is somewhat more promising .",
    "@xcite indicated that both the widefield infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) could observe rather weak afterglows in the first tens of days post burst .",
    "@xcite estimated the detection probability and prospects for pop - iii progenitors observed either by the space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics ( spica ) and jwst .",
    "they found that the most likely mode of detection was through follow - up of high - energy triggered events , and so the success of these instruments in detecting pop - iii grbs depends on which high - energy instruments are available during the period in which spica and jwst are operating .    given these constraints , it is possible that the radio band could be the most promising region of the spectrum to look at ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed by @xcite , if a pop - iii grb is a scaled - up version of a standard grb in terms of the kinetic energy budget , then its radio flux would peak at late times ( several weeks ) at gigahertz frequencies , and be brighter than a standard pop - ii grb .",
    "the challenge is how to identify the most promising pop - iii grb candidates to follow - up at late times .",
    "the focus of previous works has been investigating the detection prospects for future facilities .",
    "however , due to the negative k  correction , it is possible to use radio observations with existing instruments to test whether pop - iii grbs are already present in the _ swift _  sample .    in this paper",
    "we explore the hypothesis that particularly long and dim grbs detected by _ swift _  and with no ir detection could originate from pop - iii progenitors . to this aim",
    "we search for bright late time emission in the radio band which is expected according to some pop - iii grbs models @xcite .",
    "these grbs , identified from _ swift_/bat triggers , would initially appear indistinguishable from standard grbs .",
    "however , at late times they could be identified by their radio brightness .",
    "we have conducted a pilot experiment with the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) , in order to test this hypothesis . in section  [ sec : ag ] we detail how we modelled the afterglow emission . in section  [ sec : sample ] we present the sample selection methodology and describe our observations .",
    "we present our results in section  [ sec : results ] and discuss the implications of our results in section  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "in the radio band , synchrotron self - absorption suppresses the afterglow emission from the forward shock in the first few days after the explosion . as a result",
    ", this component is expected to rise until the dominant frequency ( be it the injection frequency of the electrons in the shock , or the synchrotron self - absorption frequency itself ) passes through the observational band .",
    "this effect produces a spectral peak in the lightcurve of a grb afterglow . after the transition from the ` thick ' to the ` thin ' regime , the flux density of the afterglow declines as a power law , with an index that depends on the slope of the electron distribution in the shock that generated it .    to model the afterglow emission we used ` boxfit `  @xcite .",
    "this code is based on 2d numerical simulations of the jet dynamics , and radiation is posited to be synchrotron from shock accelerated electrons . only the forward shock of the afterglow phase is considered , and only the adiabatic approximation ( no radiative losses are considered , see @xcite ) .",
    "another caveat is that the code does not take into account the possible contribution to the observed radiation of a self - compton component .",
    "the flux density at any given frequency therefore depends on a set of _ macro - physical _ parameters such as the kinetic energy of the jet ( ) , the redshift of the grb , and the opening angle of the jet .",
    "the _ micro - physical _ free parameters prescribe how the energy is partitioned at the shock front between electrons ( @xmath13 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath14 ) , and the slope @xmath15 of the initial electron energy distribution .",
    "finally , the circumburst medium density @xmath16 is assumed constant .      to set a baseline for our modelling we investigated whether the afterglow model confirmed that looking at the x - ray afterglows only would not be sufficient to identify the pop - iii nature of the progenitor stars . to do this",
    "we compared the results of our simulations with the x - ray afterglows of all the _ swift _  grbs from the so - called bat6 sample @xcite .",
    "this is a flux - limited sample of grbs which is 97% complete in redshift .",
    "for this reason , no bias induced by the measure of @xmath12 should affect it .",
    "the high flux cutoff ( 2.6 ph/@xmath17/s , in the energy range 15150 kev ) ensures bat6 to be free from the threshold biases that affect the grb detector .",
    "it has been extensively used for a number of studies that benefit from its completeness , e.g. optical afterglows @xcite , the luminosity function of lgrbs @xcite , the absorption properties in the x - ray afterglows @xcite , as well as a number of studies of the radio properties of lgrbs both pointing to the earth @xcite and orphan afterglows @xcite .",
    "it also served as a baseline for making predictions on rates of grb detections by the square kilometre array @xcite .",
    "the x - ray lightcurves come from the _ swift_/xrt lightcurve repository @xcite and are in units of mjy at 10  kev , i.e. they have been extrapolated to the upper boundary of the xrt energy band , and are effectively monochromatic flux densities .",
    "this is readily comparable to the output of the set of simulations .",
    "the set of microphysical parameters ( e.g. @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , n ) in our simulations is poorly constrained by observations due to the fact that a true multi - wavelength sampling of afterglows exists for a limited number of grbs .",
    "@xcite derived this set five years before the launch of the _ swift _  satellite , and only a handful of estimates have been collected in more recent years ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative approach is to use simulations to determine which set of parameters best reproduces the distribution of flux densities of the whole population of grbs in various energy bands .",
    "@xcite ( radio ) and @xcite ( optical , x - ray ) showed that , on average , the x - ray , optical and radio flux density distributions of the complete sample of _ swift _",
    "bursts can be reproduced assuming ( @xmath15 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) = [ 2.3 , 0.02 , 0.008 ] , with some dispersion in the range [ 2.3 , 0.01 - 0.05 , 0.001 - 0.01 ] .",
    "we adopted these fiducial set of micro - physical parameters for our simulations in fig .",
    "[ xrayb6 ] .      despite the knowledge that the x - ray afterglow of a grb is likely contaminated by the long  lasting activity of a central engine ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or late - time reactivation of the same engine ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we wanted to test whether a very energetic pop - iii grb in the current dataset could be identified through x - ray observations .    in fig .",
    "[ xrayb6 ] we compare the x - ray lightcurves of the whole bat6 sample at 10  kev ( grey dots in the background ) , with synthetic lightcurves generated with ` boxfit ` .",
    "we simulated a whole range of events , varying the microphysical and macrophysical parameters to see what parameter space the resulting simulated lightcurves at 10  kev would span .",
    "we notice that the largest contributors to the spread in the simulated lightcurves are , by far ,  and @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting green shaded area in the lower left area of the plot , represents the envelope of simulated possibilities with varying microphysics , jet and observing angles : we chose a grb with the highest  ever observed , corresponding to @xmath18  erg put at @xmath19 , for the upper boundary .",
    "for reference , we chose a grb at the average redshift and energetics of the bat6 sample : @xmath20 and @xmath21  erg ( which corresponds to log()@xmath22 , i.e. the average value reported in @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to the lower boundary of the simulated x  ray afterglow lightcurves . note that our modelling considers just the afterglow component , therefore it is not surprising that other additional components in the observed x ",
    "ray afterglows are `` missed '' by the modelling . in other words , the lower boundary of the green area , is a safety - check on the assumptions we made on the distribution of parameters .    in a similar fashion , the purple shaded area in the lower left area of the plot ,",
    "shows the span of simulated lightcurves for a very energetic event @xmath23  erg in the redshift range @xmath24 .",
    "we can draw several conclusions from figure  [ xrayb6 ] :    * the two macrophysical parameters  and @xmath12 are degenerate ; they dominate over the microphysical parameters in the variance of the lightcurve evolution : small variations in the observing angle or equipartition parameters produce lightcurves which are well within the span of lightcurves which are plotted in green and purple colours ; * all simulated x  ray curves are consistent with the bat6 x  ray afterglow parameter space , which in turn means that even the most energetic ( a potential pop iii , close - by ) case would nt show up as an obvious outlier in x  ray observations ; * the ` reference case ' scenario lies at the lower boundary of the observed xrt data .",
    "this is not surprising since ` boxfit `  only models the external shock component of an afterglow , which we know is just part of the observed x - rays .",
    "in fact , the x  ray afterglow component has to be seen just a lower limit to the real radiative output of an actual grbs ( especially at relatively early times ) ; * in the first 12 hours after the grb , the reference case is indistinguishable from a grb ten times more energetic ( i.e. albeit still consistent with the current  distribution of observed grbs ) , but placed at @xmath19 . according to @xcite roughly 50% of grbs at that redshift still come from popi / ii stars .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the x  ray observations are not good predictors for the nature of the progenitor star .    in the upper - right section of the plot we run the same set of simulations , this time at 17  ghz .",
    "some interesting features can immediately be appreciated :    * the most energetic events peak at several tens of days after the grb trigger , and they could peak at @xmath25  mjy . * at @xmath26  days the flux densities for all simulated grbs span a very large range , depending on the specific parameters setting . in the case of energetic events ( the purple band ) , they should easily be visible _ independently _ from their distance because their peak flux is well within the capabilities of current telescopes .",
    "* the effect of negative k  correction , particularly visible in the purple upper shaded band , shows that at a fixed energy , even an extreme difference in distance produces just a small difference in peak time .",
    "the peak flux is more affected , with the @xmath19 grb having a smaller flux , as expected .",
    "hence , a late - time observation ( later than @xmath27 days ) in the ghz regime that resulted in a clear detection , would point to an extreme energy of the grb explosion . in the regime that can be currently observed routinely with existing facilities ( tens of @xmath0jy , but see @xcite for the prospects for the ska telescope ) , one detection would already point to the extreme nature of the event .",
    "a set of observations distributed around the time of the peak would constrain the possible combinations of  and @xmath12 .",
    "our simulations confirmed that a pop - iii grb even with a out - of - the - ordinary energy budget and distance , would still produce an x - ray afterglow consistent with the flux density level typically observed in low redshift grbs . as a result , observations of early x - ray afterglows do not seem like a good way of selecting candidate pop - iii progenitors , while the radio regime seems to herald a much stronger predictive power on the extreme nature of a grb , provided that its flux peaks and is still bright at very late times ( tens to hundreds of days ) .",
    "as our simulations have shown , x - ray afterglows alone are not good predictors of the extreme nature of a pop - iii grbs .",
    "hence we based our candidate selection on the _ swift_/bat properties of grbs . in figure",
    "[ candidates ] we show a plot of the peak flux of the grb prompt emission as seen by bat versus the duration of the event in the energy range 15350  kev ( black dots ) .",
    "this is the full sample of 872 long duration grbs detected between the launch of the _ swift _  satellite and the end of december 2012 .",
    "given that we expect a long , dim afterglow both due to the combined effect of cosmic dilation and the assumption that a pop - iii progenitor could be a very massive star , we selected our candidates according to the following criteria :    * prompt duration longer than 100  s in the observer s frame ; * peak flux ( in the 15350  kev energy range ) smaller than 0.6  ph  @xmath28  s@xmath29 ; * triggered bat in image trigger mode .",
    "the first two criteria select the bottom - right area of the plane in figure  [ candidates ] .",
    "the objects that satisfy the image trigger mode condition are shown as blue squares in the plot .",
    "the bat image trigger mode is more sensitive to slower and dimmer transients that the standard rate trigger mode , which looks for a sudden increase in the source light curve . applying",
    "these criteria resulted in a sample of 26 grbs .    from this sample",
    "we further selected sources for which there was no measured redshift ( i.e. no distance information ) .",
    "this is because we expect extremely high redshift candidates be undetected in the optical and ir bands , preventing a direct measure of their distance .",
    "finally , candidates had to be at a reasonably low latitude to be observed with the atca .",
    "these additional selection criteria resulted in 3 candidates : grb  110210a , grb  121001a , and grb  111215a . to these we added grb  120401a , which satisfied all the selection criteria , with the exception of the distance information",
    " as it has a photometric redshift of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we used grb  120401a as a control candidate , for which we expected to not be able to reach the flux density needed to observe the afterglow .    for each of these three candidates",
    ", we aimed at obtaining a detection .",
    "we fine - tuned the parameters of the mock lightcurves at 10  kev in order to be consistent with the observed _ swift _  data .",
    "we verified that both a standard grb and a pop - iii grb would be able to roughly reproduce the x  ray observations . with these parameter choices",
    ", we generated the lightcurves at 17  ghz at late times , to estimate the expected order - of - magnitude radio flux in both a `` standard '' and a pop - iii scenario .",
    "given that all of the pop - iii estimates were within reach of the atca ( while the `` standard '' ones were order of magnitudes dimmer ) , once we had a confirmed observational window , we double - checked again the predicted flux at that exact time .",
    "the predictions can be found in table  [ tab : results ] , and the corresponding light curves are shown by solid blue ( standard ) and red ( pop - iii ) lines in fig .",

    "although our experiment was based on only a small sample ( three ) of potential candidates , the lack of detection at one to two orders of magnitude below our predicted flux suggests one of the following possibilities .",
    "firstly , it could be that one or more of the assumptions in our simulations is wrong , even though the forward shock of a pop - iii progenitor follows the same standard model implemented by the ` boxfit `  code .",
    "for example , it may be that the macro - physics parameters we adopted do not apply to this case .",
    "it might well be that pop - iii stars have no exceptionally large masses , but rather lie in the few tens of solar masses , just like the progenitors of the grbs we know of .",
    "if that were the case , the kinetic energy available as a reservoir for conversion into radiation would nt be substantially different than normal grbs .",
    "another macro - physical assumption could relate to the redshift distribution of the elusive population of pop - iii stars .",
    "there are indications ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the pop - iii progenitors could be @xmath38% of the whole population at @xmath39 and as high as 40% at @xmath40 .",
    "another possibility is that the micro - physics assumptions are incorrect .",
    "for instance , if the circumburst particle density were orders of magnitude smaller than the range we simulated , the flux density would be consistent with a non - detection .    secondly ,",
    "but less likely in our opinion , is the possibility that the assumptions are reasonable while at the same time the physics governing the external shock of a pop - iii progenitor producing a grb is different than the one simulated .",
    "this would require more exotic solutions , the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "thirdly , there could have been a combination of the aforementioned possibilities , and a truly exceptional grb is needed to be observable by current facilities .",
    "a more thorough search through the whole sample of grbs is needed , and a close eye kept on the promising candidates .",
    "in particular we would like to point out that there is also the case of `` dark bursts '' , i.e. grbs that come from standard progenitors but likely exploded in non - standard circumburst environments which absorb most of their optical photons ( preventing a fast measurement of their distance ) that will contaminate our sample ( and may be larger in number ) .",
    "indeed , during the completion of this manuscript , one of the sources in our sample , i.e. grb  111215a was revealed to belong to this class by a large observational campaign spanning over two years .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of the now available radio and ir properties of this grb , as well as a discussion on the deep observations of its host galaxy .",
    "finally , we should consider using this initial result , to test more refined ways to select the potential pop - iii progenitors .",
    "grbs from a pop - iii progenitor have proven so far elusive , and therefore belong only to the realm of theoretical simulations .",
    "nonetheless , if these objects do exist , they might not only be observable by the next generation of facilities , but could have been hiding already in our samples , disguised as more `` standard '' objects .",
    "the inspection of a single energy band can not give us the hint we have been looking for .",
    "the x  ray band is not a good predictor of the extreme energy ( or not ) of the initial explosion , since the kinetic energy budget and the redshift @xmath12 are degenerate in this respect .",
    "the optical / nir flux is severely affected by the the shift of the ly@xmath41 break in the observed band , and hence very high redshift pop - iii grbs are unlikely to be detectable .",
    "our simulations have shown that late time radio observations may be the best diagnostic for distinguishing a pop - iii grb from a standard one .",
    "the former is expected to be orders of magnitude brighter than the latter , and within the reach of current radio facilities .",
    "more importantly , a single detection of a radio afterglow peaking at late times ( hundreds of days ) would immediately rule out the `` standard '' nature of its progenitor .",
    "we used the hydrodynamical code ` boxfit `  @xcite , which allows to compute the synchrotron flux at any frequency , at any time , given a set of fixed parameters , to set up an experiment with the atca at ghz frequencies .",
    "we selected the candidates by means of the combined low @xmath7-ray peak flux , the long duration of the prompt emission , the lack of optical / ir information that would help measure at least a lower limit on the grb distance , and the image trigger criterion of the bat instrument .",
    "we fixed the parameters which regulate the physics of the shock to values that allow us to be consistent with the observed x  ray data .",
    "we showed that , despite being indistinguishable at x  ray energies in the first day , the different nature of the progenitors would produce remarkably different behaviours at ghz frequencies , both in the peak flux density reached and in the time at which the transition to the optically thin regime would take place , producing a radio peak . with a few hours of observations on three candidates , we did not have a detection .",
    "we attribute this to a number of possible reasons , which could be either physical in nature ( e.g. the pop - iii progenitors do not have substantially different mass distributions , or -like in the case of grb  111215a- to it s `` dark '' nature , see @xcite ) or observational ( e.g. a sample of just three candidates is not big enough to claim the non - existence of pop - iii progenitors ) .",
    "we encourage nonetheless the community to use this initial result to envisage more detailed methods to select promising candidates in the quest for the observation of the first pop - iii progenitor star , before these objects become directly observable by future facilities .",
