    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 are two of the most important channels to search for the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , together covering the theoretically allowed higgs mass range . in this talk",
    ", we present higgs search results in these channels by the atlas experiment at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    the data sample used in these analyses was collected by atlas during the period march - june 2011 , and corresponds to 1.04 fb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : lumi_tot ] shows the 7 tev collision data accumulated by atlas in 2011 as function of time . at the time this article is written , the total recorded data correspond to 3.51 fb@xmath2 , of which less than one - third was used for the results reported herein .",
    "the uncertainty on the luminosity measurement is 3.7% .",
    "figure  [ fig : lumi_tot ] also shows the evolution of the instantaneous luminosity @xmath6 as a function of time in 2011 . for the results that follow , the maximum @xmath6 reached was 1.26 @xmath7 @xmath8 s@xmath2 .",
    "the average number of proton - proton interactions per bunch crossing was about 6 .",
    "the @xmath0 channel takes advantage of the large branching ratio of the @xmath9 decay , which is about 2/3 at the higgs mass @xmath10 of 120 gev ( figure  [ fig : higgs_br ] ) . owing to the very large background of prompt @xmath11 pairs , a direct search for the @xmath9 decay",
    "is extremely difficult at the lhc .",
    "however , higgs production associated with a leptonically decaying @xmath12 or @xmath13 boson makes the search easier , since the lepton can be triggered on , and the lepton requirement can be used to reduce the large @xmath11 background . as a reference ,",
    "the cross - section @xmath14 branching ratio of the process @xmath0 is about 91 fb for @xmath10 = 120 gev .",
    "a cut - based analysis is performed and its strategy is simple : we require two @xmath15-tagged jets in addition to @xmath12 boson search criteria .",
    "a higgs signal would show up as an excess in a @xmath11 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "since the @xmath12 boson can decay into an electron or a muon , the analysis is performed separately for the electron and muon channels . in each channel , we require that events pass the lowest - threshold unprescaled trigger : this threshold is 20 gev and 18 gev for the electron and muon channels respectively .",
    "further event selection criteria are listed below :    * exactly one reconstructed lepton in the event .",
    "the lepton must have at least 25 gev transverse momentum ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "an electron must be within the pseudorapidity range @xmath17 ; a muon must be within @xmath18 .",
    "* exactly two jets in the event , reconstructed using the anti - k@xmath19 algorithm with a distance parameter r = 0.4 . each jet must have @xmath20 gev and be within @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , each jet must be tagged as a @xmath15-jet .",

    "the sidebands are defined as @xmath30 80 gev and 140 @xmath31 250 gev .",
    "the shape and normalization of the top background are cross - checked by defining a top control region in data defined by having three jets in the event , two of which must be @xmath15-tagged .",
