    "the classical action of the model is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the 5-dimensional metric , with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the 5-th dimension coordinate of the size @xmath5 .",
    "the quantities @xmath6 are induced metrics on the branes , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are brane lagrangians , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .    as in the original rs model  @xcite ,",
    "the periodicity @xmath11 is imposed and the points @xmath12 and @xmath13 are identified .",
    "thus , we get the orbifold @xmath14 .",
    "there are two 3d branes located at the fixed points @xmath15 ( plank brane ) and @xmath16 ( tev brane ) .",
    "the sm fields are constrained to the tev brane , while the gravity propagates in all spatial dimensions .    in order to solve einstein - hilbert s equations which follow from the action ( [ kisselev : action ] ) , it is assumed that the background metric respects 4-dimensional poincare invariance @xmath17 thus , the 5-dimensional metric tensor has the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the minkowski tensor @xmath21 .",

    "the quantity @xmath24 defines the curvature of the 5-dimensional space - time .    in the rssc model",
    "the hierarchy relation looks like @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the reduced planck scale , and @xmath27 is the _ reduced _ fundamental gravity scale .",
    "@xmath27 is related to the 5-dimensional planck scale as @xmath28    the masses of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) graviton excitations @xmath29 are proportional to @xmath24 , @xmath30 the interaction lagrangian of gravitons is given by @xcite , @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the energy - momentum tensor of the sm fields on the tev brane , and @xmath33    note that in the rssc model the mass spectrum ( [ kisselev : graviton_masses ] ) and experimental signature are similar to those in the add model with one flat extra dimension  @xcite .",
    "let us remember that the original rs model predicts heavy graviton resonances .",
    "in the framework of the rssc model  @xcite , @xcite , gravity effects can be searched for in the dilepton production ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 in particular , the @xmath36-distribution of the final leptons in the process ( [ kisselev : process ] ) is given by the formula @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the distribution of the parton of the type @xmath39 in momentum fraction @xmath40 inside the proton taken at the scale @xmath41 .",

    "the contribution of the virtual gravitons to lepton pair production comes from the quark - antiquark annihilation and gluon - gluon fusion , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are mandelstam variables of the subprocess .",
    "the sum @xmath50 is the invariant part of the partonic matrix elements , with @xmath51 being total width of the graviton with the kk number @xmath52 and mass @xmath53  @xcite @xmath54 note that the function @xmath55 is universal for all processes mediated by @xmath56-channel virtual gravitons .          in papers",

    "the gravity mediated contributions to the cross sections do not include the sm contribution .",
    "[ kisselev : fig:2 ] demonstrates that an ignorance of the graviton widths would be a rough approximation since it results in very large suppression of the gravity contributions .",
