    "high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) in cuprates occurs as a result of doping of a parent antiferromagnetic mott insulator and properties of cuprates change significantly with doping .",
    "superconductivity in overdoped cuprates is fairly well described by the conventional bcs - type second - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "but properties of underdoped cuprates are abnormal due to the persistence of the normal state pseudogap , strong superconducting fluctuations , or possibly preformed pairing , @xcite and magnetism @xcite at @xmath3 .",
    "there are indications that the transition from the normal to the abnormal behavior occurs abruptly at a critical doping point @xcite .",
    "this may be a consequence of the quantum phase transition - a phase transition , which occurs at @xmath4 , in frustrated systems as a result of a competition of coexisting order parameters .",
    "the coexistence of superconductivity at @xmath5 with the pseudogap @xcite , charge and spin density order @xcite was indeed reported by several techniques .",
    "clearly , detailed doping - dependent studies are needed both for understanding the puzzling nature of htsc in cuprates and for the development of novel htsc materials .    usually , the mobile carrier concentration is controlled by chemical doping via chemical substitution , or in case of cuprates also by variation of the oxygen content via appropriate annealing and subsequent quenching to room temperature .",
    "this allows an accurate control of the chemical composition , but less so of the local arrangement of impurities and disorder , which is equally important for cuprates @xcite .",
    "for example , it is well established that properties of the @xmath6 compound strongly depend not only on the average oxygen concentration but also crucially on the order / disorder of oxygen atoms in cu - o - cu chains @xcite .",
    "therefore , analysis of the doping phase diagram of cuprates requires accurate control of both , the concentration and the microscopic structure of impurities .",
    "the carrier concentration can be also varied via two physical doping processes , well established for semiconductors : photo - doping @xcite and through the electric - field effect @xcite . in case of cuprates , physical doping may be persistent at low temperatures in a sense that it is relaxing very slowly after removing the light @xcite or field @xcite .",
    "recently , a persistent electric doping via strong current injection was discovered @xcite .",
    "it is resembling a resistive switching phenomenon in memristor devices @xcite and is related to previous similar observations in point contact experiments on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi-2212 ) @xcite .",
    "such an electric doping is reversible , reproducible and easily controllable .",
    "it opens a possibility to analyze the doping dependence of htsc on one sample without changing its chemical composition @xcite . despite that",
    ", there were very few direct spectroscopic studies of cuprates employing physical doping techniques .",
    "intrinsic tunneling spectroscopy ( its ) provides an unique opportunity to probe bulk electronic properties of htsc @xcite .",
    "this technique utilizes weak interlayer ( @xmath2-axis ) coupling in quasi two dimensional htsc compounds , in which mobile charge carriers are confined in cuo@xmath0 planes separated by some blocking layer ( e.g. sro-2bio - sro in case of bi-2212 ) .",
    "this leads to a formation of atomic scale intrinsic tunnel junctions , and to an appearance of the intrinsic josephson effect at @xmath7 @xcite .    in this work",
    "we employ the persistent electric doping for analysis of the doping dependence of electronic spectra of bi-2212 single crystals by means of intrinsic tunneling spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "controllable and reversible persistent physical doping is achieved by applying a @xmath2-axis voltage of a few volts to small bi-2212 mesa structures .",
    "thus we are able to change the doping state of bi-2212 single crystals without changing its chemical composition .",
    "a wide doping range from a moderately underdoped to strongly overdoped state could be reached .",
    "it is observed that the physical doping is affecting the intrinsic tunneling characteristics of bi-2212 similar to chemical doping @xcite . with overdoping the critical temperature and the superconducting gap decrease . with underdoping the pseudogap rapidly increases , indicative for the presence of the quantum critical doping point in the phase diagram , and the @xmath2-axis critical current density rapidly decreases , indicating a progressively more incoherent interlayer tunneling .",
    "we distinguish two main mechanisms of persistent electric doping : ( i ) an even in voltage contribution , attributed to a charge transfer effect , and ( ii ) an odd in voltage contribution , attributed to reordering of oxygen impurities .",

    "ii we make a brief overview of physical doping mechanisms of cuprates .",
    "iii provides experimental details . in sec .",
    "iv we present the main experimental results and in sec .  v we discuss possible mechanisms of persistent electric doping , followed by conclusions .",
    "photo - doping allows a wide - range variation of doping in the same sample @xcite .",
    "the ordinary non - equilibrium photo - doping is quickly relaxing because of a very short life time ( @xmath8ps ) of photoinduced charge carriers @xcite .",
    "however , in underdoped @xmath6 and some other cuprates a different type of persistent photo - doping takes place @xcite .",
    "it involves significant energies @xmath8@xmath9 , which makes it metastable at low temperatures .",
    "several mechanisms are contributing to the persistent photo - doping @xcite , such as charge transfer , which changes the redox state of the impurity atom @xcite , and ordering of oxygen impurities in the lattice @xcite .",
    "photo - doping always leads to an increase of the doping level with respect to the initial state .",
    "electric fields may both increase or decrease the number of mobile charge carriers , depending on the direction of the applied field @xcite .",
    "the ordinary electric field effect is not persistent and exists only during the time an electric field is applied .",

    "this is also a surface phenomenon , but in case of layered cuprates , which represent stacks of metallic cuo planes sandwiched between polar - insulating layers @xcite , electrostatic charging of insulating layers may in principle lead to the _ bulk _ persistent electrostatic field - effect .",
    "another type of a persistent and bulk electric - field effect has been observed at large current densities @xcite .",
    "similar to photo - doping , it was attributed to a charge transfer @xcite and reordering of oxygen impurities @xcite .",
    "significant oxygen mobility in intense electric fields also leads to a resistive switching phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the resistive switching phenomenon occurs in many complex oxides and is the basis for the development of resistive memory devices .",
    "several mechanisms may be involved in the resistive switching phenomenon @xcite , including a change of the redox state of some of the elements , oxygen migration , and filament formation .",
    "resistive switching has been observed on depleted surfaces of bi-2212 cuprates @xcite and attributed to oxygen migration .",

    "mesas were fabricated on top of freshly cleaved bi-2212 single crystals by means of optical lithography , ar ion milling and focused ion beam trimming .",
    "four batches of crystals were used : pure near optimally doped ( op ) bi-2212 , pure strongly underdoped ( ud ) bi-2212 , lead - substituted @xmath11 [ bi(pb)-2212 ] , and yttrium - doped @xmath12 [ bi(y)-2212 ] .",
    "mesas of different sizes from @xmath13 to @xmath14 and with a different number of junctions @xmath15 were studied .",
    "details of the sample fabrication can be found in ref .",
    "all studied mesas exhibited a persistent doping effect upon application of a sufficiently large bias voltage .",
    "the samples were placed in a flowing gas cryostat and measured in a three - probe configuration with a common top gold contact .",
    "the ground contacts for current and voltage were provided through other mesas on the same crystal . a keithley k6221 current source and a fpga - based arbitrary waveform generator and lock - in amplifier were used to bias and measure the samples .",
    "biasing was done at pseudo - constant voltage , with an optional small superimposed ac voltage to simultaneously measure the high - bias differential resistance in addition to the dc resistance .",
    "positive bias is defined as current going into the mesa through the common top contact , as sketched in fig .",

    "from chemical ( oxygen ) doping studies it is known that doping / undoping of bi-2212 is accompanied by a proportional decrease / increase of the @xmath2-axis resistivity @xcite .",

    "the state of the mesa remains stable even at room temperature on the time scale of several days .",

    "[ fig : dynamics](b ) and ( c ) for the same bi(pb)-2212 mesa .",
    "the resistance decreases for positive bias ( electric field into the crystal ) and increases for negative bias ( electric field towards the top contact ) , which indicates that we can controllably and reversibly dope and undope the mesa .",
    "the doping rate and direction depend both on the sign and the absolute value of bias voltage .        figure  [ fig : dynamics](c ) summarizes the bias dependence of the doping rate for the bi(pb)-2212 mesa . below the threshold voltages , @xmath21 ,",
    "the mesa resistance is stable . upon increasing the bias voltage , the resistance of the mesa starts to gradually change at a rate that increases drastically up to @xmath22 as shown in the inset of fig .",

    "the sign change of the alteration rate at high bias is in agreement with the observations by koval _ etal .",
    "the behavior in this regime is , however , history dependent , as may be seen from fig .",

    "the doping process for the bi(pb)-2212 mesa , fig .",

    "it is seen that the resistance is constant at @xmath24 , and starts to increase slowly at 1.9v .",
    "however , at 2v the resistance initially increases but then starts to decrease after a few minutes .",
    "this clearly shows that there are two counteracting processes : a positive rate mechanism that saturates quickly and a mechanism with negative rates that is dominating at longer times and at higher voltages .",

    "the resistance steadily decreases at a rate which is strongly bias dependent , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics](f ) .    figures  [ fig : dynamics](e , f ) show the bias dependence of doping and a history dependence upon sequential voltage sweeps ( e ) .",
    "it is seen that for the op bi-2212 mesa the electric doping is predominantly even in voltage , i.e. , the direction of doping does not depend on the sign of the bias voltage .",

    "2 ( c ) and ( f ) indicates the presence of sub - dominant even- and odd - in - voltage contributions for bi(pb)-2212 and op bi-2212 mesas , respectively .",
    "using the described method , the superconducting properties of the mesas have been altered to different intermediate doping states denoted by a successive number .",
    "the electric doping changes all mesa characteristics : the @xmath2-axis resistivity , the critical temperature @xmath25 , the @xmath2-axis critical current density @xmath26 , the superconducting energy gap , @xmath27 , the @xmath2-axis pseudogap and the @xmath2-axis resistivity in a manner very similar to chemical ( oxygen ) doping @xcite .    figure  [ fig : tdep ]  shows temperature dependencies of low bias ac - resistances for the initial , high resistance state ( hrs ) , and doped , lower resistance states ( lrs ) , for ( a ) an op bi-2212 and ( e , f ) a bi(pb)-2212 mesa .",

    "[ fig : tdep](a ) it is seen that the initial state was characterized by the strong thermal - activation - type increase of resistance with decreasing @xmath20 , typical for underdoped bi-2212 @xcite .",
    "the general shape of the resistive transition was described in ref .",
    "@xcite . at @xmath30",
    "the resistance dropped to the top - contact resistance , which originates from the first deteriorated junction between the top cuo plane , shortly exposed to atmosphere after cleavage , and the second , un - deteriorated cuo plane @xcite .",
    "initially this junction had a very low @xmath31 and a very small critical current , @xmath32 , as can be seen from the corresponding @xmath28-@xmath29 in panel ( d ) .",
    "after electric doping , the resistance in the normal state dropped almost three times and became less semiconducting .",
    "the main @xmath25 of the mesa changed only slightly , indicating that the doping was changing around the optimal doping level with the flat @xmath25 vs. doping dependence .",
    "however , the properties of the top junction changed drastically : the @xmath31 increased to @xmath33 , and the critical current increased ten - fold as shown in panel ( d ) , even though it still remains @xmath34 times smaller than for the rest of the junctions in the mesa , as can be seen from panel ( c ) .",
    "this indicates that the surface cuo plane was initially strongly underdoped and , therefore , responded much stronger to variation of doping , due to the steep @xmath25 vs. doping dependence at the underdoped side of the doping phase diagram of cuprates @xcite .",
    "a similar trend was also observed in photo - doping @xcite .",
    "another possible reason for the stronger response of the underdoped top junction is the larger @xmath2-axis resistivity of underdoped intrinsic josephson junctions @xcite . because of that the electric field is not uniformly distributed along the mesa but is larger in the high - resistive top junction",
    "this together with the strong voltage dependence of the electric doping leads to a faster doping of the top junction and the doping may even go in the opposite direction with respect to the rest of the mesa .",
    "the effect of non - uniform doping along the height of the mesa becomes more pronounced in higher mesas with a larger number of intrinsic josephson junctions .",

    "this is the basis of the its technique , which allows analysis of the superconducting energy gap @xmath27 in the bulk of the bi-2212 single crystal .",

    "this qualitative conclusion is not affected by self - heating because the dissipation power at the kink decreases with decreasing resistance and becomes smaller with subsequent doping .",
    "thus , with over - doping the superconducting sum - gap singularity becomes sharper and moves to lower voltages despite the progressive reduction of self - heating .",

    "the anticorrelation between @xmath42 and @xmath27 in underdoped bi-2212 has been reported before @xcite and was attributed to progressively more incoherent @xmath2-axis transport in combination with the @xmath43-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "so far we were discussing a gradual electric doping of bi-2212 mesas at the time scale of an hour , as shown in fig .",

    "it is well established that the doping state of cuprates depends not only on the amount of off - stoichiometric oxygen , but also on the relative orientation of the oxygen bonds @xcite .",
    "therefore , the doping state can be changed by oxygen reordering .",
    "since the required energy is large @xmath8@xmath75 , compared to thermal energies , oxygen reordering is a slow process and does not take place spontaneously at low enough @xmath20 .",
    "oxygen reordering is considered as one of the main mechanisms of the persistent photo @xcite and electric field @xcite doping .    in the case of persistent electric - field doping , the oxygen reordering is steered by the polarization .",
    "therefore , the direction of doping should depend on the direction of the electric field , i.e. , should be odd with respect to the bias voltage .",
    "we clearly see such a contribution in our experiment , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics](b ) .",
    "note that the odd - in - voltage contribution was reported in the point - contact case @xcite , but not reported in previous related works made on zig - zag type bi-2212 microstructures @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the latter samples is symmetric with respect to the electric field direction ( changing the sign of the electric field is equivalent to flipping their sample up - side down ) .",
    "this is not the case in point contacts and mesa structures , studied here , for which the fields down ( into the crystal ) and up ( into the top electrode ) are not equivalent .",
    "therefore , the difference may partly be due to the difference in sample geometry , or to the observed sample - dependence of the relative strength of odd and even in voltage doping contributions , as shown in figs . 1 ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "thus , we attribute the odd in voltage persistent electric doping mechanism to field - induced oxygen reorientation / reordering .",
    "an increase of the bias voltage above @xmath76 leads to a gradual increase of the current and irreversible change of the mesa properties .",
    "a similar phenomenon was observed in @xmath6 thin films and attributed to electromigration and field - induced diffusion of oxygen , which is even in bias voltage .",
    "the increase of conductance is probably due to a dielectric breakthrough in the insulating bio layers , which leads to a pin - hole and filament formation .",
    "thus , we attribute the slow and irreversible drift of the mesa characteristics at large bias voltages to electromigration in the mesas .",
    "this destructive process is , however , distinctly different from the reversible and reproducible electric doping effect , reported above .",
    "after deterioration by electromigration , the mesa characteristics become similar to resistive switching characteristics for point contacts on top of oxygen - depleted , bi-2212 surfaces @xcite . at even higher bias",
    "the resistance becomes very high ( infinite ) .",
    "but an inspection in a microscope shows that the mesa itself remains intact .",
    "there is no physical evaporation of material or a crater at the place of the mesa , as in the case of a violent electric discharge .",
    "instead there are clear indications of an arc formation at one of the sharp corners of the mesa , which probably leads to delamination of the structure and mechanical disattachment of the mesa from the base crystal .",
    "the most puzzling property of the reported persistent electric doping is that the required bias voltage is weakly dependent on the number of junctions in the mesa @xcite .",
    "this is clearly seen from the presented data , for which the threshold voltage is always @xmath77 for @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ ivsma1b ] , @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics](f ) and @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics](d ) , which is also similar to that for a single point - contact @xmath81",
    "it is , therefore , clear that electric doping requires a certain electron energy , rather than electric field .",
    "however , for stacked tunnel junctions , the energy acquired by the injected electron in every tunneling event is proportional to the voltage drop across the junction , @xmath82 , and is significantly smaller than the threshold energy .",
    "the main question is , therefore , how the electrons accumulate a sufficiently large energy , required for doping .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that an electron can accumulate energy upon sequential tunneling through several junctions without relaxation .",
    "however , in this case only electrons in the last junction will have enough energy .",
    "this would result in a strongly inhomogeneous doping in different junctions .",
    "moreover , the probability of sequential tunneling without relaxation is small , because of the small ratio of relaxation time ( @xmath83 ) @xcite to the tunnel time , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "the probability of sequential tunneling through @xmath86 junctions is decreasing rapidly @xmath87 with increasing @xmath86 .",
    "this should lead to a dramatic increase of the doping time with increasing @xmath86 . indeed , suppose that it takes @xmath88 for @xmath86 junctions at @xmath89 to dope the mesa .",
    "this will involve @xmath90 tunneling events in each junction ( @xmath91 is the electron charge ) .",
    "since the probability of sequential tunneling through @xmath92 junctions is decreasing quadratically , it would require @xmath93 tunneling events per junction , which will take @xmath94 .",
    "however , such a dramatic increase of the doping time with increasing mesa height is inconsistent with experiments .    for the sequential tunneling scenario to be relevant",
    ", the ratio @xmath95 should rapidly drop with increasing electron energy and become of the order of unity at @xmath96 .",
    "this may be caused by resonant tunneling , which increases the tunneling rate of quasiparticles with a certain energy , and/or by a drastic slowing down of the high energy quasiparticle relaxation , which may be caused by a rapid decrease of the eliashberg s electron - boson spectral function and a gap in the corresponding bosonic density of states at high energies @xcite .",
    "such a scenario is interesting to investigate because it may give an information about the bosonic spectrum , involved in cooper pairing , and thus provide a clue about the electron - boson coupling mechanism , responsible for high-@xmath25 superconductivity in cuprates @xcite .",
    "we also want to propose an alternative mechanism for the energy accumulation of electrons : the formation of electric - field domains in the natural atomic superlattice formed by the mesa .",
    "electric field domains are well studied in semiconducting superlattices @xcite .",
    "they appear in weakly coupled superlattices close to the resonant tunneling condition .",
    "the corresponding non - linearity leads to an instability and a multiple - valued current - voltage characteristics . as a result ,",
    "the electric field distribution in the superlattice becomes nonuniform and is concentrated in one or several junctions .",
    "a possibility of a formation of electric field domains in bi-2212 mesas is not just a hypothesis .",
    "in fact , the multiple - branch @xmath28-@xmath29 of bi-2212 mesas due to one - by - one switching of intrinsic junctions from the superconducting to the resistive state , shown in fig .",
    "[ ivsma1b](b ) , is due to a formation of electric field domains in individual tunnel junctions .",
    "the formation of electric field domains in bi-2212 mesas at high bias would explain many of the features of the studied persistent electric doping",
    ". in this case electrons in the domain may gain an energy close to ev without sequential tunneling through the whole mesa .",
    "furthermore , since domains are typically dynamic and propagate through the whole superlattice @xcite , this would also explain the uniformity of doping in the whole mesa , and not just in the outermost junction .",
    "we have studied the effect of persistent electric doping on intrinsic tunneling characteristics of small bi-2212 mesa structures .",
    "it was shown that the application of a sufficiently large voltage to the mesas leads to a controllable and reversible physical doping of the mesas , without a modification of their chemical composition .",
    "this allows the analysis of bulk electronic spectra in bi-2212 in a wide doping range on one and the same mesa .",
    "this physical doping has the same effect as chemical ( oxygen ) doping on the intrinsic tunneling characteristics of bi-2212 : the @xmath2-axis resistivity decreases , the critical current increases and the energy gap is decreasing together with @xmath97 with over - doping .",
    "the anticorrelation between @xmath42 and @xmath27 indicates that the @xmath2-axis transport becomes progressively more incoherent at the underdoped side of the phase diagram .",
    "an analysis of the doping variation of the intrinsic tunneling characteristics of the same mesa provides a clue about its genuine shape : with subsequent doping , the sum - gap peak in the tunneling conductance becomes sharper and the pseudogap hump rapidly decreases with doping , suggesting the presence of a critical doping point , in agreement with previous chemical doping studies @xcite .    by analyzing the bias- and time dependence",
    "we could identify different mechanisms involved in the persistent electric doping : i ) the even - in - voltage process via charge transfer and/or charge trapping .",
    "ii ) the odd - in - voltage process via oxygen reordering . those are distinct from the irreversible electromigration and oxygen electrodiffusion , observed at higher bias .",
    "we confirm the previous report @xcite that the threshold voltage for the electric doping is weakly dependent of the number of junctions in the mesas and is similar to that for a single surface point contact @xcite .",
    "this indicates that it is the energy of injected electrons , rather than electric field , that determines the phenomenon .",
    "we suggest that the required energy accumulation by tunnel electrons may be due to a formation of electric field domains in the natural atomic superlattice formed in the bi-2212 single crystal .",
