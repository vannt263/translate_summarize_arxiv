    "recent observations of unevolved halo stars have confirmed the surprising linear relationship of the be and b abundances with [ fe / h ] ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this primary behaviour of be and b can not be understood on the basis of the standard model ( sm ) of libeb production in the interstellar medium ( ism ) from gcr spallation .",
    "this is because in the sm the libeb production rates are proportional to the global metallicity of the ism , so that a secondary behaviour with [ fe / h ] is expected .",
    "however , the sm assumes a _ gcr flux constant in time _ and equal to that currently oberved at the earth .",
    "there are many reasons to believe that the gcr flux was different in early epochs . in this contribution we solve the time - dependent propagation equation of crs in the galaxy in a simple and parametrized way to test whether the sm can be compatible with observations when the hypothesis of the cr flux constancy in time is relaxed .",
    "we consider a general time - dependent equation for the gcr propagation : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number density of gcr particles per energy interval as a function of energy per nucleon and time , @xmath2 is the loss time - scale including escape , @xmath3 , and inelastic nuclear interaction , @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 represents the ionization energy losses in the ism and finally , @xmath6 is the source spectrum of gcrs .",
    "we make the following assumptions :    \\1 ) the energy and time dependences of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are separable : @xmath10 2 ) we assume that gcrs are produced by supernovae ( sn ) so that @xmath11 , the sn rate , taken from a chemical evolution model which reproduces the current sn rates in the galaxy and the main characteristics of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the source energy spectrum is : @xmath12^{1.5}}\\ ] ] with @xmath13 mev .",
    "the constant @xmath14 is chosen in such a way that we can reproduce the observed current gcr flux at the earth .",
    "\\3 ) @xmath2 can be split into two parts @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the escape time - scale from the galaxy , and @xmath17 is the loss time - scale against inelastic nuclear interaction .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath16 is taken from @xcite and that of @xmath17 from @xcite assuming a gas density of 1 @xmath18 .",
    "\\4 ) the energy losses due to ionization in the ism have been considered according to @xcite .",
    "\\5 ) the time - dependence of the ionization losses and of the inelastic nuclear interactions can be plausibly caused by temporal changes in the gas density .",
    "the time - dependence of the escape time - scale is more difficult to understand . here",
    "we treat it as a free parameter . for both we assume , for the sake of simplicity , exponential functions",
    ": @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the characteristic e - folding time of gas exhaustion in the galaxy and @xmath21 is the characteristic time - scale for variations of @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 was higher in the past , during the halo collapse ( t@xmath22 gyr ) .",
    "eq . ( 1 ) can be solved using the method of characteristics .",
    "the solution can be simplified considerably if @xmath23 yr .",
    "plausible values for @xmath20 and @xmath21 are longer than @xmath24 yr , so in that case the solution is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ionization energy loss time - scale calculated as : @xmath27 then , the rate of accumulation of libeb in the ism is calculated in the usual way ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have considered the following cases :    * case 1 : * the energy dependence of the gcr source spectrum is given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) with @xmath28 equal to the sn rate evolution .",
    "the remaining parameters are constant in time",
    ".    * case 2 : * case 1 plus @xmath29 from eq .",
    "( 5 ) with @xmath30 gyr during the first 2 gyr of galactic evolution and @xmath31 afterwards ( i.e no time variation of @xmath32 ) .",
    "this means that the cr escape time - scale at @xmath33 was a factor @xmath34 higher than now .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the calculated time - dependent gcr fluxes as well as the corresponding libeb evolution with [ fe / h ] .",
    "the results are :    * case 1 : * the flux is _ higher in the past _ and decreases slowly with time in the whole energy range .",
    "this higher flux implies a larger libeb production in the past than the sm model , although , this is still not enough to reproduce the observations .    * case 2 : * the flux in the past is _ also higher and the spectrum is flatter at energies e@xmath35 _ mev",
    "/ n . in consequence",
    "the libeb production is even higher at early epochs than in _ case 1_. note that the predicted be evolution is nearly in agreement with the observations .",
    "on the other hand , the effect of considering the temporal evolution of the gas content in the galaxy is not very important for the libeb production . in this case",
    "the flux and spectrum are modified in a complex way depending on the value of @xmath20 and the interplay between @xmath36 and @xmath17 .",
    "our results show that variations of the gcr flux in time have to be considered to study the early production of libeb by spallation in the ism .",
    "a higher flux and a flatter cr spectrum in the past are able to improve the agreement between the predictions of the ( modified ) sm with observations .",
    "this is evident for be and b. for li , however , another important source of production is still required .",
    "a higher flux in the past can be achieved by taking into account the temporal evolution of the gcr sources , which is naturally explained by the temporal variation of the sn rate , or by assuming that the escape time - scale @xmath37 was higher in the past .",
    "the later assumption can improve the agreement between data and model considerably .",
    "however , it still requires a more solid theoretical justification ( @xcite ) .",
