    "it is well known that when the medium surrounding the copolymer is made of two solvents , separated for example by an interface , and the solvents interact with the monomers according to the value of the charge , the typical behavior of the copolymer may differ substantially from the case in which the medium is homogeneous . on copolymers",

    "moreover , for a realistic model of the interface , one should consider the possibility of the presence of impurities or fluctuations in the interface layer , as in @xcite . as an extreme , but very important example , one could consider also the case in which the interactions at the interface are essentially the only relevant ones , see @xcite .    in order to be more concrete ,",

    "a complete treatment of slowly varying functions is found in @xcite , but these functions are needed for us to in order to work in a reasonably general and well defined set  up : we will use no fine property of slowly varying function since in most of the cases rough bounds on @xmath90 will suffice .",
    "[ rem : s ] in short , one may think of building @xmath36 by first assigning the return times to zero according to a renewal process .",

    "the last property in the list above , the renewal property of @xmath36 , makes a bit more precise what the excursions of the process really are : this property is very useful to have a nice pictorial vision of the process , but it is rather inessential for us .",
    "we will use it only in stating theorem  [ th : correlazioni ] since this way it turns out to be somewhat nicer and more intuitive , but the essence of our analysis lies in @xmath48 .",
    "note also that if @xmath92 the energy does not depend on @xmath91 . in this case",
    "we are dealing with a pure pinning model and insisting on @xmath36 taking values in @xmath93 is a useless limitation .",
    "[ rem : s1 ] we have chosen @xmath29 to be a recurrent state of @xmath36 because it simplifies a little the notations , but everything carries over to the case in which @xmath29 is transient .",

    "we make the very same assumptions on @xmath96 and , in addition , @xmath97 and @xmath96 are independent .",
    "the law of @xmath25 will be denoted by @xmath26 , and the corresponding expectation by @xmath98 .",
    "a further assumption on @xmath25 is the following _ concentration inequality _ : there exists a positive constant @xmath99 such that for every @xmath28 , for every lipschitz and convex function @xmath100 with @xmath101 and for @xmath102 @xmath103\\big\\vert \\ge t\\right )   \\ , \\le \\ ,   c \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{t^2}{c \\vert g \\vert ^2 _ { \\rm lip}}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the lipschitz constant of @xmath105 with respect to the euclidean distance on @xmath106 .    of course such",

    "the concentration inequality is known to hold with a certain generality : its validity for the gaussian case and for the case of bounded random variables is by now a classical result ( @xcite ) .",
    "while of course such an inequality requires @xmath116 < \\infty$ ] for some @xmath117 , a complete characterization of the distributions for which holds is , to our knowledge , still lacking , but among these distributions there are , for example , the cases in which the laws of @xmath107 and @xmath118 satisfy the log  sobolev inequality , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , therefore , in particular , whenever @xmath107 and @xmath118 are continuous variables with positive densities of the form @xmath119 , with @xmath120 and @xmath121 when restricted to @xmath122 , for some @xmath123 .",
    "we have chosen to work assuming concentration because it provides a unified rather general framework in which proofs are at several instances much shorter ( and , possibly , more transparent ) . however , as it will be clear , several results hold under weaker assumptions . on the other hand",
    "we deal only with the polymer pinned at the endpoint , that is , constrained to @xmath124 : we have chosen this case for the sake of conciseness , but we could have decided for example to leave the endpoint free .      under the above assumptions on the disorder the _ quenched free energy _ of the system exists ,",
    "namely the limit @xmath125 exists @xmath126almost surely and in the @xmath127 sense .",
    "the existence of this limit can be proven via standard super  additivity arguments ( we refer for example to @xcite for details ) .",
    "we stress that the concentration inequality implies immediately that @xmath128 is not random , but such a result may be proven under much weaker assumptions , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a simple but fundamental observation is that @xmath129 the proof of this is elementary : if we set @xmath130 for @xmath131 and @xmath132 we have @xmath133 \\\\ = \\ , \\frac { \\lambda}n {   \\sum_{n=1}^n \\left({{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb e } } } \\left[{\\omega}_1 \\right]+h\\right ) }    + \\frac { { \\widetilde}{\\lambda}}n \\left ( { { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb e } } } \\left[{\\widetilde}{\\omega}_n \\right ] + { \\widetilde}h \\right ) + \\frac 1n   \\log { { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf p } } } \\left ( { \\omega}_n^+\\right)\\ , \\stackrel{n \\to \\infty}{\\longrightarrow}\\ , { \\lambda}h,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we have applied the fact that , by , @xmath134 , for @xmath135 .",

    "we observe that @xmath139 where @xmath140 of course the normalization constant @xmath141,\\ ] ] changes , but @xmath142 so that the @xmath126a.s . and @xmath143 asymptotic behavior of @xmath144 are given by @xmath145 .",
    "we will always work with @xmath146 , in order to conform with most of the previous mathematical literature .",
    "for the model we introduced there is a very vast literature , mostly in chemistry , physics and bio  physics .",
    "it often goes under the name of _ copolymer with adsorption _ , see e.g. @xcite and references therein , and such a name clearly reflects the superposition of two distinct polymer  environment interactions :    * the monomer  solvent interaction , associated to the charges @xmath94 .",
    "some monomers prefer one solvent and some prefer the other one . since the charges are placed in an inhomogeneous way along the chain , energetically favored trajectories need to stick close to the interface . whether pinning actually takes place or not depends on the interplay between energetic gain and entropic loss associated to localization ( trajectories that stay close to the interface have a much smaller entropy than those which wander away ) .",
    "+ if @xmath147 and @xmath148 only this interaction is present and we will call the model simply _ copolymer_. * the monomer  interface interaction , associated to @xmath96 .",
    "this interaction leads to a pinning ( or depinning ) phenomenon with a more direct mechanism : trajectories are energetically favored if they touch the interface _ as often as possible _ at points where @xmath149 , avoiding at the same time the points in which @xmath150 .",
    "also in this case , a non  trivial energy / entropy competition is responsible for the localization / delocalization transition .",
    "+ when @xmath92 and @xmath151 we will refer to the model as _ pinning _ model .",
    "the copolymer model has received a lot of attention : we mention in particular @xcite , in which it was first introduced and the replica method was applied in order to investigate the transition .",
    "rigorous work started with @xcite , followed by @xcite : these works deal with the case @xmath152 and @xmath107 symmetric and taking only the values @xmath27 ( _ binary charges _ ) .",
    "it turns out that in such a case there is no transition and the model is localized for every @xmath147 .    in general",
    ", one may distinguish between results concerning the free energy and results on pathwise behavior of the polymer .",
    "about the first point , we mention that in @xcite the model with @xmath153 has been considered , still with the choice of binary charges , and the existence of a transition has been established , along with estimates on the critical curve and remarkable limiting properties of the free energy of the model in the limit of weak coupling ( @xmath15 small ) . improved estimates on free energy and critical curve",
    "may be found in @xcite . in the physical literature one can find a number of conjectures , mostly on the free energy behavior , that are far from clarifying the phase diagram . in this respect , it is interesting to mention that recent numerical simulations ( @xcite ) show that the critical line is different from that predicted in the theoretical physics literature , which means that the localization mechanism is still poorly understood .",
    "disordered pinning has been extensively studied in the physical literature , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite for more recent references ) , but much less in the mathematical one . however",
    "the model has started attracting attention lately , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we should stress that there is no agreement in the physical literature on several important issues for disordered pinning .",
    "for instance , it is still unclear whether the critical curve coincides with the so  called annealed curve .    about the study of path behavior",
    ", there is a basic difference between the localized and the delocalized phase : in the first case , since @xmath154 , the interaction produces an exponential modification of the free polymer measure , and therefore _ large deviation",
    "_ techniques apply very naturally .",
    "the path behavior of the copolymer model in the localized phase has been considered in @xcite , for @xmath152 and binary charges , while in @xcite also the case @xmath155 is taken into account .",
    "in @xcite the focus is on the gibbsian characterization of the infinite volume polymer measure ( in the localized phase ) .",
    "the delocalized phase is more subtle , due to the fact that @xmath156 , and path delocalization estimates involve estimates on _ moderate deviations _ of the free energy .",
    "results on the path behavior in the delocalized phase have been obtained only recently in @xcite , both for the copolymer and for the disordered pinning model .",
    "in the present work , we consider the localized phase of the general model defined in section  [ sec : model ] and formula . in addition to giving new results , our approach provides also a setting to reinterpret in a simpler way known results for copolymer and pinning models .",
    "the free energy is everywhere continuous and almost everywhere differentiable , by convexity , so in particular @xmath157 is an open set .",
    "however , one can go much beyond that , as our first theorem shows :    [ th : cinf ] @xmath158 is infinitely differentiable in @xmath157 .",
    "an interesting problem is to study the regularity properties of @xmath159 at the boundary between @xmath157 and @xmath160 , where it is non  analytic .",
    "this corresponds to investigating the order of the localization / delocalization transition .",
    "recently , an important step in this direction was performed in @xcite and @xcite where it was proved , in particular , that the first derivatives of @xmath159 are continuous on the boundary . in other words ,",
    "the ( de)localization transition is at least of second order .",
    "as it will become clear in section [ sec : reg ] , the smoothness of the free energy in @xmath161 boils down to a property of exponential decay of ( average ) correlations . for this implication",
    "we essentially rely on @xcite , where a similar result has been proven in the context of disordered ising models .",
