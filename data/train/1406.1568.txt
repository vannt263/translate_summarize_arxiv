    "analysis of data collected from multiple species presents challenges because of the intrinsic correlation produced by the shared evolutionary history .",
    "this dependency structure can be modeled by assuming that the traits of interest evolved along a phylogeny according to a stochastic process .",
    "two commonly used processes for continuous traits , such as body mass , are brownian motion ( bm ) and the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process .",
    "bm is used to model neutral evolution , with no favored direction ( see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the ou process can account for natural selection using two extra parameters : a `` selection optimum '' @xmath3 towards which the process is attracted and a `` selection strength '' @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the ou process has a stationary distribution , which is gaussian with mean @xmath3 and variance @xmath5 .",
    "the presence of natural selection can be detected by testing whether @xmath6 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "changes in @xmath3 across different groups of organisms are used to correlate changes in selection regime with changes in behavior or environmental conditions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the optimal body size @xmath3 might be different for terrestrial animals than for birds and bats . in practice , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the infinitesimal variance @xmath7 ( or stationary variance @xmath8 )",
    "are estimated from data on extant species .",
    "in other words , only data at the tips of the tree are available .",
    "the process at internal nodes and edges is unobserved .",
    "also , the tree is reconstructed independently from external and abundant data , typically from dna sequences . in practice",
    "there can be some uncertainty about a few nodes in the tree , but we assume here that the tree is known without error .    the ou process on a tree has been used extensively in practice ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but very few authors have studied convergence rates of available estimators . recently ho and an @xcite showed that if the tree height is bounded as the sample size goes to infinity , no estimator for @xmath3 can ever be consistent . this is because @xmath3 is not  microergodic \" : the distribution @xmath9 of the whole observable process @xmath10 at the tips of the tree is such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not orthogonal for any values @xmath13 , if the tree height is bounded .",
    "this boundedness assumption does not hold for common models of evolutionary trees however , such as the pure - birth ( yule ) process @xcite .",
    "we consider here the case of an unbounded tree height .",
    "we study the consistency and convergence rates of several estimators , including some novel estimators , using tools from the literature on the reconstruction problem in probability theory .",
    "in particular we relate the convergence rates of these estimators to the growth rate of the phylogeny .",
    "this connection is natural given that the growth rate ( and the related branching number ) is known to play an important role in the analysis of a variety of stochastic processes including random walks , percolation and ancestral state reconstruction on trees  @xcite .",
    "in particular we leverage a useful characterization of the variance of linear estimators in terms of electrical networks .    [ [ main - results ] ] main results + + + + + + + + + + + +    we present the asymptotic properties of two common estimators for @xmath3 : the sample mean and the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) .",

    "( the assumption of known @xmath4 is proved not to be restrictive for our convergence rate results if @xmath4 can be well estimated . ) in fact , we give an example when @xmath14 performs significantly better than the sample mean , which is not consistent in that particular case . in one of our main results , we identify a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of @xmath14 .",
    "we also derive a phase transition on its convergence rate , which drops from @xmath0-consistency ( i.e. the variance is @xmath15 ) to a lower rate , @xmath2 being the number of samples ( i.e. tip observations ) .",
    "this phase transition depends on the growth rate of the tree .",
    "tree growth measures the rate at which new leaves arise as the tree height increases ( see section [ sec : def ] for a formal definition ) .",
    "roughly , when the growth rate is below @xmath16 , we show that @xmath0-consistency holds .",
    "this is intuitive as a lower growth rate means lower correlations between the leaf states . on the other hand ,",
    "when the growth rate is above @xmath16 implying a sample size @xmath17 , i.e. when the tree is sufficiently `` bushy , '' then the  effective sample size \" is reduced to @xmath18 and the @xmath19-consistency of @xmath14 is lost .",
    "we also provide novel , efficient estimators for the other two parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath8 , which achieve @xmath0-consistency and do not require the knowledge of @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath0-consistency in this case is not affected by growth rate , unlike the case of the mle for @xmath3 .",
    "our results lead to a practical method to assess whether additional species are informative or not , thus helping researchers to avoid wasting money and effort .",
    "section  [ sec : app ] presents simulations to illustrate these suggestions .",
    "our main results are stated formally and further discussed in section [ sec : def ] , after necessary definitions .",

    "[ [ related - work ] ] related work + + + + + + + + + + + +    bartoszek and sagitov @xcite obtained a corresponding phase transition for the convergence rate of the sample mean to estimate @xmath3 , assuming a yule process for the tree .",
    "phase transitions for the convergence rate of some u - statistics have also been obtained for the ou model when the tree follows a supercritical branching process @xcite .",
    "a main difference between these studies and our work is that we assume that the tree is known . even though tree - free estimators are the only practical options when the tree is unknown , this situation is now becoming rare due to the ever - growing availability of sequence data for building trees .",
    "for instance crawford and suchard @xcite acknowledge that `` as evolutionary biologists further refine our knowledge of the tree of life , the number of clades whose phylogeny is truly unknown may diminish , along with interest in tree - free estimation methods . ''    as we mentioned , related phase transitions have been obtained for other processes on trees . for instance , the growth rate of the tree determines whether the state at the root can be reconstructed better than random for a binary symmetric channel on a binary tree ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in a recent result , mossel and steel  @xcite established a transition for ancestral state reconstruction by majority rule for the binary symmetric model on a yule tree at the same critical point as above .",
    "note that majority rule is a tree - free estimator like the sample mean in @xcite , but adapted to discrete traits . in the context of the ou model , mossel et al .",

    "<S> diffusion processes on trees are commonly used in evolutionary biology to model the joint distribution of continuous traits , such as body mass , across species . estimating the parameters of such processes from tip values presents challenges because of the intrinsic correlation between the observations produced by the shared evolutionary history , thus violating the standard independence assumption of large - sample theory . </S>",
    "<S> for instance ho and an @xcite recently proved that the mean ( also known in this context as selection optimum ) of an ornstein - uhlenbeck process on a tree can not be estimated consistently from an increasing number of tip observations if the tree height is bounded . here , using a fruitful connection to the so - called reconstruction problem in probability theory , we study the convergence rate of parameter estimation in the unbounded height case . for the mean of the process , we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) and establish a phase transition on its convergence rate in terms of the growth of the tree . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we show that a loss of @xmath0-consistency ( i.e. , the variance of the mle becomes @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of tips ) occurs when the tree growth is larger than a threshold related to the phase transition of the reconstruction problem . for the covariance parameters , we give a novel , efficient estimation method which achieves @xmath0-consistency under natural assumptions on the tree . </S>",
