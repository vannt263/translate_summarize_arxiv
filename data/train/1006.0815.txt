    "the _ recycling scenario _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) provides an evolutionary link between the young slowly rotating pulsars and the old fast millisecond pulsars .",
    "the evolutionary phase during which the pulsar is spun up happens when a neutron star in a binary accretes gas stripped from the donor companion .",
    "the gas is channeled onto the magnetic poles producing x - ray pulses modulated at the rotational frequency of the neutron star .",
    "when the accreting pulsar starts to spin in the millisecond range it is called an accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar ( amxp ) .    to establish the presence of a spin up process it is crucial the measurement of torques . according to accretion theory , the excess angular momentum brought by the accreting gas is responsible for the acceleration of the neutron star rotation .",
    "however , if the angular momentum of the gas is not sufficiently high , the neutron star can be spun down during accretion ( propeller regime , see the seminal works of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a recent study ) .",
    "the magnitude of the spin up / down is correlated with the amount of accreted matter , and hence with the x - ray flux . in the past",
    ", several attempts have been made to measure a spin up / down in several amxps , and a wealth of measurements are now available for at least eleven out of the thirteen known amxps ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . to accomplish this ,",
    "the x - ray pulse phases are measured and a timing model is fitted to represent the orbital motion , the spin frequency and its first time derivative . in this model",
    "one makes the assumption that the rotational parameters of the neutron star ( spin frequency and its derivatives ) are coincident with the observed pulse frequency and time derivatives ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , large deviations from this model are usually seen in the timing residuals .",
    "these deviations , referred to as x - ray timing noise , represent some unmodeled component in the pulse phases which has not yet a conclusive explanation .",
    "recently , it has been shown that timing noise in at least 6 amxps is strongly correlated with the x - ray flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "the major conclusion was that it is the pulse phase rather than its second time derivative ( i.e. , the pulse frequency derivative ) to be correlated with the x - ray flux , contrary to what predicted by accretion theory .",
    "a similar problem for accretion theory was seen in xte j1807 - 204 @xcite , in which the pulse frequency derivative has no correlation with the x - ray flux whereas the pulse phases are strongly correlated at all timescales with the x - ray flux .",
    "this is particularly convincing given the presence of large fluctuations in the x - ray flux at different timescales .",
    "the first claim for a detection of an accretion torque in an amxp was made by @xcite for the amxp igr j00291 + 5934 ( henceforth referred to as igr j00291 ) during the first outburst extensively observed by rxte / pca and integral in 2004 .",
    "differently from many other amxps , the timing residuals of igr j00291 look quite smooth , and the presence of timing noise is not as dramatic as in other amxps  @xcite . therefore at a first sight , it looks quite obvious to look for the presence of a spin up which manifests as a parabolic trend in the pulse phases and can be measured according to standard coherent timing techniques . however , also the 2004 x - ray flux of igr j00291 shows a smooth decay in time , and no sudden flux variations are observed . therefore if a correlation between the x - ray flux and the pulse phases is present , it is difficult to disentangle it from a parabolic variation due to a true spin up , which is expected to be uncorrelated with the x - ray flux variations .",
    "@xcite studied the 2004 outburst of igr j00291 and claimed that already during this outburst there is a possible correlation between flux and pulse phases as those seen in other amxps .",
    "indeed , these authors questioned the presence of a torque _ as strong as _ that detected by @xcite , although they did not quantify the magnitude of the expected torque in igr j00291 .    in 2008",
    "the amxp igr j00291 went in outburst again @xcite .",
    "this outburst was quite anomalous with respect to the previous one observed in 2004 , since it showed first a faint outburst with a peak flux of about half the value of the 2004 , and then went into a very low flux level phase for more than 30 days . during this low level activity phase ,",
    "the source was not detected by rxte and was marginally detected by xmm - newton @xcite .",
    "after this period , a new high level activity episode was recorded : the flux slowly rose for about 6 days , before decaying again and entering into quiescence on a timescale of approximately one week from the outburst peak .",
    "the 2008 outburst has shown therefore strong flux variations that might be correlated with the pulse phases .",
    "the behavior of the 2008 outburst is also very attractive for the purpose of testing accretion theory and pulsars evolution .",
    "thanks to the long baseline of the observations , it is possible to follow the evolution of the spin parameters in igr j00291 on a timescale of 4 years . only for two other amxps",
    "it has been possible to accomplish this : sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and swift j1756 - 2508 @xcite .",
    "the spin of these sources is consistent with very weak or no accretion torques during the outbursts , and with a spin down during quiescence that can be interpreted as a magneto dipole torque like that operating in radio millisecond pulsars .",
    "the plan of the paper goes as follows . in section  [ redu ]",
    "i give a detailed summary of the observations used and explain the methodology applied to analyze the pulse phases and the x - ray flux .    in section  [ sca ]",
    "i perform a detailed standard coherent analysis of the pulse phases of igr j00291 .",
    "the assumption made in this section is that accretion theory provides a good description of the behavior of pulse phases and consequently of the neutron star spin parameters , even if timing noise is present .",
    "this analysis is made to verify whether the minimal assumptions made in accretion theory are sufficient to provide a satisfactory explanation of the pulse phase behavior .",
    "i discuss inconsistencies in the results obtained with this methodology .",
    "in section  [ cca ] i study the correlations between x - ray flux and pulse phase variations .",
    "i propose an extended version of the method first appeared in @xcite to measure the spin frequency and accretion torques under the assumption that x - ray flux variations _ have an effect _ on pulse phases .",
    "i call this method correlation coherent analysis , as opposed to the standard coherent analysis ( see sections  [ scam ] and  [ ccam ] ) . with this method",
    "i am able to remove the effects of the x - ray flux variations from the pulse phases and measure `` cleaned '' spin parameters .    in section  [ disc ]",
    "i discuss the implication of the measurement of the spin period of igr j00291 .",
    "i first discuss the behavior of the pulsar spin during quiescence ( sec .",
    "[ spin - down ] ) and then i consider the detection of a spin - up during the 2004 outburst ( sec .",
    "[ sat ] ) .",
    "a discussion on the origin of x - ray flux and pulse phase correlations is discussed in section  [ mot ] , where i suggest a possible connection of the pulse phase variations with a hot spot moving on the neutron star surface .",
    "the spin - up timescale of igr j00291 and the consequences on the lack of detected sub millisecond pulsars and the spin distribution of accreting pulsars are discussed in sections  [ equ ] .",
    "finally , the implications of the observed spin evolution are summarized in the framework of the _ recycling scenario _ ( section  [ recy ] ) .",
    "i use all _ rxte _ pca public data for the 2004 and 2008 outbursts of igr j00291 ( table  [ obsid ] ) .",
    "i refer to @xcite for pca characteristics and _ rxte _ pca absolute timing .",
    "i used all available event 125 @xmath3s and good - xenon datas and good - xenon data , since a rigid shift of @xmath4 s is present in the 2004 data due to a bug in an early version of the ftool xenon2fits ( markwardt private communication ) ] , rebinned to 1/8192 s and in the 537 absolute channel that maximizes signal - to - noise - ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "the absolute channels correspond to @xmath5 kev .",
    "the time of arrivals are corrected to the solar system barycenter ( tdb timescale ) by using the best available astrometric position reported in @xcite .",
    "an optical position has also been reported by @xcite which differs by 0.25 arcsec from the determination of @xcite .",
    "if the optical position is used , then a shift in pulse frequency and frequency derivative of @xmath6 hz and @xmath7 hz / s is expected ( see for example eq . a1 and a2 in @xcite ) .",
    "these shifts are small enough to not affect the results reported in the paper .",
    "the light curve is folded in data chunks of different length , between @xmath8 and @xmath9 seconds , keeping only those with s / n@xmath1033.3@xmath11 , giving @xmath121 false pulse detection per source .",
    "the presence of v709 cas in the field of view of igr j00291 has no effect on the determination of the pulse phases . indeed , using the harmonic decomposition  @xcite , only the pulse phases at the very frequency of igr j00291 are measured .",
    "the pulse amplitudes are instead strongly affected by the presence of v709 cas , whereas the contamination cancels out when calculating the ratio between the amplitudes and the @xmath13 error .",
    "i detect only a significant number of pulsations at the fundamental frequency ( @xmath14 ) and then fitted the phases with a keplerian orbit plus a linear and possibly a parabolic term representing @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see section  [ scam ] and  [ ccam ] for more details ) .",
    "i constructed the x - ray light curve using the counts in pca absolute channels 5 - 37 ( @xmath5 kev ) . the background contribution ( calculated with the ftool _ pcabackest _ )",
    "is subtracted from the total counts .    ._rxte",
    "_ observations for the 2004 and 2008 outburst [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + [ tabspin ]    several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the lack of sub - millisecond pulsars , but what appears certainly true is that these spin frequencies are not limited by the break - up frequency of neutron stars , which sets in when the centrifugal force exceeds the gravitational pull .",
    "the break - up frequency depends on the equation of state of ultra - dense matter , and its determination is therefore of fundamental importance to understand the ground state of matter  @xcite .",
    "basically all equation of states allow a much higher break - up frequency than 730 hz .",
    "alternative models to explain the lack of sub - millisecond accreting neutron stars have been proposed , including loss of angular momentum due to emission of gravitational radiation and the existence of magnetic spin equilibrium .    in the former case ,",
    "a train of gravitational waves is emitted as soon as the neutron star develops a significant quadrupole moment .",
    "the angular momentum brought away by the gravitational waves slows down the pulsar rotational period , thus preventing accreting neutron stars to reach sub - millisecond periods .",
    "the gravitational wave torque is proportional to @xmath16 , so its effect greatly increases at high rotational frequencies .",
    "this can produce the sharp cutoff in the spin distribution ( see  @xcite for further discussions of the problem ) .",
    "a loss of angular momentum via gravitational radiation is still an open possibility , but the good agreement between the magnetic field determination via accretion torques and via magneto dipole spin down seems to suggest a simpler ( and in this sense more likely ) explanation for the existence of a 730 hz cutoff .",
    "if the timescale for the spin - up in igr j00291 is of the order of @xmath17 gyr ( see section  [ sat ] ) , then a plausible explanation for the 730 hz cutoff is that accreting neutron stars reach the spin equilibrium earlier than it is required to reach sub - millisecond periods . in this sense , the reason why there are no observed sub - ms pulsars might be a simple consequence of binary and magnetic field evolution ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to compare this behavior with the only other amxps with a measured spin down in quiescence : sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the overall long term spin frequency in sax j1808.4 - 3658 is _ decreasing _ over an observed baseline of @xmath18 years , suggesting that no significant accretion torque operates during the outbursts .",
    "therefore also this pulsar will not significantly move in the spin distribution diagram on a timescale comparable with the hubble time . unless the neutron star was born with a spin already in the millisecond range",
    ", strong accretion torques must have spun up the pulsar in the past",
    ". its current magnetic field and average mass accretion rate might be instead too small to allow a significant spin up during the outbursts .",
    "therefore the spin evolution of these two amxps is compatible with a scenario in which amxps evolve close to the spin equilibrium on a timescale shorter than it is required to spin up to the sub - millisecond range .    before drawing a firm conclusion it is important to investigate the spin evolution of more accreting neutron stars , but it seems justified here to propose that , given the observed spin evolution of igr j00291 and sax j1808 , sub - millisecond pulsars might be , at best , extremely rare .",
    "a first achievement for the recycling theory arrived with the discovery of the first accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar in 1998 @xcite .",
    "another fundamental step has been the recent detection of a millisecond radio pulsar in a position coincident with a a previously known quiescent neutron star x - ray binary ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this was a further evidence that accreting millisecond pulsars might indeed turn on as millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "however , there was still a missing test that needed to be performed before the _ recycling scenario _ could be accepted as the correct theory of accreting neutron stars : the accreting pulsar is spun up , so it must be possible to observe accretion torques in the process of accelerating the neutron star rotation and spin down during quiescence due to magneto dipole torques .",
    "many claims have been made for a detection of an accretion torque in accreting millisecond pulsars , but none of these has been broadly accepted until now because of the presence of timing noise that affects the determination of spin and accretion torques when using a standard coherent timing analysis .",
    "the results presented here show that accretion torques are present in igr j00291 , and the spin evolution over 4 years is entirely consistent with the prediction of the _ recycling scenario_. the gas is channeled along the weak magnetic field lines very close to the neutron star surface , at a distance of less than 24 km from the neutron star center .",
    "furthermore , a slow spin down is detected when the accretion halts ( or is strongly reduced ) , which i ascribe to magnetic dipole spin down as observed in radio pulsars .",
    "this allows the measurement of the magnetic field of the neutron star , which i determine to be @xmath19g@xmath20 g , with an uncertainty on the two extreme values of @xmath21 g .",
    "this value is consistent with that inferred from the accretion torques during the 2004 outburst . given the large uncertainties in the analysis discussed in section 5 , it is still premature to state that the results reported in this paper finally confirm the recycling scenario .",
    "however , it has been shown here that there is no need for new physics to explain the results reported .",
    "for example , there is no evidence for a spin down mechanism other than magneto dipole torques .",
    "there is instead strong evidence for an ordered process that is always present in all observed outbursts that might be ascribed to a motion of the hot spot on the neutron star surface .",
    "finally , i find evidence for igr j00291 being very close to the spin equilibrium , with the pulsar spin evolving on timescales of @xmath22 gyr .",
    "these findings open new possibilities on the interpretation of a lack of detected sub - millisecond pulsars : intrinsic evolutionary processes that modify the mass transfer rate and the magnetic field might bring the pulsar close to the spin equilibrium at a much earlier stage than it is required to reach sub - millisecond periods ."
