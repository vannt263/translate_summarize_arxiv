    "about  @xmath1  -  @xmath2% of optically selected quasars exhibit broad absorption line ( bal ) troughs up to @xmath3 blueward of their corresponding emission lines ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; weymann 2002 ; tolea et al . 2002",
    "; hewett & foltz 2003 ; reichard et al .",
    "these bals are produced via resonant scattering in partially ionized outflows .",
    "bal quasars can be further divided into high- and low - ionization sub - classes ( hibals and lobals ) .",
    "hibal quasars are those objects which show bals only in highly ionized species such as civ and nv , while lobal quasars also show bals in mg ii or al iii .",
    "two different scenarios have been proposed to explain the bal phenomena . in the first scenario ,",
    "the bal region ( balr ) is present with a small covering factor in every qso .",
    "the different appearance of bal and non - bal qsos is solely due to different lines of sight . in a bal qso",
    "our line of sight intercepts the balr while it does not in non - bal qsos . in this scenario ,",
    "the fraction of bal qsos is interpreted as the covering factor of balrs .",
    "this paradigm has also been generalized to interpret the dichotomy of lobal and hibal as an orientation effect , in which low - ionization outflow covers small fraction sky with the bal outflow .",
    "this scenario is consistent with a number of statistical properties , such as the similarity between the uv continuum and emission line spectra for both types of qsos ( e.g. , weymann et al . 1991 ) , their similar millimeter and far - infrared luminosities ( e.g. , willott et al . 2003 ) , as well as their similar large scale environments ( shen et al . 2008 ) . in the second scenario",
    "bals exist only in a relative short phase of qso activity , which is very likely in their early phase of evolution , at least for lobal qsos ( briggs , turnshek & wolfe 1984 ) .",
    "support for the latter scenario includes the excess fraction of lobal quasars among infrared selected quasars ( boroson & meyers 1992 ) , and a special locus in black hole mass versus accretion rate space ( boroson 2002 ) .    in the first scenario the balr is probably located in a preferred direction with respect to the system@xmath4s symmetry axis , e.g. , in the equatorial or polar direction .",
    "higher polarization in the optical continuum in comparison to non - bal qsos suggests that bal qsos are seen nearly edge - on ( goodrich & miller 1995 ; hines & wills 1995 ; cohen et al . 1995 ; wang , wang & wang 2005 ) .",
    "equatorial outflows are also preferred from theoretical considerations for radiatively accelerated winds from an accretion disc or evaporated gas from a putative dusty torus ( punsly 2006 ) .    however , there are indications for both polar and equatorial outflows in radio - loud bal qsos .",
    "it is generally believed that the radio jet is aligned with the symmetry axis of the accretion disk .",
    "thus it can be taken as an indicator of the system inclination . according to the unification scheme of radio quasars ,",
    "a radio - loud quasar would show a flat radio spectrum and a core - dominated morphology when viewed along the radio jet , due to relativistic boosting of the optically thick core .",
    "it would appear as a steep - spectrum radio source with double - lobed morphology when viewed side - ways ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "thus the radio morphology and spectrum can serve as a surrogate for the inclination of the system : in an equatorial outflow model a radio - loud bal qso would appear as a steep - spectrum radio source with double - lobed radio morphology , while the opposite situation will be observed in a polar - outflow model .",
    "becker et al . ( 2000 ) found that bal qsos in the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ) display both steep and flat radio spectra ( see also menou et al .",
    "2001 ) , indicating both polar and equatorial outflows .",
    "other studies suggest a similar result . on the one hand , nearly a dozen double - lobed fr  ii quasars were found , mostly from the sdss and first samples ( wills , brandt , & loar 1999 ; gregg et al .",
    "2000 ; brotherton et al .",
    "2002 ; zhou et al . 2006",
    "; gregg , becker & de vries 2006 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "evidence for polar outflows has also been found in a small number of radio variable bal qsos ( zhou et al 2006 ; ghosh & punsly 2007 ) , in which the radio variability suggests that the radio jet is beamed towards the observer .",
    "the presence of both polar and equatorial outflows can be better interpreted in the context of an evolutionary scenario , rather than the geometrical unification scheme .",
    "further studies of radio - loud bal qsos are necessary in order to fully understand the geometry of outflows in their population .",
    "note that most radio - loud bal qsos with steep radio spectra show compact structures on vla scales , different from classical radio - loud quasars on which the unification scheme is based .",
    "thus it is not clear whether the radio spectrum can be used as an indicator for inclination or not .",
    "powerful fr  ii radio bal qsos are extremely rare among radio - loud bal qsos , and most radio bal qsos are only moderately strong in the radio .",
    "morphological studies of these radio intermediate bal quasars can reveal representative properties of the majority radio population of bal qsos .",
    "currently , less than a handful of such bal qsos have been studied at sufficiently high angular resolution and they have revealed a complex situation .    in previous evn observations , jiang & wang ( 2003 ) observed 3 bal quasars at l band using the phase reference technique . among these three sources , only one ( j1312 + 2319 ) has compact two - sided structure , and the other two are still unresolved .",
    "the jet orientation might be near the line of sight if the compact component is the jet base in these two unresolved sources . in this case",
    "the orientation model may be problematic , at least for these 3 sources .    in this paper ,",
    "we report our evn+merlin observations at 1.6 ghz of eight bal quasars , including equal numbers of hibal and lobal quasars and then give some discussion of the results .",
    "@xmath5 2 presents the observations as well as data reduction and the results are described in @xmath5 3 .",
    "the discussion is contained in @xmath5 4 , and in the last section @xmath5 5 we give the conclusions . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the spectral index convention @xmath6 and a cosmology with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "all values of luminosity used in this paper are calculated with our adopted cosmological parameters .",
    "our bal quasars are comparatively bright sources  ( @xmath10 10 mjy ) , which have been selected from the becker et al .",
    "( 2000 ) bal quasar sample .",
    "evn+merlin phase - reference polarimetric continuum observations were made for 8 bal quasars at l band on 2005 june 22 .",
    "the observations were divided into two runs , each lasting 12 hours . in order to compare the radio morphology of either low- and high - ionization or steep- and flat - spectrum bal quasars ,",
    "our sample included 4 lobal quasars and 4 hibal quasars with both steep and flat spectra on vla scales .",
    "the left / right - circular polarization signals were recorded in 8 baseband channels with a total bandwidth of 32 mhz and 2-bit sampling .",
    "the angular distances of the phase referencing sources to the target sources are less than @xmath11 .",
    "the scan time for each source was about 1.5 hours , and the estimated thermal noise in the total intensity images was no more than 0.1 mjy / beam .",
    "we used oq208/j1407 + 284 and j0927 + 3902 as the d - term calibrators for the 1st and 2nd runs , respectively , and 3c286/j1331 + 305 as the electric vector polarization angle  ( evpa ) calibrator for both runs .",
    "the evn data were correlated at the joint institute for vlbi in european  ( jive ) in dwingeloo .",
    "pipeline results were used for the phase referencing . since the flux densities of all bal quasars in our sample except j1603 + 3002 are lower than 20 mjy on vla scales",
    ", we used non - phase referencing results of j1603 + 3002  ( about 54 mjy , which is strong enough to detect with normal fringe fitting )  to compare with the results from phase referencing .",
    "the results are in good agreement , suggesting that the phase referencing observations of the other sources should also be reliable .",
    "the initial amplitude calibration and the fringe - fitting were performed using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the imaging and self - calibration were carried out in the difmap package ( shepherd , pearson , & taylor 1994 ) and these self - calibrations allowed us to improve the signal to noise ratio in the images .",
    "the estimated uncertainty of the amplitude calibration is about 10 percent .",
    "the detailed information for these observations are listed in table 1 and table 2 , including total flux densities from both evn and merlin , positions shifts , fractional polarization , evpa as well as uncertainty for polarization . moreover , making use of the phase - reference technique , we were able to obtain positions from the vlbi data which are more accurate than those obtained from the vla .",
    "table 3 lists all the position information for target bal sources and phase - reference sources .",
    "the position of the phase tracking center for bal sources is shown in column ( 2 ) and column ( 3 ) , while the name and position of the phase - reference sources are denoted in column ( 4 ) , column ( 5 ) and column ( 6 ) , respectively . in our sample , j1044 + 3656 has the largest shift away from its phase tracking center , about 225 mas east and 225 mas south .",
    "although these shifts might affect the signal to noise ratio , the evn flux densities of our sources are similar to those observed at the vla , suggesting that their influence is too small to be important .",
    "the accurate positions of the bal quasars calculated from the shifts away from the phase tracking centers are listed in the last two columns in table 3 . the 3@xmath12 uncertainty in these positions , which mainly depends on both the angular resolution of the evn at 18 cm and the signal to noise ratio , is @xmath1315 mas .

    "the brightness temperature in the source rest frame for the strongest components of these bal quasars , based on the results of model - fitting , range from @xmath32k to @xmath33k .",

    "however , their central components account for more than 80% of the total flux density , which is significantly different from the structure of csos or fr  ii quasars , which have weak cores at low frequencies in general .",
    "given the weakness of the lobes in both objects at 18  cm , it is plausible that their cores also have steep spectra . therefore , these two sources are similar to other steep - spectrum radio bal quasars except for the detection of weak extended lobes .",
    "the compact , steep - spectrum central component in these two bal quasars suggest a link to the css sources .",
    "the four flat - spectrum sources , j0724 + 4159 , j1413 + 4212 , j1556 + 3517 and j1655 + 3945 , show core - dominated or marginal core - jet structures in the evn / merlin maps .",
    "there are two possible interpretations for this .",
    "if their compact component is relativisticly beamed emission from the base of the jet , the jet in these bal quasars is near the line of sight .",
    "their flat spectra are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the degree of polarization of a few to ten percent is also typical for such sources . on the other hand , the flat",
    ", compact core might be related to the ghz peaked sources ( gps )   ( e.g. , benn et al .",
    "noting that with an @xmath34 between 3.6 cm and 20 cm for j0724 + 4159 , the peak frequency is likely to be around a few ghz in the observer s rest frame .",
    "for the other three , with spectral indexes of @xmath35 and 0.2 between 3.6 cm and 20 cm , the turnover frequency is also likely to be in the ghz range although further observations are needed to confirm this .",
    "our results suggest that the simple unification of bal and non - bal quasars by orientation is problematic .",
    "all the bal quasars in our sample have compact radio morphology , including two - sided structure sources .",
    "if these bal quasars are intrinsically small sources with relativistic jets , they can be observed either pole - on and edge - on .",
    "this scenario is not consistent with the current popular disk - wind models .",
    "basing on their radio spectrum and morphology , the steep - spectrum bal quasars could be classified as css , while the flat - spectrum bal quasars might be gps sources  ( becker et al .",
    "2000 ; gregg et al .",
    "both css and gps sources are generally thought to represent the early stage in quasar lifetimes ( @xmath36dea 1998 ) . due to their low luminosity",
    ", these bal quasars might be located at the low end of radio power . meanwhile , as for those radio luminous bal quasars , a significant anti - correlation between radio loudness and the strength of the bal features is exhibited in a total of eleven fr  ii - bal quasars  ( gregg , becker & vries , 2006 ) so far .",
    "the rarity of the fr  ii - bal quasars indicates that the period of fr - ii type combined bal feature is very short  ( gregg et al .",
    "this suggests an evolutionary picture in which fr  ii - bal sources are frustrated by the obscuring bal shroud until the quasars can boil away enough of the material through radiation pressure .",
    "meanwhile , comparing the black hole mass and accretion rate between two small samples of bal and non - bal quasars , yuan & wills ( 2003 ) suggests that bal quasars have a more plentiful fuel supply than non - bal quasars , which might be related to the young age of this kind of source .",
    "in addition , by using optical information from released sdss data , we derived black hole masses for 7 bal quasars in our sample within the range 9.3 @xmath37 to 4.5 @xmath38 ( see detailed information in table 4 ) . despite the limited numbers in the sample , the comparatively low black hole masses of these bal quasars might also be connected to their stage in the evolutionary sequence .",
    "we present the results of evn plus merlin polarization observations of 8 bal quasars at 1.6 ghz , including 4 lobals and 4 hibals with either steep or flat spectra on vla scales .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized as follows :    * only one steep - spectrum source , j1122 + 3124 , shows two - sided structure on the scale of 2  kpc .",
    "the other four steep - spectrum sources and three flat - spectrum sources display either an unresolved image or a core - jet structure on scales of less than three hundred parsecs , well within the galaxy size . in all cases , the marginally resolved core is the dominant radio component . making use of the phase - reference technique ,",
    "celestial positions are derived from our observations which are more accurate than those from the vla .",
