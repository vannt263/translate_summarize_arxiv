    "0.1 in    electrical response of a composite material made up of conducting and insulating components to an external field is still of much interest . to find the electrical conduction properties of random mixtures",
    "one usually models a network with the notions of percolative processes @xcite as a basic framework . for",
    "simplicity one may consider a lattice - based percolation and assume that the occupied bonds ( with a probability @xmath5 ) are metallic or good conductors and the rest of the unoccupied bonds ( with a probability @xmath6 ) are insulators or very poor conductors .",
    "so it turns out that one is dealing with a random electrical network where each bond of the regular lattice constitutes an appropriate circuit element . to study the linear direct current ( dc ) response of a random binary mixture",
    ", one considers it to be a random ( linear ) resistor network ( @xmath7 ) where the conductance @xmath8 of a circuit element assumes the value @xmath9 with probability @xmath5 , or @xmath10 (= 0 for insulators ) with the complementary probability @xmath6 .",
    "when one attempts to study the alternating current ( ac ) response of such a system at a frequency @xmath11 , the elementary conductances @xmath9 and @xmath10 do , in general , become complex quantities , termed as complex ` admittances ' ( inverse of impedances ) , because of the presence of inductances and/ or capacitances in some parts of the circuit .",
    "electrical conductivities ( both dc and ac ) of various composite systems , have been the subject of numerous studies @xcite . on the theoretical side , analytical calculations involving related maxwell s equations with appropriate boundary conditions , effective medium approximation ( @xmath4 ) , series expansion method , monte carlo simulation , model random resistor network ( @xmath7 ) , etc .",
    "are employed to study various interesting behaviors .",
    "the key experimental facts to be contended with by a model in the case of nonlinear dc response have been discussed in our recent works @xcite . to reproduce the very low percolation threshold , a ` low'-temperature resistance minimum , and the nonlinear electric ( dc ) response of metal - insulator composites , we had introduced in our original work @xcite a new semi - classical bond percolation model . the distinguishing feature in this model ( compared to earlier @xmath7 , etc . )",
    "is the possibility of a local tunneling/ dielectric breakdown ( beyond a microscopic threshold voltage , @xmath12 ) between two metallic bonds separated by a nearest neighbor lattice distance .",
    "we call these specially positioned insulating bonds , tunneling or ` t - bonds ' . all the other insulating bonds separated farther away remain insulating at any voltage however large . clearly , since the positions of these t - bonds are totally correlated to the positions of the metallic bonds in a particular ( random ) configuration , this model may be considered as a _ correlated bond percolation _ model .",
    "the percolative phase transition aspects @xcite and the dielectric breakdown aspects @xcite for this model have already been discussed elsewhere .",
    "based upon this correlated bond percolation , the circuit made of the random network of resistors and t - bonds has been called a @xmath0 ( random resistor cum tunneling bond network ) .    in the present work which is a sequel to our work on the nonlinear dc response of the @xmath0 @xcite ( referred to as i from now on )",
    ", we are concerned with the modeling of the generic ac response of a whole variety of experimental systems within the @xmath0 framework ( reported briefly first in the ref.@xcite ) .",
    "experiments on the complex ac conductance @xmath13 in various composite systems , dispersed metals etc . , as well as many disordered/ amorphous systems @xcite , report a non - integer power - law behavior of the modulus , @xmath14^{1/2}$ ] . at a fixed voltage and at a moderately low-@xmath15 , @xmath16 \\propto \\omega^{\\alpha}$ ] , where @xmath17 0.7 ( the case of very low @xmath15 s is discussed later ) .",

    "there has been a recent claim @xcite for 3d carbon - wax composites that @xmath22 1.4 .",
    "we shall comment on this later .    in the traditional @xmath1 network models",
    "used to study the ac response of composites , the conducting bonds are pure ( real ) resistors and all the insulating bonds may behave as capacitors in the presence of an ac - field . a fairly complete review and references ( from the percolative aspect ) on the linear response",
    "may be found in the ref .",
    "another more recent review in this regard is due to shalaev @xcite .",
    "if one applies an ac electric field across our @xmath0 model , a t - bond between two nearby metallic bonds are expected to behave as a capacitor .",
    "note that _ perfect _ capacitors at all the t - bonds correspond to a situation where all the t - bonds have zero dc conductance at low voltages , and hence the @xmath0 is in its _ lower linear dc ( or , ohmic ) regime_. similarly , _ leaky _",
    "capacitors with a very low constant conductance for all the t - bonds , implies that the @xmath0 is in its _ upper linear dc regime_. to obtain the nonlinear ac response in the truly nonlinear dc regime , one has to let the t - bonds be active or passive according to the voltage differences across them . in this work",
    "we study the nonlinear ac response in either the upper or the lower linear dc regimes only .",
    "further , we make a simplifying assumption that all the capacitances across insulators farther than the nearest neighbor distance are zero . based on the @xmath0 model , this model for studying ac response may thus be called a _ correlated rc ( crc ) model_. we believe that the simplicity of our model is physically appealing and realistic enough .",
    "since the capacitors placed in this way never percolates by themselves , the @xmath23 is expected to connect nonlinearly between its own lower and upper ac saturation regimes of @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .    to make the above discussions more concrete we show in fig .  1 , a typical numerical result for the real part of the ac conductance for @xmath5 = 0.52 in a 20@xmath2620 size sample with leaky capacitors",
    ". there may be some genuine concerns whether the upper saturation of the ac conductance does actually occur in realistic samples . in response",
    "we note that in most of the early experiments , the steady frequency required to approach the upper ac saturation regime were probably too high to be accessible .",
    "further , we find at least one experiment on @xmath27-doped @xmath28 sample @xcite , where the upper saturation is clearly observed .    as a pedagogical example ( which will be useful for our interpretations of the @xmath4 and the simulation results in the sequel ) , one may calculate the complex @xmath29 for some simple prototype circuits using the capacitive conductance @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the microscopic capacitance and @xmath32 . for the case of fig .",

    "we assume that a sinusoidal voltage @xmath52 is applied across the network .",

    "thus , the quantity @xmath73 is always negative .",
    "further , @xmath74 is also negative for @xmath75 and approaches @xmath76 quadratically as @xmath25 .",
    "we will take only the absolute value of the square - rooted expression for two reasons ; ( i ) @xmath77 in fig .",
    "3 achieves the necessary upper ac saturation since the built - in square - root function in the computer uses exactly that , and ( ii ) this procedure keeps @xmath78 for all @xmath79 ( needed since @xmath80 ) .",
    "let us first check the @xmath25 limit .",
    "the dissipative part of the complex conductance , @xmath77 , should be positive , finite , and greater than @xmath81 in this limit .",
    "further , the reactive part @xmath82 of the @xmath2 network must become zero ( i.e. , show no response ) when the driving field oscillates much faster than the network s relaxation time ( or , the _ time - constant _ ) .",
    "now , in this limit , re  g_e ( ) = ( 2p_o-1)2 + 1 2     12  |(2p_t-1)| , [ ginfi ] and thus for all @xmath83 , @xmath84 . also , clearly @xmath82 in this limit is zero .",
    "thus , both the conditions hold in the @xmath25 limit .",

    "hence the @xmath4 can not distinguish between a percolating and a non - percolating configuration from their low-@xmath15 behavior .",

    "in passing we would like to quote the extremely low - frequency @xmath4 exponent in the case of 3d . by looking at the @xmath4 expressions for @xmath69 which are the analogues of eqs .",
    "( [ recon ] ) and ( [ imcon ] ) for a simple cubic lattice at its @xmath4 percolation threshold ( @xmath93 = 1/3 in 3d ) , one finds again that @xmath94 ( in 3d ) .",
    "we show in fig .  3 a log - log plot of @xmath77 against @xmath15 in 2d [ eq .",
    "( [ recon ] ) ] . in conformity with the asymptotic expansions obtained above analytically for very small @xmath15 s , the @xmath4 results shown in the fig .",
    "3 give @xmath95 for all @xmath96 except for the special case of @xmath88 .",
    "we have @xmath97 both in the very low and in the moderately low-@xmath15 regimes much below the upper saturation of @xmath98 .",
    "further for each fixed @xmath99 , there is a characteristic @xmath100 around which @xmath101 starts crossing over from 2.0 to the moderately low-@xmath15 exponent of about 0.5 .",
    "the jump of @xmath101 at an extremely low-@xmath15 from 2.0 to 0.5 is the hallmark of the inadequacy of @xmath4 .",
    "one does also note that for a fixed @xmath102 , this crossover region becomes smaller for smaller @xmath5 s .",
    "indeed , the crossover region finally tends to vanish as @xmath103 ( @xmath104 0.18 in 2d ) .",
    "thus , we observe that there are no low to moderate @xmath15 crossovers for for @xmath3 with @xmath94 and similarly for @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "we did also calculate the @xmath4 results with leaky capacitors at each t - bond ( @xmath107 ) , i.e. , in the upper linear dc regime .",
    "the only change here compared to the case of perfect capacitors above is that even at @xmath88 , @xmath108 ( @xmath109=constant ) for very low-@xmath15 . also for all @xmath110 , @xmath111 , as expected .",
    "we would also like to see the behavior of phase - angle of the complex conductance @xmath69 with respect to the frequency ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the phase - angle ( @xmath112 ) is defined through = i m  g_e ( ) re  g_e ( ) . in the fig .  4",
    ", we plot the phase - angle ( @xmath112 ) of the complex conductance against frequency ( @xmath15 ) for the @xmath4 .",
    "as expected , this angle is zero [ just like the @xmath82 ] both at very small and at very large @xmath15 s .",
    "further the phase has a peak value @xmath114 which increases as @xmath5 is decreased and the @xmath15 at which the peak occurs is @xmath5-dependent .",
    "we find from this fig .  4 that the positions of the peaks tend towards zero and that @xmath115 becomes progressively larger as @xmath5 approaches @xmath93 from higher values .",
    "it may be noted that we can not calculate the phase angle @xmath112 for @xmath116 in the @xmath4 with confidence because the quantity @xmath117 takes on _ unphysical negative _ values .",
    "hence we have not shown any curve for @xmath116 in fig .",
    "we now solve kirchoff s laws in our 2d complex network at each node of our correlated @xmath1 model .",
    "we obtain the complex conductance of the macroscopic samples , their real and imaginary parts , the @xmath118 values and the phase - angle through iterative numerical solution using the gauss - seidel relaxation method . in the fig .  5 , we have plotted the modulus of the average complex conductance , @xmath119 against @xmath15 for @xmath120 and for an external sinusoidal voltage @xmath121 .",
    "we let the @xmath60-bonds be _ leaky _ capacitors with a conductance @xmath122 and averaged over the same twenty configurations for each @xmath15 .",
    "so , we are virtually in the upper dc saturation regime . for clarity , we have shown the graphs in fig .  5 from zero to a moderately low @xmath15 ( = 0.1 ) much below the upper ac saturation regime .",
    "we find that for @xmath123  , the respective graphs in fig .  1 and fig .",
    "5 are fitted very well with the eq .",
    "( [ gomega ] ) such that @xmath124 .",
    "thus , in the moderately low-@xmath15 regime , @xmath91 obtained experimentally in varieties of systems @xcite , and in an ` extended pair approximation ' ( epa ) theory @xcite is close to what we obtain here ( i.e. , 0.7 ) .",
    "we remark here that for a 2d system exactly at @xmath93  , @xmath94 both in the simple @xmath1 model ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) and the @xmath4 of our correlated @xmath1 model .",
    "indeed , both of them fall short of the realistic value of @xmath91 not only at @xmath3 , but also at any @xmath102 .",
    "further , these theoretical and experimental results do not support any evidence for the statement that @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "for example , for our @xmath0 model near @xmath93 in 2d , @xmath126 , whereas @xmath127 . indeed ,",
    "as we had commented recently @xcite , there is no good physical argument supporting the equality .",
    "the main point in the comment is that since the actual experimental data become flat at large @xmath15 , it is quite well - known that the exponent obtained may depend crucially on the arbitrarily chosen ( i.e. , without any particular physical reason ) upper cut - off in @xmath15 for fitting purposes .",
    "consequently , the possibility of an unique function should be explored ( as we do here ) which fits all the way from the lower to the upper saturation range ( if sufficient data are available ) , and then the power - law behavior in the moderately low-@xmath15 range should be extracted from that function .",
    "now , as we had mentioned before , we know of at least one experiment by pollak @xcite on @xmath27-doped @xmath28 single crystals at sufficiently low temperatures , where the upper saturation of the @xmath77 may be clearly observed .",
    "the frequency range used in that work is from about @xmath128 to about @xmath129 .",
    "we did not try to fit them by our method since no data below @xmath128 was available . in any case",
    "we note that the upper saturation is also consistent with the fact that the measured relaxation time for this sample is about @xmath130 s. in passing we do also note that in this system as well , the doping concentration of @xmath27 is extremely low : from about @xmath131 to about @xmath132 , and that the pristine @xmath28 is an insulator .",
    "we observe that the upper saturation value of the conductivity for this experiment @xcite is about 0.1 s / m , and that the data for all the three concentrations used for @xmath27 , fall closely enough to their fitting function in the high frequency range , but not so well in the low/ moderate frequency range .",
    "the power - law exponent @xmath91 ( around @xmath133 ) seems to be close to 2.0 .",
    "next , we we would like to emphasize that the apparently excellent fitting shown in fig",
    ".  1 with eq .  ( [ gomega ] ) may be misleading to the eye in the very low-@xmath15 regime .",
    "a careful analysis of data in a more revealing log - log plot shows that for very low @xmath15 , the fittings may be actually quite bad .",
    "we observed for the two elementary circuits ( in fig .",
    "2 ) for very low @xmath15 , @xmath134 or @xmath15 depending upon whether the circuit is percolating or not .",
    "similarly , we anticipate that for extremely low @xmath15 and in the lower dc regime , the @xmath2 network would also show such simple behaviors ( instead of a more complicated percolative behavior in the moderately low-@xmath15 regime as described above ) .",
    "further this simple behavior is expected to persist ( as seen in our @xmath4 results ) generically for each @xmath5 up to some scaled crossover frequency @xmath135 depending on @xmath5 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath31 . for @xmath138",
    ", we expect macroscopic percolative effects to gain control and instead of eq .",

    ", we show the log - log plot for the @xmath118 value of @xmath59 and observe a very convincing quadratic behavior with @xmath140 for @xmath141 .",
    "this observation is totally matching with our analyses for fig .",
    "2(a ) . for @xmath138",
    ", we get a very good fit for the intermediate frequency range with the general eq .",
    "( [ acfit ] ) where @xmath142 ( which is much larger than 0.7 ) .",
    "next in the fig .  7",
    ", we show another fit for a single configuration ( at @xmath143 ) with perfect capacitors at the t - bonds ( @xmath144 , non - percolating ) of the @xmath2 network with @xmath43=20 . in this case",
    "one can easily observe that in the very low-@xmath15 range up to a crossover frequency @xmath145 0.01 , @xmath146 .",
    "this behavior is akin to that of the elementary circuit of fig .",
    "further , beyond @xmath135  , we do again have an excellent fitting with the eq .",
    "( [ acfit ] ) with @xmath147 .",
    "so we have two things to note here for non - percolating configurations ( with perfect capacitors , i.e. , in the lower dc regime ) : ( i ) the very low-@xmath15 behavior is linear in @xmath15 , and ( ii ) the intermediate frequency behavior seems to give a lower value for the exponent compared to that for percolating configurations ( e.g. , as in the upper dc regimes of fig .",
    "1 and fig .  6 where @xmath148 0.7 near @xmath93 ) .",
    "note that for the non - percolating configurations ( only at @xmath93 ) in the lower linear dc regime , @xmath94 in the case of @xmath4 as well .    for many practical situations ,",
    "this intermediate frequency range ( away from both the lower and the upper ac saturation regimes ) is of prime interest .",
    "for t - bonds with leaky capacitors at any @xmath83 ( i.e. , in the upper dc regime ) , we find that @xmath91 has a minimum value of about 0.7 near @xmath93 , and increases on both sides of it with a value of about 3.0 at @xmath5 = 0.3 ( as shown above ) and of about 1.35 ( not explicitly shown here ) at @xmath5 = 0.7 .",
    "clearly , this result has a qualitative similarity with the dc nonlinearity exponent @xmath149 as a function of @xmath5 as shown in the fig .",

    "this @xmath0 ( random resistor cum tunneling - bond network ) driven by an ac electric field gives rise to a correlated @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) model because we place the capacitors only at the t - bonds whose positions are correlated to the positions of the nearest neighbor gaps between two ohmic bonds , as discussed above . for simplicity , the rest of the insulating bonds",
    "are assumed to remain inactive at any voltage however large .",

    "for the power - law type low voltage dc response , there are two different power - law regimes for , say @xmath23 , much below its ac upper saturation regime . since any realistic sample should not be able to respond to an extremely large @xmath15 , @xmath38 must vanish as @xmath25 , and that does automatically happen in our @xmath2 model . thus @xmath157 is real and finite . for non - percolating systems at very low-@xmath15 , @xmath158 , whereas if percolating , @xmath16 \\sim \\omega^2 $ ] .",
    "this happens irrespective of the value of @xmath5 .",
    "next for @xmath159 , i.e. , at moderately low @xmath15 s ( still much below the upper ac saturation regime ) , the system crosses over to a non - integer power law behavior with a positive exponent @xmath101 which depends on the value of @xmath5 .",
    "if we use leaky capacitors at the t - bonds , the system would percolate for all @xmath160 ( @xmath104 0.18 ) @xcite .",
    "for such situations , if @xmath123 , @xmath91 has the minimum value of about 0.7 and this value matches with that for many experiments .",
    "away from @xmath93 ( both for higher and lower values ) , with leaky capacitors at the t - bonds , @xmath101 becomes progressively larger than 0.7 .",
    "now , if we use perfect capacitors , then for non - percolating configurations close to @xmath93 , @xmath161 which is significantly lower than 0.7 . it may be noted that both the @xmath4 and the traditional @xmath1 model can not obtain anything other than the value of 0.5 for @xmath5 close to @xmath93 .",
    "further , in the case of @xmath4 , the exponent @xmath101 = 2.0 for any @xmath102 .",
    "we did also look at the phase angle @xmath153 of the complex @xmath59 at several @xmath5 s .",
    "since @xmath38 vanishes both at very high and very low @xmath15 s ( at any @xmath5 ) , @xmath153 would also have this property as a function of @xmath15 with at least one peak value ( @xmath115 ) somewhere in - between .",
    "there is one curve for each @xmath5 with a different peak value . in the case of @xmath4 , @xmath153",
    "can not be calculated for any @xmath116 and so in fig .  4 ,",
    "we have shown them only for @xmath162 . for the @xmath2 network",
    ", we do not have this pathology , and hence in the fig .",
    "8 , we have shown it for 0.3 @xmath163 0.7 . in general , @xmath115 increases both in the @xmath4 and our numerical solution of the @xmath2 model as @xmath5 decreases . for the latter ,",
    "it is about 0.4 rad at @xmath164 and 1.1 rad for @xmath165 .",
    "it is interesting to note that at @xmath3 , @xmath115 takes the universal value of about @xmath152 rad in the simple @xmath1 model , numerical solution and the @xmath4 of our @xmath2 model .",
