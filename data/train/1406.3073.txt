    "to reliably predict the transverse momentum distribution of the final state particles in some scattering processes in hadron collisions may require all order resummation of large logarithms . among these hard processes ,",
    "two of the classic examples include the drell - yan lepton pair production and the semi - inclusive hadron production in deep inelastic scattering ( sidis )  @xcite . in both processes , there are two separate scales : the virtuality of the virtual photon @xmath1 and the transverse momentum of either final state virtual photon @xmath2 in drell - yan process or final state hadron @xmath3 in dis process .",
    "large logarithms exist in higher order perturbative calculations when @xmath1 is much larger than @xmath2 and are of the form : @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the resummation of these large logarithms are carried out by applying the transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) factorization and evolutions  @xcite , where the non - perturbative form factors associated with the tmd parton distributions play an important role  @xcite .",
    "this resummation is usually referred to as the tmd resummation or collins - soper - sterman ( css ) resummation . following the qcd factorization arguments and the universality of the tmd parton distributions",
    ", we shall expect that the non - perturbative functions determined from drell - yan processes can be applied to the sidis processes as well , subject to the needed modification for taking into account the fragmentation function contribution in order to generate final state transverse momentum distributions .",
    "recent experimental measurements of sidis processes from the hermes  @xcite and compass  @xcite collaborations provide an opportunity to understand the tmd distributions in both processes , which have already attracted several theory studies  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the current paper is to investigate the universality of the tmd parton distributions in the css resummation formalism to simultaneously describe the transverse momentum distributions in the drell - yan and sidis processes   region from hera measurements have been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the css resummation , where a totally different functional form has been used to describe the experimental data .",
    "since the hera data covers mostly the small-@xmath5 region , we will come back to them in a future publication . ] .",
    "we will start with the well - known brock - landry - nadolsky - yuan ( blny ) fit to the transverse momentum dependent drell - yan lepton pair productions in hadronic collisions  @xcite .",
    "the blny fit parameterizes the non - perturbative form factors as @xmath6 in the impact parameter space with @xmath7 and @xmath8 representing the longitudinal momentum fractions of the incoming nucleons carried by the initial state quark and antiquark .",
    "these parameters are constrained from the combined fit to the low transverse momentum distributions of drell - yan lepton pair production with @xmath9 in fixed target experiments and @xmath10 production ( @xmath11 ) at the tevatron .",
    "these results can also be applied to @xmath12 production at the tevatron . however",
    ", this parameterization does not apply to the sidis processes measured by hermes and compass collaborations : if we extrapolate the above parameterization down to the typical hermes kinematics where @xmath13 is around @xmath14 , we can not describe the transverse momentum distribution of hadron production in the experiments  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a novel parametrization form to consistently describe the drell - yan data and sidis data in the css resummation formalism with a universal non - perturbative tmd function . in order to describe the sidis data ,",
    "it is necessary to modify the original blny parameterization . in the original blny parameterization",
    ", there is a strong correlation between the @xmath5 and the @xmath13 dependence of the non - perturbative form factor  @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the square of the center - of - mass energy of the incoming hadrons .",
    "therefore , at the first step , we will separate out the @xmath5-dependence , and assume a power law behavior : @xmath17 .",
    "these two parameterizations ( logarithmic and power law ) differ strongly in the intermediate @xmath5 range .",
    "second , we modify the @xmath18 term in the non - perturbative form factor by following the observation of ref .",
    "@xcite , which has shown that a direct integration of the evolution kernel can describe the sidis and drell - yan data with @xmath1 values ranging from a few to ten gev .",
    "direct integration of the evolution kernel leads to a functional form of @xmath19 , instead of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , we will perform a global fit to the selected set of experimental data with the non - perturbative function : @xmath21 with @xmath0 defined as , @xmath22 after obtaining the tmd non - perturbative function from the fit to the drell - yan data , we apply the fit to the transverse momentum distributions in sidis processes from hermes and compass , which also depend on the final state fragmentation functions .",
    "we find that the new parametrization form can describe well the sidis data , and therefore establish the universality property of the tmd distributions between dis and drell - yan processes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present the theoretical framework of the css formalism and the basic set - up in the calculations of the transverse momentum distributions in drell - yan lepton pair production and sidis processes . in sec.iii , we perform a global fit to the drell - yan data with the modified blny parameterization . in sec .",
    "iv , we apply the newly determined non - perturbative function to the sidis processes and demonstrate that it can consistently describe the transverse momentum distribution measurements from hermes and compass collaborations .",
    "we will also comment on the role of the @xmath23-terms in sidis at the energy range of hermes and compass .",
    "finally , we conclude our paper and comment on the impact of the new fit .",
    "in this section , we review the basic formulas of the css resummation formalism and the theory framework to calculate the transverse momentum distributions for the drell - yan lepton pair production at hadron colliders and semi - inclusive hadron production in dis processes . in the ( low energy )",

    "the first term is dominant in the @xmath34 region , while the second term is dominant in the region of @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the low transverse momentum region to constrain the non - perturbative form factors , which is embedded in the first term of the above equation .    similarly , in the sidis process , we have , @xmath37 which proceeds through exchange of a virtual photon with momentum @xmath38 , and invariant mass @xmath39 .",
    "the differential sidis cross section is written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 with usual dis kinematic variables @xmath30 , @xmath42 , @xmath13 , and @xmath43 . here , @xmath44 , which denotes the momentum fraction of the virtual photon carried by the final state hadron .",
    "the transverse momentum of the final state hadron @xmath3 is defined in the lepton - proton center - of - mass frame .    following the resummation and evolution of these hard processes , we can write down the following expressions for the cross sections in the impact parameter space , @xmath45 where @xmath46 with @xmath47 the euler constant , @xmath48 represent the momentum fractions carried by the incoming quark and antiquark in the drell - yan processes , @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the relevant longitudinal parton distribution and fragmentation functions , respectively . in the above equation ,",

    "meanwhile , we will keep @xmath52 coefficients and @xmath23 terms at one - loop order in the numerical calculation .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0-prescription in the css resummation formalism introduces a non - perturbative form factor , and a generic form was suggested  @xcite , @xmath53 here , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are functions of the impact parameter @xmath56 and they also depend on the choice of @xmath57 . in the literature , these functions have been assumed gaussian forms for simplicity , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "the most successful approach is the so - called blny parameterization mentioned in the introduction , which has been encoded in resbos program  @xcite with successful applications for vector boson production at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "we notice that the above adaption is not the only choice to apply to the css resummation  @xcite .",

    "@xcite .    the @xmath63 dependence of @xmath59 , cf .",
    "( [ blny0 ] ) , follows from renormalization - group invariance of soft - gluon radiation , and needs to be modified in order to simultaneously describe the drell - yan and sidis processes using the tmd formalism . for that",
    ", we follow the observation made in ref .  @xcite that the @xmath55 function should have logarithmic dependence on @xmath56 , instead of @xmath64 dependence . therefore , in this work , we consider the following parameterization , @xmath65 at small-@xmath56 , the above function reduces to power behavior as @xmath64 , which is consistent to the power counting analysis in ref .",
    "however , at large @xmath56 , the logarithmic behavior will lead to different predictions depending on @xmath13 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above form has been suggested in an earlier paper by collins and soper  @xcite , but has not yet been adopted in any phenomenological study .",
    "in addition , we will modify the @xmath5-dependence in the non - perturbative function as mentioned in the introduction so that @xmath66 where we have fixed @xmath67 , @xmath68 is motivated by the so - called saturation model , in which it was assumed that gluon distribution ( or quark distribution ) has saturation behavior as @xmath69  @xcite . ] and @xmath70 .",

    "hence , it is important to perform a global fit to the existing experimental data to test out the proposed non - perturbative function forms .",
    "in addition to the pure gaussian form as adopted in the blny fit , and the logarithmic dependence form as proposed in this work , another choice of the non - perturbative form has also been suggested , such as the qiu - zhang prescription in ref .",

    ", we recap our findings , and name it as the siyy-1 form , as follows .",
    "@xmath116 where we adopted the @xmath0 description , cf .",
    "( 2 ) , with @xmath76 , and have fixed @xmath117gev , @xmath68 and @xmath70 in a global analysis of the low energy drell - yan data from e288 , e605 , r209 , and @xmath10 boson data from cdf and d0 at the tevatron ( in both run i and ii ) . in total , we have included 140 data points , fitted with 3 shape parameters ( @xmath118 ) and 7 normalization parameters .",
    "the chi - square per degree of freedom is about 1.3 , cf .",
    "table i. we found that at the 68%  c.l .",
    ", @xmath119 the detailed comparison of the fit to the experimental data can be found in figs . 1 to 7 . using the result of the fit",
    ", we showed in fig . 8",
    "that the lhc data can also be well described by the siyy-1 fit .    after obtaining the satisfactory fit to the drell - yan type data , we proposed to add an additional term to the siyy-1 form with the @xmath102 dependence for describing the transverse momentum distribution of the semi - inclusive hadron production in dis processes , cf .",
    "iv . we shall name that as the siyy-2 form , which is @xmath120 where the factor @xmath95 associated with the @xmath54 coefficient is due to the fact that only one hadron beam is involved in the sidis processes , in contrast to two hadron beams in the drell - yan type processes .",
    "furthermore , the additional @xmath96 term is to parametrize the non - perturbative effect associated with the fragmentation of the final state parton into the observed hadron .",
    "@xmath102 represents the momentum fraction of the virtual photon carried by the final state hadron in the sidis process . using the findings from fitting to the drell - yan type data for the 3 shape parameters ( @xmath118 )",
    ", we found that the experimental data from hermes and compass can be well described by the siyy-2 form with @xmath121 here , we are not performing a fit for the lack of more precise data .",
    "instead , we merely find a value of @xmath96 to show that the proposed siyy-2 form can describe the existing sidis data if only the leading power prediction ( defined as the resummation result without including the @xmath23-term ) is used for the comparison , cf .",
    "the reason for not including the @xmath23-term in this comparison is that the typical energy scales ( @xmath13 ) of the sidis data from hermes and compass experiments are low , at a few gev . hence , the theoretical uncertainties in applying the css formalism is not well under control , and the @xmath23-term contribution is expected to be sizable as compared to the leading power contribution .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "followed by that , we showed in fig .",
    "11 that for future sidis data with a larger @xmath13 value , the css formalism will provide a better description of the data , where the @xmath23-term contribution is expected to be small in the region that the resummation effect is important , _",
    "i.e. , _ in the low transverse momentum region . in other words",
    ", we have demonstrated that the proposed siyy-1 and siyy-2 non - perturbative forms can be used in the css resummation formalism to simultaneously describe the drell - yan and sidis data .",
    "since the @xmath13 dependence in the non - perturbative functions is universal among the spin - independent and spin - dependent observables in the hard scattering processes , including drell - yan lepton pair production in hadronic collisions , semi - inclusive hadron production in dis , and di - hadron production in @xmath122 annihilations , we expect that the new function obtained in this paper shall have broad applications in the analysis of the spin asymmetries in these processes .",
    "one particular example is the so - called sivers single transverse spin asymmetries in sidis and drell - yan processes , where the sign change of the asymmetries in these two processes has been one of top questions in hadron physics . with the proposed siyy-1 and siyy-2 forms",
    ", we could further test the universality property of the tmd formalism .    before concluding this section",
    ", we would like to update the result of the fit using a pure gaussian form , similar to the blny or kn fits , but including the more precise @xmath10 boson data from the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron run ii . as noted in the introduction section ,",
    "it is difficult to simultaneously describe the drell - yan and sidis data using a pure gaussian form .",
    "nevertheless , it is still useful to present an update of the type of fit which is found to be able to describe very well the drell - yan type data such as the production of @xmath12 and @xmath10 bosons at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "we will name this updated pure gaussian form as the siyy - g form here , which is @xmath123 for describing only the drell - yan type of processes in hadronic collisions .",
    "after fixing @xmath124 to be @xmath125gev and @xmath76 , we found that at the 68%  c.l .",
    ", @xmath126 where we have fixed @xmath72 at its best fit value .",
    "the quality of the fit to the same set of drell - yan data is similar to that using the siyy-1 form .",
    "the obtained @xmath55 value is consistent with the estimation from lattice qcd calculation , related to the vacuum average of the wilson loop operator , as @xmath127  @xcite .",
    "as noted before , in the small @xmath56 region ( much less than @xmath57 ) , @xmath128 .",
    "clearly , the value of @xmath55 found in the siyy - g fit is consistent with our findings in the siyy-1 fit whose @xmath55 value in the small @xmath56 limit corresponds to @xmath129 .",
    "we thank alexei prokudin for cross checking the @xmath23-term contributions in sidis in sec .",
