    "this document summarizes the potential of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) for high mass and high transverse momentum physics and explains why the lhc is expected to provide a crucial next step in our understanding of nature .",
    "the results given here are based on publically available work done by many atlas and cms collaborators either as part of the design of the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite detectors or in subsequent investigations . on the basis of these studies",
    ", we believe that the physics potential of the lhc is enormous : among currently approved projects in high energy physics , it uniquely has sufficient energy and luminosity to probe in detail the tev energy scale relevant to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) is a very successful description of the interactions of the components of matter at the smallest scales ( @xmath0 m ) and highest energies ( @xmath1gev ) accessible to current experiments .",
    "it is a quantum field theory that describes the interaction of spin-@xmath2 , point - like fermions , whose interactions are mediated by spin-1 gauge bosons .",
    "the existence of the gauge bosons and the form of their interactions are dictated by local gauge invariance , a manifestation of the symmetry group of the theory , which for the sm is @xmath3 .",
    "the fundamental fermions are leptons and quarks ; the left - handed states are doublets under the @xmath4 group , while the right - handed states are singlets .",
    "there are three generations of fermions , each generation identical except for mass .",
    "the origin of this structure , and the breaking of generational symmetry ( flavor symmetry ) remain a mystery .",
    "there are three leptons with electric charge @xmath5 , the electron ( @xmath6 ) , muon ( @xmath7 ) and tau lepton ( @xmath8 ) ; and three electrically neutral leptons , the neutrinos @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "similarly there are three quarks with electric charge @xmath12 , up ( @xmath13 ) , charm ( @xmath14 ) and top ( @xmath15 ) ; and three with electric charge @xmath16 , down ( @xmath17 ) , strange ( @xmath18 ) and bottom ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the quarks are triplets under the @xmath20 group and thus carry an additional `` charge , '' referred to as color .",
    "there is mixing between the three generations of quarks , which in the sm is parameterized by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm )  @xcite matrix but is not explained .    in the sm",
    "the @xmath21 symmetry group describes the electroweak interactions .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken by the existence of a ( postulated ) higgs field with a non - zero expectation value , leading to massive vector bosons  the @xmath22 and @xmath23  which mediate the weak interaction ; the photon of electromagnetism remains massless .",
    "one physical degree of freedom remains in the higgs sector , a neutral scalar boson @xmath24 , which is presently unobserved .",
    "the @xmath20 group describes the strong interaction ( quantum chromodynamics or qcd ) .",
    "the eight vector gluons that mediate this interaction themselves carry color charges and so are self - interacting .",
    "this implies that the qcd coupling @xmath25 is small for large momentum transfers but large for small momentum transfers , and leads to the confinement of quarks inside color - neutral hadrons . attempting to free",
    "a quark produces a jet of hadrons through quark - antiquark pair production and gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the smallness of the strong coupling at large mass scales makes it possible to calculate reliably cross sections for the production of massive particles at the lhc .",
    "the basic elements of the standard model were proposed in the 1960 s and 1970 s  @xcite . increasing experimental evidence of the correctness of the model accumulated through 1970 s and 1980 s :    * observation of ( approximate ) scaling in deep inelastic scattering experiments , showing the existence of point - like scattering centers inside nucleons , later identified with quarks  @xcite ; * observation of the @xmath14 and @xmath19 quarks  @xcite ; * observation of neutral weak currents from @xmath23 exchange  @xcite ; * observation of jet structure and three - jet final states resulting from gluon radiation in @xmath26 and hadron - hadron collisions  @xcite ; * direct observation of the @xmath27 and @xmath23 at the cern @xmath28 collider  @xcite .    following these discoveries , ever more precise experiments at lep and slc",
    "have provided verification of the couplings of quarks and leptons to the gauge bosons at the level of 1-loop radiative corrections ( @xmath29 ) . also , the top quark has been discovered at fermilab with a very large mass ( @xmath30gev )  @xcite .    with the recent direct observation of the @xmath11  @xcite",
    ", only one particle from the standard model has yet to be observed , the higgs boson .",
    "the higgs is very important because it holds the key to the generation of @xmath27 , @xmath23 , quark and lepton masses .",
    "some of the sm parameters , specifically those of the ckm matrix , are not well determined .",
    "in particular , while cp violation is accommodated in the sm through a phase in the ckm quark mixing matrix , it remains poorly understood .",
    "cp violation was first observed in k decays  @xcite .",
    "recently , direct cp violation has been seen in k decays  @xcite , and evidence for cp violation in @xmath31 has been seen in @xmath32-factories  @xcite and in cdf  @xcite .",
    "more precise measurements over the next few years should determine these parameters or demonstrate the sm can not adequately explain cp violation .",
    "the minimal sm can only accommodate massless neutrinos and hence no neutrino oscillations .",
    "there is evidence for such oscillations from measurements by superkamiokande of neutrinos produced in the atmosphere and from a deficit in the flux of electron neutrinos from the sun@xcite .",
    "while it is easy to extend the sm to include neutrino masses , understanding their small values seems to require qualitatively new physics .",
    "the success of the standard model  @xcite of strong ( qcd ) , weak and electromagnetic interactions has drawn increased attention to its limitations . in its simplest version , the model has 19 parameters  @xcite , the three coupling constants of the gauge theory @xmath33 , three lepton and six quark masses , the mass of the @xmath23 boson which sets the scale of weak interactions , the four parameters which describe the rotation from the weak to the mass eigenstates of the charge @xmath34 quarks ( ckm matrix ) .",
    "all of these parameters are determined with varying errors .",
    "one of the two remaining parameters is the coefficient @xmath35 of a possible @xmath36-violating interaction among gluons in qcd ; limits on the @xmath36 violation in strong interactions imply that it must be very small .",
    "the other parameter is associated with the mechanism responsible for the breakdown of the electroweak @xmath21 to @xmath37 .",
    "this can be taken to be the mass of the as yet undiscovered higgs boson , whose couplings are determined once its mass is given .",
    "additional parameters are needed to accommodate neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "the gauge theory part of the sm has been well tested , but there is little direct evidence either for or against the simple higgs mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking . the current experimental lower bound on the higgs mass is @xmath38@xcite .",
    "if the standard model higgs sector is correct , then precision measurements at the @xmath23 and elsewhere can be used to constrain the higgs mass via its contribution to the measured quantities from higher order quantum corrections to be less than 212  gev  @xcite at 95% confidence . as the higgs mass increases , its self couplings and its couplings to the @xmath27 and @xmath23 bosons grow  @xcite .",
    "this feature has a very important consequence .",
    "either the higgs boson must have a mass less than about 800  gev or the dynamics of @xmath39 and @xmath40 interactions with center of mass energies of order 1  tev will reveal new structure .",
    "it is this simple argument that sets the energy scale that must be probed to guarantee that an experiment will be able to provide information on the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the presence of a single elementary scalar boson is distasteful to many physicists .",
    "if the theory is part of some more fundamental theory , which has some other larger mass scale ( such as the scale of grand unification or the planck scale ) , there is a serious `` fine tuning '' or naturalness problem .",
    "radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass result in a value that is driven to the larger scale unless some delicate cancellation is engineered ( @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are order @xmath44 gev or larger ) .",
    "there are two ways out of this problem which involve new physics at a scale of order 1  tev .",
    "new strong dynamics could enter that provides the scale of @xmath45 , or new particles could appear so that the larger scale is still possible , but the divergences are canceled on a much smaller scale .",
    "it is also possible that there is no higher scale as , for example in models with extra dimensions . in any of the options , standard model , new dynamics or cancellations ,",
    "the energy scale is the same : something must be discovered on the tev scale .",
    "supersymmetry is an appealing concept for which there is , at present , no experimental evidence  @xcite .",
    "it offers the only presently known mechanism for incorporating gravity into the quantum theory of particle interactions , and it provides an elegant cancellation mechanism for the divergences provided that at the electroweak scale the theory is supersymmetric .",
    "the successes of the standard model ( such as precision electroweak predictions ) are retained , while avoiding any fine tuning of the higgs mass .",
    "some supersymmetric models allow for the unification of gauge couplings at a high scale and a consequent reduction of the number of arbitrary parameters .",
    "supersymmetric models postulate the existence of superpartners for all the presently observed particles : bosonic superpartners of fermions ( squarks @xmath46 and sleptons @xmath47 ) , and fermionic superpartners of bosons ( gluinos @xmath48 and gauginos @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "there are also multiple higgs bosons : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "there is thus a large spectrum of presently unobserved particles , whose exact masses , couplings and decay chains are calculable in the theory given certain parameters .",
    "unfortunately these parameters are unknown .",
    "nonetheless , if supersymmetry is to have anything to do with electroweak symmetry breaking , the masses should be in the region 100  gev  1  tev .",
    "an example of the strong coupling scenario is `` technicolor '' or models based on dynamical symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "again , if the mechanism is to have anything to do with electroweak symmetry breaking we would expect new states in the region 100  gev  1  tev ; most models predict a large spectrum .",
    "an elegant implementation of this appealing idea is lacking .",
    "however , all models predict structure in the @xmath39 scattering amplitude at around 1 tev center of mass energy",
    ".    there are also other possibilities for new physics that are not necessarily related to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking . there could be new neutral or charged gauge bosons with mass larger than the @xmath23 and @xmath27 ; there could be new quarks , charged leptons or massive neutrinos ; or quarks and leptons could turn out not to be elementary objects .",
    "it is even possible that there are extra space time dimensions  @xcite@xcite that have observable consequences for energies in the tev mass range .",
    "while we have no definitive expectations for the masses of these objects , the lhc must be able to search for them over its available energy range .",
    "the lhc machine is a proton - proton collider that will be installed in the 26.6 km circumference tunnel formerly used by the lep electron - positron collider at cern  @xcite .",
    "the 8.4 tesla dipole magnets  each 14.2 meters long ( magnetic length )  are of the `` 2 in 1 '' type : the apertures for both beams have a common mechanical structure and cryostat .",
    "these superconducting magnets operate at 1.9k and have an aperture of 56 mm .",
    "they will be placed on the floor in the lep ring after removal and storage of lep .",
    "the 1104 dipoles and 736 quadruples support beams of 7  tev energy and a circulating current of 0.54 a.    bunches of protons separated by 25 ns and with an rms length of 75 mm intersect at four points where experiments are placed .",
    "two of these are high luminosity regions and house the atlas and cms detectors .",
    "two other regions house the alice detector  @xcite , to be used for the study of heavy ion collisions , and lhc - b  @xcite , a detector optimized for the study of @xmath19-mesons and @xmath19-baryons .",
    "the beams cross at an angle of 200@xmath7rad , resulting in peak luminosity of @xmath55 with a luminosity - lifetime of 10 hours .",
    "the expected data samples are @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) fb@xmath58 at @xmath59 ( @xmath55 ) , called low ( high ) luminosity in this document . at the peak luminosity",
    "there are an average of @xmath60 interactions per bunch crossing .",
    "ultimately , the peak luminosity may increase beyond @xmath61 @xmath62 sec@xmath58 .",
    "the machine will also be able to accelerate heavy ions resulting in the possibility of , for example , pb - pb collisions at 1150 tev in the center of mass and luminosity up to @xmath63 @xmath62 sec@xmath58 .    in the @xmath64 version , which will be the focus of the rest of this article",
    ", the lhc can be thought of as a parton - parton collider with beams of partons of indefinite energy .",
    "the effective luminosity  @xcite of these collisions is proportional to the @xmath64 luminosity and falls rapidly with the center of mass energy of the parton - parton system .",
    "the combination of the higher energy and luminosity of the lhc compared to the highest energy collider currently operating , the tevatron , implies that the accessible energy range is extended by approximately a factor of ten .",
    "the fundamental goal is to uncover and explore the physics behind electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this involves the following specific challenges :    * discover or exclude the standard model higgs and/or the multiple higgs bosons of supersymmetry . *",
    "discover or exclude supersymmetry over the entire theoretically allowed mass range up to a few tev . * discover or exclude new dynamics at the electroweak scale .",
    "the energy range opened up by the lhc also gives us the opportunity to search for other , possibly less well motivated , objects :    * discover or exclude any new electroweak gauge bosons with masses below several tev .",
    "* discover or exclude any new quarks or leptons that are kinematically accessible . * discover or exclude extra - dimensions for which the appropriate mass scale is below several tev .",
    "finally we have the possibility of exploiting the enormous production rates for certain standard model particles to conduct the following studies :    * study the properties of the top quark and set limits on exotic decays such as @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "* study of @xmath19-physics , particularly that of @xmath19-baryons and @xmath67 mesons .",
    "an lhc experiment must have the ability to find the unexpected .",
    "new phenomena of whatever type will decay into the particles of the standard model . in order to cover",
    "the lists given above a detector must have great flexibility .",
    "the varied physics signatures for these processes require the ability to reconstruct and measure final states involving the following    * charged leptons , including the @xmath8 via its hadronic decays . *",
    "the electroweak gauge bosons : @xmath27 , @xmath23 and @xmath68 .",
    "* jets of energy up to several tev coming from the production at high transverse momentum of quarks and gluons . *",
    "jets that have @xmath19-quarks within them .",
    "* missing transverse energy carried off by weakly interacting neutral particles such as neutrinos .    in the discussion of physics signals that we present below , it is necessary to estimate production cross sections for both signal and background processes .",
    "this is done using perturbative qcd .",
    "such calculations depend on the parton distribution functions that are used , the energy ( @xmath69 scale ) used in the evaluation of the qcd coupling constant and the structure functions , and the order in qcd perturbation theory that is used .",
    "these issues make comparison between different simulations of the same process difficult .",
    "higher order corrections are not known for all processes and in some cases they are known for the signal and not for the background .",
    "most of the lhc simulations are conservative and use lowest order calculations .",
    "higher order corrections almost always increase the cross sections , typically by a so - called @xmath70 factor of order 1.5 to 2.0 .",
    "the real analysis will of course be based on the best calculations available at the time . at present , the uncertainties from the choice of scale and structure functions are typically at the 20% level .",
    "the total cross - section for @xmath19-quark production is particularly uncertain .",
    "the level of simulation used to study the processes varies quite widely .",
    "for some processes a full geant  @xcite style simulation has been carried out .",
    "such simulations are very slow ( @xmath71  spec95-hr / event ) and are difficult to carry out for processes where a large number of events needs to be simulated and many strategies for extracting signals need to be pursued . in these cases",
    "a particle level simulation and parameterized detector response is used . a lower level of simulation involving partons ( _ i.e. _ , leptons and jets ) and parameterized response is fast and might be required when the underlying parton process is not present in full event generators .",
    "this last level of simulation is useful for exploring signals but often leads to overly optimistic results , particularly when the reconstruction of invariant masses of jets or missing energy are involved .",
    "none of the results included here use this last level of simulation , unless stated explicitly .      two large ,",
    "general - purpose @xmath64 collider detectors are being constructed for lhc : atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite .",
    "both collaborations completed technical proposals for their detectors in december 1994 , and were formally approved in january 1996 .",
    "construction is now underway .",
    "though they differ in most details , the detectors share many common features that are derived from the physics goals of lhc :    * they both include precision electromagnetic calorimetry ; * they both use large magnet systems ( though of different geometries ) in order to obtain good muon identification and precision momentum measurement ; * they both have lepton identification and precision measurement over @xmath72 ; * they both have multi - layer silicon pixel tracker systems for heavy flavor tagging ( the usefulness of this capability is an important lesson from the tevatron ) ; * they both include calorimetry for large @xmath73 coverage in order to obtain the required @xmath74 resolution .",
    "the atlas detector is shown uses a tracking system employing silicon pixels , silicon strip detectors , and a transition radiation tracker , all contained within a 2  tesla superconducting solenoid .",
    "the charged track resolution is @xmath75 at @xmath76gev .",
    "the tracker is surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter using a lead - liquid argon accordion design ; the em calorimeter covers @xmath77 ( with trigger coverage of @xmath78 ) and has a resolution of @xmath79 .",
    "the hadronic calorimeter uses scintillator tiles in the barrel and liquid argon in the endcaps ( @xmath80 ) ; its resolution is @xmath81 .",
    "forward calorimeters cover the region @xmath82 with a resolution better than @xmath83 .",
    "surrounding the calorimeters is the muon system .",
    "muon trajectories are measured using three stations of precision chambers ( mdt s and csc s ) in a spectrometer with bending provided by large air - core toroid magnets .",
    "the resulting muon momentum resolution is @xmath84 at @xmath85tev and @xmath86 at @xmath87gev .",
    "muons can be triggered on over the range @xmath88 .",
    "the cms detector is has calorimeters and tracking system are contained in a 4  tesla superconducting coil which provides the magnetic field for charged particle tracking .",
    "the tracking system is based on silicon pixels and silicon strip detectors .",
    "the charged track resolution is @xmath89 at @xmath85tev and @xmath90 at @xmath87gev .",
    "cms has chosen a precision electromagnetic calorimeter using lead tungstate ( pbw0@xmath91 ) crystals , covering @xmath77 ( with trigger coverage of @xmath92 ) .",
    "its resolution at low luminosity is @xmath93 .",
    "the surrounding hadronic calorimeter uses scintillator tiles in the barrel and endcaps ; its resolution for jets ( in combination with the electromagnetic calorimeter ) is @xmath94 .",
    "the region @xmath82 is covered by forward calorimeters using parallel - plate chambers or quartz fibers and having a resolution of about @xmath95 .",
    "muon trajectories outside the coil are measured in four layers of chambers ( drift tubes and csc s ) embedded in the iron return yoke .",
    "the muon momentum measurement using the muon chambers and the central tracker covers the range @xmath96 with a resolution @xmath89 at @xmath85tev and @xmath90 at @xmath87gev .",
    "the muon trigger extends over @xmath97 .",
    "we will use `` higgs bosons '' to refer to any scalar particles whose existence is connected to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "generically , higgs bosons couple most strongly to heavy particles .",
    "their production cross section in hadron colliders is small compared to qcd backgrounds , resulting in final states with low rates or low signal - to - background ratios .",
    "the ability to detect them and measure their mass provides a set of benchmarks by which detectors can be judged .",
    "a specific model is required in order to address the quantitative questions of how well the detector can perform . while one may not believe in the details of any particular model",
    ", a survey of them will enable general statements to be made about the potential of the lhc and its detectors .",
    "all the properties of the standard model higgs boson are determined once its mass is known ; the search strategy at lhc is therefore well defined .",
    "the current limit on the higgs mass from experiments at lep  @xcite is @xmath98 gev .",
    "there are several relevant production mechanisms at lhc ; @xmath99 via a heavy quark loop ; @xmath100 ; @xmath101 ; @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( `` @xmath39 fusion '' ) .",
    "the relative importance of these processes depends upon the higgs mass , the first dominates at small mass and the two become comparable for a higgs mass of 1 tev .",
    "the higgs branching ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ higgsbr ] .      at masses just above the range probed by lep , the dominant decay of the higgs boson is to @xmath105 , which is essentially impossible to separate from the huge qcd @xmath105 background .",
    "the decay to @xmath106 is the most promising channel in this region .",
    "the branching ratio is very small , and there is a large background from the pair production of photons via @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and the bremsstrahlung process @xmath109 .",
    "excellent photon energy resolution is required to observe this signal .",
    "hence , this process is one that drives the very high quality electromagnetic calorimetry of both atlas and cms .",
    "cms has a mass resolution of 540  ( 870 )  mev at @xmath110 for low ( high ) luminosity  @xcite .",
    "the mass resolution is worse at high luminosity due to event pile up .",
    "the atlas mass resolution at low ( high ) luminosity is 1.1  ( 1.3 )  gev for @xmath111 gev . the photon acceptance and identification efficiency are higher in the atlas analysis  @xcite , partly because cms rejects some of the photons that convert in the inner detector .",
    "in addition to the background from @xmath106 final states , there are @xmath112 and @xmath113 final states , that are much larger . a @xmath114 rejection factor of @xmath115 is needed to bring these backgrounds below the irreducible @xmath106 background .",
    "a detailed geant based study of the atlas detector has been performed for these backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "jets were rejected by applying cuts on the hadronic leakage , isolation and the measured width of the electromagnetic shower .",
    "these cuts result in an estimate of these backgrounds which is a factor of four below the irreducible @xmath106 background .",
    "there are uncertainties in the rates for these `` reducible '' backgrounds , however one can be confident that they are smaller after cuts than the irreducible @xmath106 background .    in the cms analysis for this process  @xcite ,",
    "two isolated photons are required , one with @xmath116 gev and the other with @xmath117 gev .",
    "both are required to satisfy @xmath118 and to have no track or additional electromagnetic energy cluster with @xmath119 in a cone of size @xmath120 around the photon direction .",
    "the higgs signal then appears as a peak over the smooth background .",
    "the signal - to - background ratio is small , but there are many events .",
    "a curve can be fitted to the smooth background and subtracted from data .",
    "4 shows the total and background - subtracted distributions for a higgs mass of @xmath121 . for an integrated luminosity of @xmath122 it is possible to discover a higgs using this mode if its mass is between the lower limit set by lep and about @xmath123",
    "a signal can also be found over a more limited mass range for an integrated luminosity of @xmath124 .",
    "results of the atlas study are similar  @xcite .",
    "another process is available at the lower end of the mass range .",
    "if the higgs is produced in association with a @xmath27 or @xmath125 , the cross section is substantially reduced , but the presence of additional particles provide a proportionally larger reduction in the background .",
    "events are required to have an isolated lepton arising from the decay of the @xmath27 ( or top quark ) .",
    "this lepton can be used to determine the vertex position .",
    "the process is only useful at high luminosity as , for @xmath126 @xmath127 , there are approximately 15 signal events for higgs masses between 90 and 120 gev ( the falling cross - section is compensated by the increased branching ratio for @xmath128 ) over an approximately equal background  @xcite",
    ". the process will therefore provide confirmation of a discovery made in the @xmath106 final state without an associated lepton and measurements of the couplings .",
    "the dominant decay of a higgs boson if its mass is below @xmath130 is to @xmath105 .",
    "the signal for a higgs boson produced in isolation is impossible to extract : there is no trigger for the process and the background production of @xmath105 pairs is enormous .",
    "the production of a higgs boson in association with a @xmath27 or @xmath125 pair can provide a high @xmath131 lepton that can be used as a trigger .",
    "a study was conducted by atlas of this very challenging channel ( see section of 19.2.4 of ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "events were triggered by requiring a muon ( electron ) with @xmath118 and @xmath132 gev .",
    "the expected @xmath19-tagging efficiency for atlas was determined by full simulation of samples of @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath125 events .",
    "the results from these samples for the @xmath19-tagging rate and rate of fake tags from non @xmath19-jets were obtained over a range of @xmath131 .",

    "the @xmath19-tagging efficiency for cms has similarly been determined from full simulation and is shown in figure  [ cmsbtag ] . as in the case of atlas",

    "if @xmath450 parity is conserved , then all susy decays contain a missing lsp , so no mass peaks can be reconstructed .",
    "kinematic endpoints of mass distributions have proved useful for a number of susy points in a variety of susy models  @xcite .",
    "the method seems fairly general : there is usually at least one distinctive mode  typically @xmath508 , @xmath509 , or @xmath510  from which to start .",
    "these can be combined with jets to determine other combinations of masses .",
    "the susy events will contain much more information than just endpoints like those described above .",
    "for example , while it is not possible to reconstruct @xmath511 decays in the same way because of the missing neutrino , one can get information about the chargino mass by studying @xmath512 and other distributions for 1-lepton events . cross sections and branching ratios",
    "can also be measured ; interpretation of these will be limited by the theoretical errors on the calculation of cross sections and acceptances . without real experimental data , it is difficult to assess such theoretical systematic errors .    this program will provide a large amount of information about gluinos , squarks , and their main decay products , including @xmath452 , @xmath471 , @xmath513 , and any sleptons that occur in their decays .",
    "the heavy gauginos typically have small cross sections , as do sleptons produced only by the drell - yan process .",
    "high precision measurements of the lsp mass and of couplings and branching ratios also appear more difficult .",
    "while the existing precision electroweak measurements are consistent with a light higgs boson , the possibility of electroweak symmetry breaking by new strong dynamics at the tev scale can not be excluded .",
    "the couplings of longitudinally polarized gauge bosons to each other are fixed at low energy by the nature of the spontaneously broken electroweak symmetry and are independent of the details of the breaking mechanism .",
    "scattering amplitudes calculated from these couplings will violate unitarity at center of mass energies of the @xmath39 system around 1.5 tev . new physics must enter to cure this problem . in the minimal standard model and its supersymmetric version , the cure arises from the weakly coupled higgs bosons . if no higgs - like particle exists , then new non - perturbative dynamics must enter in the scattering amplitudes for @xmath39 , @xmath514 and @xmath40 scattering at high energy .",
    "therefore , if no new physics shows up at lower mass scales , one must be able to probe @xmath515 scattering at @xmath516 .",
    "various models exist that can be used as benchmarks for this physics@xcite .",
    "the basic signal for all of these models is an excess of events over that predicted by the standard model for gauge boson pairs of large invariant mass . in certain models",
    "resonant structure can be seen ; an example of this is given in the next subsection .",
    "since in the standard model there is no process @xmath517 , the @xmath518 final state expected to have a much smaller background than the @xmath40 or @xmath519 ones .",

    "the remaining background of @xmath530 events is dominated by the @xmath531 processes .",
    "the signal rates vary between 35 and 9 events depending upon the model .",
    "the largest rate arises from a model where the @xmath39 scattering amplitude , which is known at small values of @xmath532 from low energy theorems , is extrapolated until it saturates unitarity and its growth is then cut off . the case of a 1 tev",

    "<S> this note summarizes many detailed physics studies done by the atlas and cms collaborations for the lhc , concentrating on processes involving the production of high mass states . </S>",
    "<S> these studies show that the lhc should be able to elucidate the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and to study a variety of other topics related to physics at the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a higgs boson with couplings given by the standard model is observable in several channels over the full range of allowed masses . </S>",
    "<S> its mass and some of its couplings will be determined . </S>",
    "<S> if supersymmetry is relevant to electroweak interactions , it will be discovered and the properties of many supersymmetric particles elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> other new physics , such as the existence of massive gauge bosons and extra dimensions can be searched for extending existing limits by an order of magnitude or more ianh / lhc ] . </S>"
