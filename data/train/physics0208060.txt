    "most finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) calculations solve the time - dependent maxwell equations using algorithms based on a proposal by yee  @xcite .",
    "the yee algorithm is flexible , fast and easy to implement .",
    "a limitation of yee - based fdtd techniques is that their stability is conditional , meaning that their numerical stability depends on the mesh size used for the spatial discretization and on the time step of the time integration  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the amount of computational work required to solve the time - dependent maxwell equations by present fdtd techniques  @xcite prohibits applications to a class of important fields such as bioelectromagnetics and vlsi design  @xcite .",
    "the basic reason for this is that the time step in the fdtd calculation has to be relatively small in order to maintain a reasonable degree of accuracy in the time integration .    in this paper",
    "we describe a one - step algorithm , based on chebyshev polynomial expansions  @xcite , to solve the time - dependent maxwell equations for arbitrarily long times .",
    "we demonstrate that the computational efficiency of this one - step algorithm can be orders of magnitude larger than of other fdtd techniques .",
    "we consider em fields in linear , isotropic , nondispersive and lossless materials .",
    "the time evolution of em fields in these systems is governed by the time - dependent maxwell equations  @xcite .",
    "some important physical symmetries of the maxwell equations can be made explicit by introducing the fields @xmath0 here , @xmath1 denotes the magnetic and @xmath2 the electric field vector , while @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote , respectively , the permeability and the permittivity . in the absence of electric charges , maxwell s curl equations  @xcite read @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the source of the electric field and @xmath7 denotes the operator @xmath8 writing @xmath9 it is easy to show that @xmath10 is skew symmetric , i.e. @xmath11 , with respect to the inner product @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the system s volume . in addition to eq.([tdmej ] ) , the em fields also satisfy @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a numerical algorithm that solves the time - dependent maxwell equations necessarily involves some discretization procedure of the spatial derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ tdmej ] ) .",
    "ideally , this procedure should not change the basic symmetries of the maxwell equations .",
    "we will not discuss the ( important ) technicalities of the spatial discretization ( we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite ) as this is not essential to the construction of the one - step algorithm .",
    "on a spatial grid maxwell s curl equations ( [ tdmej ] ) can be written in the compact form  @xcite @xmath16 the vector @xmath17 is a representation of @xmath18 on the grid .",
    "the matrix @xmath19 is the discrete analogue of the operator ( [ hconti ] ) , and the vector @xmath20 contains all the information on the current source @xmath21 .",
    "the formal solution of eq .",
    "( [ psij ] ) is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the time - evolution matrix .",
    "the underlying physical symmetries of the time - dependent maxwell equations are reflected by the fact that the matrix @xmath19 is real and skew symmetric  @xcite , implying that @xmath24 is orthogonal  @xcite .",
    "numerically , the time integration is carried out by using a time - evolution operator @xmath25 that is an approximation to @xmath23 .",
    "we denote the approximate solution by @xmath26 .",
    "first we use the chebyshev polynomial expansion to approximate @xmath24 and then show how to treat the source term in eq .",
    "( [ formalj ] ) .",
    "we begin by `` normalizing '' the matrix @xmath19 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the skew - symmetric matrix @xmath19 are pure imaginary numbers . in practice",
    "@xmath19 is sparse so it is easy to compute @xmath27 .",
    "then , by construction , the eigenvalues of @xmath28 all lie in the interval @xmath29 $ ]  @xcite . expanding the initial value @xmath30 in the ( unknown ) eigenvectors @xmath31 of @xmath32 , we find from eq .",
    "( [ formalj ] ) with @xmath33 : @xmath34 where the @xmath35 denote the ( unknown ) eigenvalues of @xmath32 .",
    "although there is no need to know the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath32 explicitly , the current mathematical justification of the chebyshev approach requires that @xmath32 is diagonalizable and that its eigenvalues are real .",
    "the effect of relaxing these conditions on the applicability of the chebyshev approach is left for future research .",
    "we find the chebyshev polynomial expansion of @xmath24 by computing the expansion coefficients of each of the functions @xmath36 that appear in eq .",
    "( [ expz ] ) .",
    "in particular , as @xmath37 , we can use the expansion  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the bessel function of integer order @xmath40 to write eq .",
    "( [ expz ] ) as @xmath41 \\bpsi(0)\\ , .",
    "\\label{sum0}\\ ] ] here , @xmath42 is the identity matrix and @xmath43 is a matrix - valued modified chebyshev polynomial that is defined by the recursion relations @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 . in practice",
    "we truncate the sum in eq .",
    "( [ sum0 ] ) , i.e. to obtain the approximation @xmath26 we will sum only the contributions with @xmath47 . as @xmath48 by construction and @xmath49 for @xmath50 real  @xcite , the resulting error vanishes exponentially fast for sufficiently large @xmath51 . in fig.[fig : jn ] we show a plot of @xmath52 as a function of @xmath53 to illustrate this point . from fig.[fig : jn ] it is clear that the chebyshev polynomial expansion will only be useful if @xmath51 lies to the right of the right - most extremum of @xmath52 . from numerical analysis",
    "it is known that for fixed @xmath51 , the chebyshev polynomial is very nearly the same polynomial as the minimax polynomial @xcite , i.e. the polynomial of degree @xmath51 that has the smallest maximum deviation from the true function , and is much more accurate than for instance a taylor expansion of the same degree @xmath51 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath54 should be calculated to high precision and the number @xmath51 is fixed by requiring that @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "here , @xmath57 is a control parameter that determines the accuracy of the approximation . for fixed @xmath57",
    ", @xmath51 increases linearly with @xmath58 ( there is no requirement on @xmath59 being small ) , a result that is essential for the efficiency of the algorithm . using the recursion relation of the bessel functions",
    ", all @xmath51 coefficients can be obtained with @xmath60 arithmetic operations @xcite .",
    "clearly this is a neglible contribution to the total computational cost for solving the maxwell equations .    performing one time step amounts to repeatedly using recursion ( [ cheb4 ] ) to obtain @xmath61 for @xmath62 , multiply the elements of this vector by @xmath54 and add all contributions .",
    "this procedure requires storage for two vectors of the same length as @xmath30 and some code to multiply such a vector by the sparse matrix @xmath19 .",
    "the result of performing one time step yields the solution at time @xmath59 , hence the name one - step algorithm .",
    "in contrast to what eqs .",
    "( [ cheb44 ] ) and  ( [ cheb4 ] ) might suggest , the algorithm does not require the use of complex arithmetic .",
    "we now turn to the treatment of the current source @xmath63 .",
    "the contribution of the source term to the em field at time @xmath59 is given by the last term in eq .",
    "( [ formalj ] ) .",
    "one approach might be to use the chebyshev expansion ( [ sum0 ] ) for @xmath64 and to perform the integral in eq .",
    "( [ formalj ] ) numerically .",
    "however that is not efficient as for each value of @xmath65 we would have to perform a recursion of the kind eq .",
    "( [ cheb4 ] ) .",
    "thus , it is better to adopt another strategy . for simplicity we only consider the case of a sinusoidal source @xmath66 where @xmath67 specifies the spatial distribution and",
    "@xmath68 the angular frequency of the source .",
    "the step function @xmath69 indicates that the source is turned on at @xmath70 and is switched off at @xmath71 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ source ] ) may be used to compose sources with a more complicated time dependence by a fourier sine transformation .",
    "the formal solution for the contribution of the sinusoidal source ( [ source ] ) reads @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 a vector of the same length as @xmath30 that represents the time - independent , spatial distribution @xmath67 .",
    "the coefficients of the chebyshev polynomial expansion of the formal solution ( [ formalc ] ) are calculated as follows .",
    "first we repeat the scaling procedure described above and substitute in eq .",
    "( [ formalc ] ) @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "then , we compute the ( fast ) fourier transform with respect to @xmath80 of the function @xmath81 ( which is non - singular on the interval @xmath82 ) . by construction , the fourier coefficients @xmath83 are the coefficients of the chebyshev polynomial expansion  @xcite .    taking into account all contributions of the source term with @xmath40 smaller than @xmath84 ( determined by a procedure similar to the one for @xmath51 ) , the one - step algorithm to compute the em fields at time @xmath59 reads @xmath85 \\bpsi(0)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left[s_0(t{\\vert h\\vert_1})i + 2\\sum_{k=1}^{k^\\prime } s_{k}(t{\\vert h\\vert_1 } ) \\widetilde t_{k}(b)\\right ] \\bxi\\ , .",
    "\\label{approxj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we emphasize that in our one - step approach the time dependence of the source is taken into account exactly , without actually sampling it .",
    "the following two examples illustrate the efficiency of the one - step algorithm .",
    "first we consider a system in vacuum ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) which is infinitely large in the @xmath88- and @xmath50-direction , hence effectively one dimensional .",
    "the current source ( [ source ] ) is placed at the center of a system of length 250.1 and oscillates with angular frequency @xmath89 during the time interval @xmath90  @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we present results of numerical experiments with two different time - integration algorithms . in general , the error of a solution @xmath91 as obtained by the fdtd algorithm of yee  @xcite or the unconditionally stable fdtd algorithm @xmath92  @xcite is defined by @xmath93 , where @xmath26 denotes the vector of the em fields as obtained by the one - step algorithm . the error on the yee - algorithm result vanishes as @xmath94 for sufficiently small @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "however , as table i shows , unless @xmath95 is made sufficiently small ( @xmath96 in this example ) , the presence of the source term changes the quadratic behavior to almost linear .",
    "the rigorous bound on the error between the exact and @xmath92 results tells us that this error should vanish as @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "this knowledge can be exploited to test if the one - step algorithm yields the exact numerical answer . using the triangle inequality we can write @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a positive constant  @xcite .",
    "the numerical data in table  [ tab1 ] ( third column ) show that @xmath100 as @xmath97 and , therefore , we can be confident that the one - step algorithm yields the correct answer within rounding errors . furthermore , since the results of the one - step algorithm are exact within almost machine precision , in general the solution also satisfies @xmath14 and @xmath15 within the same precision .",
    "this high precision also allows us to use the one - step algorithm for genuine time stepping with arbitrarily large time steps , this in spite of the fact that strictly speaking , the one - step algorithm is not unconditionally stable .    from table  [ tab1 ]",
    "it follows that if one finds an error of more than 2.5% acceptable , one could use the yee algorithm , though we recommend to use the one - step algorithm because then the time - integration error is neglegible .",
    "the yee algorithm is no competition for the @xmath92 algorithm if one requires an error of less than 1% , but the @xmath92 algorithm is not nearly as efficient as the one - step algorithm with respect to the number of required matrix - vector operations .",
    "a more general quantitative analysis of the efficiency can be made using the fact that for an @xmath53th - order algorithm ( @xmath101 for the yee algorithm and @xmath102 for the @xmath92 algorithm ) , the error @xmath103 vanishes no faster with @xmath95 than @xmath104 .",
    "each time step takes a number @xmath105 of matrix - vector operations ( of the type @xmath106 ) , e.g. for a three - dimensional system we have @xmath107 and @xmath108 for the yee algorithm and the @xmath92 algorithm , respectively . in practice",
    "the actual number of floating point operations carried out by our algorithms agrees with these estimates . the total number of matrix - vector operations it takes to obtain the solution at a reference time @xmath109 with error @xmath110 is then given by @xmath111 and thus @xmath112",
    ". the number of operations @xmath113 that it will take to compute the em fields at time @xmath59 with accuracy @xmath103 is then calculated from @xmath114 we note that one numerical reference experiment per @xmath53th - order algorithm is sufficient to determine the parameters @xmath115 , @xmath110 , and @xmath109 . while these parameters may be different for different systems , the scaling of @xmath113 with @xmath116 and with @xmath117 , respectively , for second- and fourth - order algorithms , will not be affected .",
    "most importantly , since the number of matrix - vector operations required by the one - step algorithm scales linearly with @xmath59 , it is clear that for long enough times @xmath59 , the one - step algorithm will be orders of magnitude more efficient than the current fdtd methods . in fig.[scalingplot ] we show the required number of operations as a function of time @xmath59 taking , as an example , simulation data of 3d systems ( discussed below ) to fix the parameters @xmath115 , @xmath110 , and @xmath109 .",
    "we conclude that for longer times none of the fdtd algorithms can compete with the one - step algorithm in terms of efficiency . for @xmath118 ,",
    "the one - step algorithm is a factor of ten faster than the yee algorithm .",
    "thereby we have disregarded the fact that the yee algorithm yields results within an error of 0.1% while the one - step algorithm gives the numerically exact solution .    as the second example we use the one - step algorithm to compute the frequency spectrum of a three - dimensional photonic woodpile  @xcite .",
    "this structure , shown in the inset of fig .  [ woodpile ] , possesses a large infrared bandgap and is under current experimental and theoretical investigation  @xcite . to determine all eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix @xmath19 we follow the procedure described in refs .",
    "we use random numbers to initialize the elements of the vector @xmath119 .",
    "then we calculate the inner product @xmath120 as a function of @xmath59 and average @xmath121 over several realizations of the initial vector @xmath119 .",
    "the full eigenmode distribution , @xmath122 , is obtained by fourier transformation of @xmath123 . in fig .",
    "[ woodpile ] we show @xmath122 , as obtained by @xmath92 and the one - step algorithm , with a time step @xmath124 ( set by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath19 ) , a mesh size @xmath125 , and 8192 time steps . for this choice of parameters ,",
    "the yee algorithm would be unstable  @xcite and would yield meaningless results .",
    "the @xmath92 calculation shows a peak at @xmath126 .",
    "this reflects the fact that , in a strict sense , the @xmath92 algorithm does not conserve @xmath127 and @xmath128  @xcite . however , the peak at @xmath126 vanishes as @xmath97 . repeating the @xmath92 calculation with @xmath129 yields a @xmath122 ( not shown ) that is on top of the result of the one - step algorithm ( see fig .  [ woodpile ] ) and is in good agreement with band - structure calculations  @xcite . for @xmath129",
    "the one - step algorithm is 3.5 times more efficient than @xmath92 .",
    "note that in this example , the one - step algorithm is used for a purpose for which it is least efficient ( time - stepping with relatively small time steps ) .",
    "nevertheless the gain in efficiency is still substantial . in simulations of the scattering of the em fields from the same woodpile",
    "( results not shown ) , the one - step algorithm is one to two orders of magnitude more efficient than current fdtd algorithms , in full agreement with the error scaling analysis given above .",
    "we have described a one - step algorithm , based on the chebyshev polynomial expansions , to solve the time - dependent maxwell equations with spatially varying permittivity and permeability and current sources . in practice",
    "this algorithm is as easy to implement as fdtd algorithms .",
    "our error scaling analysis shows and our numerical experiments confirm that for long times the one - step algorithm can be orders of magnitude more efficient than current fdtd algorithms .",
