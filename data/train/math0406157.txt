    "our main result is the following theorem .",

    "it seems that the structure of the graph is what keeps its threshold small .",
    "let us consider a particular configuration of pebbles on the cartesian product of cliques @xmath106 . note that this graph can be thought of as a rectangular grid with each row and column a complete graph .",
    "therefore , to pebble to a specific root @xmath8 one needs to collect two or more pebbles on any vertex that belongs to the _ row _",
    "@xmath107 or to the _ column _ @xmath108 ( see figure [ cliquebyclique ] ) .",
    "this suggests the following interpretation of the pebbling problem .",
    "we partition the vertices of @xmath109 into three distinct sets : _",
    "police _ , or _ cops _ ( @xmath110 ) , _ citizens _ ( @xmath111 ) and _ robbers _ ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "vertices in the set @xmath110 are those with two or more pebbles on them , @xmath111 is the set of vertices with one pebble , and @xmath112 is the remaining set of empty vertices .",
    "( this approach is motivated by a variety `` cops and robbers '' games , one of the more prevalent types of games on graphs .",
    "more information on these types of games can be found , for example , in @xcite . )    in our case , the robber is immobile and cops can move only in certain directions and their number may change during the game . if root @xmath8 is chosen in @xmath112 then for a pebbling configuration to be solvable it is sufficient that there is at least one cop on @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "any citizen can become a cop if it is possible to move at least one pebble to it from some other cop .",
    "we say that vertex @xmath5 _ sees _ @xmath6",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are in the same row or column of @xmath113 furthermore , we say that a robber @xmath114 can be _ caught _ if there is a sequence of citizens @xmath115 and a cop @xmath116 so that @xmath117 sees @xmath118 for @xmath119 then the pebbling configuration is @xmath8-solvable if a vertex @xmath8 can be caught .",
    "for example , on figure [ policepath ] it is possible to pebble from the vertex @xmath33 ( cop ) to the vertex @xmath8 ( robber ) .",
    "any pebbling configuration @xmath2 determines the _ _ citizen subgraph  _ _ @xmath120 of @xmath109 induced by the vertex set @xmath121 the edge set of @xmath120 is determined by the vertices that see each other .",
    "any component of @xmath120 containing two or more cops we call a _ police component . _    [ claimpolicecomp ] any configuration whose citizen subgraph has a police component is solvable .",
    "let us consider a police component with vertices @xmath122 such that @xmath123 @xmath124 and @xmath125 sees @xmath117 for @xmath126 .",
    "we now use the following strategy . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath127 and @xmath128 are in the same row @xmath129 .",
    "then we find vertex @xmath130 which is the intersection of @xmath108 and @xmath129 and make @xmath131 a citizen by moving a pebble from @xmath127 .",
    "now @xmath132 can be caught by @xmath133 .",
    "@xmath134    another sufficient condition for a pebbling configuration to be solvable is the existence of a `` robocop '' , a vertex with @xmath135 or more pebbles on it . in that case",
    "any robber @xmath8 can be caught by sending two pebbles to either @xmath108 or @xmath107 , making a cop there and moving a pebble to @xmath8 from this new cop . in section [ comps ]",
    "we prove that the probability that such a `` robocop '' exists tends to zero .",
    "hence , our goal is to prove that almost every configuration of asymptotically more than @xmath1 pebbles on @xmath109 has a police component .",
    "the next argument transforms the original problem of the solvability of a pebbling configuration on @xmath136 to connectedness properties of a related bipartite multigraph @xmath137 .",
    "first , we observe that @xmath109 is isomorphic to the line graph of the complete bipartite graph @xmath138 . indeed ,",
    "both vertex sets are isomorphic to @xmath139 , and both edge sets are isomorphic to pairs from @xmath139 that share a coordinate .",
    "similarly we construct a bipartite graph @xmath140 whose line graph is isomorphic to @xmath120 .",
    "the bipartite multigraph @xmath137 is constructed from @xmath140 by adding multiple edges according to the multiplicity of pebbles on the vertices of @xmath120 . in other words , for every vertex @xmath141 we place the edge @xmath142 with multiplicity @xmath143 .",
    "in this section we describe three different models for random bipartite graphs and multigraphs .",
    "we compare them and determine asymptotic implications from one to another which we can apply then to the pebbling threshold on the product of graphs .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in the property of having a large component ( which will be shown to be a police component almost surely ) .",
    "the first model ( model a ) is an analogue of the probabilistic model for random graphs . in model",
    "a edges between any two vertices in different parts of @xmath140 are mutually independent and have the same probability @xmath144 .",
    "computations are easiest in this model , in which all graphs are simple . the probability space corresponding to model a we denote by @xmath145 .",
    "the second model ( model b ) is an analogue of the static model for random graphs .",

    "as it was defined in the previous section , the edges of the line graph represent pebbles ; therefore we need a multiple edge model to reflect this situation .",
