    "density matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) methods play an important role in numerical studies of one - dimensional quantum lattice models allowing to access their low - energy properties with a very high precision.@xcite recently , these powerful techniques have also been successfully applied to nonequilibrium problems in strongly - interacting quantum systems such as dynamics of quantum quenches @xcite and tunneling of electrons through quantum point contacts.@xcite a considerable theoretical effort has been put into development of similar methods for two - dimensional quantum lattice models , see for example refs . @xcite and @xcite these new numerical techniques make use of the recent advances in understanding entanglement properties of many - particle quantum systems in finding the optimal basis for the representation of the ground state and low - lying excitations .",
    "this is usually implemented by using matrix - product states or tensor networks .",

    "these calculations showed a potential of the method in finite - size numerical studies of quantum hall systems .",
    "a standard approach in fqhe is exact diagonalization which has been very fruitful in identifying states of interacting electrons with different filling fractions and studying excitation spectra in these states .",
    "however , in some of the systems of current theoretical and experimental interest , exact diagonalization has almost reached its limits because of the exponential growth of hilbert - space dimension with the system size .",
    "there are many examples where a new method would be beneficial , such as qhe systems with spin degrees of freedom and double - layer configurations , studies of higher filling fractions when several landau levels are occupied as well as problems related to nonequilibrium dynamics of electrons in quantum hall edge states which are still far from being well understood , see for example ref.@xcite    recent advances in experiments with cold atomic gases allow to study systems of neutral particles , both fermions and bosons , under rotation , which is equivalent to having a coupling to a magnetic field in the rotating frame .",

    "it is well - known that dmrg works better in systems with short - range interactions , however there are successful applications of the method to calculations for strips of finite width.@xcite moreover in the case of quantum hall effect in a cylinder geometry the matrix elements of interactions between different momentum eigenstates are exponentially suppressed at large transferred momenta .",

    "let us consider a system of neutral bosonic atoms , which are strongly confined in the @xmath2 direction by an external trapping potential with the frequency @xmath3 such that the bosons are in the ground state of the harmonic well .",
    "in this limit the system becomes essentially two - dimensional in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "the bosons are confined in this plane by an additional harmonic trapping potential @xmath5 , with @xmath6 which rotates around the @xmath2 axis with a frequency @xmath7 .",

    "it allows to calculate various quantum mechanical observables such as energies , correlation functions , etc . for the ground and a few excited states of the systems with short - range interactions with an extremely high precision . in the following",
    "we will extend the standard dmrg approach to study systems of rotating _ bosons _ described by the projected to the lowest landau level hamiltonian ( [ ham_magn ] ) .",

    "there are two main versions of the algorithm i.e. the finite size and the infinite size methods.@xcite to achieve best results one usually starts with the infinite size approach and correct it afterwards by implementing finite size sweeps . in our case because of the bosonic statistics particle occupation numbers can be large , moreover one has to impose constraints on the total number of particles and the total momentum , which makes it difficult to use standard methods and we have to implement a different approach which is presented below .",

    "after diagonalizing the hamiltonian in all the subspaces , we project it in every subspace together with the matrices corresponding to the matrix elements of the operators @xmath83 between allowed bra and ket subspaces , onto the lowest energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian . in the calculations we take up to four states in every subspace . after projection",

    "we use the eigenstates of this hamiltonian to calculate the density matrix for the left or right part of the system by tracing out the coordinates of the remaining part in every subspace of quantum numbers .",
    "after diagonalizing the density matrix we generate a matrix of the eigenvectors with highest eigenvalues adding the extra eigenvectors if necessary to have at least one eigenvector in every subspace .",
    "we fix the maximum number of eigenvectors or select the ones which eigenvalues are greater than some small number @xmath98 . in our calculations",

    "the maximum dimension of the hamiltonian matrix which we diagonalized during dmrg sweeps was of the order of @xmath101 .",
    "we also implemented single site corrections in the dmrg algorithm , which had been proposed by white in ref.@xcite , by admixing information from the hamiltonian to the density matrix .",
    "this is necessary because the interactions in the projected hamiltonian are not short - range .",
    "these corrections improve the convergence by a considerable amount .",
    "although in our calculations we used a version of the algorithm with a single central site , it is possible to extend it to two or more sites . however",

    "this state has a bulk gap and gapless edge states .",
    "when the interaction strength is decreased , the gap should close and there has to be be a phase transition at intermediate values of interactions .",
    "notice that in the narrow channel the system area is increased with increasing interaction strength as bosons repel each other , which leads to the increase in the number of flux quanta penetrating the system and decrease in the effective filling fraction @xmath29.@xcite    here we calculate a few phases starting from very large interactions . the results for the integrated over @xmath35 particle density @xmath103 , which is given by the equation @xmath104 where @xmath105 , are presented in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
