    "in fact , in addition to representing the first experimental realization of a squid analog with a bose - einstein condensate @xcite , such experiments show a critical barrier velocity above which atoms become compressed on one side and expanded on the other side , in close analogy to the transition from dc to ac josephson effects .",

    "[ figu8 ] to the transition from black circles to red stars .    the increasing discrepancies between the gp simulation results and those of the smmb above certain asymmetry shown in fig .",

    "the values are given in nk except for the particle imbalance @xmath36 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table ]    a first attempt to quantify the extent to which such an approximation could affect the smmb results , can be evaluated by appreciating the differences in the value of the etm model parameters in table [ table ] with respect to those of the symmetric case .",
    "note that the only nonvanishing parameters of the symmetric configuration are those of the smmb , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , and the neglected parameter @xmath126 . on the other hand , although all the remaining parameters become finite for asymmetric configurations , for @xmath184 only a little effect of such asymmetries on the smmb accuracy should be expected to occur since , @xmath185 and @xmath186 vary less than 10 % , we have @xmath187 , and @xmath188 ( cf .",
    "( [ min ] ) ) is well fulfilled in table [ table ] .",
    "this explains the good agreement between gp and smmb results observed in fig .",
    "[ figu8 ] and also the agreement with experimental data reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , the simplest improvement to the smmb in order to take into account the evolving trap configuration may be provided by an immediate generalization of the etm model with its parameters depending on the instantaneous trap asymmetry , i.e. , for a time - dependent @xmath87 .     calculated from gp simulation results ( black dots ) , from the etm model , @xmath189 ( yellow stars ) , and from the smmb , @xmath190 ( blue solid line ) .",
    "the barrier velocity corresponds to @xmath145 hz . ]    to test such a possibility in the dbp regime , we depict in figs .",
    "[ figu9 ] and [ figu10 ] the derivatives of imbalance and phase difference as functions of time arising from gp simulations for @xmath145 hz , and compare such results with those given by the smmb , and with the corresponding values arising from the etm equations ( [ imbe])-([phaseemo ] ) for a variable ( time - dependent ) @xmath87 with @xmath26 and @xmath117 taken from the gp simulation results",
    ". then we may observe in fig .",
    "[ figu9 ] that the smmb prediction for the imbalance derivative ( blue solid line ) shows an increasing departure from the gp results for @xmath87 above 0.15 @xmath155 . on the other hand , the results arising from the etm model ( yellow stars ) show a better agreement with the gp simulation values for the whole time evolution .",
    "calculated from gp simulation results ( black dots ) , from the etm model , @xmath191 ( yellow stars ) , from the plain tm model , @xmath192 ( red circles ) , and from the smmb , @xmath193 ( blue solid line ) .",
    "the barrier velocity corresponds to @xmath145 hz . ]    as regards the calculations of the phase derivative , first we want to remark that we have found that the hopping terms ( terms in @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath126 , and @xmath196 ) in the equations ( [ phasee ] ) for tm , ( [ phaseemo ] ) for etm , and ( [ sphasee ] ) of the smmb turn out to be all negligible with respect to the on - site energy dependent terms , so we have disregarded their contribution in the calculations corresponding to fig .",
    "[ figu10 ] .",
    "thus , again one finds that the smmb results increasingly differ from the gp results for @xmath87 above 0.15 @xmath155 , and also that the etm calculation clearly improves the agreement with the simulation results .",
    "in addition , it is possible in this case to test the accuracy of the etm model results versus those of the plain tm model , as observed in fig .",
    "[ figu10 ] .",
    "we have developed a two - mode model of a bose - einstein condensate in an asymmetric double - well .",
    "taking into account effective interaction effects as proposed previously for symmetric configurations , we have introduced corrections to such a model in order to improve the agreement with simulation results .",
    "thus , we applied this formalism to a recently explored experimental setting of a toroidal trap split into an asymmetric double - well condensate by means of a pair of radial barriers .",
    "we have found that the qualitative agreement with the gp simulation results arising from the plain asymmetric tm model , became enhanced to the extent of an excellent concordance when the effective interaction effects were considered , for practically the whole range of asymmetric configurations .",
    "we have explored the range of validity of the simplest theoretical model for moving barriers , previously utilized to describe experimental results , finding that it should fail for larger departures from the symmetric configuration than those considered in the experiment , and also for the running - phase regime of higher barrier frequencies .",
    "finally , we have performed an analysis of a possible improvement of this model , which consists in an immediate generalization of the asymmetric etm model to a moving - barrier configuration , simply by employing parameters depending on the instantaneous trap asymmetry .",
    "our results obtained for the dbp regime pave the way for further studying more complex dynamics driven by different kinds of barrier movements .",
    "the tm model parameters read ,                    we note that according to the definitions ( [ a ] ) and ( [ ua ] ) , @xmath63 and @xmath62 turn out to be on - site energy dependent parameters , as they are built from the on - site energy parameters @xmath205 and @xmath206 . on the other hand , @xmath207 is the standard hopping coefficient , while the remaining hopping parameters @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath126 have been first introduced by ananikian and bergeman in ref .",
    "particularly , @xmath210 and @xmath211 can be interpreted as additional contributions to the tunnelling obtained from a modified hamiltonian that includes the interaction term as an effective potential @xcite .",
    "we remark that in both references the authors assume symmetric traps with @xmath212 , a parameter which in our case would only contribute to the hopping parameter @xmath194 ( [ ja ] ) . on the other hand , in an asymmetric trap",
    ", the difference between @xmath213 and @xmath214 gives rise to the additional hopping parameter @xmath195 ( [ jb ] ) .",
    "as regards the parameter @xmath126 , it corresponds to atom - pair tunnelling processes and , although it turns out to be in most cases negligible , it was recently shown that for enough strong interaction regimes a quantum phase transition driven by such atom - pair tunnelling events should be expected to take place @xcite .",
