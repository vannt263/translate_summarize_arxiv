    "shock fronts or shock waves occur when disturbances in a medium propagate faster than the local speed of sound .",
    "shocks are characterized by nearly discontinuous changes in the characteristics of the medium , like pressure , temperature , energy etc .",
    "the width of the discontinuity is quite infinitesimal in comparison to the actual system , and therefore it is assumed to be a single propagating front .",
    "the relativistic magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) theory of shock waves is being applied to problems of cosmology and relativistic heavy - ion collisions . in the field of cosmology",
    "the shock waves are usually collision - less mhd shocks and are thought to be mostly responsible for the acceleration of particles in a variety of astrophysical objects ranging from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to gamma ray bursts ( grb ) ( known as first - order fermi acceleration or diffusive shock acceleration ) .",
    "this phenomenon occurs when the charged particles in the plasma interact with the magnetic fields in the shock layers , and are repeatedly transported back and forth across the shock and thereby gaining energy .",
    "the generation of such collision - less shocks have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the commonly observed earth bow shock indicate that the velocity anisotropic distributions ( vad ) of the particles play an important role in the shock formation .",
    "observation with the new generation of air cherenkov tev @xmath0-ray telescopes such as hess , magic and veritas @xcite have established the fact that agns , microquasars and pulsar wind nebulae are powerful sources of high - energy photon radiation .",
    "they generate relativistic jets of particles , which collide with the surrounding intergalactic and interstellar medium to give rise to high energy tev @xmath0 radiation .",
    "this is the currently accepted hypothesis .",
    "however , how the collision - less shock is generated is still not well understood .",
    "shock waves are usually created under rapid compression of matter . however , a similar discontinuity in matter can also be generated if the system suddenly expands and there is a phase transition ( pt ) @xcite .",
    "taub was the earliest one to study the relativistic hydrodynamic shocks , by writing the conservation equation across the shock boundary also called rankine - hugoniot equation .",
    "de hoffmann and teller were first to study the magnetized shock @xcite .",
    "this led the way for the study of mhd shocks for the following years @xcite .",
    "lichnerowicz extended the analysis to the relativistic case @xcite , where he treated the matter to be an ideal fluid with an infinite conductivity .",
    "the more recent important studies of mhd shocks @xcite used relativistic equation of state to obtain the solutions from the conservation condition .",
    "the conservation condition of mhd shocks in a gyrotropic fluid has also been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several studies of mhd shocks , the first - order fermi acceleration and its connection with the astrophysical observation have also been performed @xcite .",
    "in the above mentioned astrophysical scenarios , the shock wave propagates with a velocity less than the velocity of light .",
    "that is , the normal vector of the surface of the discontinuity , is space - like .",
    "however , it may not always be the case . in some situations there",
    "may be a fast pt ( first order ) where the normal vector to the surface of the discontinuity can be time - like @xcite .",
    "a system undergoing rapid and homogeneous rarefaction , bubbles at different spatial points are formed which are causally unconnected to each other .",
    "for such cases the phase boundary separating the two phases of matter becomes time - like .",
    "if the thickness of the time - like surface depends on the rate of formation of the bubbles and its growth , and if it is sufficiently thin , we can assume that the pt happens along an approximate structureless time - like surface .",
    "an example of such type of pt is the hadronization of a supercooled quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in a heavy - ion collision .",
    "as the qgp fireball expands , it cools , and well below critical temperature the qgp hadronizes .",
    "the time - like shock hadronization in connection with heavy - ion collision has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the inflationary universe model can be thought to be a cosmological example .",
    "the main aim of this work is to study both the space - like and time - like shock in a relativistic mhd formalism . in our specific calculation",
    ", we assume that the shock converts hadronic matter to quark matter , and so the shock has on one side hadronic matter and on the other side quark matter .",
    "we treat the shock as a generalised oblique shock both in the de hoffmann teller frame and normal incidence frame .",
    "such shock studies can be important both to the study of shocks in astrophysics and in heavy - ion collisions . in the astrophysical scenario",
    "such shock and pt can occur in neutron stars which have huge inner magnetic fields . on the other hand , in the field of heavy - ion collisions such scenario can also occur when extremely large magnetic field are generated by colliding particles . in the next section",
    "we write the conservation equations for the time - like and space - like shock front in the de hoffmann frame . in section",
    "iii we give the transformation equation from the fluid frame to the normal incidence frame . in section",
    "iv we present our results . in the final section ( section v )",
    "we discuss our results and their applicability .",
    "we denote the surface of discontinuity as @xmath1 and the normal to the surface as @xmath2 .",
    "the normalization condition is given as @xmath3    the energy momentum tensor of the system reads @xmath4 where , @xmath5 is the enthalpy ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 being the energy density and @xmath8 being the pressure . @xmath9",
    "is the 4-velocity of the fluid , and is normalized such that @xmath10 and @xmath0 is the lorentz factor .",
    "@xmath11 is the metric tensor and is @xmath12 using the flat space - time convention .",
    "the conservation conditions are nothing but the energy - momentum and baryon number conservation laws , across the discontinuity of the shock surface .",
    "we denote @xmath13 as the initial state ahead of the shock front and @xmath14 as the final state behind the shock .",
    "the general derivation of the shock wave can be found in @xcite and also in many subsequent literature @xcite .",
    "one of the other important constraints of the transition is the thermodynamic stability condition , which requires non - decreasing entropy @xcite @xmath15 where , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the entropy densities before and after the shock .",
    "the generalised conservation conditions can be written as @xmath18    the relativistic conservation conditions for the space - like ( sl ) and time - like ( tl ) shocks are derived from the above generalised equations . closely following ref .",
    "@xcite , the equation reads    \\a .",
    "space - like @xmath19    solving the equations we get the solution of the downstream and upstream velocities , which are @xmath20    \\b .",
    "time - like @xmath21    the corresponding downstream and upstream velocities are @xmath22    comparing the matter velocities for the tl and sl shocks , we arrive at the equation @xmath23 where , @xmath24 stands for tl shocks and @xmath25 for sl shocks , respectively .",
    "next , we address the conservation equation for the mhd shocks . in this case",
    ", the energy - momentum tensor has both matter and magnetic contributions .",
    "we assume an ideal infinitely conducting fluid , therefore the electric field vanishes .",
    "the total energy momentum tensor is given by @xmath26 the @xmath27 represents the matter part of the tensor and @xmath28 the magnetic part .",
    "the magnetic part of the tensor is defined as @xmath29 where , @xmath30 is the magnetic field vector .",
    "the shock conservation condition or the relativistic rankine - hugoniot condition is very difficult to solve for the mhd shocks . to make it more manageable we go to the de hoffmann teller frame ( ht ) @xcite . the ht frame is the shock rest frame , where there is no @xmath31 drift electric fields .",
    "therefore , for the subluminal flows the ht frame is an obvious choice where the conservation conditions are reduced to simple forms .",
    "the system of equations are then transformed from the ht frame to normal incidence ( ni ) frame , with a boost .",
    "the ni frame is a frame where the incident velocity is normal to the shock front .",
    "[ fig1 ] gives the pictorial description of the two frames .",
    "we then have a system of simple simultaneous equations in which the imaginary terms in the superluminal shocks are absent . here",
    "we should mention that our approach of this frame transformation is similar to the one used by ballard & heavens and summerlin & baring @xcite .    in this work",
    "we adopt the following conventions : the ht frame quantities do not have any subscript , whereas the ni frame quantities are labelled by a subscript @xmath25 .",
    "the angle between the magnetic field and the shock normal in the ht frame is denoted by @xmath32 and that in the ni frame by @xmath33 .",
    "correspondingly , the angle between flow velocities and the shock normal is denoted by @xmath34 for the ht frame and by @xmath35 in the ni frame . along with the system of conservation equations we have also a set of equations of state ( eos ) describing the matter phases in the upstream and downstream .",
    "we also assume that in the ht frame the fluid flows along the magnetic lines and there is no @xmath31 electric fields .",
    "the four matter jump conditions are given by the conservation of baryon number , momentum ( 2 components ) and energy density across the front .",
    "the electromagnetic jump condition is given by the equation @xmath36 the last term arises trivially because @xmath37 holds everywhere .",
    "thus we define the oblique shock conservation condition .",
    "first we write the conservation condition in the ht frame . in this frame the magnetic field and the matter velocities are aligned .",
    "let us assume that the @xmath38-direction defines the normal to the shock plane .",
    "the magnetic field is constant and lies in the @xmath39 plane .",
    "therefore the velocities in the @xmath38 and @xmath40 direction are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "similarly the magnetic fields in the @xmath38 and @xmath40 direction are given by @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the lorentz factor is defined as @xmath45    with that the conservation conditions follow .",
    "space - like @xmath46    \\b .",
    "time - like @xmath47    for the ht frame we also have @xmath48 with the assumption of infinite conductivity , the electric field is zero .",
    "the maxwell equation @xmath49 , defines that there are no monopoles and so we have @xmath50    0.2 in    cc             +    however , this equations are valid only for subluminal flows . for broader applicability ( including superluminal flows ) , we now transform the equations to the ni frame .",
    "as done by summelin & baring and kirk & heavens @xcite , we arrive from the local fluid frame to the ni frame by a boost of @xmath51 along the @xmath38 direction and from the ni frame to the ht frame by a boost of @xmath52 in the @xmath40 direction .",
    "the shock planes of the ht and ni frames are coincident .    in the ni frame ,",

    "some perturbation ( like spin - down @xcite ) may induce such a pt brought about by a shock wave , originating at the centre .",
    "if such is the case , then a detailed study of shock waves inside the star is needed .",
    "the first step towards it is the study of mhd shock waves in those environments .",
    "here we study such a scenario where a mhd shock wave ( both sl and tl ) brings about a pt from hadronic to quark matter .",
    "we find that the sl and tl mhd shock waves are quite different from one another .",
    "the downstream flow velocity vectors for sl shocks points in opposite direction ( i.e. the flow angle has opposite signs ) in comparison to the tl shocks .",
    "the velocity compression ratio is also typically different . and",
    "the most significant difference comes from the magnetic effect . for the sl shocks all the downstream components depends strongly on the magnetic field and its angle with respect to the shock",
    "whereas , tl shocks are unaffected by magnetic field . the difference in the downstream behaviour of matter variables for sl and",
    "tl shocks could have some observational consequences for ns .",
    "the observed pulses from the ns are the jets of particles emitted by the ns and are directly in our line of sight .",
    "the jets of particles interacts with the ns environment surrounding it . also , it was suggested @xcite that gamma ray bursts ( grb ) can be a consequence of pt in ns .",
    "therefore , if the pt is brought about by a shock wave , its signature may differ for sl and tl shocks and could be strongly dependent on the magnetic field involved .",
    "it is suggested that the particle acceleration and production of high energy ( tev ) @xmath0-rays from blazars and agns depends on the nature of the shock environment , the shock speed and the magnetic field present there .",
    "the spectral indices which are measured depends strongly on these parameters , and provide deep insight regarding blazars and grb s .",
    "this may be also true for shock waves in ns , where the downstream flow variables for sl and tl shocks are quite different .",
    "for more significant observational inferences , we need more detailed calculation of the particle emission , their acceleration and their interaction with the ns environment . in heavy - ion collision ,",
    "the pt is quite the opposite .",
    "there we have hadronization of particles from an expanding and subsequently cooling qgp fireball .",
    "the pt can also be thought to be initiated by a shock wave .",
    "although , in our work we analyse the opposite pt , the results can provide a insight even for heavy - ion collision , for the fact that the magnetic field which are produced in heavy - ion collisions would have no effect on the tl shock whereas it would significantly affect the sl shocks .",
    "we should mention that the transformation equations from the fluid to the ni frame are similar to ballard & heavens and summerlin & baring ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have solved the rankine - hugoniot condition for the mhd fluid with the assumption that there is a pt from hadronic to quark matter .",
    "there is no temporal evolution . to look into the temporal evolution or how shock waves bring about a pt in neutron stars we have to study and solve the corresponding equations of motion ( the continuity and euler equation )",
    "however , before tackling such complex problems we can guess the initial conditions from this work .",
    "therefore , these results can serve as the starting point of such calculations which we hope to report upon in the future work .",
