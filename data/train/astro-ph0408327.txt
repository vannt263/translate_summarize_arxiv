    "so far , water megamasers have been detected in radio - quiet active galactic nuclei ( agn ; for a definition of radio - quiet agn , see e.g.  ) , mostly in seyfert2 and liner galaxies . under the assumption that all megamasers are associated with molecular material orbiting around the central engine ( e.  g.  ) or interacting with the nuclear jet(s ) of the host galaxy ( e.  g.  ) and that their amplification is unsaturated ( i.e. the maser intensity grows linearly with the background radio continuum )",
    ", one should expect a much higher detection rate in radio - loud agn than is actually observed .",
    "this fact should be especially true for the radio - loud agn classified as narrow - lined friis for which the agn unification scheme ( e.g.  ) requires the presence of geometrically and optically thick obscuring structure .",
    "samples of radio galaxies belonging to the broad - lined and narrow - lined frii class have been recently observed with the effelsberg telescope ( tarchi et al .",
    ", in prep ; lara et al . , priv .  comm . ) .",
    "as in the case of fris @xcite , no maser detections have been obtained .",
    "our sample comprises all nearby ( @xmath7 ) 3 friis spectrally classified as high excitation galaxies ( hegs , ) with nuclear equivalent widths of the [ oiii]@xmath85007 emission line ew([oiii])@xmath9  ( fig.[chiab ] ) . a high value for the nuclear ew([oiii ] ) in hegs has been interpreted as a hint for the obscuration of the central ionizing continuum source @xcite . in these sources the nuclear ionizing continuum would be obscured to our line - of - sight and only a small fraction of the emission is seen through scattered light .",
    "therefore , our selection criteria provide us with a sample of galaxies with both high radio flux densities and nuclear obscuration of the central ionizing source .",
    "emission line , measured with respect to the central compact core emission , is plotted vs. the ratio between the optical central compact core to radio core flux ( for details , see also chiaberge et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "leg : low excitation galaxy ; heg : high excitation galaxy .",
    "the targets of our sample with their respective names are those within circles . ]",
    "observations of the @xmath10 transition of h@xmath11o ( rest frequency : 22.235 ghz ) were carried out with the 100-m telescope of the mpifr at effelsberg in january and march 2003 . the beam width ( hpbw ) was 40@xmath5 .",
    "flux calibration was obtained by measuring w3(oh ) ( see ) .",
    "gain variations of the telescope as a function of elevation were taken into account ( eq.1 of ) .",
    "the pointing accuracy was better than 10@xmath5 .",
    "the follow - up vla a - array observations of the detected maser in 3c403 were performed in july 2003 with two ifs and a bandwith of 12.5 mhz each centered on one of the two maser features . using 32 spectral channel a velocity resolution of @xmath0 6kms@xmath1",
    "was reached . the beam width ( hpbm ) was @xmath0 0.1@xmath5 and the total on - source observation time was about @xmath0 8 hours .",
    "all data were reduced using standard procedures belonging either to the gildas or the aips software packages .",
    "_ lower panel _ spectral resolution of 1.25 mhz = 17.8kms@xmath1 .",
    "the arrow marks the nominal systemic velocity of the galaxy = 17688kms@xmath1 . ]",
    "the maser spectra of 3c403 , taken in january with the effelsberg telescope , are shown in fig.[2spec ] .",
    "the profile is composed of two main components ( asymmetrically ) bracketing the nominal systemic velocity of the galaxy ( c@xmath12 = 17688kms@xmath1 , see next section ) : the stronger one has a velocity of c@xmath12 = 17827@xmath131kms@xmath1 , a width of 31@xmath132kms@xmath1 , and a flux density peak of 23@xmath133mjy ; the weaker one has a velocity of c@xmath12 = 17644@xmath135kms@xmath1 , a width of 53@xmath138kms@xmath1 , and a peak flux density of 4.0@xmath130.5mjy . using a distance of 235mpc ( @xmath14 = 75kms@xmath1mpc@xmath1 )",
    ", the total isotropic luminosities are 950@xmath13140 and 280@xmath1355 for the main components , respectively .",
    "hence , the maser in 3c403 is the most distant and one of the most luminous water maser so far reported ( the most luminous maser , with 6000 , and , before this discovery also the most distant one , is in txfs2226 - 184 ; )    the outcome of the vla observations ( fig.[vla ] ; right - hand side ) confirms the presence of the two main maser features , and indicates that the maser emission is unresolved and arise from a location within 0.1@xmath5 ( @xmath6 110 pc ) from the active galactic nucleus .",
    "the strength of the weaker line is consistent with the single - dish result , while the stronger line is much weaker than that obtained with effelsberg . because of the unresolved nature of the emission it is unlikely that the loss of flux density in the feature is due to extended emission resolved - out because of the higher resolution . more probably , the cause is a flare - down of the component due to strong variability , a phenomenon already well known to exist in water masers .",
    "2.5@xmath5 ( fwhm ) . for details ,",
    "see black et al .",
    "_ right - hand side _ the two main water maser features in 3c403 observed with the vla a - array .",
    "both lines arise from a location within 0.1@xmath5 ( @xmath6 110 pc ) from the active galactic nucleus ( ra@xmath15 = 19@xmath16 52@xmath17 15.8@xmath18 ; dec@xmath15 = 02@xmath19 30@xmath20 24@xmath21 ) . ]",
    "the standard unified scheme of agn requires an obscuring region , possibly containing molecular gas that surrounds the central engine and that effectively shields the inner few parsecs from view , if the radio axis lies close to the plane of the sky @xcite . in the innermost part , at radii up to some tenths of a parsec ,",
    "this material is likely to form a rapidly rotating accretion disk around a central supermassive black hole . at larger distances ( up to about 50 - 100 pc ) the atomic and molecular gas is possibly distributed in a toroidal structure providing obscuration of the central regions to particular lines - of - sight .",
    "indeed , very few direct detections of molecular gas in radio - loud galaxies have been reported so far ( @xmath22 in cygnusa : ; co in 3c293 : ) .",
    "the detection discussed here strongly favors the presence of molecular material near the central engines of at least some friis .",
    "past negative results in molecular line surveys may also be a consequence of observational sensitivity limits ( such a possibility was also mentioned by ) .",
    "furthermore , because of the high gas densities required for h@xmath23o masers to operate ( @xmath210@xmath3@xmath4 ; e.  g.  ) , our detection represents the densest interstellar gas component ever observed in a radio - loud galaxy ( typical values for molecular gas densities range between @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath4 ; e.  g.  ) .      because of the large uncertainty of the systemic velocity 100kms@xmath1 . ]",
    "( @xmath26 ) of 3c403 , the following discussion and ( preliminary ) conclusions are based on the assumption that @xmath26 is placed ( as indicated in fig.[2spec ] ) between the two main h@xmath23o maser components .    as mentioned in sect.1 , interferometric studies of h@xmath11o megamasers have shown that the emission is either associated with a nuclear accretion disk ( for ngc4258 , see e.g.  ) or with the radio - jets interacting with dense molecular material near the center ( for mrk348 , see ) .      only vlbi interferometric observations at milliarcsecond resolution ( spatial scales of @xmath6 1 parsec )",
    "will allow us to determine ( or to provide an upper limit to ) the extent of the emission and to pinpoint the exact location of the h@xmath11o emitting region(s ) in order to see if the maser is associated with an accretion disk or radio jets . nevertheless , a qualitative discussion is possible on the basis of the single - dish spectra of fig .",
    "[ 2spec ] and the new vla observation .",
    "_ accretion disk _ : this scenario is particularly supported by the expected almost edge - on orientation of the nuclear obscuring layer ( see ) . as in the case of the seyfert galaxy ngc  4258 ( e.g.  ) , the spectrum should then show three distinct groups of features : one centered at the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( originating along the line of sight to the nucleus ) and two groups symmetrically offset from the systemic velocity , arising from those parts of the disk that are viewed tangentially .",
    "if the latter are the two lines we are observing , the rotational velocity of the disk is @xmath0100kms@xmath1 ( which is , we have to point out , very small when compared with that derived for ngc4258 ) . in 3c403",
    "the systemic lines seem instead to be missing .",
    "to explain this fact , partly following the hypothesis proposed by , we could argue that the circumnuclear disk is actually a _ thin rotating ring _ of the type modeled by @xcite ( 1994 ; their fig.2 ) , where masing gives a double - peaked profile only .",
    "_ jet interaction _ : the handful of bright knots visible in the radio images shown in fig.[vla ] ( left - hand side ) hints at the presence of jets interacting in several regions with the interstellar medium .",
    "the profile of the spectrum does not contradict a ` jet - origin ' of the detected maser emission in 3c403 .",
    "if we assume a symmetric molecular distribution , the two observed features could be interpreted as the red - shifted and blue - shifted counterparts of the maser line , arising from opposite jets close to the core .",
