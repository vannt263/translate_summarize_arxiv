    "the parkes data used in @xcite were archival but the new observations presented here were required because the archival data did not contain polarisation information .",

    "this error estimate relies on the assumption that there is only one dominant faraday depth component within the fwhm of the rmsf ; if there are multiple faraday depth components within our rmsf then we can not uniquely specify their locations to better than 310  rad  m@xmath25 .",
    "however , for large @xmath52 ratios the rmclean algorithm may in principle be able to resolve components within the rmsf .",
    "we do not find any evidence for such components or for any significant broadening of the rmsf within the lobes of centaurus  a. in some regions of the observed field we find more than one peak in our faraday depth spectrum . while the origin of these multiple faraday depth components along the line of sight is interesting , none of these regions lie within the lobes of centaurus  a and are not included in our current study .",
    "the measured rms from the parkes observations are shown in figure  [ fig_rm ] displaying a clear enhancement in the magnitude of the rm within the lobes of centaurus  a. note that even with no faraday rotating material in the vicinity of centaurus  a , we could observe such an enhancement in the magnitude of the observed rm in regions where the polarized emission from centaurus  a dominates over the galactic emission .",
    "this can occur because the polarized emission of centaurus  a probes the full faraday depth along the line of sight to us , while the diffuse galactic polarized emission originates somewhere within our galaxy and may only probe more local faraday rotating regions depending on the exact location(s ) of the polarized emission within our galaxy .",
    "however , due to potential changes in the line of sight magnetic field direction , a longer line of sight does not necessarily mean a larger observed faraday depth .",
    "the galactic emission may also be subject to strong internal faraday rotation effects resulting in a significantly lower rm than that measured from the polarized emission from centaurus  a.      the mean rm of the background sources outside the lobes is @xmath54  rad  m@xmath25 with a standard deviation of @xmath55  rad  m@xmath25 @xcite .",

    "as the galactic polarized emission becomes a significant fraction of the centaurus  a polarized emission towards the edges of the lobes , the systematic error in the measured rm will become large .",
    "since we are unable to resolve the two contributions with our current dataset , we have only included in our analysis the regions within the lobes where the polarized emission from centaurus  a is strong enough to make the effect from the galactic emission negligible ( i.e. , for centaurus  a polarized emission @xmath60300  mjy  beam@xmath14 , see appendix ) .",
    "it is possible that the residual rm signal could be explained by a degree - scale variation in the galactic faraday depth that happens to coincide with the orientation of the giant lobes and is not sampled by the background sources outside the lobes .",
    "we consider this unlikely but can not definitively rule out such a scenario .",
    "there is a clear asymmetry in the distribution of signs of the residual rm between the northern and southern lobes .",
    "however , we are cautious not to over - interpret the sign of the residual rm since the smooth , foreground rm surface subtraction will not have removed any small angular - scale variations in the rm of our galaxy .",
    "therefore , residual rm contamination from our galaxy may contribute to local enhancements in the residual rm magnitude as well as changes in the sign of the residual rm in patches throughout the lobes .",

    ", width=302 ]      the observed residual rm signal may be due to faraday rotation from thermal gas within the lobes , a thin boundary layer of swept up material surrounding the lobes or a large - scale fluctuation in the galactic foreground faraday depth coinciding with the position of the giant lobes .",
    "it is important to note that the subtraction using the fit to the background rms just outside the lobes not only removes the smooth faraday depth contribution of our galaxy but also of any smooth rm component on large angular scales caused by the intragroup medium or an extended halo of magnetized thermal plasma surrounding the lobes .",
    "the sign of the residual rm of the background sources within the lobes appears to correlate well with the rm from the diffuse emission ( figure  [ fig_rrm ] ) .",
    "to quantitatively investigate the relation , we plot the residual background source rms ( rm@xmath65 ) against the corresponding residual rms of the polarized emission from centaurus  a ( rm@xmath62 ) along the same sightline ( figure  [ fig_correlation ] ) .",
    "there are some obvious discrepancies , which are not unexpected given the different scales probed by the atca ( @xmath8@xmath66 ) and parkes ( @xmath8@xmath67 ) observations as well as the intrinsic scatter in the background source rms @xcite .",

    "this tentatively suggests that either a larger amount of gas is present within the southern lobe or the lobe orientation is such that the southern lobe is further away ; however , it is difficult to claim this difference as significant given the smaller number of data points in the northern lobe compared to the southern lobe .",
    "overall , the range @xmath75 supports an interpretation of internal faraday rotation in which there is an asymmetric distribution of emitting and rotating regions within the lobes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , possibly with a small amount of faraday rotation external to the lobes . however , we can not discount entirely external effects due to the orientation of the lobes or residual rm contamination from the galaxy ( as described in section 3.1 ) .",
    "we avoid any in - depth modelling based on the value of @xmath76 due to the sparse and unevenly sampled nature of the background sources .",
    "a much denser grid of background sources is required for more robust comparisons and detailed modelling of the distribution of emitting and rotating regions associated with the giant lobes .",
    "previous work by @xcite found a turbulent rm signal associated with the southern lobe due to either turbulent structure throughout the lobe or in a thin skin surrounding the lobe boundary .",
    "if we assume that the residual large - scale rm signal we detect is due to a thin boundary layer of depth @xmath77  kpc , then with an estimate of the line - of - sight magnetic field , @xmath39 , we can obtain the expected electron number density of the skin , @xmath78 .",
    "based on the value of the magnetic field strength in the lobes of @xmath79  @xmath40 g , as derived in @xcite based on broadband modelling of radio and @xmath80-ray data , we can place a strong upper limit for the line - of - sight magnetic field in the skin of @xmath81  @xmath40 g .",
    "this leads to a conservative lower limit of @xmath82  @xmath1 .",
    "this type of model is mainly based on the work of @xcite who used hydrodynamic simulations to show that kelvin - helmholtz instabilities may form on the surface of radio lobes and potentially cause advection of the lobe magnetic field into the surrounding medium .",

    "an intergalactic medium ( igm ) density of @xmath83  @xmath1 was suggested by @xcite to explain a discontinuity in the hi properties of centaurus a group dwarf galaxies through ram - pressure stripping arguments .",
    "however , this would seem excessively large for such a poor group of galaxies . in order to estimate a more plausible intragroup density at the extent ( @xmath84 ) of the giant lobes , we use a standard profile @xmath85 .",
    "this gives @xmath86  @xmath1 for the typically derived values of @xmath87  @xmath1 , @xmath88  kpc and @xmath89 @xcite , although the large scatter in the scaling parameters should be noted .",
    "the expansion of the lobes is expected to sweep up and possibly compress the intragroup medium around the edges of the lobes . even if we consider a maximum compression factor of four , from a strong shock ( which would be highly unlikely for the giant lobes ) , it is still not sufficient to reach @xmath90  @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , a rather low magnetisation of the igm is expected on scales of hundreds of kiloparsecs from the group centre , certainly much less than the equipartition value in the lobes , unless some additional processes are able to substantially amplify the igm magnetic field , as discussed in @xcite for example .",
    "many theoretical models for the structure of extended lobes actually assume zero magnetisation of the ambient medium into which the lobes evolve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the estimated value of @xmath90  @xmath1 should be considered as a very conservative lower limit , corresponding to the maximum magnetisation of the igm in the vicinity of the expanding lobes .",

    "we see that depolarisation from an external faraday screen can , in principle , explain the total depolarisation observed at these four positions of the giant lobes .",
    "however , we note that fluctuations in the complex polarisation can become dominant at long wavelengths resulting in a much weaker than expected decrease in the degree of polarisation due to external faraday dispersion @xcite . hence , for centaurus  a , the observed depolarisation may not be very well described by an exponential decrease in the degree of polarisation .    in figure  [ fig_p ]",
    "we can see a strong asymmetry between the polarized intensity in the inner parts of the northern and southern giant lobes , the origin of which could be attributed to the laing - garrington effect @xcite .",
    "this effect is commonly assigned to a halo of thermal gas , threaded by a turbulent magnetic field , surrounding the radio galaxy @xcite . in this case , the depolarisation is larger for the assumed more distant southern lobe , in which the path length through the surrounding gas is larger . however , there is no compelling evidence for the exact orientation of the lobes .",
    "the effect may also be explained by internal differences between the two lobes and/or from a gradient , with galactic latitude , in the properties of the foreground galactic faraday screen .    in order to comment further on this issue , we show the fractional polarisation within the giant lobes in figure  [ fig_fpol ] .",
    "one of the most interesting features of this image is the high degree of polarisation located @xmath80.5@xmath64 south - west of the bright core .",
    "we speculate that this region may be the oppositely - directed counterpart of the well studied northern middle lobe @xcite , which until now had no observed southern counterpart .",
    "this `` southern middle lobe '' may have lost its structure and merged with the outer / older radio lobe after uplifting and mixing with a large amount of gas from the host galaxy .",
    "this scenario would require some asymmetry in the distribution of gas within the host galaxy which is not unreasonable in the aftermath of a merger event @xcite .",
    "in fact , a recent study by @xcite found , for sources exhibiting the laing - garrington effect , that the jet brightness asymmetry on kpc - scales can not be explained by beaming and therefore must be intrinsic ( in cases where the estimated kpc - scale outflow speeds are close to @xmath104 ) .",
    "they conclude that a laing - garrington effect due to intrinsic differences in the faraday rotating material within radio galaxy lobes can not be discounted . based on these results and our arguments in section  3.2 for a significant fraction of thermal material mixed in with the relativistic plasma of the lobes ,",

    "hence , we consider the fitted parameters of this model , shown in table  2 , as reasonable estimates of the model parameters which can describe the observed depolarisation given our current observational knowledge .    due to the random component of the magnetic field in the lobes ,",
    "we expect to see an excess dispersion in the rm within the lobes over the rm dispersion outside the lobes ( i.e. , @xmath127 ) .",
    "however , this is difficult to disentangle from the turbulent magnetoionic medium of our galaxy that likely varies throughout the entire field as well as from effects more local to the source due to the orientation of the lobes ( e.g. the laing - garrington effect ) .",
    "the standard deviation of the rm from the diffuse galactic emission ( outside the lobes ) is @xmath8@xmath134  rad  m@xmath25 while the rm of the polarized emission from centaurus  a has a standard deviation of @xmath8@xmath135  rad  m@xmath25 .",
    "this difference can not be regarded as significant , given our individual measurement errors ( section  2.3 ) , but it is not inconsistent with the fitted values of @xmath136 used to describe the depolarisation in the lobes .    the total magnetic field strength ( @xmath137 ) in the northern and southern lobes has been estimated at @xmath138  @xmath40 g from the modelling of radio and @xmath80-ray data @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic degree of polarization of synchrotron radiation ( @xmath139 ) is reduced from its maximum level according to the relation @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 , with @xmath143 representing the spectral index @xcite .",
    "therefore , using the spectral index of particular regions of the giant lobes obtained from @xcite and the mean observed fractional polarization from our observations , we can estimate the strength of the ordered ( @xmath125 ) and random ( @xmath126 ) magnetic field components .",
    "for example , at the position ( @xmath100 , @xmath144 ) we have @xmath145 , therefore @xmath146",
    "@xmath40 g .",
    "considering a path length through the lobes of @xmath147  kpc and a magnetic field fluctuation scale of @xmath148  kpc , we use @xmath149 and @xmath150 to find , for the four selected regions of the lobes , @xmath151  @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite provided an upper limit on the volume - averaged thermal electron density of the lobes of @xmath152  @xmath1 , where in this case we use @xmath153  @xmath40 g instead of the equipartition value of 1.3  @xmath40 g used in their paper .",
    "this limit was based on sampling of the background sources inside the lobes , probing a distribution presumably more inhomogeneous than the sparse sampling of the background sources could detect .",
    "however , the limit is not inconsistent with our results .",
    "our measured value of @xmath154  @xmath1 based on our internal faraday rotation interpretation provides a very good description of all the current observables ( i.e. , the residual rm signal , the depolarisation and the excess rm dispersion associated with the lobes ) .",
    "although we can not definitively rule out external faraday effects as an explanation for the total amount of observed depolarisation , we prefer the internal faraday rotation interpretation since it better explains all the observational evidence . taking this as our preferred model we now investigate some of the important consequences for the giant lobes .      in order to calculate the pressure in the lobes due to the thermal gas ( @xmath155 ) , we require an estimate for the temperature ( @xmath156 ) of the gas .",
    "recent x - ray results from a small region of the southern lobe found an excess of diffuse , thermal emission from centaurus  a over the background , with a best - fit gas temperature of @xmath4  kev and a number density of @xmath0  @xmath1 @xcite , in excellent agreement with the density estimate made in section  3.3 above .",
    "interestingly , this leads to a thermal pressure , @xmath157  erg  @xmath1 which is approximately equal to the total non - thermal pressure , @xmath158  erg  @xmath1 @xcite , where the magnetic energy density @xmath159 .",
    "it is important to note that our derivations do not depend on an equipartition assumption , and therefore , on the unknown contribution of relativistic protons .",
    "they depend instead on the magnetic field value derived from the broadband modelling in @xcite , whose primary assumption is that the detected @xmath80-ray flux is solely due to the inverse - compton emission of the radio emitting electrons .",
    "the derived magnetic field value is thus consistent with the case of an approximate energy equipartition between the magnetic field , radiating electrons , and potentially any relativistic protons present ( i.e. @xmath160 ) .",
    "the majority of extended lobes in low - power radio galaxies are found to be under - pressured or in approximate pressure equilibrium with their external environment , under the assumption of energy equipartition between the magnetic field and radio - emitting electrons within the lobes @xcite .",
    "hence , those lobes must be either far from the magnetic field ",
    "relativistic electrons energy equipartition , or there must be additional pressure provided by particles contributing only weakly to the observed non - thermal continuum of the lobes to maintain the structure of the expanding cavity . here",
    "we have found direct evidence for thermal particles contributing substantially to the internal pressure in the giant lobes of centaurus  a. even so , approximate equipartition between the thermal and non - thermal gas pressures still can not entirely explain the pressure mis - match in all low - power radio galaxies , indicating that relativistic protons may have a substantial contribution in some cases .",
    "based on the derived number density of @xmath0  @xmath1 and the estimated volume @xmath161  @xmath162 @xcite , we find that the total mass of the thermal gas within the lobes is @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the mass of ionized hydrogen and we use a volume filling factor @xmath165 .",
    "similar amounts of gas inferred from metal - enriched outflows have also been observed in a number of other radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "we consider the possibility that the vast majority of the thermal material has either been entrained as the jet ploughed through the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy @xcite and/or pushed out by the over - pressured lobes as they expand outwards @xcite .",
    "entrainment of thermal material is considered as the most likely mechanism for decelerating relativistic jets @xcite but the amount of material required is of the order of @xmath166  m@xmath167/yr @xcite .",
    "therefore , this is highly unlikely to be able to provide the necessary 200  m@xmath167/yr required by our results , for a lobe age of the order of 100  myr @xcite .",
    "more likely is that the expanding lobes push out large amounts of gas from the host galaxy atmosphere / halo through successive episodes of jet activity . in centaurus",
    "a there is evidence for at least four episodes of activity : the giant outer lobes , the northern middle lobe @xcite , the inner lobes @xcite , and the parsec - scale jets @xcite .",
    "recent simulations @xcite have shown the importance of inhomogeneity of the ism which can cause deflection of the jet flow , allowing the radio source to effect a much larger volume of the host galaxy . in this way",
    ", a large amount of gas can be swept up by the influence of the jet at large distances from the center of the galaxy , possibly explaining the substantial amount of gas we have detected within the lobes .",
    "such a large removal of gas from the host galaxy provides a direct mechanism for suppressing star formation while also limiting the amount of gas that can cool and fall back towards the center of the galaxy , which may also limit the growth of the central supermassive black hole .",
    "it is also possible that a significant fraction of the mass of thermal gas within the lobes was entrained from the intergroup medium and dispersed over the entire lobe volume .",
    "more detailed simulations with synthetic faraday rotation observations will be required to help distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "we have presented results from a spectropolarimetric study , using the parkes radio telescope at 1.4  ghz , investigating the faraday rotation of the diffuse polarized emission from the giant lobes of the radio galaxy , centaurus a. using previous results from an rm grid of background radio sources just outside the lobes @xcite , the smooth foreground contribution to the observed rm from centaurus  a was subtracted , leaving a mean residual rm signal of @xmath168  rad  m@xmath25 .",
    "investigation of whether the residual rm signal comes from a thin - skin / boundary layer of magnetoionic material surrounding the lobes or from thermal gas internal to the lobes , found the thin - skin scenario highly unlikely given that it requires at least an order of magnitude enhancement of the swept up gas over the expected intragroup density on these scales .",
    "it should be noted that we can not conclusively rule out that the residual rm signal comes from a degree - scale fluctuation in the smooth galactic foreground that was not sampled by the ensemble of background sources outside the lobes and happens to align with the orientation of the giant lobes .    from our investigation of the degree of polarisation at three separate frequencies ( 2.3 , 1.4 & 0.96  ghz ) at four positions of high",
    "s / n , we find strong depolarisation which can not be explained solely by the effects of beam depolarisation .",
    "considering all the available data , we consider depolarisation due to faraday rotation within the lobes as our preferred scenario , even in the presence of external faraday dispersion from a foreground screen . in this case",
    ", we estimate the number density of the thermal gas @xmath154  @xmath1 which gives a total ionized gas mass within the lobes of @xmath2  m@xmath3 .",
    "recent x - ray observations of a small region of the southern lobe also find evidence for thermal gas within the lobe with a temperature of @xmath169  kev @xcite . from this",
    "we estimate that the thermal pressure within the lobes is approximately equal to the non - thermal pressure implying that the thermal gas , radio - emitting electrons and magnetic field are all in approximate equipartition with each other .",
    "future radio polarisation observations are required to have much wider @xmath47-coverage to provide the high resolution in faraday depth space needed to uniquely separate the internal and external faraday rotating components .",
    "indeed the planned global magneto - ionic medium survey ( gmims ) which covers 3001800  mhz @xcite provides an excellent opportunity to resolve the faraday rotation structure in the giant lobes of centaurus  a.",
