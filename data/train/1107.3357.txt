    "we have calculated the rate of transition between the two thermally equilibrium states of a buckled nanorod / nanotube at fixed strain using quantum mechanical version of transition state theory . although this mechanical system has analogies to the superconducting interference device in which the first observation of a coherent superposition of macroscopically distinct states was reported @xcite , but our method strictly address the thermally induced incoherent relaxation rate from one buckled state to the other at a fixed strain .",

    "in the regime where @xmath80 the rate is given by ( saddle is the bent rod ) @xcite @xmath81 now we follow the work of voth , chandler and miller @xcite for rate calculation using quantum mechanical transition state theory near the second buckling instability ( where @xmath82 is small ) .",
    "the qtst rate under the harmonic approximation diverges at @xmath44 , but using this method it is possible to avoid the divergence @xcite . for this",
    "we go beyond the harmonic approximations for the first two modes .",

    "but following the idea of blencowe @xcite , the system which is initially in thermal equilibrium near the bottom of the well , can be excited to an energy level below the barrier maximum , then it will be more likely to tunnel through the barrier than being thermally activated over it .",
