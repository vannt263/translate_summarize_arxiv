    "the question of existence of a unique ( variational ) solution to equations of the form is well - understood : first results were established in @xcite , for an overview in the above stated generality and further references we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "existence of a strong solution under various assumptions appeared in @xcite and numerical approximations were studied in @xcite . in the case of linear operator @xmath26 which generates a strongly continuous semigroup , more is known concerning regularity and maximal regularity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    naturally , the time regularity of a solution to is limited by the regularity of the driving wiener process @xmath9 . in particular ,",
    "since the trajectories of @xmath9 are only @xmath36-hlder continuous for @xmath37 , it can be seen from the integral formulation of that the trajectories of @xmath38 are @xmath36-hlder continuous as functions taking values in @xmath39 .",
    "this can be improved if some additional regularity in space of the solution is known , that is , the equation is satisfied in a stronger sense . in this note , we are particularly interested in situations where such additional space regularity is either not available or limited .",
    "this is typically the case when    * @xmath40 is linear but the noise is not smooth enough : if @xmath41 is a variational solution to then the standard assumption is @xmath42 .",
    "is the space of weak@xmath43-measurable mappings @xmath44 such that @xmath45 * @xmath40 is nonlinear as for instance the @xmath4-laplacian @xmath46 or a more general nonlinear operator with @xmath4-growth and , in addition , the noise represents the same difficulty as in ( i ) .    in order to formulate our main result",
    "we need several additional assumptions upon the operator @xmath26 and the initial datum @xmath47 . on the one hand ,",
    "we introduce a notion of @xmath48-monotonicity which represents a stronger version of the monotonicity assumption on @xmath26 , on the other hand , we suppose certain regularity in time of @xmath26 as well as regularity of the initial condition .",
    "to be more precise , we assume    * [ eq : gmon ] @xmath48-monotonicity : there exists a bounded ( possibly nonlinear ) mapping @xmath49 and @xmath50 such that for all @xmath51 , @xmath16 $ ] @xmath52 * time regularity of @xmath26 : there exists @xmath53 such that for all @xmath54 , @xmath55 $ ] @xmath56 * regularity of @xmath47 : @xmath57 a.s . for all @xmath16 $ ] and there exists @xmath58 such that @xmath59    note that it can be readily checked that the operators @xmath26 in the above mentioned examples ( i ) and ( ii ) are @xmath48-monotone . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath40 is linear and symmetric negative definite we can choose @xmath60 and , as was shown in @xcite , the @xmath4-laplacian is covered via @xmath61 which is the natural quantity to establish its regularity properties .",
    "finally we have all in hand to state our result .",
    "[ eq : time ] assume that _",
    "( h1)-(h8 ) _",
    "hold true .",
    "if @xmath38 is a solution to , in particular @xmath62 then @xmath63    if one drops the assumption ( h8 ) then holds locally in time away from 0 .",
    "[ rem : new ] the statement of theorem [ eq : time ] continues to hold if we replace _",
    "( h6 ) _ with the following assumption :    * [ eq : gmon ]",
    "modified @xmath48-monotonicity : there exists a separable hilbert space @xmath64 ( generally different from @xmath65 ) and a bounded mapping @xmath66 and @xmath67 such that for all @xmath51 , @xmath16 $ ] @xmath68    in this case we have to replace @xmath65 by @xmath64 in and .",
    "let us now explain what are the main motivations for such a result .",
    "first , it turns out that is the natural time regularity that allows to establish the optimal rates of convergence for numerical schemes based on time discretization ( or a space - time discretization provided a suitable space regularity can be proved as well ) .",
    "indeed , with this time regularity at hand , a finite element based space - time discretization of stochastic @xmath4-laplace type systems will be studied in @xcite .",
    "a similar strategy can be directly applied to establish rates of convergence for time discretization of more general monotone spdes satisfying ( among others ) the key @xmath48-monotonicity assumption .",
    "second , if @xmath26 is a linear infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup @xmath69 on @xmath65 then the ( mild ) solution to with @xmath70 is given by the stochastic convolution @xmath71 and our result gives @xmath72 .",
    "recall that the space @xmath73 here is the borderline case regarding regularity for the stochastic convolution , namely , @xmath74 may not even have a pathwise continuous version whereas for @xmath75 has @xmath36-hlder continuous trajectories for @xmath76 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.16 , subsection 5.4.2 ) ) .",
    "consequently , the borderline case is typically not covered by known methods such as factorization @xcite or stochastic maximal regularity ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 , theorem 1.2 ) ) and theorem [ eq : time ] provides an additional information based on a rather simple argument .    a complete proof will be given in @xcite .",
    "it is based on a new version of the it formula which applies to time differences and yields the following : let @xmath77 and @xmath78 $ ] then it holds true a.s .",
    "@xmath79 here @xmath80 denotes the backward it stochastic differential and @xmath81 the quadratic variation process .",
    "the appearance of the backward it stochastic integral comes from the fact that the it formula is applied to the time difference @xmath82 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath83 denotes the martingale part of @xmath41 , then for every fixed @xmath84 the process @xmath85 is a ( forward ) local martingale with respect to the forward filtration given by @xmath86 , @xmath87 whereas for every fixed @xmath88 $ ] the process @xmath89 is a ( backward ) local martingale with respect to the backward filtration given by @xmath90 , @xmath91.$ ]    as the next step , we substitute for @xmath92 and @xmath93 in , take expectation and apply hypotheses ( h5)-(h8 ) . finally we obtain that @xmath94 which implies the required regularity .",
    "in this section we present some concrete examples of problems which are covered by our result .",
    "let us assume that @xmath95 is linear dissipative and symmetric infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup on @xmath65 .",
    "then the square root @xmath96 is well - defined and setting @xmath97 ( equipped with the graph norm ) we obtain , for all @xmath51 , that @xmath98 thus the hypothesis ( h6 ) holds true with @xmath99 and theorem [ eq : time ] applies .",
    "let @xmath100 be a bounded lipschitz domain and let @xmath101 . we suppose that @xmath102 satisfies ( h1 ) and ( h5 ) .",
    "we are interested in the system @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a general nonlinear operator with @xmath4-growth , i.e. @xmath105 for all @xmath106 with some constants @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "then the assumptions ( h1)-(h4 ) are satisfied with @xmath110 and , in addition , it is well known from the deterministic setting ( and was already discussed in @xcite in the stochastic setting ) that an important role for this system is played by the function @xmath111 it is used in regularity theory @xcite and also for the numerical approximation @xcite .",
    "the essential property of @xmath112 can be characterized by the inequality @xmath113 for some positive constants @xmath114 depending only on @xmath4 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , for all @xmath115 , @xmath116 and therefore ( h6 ) is satisfied and theorem [ eq : time ] yields @xmath117 note that in case of the heat equation ( i.e. @xmath118 ) the operator @xmath119 is the identity .      in continuum mechanics ,",
    "the motion of a homogeneous incompressible fluid is described by its velocity field @xmath120 and its pressure function @xmath121 .",
    "if the flow is slow motion can be described via the system @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 satisfy the hypotheses of subsection [ subsec : plapla ] and @xmath125 is the symmetric gradient of the velocity field @xmath126 . in comparison to the navier",

    "similarly to the @xmath4-laplace system we set @xmath131 and obtain , for all @xmath132 , @xmath133 where @xmath134 .",
