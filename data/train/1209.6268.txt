    "<S> we propose an effective field theory for the low - energy @xmath1 interactions to describe these final - state interactions and find that the anomalous lineshape of the @xmath1 cross section observed by the besii collaboration can be well described .    as the first charmonium state above the @xmath1 threshold , </S>",
    "<S> the resonance @xmath2 is different from other charmonia with lower masses . </S>",
    "<S> because the @xmath2 decay into the open charm @xmath4 is allowed by the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule , this dominant decay mode leads to a broad width up to @xmath5 mev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the direct production process of @xmath6 is useful for the study of the properties of @xmath2 . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , besii collaboration reported an anomalous behavior of the cross - section lineshape at the @xmath2 mass region in @xmath0 that can not be described by a simple breit - winger of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> such an observation has inspired interesting theoretical discussions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it was found that the interfering effect between @xmath2 and @xmath3 plays a very important role in understanding the anomalous lineshape of @xmath1 at the @xmath2 resonance  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an interference can be recognized by a relative phase factor @xmath7 , which is introduced between these two resonances , and the phase angle @xmath8 must be large to describe the anomalous @xmath1 lineshape .    in principle , the phase factor @xmath7 can come from the final - state interactions of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it should be interesting to study the @xmath1 anomalous lineshape using an effective field theory to describe the @xmath1 final - state interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this forms our motivation for this work . near </S>",
    "<S> the threshold , the @xmath1 pair produced in @xmath9 comes from the decay of the @xmath2 and other nonresonance background processes . </S>",
    "<S> once the @xmath1 pair is produced , it could undergo final - state interactions before it converts into the final observed @xmath1 state . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon could explain the relative phase between the @xmath2 and other non-@xmath2 amplitude and provide a description of the @xmath1 lineshape . </S>",
    "<S> we note that there are several cases in which the final - state interactions play important roles in the understanding of the cross - section lineshapes  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that an effective field theory is a useful tool to study the low - energy hadron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> an effective field theory utilizes the tailor expansion of the small ratio between the typical small scale @xmath10 and the cutoff scale @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , @xmath10 is the momentum of the low - energy pion or pion mass , whereas @xmath12 sets the cutoff scale of this effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> an effective field theory for the low - energy @xmath1 is different from that for the low - energy @xmath13 interaction because the @xmath2 should be included explicitly into the effective lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the three - vector momentum of the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) meson , another small scale , @xmath16 mev , also appears in the effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> this additional small scale will make the power counting different from that in chpt . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic development of the effective field theory with resonances as intermediate states is still under exploration , and interesting discussions on this subject can be found in refs </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we use the effective field theory to study the @xmath17 interaction to understand the dynamic details of the anomalous cross - section lineshape observed by the besii collaboration  @xcite .    at the beginning </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the production of @xmath1 in @xmath18 annihilation can be approximated by the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption means that the cross section for @xmath19 is dominated by intermediate vector meson productions via @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes any vector meson with an isospin of @xmath22 or @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is impossible to sum the contributions from all of the @xmath21 in reality . as a reasonable approximation </S>",
    "<S> , one can include the contributions from the vector mesons in the vicinity of the considered energy region but neglect those far off - shell vector mesons . in the energy region of the bes data from 3.74 gev to 3.8 gev , one can expect that @xmath2 plays the most important role among all of the @xmath21 , whereas the contributions from all the other @xmath21 can be treated as background . as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the contribution from @xmath3 dominates the background , whereas the contributions from other states are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we only include the contributions from the resonances @xmath2 and @xmath3 and neglect those from the other resonances . </S>",
    "<S> namely , @xmath3 would be the main background near the @xmath4 threshold .    in vmd  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the coupling between the vector meson and a virtual photon can be described as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the vector meson field , @xmath26 is the photon field , and @xmath27 is the mass of the vector meson . setting the electron mass to @xmath28 , the coupling can be obtained as @xmath29^{1/2},\\label{efv}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the electron - position decay width of @xmath25 and @xmath31 is the fine - structure constant .    </S>",
    "<S> once the @xmath1 pair is produced from the decay of the vector meson @xmath2 or @xmath3 , the pair can undergo final - state interactions through the rescattering processes @xmath32 , which can be described by the effective field theory . in the energy region of interest , </S>",
    "<S> the three - vector momentum @xmath10 of the @xmath33 meson is small . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is possible to construct an effective field theory for the low - energy @xmath1 interactions by making use of the expansion of the small momentum @xmath10 . because the mass of @xmath2 is just above the threshold of @xmath1 , we need to include @xmath2 explicitly in the formulation . near the threshold , the @xmath14(@xmath15 ) </S>",
    "<S> meson can be treated as nonrelativistic . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the interaction lagrangian for the @xmath1 system with the quantum number @xmath34 can be constructed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the field operator of @xmath2 ; @xmath14 ( @xmath37 ) annihilates a @xmath14(@xmath15 ) meson ; @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) creates a @xmath14(@xmath15 ) meson ; @xmath40 is the pauli matrix , and the ellipsis denotes other contact terms with more derivatives that are higher order terms . the first term in @xmath41 accounts for the interaction in the isospin singlet channel , and the second term accounts for the isospin triplet channel . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from other resonances , which are not included in the lagrangian , can be saturated into the contact terms @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we take the coefficients such as @xmath43 to be complex , where the imaginary parts of these terms come from the width of the saturated resonances and the @xmath17 annihilation effect . with isospin symmetry , we only have to consider the terms for the isospin singlet channel in @xmath42 to study the @xmath1 final - state interactions because the @xmath1 pair comes from the decay of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in our approach .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) @xmath44 , ( b ) contact interaction.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    now we come to the discussion of the power counting of this effective field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the tree - level diagrams for the @xmath1 elastic scattering are shown in fig .  [ tree ] . </S>",
    "<S> near the @xmath1 threshold , the denominator of the @xmath2 propagator can be expressed as @xmath45 where @xmath10 is the magnitude of the three - vector momentum of the @xmath14(@xmath15 ) meson in the overall center - of - mass frame , @xmath46 denotes the non-@xmath1 decay width of @xmath2 , and @xmath47 is the mass of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 decay width of @xmath2 will be included through the summation of the d meson loops in the following . because @xmath2 is close to the threshold of @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that @xmath48 is at @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> taking the momentum power of the @xmath50 vertex into account , we find that fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tree](a ) is at @xmath51 . from the naive power counting , </S>",
    "<S> the leading contact terms have two derivatives ; hence , these terms are at @xmath52 . however , in this naive power counting , we have assumed that the coefficients of the contact terms , i.e. , @xmath53 , are at order of @xmath51 . in some cases , especially when </S>",
    "<S> there are bound states or resonances near the threshold , the coefficients of the contact terms can be enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a @xmath54 interaction , the s - wave contact terms @xmath55 scale as @xmath56@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another example is the @xmath54 interaction in @xmath57 , where the leading contact term @xmath58 can be promoted to @xmath49@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to study whether the same enhancement mechanism takes place in the @xmath1 interactions because the resonance @xmath2 is located near the @xmath4 threshold . if @xmath59 is promoted to @xmath49 as @xmath58 in a @xmath54 interaction , then the corresponding tree diagram shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tree](b ) is at @xmath51 , which is the same as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tree](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , because we do not know the power of @xmath59 at the beginning , we then assume that the leading contributions to @xmath1 elastic scattering come from both fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tree](a ) and ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will use the experiment data to determine @xmath59 and see whether this contact term is enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the @xmath1 scattering amplitude in the specific channel ( @xmath60 ) can be obtained by summing the bubble diagrams as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bubble ] , which is equivalent to solving the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath61 with the @xmath1 potential truncated at the leading order .     </S>",

    "<S> @xcite to describe the large - scattering - length system in our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the loop integrals that we will encounter in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it is clear that this result is convergent in @xmath65 but divergent in @xmath66 . with the pds scheme </S>",

    "<S> we can choose @xmath71 to be the typical momentum scale of the @xmath33 meson , which is @xmath72 mev in our calculations .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ xsect - isr ] ) , we first discuss our treatment of @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> it seems impossible to determine @xmath100 definitely in our fitting because @xmath100 is always accompanied by @xmath59 in our formula , and any change of @xmath100 can be compensated by tuning @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results on the non-@xmath1 branching ratio of @xmath2 decay are still controversial  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) pqcd calculation expects the non-@xmath4 decay branching ratio to be at most approximately @xmath101  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , an effective lagrangian approach estimates that the @xmath14 meson loop rescatterings into non-@xmath4 light vector and pseudoscalar mesons leads to approximately 1% non-@xmath4 branching ratios  @xcite . a similar calculation by ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite also confirms such a nonperturbative phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> one also notices that so far , most of the well - measured non-@xmath1 decay modes of @xmath2 are found to be rather small . </S>",

    "<S> the dashed and dotted lines are for the neutral and charged @xmath14-meson - pair born cross sections , respectively . combining the results shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fitdiagram ] and  [ born ] , we find that the anomalous cross - section lineshape could originate from the interferences from the @xmath3 pole and @xmath4 final - state interactions . because the @xmath3 pole is relatively isolated due to its relatively narrow width in comparison with the mass gap between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the relative phase between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 amplitudes is likely to be produced by the @xmath4 final - state interactions . </S>",
    "<S> although our calculation can not determine the absolute value for the possible non-@xmath4 decay branching ratio of @xmath2 , it is constructive to recognize the important role played by the final - state @xmath4 interactions that cause the deviation of the @xmath104 cross section in the @xmath2 mass region from a breit - wigner shape . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is useful for our further understanding of the @xmath2 non-@xmath4 decays as a manifestation of possible nonperturbative qcd mechanisms .    to test the effect of the @xmath59 term </S>",

    "<S> unsurprisingly , this figure shows that the contribution from @xmath3 is larger than that in the previous fitting in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fitdiagram ] because of the larger coupling constant @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> the distorted lineshape can be explained by the interference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which is constructive at @xmath108 but destructive at @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation can help us conclude that a large @xmath110 will favor a larger value for @xmath47 , i.e. , a larger mass for @xmath2 than the present pdg average . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that , in this fitting , the fitted @xmath111 is sensitive to @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the best fit gives @xmath112 when we fix @xmath113 . by adopting the pdg values  @xcite for @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> , the yield of @xmath111 can be even larger . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , such a large @xmath106 suggests that we need to include the contact term @xmath59 in the @xmath1 interaction to saturate the contribution from @xmath3 . with this aspect taken into account </S>",
    "<S> , we can affirm that the fitting result with @xmath82 is not self - consistent . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the inclusion of the @xmath59 term seems to be necessary to yield a reasonable value for @xmath110 and , at the same time , determine @xmath114 in a range closer to the pdg average  @xcite .     </S>",
