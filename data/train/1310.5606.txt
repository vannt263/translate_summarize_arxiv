    "we study here _ extremal hypersurfaces _ embedded in the @xmath1-dimensional minkowski space @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , we consider for a three - dimensional smooth manifold @xmath3 the embeddings @xmath4 such that @xmath5 has vanishing mean curvature , and such that the pull - back metric has lorentzian signature .",
    "we will consider the associated _",
    "cauchy problem_. given a two - dimensional smooth manifold @xmath6 and two maps @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we can ask for the existence and uniqueness of an interval @xmath9 and a map @xmath10 such that @xmath11 has vanishing mean curvature , @xmath12 , and the initial conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 are satisfied . observe that with the knowledge of @xmath15 it is possible to compute the pullback metric of @xmath16 along @xmath17 . as it turns out ,",
    "as long as the pullback metric is lorentzian , the _ quasilinear _ system of equations for the extremal hypersurface is second order regularly hyperbolic @xcite , and local well - posedness for smooth initial data holds ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is then natural to consider the large time behavior of the flow .",
    "note that not all solutions are global as there are known finite time blow up dynamics .",
    "let us for example exhibit a large but compactly supported perturbation of the catenoid ( see following paragraphs ; also section [ sect : formulation ] ) initial data which becomes singular in finite time .",
    "if we start with the initial data given by the standard infinite cylinder , that is @xmath18 we see that the equations of motion reduce to an ordinary differential equation in time for the radius @xmath19 of the cylinder @xmath20 which leads to the explicit solution @xmath21 this solution is singular at time @xmath22 , as @xmath23 is no longer injective : the cylinder has collapsed to the @xmath24 axis .",
    "( similar collapse results under symmetry assumptions has been studied by aurilia - christodoulou @xcite and can also be derived more generally from the result of nguyen - tian @xcite . )",
    "it is clear that such blow - ups do not depend on the asymptotics , as @xmath25 , of the initial data , due to the finite speed of propagation property of quasilinear wave equations .",
    "we can spatially localize the blow - up by taking initial data which smoothly glues a compact portion of the cylinder of length ( measured in the @xmath26 direction ) at least 2 to the catenoid ( with a corresponding compact region excised ) , analogously to the construction of compactly supported blow - up solutions to the focusing semilinear wave equation @xmath27 from the ode blow - up mechanism .    on the other hand ,",
    "a particular class of initial data which admits _ global _ solutions are those for which @xmath28 is the embedding for a _ minimal surface _ , and @xmath29 .",
    "it is easily checked that the map @xmath30 embeds @xmath31 into @xmath2 with zero mean curvature , and @xmath32 implies that the pullback metric is lorentzian .",
    "we consider in this paper the problem of _ stability _ of these stationary solutions",
    ". the first explicit consideration of a problem of this sort is due to brendle ( in higher dimensions ) @xcite and lindblad @xcite , building upon earlier works @xcite on global existence of general quasilinear wave equations .",
    "they consider small perturbations of the stationary solution given by a flat hyperplane .",
    "one can then write the solution as a graph over the stationary background , and reduce the problem to the small data problem for a _",
    "scalar _ quasilinear wave equation satisfying both the quadratic @xcite and cubic @xcite null conditions .",
    "in this paper we will consider the problem of stability for a non trivial stationary background .",
    "our work is in the spirit of recent studies of asymptotic stability of solitary waves for _ semilinear _ wave equations ( see for example @xcite ; see also @xcite for finite time blow up regimes which correspond to asymptotic stability in suitable rescaled variables ) , but in a _",
    "quasilinear _ setting .",
    "the background solution we choose is the _ catenoid _ , which is an embedded minimal surface in @xmath33 , and is a surface of revolution with topology @xmath34 .",
    "the induced riemannian metric on @xmath6 at a fixed time for this stationary solution is asymptotically flat ( with two ends ) .",
    "this fact is important in our analysis . indeed , as it is clear from the study by brendle and lindblad , to prove any sort of global existence statement we need to exploit the _",
    "pointwise radiative decay _ of solutions to the _ linearized equation _ on our background manifold . in @xcite",
    "the linearized equation is exactly the linear wave equation on @xmath35 , and the pointwise decay utilized is the classical one . in our case ,",
    "the linearized equation is a geometric wave equation on the curved background @xmath6 _ with a potential term_. the asymptotic flatness of @xmath6 thus plays an important role in establishing a decay mechanism .",
    "as mentioned above , a significant difference with the small data cases considered by lindblad and brendle is that the linearized equation is no longer the linear wave equation on the background manifold @xmath31 ; it also contains a potential term .",
    "in addition to introducing complications when applying the vector - field method to obtain decay , the potential term turns out to have the `` wrong sign '' .",
    "that is to say , the linearized equation admits an exponentially growing mode .",
    "as observed by krieger - lindblad @xcite , if one isolates the perturbation away from the `` collar region '' ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , one can verify that the solution exists `` up to the time when the collar begins to move '' ( due to finite speed of propagation ) .",
    "one should interpret this restriction as when the exponentially growing mode ( which is very small initially ) _ overtakes _ the radiating parts of the perturbation in size . in view of this exponentially growing mode",
    ", we can not obtain stability for arbitrary perturbations .",
    "similar to the analysis of krieger - schlag @xcite for the semilinear wave equation , we will prove ( for a more precise statement , see section [ sec : statement ] )    let @xmath36 be the unstable mode for the linear evolution .",
    "for any sufficiently small initial perturbation @xmath37 of catenoid initial data , we can find a small number @xmath38 such that solution generated by the initial data @xmath39 exists for all future time and decays asymptotically to the catenoid .",
    "while here we explicitly consider the case of embedding a hypersurface in @xmath2 , the method should easily carry over to the case where the ambient minkowski space has higher dimensions , as pointwise decay estimates ( section [ sect : linear ] ) improve in higher dimensions , making the nonlinear analysis ( section [ subsec : nonlin ] ) simpler .",
    "furthermore the spectral properties of the linearized operators ( section [ subsec : lin ] ) are qualitatively the same independently of the dimension .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : mainres ] we introduce the equation which we will study , discuss some of its main features , describe the linear theory , and state our main theorem . in section [ sec : boot ]",
    "we describe the bootstrap argument which will be used to prove our main theorem . in sections",
    "[ sec : energybounds ] through [ sec : dispersive ] , we improve on our bootstrap assumptions under the assumption that the projection of our solution on the unstable mode is under control . in section [ sec : existencea ] we improve our control of the unstable mode .",
    "finally , we prove our main theorem in section [ sec : proofmaintheorem ] .     as well as the `` radial '' coordinate @xmath26 . ]",
    "as mentioned above , we consider perturbations of the stationary catenoid solution to the extremal surface equation .",
    "the catenoid as a surface of revolution can be parametrized by ( see also figure [ fig1 ] ) @xmath40 where we use the standard cylindrical coordinates system on @xmath33 . throughout",
    "we use the notation @xmath41 .",
    "the parametrization here exposes the catenoid , a surface of revolution , as a warped product manifold with base @xmath42 and fibre @xmath43 ; the coordinate @xmath26 is chosen to be orthogonal to the fibers and to have unit length ( note that the parametrization is `` by arc length '' if we `` mod '' out the rotational degree of freedom ) . in this coordinate system",
    "we see that the induced riemannian metric on the catenoid has the line element @xmath44 and that @xmath45 as @xmath25 captures the asymptotic flatness of this manifold .",
    "in addition to the rotational symmetry , the catenoid also has a reflection symmetry about the plane @xmath46 ; in terms of the intrinsic coordinates , this is the mapping @xmath47 . _ for simplicity",
    ", we will consider only perturbations that preserve both symmetries .",
    "_ more precisely , we will consider the case where the perturbed solution is still , at any instance of time , a surface of revolution that is symmetric about the plane @xmath46 .",
    "note that since the induced riemannian metric on @xmath6 is asymptotically flat with two ends , the hamiltonian flow on @xmath48 using the pullback metric exhibits trapping , which is manifest in the closed geodesic at the `` collar '' of @xmath6 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the rotational symmetry reduces our scenario to the `` zero angular momentum case '' , and hence issues associated with the trapping of the geodesic flow do not appear in our analysis .",
    "a treatment of the full problem , without rotational symmetry , will require a modification of some parts of our proof which rely explicitly on the 1 + 1 reduction of the problem in rotational symmetry , as well as a detailed study of the trapping phenomenon , which usually induces a loss of derivatives .",
    "on the other hand , the reflection symmetry is only used to simplify the analysis by effectively fixing the centre of mass ; we do not expect there to be obstructions in removing this assumption given finite speed of propagation for nonlinear wave equations .",
    ".,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    given the geometric nature of our problem , there are many different ways of _ parametrizing _ our solution manifold @xmath3 ( or equivalently , fixing the time parameter @xmath49 , parametrizing the time slices ) .",
    "to cast the problem as a concrete system of partial differential equations requires choosing a _ gauge _ ( in other words , fixing a preferred parametrization ; this problem is typical for geometric equations such as the ricci flow or einstein equations ) . given the assumed symmetries one may be tempted into a _ geometric _",
    "gauge choice via intrinsic quantities : for example , the rotational symmetry means that naturally @xmath50 is a good candidate coordinate , and we may want to choose the other coordinate @xmath26 of @xmath6 to be orthogonal to @xmath50 and of unit length , similar to our parametrization of the catenoid .",
    "this choice turns out to be not suitable for studying the stability problem as the equation for the _ difference _ between our perturbed solution and the stationary catenoid becomes a complicated equation for a vector - valued function with a compatibility constraint ( coming from the `` unit - length '' requirement ) . by using the compatibility constraint",
    "one can convert this to a scalar _ non - local _ integro - differential equation .",
    "since we are interested in the stability problem in the rotationally symmetric case , instead we will consider our perturbed solution as a _ graph _ over the catenoid .",
    "more precisely , using that the outward - pointing unit normal vector field to the catenoid is @xmath51 , there is a natural smooth _ surjection _ from the normal bundle of the catenoid to @xmath33 , given by ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) @xmath52 by considering the radius of curvature for the constant @xmath50 level curves , we see that restricted to @xmath53 this mapping is regular and injective .",
    "since we are interested in perturbations of the @xmath54 level set , we make the assumption that our perturbed solution can be written as a graph over @xmath55 in this coordinate system .",
    "that is to say , we will study the _ small data problem _ for @xmath56 .",
    "note that our assumption of reflection symmetry implies that @xmath57 will be an even function in @xmath26 , and the lack of @xmath50 dependence indicates that the graph is a surface of revolution .    under this parametrization",
    ", we can derive the equation of motion for the extremal surface by formally writing down the euler - lagrange equations for the lagrangian given by the induced volume form on the graph associated to @xmath58 ; this computation is carried out in appendix [ app : reduction ] .",
    "we find that the equation of motion can be written as a quasilinear wave equation _ with potential _ for @xmath57 in the coordinates @xmath59 : @xmath60 where the quasilinear terms @xmath61 and semilinear terms @xmath62 are split into those quadratic , cubic , and quartic - or - more in @xmath57 and its derivatives :    [ eqs : mainquasi ] @xmath63,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    [ eqs : mainsemi ] @xmath64    we denote by @xmath65 this nonlinearity @xmath66      let us point out some of the main features of the equations , , and .",
    "that our argument can control the nonlinear terms using pointwise decay estimates is largely due to two special structures : the terms are either _ localized _ or they exhibit a _",
    "null condition_. we comment on these structures in section [ subsec : nonlin ] .",
    "the linear evolution introduces additional difficulties as there is an exponentially growing mode : the pointwise decay estimates we need can only be expected away from the growing mode .",
    "this is discussed in section [ subsec : lin ] .",
    "the reason that we separated the quadratic , cubic , and quartic - and - higher nonlinearities is that we intend to make use of the _ radiative decay _ effects of the wave equation on a ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional , asymptotically flat space - time to gain decay in the `` wave zone '' , the region where @xmath26 and @xmath49 are comparable .",
    "the experience with small - data , quasilinear wave equations on @xmath35 , see @xcite , indicates that the most dangerous terms are those which are quadratic and cubic in the nonlinearities , due to the expected linear decay rate of @xmath67 for wave equations in 2 spatial dimensions ( see also section [ sect : linear ] ) .    on the other hand , in and , almost all the nonlinear terms , in particular all the _ quadratic ones _ ,",
    "gain an additional boost in decay from the coefficients of the form @xmath68  in the wave zone this term contributes a decay rate of @xmath69 which vastly improves the situation . the term @xmath70 , for example , has the form @xmath71 with a coefficient which is much better than the integrability threshold of @xmath72 , if we assume an expected linear decay rate .",
    "as we shall see in the analysis , this _ localization _ of some of the most dangerous nonlinearities plays a crucial role in allowing us to close our decay estimates .    the only exception to",
    "this boost in decay occurs in the term @xmath73 : there we have a non - linearity of the form @xmath74 which is unweighted .",
    "however , as was observed in @xcite for the perturbation of the trivial solution , this term carries a _",
    "null structure_. one can see this purely at an algebraic level : in terms of the _ background null coordinates _",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 , the nonlinearity takes the form @xmath77 and hence verifies the _ cubic , quasilinear null condition _ @xcite .",
    "the null condition exhibits in particular a hidden divergence / gradient structure : in the context of elliptic theory it appears in the proof of wente s inequality @xcite ; and in the context of wave equations it drives the null form estimates of klainerman and machedon @xcite . for our explicit nonlinearity above",
    ", one can check easily that the following identity holds @xmath78 - 2\\partial_y\\big[\\partial_y\\phi(\\partial_t\\phi)^2\\big ] + \\partial_t\\big[(\\partial_y\\phi)^2\\partial_t\\phi\\big ] + 3(\\partial_t\\phi)^2(\\partial^2_{yy}\\phi - \\partial^2_{tt}\\phi).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the first three terms of the right - hand side exhibit the hidden divergence structure , while for the last term , we may replace @xmath79 using our original equation and hence obtain terms which are cubic _ with sufficient weights _ together with quartic and higher terms which have better decay properties .",
    "having described the difficulties that arise from the `` right hand side '' of , we turn our attention to the `` left hand side '' . the linear operator @xmath80 is in fact the coordinate - invariant wave operator @xmath81 on the background @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , the induced lorentzian metric on the stationary catenoid solution , as an embedded hypersurface of @xmath2 , is @xmath82 and its corresponding laplace - beltrami operator can be computed to be exactly . however , since we are considering the perturbation of a non trivial solution , there is also a lower order correction term generated by the linearization , namely the potential term @xmath83 on the left hand side of .",
    "note that the coefficient @xmath84 has a positive sign , which indicates that it is an _ attractive _ potential , and opens up the possibility of the existence of a negative energy ground state .",
    "this is related to the variational instability of the catenoid as a minimal surface @xcite : indeed , geometrically we can write the linear operator on the left hand side of as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the laplace - beltrami operator for the induced lorentzian metric on the static catenoid solution , and @xmath87 is the induced scalar curvature .",
    "this operator is formally the second variation of the extremal surface lagrangian , and in the riemannian case is precisely the _ stability operator _ for minimal hypersurfaces embedded in euclidean spaces .",
    "the positivity of the potential term and the linear instability is then seen as a consequence of minimal surfaces in @xmath33 necessarily having _ negative _ gaussian curvature .",
    "any corresponding eigenfunction of the linearized operator will generate either non - decaying or exponentially growing modes ; clearly this will complicate our estimates based on expectation of linear pointwise decay .",
    "now , the natural space on which to study our linear operator is the @xmath88 space adapted to the geometry ; that is to say , we should be looking at @xmath89 where @xmath6 is the catenoid . in the intrinsic",
    "coordinates @xmath90 this is @xmath91 .",
    "since we are working with rotationally symmetric functions , we find it convenient to absorb the weight @xmath92 onto the function @xmath57 instead , and work with @xmath93 .",
    "in other words we introduce the notation @xmath94 and we obtain in place of the following equation : @xmath95 thus , we are now working with the standard @xmath93 space and on this space the relevant linear operator @xmath96 is a short - range perturbation of the laplacian . since the potential term is a bounded multiplier which decays to @xmath97 as @xmath98 , the operator @xmath99 is self - adjoint on @xmath93 with domain @xmath100 , and its essential spectrum is exactly @xmath101 ( this result is classical , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * sections 13.1 and 14.3 ) ) . due to the @xmath102 decay of the potential term , the solutions to the ordinary differential equation @xmath103 for @xmath104",
    "are given by the jost solutions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem xi.57 ) , and hence there are no @xmath88 eigenfunctions with positive eigenvalue .    in the case",
    "@xmath105 , the equation @xmath106 can be solved explicitly : this is simply due to the fact that @xmath99 is the natural _ linearized _ operator for the minimal surface embedding problem , and that after fixing rotational symmetry , the catenoid solutions form a two parameter family due to the freedoms for scaling and translating ( along the axis ) . to be more precise , the standard catenoid we choose in is the element of the family @xmath107 parametrized by @xmath108 , with @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the two linearly independent solutions to @xmath111 correspond to infinitesimal motions in @xmath112 and @xmath113 of the above . from this consideration",
    "it is clear that the movement in @xmath113 corresponds to an _ odd _",
    "solution ( and so ruled out by our symmetry assumptions ) with a unique root at @xmath114 , while movement in @xmath112 corresponds to an _ even _ solution with two roots .",
    "we can easily obtain the explicit form of these two solutions by formally taking derivatives relative to @xmath115 after expressing in the coordinates .",
    "this yields @xmath116 one sees easily from the asymptotic behavior that neither of these functions belong to @xmath93 .",
    "the fact that the solutions @xmath117 do not belong to @xmath93 implies that we do not have to modulate .",
    "in other words , the individual elements of our two parameter family are `` infinitely far '' from one another ( this can be seen from their asymptotic behavior ) and we do not need to track the `` motion along the soliton manifold '' for our analysis .",
    "we lastly consider the possible discrete spectrum below 0 . by testing with bump functions we easily see that there must be a negative eigenvalue . by the sturm - picone comparison theorem ( * ? ?",
    "* section 10.6 ) and the explicit solutions above , we see that the eigenvalue is unique , and its eigenfunction is nowhere vanishing ( it is the ground state ) .",
    "we call this eigenfunction @xmath118 and its associated eigenvalue @xmath119 .",
    "( numerically @xmath120 . )",
    "note that @xmath36 is smooth , and decays exponentially as @xmath121 .    in the sequel",
    "we let @xmath122 denote the projection onto the ground state @xmath36 , and @xmath123 the projection onto the continuous spectrum . noting that @xmath36 contributes an exponentially growing mode to the linear evolution",
    ", we can not expect to have stability for any perturbation .",
    "instead , we will show that given a sufficiently small initial perturbation @xmath124 , we can adjust its projection to the ground state @xmath125 while keeping @xmath126 unchanged so as to guarantee global existence and asymptotic vanishing of the solution . in the analysis we will treat the continuous part and the discrete part of the spectrum separately .",
    "we will describe the linear decay estimates for the continuous part of the solution in section [ sect : linear ] .",
    "this will be combined with the analysis of the nonlinear terms ( in the spirit of section [ subsec : nonlin ] ) to derive _ a priori estimates _ assuming that the discrete part of the solution is well behaved .",
    "finally we will close the argument in section [ sec : existencea ] by showing that such a good choice of initial @xmath125 is possible .      for the sequel , we shall use the following key energy and decay estimates associated with the evolution of the operator @xmath99 , which are proved in @xcite . recall that we take @xmath127 to be the projection to the continuous part of the spectrum of @xmath99 .",
    "in the sequel , we shall frequently use the notations ( as well as variations thereof ) @xmath128 for various norms @xmath129 . by these expressions",

    "the values @xmath153 are weighted estimates factoring in spatial localizations .",

    "this is given by the following    [ eq : keyest3 ] we have the space - time bounds @xmath159 the inhomogeneous version with source terms of gradient structure is as follows : @xmath160    these linear estimates were proven in @xcite for a large class of @xmath161 dimensional wave equations with potentials .",
    "the main technique used there is that of the _ distorted fourier transform _ , which is essentially the representation of solutions as superpositions of generalized eigenfunctions of the linear operator @xmath99 ( analogous to how the fourier transform represents functions as superpositions of generalized eigenfunctions of the laplacian ) . when restricted to the continuous part of the spectrum , this representation allows the use of oscillatory integral techniques to obtain dispersive estimates .",
    "part of the difficulty in implementing this process is in analyzing the spectral measure and obtain suitable descriptions of the generalized eigenfunctions .",
    "these are done in detail in @xcite .    to control the decay rate of the nonlinear evolution , in addition to the standard dispersive bounds we also need a variation of the _ vector field method _ to take advantage of the algebraic structure of the nonlinearities .",
