    "waiting time distributions between quantum events were first introduced in quantum mechanics by srinivas and davies in 1981 to describe photon counting experiments @xcite .",
    "their work was an extension of early work by mollow et al .",
    "in quantum statistics @xcite . while photon counting experiments were traditionally treated classically , a quantum mechanical description is needed to incorporate the continuous measurements of photodetectors .",

    "his version of the waiting time formalism forms the basis of our discussion in the following sections .    in this paper",
    "we propose a physical quantity - the tunnelling time distribution - which provides new physical information and is sensitive to details of electron transport processes .",
    "the tunnelling time distribution is a  spin - off \" quantity from the waiting time distribution between photon detections ( discussed in quantum optics since early 80s ) and the waiting time distribution between electric current spikes @xcite .",
    "the first moment of the tunnelling time distribution is the average tunnelling time , which is the average time that an electron spends in the molecule before it is transferred into the source electrode .",
    "the unambiguous definition of the average tunnelling time has been a much debated topic in physics @xcite .",
