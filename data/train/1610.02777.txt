    "however , to understand the nature of our universe , it is paramount to enlighten the behavior of these fundamental substances . amazingly , an answer came a few decades ago , in the form of the @xmath20-@xmath21-@xmath22-@xmath23-@xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) evolution equations , @xcite , @xmath32 ,      \\nonumber \\\\",

    "they depend on the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of parent hadron ( @xmath17 ) and an ultra - violet cutoff ( @xmath35 ) , related to the virtuality of the exchanged particle during the inelastic scattering ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "@xmath37 represents the @xmath10 running coupling constant of the strong interaction , conventionally approximated as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of involving flavours in the given strong interaction and @xmath40 is the @xmath2 fundamental low energy scale . the value of @xmath40 can be effectively extracted from experiment , around @xmath41 @xmath42 . in the @xmath10 @xmath2 ,",
    "the probability of the emission of a parton ( a ) from a parent parton ( b ) is being parameterized through the splitting functions : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the ratio of the longitudinal fractions of two successive partons . of coarse the extension of this",
    "probability functions to the @xmath11 would be more complected , see the section ii-3 of the reference @xcite .",
    "additionally , the terms on the right - hand side of the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , correspond to the real emission and the virtual contributions , respectively .",
    "the @xmath25 evolution equation , is based on the @xmath45 assumption , summing over the @xmath46 contributions along the chain of evolution and systematically neglecting the transverse momentum of the emitted partons .",
    "it has been repeatedly hinted that undermining the contributions coming from the transverse momentum of the partons may severely harm the precision of the calculations , especially in the high energy processes in the small-@xmath17 region , see for example the references @xcite .",
    "therefore and to rectify this problem , some transverse momentum dependent ( @xmath47 ) evolution equations have been established , e.g. the @xmath48-@xmath49-@xmath50-@xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and the @xmath28-@xmath29-@xmath30-@xmath22 ( @xmath31 ) evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath52 evolution equation reads as , @xmath53 where the term @xmath54 imposes a physical constraint , enforcing the increase of the emission angle of the gluons in the successive radiations along the evolution chain .",
    "this condition which is usually referred to as the angular ordering constraint ( @xmath26 ) , is due to the coherent radiation of the gluons .",
    "the @xmath55 form factor , @xmath56 , gives the probability of evolving from a scale @xmath57 to a scale @xmath58 , without any partons emissions , and can be defined as : @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "the parametric function @xmath61 acts as an initial state for the evolution equation and usually is related to contributions from the non - perturbative region , i.e. the region with @xmath62 . in the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath63 is the double - scaled @xmath52 @xmath47 @xmath16 , which in addition to the @xmath17 and @xmath58 , depends on the transverse momentum of the incoming partons , @xmath1 .",
    "the idea behind the @xmath52 evolution equation ( to make the use of the @xmath26 in the evolution ladder ) is valid only in the case of gluon - dominant processes , i.e. in the small-@xmath17 sector .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath52 equation will reduce to the conventional @xmath25 and @xmath31 evolution by the means of inserting the proper physical boundaries , @xcite .",
    "mathematically speaking , solving the @xmath52 equation is rather difficult , usually possible with the help of monte carlo event generators , references @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the main feature of the @xmath52 equation , i.e. the @xmath26 , can be exclusively used for the gluon evolution and therefore , producing convincing quark contributions in this framework is only a recent development @xcite . to overcome these obstacles , martin et al , employing the idea of @xmath64 evolution , introduced the @xmath1-factorization framework and developed the @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) approaches @xcite , both of which are constructed around the solutions of the @xmath10 @xmath25 evolution equations and modified with different visualizations of the angular ordering constraint .",
    "although the @xmath65 parton distribution functions ( @xmath0 ) of @xmath9 in the leading order ( @xmath10 ) and next - to - leading order ( @xmath11 ) have been defined to improve the compatibility of the @xmath7 approach with the theory of the @xmath10 @xmath25 and extend it to a higher order @xmath2 , the recent work suggests that the the @xmath7 framework is more successful ( or at least as successful ) in describing experimental data , see for example the references @xcite . nevertheless , to utter a rigid statement on this matter , further investigation is required .",
    "one extraordinary test ground for the @xmath0 of the @xmath1-factorization is the probe of the forward - center and forward - forward rapidity sectors in the hadronic collisions , given that it involves the dynamics of the small-@xmath17 region , e.g. @xmath66 , where the gluon density dominates . since the decisive difference between the @xmath0 of @xmath7 and @xmath9 is in the different manifestations of the @xmath26 , one could argue that working in such phenomenological setups could potentially exploit this diversity and unveil the true capacities of the presumed frameworks . for this propose , we have calculated the process of production of di - jets in the inelastic proton - proton collisions from the forward - center and forward - forward rapidity regions , utilizing the @xmath0 of @xmath7 and @xmath9 in the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 ( for a complete introduction to the framework of @xmath1-factorization and the prescriptions for the @xmath7 and the @xmath9 @xmath0 , the reader may refer to the reference @xcite ) . comparing these results with each other , with the results of the similar calculations in other frameworks",
    "( see the references @xcite ) and with the experimental data , namely the data from @xmath67 collaboration @xcite , would provide an excellent opportunity to study the strength and the weaknesses of the @xmath0 in the @xmath1-factorization . to find some recent developments in the theory of @xmath1-factorization , the reader is referred to the references @xcite .",
    "the outlook of this paper is as follows : section [ seciii ] contains a comprehensive description over the utilities and the means for the calculation of the @xmath1-dependent cross - section of the di - jets production in the p - p @xmath36 processes .",
    "the necessary numerical analysis will be presented in section [ seciv ] , after which a thorough conclusion will follow in section the [ secv ] .",
    "general speaking , the main contributions into the hadronic cross - section of the di - jet productions at the @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath68 are the @xmath10 partonic sub - processes : @xmath69 in the collinear factorization framework , the cross - section of a hadronic @xmath36 can be written as a sum over all of the involving partonic cross - sections , times the probability of appearing the particular partonic configuration at top of the evolution ladder of the individual hadrons , i.e. , @xmath70      & & \\times \\hat{\\sigma}_{a_1- a_2}(x_1,k^2_{1,t}=0,\\mu_1 ^ 2;x_2,k^2_{2,t}=0,\\mu_2 ^ 2),\\nonumber\\\\      \\label{eq20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath71 being the solutions of the @xmath25 equation times @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "@xmath74 denotes the cross - section of the incoming partons @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively with the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the hard scales @xmath79 and @xmath80 and neglected transverse momenta .",
    "@xmath74 may be defined as follows : @xmath81 with the multi - particle phase space @xmath82 , @xmath83 and the flux factor @xmath84 , @xmath85 @xmath86 is the center of mass energy squared , @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 being the 4-momenta of the incoming hadrons , where we have neglected the mass of the proton , while working in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "@xmath90 in the equation ( [ eq21 ] ) are the matrix elements of the partonic sub - processes , the equations ( [ eq19 ] ) . to calculate these quantities , one must first understand the exact kinematics that rule over the corresponding partonic sub - processes .    to include the contributions coming from the transverse momentum dependency of the probability functions",
    ", one can use the definition of the @xmath0 in the framework of @xmath1-factorization , @xcite , @xmath91 and rewrite the equation ( [ eq20 ] ) as follows : @xmath92 & &      \\times \\hat{\\sigma}_{a_1 a_2}(x_1,k^2_{1,t},\\mu_1 ^ 2;x_2,k^2_{2,t},\\mu_2 ^ 2 ) .",
    "\\label{eq24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , it is convenient to characterize @xmath82 in term of the transverse momenta of the product particles , @xmath93 , their rapidities , @xmath94 , and the azimuthal angles of the emissions , @xmath95 , @xmath96 working in the proton - proton center of mass frame , one may use the following kinematics , @xmath97 where the @xmath98 are the 4-momenta of the partons that enter the semi - hard process . then , for each partonic sub - process , the law of the transverse momentum conservation reads , @xmath99 afterwards , one can simply define , @xmath100    the figure [ fig2 ] illustrates the schematics for a proton - proton deep inelastic collision in the forward - center ( or the forward - forward ) rapidity sector in a particular partonic sub - process , i.e. @xmath101 . working within the boundaries of the forward - center or the forward - forward rapidity sector , without damaging the main assumptions , one can assume that @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in the direct consequent of a such approximation , we can safely neglect the transverse momentum dependency of the first parton entering the hard process ( shift it to the collinear domain ) , and rewrite the equation ( [ eq24 ] ) as , @xmath104 & &      \\times \\hat{\\sigma}_{a_1 a_2}(x_1,\\mu_1 ^ 2;x_2,k^2_{t},\\mu_2 ^ 2 ) ,      \\label{eq29}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the @xmath1 being defined as , @xmath105^{1/2 } ,      \\label{eq30}\\ ] ] and @xmath106 .",
    "after determining the kinematics of the involving processes , it is possible calculate their matrix elements , i.e. @xmath107 . to this end , one have to sum over the @xmath108 terms only from the ladder - type diagrams , and somehow systematically dispose the interference ( the non - ladder ) diagrams , e.g. by using a physical gauge for the gluons , @xmath109 note that @xmath110 is the gauge - fixing vector .",
    "one might expect that neglecting the contributions coming from the non - ladder diagrams , i.e. the diagrams where the production of the jets is a by - product of the hadronic collision ( see the reference @xcite ) , would have a numerical effect on the results .",
    "nevertheless , employing the gauge choice ( [ eq31 ] ) , one finds out that the contribution from the `` unfactorizable '' non - ladder diagrams vanishes .",
    "thus , using the regular feynman rules , inserting the `` non - sense '' polarization for the incoming gluons @xmath111 and imposing the `` eikonal '' approximation to justify the use of an on - shell prescription for the off - shell particles ( via neglecting the exchanged momenta in the quark - gluon vertices and preserving the spin of the gluons , see the references @xcite ) , @xmath112 one can manage to extract the matrix element , corresponding to the processes of the equation ( [ eq19 ] ) , see the appendix a.    now , using the above equations , one can derive the master equation for the total cross - section of the production of di - jets in the framework of @xmath1-factorization , @xmath113 & &      \\times \\ ; f_{g}(x_2,k^2_{t},\\mu^2 )   \\ ;      |\\mathcal{m}_{a+g \\to c+d}(x_1,\\mu^2;x_2,k^2_{t})|^2 .      \\label{eq34}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term @xmath114 restrains the over - counting indices .",
    "note that , the existence of the term @xmath115 in the equation ( [ eq34 ] ) is the remnant of the re - summation factor , @xmath116 , from the equation ( [ eq6 ] ) and since we are interested to look for the transverse momentum dependent jets with @xmath117 , the presence of such denominator would not cause any complication in the master equation .",
    "additionally , we have to decide how to validate our @xmath0 in the the non - perturbative region .",
    "i.e. where @xmath118 with @xmath119 . a natural option would be to fulfill the requirement that : @xmath120 and therefore , one can safely choose the following approximation for the non - perturbative region : @xmath121    in the next section , we will introduce some of the numerical methods that have been used for the calculation of the cross - section of the production of di - jets , using the @xmath0 of @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "we perform the 5-fold integration of the master equation ( [ eq34 ] ) , using the @xmath122 algorithm in monte - carlo integration . to do this ,",
    "we have selected the hard - scale of the @xmath0 as the share of each of the parent hadrons from the total energy of the center - of - mass frame : @xmath123 variating this normalization value around a factor of 2 , will provide each framework with a decent uncertainty bound .",
    "one would also set the upper boundaries on the transverse momentum integrations to @xmath124 , noting that increasing this upper value does not have any effect on the outcome .",
    "the forward rapidity sectors is conventionally defined as , @xmath125 where @xmath126 denotes the pseudorapidity of a produced particle , @xmath127,\\ ] ] with @xmath128 being the angle between the propagation axis and the momentum of the particle .",
    "alternatively , to work in the central rapidity sector , one have to choose , @xmath129 therefore , while working in the infinite momentum frame i.e. where @xmath130 , to perform our calculations in the forward - center region , we set : @xmath131 trivially , the choice @xmath132 marks the forward - forward region . such framework should be ideal to describe the inclusive @xmath67 data regarding the forward - center di - jet measurements for @xmath133 . after confirming that , one can go further , producing predictions in the framework of forward - forward di - jet production for the @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , as a consequence of employing the inclusive scenario ( i.e. @xmath133 and limiting the rapidity integrations to the forward or central regions ) , one must assure that the produced jets must lie within this specific region .",
    "thus , in order to cut - off the collinear and the soft singularities , it is conventional to use the anti-@xmath1 algorithm @xcite , with radius @xmath134 , bounding the jets to this particular initial setup , through inserting a constraint on the @xmath135 plane : @xmath136^{1/2}.      \\label{eq39}\\ ] ] introducing the anti-@xmath1 jet constraint ensures the production of 2 separated jets and rejects any single - jet scenarios .",
    "having in mind the theory and the notions of the previous sections , we are able to calculated the production rates belonging to the di - jets in the forward - center and the forward - forward rapidity sectors , from the perspective of the @xmath1-factorization framework , utilizing the @xmath0 of @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath16 of martin et al @xcite , @xmath15 , in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are used as the input functions for the unintegrated gluon densities , i.e. , the equations ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) of the reference @xcite . additionally , they are fit to be used as the solutions of the @xmath25 , the @xmath16 of the collinear factorization , directly in the master equation ( [ eq34 ] ) .",
    "we tend to perform the above calculations in any of our presumed frameworks , the @xmath7 , the @xmath10 @xmath9 and the @xmath11 @xmath9 , then compare the results to each other , to the similar calculations in other frameworks and to the existing experimental data , in the case of the forward - center .",
    "so , the figures [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] present the reader with the differential cross - section for the production of well - separated forward - central di - jets ( @xmath137 ) , plotted against the transverse momentum of the corresponding jets ( @xmath138 ) in the @xmath7 , the @xmath10 @xmath9 and the @xmath11 @xmath9 schemes respectively .",
    "the uncertainty bounds are calculated , variating the hard scale of the @xmath139 with a factor of 2 , since this is the only arbitrary physical parameter in the framework of @xmath1-factorization . the blue - hatched pattern , the green - checkered and the red - vertically stripped patterns illustrate the individual contributions of the partonic sub - processes from the equation ( [ eq19 ] ) , corresponding to the @xmath140 , @xmath101 and @xmath141 processes respectively .",
    "the black - horizontally stripped pattern represents the sum of the sub - contributions .",
    "the calculations have been compared against the experimental data of the @xmath67 collaboration , the reference @xcite .",
    "one immediately notices that the share of the @xmath140 sub - process dominates , relative to the negligible shares of the remaining two sub - processes .",
    "although all of these frameworks are relatively successful in describing the experimental data , see the figure [ fig6 ] , it is interesting to find that the @xmath0 of @xmath7 do as well as ( if not better than ) the @xmath0 of @xmath9 in predicting the experimental results .",
    "the closeness of the behavior of different frameworks is a consequence of our choice for the hard scale of the @xmath0 , equation ( [ eq36 ] ) . in order to enlighten this point",
    ", the figure [ fig7 ] illustrates the result of making different choices in such calculations , using the @xmath0 of the @xmath7 . to demonstrate the effect of changing the hard scale of the @xmath0 in the outcome",
    ", the histograms are calculated utilizing the following hard scale prescriptions @xmath142 where @xmath143 returns the higher value between the transverse momenta of the produced jets . to save computation time",
    ", we only considered the contributions coming form the dominant @xmath144 sub - processes . the choice @xmath145 , which have been used in the similar calculations ( e.g. , the references @xcite in the high energy factorization , from the point of view of the @xmath0 of the color gloss condensation , ( @xmath146 ) ) proves to be in contrast with the particular manifestation of the @xmath26 , specially in the case of @xmath11 @xmath9 @xmath0 .",
    "this is in addition to the considerable off - shoot of the results in the smaller values of the transverse momenta belonging to the produced jets . in the figure [ fig6 ] , the yellow - checkered and the purple - vertically stripped patters represent the calculations in the linear and the non - linear @xmath147 frameworks , respectively .",
    "the above separation between the predictions of the @xmath147 framework and the experimental data is apparent . to avoid such complications ,",
    "we have chosen the condition @xmath148 , in the [ eq40 ] , as the primary prescription for the hard scale of our @xmath0 throughout this work , see the section [ seciv ] .",
    "having a closer look into the figure [ fig6 ] , one notices that such off - shooting results also appear in our settings for the production of di - jets .",
    "this is perhaps because of the over - simplified dynamics that have been used to derive these measurements .",
    "an increase in the precision may be realized via including higher order diagrams and introducing the final state parton showers in this frameworks , @xcite . beside this point , note that our results show an acceptable agreement with the experimental data of the @xmath67 collaboration , reference @xcite .",
    "another interesting observation is that in the large @xmath1 , where the higher order corrections become important , the calculations in the @xmath7 approach start to separate from the @xmath149 and behave similar to the @xmath150 .",
    "the reason is that the inclusion of the @xmath151 splitting functions into the domain of the @xmath26 introduces some corrections from the @xmath11 region ( in the form of @xmath152 resummations ) into the @xmath7 formalism .    a recent report from the @xmath67 collaboration , the reference @xcite , concerns the angular distribution of the produced jets in the forward - center rapidity sector from a deep inelastic event at the @xmath3 .",
    "making use of this new information , we have calculated the differential cross - section of the forward - central di - jet production ( @xmath153 ) , plotted in the figure [ fig8 ] against the angular difference of the produced partons ( or equivalently the angular difference of the produced jets , @xmath154 ) . the panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in this figure",
    "illustrate the details of the calculations in each framework , consisting of the individual contributions of the sub - processes and the corresponding uncertainty bounds .",
    "the panel ( d ) presents the reader with the comparison of the total amounts in the presumed formalisms to each other and to the data from the reference @xcite .",
    "again , the results in the @xmath7 approach seems to be equally good ( or better than ) those from the @xmath9 in the @xmath10 or the @xmath11 .    after proving the success of our formalism in describing the experimental data for the production of di - jets in the forward - center rapidity region",
    ", we can move forward with the prediction of a similar event , in the forward - forward sector , i.e. by choosing the rapidity of the produced jets ( @xmath155 and @xmath156 ) to be both in the boundaries that where specified within the equation ( [ eq37 ] ) . therefore , in the figure [ fig9 ] the reader is presented with our predictions regarding the dependency of the differential cross - section of the forward - forward di - jet production ( @xmath157 ) to the transverse momenta of the produced jets ( @xmath138 ) , in the framework of @xmath1-factorization .",
    "the panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of the figure illustrate these predictions in the @xmath7 , the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 formalisms , respectively .",
    "the contributions of the individual partonic sub - processes are included . these contributions",
    "have the same general behavior as in the forward - central case , in spite of the fact that the measured contribution for the @xmath140 and the @xmath158 sub - processes are closer , compared to their counterparts from the forward - center region , @xmath159 in addition , one can clearly perceive the effect of the @xmath160 constraint in the @xmath19 results , causing a steep descend in the corresponding histograms , in contrast with the behaviors of the results of the @xmath7 and the @xmath18 formalisms .",
    "again , the similarity of the predictions of the @xmath7 and the @xmath18 schemes are a consequence of our choice of the hard scale , @xmath161 .",
    "such similarity was also observed else where , e.g. the references @xcite , specially in the smaller @xmath17 domains .",
    "the panel ( d ) of the figure [ fig9 ] represents a comparison between the results of the @xmath1-factorization with the results from other frameworks , namely the balitsky - kovchegov @xmath47 @xmath16 convoluted with the running coupling corrections ( @xmath162 , see the references @xcite ) and the kutak - sapeta @xmath47 @xmath16 ( @xmath147 ) , the reference @xcite .",
    "both of these frameworks are specially designed to describe the behavior of the small - x region , incorporating the non - linear evolution of the unintegrated parton densities with the @xmath147 framework and the high energy factorization ( @xmath163 ) formalism , in accordance with the @xmath31 iterative evolution equation . in the absence of any experimental data ,",
    "we refrain ourselves from any assessments regarding these results .",
    "nevertheless , the predictions of the @xmath7 scheme ( because of its previous success ) may provide a base line for a sound comparison .",
    "also , the singular behavior of the @xmath19 results may appear undesirable .",
    "similar predictions are presented in the figures [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] , describing the dependency of the differential cross - section of the forward - forward di - jet production , to the angle of the produced jets ( @xmath164 to @xmath165 in the figure [ fig10 ] ) and to their rapidity ( @xmath166 to @xmath167 in the figure [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "the notions of these diagrams are as in the figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "the panel ( d ) of each figure includes the comparison of the @xmath1-factorization results to the existing results in the @xmath162 and the @xmath147 frameworks .",
    "the irregular behavior of the @xmath19 scheme in both cases , manifests itself in the form of lower values of the predicted differential cross - section .",
    "again , the reliability of these predictions lies within the excellent credit of the @xmath7 @xmath0 in describing the high energy @xmath2 events .    in summary , throughout this work",
    ", we have tested the @xmath0 of the @xmath1-factorization , namely the @xmath7 and @xmath9 formalisms in the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 , calculating the production rate of the di - jet pairs at the deep inelastic @xmath2 collisions in the forward - center rapidity sector , compared the results to the existing experimental data of the @xmath67 collaborations and to the results of other frameworks . through our analysis we have suggested that despite the theoretical advantages of the @xmath9 formalism , the @xmath7 approach performs as good as ( if not better ) behavior toward describing the experiment .",
    "this is in general agreement with our previous findings , the references @xcite .",
    "additionally , one can clearly see that the @xmath7 or @xmath168 prescription work better than the @xmath147 in describing the experiment . based on these observations",
    "one concludes that the hard - scale dependence should be necessarily included in @xmath47 analysis .",
