    "by observing the temperature anisotropy of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the wmap collaboration reported that the density parameter of dark matter ( dm ) or cold dark matter ( cdm ) @xmath0 is @xmath1 at 68 % c.l .",
    "@xcite where @xmath2 is the normalized hubble constant .",
    "one of the most popular candidates for dm is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in supersymmetric theories with r - parity .",
    "recent studies showed that big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) puts interesting limitations on the candidates of lsp dm .",
    "a long - lived next lsp ( nlsp ) whose lifetime is longer than @xmath3 sec is dangerous for the successful bbn because the decaying nlsp produces a lot of ( high - energy ) daughter particles such as photons and hadrons during / after bbn , which can destroy @xmath4he ( and d ) and non - thermally produce another light elements copiously  @xcite . in particular , a non - thermal hadron emission due to the decaying nlsp is severely constrained by the observational light - element abundances of d , @xmath4he , @xmath5li , and @xmath6li  @xcite .    in the popular case of the neutralino ( gaugino or higgsino ) lsp , as is well - known , the unstable gravitino decay puts stringent upper bound on the reheat temperature after primordial inflation , which could be problematic for various cosmological considerations , e.g. , of the inflation models .",
    "this problem can be avoided if the gravitino is the lsp .",
    "( see also  @xcite for constraints on the reheat temperature in the gravitino lsp scenario ) .",
    "however , the decays of ordinary supersymmetric particles to the gravitino turn out to be dangerous as well . the case of neutralino nlsp , because the branching ratio into hadrons is close to the order of @xmath7 , is almost excluded  @xcite by considering bbn constraints  @xcite .",
    "slepton nlsp scenarios appear much more favorable than neutralino nlsp scenarios in cosmology .",
    "although the sneutrino nlsp scenario should be possible because of the smaller hadronic and radiative decaying modes , the primordial abundance of the sneutrino is too small to satisfy the dark matter density for its daughter lsp particle  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we would need another production mechanism of the lsp in cosmology , which usually requires a fine tuning .",
    "recently , the stau nlsp scenario has been discussed a lot as there are specifically severer / more interesting problems in bbn related to the long - lived negatively charged particle  @xcite .",
    "see also long - term problems discussed in literature  @xcite and topics in doubly - charged particles  @xcite .",
    "if the lifetime of the negatively charged particle @xmath8 such as @xmath9 is longer than 10@xmath10 sec , bound states with ambient light elements can be produced .",
    "in particular , the bound state with @xmath4he denoted by ( @xmath4he,@xmath8 ) , which is produced after 10@xmath11 sec , significantly enhances the reaction rate d+(@xmath4he,@xmath8 ) @xmath12 @xmath13li + @xmath8 + @xmath14  @xcite by a factor of @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "then @xmath13li is over - produced by the catalyzed bbn , and this scenario is severely constrained by observations  @xcite .",
    "various attempts @xcite have been made to tackle this problem and realize a successful dark matter production mechanism . in this paper",
    ", we suggest the `` flaxino '' dm as a viable option to avoid the above - mentioned difficulties for the neutralino or slepton nlsp .",
    "the flaxino is an axino - like fermion appearing in flat - direction axion models where the spontaneous breaking of peccei - quinn symmetry comes from soft supersymmetry breaking and thus all of the fermionic partners of the symmetry - breaking fields have mass of order the gravitino mass .",
    "the flaxino has a coupling to the ordinary superparticles suppressed by the axion scale @xmath16 and thus attractively leads to a fast decay of nlsp , which should be compared with the gravitino coupling suppressed by the planck scale .",
    "the strong cp problem can be naturally resolved by assuming the peccei - quinn @xmath17 symmetry spontaneously broken at the usual high scale , @xmath18 gev , and thus leads to an axion of the ksvz @xcite or dfsz type @xcite . in the supersymmetric standard model",
    ", the realization of the dfsz axion model nicely leads to the origin of the @xmath19 term @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the axion scale @xmath16 appears as the geometric mean of the planck scale and soft supersymmetry breaking scale by invoking an almost flat potential for the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking fields @xcite .",
    "for instance , let us introduce two singlet fields @xmath20 with appropriate peccei - quinn charges to allow @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the reduced planck scale .",
    "then , the @xmath19 term and axion scale can be related by @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 gev is the typical soft mass scale ( correctly @xmath26 in this model ) .",
    "this is below the scale @xmath27 gev required to make the axion the cdm .",
    "this model contains two scalar flatons @xmath28 , one pseudoscalar flaton @xmath29 , and two flatinos @xmath30 .",
    "this kind of flat dfsz axion models lead to thermal inflation @xcite and the model parameters are rather severely constrained in order to avoid the over - production of unwanted relics like axions or the lsp after thermal inflation @xcite .",
    "an interesting collider implication of such models has been pointed out in ref .",
    "the lsp can be some linear combination of the fermionic parts of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which we now call `` flaxino '' ( denoted by @xmath33 ) , and then the usual neutralino or stau nlsp decays to the flaxino mainly through its mixing with higgsinos driven by the @xmath19 term . although the corresponding decay lengths can be larger than the size of detectors , the copious production of the nlsps in future colliders may enable us to observe their decays for the low axion scale @xmath34 gev @xcite .",
    "the general idea of the axino dm has been put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also a recent related paper  @xcite ) .    some of the current authors have investigated the scenario of the `` flaxino '' lsp and the neutralino nlsp in the flat dfsz axion models using gravity - mediated susy breaking  @xcite .",
    "the axino lsp in ksvz type models has been considered in ref .",
    "the ksvz type models ( hadronic axion models ) do not agree with the framework of the flat - direction models because of the overproduction of the flaxino abundance , which is excluded by bbn @xcite . extending the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite where the neutralino nlsp is assumed , we will consider the possibility of the stau nlsp which is also allowed in a large parameter space of the mssm with the minimal supergravity scheme .",
    "let us first note that the dfsz models predict a shorter lifetime of the stau nlsp compared to the ksvz models since the stau ",
    "axino / flaxino coupling arises at tree level in the former case and at one - loop level in the latter . as we will see later , even in the case of @xmath35 gev",
    ", the stau lifetime does not exceed 10@xmath11 sec for typical mass scales of susy particles in the dfsz axion models and does not induce the @xmath13li over - production problem .",
    "this is a distinct feature of the dfsz axion models .",
    "recall that the usual upper bound , @xmath36 gev , can be relaxed in late - time entropy production scenarios such as thermal inflation models which we are considering at present .    from the viewpoint of detectabilities of a superparticle at large hadron collider ( lhc ) ,",
    "such a long - lived charged particle is promising as it can be easily traced within the detector .",
    "moreover , quite recently refs .",
    "@xcite have discussed aggressive future plans to place new stopper , e.g. , 5 - 10 meter wall made of iron , water tanks , rocks and so on , outside regular detectors in lhc such as atlas or cms to electromagnetically stop the produced staus .",
    "if these plans are realized , we will be able to measure the stau s lifetime even if its decay length is longer than the size of the detectors ( @xmath37 m ) , and reconstruct the track of the neutral lsp by catching other daughter particles . then , according to a similar discussion in brandenburg et al s analysis  @xcite , observing three - body decay of the staus will enable us to distinguish between signals of the axino / flaxino lsp and the gravitino lsp .",
    "we refer to @xcite for another topics of axino dm and gauge - mediation supersymmetry breaking models , and ref .",
    "@xcite for general cosmological constraints on a decaying saxion or flaton .",
    "see also @xcite for an inverted mass case such as the axino nlsp and the neutralino lsp , and @xcite for the gravitino nlsp and the axino lsp in gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the lifetime of the stau nlsp which decays into the flaxino lsp @xmath33 in the dfsz axion models . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we show only mixing between @xmath38 and the usual four neutralino components ; bino , wino , and two higgsinos .",

    "the big difference from the gravitino dark matter scenario is that the flaxino / axino coupling ( @xmath151 ) is much larger than the gravitino coupling ( @xmath152 ) , which makes the stau nlsp decay much faster . in the dfsz axion model",

    "are constrained by various cosmological considerations , we identified the region of the stop and stau masses which is compatible with the required dark matter density . within the conventional bound on the axion scale @xmath153 gev ,",
    "the stau decay to the flaxino lsp never becomes dangerous for bbn .",
    "furthermore , with the chosen parameter sets in the first case ( @xmath135 ) , the stau decay length turns out to be @xmath154(1 ) m so that a fair number of stau decays can be captured in colliders when the axion scale is close to its lower bound , @xmath155 gev . in the second case ( @xmath121 ) , the flaxino lsp is naturally realized in the broad parameter space of the squark mass .",
    "although the decay length is longer than @xmath154(10 ) m , the additional detectors proposed by @xcite will catch the staus even in this case .",
    "let us finally remark that , in our scheme , the unstable gravitino decaying to ordinary superparticle or flaxino does not contradict with bbn as the primordial gravitino abundance will be diluted away by the entropy production after thermal inflation caused by the flat direction in the model .",

    "<S> if the spontaneous breaking of peccei - quinn symmetry comes from soft supersymmetry breaking , the fermionic partners of the symmetry - breaking fields have mass of order the gravitino mass , and are called flatinos . </S>",
    "<S> the lightest flatino , called here the flaxino , is a cdm candidate if it is the lightest supersymmetric particle . </S>",
    "<S> we here explore flaxino dark matter assuming that the lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle is the stau , with gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the stau to the flaxino is fast enough not to spoil the standard predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis , and its track and decay can be seen in future colliders . </S>"
