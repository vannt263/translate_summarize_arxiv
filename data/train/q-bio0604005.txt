    "cells process information from the outside and regulate their internal state by means of proteins and dna that chemically and physically interact with one another .",
    "these biochemical networks are often highly stochastic , because in living cells the reactants often occur in small numbers .",
    "this is particularly important in gene expression  @xcite , where transcription factors are frequently present in copy numbers as low as tens of molecules per cell .",
    "while it is generally believed that biochemical noise can be detrimental to cell function  @xcite , it is increasingly becoming recognized that noise can also be beneficial to the organism  @xcite . understanding noise in gene expression",
    "is thus important for understanding cell function , and this observation has recently stimulated much theoretical and experimental work in this direction  @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical analyses usually employ the zero - dimensional chemical master equation  @xcite .",
    "this approach takes into account the discrete character of the reactants and the probabilistic nature of chemical reactions .",
    "it does assume , however , that the cell is a ` well - stirred ' reactor , in which the particles are uniformly distributed in space at all times ; the reaction rates only depend upon the global concentrations of the reactants and not upon the spatial positions of the reactant molecules .",
    "yet , in order to react , reactants first have to move towards one another .",
    "they do so by diffusion , or , in the case of eukaryotes , by a combination of diffusion and active transport .",
    "both processes are stochastic in nature and this could contribute to the noise in the network . here , we study by computer simulation the expression of a single gene that is under the control of a repressor @xmath0 in a spatially - resolved model .",
    "we find that at low repressor concentration , _",
    "@xmath1 < 50 { \\rm nm}$ ] , the noise in gene expression is dominated by the noise arising from the diffusive motion of the repressor molecules . our results thus show that spatial fluctuations of the reactants can be an important source of noise in biochemical networks .",
    "our analysis reveals that in gene expression significant fluctuations occur on both small and large length and time scales .",
    "as expected from earlier work  @xcite , the fluctuations on long time scales are predominantly due to protein degradation ; we assume that proteins are degraded by dilution , which means that the relaxation rate of this process is on the order of an hour .",
    "our results , however , also elucidate an important process on much smaller length and time scales .",
    "it is associated with the competition between repressor and rna polymerase ( rnap ) for binding to the promoter .",
    "when a repressor molecule dissociates from the dna , it can rebind very rapidly , _",
    "i.e. _ on a time scale of microseconds , or less .",
    "this rebinding time is so short that when a repressor molecule has just dissociated , the probability that a rnap will bind before the repressor molecule rebinds , is very small . as a result",
    ", a repressor molecule will on average rebind many times , before it eventually diffuses away from the promoter and a rnap molecule , or another repressor molecule , can bind to the promoter .",
    "this process of rapid rebindings decreases the effective dissociation rate , and this increases the noise in gene expression .",
    "clearly , fluctuations in gene expression span orders of magnitude in length and time scales .",
    "this means that the simulation technique should be sufficiently detailed to resolve the events at small length and time scales , yet also efficient enough to access the long length and time scales .",
    "recently , several simulation techniques have been developed for the stochastic modeling of reaction - diffusion systems  @xcite .",
    "these techniques , however , do not satisfy both criteria : they either describe the system in a coarse - grained way , _",
    "i.e. _ on the level of local concentrations rather than single particles  @xcite , or are too slow to accurately model the dynamics on the long time scales  @xcite .",
    "our simulations have been made possible via the use of our recently developed green s function reaction dynamics ( gfrd ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "gfrd is an event driven algorithm that uses green s functions to combine in one step the propagation of the particles in space with the reactions between them .",
    "the event - driven nature of the algorithm makes it particularly useful for problems , such as gene expression , in which the events are distributed over a wide range of length and time scales : the algorithm takes small steps when the reactants are close to each other  such as when a repressor molecule has just dissociated from the dna  while it takes large jumps in time and space when the molecules are far apart from each other  like when the repressor molecule has eventually diffused away from the promoter .",
    "the event - driven nature of gfrd makes it orders of magnitude more efficient than brute - force particle - based algorithms  @xcite and this has allowed us to simulate gene expression on the relevant biological time scales of hours .",
    "several publications @xcite have discussed the effect of fluctuations in the binding of transcription factors to their site on the dna ( called operator ) on the noise in gene expression .",
    "most of these models are relatively simple , ignoring , for instance , production of mrna @xcite .",
    "moreover all these studies , with the exception of @xcite , ignore the role of the spatial fluctuations of the transcription factors .",
    "our aim is to study gene expression in a biologically meaningful model .",
    "we have therefore constructed a rather detailed model , although we will also use minimal models that can be studied analytically , in order to interpret the simulation results .",
    "the full model , which is described in the next section , contains the diffusive motion of repressor molecules , open complex formation , promoter clearance , transcription elongation and translation  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : simres ] , we discuss the simulation results for both the noise in mrna and protein level .",
    "the results reveal that for @xmath1<50 { \\rm nm}$ ] , the noise in the spatially - resolved model can be more than five times larger than the noise in the well - stirred model .",
    "we also show that a cell could minimize the effect of spatial fluctuations , either by tuning the open complex formation rate or by changing the number of repressors and their affinity for the binding site on the dna . in section  [ sec :",
    "operbind ] , we elucidate the origin of the enhanced noise in the spatially resolved model . in the subsequent section , we show that in the model employed here the effect of spatial fluctuations can be quantitatively described by a well - stirred model in which the reaction rates for repressor binding and unbinding are appropriately renormalized ; however , as we discuss in the last section , we expect that in a more refined model the effect of diffusion will be more complex , impeding such a simplified description . in section  [ sec : ps ] , we discuss how the operator state fluctuations propagate through the different stages of gene expression using power spectra for the operator state , elongation complex , mrna and protein .",
    "the results show that these power spectra are highly useful for unraveling the dynamics of gene expression .",
    "we hope that this stimulates experimentalists to measure power spectra of not only mrna and protein levels  @xcite , but also of the dynamics of transcription initiation and elongation using _",
    "e.g. _ magnetic tweezers  @xcite . as we argue in the last section",
    ", such experiments should make it possible to determine the importance of spatial fluctuations for the noise in gene expression .",
    "we explicitly simulate the diffusive motion of the repressor molecules in space . however , since the experiments of riggs _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and the theoretical work of berg , winter , and von hippel  @xcite , it is well known that proteins could find their target sites via a combination of 1d sliding along the dna and 3d diffusion through the cytoplasm ",
    "`` hopping '' or `` jumping '' from one site on the dna to another .",
    "this mechanism could speed up the search process and make it faster than the rate at which particles find their target by free 3d diffusion ; this rate is given by @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath3 is the cross section , which is on the order of a protein diameter or dna diameter , @xmath4 is the diffusion constant of the protein in the cytoplasm , and @xmath1 $ ] is the concentration of the ( repressor ) protein .",
    "however , while it is clear that the mechanism of 3d diffusion and 1d sliding could potentially speed up the search process , whether this mechanism in living cells indeed drastically reduces the search time is still under debate  @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is instructive to discuss the two main results of recent studies on this topic  @xcite .",
    "the first is that the mean search time @xmath5 is given by  @xcite @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the total length of the dna , @xmath8 is the average distance over which the protein slides along the dna before it dissociates , @xmath9 is the diffusion constant for sliding , @xmath10 is the typical mesh size in the nucleoid , and @xmath4 is the diffusion constant in the cytoplasm .",
    "this formula has a clear interpretation  @xcite : @xmath11 is the sliding time , @xmath12 is the time spent on 3d diffusion , the sum of these terms is thus the time to perform one round of sliding and diffusion , and @xmath13 is the total number of rounds needed to find the target .",
    "the other principal result is that the search time is minimized when the sliding distance @xmath8 is @xmath14 under these conditions , a protein spends equal amounts of time on 3d diffusion and 1d sliding ( a protein is thus half the time bound to the dna ) .",
    "[ eq : lambda ] is a useful result , because it shows that the average sliding distance @xmath8 depends upon the ratio of diffusion constants and on the typical mesh size in the nucleoid .",
    "if we now assume that @xmath9 and @xmath4 are equal ( which is not obvious given that proteins bind relatively strongly to dna  @xmath9 could thus very well be much smaller than @xmath4 ) and if we take the mesh size to be given by @xmath15  @xcite , where @xmath16 is the volume of an _ escherichia coli _ cell and @xmath17 , we find that @xmath18 ( 30 bp ) .",
    "this corresponds to the typical diameter of a protein or dna double helix and is thus not very large .",
    "interestingly , recent experiments seem to confirm this : experiments from halford _",
    "et al . _ on restriction enzymes ( ecorv and bbcci ) with a series of dna substrates with two target sites and varying lengths of dna between the two sites , suggest that under the _ in vivo _ conditions , sliding is indeed limited to relatively short distances , _",
    "i.e. _ to distances less than 50 bp ( @xmath19 )  @xcite .",
    "now , it should be realized that on length scales beyond the sliding length , the motion is essentially 3d diffusion : the sliding / hopping mechanism corresponds to 3d diffusion with a jump distance given by the sliding distance  @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the sliding distance is only on the order of a particle diameter , as discussed above , we have therefore decided to model the motion of the repressor molecules as 3d diffusion .",
    "but it should be remembered that on length scales smaller than @xmath20 , this approach is not correct .",
    "we discuss the implications of this for our results in the discussion section .",
    "most repressors bind to a site that ( partially ) overlaps with the core promoter  the binding site of the rna polymerase ( rnap ) .",
    "when a repressor molecule is bound to its operator site , it prevents rnap from binding to the promoter , thereby switching off gene expression . only in the absence of a repressor on the operator site , can rnap bind to the promoter and initiate transcription and translation , ultimately resulting in the production of a protein .",
    "we model this by the following reaction network : @xmath21 eqs .",
    "[ eq : gene_exp1 ] and [ eq : gene_exp2 ] describe the competition between the binding of the repressor @xmath0 and the rnap molecules @xmath22 to the promoter ( @xmath23 is the operator site ) . in our simulation",

    "we simulate both the operator site @xmath23 and the repressor molecules as spherical particles with diameter @xmath25 nm . the operator site @xmath23 is surrounded by @xmath26 repressor molecules that move by free 3d diffusion ( see previous section ) with an effective diffusion constant @xmath27 , as has been reported for proteins of a similar size @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic forward rate @xmath28 for the repressor particles @xmath0 at contact is estimated from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xcite .",
    "the backward rate @xmath29 depends on the interaction between the dna binding site of the repressor and the operator site on the dna and varies greatly between different operons , with stronger repressors having a lower @xmath29 . in our simulations , we vary @xmath30 between @xmath31 , as discussed in more detail below .",
    "the concentration of rnap is much higher than that of the repressor  @xcite . because of this we treat the rnap as distributed homogeneously within the cell and we do not to take diffusion of rnap into account explicitly . instead ,",

    "transcription initiation is described by eqs .",
    "[ eq : gene_exp3 ] and [ eq : gene_exp4 ] . before",
    "productive synthesis of rna occurs , first the rnap in the rnap - promoter complex @xmath37 unwinds approximately one turn of the promoter dna to form the open complex @xmath38 .",
    "the open complex formation rate @xmath39 has been measured to be on the order of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we approximate open complex formation as an irreversible reaction .",
    "some experiments find this step to be weakly reversible @xcite .",
    "however , adding a backward reaction to the model did not change the dynamics of the system in a qualitative way , as long as the backward rate is smaller than @xmath39 , which is in agreement with experimental results .",
    "after open complex formation , rnap must first escape the promoter region before another rnap or repressor can bind . since elongation occurs at a rate of @xmath41 nucleotides per second and between @xmath42 nucleotides",
    "must be cleared by rnap before the promoter is accessible , a waiting time of @xmath43 is required before another binding can occur .",
    "since promoter clearance consists of many individual elongation events that obey poisson statistics individually , we model the step as one with a fixed time delay @xmath44 , not as a poisson process with rate @xmath45 .",

    ", the mrna degradation rate is determined by fixing the average mrna concentration in the unrepressed state , as described below .",

    "this means that the cell can control mrna and protein levels in the repressed state either by having a large number of repressors that stay on the dna for a short time or by having a small number of repressors , possibly even one , that stay on the dna for a long time . even though it is conceivable that the latter is preferable for economic reasons , there is no difference between the two extremes in terms of the average gene expression . in our simulations , we vary @xmath26 and @xmath58 , but use a fixed repression level @xmath78 . consequently , in the repressed state , on average @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "first , we neglect excluded volume interactions between repressor particles mutually , as the concentration of repressor is very low .",
    "this means that the only potential reaction pairs we consider are operator - repressor pairs .",
    "secondly , we use periodic boundary conditions instead of a reflecting boundary , which leads to a larger average time step . as",
    "the operator site @xmath23 is both small compared to the volume of the cell and is far removed from the cell boundary , this has no effect on the dynamics of the system . finally ,",
    "as the repressor backward rate @xmath30 is rather small , the operator site can be occupied by a repressor for a time long compared to the average simulation time step . if the repressor is bound to the operator site longer than a time @xmath81 , where @xmath7 is the length of the sides of our container , the other repressor molecules diffuse on average from one side of the box to the other .",

    "these bursts in mrna production consequently lead to peaks in protein number .",
    "as the protein decay rate is much lower than that of mrna , these peaks are followed by periods of exponential decay over the course of hours . due to these fluctuations ,",
    "protein numbers often reach levels of around @xmath88 of the protein levels in the unrepressed state . in contrast , in the absence of repressor diffusion , the fluctuations around the average protein number are much lower . for both cases ,",

    "because of the close proximity of the repressor to its binding site , it has a high probability of rapidly rebinding to , and only a small probability of diffusing away from , the binding site .",
    "at the same time , when the repressor eventually diffuses away from the operator site , the probability that the same , or more likely , another repressor diffuses to and binds the operator site is much smaller than the probability of binding in the well - stirred model , as will be shown quantitatively in sec .",

    "when a repressor binds to the operator site , due to the rapid rebindings it will remain bound effectively for a time much longer than the mrna lifetime , leading to long periods where mrna is absent in the cell .",

    "these rebindings do , however , decrease the effective rate at which the repressor molecules associate with , and dissociate from , the promoter .",
    "this increases the intensity of the extrinsic ( repressor ) noise in the low frequency regime .",
    "moreover , the low - frequency fluctuations in the repressor binding do propagate through the different stages of gene expression . in particular",
    ", they lead to sharp bursts in the production of mrna and protein .",
    "these bursts increase the noise intensity at the lower frequencies in the noise spectrum of mrna and protein . and since the noise strength @xmath179 is dominated by fluctuations in the low - frequency regime , spatial fluctuations ultimately strongly increase the noise in mrna and protein concentration .",
    "recently , experiments have been performed , in which the synthesis of individual mrna transcripts  @xcite and individual protein molecules  @xcite could be detected .",
    "the systems in these studies were very similar to that studied here : a gene under the control of a ( lac ) repressor .",
    "these studies unambiguously demonstrated that transcription  @xcite and translation can occur in bursts  @xcite .",
    "our simulation results show that spatial fluctuations of the repressor molecules might be responsible for this .",
    "indeed , our results strongly suggest that spatial fluctuations are the dominant source of noise in gene expression in these systems .",
    "the spatial fluctuations due to diffusion of the repressor molecules could have significant implications for the functioning of gene regulatory networks . under some conditions",
    ", it might be crucial that the protein number is not only low on average , but remains low at all times .",
    "for instance , if the protein itself functions as a transcription factor , it might by accident induce the expression of another gene , when , due to a fluctuation , its concentration crosses a particular activation threshold .",
    "thus , not all combinations of repressor copy number @xmath26 and repressor backward rate @xmath30 that obey eq . [ eq : repression_factor ] and thus have the same average repression strength , are necessarily equivalent in terms of function when diffusion is taken into account .",
    "if the fluctuations in the repressed state need to be small , then the cell could increase the number of repressors and decrease the binding affinity to the operator site , such that the repressor molecules stay bound to the dna only briefly .",
    "alternatively , the cell could minimize the effect of fluctuations by reducing the rate at which the open complex is formed by rnap  our analysis shows that the process of open complex formation can act as a strong low - pass filter .",
    "the rapid rebindings observed in our simulations are a general phenomenon .",
    "we now address the question when the effect of spatial fluctuations due to diffusion can be described by a well - stirred model in which the association and dissociation rates are renormalized . in the current problem , the rebinding time for a dissociated repressor is exceedingly short . as a consequence ,",
    "the probability that a rnap binds to the promoter during this time , is vanishingly small .",
    "this is precisely the reason that the effective dissociation rate is simply the bare dissociation rate divided by the number of rebindings ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : renorm3 ] ) ; the effective association rate is renormalized accordingly , because the equilibrium constant should remain unchanged ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : renorm4 ] ) .",
    "the success of the renormalized well - stirred model is thus a result of the strong separation of time scales  the time scale of repressor rebinding is well separated from that of rnap binding .",
    "the separation of time scales also makes it possible to account for the effect of spatial fluctuations by renormalizing the association and dissociation rates in other cases .",
    "for instance , we have simulated a system in which repression occurs in a cooperative manner . in this system , the repressor backward rate is smaller when two repressors are bound to the operator than when a single repressor is bound .",
    "however , when one of the two repressors dissociates , its rebinding time is so short that the probability for the other repressor to dissociate in the mean time , is negligible for reasonable values of cooperativity . as a result , the effect of spatial fluctuations can be described by a well - stirred model with properly renormalized reaction rates .",
    "we have also studied a system in which the expression of a gene is not under the control of a repressor , but rather under the control of an activator .",
    "also in this system , diffusion of the transcription factors leads to an enhancement of noise in gene expression through a similar mechanism .",
    "do these observations imply that the effect of spatial fluctuations can always be described by a well - stirred model ? in the system studied here , the ligand ( repressor ) molecules bind to a single site .",
    "we expect that the effect of spatial fluctuations becomes more intricate when the number of binding sites for a particular ligand increases  the binding of the ligand to the different sites will then exhibit correlations",
    ". this could be important when the ligand binds to receptors that occur in dense clusters , as in bacterial chemotaxis  @xcite and in the immune response  @xcite .",
    "in gene regulatory networks this effect could also be significant .",
    "recently , we have shown that in _ e. coli _ , pairs of co - regulated genes ",
    "genes that are controlled by a common transcription factor  tend to lie exceedingly close to each other on the genome  @xcite : their promoter regions are often separated by a distance smaller than a few hundred base pairs .",
    "it is conceivable that spatial fluctuations of the transcription factors introduce correlations between the noise in the expression of these pairs of co - regulated genes .",
    "this study also revealed that pairs of genes that regulate each other , often lie close together , again suggesting that the diffusive motion of transcription factors could be important for the functioning of gene regulatory networks  @xcite .    even in the case of a single gene ,",
    "the effect of spatial fluctuations is expected to be more subtle than that reported here . in this study ,",
    "the operator is modeled as a spherical site .",
    "however , as mentioned in section  [ sec : diffusion ] , transcription factors are believed to find their operator site via a combination of free 3d diffusion and 1d sliding along the dna . while on length scales larger than the sliding distance this process is indeed essentially 3d diffusion , on length and time scales smaller than the sliding distance and sliding time , respectively , the dynamics is more complicated .",
    "we expect that sliding could have two important effects .",
    "first , it will increase the _ number _ of rebindings  the probability that in 1d a random walker returns to the origin is one , while in 3d there is a finite probability that it will escape and never return . secondly",
    ", sliding is expected to also increase the _ duration _ of the rebindings , especially when diffusion along the dna is much slower than diffusion in the cytoplasm .",
    "it is thus conceivable that with sliding , the non - exponential relaxation of the operator state , arising from the rebindings , shifts to lower frequencies ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ps1 ] ) , where fluctuations in the operator state are not filtered out . in addition , it is possible that with sliding , rnap and repressor compete for binding to the promoter on similar time scales , which would mean that the effective dissociation rate is no longer simply given by the bare dissociation rate divided by the number of rebindings . indeed , under these conditions , the effect of spatial fluctuations is likely to become non - trivial , and describing it would probably require a spatially resolved model .",
    "we leave this for future work .",
    "finally , we address the question whether spatial fluctuations , and , more in particular , the rebindings , could be studied experimentally .",
    "interestingly , recent biochemical data on the restriction enzyme ecorv suggests that after an initial dissociation , 10 - 100 rebindings occur before the enzyme escapes into the bulk solution  @xcite , in good agreement with the average number of rebindings calculated in section  [ sec : twostep ] .",
    "however , in our gene expression model , the rebinding times are so short that it would seem difficult to probe the repressor rebindings directly in an experiment .",
    "in fact , reaction rates measured biochemically will probably already be corrected for according to eqs .",
    "[ eq : renorm1 ] and  [ eq : renorm2 ] . sliding along the dna , however ,",
    "may extend the rebinding times to accessible experimental time scales .",
    "moreover , recent experiments suggest that the motion of proteins in the nucleoid might be sub - diffusive , which would increase the importance of the rebindings  @xcite .",
    "recently , magnetic tweezer experiments on a mechanically stretched , supercoiled , single dna have made it possible to study the kinetics of the open complex formation and promoter clearance  @xcite . performing these experiments on a promoter that is under the control of a repressor",
    ", seems a promising approach for studying the effect of spatial fluctuations due to the diffusive motion of transcription factors on the dynamics of gene expression .",
