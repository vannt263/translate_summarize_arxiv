    "recent developments in the heavy ion collision experiment are going to enable us to reach phase transitions that the early universe must have undergone , i.e. , the phase transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    "what is known as the qgp phase transition can consist of two distinct phase transitions .",
    "one is the _ color deconfinement transition _ and the other is the _ chiral symmetry restoration _ or the _ chiral phase transition_. the color liberation associated with deconfinement is a phenomenon distinguishable from the chiral phase transition in principle , but it is likely that the mechanism of confinement would be closely related to the chiral dynamics . according to several theoretical studies @xcite , in fact , confinement should be accompanied by the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . in other words ,",
    "the critical temperature relevant to the deconfinement transition ( denoted by @xmath0 ) is inevitably lower than that relevant to the chiral phase transition ( denoted by @xmath1 ) , that is ; @xmath2 , if two phase transitions are to be distinguished .",
    "actually it is difficult to shed light on underlying physics in the relation between two phase transitions .",
    "it is partly because most of the effective models involving the chiral dynamics have shortcomings in describing confinement physics , and partly because the criterion to characterize the deconfinement transition can not go together with the realization of the chiral symmetry .",
    "we can define an order parameter for the deconfinement transition only when there is no dynamical quark in a theory , or quarks are infinitely massive ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in contrast to it , the chiral symmetry is manifested when quarks can be regarded as massless ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus two phase transitions must lie in the opposite limits in regard to the current quark mass .    in the absence of dynamical quarks pure gluonic systems",
    "have the center symmetry and the polyakov loop , @xmath5 , provides a criterion for confinement @xcite .",
    "the expectation value of the polyakov loop traced in the fundamental representation can be related to the free energy @xmath6 with a static fundamental quark placed in a thermal medium , that is ; @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 denotes the trace over the color space and @xmath9 is the inverse temperature .",
    "may be complex , while @xmath10 $ ] is always real .",
    "moreover it is known that @xmath11 without any proper renormalization goes to zero in the continuum limit . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite what is meaningful is the correlation function of the polyakov loops , from which the inter - quark potential can be inferred .",
    "although the polyakov loop might make little sense as it is , however , the properly renormalized polyakov loop can be defined by the correlation function of the polyakov loops with infinite separation .",
    "recently it has been actually demonstrated that the renormalized polyakov loop is well - behaved as an order parameter @xcite .",
    "we will not go into this issue in the present paper since we take an ansatz for the mean field approximation ( the polyakov loop is then chosen as real ) and have an explicit cut - off parameter of the lattice spacing here .",
    "] under the center transformation the traced polyakov loop , @xmath12 , is twisted by an element of the center group ( i.e.the z(@xmath13 ) group for an su(@xmath13 ) gauge theory ) . in the confined phase where @xmath14",
    ", the center symmetry is realized to result in @xmath15 , while the spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry occurs in the deconfined phase where the expectation value of the polyakov loop takes a finite value corresponding to @xmath16 .    for the purpose of looking into the spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry ,",
    "the effective action in terms of the polyakov loop has been pursued by the strong coupling expansion as well as by the perturbative calculation .",
    "indeed , it has been revealed that the center symmetry is spontaneously broken in a perturbative regime at high temperature , which is actually embodied in what is often called the weiss potential @xcite .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , unstable modes can develop to make the expectation value of the polyakov loop diminished @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , we can not reach an appropriate description of the deconfinement transition in any perturbative way because the phase transition is a non - perturbative phenomenon and moreover the perturbative calculation would have no information on the haar measure @xcite . the haar measure in the context of confinement physics",
    "means a sort of the faddeev - popov determinant @xcite , or precisely speaking , the jacobian of the variable transformation from the gauge potential to the polyakov loop . as stressed also in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nature of the group integration contained in the haar measure can be responsible for confinement and , in fact , it is the case in the strong coupling expansion on the lattice .",
    "it has been found that the resultant effective action in the lowest order of the strong coupling expansion leads to a second order phase transition for the su(2 ) gauge theory @xcite and a first order phase transition for the su(@xmath17 ) gauge theories @xcite .",
    "these results in the strong coupling expansion are consistent with the anticipation derived from the analogy to spin systems based on the center symmetry @xcite .",
    "they are in agreement with the results from the lattice simulation as well @xcite .",
    "when massless quarks in the fundamental representation are present in a theory , the center symmetry is broken explicitly and the polyakov loop would no longer serve as an order parameter to identify the deconfinement transition @xcite . then , another symmetry , i.e. , the chiral symmetry plays an important role in hadronic properties .",
    "there are many effective approaches based on the chiral symmetry such as the linear - sigma model , the nambu  jona - lasinio model , the chiral random matrix model and so on @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry with the staggered fermion on the lattice has already been investigated by means of the double expansion of strong coupling and large dimensionality @xcite .",
    "the results are surprisingly acceptable not only qualitatively but quantitatively also .    for a moderate value of the quark mass , neither the deconfinement transition nor the chiral phase transition has any well - defined order parameter .",
    "in the lattice qcd simulation , it has been observed that the polyakov loop and the chiral order parameter show crossover behaviors in the presence of dynamical quarks @xcite , as if the magnetization in spin systems under an external magnetic field . to be interesting , the lattice",
    "qcd results suggest that the simultaneous transitions for deconfinement and chiral restoration take place at the same pseudo - critical temperature , that is ; the respective peaks of the susceptibility for the polyakov loop and for the chiral order parameter are found at the same temperature .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , satz emphasized that such coincidence of the pseudo - critical temperatures can be understood in the following way : at low temperature where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , the explicit breaking of the center symmetry is suppressed by the heavier mass of constituent quarks rather than the lighter mass of current quarks .",
    "consequently the expectation value of the polyakov loop stays small in the confined or chiral broken phase at low temperature .",
    "once the constituent quark mass drops off in the chiral symmetric phase at high temperature , the explicit breaking of the center symmetry is enlarged to result in a finite value of the polyakov loop .",
    "although this qualitative argument is developed further in ref .",
    "@xcite , any quantitative demonstration had not been given until our analysis on the gocksch - ogilvie model @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that , according to satz s argument , the behavior of the polyakov loop would be sensitive to the chiral phase transition rather than the deconfinement transition . in order to disclose the underlying relation between deconfinement and chiral restoration , some legitimate order parameters are indispensable to characterize the deconfinement transition even in the presence of dynamical quarks .",
    "however , defining an order parameter for the deconfinement transition is a quite difficult question because of the thermal excitation of dynamical quarks , particularly under the thermodynamic limit at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it is interesting to consider the system with dynamical quarks in the adjoint representation since adjoint quarks would preserve the center symmetry .",
    "actually the color structure of adjoint quarks is identical to that of gluons .",
    "thus the polyakov loop serves as an appropriate order parameter for the deconfinement transition with respect to _ fundamental _ quarks in a similar way as in the pure gluonic theories .",
    "the chiral phase transition for dynamical adjoint quarks and the deconfinement transition for static fundamental quarks can be defined separately in this case . in the lattice simulation with adjoint quarks ( lattice aqcd ) , it has been found that the critical temperature for the chiral restoration is distinctly higher than that for the deconfinement transition @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply the gocksch - ogilvie model to investigate the system with adjoint quarks as well .",

    "the first term is the gluonic contribution in terms of the polyakov loop .",
    "an order - disorder phase transition described by this gluonic action signifies the transition from the center symmetric confined phase to the symmetry broken deconfined phase . the next term involving @xmath32 is the meson interaction term in the spatial direction resulting from the group integration with respect to the spatial link variables as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : go_model ]  ( a ) .",
    "the last logarithmic term corresponds to the thermal excitation of dynamical quarks as depicted intuitively in fig .",
    "[ fig : go_model ]  ( b ) .",
    "this interpretation will become tangible if once the polyakov loop @xmath22 is set to be unity by hand .",
    "the logarithmic term then takes a familiar form of the free energy for fermionic ideal gases .    in the case of fundamental quarks the center symmetry is explicitly broken by the thermal quark excitation with fractional baryon number .",
    "actually the expansion of the logarithmic quark contribution in the power of the polyakov loop is essentially equivalent to the hopping parameter expansion @xcite and then the power of the polyakov loop counts the winding number of quark paths along the thermal torus , namely , the quark number in the system .",
    "the leading contribution in such an expansion in terms of the polyakov loop is @xmath50 , which can be regarded as the symmetry breaking term under an external magnetic - like field in analogy to spin systems .",
    "the magnitude of the symmetry breaking external field is specified by @xmath51 hence it becomes smaller as the constituent quark mass gets larger .",
    "thus satz s argument on the relation between the polyakov loop behavior and the chiral dynamics is already embodied qualitatively in the gocksch - ogilvie model in a natural way . of course",
    ", the model will give us deeper insight into the interplay between the deconfinement transition and the chiral phase transition beyond qualitative arguments , as we will see in the subsequent sections .",
    "now we shall remark about the applicable range in which the gocksch - ogilvie model can make sense .",
    "the limit of the temperature going to zero would render the model illegitimate because separate treatments for the spatial directions and for the thermal direction as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : go_model ] can be allowed safely only at high temperature . in order to take the limit of zero temperature properly in the gocksch - ogilvie model , the group integration with respect to the polyakov loop , as performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is indispensable , which needs somewhat complicated algebraic procedures .",
    "the interested temperature here is , as we will see later , around @xmath52 which corresponds to @xmath53 in the present analysis .",
    "thus we believe that it is well - founded to deal with the thermal direction separately in the construction of the model .",
    "the opposite limit of the temperature getting extremely high would make the quantitative argument meaningless simply because the strong coupling expansion does not work in a perturbative regime at such high temperature .",
    "the stefan - boltzmann law , for example , can not be derived within the framework of the strong coupling expansion on the lattice . in any case ,",
    "as far as the region around the critical temperature is concerned , we can presume that the gocksch - ogilvie model should be applicable .",

    "an interesting limit is that the mean field for the polyakov loop is forced to be zero by hand , i.e. , @xmath74 .",

    "i.e. , without any external source from the mean field , the expansion of the logarithmic contribution in terms of the polyakov loop gives rise to only center symmetric combinations .",

    "yet they can have different behaviors . in the chiral limit for a clear example , the slope vanishes above the critical temperature @xmath1 , while the susceptibility becomes finite or even larger than the magnitude below @xmath1 .",
    "actually simple mean field arguments typically give twice larger amplitude for the susceptibility above @xmath1 than that below @xmath1 .    the slope and the susceptibility relevant to the polyakov loop , on the other hand , do not have to enhance due to the first order deconfinement transition .",
    "therefore , for parameter  i , we have no reason to expect any coincidence from the beginning because of the deconfinement dominance where the polyakov loop behavior has little information on the second order transition .",
    "the polyakov loop behavior is still smooth even for parameter  ii .",
    "we consider that it is because the simple ansatz of the mean field action ( [ eq : mf_action ] ) would miss the significant part of the coupling to the symmetry breaking contribution through which the coincidence is brought about .",
    "this ansatz can incorporate , at most , a linear term of an external magnetic - like field and thus the non - linearity leading to the fact that the chiral phase transition temperature must be higher than the deconfinement transition temperature would be lost as a result of the approximation .",
    "hence we can not see the coincidence of the peak location even for parameter  ii .",
    "now we would comment upon one interesting possibility : the results from the lattice qcd simulation suggest that the situation of parameter  ii is more realistic , and nevertheless , it would be appealing to consider some modification or artificial tuning in the lattice simulation , by which the case of parameter  i is realized",

    "we have acquired the behavior of the order parameters as functions of the temperature and their slopes by differentiating with respect to the temperature .",
    "then we found the peaks of the slope for the polyakov loop and for the chiral order parameter located at the same pseudo - critical temperature .",
    "physical implication of the coincidence of the pseudo - critical temperatures has proved to be twofold : one is the deconfinement dominance where the remnant of the first oder deconfinement transition would govern the behavior of the order parameters around @xmath125 .",
    "the other is the chiral dominance where the second order chiral phase transition would be responsible for the realization of the simultaneous jump of the order parameters around @xmath125 .",
