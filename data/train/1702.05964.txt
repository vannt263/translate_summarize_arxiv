    "over the years knot theory has worked with knots and links in the three - dimensional sphere @xmath2 .",
    "however , together with improving knowledge about 3-manifolds , great attention has been paid to knots and links in manifolds different from @xmath2 : seifert fiber spaces @xcite ( in particular , lens spaces @xcite ) , thickened surfaces @xcite , arbitrary 3-manifolds @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on knots and links in lens spaces @xmath0 with @xmath1 .",
    "these manifolds are the simplest ones ( beside @xmath2 ) where we can study knots and links since every link in @xmath3 can be presented by integer @xmath4-surgery over the unknot ( in cases of other manifolds the surgery link can be much more difficult ) .",
    "moreover , there are interesting articles explaining applications of knots in lens spaces to other fields of science : @xcite exploits them to describe topological string theories and @xcite uses them to describe the resolution of a biological dna recombination problem .",
    "a lot of link invariants can be generalized from links in @xmath2 to links in @xmath0 .",
    "kauffman bracket skein module @xcite , knot floer homology @xcite , homfly - pt polynomial @xcite all have analogues in lens spaces .",
    "despite the fact that some invariants can be generalized to links in lens spaces , sometimes it is very difficult to use them .",
    "for example , the fundamental quandle of a link which has a very simple topological description for links in @xmath2 can be easily generalized to links in @xmath0 .",
    "however , an explicit procedure to write down a presentation of a fundamental quandle for links in @xmath0 by generators and relations directly from a ( band , disc , grid ) diagram is known only in the case @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) , so it is almost impossible to use this invariant .",
    "another disadvantage of the ordinary fundamental quandle for links in @xmath0 is that the fundamental quandle of the link @xmath6 is isomorphic to the fundamental quandle of its lift @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the universal covering map .",
    "so we can not distinguish links with equivalent liftings .",
    "such invariants are called _ inessential _ @xcite . in this paper",
    "we define the notion of virtual quandle for links in @xmath3 .",
    "virtual quandles were firstly introduced in @xcite as generalizations of quandles for virtual links .",
    "even if in the present paper we do not work with virtual links , we use the name `` virtual quandle '' since our invariant has the same algebraic structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ band ]",
    "we review the definition of band diagrams for links in lens spaces , while in section [ quandle ] we recall those of quandle and virtual quandle , proving some results that will be useful in the following . in section [ s33 ]",
    "we construct a virtual quandle for links in @xmath3 and prove that it is an invariant ( see theorem [ tt2 ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ exex ] we investigate some properties of this invariant , proving that it is essential ( see proposition [ esss ] ) .",
    "in this section we recall the notion of band diagrams for links in lens spaces ( which were firstly introduced in @xcite ) and recall how reidemeister moves for such band diagrams look like .",
    "we start by giving the definition of dehn surgery in @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a knot in @xmath2 , denote by @xmath10 a closed tubular neighborhood of @xmath9 and let @xmath11 be a simple closed curve on @xmath12 . _",
    "the dehn surgery on @xmath9 along @xmath11 _ is the manifold @xmath13 obtained by gluing @xmath14 with a solid torus @xmath15 along their boundaries via a homeomorphism which identifies @xmath11 with the boundary of a meridian disc .",
    "the curve @xmath11 is called the _ slope _ of the surgery and the homeomorphism type of the resulting manifold depends only on the homology class of @xmath11 in @xmath12 , up to orientation change .",
    "we fix a base @xmath16 for @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 is a meridian of @xmath9 and @xmath19 has algebraic intersection 1 with @xmath18 .",
    "if the homology class of @xmath11 is @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , we call the surgery _ rational _ and we say that it has _ framing index _ @xmath22 .",
    "every link @xmath23 in a manifold @xmath13 obtained via a @xmath22-surgery over @xmath9 , can be presented by a diagram of a link @xmath24 in @xmath2 , where the knot @xmath9 is equipped with a number @xmath25 , the surgery along @xmath9 gives @xmath13 and @xmath23 is the image of @xmath26 under the surgery operation .",
    "this presentation of @xmath23 is called _ a mixed link diagram _ and the knot @xmath9 is called the _ surgery knot_.",
    "in order to simplify notation we use the same symbol @xmath23 to denote both @xmath26 and @xmath23 .    the _ lens space _",
    "@xmath0 is the 3-manifold obtained by a rational surgery on the unknot @xmath27 in @xmath2 with framing index @xmath28 .",
    "so , a link @xmath23 in @xmath0 can be described by a mixed link diagram of the link @xmath29 ( see , for example , figure [ mixxx ] ) .    in order to construct a band diagram for a link @xmath23 in @xmath0 we present @xmath2 as a one - point compactification of @xmath30 and fix coordinates @xmath31 in @xmath30 such that the surgery knot ( which is the unknot in @xmath2 ) is described as the @xmath32 axis in @xmath30 .",
    "a regular orthogonal projection of a mixed link diagram onto the plane @xmath33 is called _ a punctured disc diagram _ of @xmath23 ( see figure [ punban ] on the left ) . in a punctured disc diagram",
    "the surgery knot is depicted as a puncture . a _ band diagram _ for a link @xmath23 in @xmath0",
    "can be obtained from a punctured disk diagram by ( i ) cutting a disc containing the punctured disk diagram and centered in the pucture along a half - line starting from the puncture and avoiding the crossings of @xmath23 and ( ii ) deforming the resulting annulus into a rectangle ( see figure [ punban ] on the right ) .",
    "clearly , an orientation of the link induces an orientation on the resulting band diagram .",
    "[ punban ]    the intersection points of the link with the left ( resp .",
    "right ) side of the band diagram are called _ left ( resp .",
    "right ) boundary points_. left and right boundary points together are called _ boundary points _ of a band diagram .",
    "two band diagrams are equivalent under the three classical reidemeister moves @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 inside the rectangle and a global move called _ the @xmath37-move _ ( see @xcite ) . in the case of lens spaces @xmath3 the @xmath37-move is depicted in figure [ sl ] .",
