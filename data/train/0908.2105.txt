    "there is currently interest in using single electron spins in quantum dots ( qds ) for quantum information processing ( qip ) applications@xcite . in @xmath5 semiconductor quantum dots , such as @xmath6 , spins of conduction band electrons couple",
    "to nuclear spins of the host material and suffer decoherence due to hyperfine interactions .",
    "however , valence hole states are built from atomic @xmath7-type orbitals , which are expected to minimize the hyperfine interaction between the hole and surrounding nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "the spin of a valence hole as a qubit is expected to have longer coherence time . a theory of heavy holes as qubits has been developed in the single band approximation@xcite .",
    "the justification for the use of the heavy hole single band approximation is that strain and qd confinement suppress the coupling between heavy hole ( hh ) and light hole ( lh ) bands .",
    "under such an assumption , the qubit levels are defined by the @xmath8 and @xmath9 hh states .",
    "in such a simple model , the exchange coupling @xmath10 needed to generate entanglement between spins of two holes is proportional to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the tunneling strength of the hole and @xmath13 is the on - site coulomb energy .",
    "however , recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite work show that in two vertically coupled disk - like qds the spin orbit ( so ) coupling between hh and lh bands changes the sign of the effective tunneling matrix element @xmath12 as a function of inter - dot distance .",
    "if the inter - dot distance is smaller than a critical value , the hole state is mainly symmetric .",
    "however , if the inter - dot distance passes the critical value , the hole state is mainly antisymmetric .",
    "these results suggest that a description of an array of hole - based qubits requires taking into account the hole tunneling between dots with so coupling between hh and lh bands .",
    "the theory of valence holes in quantum dots with strong so coupling has been developed already @xcite .",
    "in this theory hole spin is strongly coupled to orbital motion and valence hole states are treated as luttinger spinors .",
    "the two hh ground states are replaced by two luttinger spinors @xcite with different chiralities .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a theory of qubits based on the chirality of the valence hole - based luttinger spinors .",
    "we are particularly interested in square - like self - assembled quantum dots grown on nanotemplates @xcite , which due to scalable architecture may lead to quantum information processing devices .",
    "we start with a single hole confined in an isolated qd .",
    "we explicitly define the qubit as two chirality states of luttinger spinor and show how to perform single qubit operations .",
    "our theory reproduces results obtained earlier by kyrychenko and kossut @xcite .",
    "next , we investigate the tunneling of a valence hole in two orientations of two coupled square qds as illustrated in fig [ fig : schem ] . the tunneling barriers for",
    "vertically coupled quantum dots ( vcqds ) and laterally coupled quantum dots ( lcqds ) are modelled as finite potential wells , as shown in fig [ fig : schem ] .",
    "the tunnel barrier strength is characterized by the band - offset between the dot and the barrier material . for vcqds",
    ", we verify the results @xcite obtained for disk quantum dots showing the reversal of ground state character from symmetric to antisymmetric as a function of inter - dot distance .",
    "close to the reversal , the vanishing of tunneling of a luttinger spinor hole in vcqds allows the benefit of strong confinement defined by growth with the possibility to control tunneling and hence double qubit operations using additional metallic gates .",
    "following ref . , we expand the wavefunction of a valence hole confined to a nanostructure defined by confining potential @xmath14 in terms of @xmath15 bloch basis functions . the 4-band luttinger kohn ( lk ) hamiltonian @xcite reads , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the identity matrix ,",

    "the lk hamiltonian in eq.([eq : lkmatrix ] ) exhibits several symmetries that we use to characterize the luttinger spinors ( the eigenstates of the lk hamiltonian ) .",
    "the confining potential along the @xmath1 direction is symmetric with respect to the origin defined in the middle of the structure ; yet , due to spin - orbit coupling between different bands , our system does not have definite parity symmetry along the @xmath1 direction but the time reversal symmetry of the system demands the two hh bands have opposite parity .",
    "the same also holds for lh bands .",
    "this allows us to define the chirality operator @xcite which reads , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the inversion operator with respect to the @xmath1 variable .",
    "the @xmath35 operator has 2 eigenvalues , which we denote by @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . in the case of @xmath38 ,",
    "the luttinger spinors have even parity with respect to @xmath1 for the first two components of the spinor and odd parity with respect to @xmath1 for the last two components of the spinor .",
    "in the case of @xmath39 , the parity pattern is reversed between the first two and last two components of the spinor .",
    "furthermore , square qds also have parity symmetry in the @xmath40 plane , and we may define another parity operator @xmath41 analogous to the @xmath35 by replacing @xmath34 with @xmath42 on the diagonal terms in eq.([eq : chirality ] ) where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are inversion operators along the @xmath3 and the @xmath45 direction respectively .",
    "arguments for the @xmath35 operator also apply to the @xmath41 operator .",
    "the only difference is that the @xmath46 operator in eq.([eq : lkoperators ] ) involves @xmath47 term which prevents further separation of @xmath3 and @xmath45 variables .",
    "again , @xmath41 has 2 eigenvalues denoted by @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for @xmath50",
    ", the first two components of the spinor must have the same parity with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath45 , and the last two components of the spinor must have opposite parity with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath45 .",
    "for @xmath49 , the luttinger spinors again have the parity pattern switched between the first two and last two components .",
    "the 4-band valence hole spinors in a square qd have well defined structures .",
    "the bloch function part of the luttinger spinors is determined by the lattice symmetries ; while the envelope function part of luttinger spinors is obtained from eq.([eq : lkmatrix ] ) . in our analysis , we expand the envelope function of the luttinger spinors in eigenstates of the 3d infinite potential well of the size of our computational box . as mentioned , the chirality and the @xmath40 parity symmetries allow us to label luttinger spinors by @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , which index the @xmath54 eigenstate of subspace @xmath55 and @xmath52 .",
    "for instance , the @xmath54 state of the subspace @xmath56 and @xmath50 reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 are positive integers .",
    "@xmath59 represents the coefficient for the envelope function of a specific component @xmath60 of luttinger spinors . in our study",
    ", we assume that the confinement along the @xmath1 direction is strong , so we only need to consider the first 2 eigenfunctions of the 1d infinite potential well in this direction .",

    "the luttinger spinors in other subspaces have distinguishable parity patterns derived from eq.([eq : spinor ] ) by switching either the parity pattern with respect to the @xmath40 variable or the @xmath1 variable between first two and last two components of the spinor .    from here",
    "onwards , the luttinger spinor is written with the components corresponding to the bloch functions in the order @xmath68 as done in eq.([eq : spinor ] ) , and we will no longer explicitly write out the bloch functions @xmath60 as we have done above .",
    "in this analysis , we take the entire luttinger spinor as a representation of valence hole state confined in the quantum dots as opposed to adopting the hh single band approximation @xcite . due to the time reversal symmetry , we have a doubly degenerate ground state with distinct chirality at zero field .",
    "we encode the qubit with the chirality , @xmath51 , of the ground state luttinger spinors .",
    "we show that static magnetic fields applied along the @xmath1 and the @xmath3 direction indeed act as @xmath4 and @xmath2 operators respectively in the qubit subspace .",
    "this result assures all the basic ingredients needed to perform arbitrary single qubit rotations .      by diagonalizing the lk hamiltonian for a square qd , we find that the 2 ground states are characterized by quantum numbers @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "let us denote the state with @xmath72 by @xmath73 , and the other state with @xmath74 by @xmath75 .",

    ", @xmath80 will have the same set of envelope functions in eq.([eq : state1insqd ] ) but complex conjugated and in a reversed order in the spinor .",
    "due to the strong confinement along the @xmath1 direction , the ground states of the system will contain a dominant contribution from the hh states .",
    "therefore , the states @xmath75 and @xmath73 correspond to either a @xmath81 hh or @xmath82 hh occupying the @xmath83 orbital of a 3d infinite potential box .",
    "to analyze the system in the presence of external fields @xmath84 , we use the gauge @xmath85 .",
    "first , we consider the system under an external field @xmath69 .",
    "fig [ fig : bfields]a shows the energy spectrum of a single square dot charged with one valence hole as a function of @xmath69 .",
    "we see that the qubit subspace , the 2 lowest energy levels , are well isolated from the rest of the energy spectrum across a wide range of applied field . due to the weak coupling between the qubit subspace and other excited states , we may treat the effects of @xmath69 fields by the first order lwdin perturbation theory@xcite , which is simply a projection of the full lk hamiltonian into the qubit subspace .",
    "the entire lk hamiltonian is decomposed into 2 parts : unperturbed hamiltonian at the zero field and additional perturbing hamiltonian due to the field .",

    "the matrix elements @xmath107 do not suggest coupling of + 3/2 hh and -3/2 hh .",
    "rather , it actually represents the coupling of a chirality up ( @xmath38 ) + 3/2 hh with a chirality down ( @xmath39 ) + 3/2 hh .",
    "due to time reversal symmetry , the chirality down + 3/2 hh must have the same envelope function as the chirality up -3/2 hh .",
    "similar argument applies to all other matrix elements in eq.([eq : hbx ] ) .",
    "we further remark that the off - diagonal matrix element contains pairs of complex conjugates ; thus , the matrix element is real - valued .",
    "the mixing of the qubit states is due to the simultaneous breaking of the parity symmetry in the @xmath40 plane and the inversion symmetry along the @xmath1 direction ; for instance , we refer to the term @xmath108 in both @xmath109 and @xmath110 operators in eq.([eq : lkoperatorssx ] ) as responsible for the breaking of symmetries .",
    "the fact that we may couple the qubit states by static fields is in contradiction to analysis done in the hh single band approximation @xcite . in hh single band approximation ,",
    "the single qubit operation can not be done by electron spin resonance ( esr ) techniques because the magnetic field can not couple two hh states ( in the leading dipole approximation ) .",
    "more sophisticated techniques such as electric dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) are needed . however ,",
    "in our proposal , we define qubit states with the entire luttinger spinor , which is an admixture of all hhs and lhs , and the mixing of the two qubit states is due to the coupling between the two luttinger spinors as manifested in eq.([eq : hbx ] ) .    the @xmath2 operator for our proposed luttinger spinor based qubit is essentially driven by the zeeman energy ; whereas the @xmath4 operator is based on the mixing of valence hole components by vector potential @xmath111 and so coupling . due to the different mechanisms of",
    "how the 2 qubit states are operated on by @xmath69 and @xmath97 field , the effective g factor ( for a simple spin in an external field ) seems to have much stronger transverse component@xcite , @xmath112 .",
    "hence it takes more time to perform a spin flip process with the luttinger spinor based qubit .",
    "we will characterize the single qubit operating time with the @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the energy difference between ground and first excited state under @xmath97 field . from fig",
    "[ fig : bfields]b , we see the characteristic time is around 1.5 ns when @xmath115 .",
    "however , modulating the strain of the host material can relax the qd confinement along the @xmath1 direction , induce a stronger planar component of the g factors and improve the single qubit operating time .",
    "finally , we remark that the luttinger spinor based qubits are susceptible to the same channels of decoherence that are already discussed for valence hole confined in qds in refs .  .",
    "however , electric field fluctuation in the background of the host material will not affect the luttinger spinor based qubits . as the electric field induced dipole transitions , @xmath116 , conserve the time reversal symmetry , the two qubit states , which are kramers doublets , will not be mixed .",
    "we now turn to the analysis of double qubit operations with the luttinger spinors based qubits .",
    "our proposal for double qubit operations with the valence holes - based qubits relies on the following assumptions .",
    "first , we consider 2 valence holes localized in two different qds in the weak tunneling limit and only the on - site coulomb interaction is taken into account .",
    "second , we consider that each qd only contains the two relevant qubit states . under these assumptions ,",
    "the hole - hole interacting hamiltonian in second quantization reads @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath7 are indices for qd number 1 and 2 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 is the energy of valence hole state @xmath120 on the @xmath121 dot , t is the tunneling parameter between qds , and @xmath122 is the on - site coulomb interaction , with the matrix elements given in the appendix .",
    "this hamiltonian can be greatly simplified because the coulomb interaction conserves the chirality of 2 holes in the following manner : ( a ) if @xmath123 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 , ( b ) if @xmath126 and @xmath127 , @xmath128 , ( c ) if just one of the valence holes switches chirality , u = 0 .",
    "taking also into account that we only consider 2 states of distinct chirality on each qd , the on - site coulomb interactions term in eq.([eq:2holeh ] ) reduces to @xcite @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the number operator , and @xmath131 represents the 2 chirality states on a qd .",
    "different from electron spins , the on - site coulomb interaction between valence holes is composed of a direct coulomb term @xmath132 and an exchange term @xmath133 which enhance the overall interaction .",
    "however , apart from this difference , once we have parameterized the tunneling parameter t and u , we have the hubbard hamiltonian . in the strong coulomb regime ,",
    "the interaction between 2 localized particles in the hubbard model can be reduced to two spins with the heisenberg exchange constants @xmath10 proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "an interesting phenomenon@xcite associated with valence holes is the possibility of engineering @xmath12 to be either positive , zero or negative in a stack of vertically coupled cylindrical qds by simply tuning the inter - dot distance .",
    "as the exchange coupling between 2 qubits is directly proportional to @xmath134 , this implies qubit - qubit interactions can be turned on and off as needed .",
    "we would like to investigate whether the similar phenomenon will happen with square qds stacked either in a vertical or lateral structure .    to estimate the magnitude of @xmath12",
    ", we rely on a tight - binding picture in which a valence hole tunnels between the two dots and the hybridization of local orbitals gives a symmetric state , @xmath135 with energy @xmath136 and an antisymmetric state , @xmath137 with energy @xmath138 .",
    "thus , the energy gap between first excited state and ground state is @xmath139 .",
    "so we compute the energy spectrum of a single valence hole in a double qds by exact diagonalizing eq.([eq : lkmatrix ] ) , then we extract the value of @xmath12 from the calculated energy gap .",
    "the potential @xmath14 of vcqds is modeled with an infinite potential well along the @xmath3 and the @xmath45 direction and double well potential profile along the @xmath1 direction . in the barrier region between the dots",
    ", we set a constant finite potential of 320 @xmath140 corresponding to the band offset between ingaas and gaas , same as reported in ref . ,",
    "so we may draw a comparison between square - like and disk - like dots .",
    "as shown in fig [ fig : cqds]a , the lowest energy levels of different chirality subspaces cross at a certain inter - dot distance",
    ". the insets of fig [ fig : cqds]a present the most dominant hh wavefunction profile along the @xmath1 direction of the ground state before and after the crossing point .",
    "the wavefunction plots show the reversal of symmetry for the ground state of the system .",
    "similar phenomenon occurs in both square and disk dots .",
    "these results confirm that the effects of hh and lh mixing is insensitive to the confining potential in the @xmath40 plane .",
    "these results also imply that we can shut down any undesirable hole - hole interaction between holes localized in different dots if the inter - dot distance is chosen at the point where the crossing occurs in fig [ fig : cqds]a .",
    "the potential of lcqds is modeled similar to that of vcqds except that the double well potential profile lies along the @xmath45 direction .",
    "our result , fig [ fig : cqds]b , shows no crossing of lowest energy states from distinct chirality subspaces .",
    "we understand that the confinement strength along the @xmath1 direction plays a crucial role in determining how much hh and lh bands mixing a system will experience , because qds are quasi - two dimensional devices with a much smaller dimension along the @xmath1 direction . in the case of vcqds ,",
    "the coupled dots relax significantly the confinement strength of the hole states along the @xmath1 direction and bring the lh and hh energies closer .",
    "however , a lcqds structure relaxes confinement strength in the @xmath40 plane which does not facilitate the mixing of hh and lh states .",
    "hence no reversal of the ground state as a function of the distance is observed .",
    "in summary , we consider the luttinger spinor description of confined valence hole states in qds .",
    "we identify the two qubit levels with two chiralities of the lowest energy kramers doublet and suggest that @xmath69 and @xmath97 fields act analogously to the @xmath35 and @xmath141 operators . for arrays of hole qubits we study",
    "tunneling of holes in vertical and lateral architecture as dominant mechanism for the qubit exchange interaction .",
    "we show that tunneling can be arrested for vertical pairs of quantum dots but not for lateral architecture . the capability to switch the sign of the effective tunneling @xmath12 in vcqds",
    "is demonstrated .",
