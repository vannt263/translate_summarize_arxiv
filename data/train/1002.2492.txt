    "massive young star clusters occasionally harbor a number of red supergiants with an initial mass of @xmath3@xmath4 @xcite , which are destined for a supernova explosion leaving behind a neutron star as a final product @xcite .",
    "since red supergiants exhibit high luminosity , they are easily identified at infrared wavelengths even if large interstellar extinction is assumed .",
    "they can be used as an indicator of age and mass of star clusters embedded in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "a red supergiant with @xmath5 has a progenitor mass of about @xmath6 @xcite , which is likely the upper limit of the initial masses of red supergiants in star clusters .",
    "@xcite measured the equivalent widths of the co first overtone bands , and identified 14 m supergiants in a cluster in scutum [ # 122 of @xcite = rsgc1 ] .",
    "they inferred the initial mass of this cluster to be @xmath7@xmath8 and the age between 7 and 12 myr , based on the color - luminosity diagram assuming the salpeter s initial mass function .",
    "@xcite detected sio masers from 4 of these red supergiants .",
    "they found that the velocity dispersion of the maser sources is equivalent to that of a cluster with a mass of @xmath9 , and that the average radial velocity of maser sources indicates a kinematic distance of 6.5 kpc to the cluster .",
    "this example demonstrated that sio masers are a useful tool for studying kinematics of star clusters as well as mass - losing process of massive stars at the final stage of stellar evolution .    in this paper , we present the results of sio and h@xmath0o maser searches for red supergiants in # 2 of @xcite , and candidates for red supergiants in the other star clusters in the @xcite s catalog .",
    "the former cluster contains more than 10 red supergiants @xcite .",
    "a later near - infrared ( nir ) study found more supergiants and early type stars in the stephenson # 2 cluster @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite spectroscopically identified 15 red supergiants in the stephenson # 2 cluster and nearby aggregation 5@xmath10 south - west from the stephenson # 2 cluster .",
    "@xcite cataloged about 200 infrared star clusters lying in the galactic disk using the spitzer / glimpse survey .",
    "some of them include nearby bright middle - infrared ( mir ) sources , which are likely red supergiants showing a typical color of sio maser sources .",
    "however , since the color ranges of evolved stars in the nir and mir bands are somewhat overlapped with those of young stellar objects , it is not easy to discriminate young stars from evolved stars solely by the infrared colors .",
    "detections of sio masers are crucial for confirming the supergiant status of candidate stars in embedded clusters .",
    "we selected three star clusters ( # 4 , # 8 and # 13 ) as observing targets from @xcite s catalog : each selected clusters includes multiple candidates for red supergiants .",
    "the cluster # 13 of @xcite , which is located about 6@xmath11 north of stephenson # 2 , is interesting because of an associated bright ir object ( 144 jy at 12 @xmath12 m ) .",
    "we have also mapped co emission of stephenson # 2 and several other clusters selected from the mercer et al.s catalog .",
    "in addition , we mapped co emission toward the prototypical red - supergiant star cluster in scutum ( rsgc1 ) for comparison .",
    "massive star clusters are formed in giant molecular clouds @xcite , but the gas components of the clusters are eventually expelled and dissociated by radiation of massive stars while the stars are at the main sequence of stellar evolution , and at the later phase by supernova explosion @xcite . dynamical evolution and dissolution of star clusters depend strongly on gas expulsion process ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to know how much amount of co gas does remain in the star clusters with red supergiants .",

    "though st2 - 26 is a faint object with @xmath24 jy , we detected sio maser emission .",
    "the broad line profile of st2 - 18 suggests that this is a typical red supergiant [ for example , @xcite ] .",
    "the radial velocity of st2 - 17 is shifted by more than 40 km s@xmath1 from the velocities of the other stars .",
    "therefore , we conclude that st2 - 17 is not a member of stephenson # 2 .",
    "we infer from this fact that some stars at the northern part of stephenson # 2 ( i.e , st2 - 15 , st2 - 21 , st2 - 23 , st2 - 27 , and st2 - 29 ) , which are located far from the cluster center , are not physically associated with stephenson # 2 .    what is interesting is whether stephenson # 2 sw is physically associated with the stephenson # 2 .",

    "the average radial velocity and velocity dispersion for the sio sources in stephenson # 2 sw are 94.5 km s@xmath1 and 3.5 km s@xmath1 , respectively , which is shifted from the velocity of st2 - 3 in the stephenson # 2 by 7.7 km s@xmath1 .",

    "water masers were detected at several locations .",
    "the radial velocity of mc4 - 02 determined from the present sio observation is close to that of the co component of m17 at @xmath2723 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in fact , a strong co emission is seen in the north - west parts of the channel maps in the range between @xmath27 and 23 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the h@xmath0o maser emission was detected toward three objects mc4 - 01 , mc4 - 03 and mc4 - 08 .",
    "because of the large beam size at 22 ghz , h@xmath0o emission of nearby objects could be detected at the tail of a gaussian beam .",
    "the velocity of h@xmath0o emission toward mc4 - 03 is 20.5 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this is close to the velocity 19.4 km s@xmath1 of the secondary ( redshifted ) component of h@xmath0o emission of mc4 - 08 .",
    "the angular separation between these two objects is 143@xmath16 , indicating that the intensity should be reduced to 0.1% level if the 19.4 km s@xmath1 emission from mc4 - 08 is detected at the gaussian tail of the beam pattern at the position of mc4 - 03 .",
    "the observed ratio of the integrated intensity of mc4 - 03 to that of mc4 - 08 is 29% , which is too large for a side - lobe detection , indicating that the 20.5 km s@xmath1 emission of mc4 - 03 is not a contamination from mc4 - 08 ( though we can not rule out the possibility that the emission comes from an unknown h@xmath0o source located near the middle between mc4 - 03 and mc4 - 08 ) .",
    "two water maser sources ( possibly of a young star origin ) have been detected in m17 north @xcite : g15.18@xmath220.62 ( + 21 km s@xmath1 ) , and g15.20@xmath220.63 ( + 47 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "they are located at 20@xmath16 and 92@xmath16 away from mc4 - 01 ( @xmath28 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore , g15.18@xmath220.62 could be the same h@xmath0o maser source as mc4 - 01 , but g15.20@xmath220.63 is different from mc4 - 01 .",
    "the difference of 3 km s@xmath1 between peak velocities of mc4 - 01 and g15.18@xmath220.62 could be explained by a time variation of a line profile .",
    "thus , we conclude that two of the three h@xmath0o maser sources detected in the present observation are new .      in mc8 - 01 ,",
    "sio maser emission is detected at @xmath29 km s@xmath1 , which is considerably different from the average velocity of mc8 - 03 and mc8 - 04 ( 105.5 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore it is possible that the object mc8 - 01 is a foreground source .",
    "since no water maser was detected toward this star cluster ( table 3 ) , dense molecular gas of a young star origin ( as seen toward mercer et al.s # 4 ) does not remain inside this star cluster . in fact , co channel maps shown in figure 5d indicate that co emission is quite weak toward this cluster , except the 106 km s@xmath1 component , which is extended to the north - east of the star cluster toward mc8 - 05 .",
    "a pulsar , psr j1828@xmath221057 , exists @xmath30 south - east of mc8 - 0 , and three x - ray sources ( xgps - i j182844@xmath22105428 and xgps - i j182851@xmath22105539 , gpsr5 20.722 - 0.075 ) exist in this direction .",
    "the presence of these high - energy sources seems consistent with the interpretation that co gas was wiped out by supernova explosions .",
    "mc13 - 5 in this star cluster is a bright ir source ( @xmath31 jy ) , but a search for sio maser in this object was negative in a previous observation @xcite .",
    "we detected the sio masers for the first time in this object .",
    "water maser was detected toward mc13 - 1 , mc13 - 3 , mc13 - 4 , and mc13 - 5 .",
    "however , since the angular separation between mc13 - 3 and mc13 - 5 is only 41@xmath16 , the h@xmath0o emission at 70.2 km s@xmath1 detected at the position of mc13 - 3 comes from mc13 - 5 .",
    "similarly , the angular separation between mc13 - 4 and mc13 - 5 is 46@xmath16 , the emission at the position of mc13 - 4 is also a contamination from mc13 - 05 .",
    "the emission at 21.4 km s@xmath1 detected toward mc13 - 4 is stronger than that detected at the position of mc13 - 05 . therefore , we conclude that the emission at 21.4 km s@xmath1 is associated with mc13 - 04 .",
    "a compact co emission at @xmath32 km s@xmath1 was found at the position between mc13 - 5 and mc13 - 6 ( see figure 5e ) , indicating that the molecular gas still remains in this cluster .",
    "in addition to the star clusters mentioned above , we observed co emission toward @xcite s # 122 ( = rsgc1 in @xcite ) , which involves 14 red supergiants @xcite .",
    "sio masers have been detected in four of them @xcite ; the average radial velocity and velocity dispersion are 120 km s@xmath1 and 3 km s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the lower right panel of figure 4 shows the co @xmath20 spectra of bica et al.s # 122 taken at 5 different positions aligning in the north  south direction ( centered toward the star f13 ; @xcite ) .",
    "co emission was seen in the velocity range between 85 and 110 km s@xmath1 .",
    "however , no co emission stronger than @xmath33 k was detected at velocities above 110 km s@xmath1 toward this cluster in this work .",
    "this fact suggests that almost no molecular gas remains in this cluster .",
    "we observed 36 candidates for red supergiants in 4 star clusters in the sio and h@xmath0o maser lines , and obtained accurate radial velocities .",
    "the membership of stars to each cluster was confirmed by the velocity information obtained in the present observation , since velocities of contaminated background stars are generally different from that of member stars . with the velocity information obtained by the present maser observations , we can assess whether or not the co emission is associated with the star cluster in terms of radial velocities .",
    "the age and distance of the cluster stephenson # 2 were somewhat uncertain .",
    "@xcite estimated the age and distance to be 50 myr and 1.5 kpc , respectively , from a magnitude - color diagram .",
    "however , @xcite suggested the age of 20 myr and a distance of 6 kpc for this cluster , based on the @xmath34-band photometry and model calculations .",
    "the average radial velocity obtained in the present observation is 96.5 km s@xmath1 , giving a kinematic distance of 5.5 kpc .",
    "this distance is consistent with the estimation given by @xcite .",
    "here we assumed a flat rotation curve with a constant velocity of 220 km s@xmath1 and a distance to the galactic center of 8 kpc .",
    "the standard deviation of radial velocities is 4.4 km s@xmath1 ( for 4 stars ) . to obtain this value , we assumed the uncertainty of 2 km s@xmath1 in the velocity measurement of the sio maser observation [ see , section 3.2 in @xcite ] .",
    "the velocity dispersion gives a virial mass of the cluster ( @xmath35 ; @xcite ) of @xmath36 under the assumption that the radius of the cluster ( including both stephenson # 2 and stephenson # 2 sw ) is 3.1@xmath10 ( @xmath37 pc ) .",
    "the obtained virial mass is larger than the mass of the bica et al.s # 122 ( 24@xmath38 ; @xcite ) .",

    "this value is close to the mass of bica et al.s # 122 , and seems to be reasonable for a single massive cluster .",
    "@xcite obtained the k - band spectra of about 70 stars in stephenson # 2 and stephenson # 2 sw with kitt peak national observatory 4 m telescope .",
    "they measured equivalent widths of the co band - head features and obtained the radial velocities by cross - correlating the band head features with that of arcturus .",
    "we compared the radial velocities obtained in the present radio observation with the velocities obtained by above infrared observations [ see figure 4 of @xcite ] .",
    "the radio and infrared radial velocities of st2 - 18 [ no 1 of @xcite ] coincide within about 2 km s@xmath1 , but other three stars do not show a good match in velocity , and the difference is roughly 810 km s@xmath1 . on average ,",
    "the radial velocities obtained from the co band head are systematically redshifted by about 10 km s@xmath1 .",
    "it has been known that the radial velocities obtained from infrared line profiles are systematically shifted from the true velocity of a star because of the scattering by dust grains in outflowing circumstellar envelopes @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we take into account the uncertainty in the radial velocity obtained by the infrared observation , we can say that the velocities obtained in the present observation is consistent with those given by davies et al .",

    "<S> in addition , mapping observations in the co @xmath20 line toward these clusters revealed that an appreciable amount of molecular gas still remains around stephenson s # 2 cluster in contrast to the prototypical red - supergiant cluster , bica et al.s # 122 . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that a time scale of gas expulsion differs considerably in individual clusters . </S>"
