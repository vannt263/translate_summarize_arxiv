    "major depressive disorder ( mdd ) is unfortunately not that uncommon : around 350 million people around the globe suffer from mdd @xcite . when recovered from mdd , people have a 50% risk of relapsing @xcite . with so many suffering from mdd",
    "comes an even larger amount of costs of treatment , societal costs , and intangible costs like stereotyping .",
    "while many studies have been conducted in the treatment of mdd , it is known that prevention is better than curing , and it is therefore essential that we gain more insight into the development and onset of mdd . in this paper , we demonstrate a new method with which we can assess the risk that individuals may have in developing mdd .    psychological disorders like mdd can be seen as a _",
    "complex dynamical system _ : symptoms of mdd , like loss of energy of feelings of worthlessness , can be seen as nodes in a network that interact , and thereby influence , itself and other symptoms of mdd @xcite .",
    "this _ system _ of interacting symptoms may change over time , making the system _ dynamic _ @xcite : the influence of sleep deprivation on feelings of worthlessness may grow over time , as an individual is feeling more and more depressed .",
    "we can measure these changes by means of the _ experience sampling method _ ( esm ) @xcite , where individual daily life experiences can be measured several times a day for an extended period of time @xcite .",
    "see telford et al . and aan het rot et al . for more information on esm . in the development of mdd",
    ", the system surpasses a critical point @xcite , and a discontinuous transition is made ; a transition from a stable , healthy phase to a stable , depressed phase .",
    "these sudden jumps , called _ phase transitions _ or critical transitions @xcite , are central to complex dynamical systems , and are subject of the risk assessment that we will undertake in the present paper .",
    "while phase transitions occur suddenly , complex dynamical systems leave ` breadcrumbs ' behind that hint towards a phase transition .",
    "these breadcrumbs are called _ early - warning signals _ and occur before the phase transition , and after _ critical slowing down _ @xcite .",
    "every individual has a so - called average mood state : when you have a bad day , you may feel worse than average , but your mood will always return to that average mood state . when you are developing mdd , you are slowly deviating from your personal average mood state . as you are getting closer and closer to the tipping point",
    "at which a phase transition occurs , it will become harder and harder to return to that average mood state .",
    "in other words , your dynamic system of mdd  slows down  so that it is more difficult to return to the average mood state .",
    "recently , it has been shown that critical slowing down actually occurs , prior to the phase transition @xcite .    instead of looking at early - warning signals ,",
    "we believe that symptom activation patterns hold much information about the behaviour of a psychopathological system , and that these patterns may also tell us when the system is at risk for a phase transition . in the current paper",
    ", we aim to show how the risk for experiencing a phase transition can be assessed at the level of the individual . by looking at the proportion of ` active ' symptoms at individual measurements , and by assuming that symptoms behave in the same way to a certain extent",
    ", we can investigate the dynamic behaviour of the system using a _",
    "mean field approximation_. by showing three empirical examples , we demonstrate how our method works on different types of time - series data .",
    "this paper is set up as follows : first , we explain the mean field approximation and the proposed method",
    ". then we present a validation study to show how well the proposed method works .",
    "lastly , we apply the proposed method on three different types of time - series data to show how the proposed method works in practice .",
    "at ( 0,0 ) ; ( 2.1,1.45 ) circle ( 0.15 ) ; ( 2.1,1.45 )  ( 3,1.45 ) ;    a cellular automaton ( ca ) is a dynamical system where nodes are arranged in a fixed and finite grid , and where connected nodes determine the state of a node at each subsequent time point @xcite .",
    "a grid is a graph @xmath0 with @xmath1 nodes in the set @xmath2 where each node @xmath3 is connected to nodes in the neighbourhood @xmath4 . to ensure all nodes have exactly the same number of neighbours",
    ", we invoke the boundary condition such that a node at the boundary is connected to a node on the opposite end , making it a torus .",
    "an example of such a grid is shown in figure [ fig : torus ] , where the middle node is directly connected to four other nodes ( a node s neighbourhood ) , marked in grey @xcite .",
    "we consider elementary cas where each node can be in either of two states : ` active ' ( coded by 1 ) or ` inactive ' ( coded by 0 ) . in",
    "a ca a deterministic , local update rule @xmath5 determines the state of each node based on which nodes are active in the neighbourhood of @xmath3 .",
    "an example of this is the majority rule , where each node becomes 1 whenever more than half of the neighbours of @xmath3 are active , and 0 otherwise .",
    "although many other update rules are possible , we will focus on this particular rule in the present paper .",
    "repeated application of the update rule @xmath5 results in a vector of 0s and 1s called an orbit : at any time point @xmath6 the orbit @xmath7 , such that the same local rule is applied @xmath6 times .    in a probabilistic cellular automaton ( pca ) , a probability is introduced to model uncertainty , based on the number of active neighbours . in our application to psychopathology , this uncertainty is required because we can not predict the behaviour of the symptoms in our network exactly , and because we know that exogenous events influence these symptoms which we can not measure .",
    "the probability @xmath8 determines whether or not a node becomes active at time point @xmath9 .",
    "the majority rule with the probabilistic update used in this paper is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the size of the neighbourhood and @xmath12 the number of active neighbours . because @xmath13 is dependent on the behaviour of the majority of a node s neighbourhood , this update rule",
    "is also called the _ majority rule_. in this pca",
    "each node @xmath14 is then updated according to the majority rule ; all nodes are updated simultaneously ( synchronous updating ) .",
    "the result for each node is a sequence of 0s and 1s .",
    "for all @xmath15 nodes we have the orbits @xmath16 , which are vectors of length @xmath17 for the total duration .",
    "we average all nodes at each time point @xmath6 , @xmath18 , which we call the _ density_. in sum , in a pca nodes can switch between being active or inactive ; these switches are determined by means of a probability that in turn depends on a node s active neighbourhood .",
    "the pca described above is a dynamical system with many components ( nodes ) that switch between active and inactive states . to infer from such a large - scale system some characteristics of what the system will do in the long run",
    "can be rather difficult @xcite . here",
    "we use the uniformity property of the graphs that allow us to reduce the @xmath1-dimensional system to a one - dimensional system . in the grid",
    "it is easily seen that each node is similar to any other node since each node has the same number of neighbours , and becomes active or inactive in the same way by means the majority rule that is based on the number of active neighbours .",
    "this allows us to simplify a pca to a single discrete time dynamical system , as in kozma et al . and balister , bollobs and kozma .",
    "here we explain in general terms how we obtain the mean field approximation , but for more details , see our companion paper in this issue of network science @xcite .    in a _",
    "mean field approximation _ , we assume that the properties of interest are uniform over the graph , which means that each node in the graph behaves in a similar manner and that each node has the same neighbourhood size @xmath11 . therefore , equation ( [ eq : psym ] ) only depends on the number of active nodes in @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath12 . to obtain the probability of a node",
    "being active given the majority rule in ( [ eq : psym ] ) , we need to know the probability of a neighbourhood having @xmath12 active nodes .",
    "the mean field assumption , implying uniform neighbourhoods over the entire graph @xmath20 , suggests we can reduce the graph to one equation that explains the behaviour for all nodes . because all nodes are similar with respect to their neighbours , we can model the probability of a node being active at time point @xmath9 by a random draw of any of the nodes in the graph at time point @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we therefore obtain a binomial probability , wherein the number of active nodes in the neighbourhood @xmath19 is considered , and has @xmath11 bernoulli trials that each have a success probability @xmath21 , the proportion of active nodes .",
    "the majority rule determines the size of the neighbourhood to be evaluated since we obtain @xmath22 for all neighbourhood sizes with active nodes up until @xmath23 , and @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "let @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the integer part of @xmath19 . then ,",
    "as balister et al . showed and restated in waldorp and kossakowski , we obtain the probability of a node being active given the majority rule ( [ eq : psym ] ) @xmath27 plugging in different values for @xmath22 , ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , we obtain a _ bifurcation diagram _ , of which an example is shown in figure [ fig : bifurcation_ex ] . in a bifurcation diagram the repeated application of @xmath30 is applied to updated values of @xmath31 such that the last section of the orbit is displayed @xcite .",
    "such diagrams show what kind of behaviour can be expected to be generated by the process . here",
    "we see that there are two kinds of situations : ( a ) a stable situation , where irrespective of the starting point , the process ends up at that stable fixed point , and ( b ) a bistable situation where the process could suddenly switch between states ( phase transition ) .",
    "the parameter value @xmath22 at which the process changes from a stable to a bistable situation is called the critical point . in figure",
    "[ fig : bifurcation_ex ] the critical value lies at @xmath32 ; the parameter area @xmath33 is bimodal where phase transitions can occur , whereas the parameter area @xmath34 represents a unimodal area where the mean field is stable .    .",
    "@xmath35 = the network s density .",
    "@xmath22 = the probability used in equation ( [ eq : mfatorus]).,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    the probability for the mean field in ( [ eq : mfatorus ] ) is designed for a torus with a fixed neighbourhood size @xmath11 . in the context of psychology and psychopathology , it is hard to come up with a graph representing the interactions between symptoms , that would take the form of a grid ( torus ) .",
    "we therefore also looked at the mean field approximation for a _ random graph _ and a _ small - world graph_.    a random graph @xmath36 is a graph structure with @xmath1 nodes and a ( constant ) probability @xmath37 for an edge to be present in the graph @xcite . in the mean field approximation of a random graph ,",
    "the neighbourhood size @xmath19 is a random variable that is maximally @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the integer part of the expected number of neighbours with probability of an edge @xmath40 .",
    "the probability for a node to become active given the graph s density at time point @xmath6 and the edge probability then becomes ( see companion paper in this issue ) @xmath41 the difference with the probability on the grid is in the size of the neighbourhood , here for the random graph @xmath42 it is @xmath43 and in the grid @xmath20 it is @xmath44 , where is @xmath11 often is 5 in a two - dimensional grid ( 4 neighbours and the node itself at the previous time point ) .",
    "it can be shown that this approximation for the probability of a node being active is accurate ( see companion paper in this issue ) .",
    "a small - world graph is a graph where , compared to a random graph , the average clustering is high and the average path length is low @xcite .",
    "a modified version of the small world graph is the newman - watts ( nw ) small - world graph @xcite . in the nw small - world @xmath45",
    "the @xmath1 nodes each have a neighbourhood @xmath19 as in the grid and edges are added to the graph following a ( constant ) wiring probability @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we can then split up the probability in a part associated with the grid and a part associated with the random graph .",
    "the part for the grid is adjusted such that it corresponds to no other edges being present , i.e. , we obtain @xmath47 .",
    "then for the random part we obtain exactly those possible edges that could be included in the neighbourhood out of the remaining @xmath48 nodes that are possibly active , i.e. , @xmath49 , which denotes the probability as in ( [ eq : mfarandomgraph ] ) but starting at @xmath50 . then the probability for a node to become active given the graph s density at time point @xmath6 and the wiring probability in the small - world graph @xmath51 is @xmath52 the small - world probability is therefore a combination of the probability on the grid and on a random graph , proportionately weighted . in sum",
    ", a mean field approximation reduces a graph to a single equation , which we then can use to explain the graph s behaviour at different values for @xmath22 .",
    "our objective is to determine from time series of the density of a graph obtained from real data , an estimate of whether or not this person is at risk of suddenly transitions to a different state , perhaps depression .",
    "one way of obtaining such a risk assessment is to determine where in a bifurcation diagram a person is located ; is this in the stable area , where no transition can occur , or is it in the bistable area where a transition can occur . in order to do this , we need to estimate the parameter @xmath22 of the majority rule . here",
    "we use maximum likelihood ( ml ) to obtain an estimate of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we recognise in the pca ( see also the companion paper in this issue ) that we can relatively easily find the transition probability to go from @xmath53 to @xmath54 active nodes by the fact that we have for each of the graphs @xmath20 , @xmath42 , and @xmath51 a binomial process with a probability of success particular to each type of graph .",
    "it follows that transition probability that the number of active nodes @xmath55 given that at @xmath6 is is @xmath56 in the graph @xmath20 is @xmath57 the transition probabilities for the random graph @xmath42 and the small - world graph @xmath51 are similar except that we change the probability of success to @xmath58 or @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "if we take a closer look at equations ( [ eq : mf - base ] ) and ( [ eq : mfatorus ] ) , it can be noticed that all parameters are known prior to the analysis , with the exception of the probability parameter @xmath22 . to obtain the probability parameter @xmath22",
    ", we can estimate it from the data using ml estimation .",
    "we then obtain the maximum of the log - likelihood for the majority rule parameter @xmath22 .",
    "we write the transition probability in going from state @xmath53 to state @xmath54 ( number of active nodes ) in ( [ eq : transition - prob ] ) from @xmath6 to @xmath9 as @xmath60 .",
    "the log of the joint probability function ( loglikelihood ) for the number of active nodes is then @xmath61 we do not assume stationarity and so can not simplify the log - likelihood to terms consisting only of the states and not on time @xcite .",
    "we then maximise the log - likelihood function in ( [ eq : loglik ] ) with respect to @xmath22 to obtain its estimate from an empirical time series , making it possible to place that person on the bifurcation diagram and assess the risk of possible switching .",
    "in both the random and small - world graph we have additional graph parameters : in the random graph we have the probability of an edge @xmath40 , and in the small - world graph we have the probability of wiring @xmath62 .",
    "estimating @xmath40 is not strictly necessary since we have an estimate simply by counting the number of present edges and dividing by the number of possible edges .",
    "but for the wiring probability @xmath62 in the small - world graph , it may be useful as there is no method yet to determine this .",
    "such an estimate is obtained by maximising the log - likelihood with respect to @xmath62 .",
    "obviously , for small graphs this will be difficult since we work with the nw small - world , implying that a grid structure is in place and some additional edges are randomly added .",
    "we used simulated data from waldorp & kossakowski to validate the estimation of @xmath22 and the graph parameters @xmath37 and @xmath46 .",
    "these data were simulated in order to evaluate the accuracy of the mean field approximation .",
    "we varied the size of the network @xmath1",
    "@xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 , the number of time points @xmath17 @xmath63 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 , and the probability @xmath22 @xmath63 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 .",
    "we also varied @xmath37 @xmath63 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath76 and @xmath46 @xmath63 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath76 for each of the 100 simulation runs , we used the @xmath77 set of active and inactive nodes to optimize @xmath22 and the graph parameters .",
    "all simulated data , figures , and the used r - code are publicly available at the osf . for clarity of presentation , figures are only presented for @xmath78 , as results for @xmath79 and @xmath80 are similar in nature",
    ".    for each simulation run , we calculated the absolute difference between the value @xmath22 , under which the data were simulated , and @xmath81 , which we estimated from the data .",
    "we denoted this difference by @xmath82 , after which the mean absolute difference ( @xmath83 ) is determined for each condition .",
    "the lower this value , the closer the estimate @xmath81 is to the original value @xmath22 .",
    "the same procedure was performed to determine the accuracy for graph parameters @xmath37 ( @xmath84 ) and @xmath46 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "figure [ fig:3d - accuracy - p ] shows a 3d representation of the mean absolute difference between ( @xmath83 ) the simulated parameters @xmath22 , and @xmath81 for selected configurations .",
    "it can be seen that the mean absolute difference for @xmath22 is low for all different network structures .",
    "the only exception to this is shown in the middle column of figure [ fig:3d - accuracy - p ] , where @xmath83 is somewhat higher at low values for @xmath22 , and decreases as @xmath22 increases , similar to the results found in figure 8 of the companion paper in this issue .    > * * m0.75in > m1.5 in > m1.5in > m1 in & torus & random graph & small world graph + @xmath86 &   &   &   + @xmath87 &   &   &   + @xmath88 &   &   &   + @xmath89 &   &   &   + & & & +    the same conclusion can not be made for graph parameters @xmath37 and @xmath46 , as seen in figure [ fig:3d - accuracy - nspc ] . for a random graph ,",
    "@xmath84 is high when @xmath37 is low , and decreases .",
    "this shows that graph parameter @xmath90 is most accurate when @xmath37 is high .",
    "a possible explanation for this finding could be found in the connectedness of random graphs .",
    "when @xmath37 is small , the probability that not all nodes are connected increases , resulting in isolated nodes .",
    "when we look at the minimum probability @xmath37 , such that the graph is connected for different @xmath91 , we see that @xmath37 must be at least 0.46 when the network size is 16 , 0.31 when the network size is 25 , 0.17 when the network size is 49 and 0.09 when the network size is 100 .",
    "thus , as @xmath37 increases , the probability for the network to be connected increases , and as a result of this , @xmath84 decreases .",
    "the reverse is true for a small world graph , where @xmath85 is high when @xmath46 is high and @xmath22 is low , and that it decreases when @xmath46 also decreases . here",
    ", high values for @xmath46 indicate large deviations from the grid ( torus ) structure , and thereby the approximation becomes less accurate .",

    "in the following section , we will demonstrate how the probability of a symptom to be active @xmath22 and the probability for an edge to be rewired @xmath46 can be estimated from empirical data .",
    "both random graphs and small world graphs are found in real - world networks , like social networks @xcite , co - author networks @xcite , and psychopathological symptom networks @xcite . as there is currently no valid test to distinguish a random graph from a small world graph , we assume all graphs to be a random graph in the following empirical examples .    in the following three paragraphs",
    ", we will show three empirical examples and demonstrate how the proposed method works on each of these datasets . by showing the application of our proposed method on three different kinds of data , we aim to show how our proposed method works for different participants , and different types of data .",
    "the first is a dataset of a single participant that contains almost 1500 measurements that were collected in a period of 239 days .",
    "the second is a dataset of patients who were admitted as patients on closed , psychiatric ward of an academic hospital .",
    "lastly , the third example is a dataset of healthy participants who were originally recruited in a nation - wide study @xcite .",
    "the data in these examples are time - series data .",
    "when collecting these types of data , participants are asked to complete a questionnaire several times a day .",
    "these questionnaires often contain items regarding a participant s current mood state , but can also hold items regarding a participant s physical condition , for example . in the first example , the participant s waking hours were divided into ten intervals . in each of these intervals , the participant received a ` beep ' and was asked to complete the questionnaire at that specific point in time . for the other two examples , the time of the beeps were a priori set .",
    "these beeps , in turn , correspond to the time points in time - series data .",
    "for example , when a participant completed twenty questionnaires , the data contains @xmath93 time points .",
    "each empirical example has a similar set - up .",
    "we first start with removing items that were left unanswered for all time points , since these items can not transport any information through the network and thus can not be used be used to assess the risk for a critical transition .",
    "items that were not answered ( missing ) were replaced with the answer at the previous time point @xmath94 , hereby replacing any missing data that may be present in the data . for each item",
    ", we determined how many times each response option ( either 0 or 1 ) was recorded . in the case that one of the two response categories was observed less than four times , the item will be removed from the entire analysis .",
    "the data that is left after this process is then used to estimate @xmath22 and @xmath46 .",
    "after these data cleaning steps , we estimate the network structure using the ` r`-package ` isingfit ` version 0.3.1 @xcite .",
    "isingfit obtains edge coefficients by means of @xmath95-penalized nodewise regressions .",
    "as shown in ravikumar , wainwright and lafferte , this procedure results in a sparse network with a high probability of correct zero and non - zero estimates of the edge coefficients .",
    "the higher the @xmath95-penalty ( denoted by @xmath96 ) , the stronger the penalty and the more edges that are set to zero .",
    "the @xmath95-penalty needs to be chosen carefully : is the penalty too high , we may end up with a network without any edges . if the penalty is too low , we may end up with a network that is neither sparse nor informative . in order to select the most appropriate @xmath95-penalty",
    ", we test for values in the range \\{@xmath97 } at which value the fewest number of edges are being pushed to zero .",
    "we then select this value to estimate the network .    when the network structure is determined , following hosenfeld et al .",
    ", we also calculated the bimodality coefficient ( bc ) , which reflects the distribution of the graph densities .",
    "the bc ranges between zero and one , where a bc @xmath98 indicates a bimodal distribution , and a bc @xmath99 a unimodal distribution .",
    "the bc may also indicate whether or not a participant is at risk for a critical transition : an individual with an increased risk will have a distribution that resembles a bimodal distribution , whereas an individual with no increased risk will have a distribution that resembles a unimodal distribution @xcite .",
    "lastly , we use ml estimation to optimize @xmath22 ( equation [ eq : loglik ] ) from the data .",
    "a participant will have an increased risk for experiencing a critical transition when @xmath81 is smaller than the critical point .",
    "when @xmath81 is greater than the critical point , we conclude that the participant in question does not have an increased risk for experiencing a critical transition .",
    "all analyses were performed using the r statistical software 3.3.1 @xcite .",
    "network visualization were done with the r - package qgraph version 1.3.5 @xcite .",
    "kernel densities for the bc are calculated in r using silverman s rule of thumb @xcite as default for the bandwidth parameter .",
    "our first empirical example is a single - case study of a 57-year old man who has been suffering from major depressive disorder for more than eight years @xcite . by means of esm @xcite ,",
    "the participant s daily life experiences were monitored for 239 days .",
    "ten times a day , the participant was asked to complete a 50-item questionnaire .",
    "see kossakowski et al . for a more detailed description of the data .",
    "it was shown in wichers et al . that the participant experienced a phase transition around day 127 .",
    "it is therefore an ideal dataset to validate whether the risk for experiencing a phase transition can be assessed . in order to validate our proposed method ,",
    "it is necessary to only use the measurements prior to the phase transition , as we want to determine whether this participant showed an increased risk for experiencing a phase transition prior to the transition itself .",
    "therefore , we only selected data up until the anti - depressant medication was reduced to 0 mg , which includes 671 time points .",
    "we excluded 22 items from the entire analysis as they pertained to the social company the participant was in at the time of the beep ( 9 items ) , an activity the participant engaged just before the beep ( 6 items ) , or a significant event that had taken place just before the beep ( 7 items ) .",
    "we included 28 items that measured the participants mood , affect , self - esteem and physical condition , which were completed on 671 time points over a period of 14 weeks .",
    "seven positive items were recoded so that high scores indicate a more negative affect on all items .",
    "the included items were measured on a 7-point likert scale , ranging from 1 ( not ) to 7 ( very ) .",
    "four items ( ` i feel down / lonely / anxious / guilty ' ) were measured on a 7-point likert scale , ranging from -3 ( not ) to + 3 ( very ) , as a pilot trial showed that this type of likert scale resulted in more variation than the original likert scale .",
    "for all 28 items , we dichotomised the data by means of a median split : scores below the median were marked ` 0 ' , and scores above the median were marked ` 1 ' .",
    "after dichotomising the data , we determined the number of observations for each response category ( 0/1 ) and each item . in the case that one of the two response categories was observed less than four times , the item was removed .",
    "three items were removed due to observing one of two response categories less then four times , ending up with a dataset that contains 25 items .",
    "the network structure of this data is depicted in figure [ fig : panel_esm ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "item meanings and their assigned labels can be found in table [ tab : esm_labels ] .",
    "positive associations are denoted by green edges , whereas negative associations are denoted by red edges .",
    "the thicker and more saturated the edge , the stronger the association @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that all items are connected : the entire network has a connectivity of 0.27 , meaning that 27% of all possible edges",
    "are nonzero .",
    "also , item 12 ( i feel strong ) has strong connections to items 2 ( i feel down ) , 17 ( i like myself ) , 19 ( i doubt myself ) and 25 ( i am sleepy ) , which means that , as item 12 increases , scores in items 2 , 17 , 19 and 25 tend to decrease , and vice versa . also note that there is a strong positive association between items 2 ( i feel down ) and 15 ( i worry ) ; as the participant feels more down , he will also worry more and vice versa .",

    "in this paper , we showed how a mean field approximation can be used to assess the risk that individuals may have in experiencing a ( phase ) transition , both from a healthy mood state to a depressed mood state , and from a depressed mood state to a healthy mood state . in a validation study , it was shown that @xmath22 and @xmath46 are accurately estimated by the model . by giving three different empirical examples",
    ", we demonstrated how the mean field approximation works in practice , by applying it to not only a sample from the clinical population and a sample from the general population , but also to a participant from which it was known that the participant experienced a phase transition .",
    "results from that analysis validates the approach that we took in assessing the risk for a phase transition .    in this study",
    ", we estimated ising models for each participant , by assuming that all measurements are independent of each other .",
    "however , this assumption may be hard to satisfy when questionnaires are completed several times a day .",
    "it is possible that participants will think back to the last completed questionnaire , and complete the new questionnaire in light of the previous one .",
    "as measurements are possibly dependent , this could result in a bias in the network estimation .",
    "this bias can be more apparent when participants are asked to complete ten questionnaires a day in comparison to only two questionnaires a day .",
    "future research should thus focus on developing a more robust estimation procedure that does not include the assumption of independent measurements .",
    "in both the clinical and the general sample , results showed that all participants did not have an increased risk for experiencing a critical transition .",
    "for both these samples , there was no follow - up to see whether or not these participants actually experienced a critical transition . in the case of the clinical sample",
    ", a follow - up may reveal whether patients , who show an increased risk for a critical transition , actually underwent that transition in order to return to a healthy mood state again . for the general sample ,",
    "it is unclear whether participants already received a clinical diagnosis .",
    "it could very well be the case that participant who scored high on the depression questionnaires , but did not show an increased risk for a critical transition , may already be clinically depressed , or just are in a bad place during the data collection . without any follow - up , it is hard to tell what caused the results , and what the results actually mean . for future research ,",
    "it is important to include a follow - up measurement when collecting esm - data for these purposes , so that we gain more insight into the causes and consequences of the found results .",
    "when collecting time - series data , participants are requested multiple times a day to fill out a questionnaire for a certain period .",
    "this type of data collection demands time and energy of the participants .",
    "it thus makes sense that participants sometimes forget to complete a questionnaire , or are simply not up for it at that specific moment , for whatever reason . in the data that we analysed , we came across different ratio s of missing data and completed measurements . in this paper",
    "it was assumed that the response scores did not change at the missing measurement , and as a result , missing measurements were replaced by the previous one . adopting this approach for handling missing data also decreases the variance that individual items may have , thereby increasing the probability that items need to be removed due to too little variance . at this point in time",
    ", there is no clear picture of the effects of missing data in time - series analysis like the one proposed and applied in this paper .",
    "future research should focus on mapping the effects that different types of missing data have on time - series analysis , and what the effect of various imputation methods have on the analyses .",
    "lastly , in this study we assumed all network structures to be random graphs . ideally , we would want to be able to distinguish between different types of network structures , by using a test .",
    "we ran a validation study to test whether we can make this distinction by comparing the network s degree distribution with a simulated degree distribution of a similar network structure .",
    "results of this study showed that using the degree distribution to distinguish between a small world graph and a random graph is not possible .",
    "future research could focus on developing such a test , as waldorp and kossakowski showed that the bifurcation diagrams are not all that similar , and different conclusions can be made when using a different network structure .    in conclusion ,",
    "our findings indicate that the mean field approximation is capable in properly assessing the risk that individuals may have in experiencing a critical transition .",
    "the proposed method could potentially aid clinical therapists by giving information about the risk for a critical transition that patients suffering from mdd may have , and therefore the ` risk ' that patients may have in transitioning back into a healthy phase .",
    "also , individuals that have recovered from mdd can potentially be assisted by monitoring their risk for a relapse in mdd .",
