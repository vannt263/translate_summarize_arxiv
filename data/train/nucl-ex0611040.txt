    "the total nucleon spin is the sum of the quark spins , gluon spins and orbital angular momentum within the proton .",
    "experiments at slac and cern in the 1970s-1990s showed that the quarks carry a relatively small fraction of the nucleon spin ; this is sometimes called the spin crisis. rhic will measure the gluon polarization , via quark - gluon and gluon - gluon interactions .",
    "the polarized gluon distributions are found by comparing the normalized rates for collisions where the proton spins are pointing in the same vs. in opposite directions , although much more data is needed , already it is possible to exclude the most extreme models of gluon polarization @xcite .",

    "the two channels are indistinguishable , so they interfere .",

    "@xmath13 is not an observable , so the total cross section is the integral of eq .",
    "this interference has been observed through a reduction in cross section for @xmath14 @xcite .    because of the strong nuclear fields ,",

    "gluons have a virtuality ( @xmath19 dependent transverse area @xmath20 . at high densities ( i.e. at low @xmath21 )",
    ", partons will recombine , in reactions like @xmath22 . this recombination moderates the growth in gluon density as @xmath21 decreases . because of the higher parton density , recombination is more significant in nuclei , and comparisons of parton distributions in protons and in nuclei are sensitive to these changes ; the difference measured in lepton - nucleon interactions is known as shadowing .",

    "it compares charged - particle production in @xmath23 and @xmath0 collisions at different pseudorapidity @xcite .",
    "higher pseudorapidity corresponds to higher-@xmath21 partons from the deuteron , and lower-@xmath21 partons from the gold ; as expected from recombination , shadowing is larger at lower-@xmath21 .     and @xmath0 collisions ( normalized to the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions ) at different pseudorapidity . in the absence of nuclear effects , @xmath24 should equal 1 .",
    "@xcite.,width=288 ]    different theoretical studies have used bfkl and/or dglap evolution , or taken advantage of the relationship between shadowing and diffraction",
    ". one interesting new approach , the colored glass condensate ( cgc ) treats the gluon fields in the nucleus as a classical field .",
    "the cgc makes some interesting predictions @xcite ; a cgc should interact coherently as a single object , producing some new effects .",
    "when a parton interacts with a cgc , the cgc recoils coherently ; because of it s high mass , the recoil is muted , leading to apparent monojets. without a cgc , 2 parton @xmath25 2 parton reactions like @xmath26 produce two azimuthally back - to - back jets .",
    "however , if the gluon strikes a cgc , the heavy object will recoil slowly , and the recoiling gluon will produce the single visible jet .",

    "rhic heats nuclear matter by colliding heavy ions .",
    "the collisions occur in several stages .",
    "initially , the ions collide and their partons interact , producing new partons .",

    "production at small momentum differences , @xmath65 . by measuring the increased particle production at small momentum differences ,",
    "the source size can be inferred . at freezout ( last interaction ) , central gold - gold collisions have a gaussian radius of about 6 fm , about twice the size of the original system .",

    ". any large differences between systems should be due to the interactions between the produced particles and the nuclear medium .",
    "the time scale for fragmentation ( whereby partons fragment into hadronic jets ) is relatively long compared to the time a parton remains in the fireball , so medium interactions should involve the produced parton , rather than the final - state hadrons . energy loss in the medium will manifest itself as a reduction in high @xmath12 particle production as energetic particles are shifted to lower @xmath12 .",

    "hadrons with a color charge are heavily suppressed ; photons are not.,width=288 ]    in perturbative qcd , the suppression depends on the parton density in the fireball and the parton - parton cross section . for the standard pqcd cross sections , the observed energy loss requires a parton density of 1100 - 1200 gluons / unit of rapidity @xcite .",
    "this is far higher than the density inferred from the final state multiplicity .",
    "@xmath70 has also been measured for heavy quarks .",
    "since heavy quarks have a lower velocity ( for a given momentum ) than lighter quarks , less radiative energy loss is expected .",

    "this data fits a model where the high @xmath12 particles come from parton interactions near the surface of the fireball .",

    "high @xmath12 partons produced near the surface , pointing outward produce full - scale jets , with normal near - side correlations .",
    "the suppression factor @xmath70 depends on the surface to volume ratio of the system .",

    "the blast wave model does an excellent job of modelling soft particle production at rhic .",
    "however , the fit parameters imply very high interaction cross sections ; these cross sections do not agree with expectations from pqcd based particle interactions .",
    "several related puzzles are also of interest :    \\1 ) the elliptic flow is at the hydrodynamic limit , with the produced matter behaving like an almost perfect fluid .",
    "\\2 ) the @xmath70 measured at high @xmath12 can only be explained in a pqcd framework by an unphysically high local parton density .",
    "\\3 ) the @xmath70 for heavy quarks is similar to that for lighter particles .",
    "these puzzles have led to considerable theoretical speculation .",
    "ed shuryak has proposed that the temperature range @xmath83 is a strongly coupled regime for partons @xcite ; in this non - perturbative phase , there are many very weakly bound colored states / resonances , such as @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , etc .",
    "these states are very lightly bound , so have large radii , leading to rescattering cross sections 10 to 100 times those predicted by pqcd .",
    "similar behavior is seen for atoms that have been tuned ( via a magnetic field ) to be barely bound .",
    "shuryak also pointed out that this strongly coupled qgp ( sqgp ) may be expected based on duality arguments with weakly coupled string theory . at the same time , lattice calculations indicate that meson bound states ( notably including the @xmath7 surrvive up to temperatures considerably above @xmath87 ; this could explain the lack of additional suppression .",
    "these strong interactions may explain the large elliptic flow and reduced @xmath70 .",
    "the strong interactions could also reduce the qgp lifetime ( as is seen in some hbt studies ) . in short , this strongly - coupled phase could explain many of these puzzling observables . of course , detailed quantitative studies are needed .",
    "one measure of the cross section is the fluid viscosity ; elliptic flow depends on the shear viscoity / entropy ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "flow data shows @xmath89 @xcite , indicating that the sqgp is a 100 times better fluid than water .",
    "this viscosity is much lower than that expected for a hadron gas or from a perturbative ( i.e. hotter ) qgp , and appears beyond the reach of perturbative qcd .",
    "in fact , it approaches the quantum limit , @xmath90 , calculated using duality arguments @xcite .",
    "rhic data offers some guidance for modelling cosmic - ray air showers .",
    "nuclear effects are significant ; @xmath1 collisions are not merely superpositions of @xmath0 or even @xmath67 collisions .",
    "a blast - wave model does a good job of explaining soft particle production ; it may be of interest for simple simulations .",
    "three aspects of the rhic data that may be particularly significant are :    \\1 ) the reduced forward particle production in @xmath18 collisions may be due to decreased parton densities in nuclei at low @xmath21",
    ". this may reduce number of high energy muons , and/or affect the downward energy flow in air showers .",
    "more quantitative saturation models are needed to model higher energy interactions .",
    "\\2 ) the strangenss content in nuclear collisions is significantly increased over @xmath0 collisions even at moderate @xmath29 , in @xmath67 and @xmath1 , and , probably , in @xmath91 collisions . at rhic energies ,",
    "the increase is about 50% for nitogren - nitrogen collisions .",
    "since @xmath92 decay faster than @xmath93 , in air showers , they are more likely to decay before interacting , so the increased strangeness should lead to more high energy muons . the increased strangeness will also reduce the @xmath6 fraction in collisions , slowing the conversion of hadronic energy into electromagnetic energy .",
    "this may partially counterbalance the previous item .",
    "\\3 ) lighter systems may be modelled by using the @xmath29 dependence of heavy - ion systems .",
    "a simple explosive - exansion model can explain much of the soft particle production data .",
    "similarly , a surface emission picture can explain a lot ( but not all ) of the high @xmath12 particle production . however , pqcd calculations do not reproduce the parameters required for these models",
    ". it may be that a new non - perturbative qgp is being produced at rhic energies .    over the next few years",
    ", the rhic detectors will upgrade their subsystems .",
    "the major experimental goals are high - statustics studies of open charm and @xmath94 production and of leptonic decays of vector mesons ; the latter may be sensitive to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "another interesting idea is to search for the tricritical point of qcd ; this might be found at non - zero baryon density ; rhic can search for it point by scanning the machine energy ."
