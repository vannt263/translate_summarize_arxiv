    "when a mechanical pressure is exherted on the solid skeleton of a porous medium and its elastic strain is a consequence of the variation of the fluid mass content inside the pores , several interesting phenomena can occur which accompany shrinkage or swelling of the solid skeleton . in this paper attention",
    "is focused on the occurrence of heterogeneous perturbations of the fluid mass density and the skeleton elastic strains , as a consequence of the undrained response of the porous medium .",
    "the classical mandel ",
    "cryer effect , see @xcite and @xcite , provides an explanation , within multidimensional consolidation , of fluid overpressure , in the central region of the sample , immediately after the application of the loading .",
    "however , in that case this is a definitely non  permanent effect which fades away when the fluid leaks out the boundary and the pore pressure reverses and dissipates .",
    "the physical background of the mandel ",
    "cryer effect is that the generation of fluid over - pressure due to loading is immediate , but the dissipation due to the fluid flow is retarded by the permeability and the distance to the drainage boundary .",
    "on the other hand several authors discussed the onset of strain localization during globally undrained triaxial tests , in particular for loose granular materials , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite . in this case",
    "local fluid exchange is allowed , even in presence of localized strain , inside the specimen until , at high level of confinement , the pore pressure generation inside the band leads locally to fluidization of the crushed material , which results into the formation of connected channels in the heart of the band .",
    "similar confinement effects have also been recorded in a fluidized column test , see @xcite , where a fluid is forced to flow through a saturated sample from the bottom . by tuning the velocity of the fluid , the drag force acting on the solid grains , possibly causing unbalance of gravity force ,",
    "is controlled @xcite .",
    "these experimental results demonstrate that under consolidation loading , and because of porosity change , the fluid can migrate through the pores and eventually remain segregated , possibly enhancing localized overpressurization and fluidization of the soil , see e.g. @xcite .    in the papers @xcite and @xcite we have attacked this problem from the point of view of bifurcation theory and we have shown that it is possible to describe interesting phenomena ( still in the range of non  linear elasticity ) taking place when the confining pressure exerted on the solid exceeds a suitable limiting value . the idea is to get a formulation capable for describing the onset of a fluid  rich and a fluid  poor phase , eventually coexisting inside the porous skeleton at equilibrium . introducing a non  local energy contribution , which penalizes gradients of strain and fluid mass density ,",
    "a smooth transition between phases of the porous medium , associated with different fluid content , has been modeled , so accounting for the arising of the above mentioned heterogeneous elastic strains .",
    "undrained conditions are therefore locally achieved where fluid segregation is attained , even if a standard darcean dissipative process , associated to the fluid flowing out of the drainage boundary , occurs .    assuming the potential energy to be quadratic in the first derivatives of the strain and of the fluid mass density variation , the evolution is described by a cahn  hilliard  like equation provided that the dissipative forces are proportional to the seepage velocity , say the velocity of the fluid with respect to the solid .",
    "this means that the above mentioned assumption of darcean flow still remains valid .    within this modeling framework ,",
    "a generalized consolidation problem for a one  dimensional porous continuum is analyzed so extending the classical results due to terzaghi and those ones , relative to a gradient model , previously obtained by one of the authors , and co ",
    "workers @xcite , in which only the fluid ",
    "poor phase was admissible at equilibrium .",
    "the equation governing the behavior of the fluid constituent is of higher ( fourth ) order with respect to the laplace equation which classically prescribes the behavior of the pore ",
    "water pressure . following previous results reported in @xcite ,",
    "different boundary conditions can be considered , in particular essential or natural boundary conditions relative to the velocity of the fluid relative to the solid the fluid chemical potential as well as to the fluid mass density or its spatial gradient ; where the dependence of the boundary value problem on higher order derivatives has been taken into account . here",
    "we shall address the two cases in which zero chemical potential , see section [ s : zch ] , or zero fluid velocity , say impermeability of the porous skeleton , see section [ s : osi ] , have been assumed on the whole or part of the boundary , together with essential boundary conditions on the strain of the solid and the density of the fluid . as already mentioned the interest will be in the occurrence of heterogeneous elastic strains of the solid skeleton and variations of the fluid density ; the confining pressure is therefore chosen so as to guarantee the coexistence of phases and , consequently , the onset and the propagation , up to its stationary placement , of the interface between them , see @xcite .",
    "we introduce the one dimensional poromechanical model @xcite whose geometrically linearized version will be studied in the following sections .",
    "kinematics will be briefly resumed starting from the general statement of the model @xcite together with some particular issue introduced in @xcite .",
    "the equations governing the behavior of the porous system will then be deduced prescribing the conservative part of the constitutive law through a suitable potential energy density @xmath0 and the dissipative contributions through purely darcy terms .",

    "one can arbitrarily choose two among the three fields @xmath16 , @xmath22 , and @xmath17 .",
    "since the reference configuration @xmath10 of the solid component is know a priori , a good choice appears to be that of expressing all the dynamical observables in terms of the fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 which are defined on @xmath10 .",

    "the dot and the prime denote , here and in the sequel , the partial derivative with respect to time and to the space variable @xmath9 respectively .      in @xcite we have derived the equations of motion by using a variational approach much similar to that developed in  @xcite .",
    "we shall recall , here , the main steps in the computation .",
    "it is natural to assume that , if the system is acted upon only by conservative forces , its dynamics is described by a _",
    "lagrangian density _",
    "@xmath38 , relative to the solid reference configuration space volume , depending on the space variable @xmath9 and on time through ( in principle ) @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",

    "accounting for both the internal and the external conservative forces .",
    "the equations of motion for the two fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be derived assuming that the possible motions of the system in an interval of time @xmath45 are those such that the fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 are extremals for the _ action functional _ @xmath46 in correspondence of the independent variations of the two fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 on @xmath47 . in other words",
    "any possible motion of the system in the considered interval is a solution of the euler ",
    "lagrange equations associated to the variational principle @xmath48 .",
    "a different variational principle is needed if the fluid component of the system is acted upon by dissipative forces ; the virtual work made by these forces must be taken into account . consider the independent variations @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the two fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 and denote by @xmath51 the corresponding elementary _ virtual work _ made by the dissipative forces acting on the fluid component .",
    "the possible motions of the system , see for instance ( * ? ? ? * chapter  5 ) , in an interval of time @xmath45 are those such that the fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 satisfies the variational principle @xmath52 namely , the variation of the the action integral in correspondence of a possible motion is equal to the integral over time of minus the virtual work of the dissipative forces corresponding to the considered variation of the fields .",
    "the way in which dissipation has to be introduced in saturated porous media models is still under debate , see for instance @xcite . in particular according to the effectiveness of the hypothesis of separation of scales , between the local and macroscopic level , darcy s or stokes effects are accounted for .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a complete discussion of this problem .    in this paper we shall consider the so  called darcy effect , i.e. , the dissipation due to forces proportional to the velocity of the fluid component measured with respect to the solid . by following phenomenological arguments @xcite or by developing suitable homogenization schemes",
    "it is seen that the fluid flow is , in this case , controlled by the permeability of the porous material . a natural expression for the virtual work of the dissipation forces acting on the fluid component and taking into account the darcy effect",

    "apparently equation ( [ lv01 ] ) for the virtual work of darcy dissipative forces is consistent with the classical expression of darcy dissipation associated with the viscous flow through a porous continuum , see @xcite .",
    "following the recipe described above we have to express the virtual work in terms of the field @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in @xcite it has been proven that @xmath57    in order to write explicitly the variation of the action we specify , now , the form of the lagrangian density . in the sequel we shall not consider the inertial effects , so that , the lagrangian density will be the opposite of the potential energy density associated to both the internal and external conservative forces . as it has been shown in  @xcite ( see equation  ( 18 ) therein )",

    "we have studied the above pde problem with the same numerical approach used for the stationary problem .",
    "the dissipative evolution of the elastic strain @xmath63 and the fluid mass density variations @xmath82 , relative to the zero chemical potential boundary condition and the one  side impermeability condition , are discussed for different initial conditions , say : @xmath161 _ linear _ initial condition connecting the two phases , @xmath162 _ fluid  poor phase _ initial condition , @xmath163 _ fluid  rich phase _ intial condition .",
    "we remind that in the case of one side impermeability condition the chemical potential is still required to vanish at @xmath164 . in figures [ rettaduepuntivecchio][tappofluid ] the corresponding profiles of the elastic strain , the fluid mass density variation and the seepage velocity ( defined as in ) are reported at different times .",
    "figures [ rettaduepuntivecchio ] and [ rettaduepuntitappo ] refer to the evolution of the system starting from spatially linear initial conditions for @xmath63 and @xmath82 connecting the standard ( fluid  poor phase ) on the left to the fluid  rich phase on the right .",
    "the evolution can be divided into two macroscopically different regimes : the first one is the formation of the connection profile , while the second one is a sort of travelling wave which represents the slow propagation of the profile towards the stationary state .",
    "the transition between the two above  mentioned regimes is associated to the showing up of a characteristic velocity profile ( see , for instance , the three bottom rows in figure  [ rettaduepuntivecchio ] ) that we shall call the _ late time _ velocity profile . in the following",
    "we will analyze separately the two regimes of the evolution , comparing the profiles relative to the considered boundary conditions .    comparing figures [ rettaduepuntivecchio ] and [ rettaduepuntitappo ] , one can observe that close to the boundary where impermeability is prescribed , strain and fluid density variations suffer a jump .",
    "this is mainly due to the delay of the system in modifying its initial state according with the prescribed boundary condition and , in particular , to the fact that no flow through the right boundary is allowed .",
    "on the other hand , when considering the zero chemical potential boundary condition , the formation of the profiles do not pass through this intermediate step .",
    "consequently the second regime of the evolution process is reached more quickly and this is witnessed also by the formation of the characteristic late time velocity profile . in both cases the formation of the connection profile is accompanied by a significant swelling of the solid matrix in that part of the domain where a significant fluid admission is observed .    in order to understand the formation of the connection profile , i.e. , the first part of the evolution , one has to look at the first four rows , corresponding to times @xmath165 , in figures  [ rettaduepuntivecchio ] and [ rettaduepuntitappo ] .",
    "close to the left boundary the behavior of the zero chemical potential and that of the one  side impermeable problem are very similar . on the other hand",
    ", they are pretty different ( as expected ) close to the right boundary .",
    "indeed , in both cases a fluid emission occurs through the left boundary point , as it can be deduced by noting that in the neighbourhood of the left boundary , the seepage velocity is negative ( see the corresponding third column graphs ) .    in the zero chemical potential case",
    "the profile formation is due to two counterbalancing effects : fluid displacement from the central region of the sample , where a fluid excess ( with respect to the stazionary state ) is present at the initial times , towards the right and fluid supply through the right boundary point .",
    "this can be easily deduced by looking at the velocity profile which is positive in the central region and negative close to the right boundary ( see the first three graphs from the top of the right column in figure  [ rettaduepuntivecchio ] ) . on the other hand , in the one  side impermeable case , no fluid supply is possible through the right boundary point ( notice that the velocity profile is zero in this case , see figure  [ rettaduepuntitappo ] ) , so that the profile formation is due to the only effect of the central fluid displacement . as a result , in this last case",
    "the profile formation is slower and the profile is formed more to the right with respect to the zero chemical potential case .",
    "notice , for instance , that the velocity peak at time @xmath166 is at @xmath167 in the zero chemical potential case and at @xmath168 in the one  side impermeable one .    at the end of the formation regime",
    ", the velocity profile assumes , in both case the peculiar late time shape with two maxima and to minima and intensity values significantly lower with respect to the previous time steps .",
    "this can be observed , for example in the zero chemical potential case , by comparing the value of the velocity peak a time @xmath169 , where its intensity is about @xmath170 , and time @xmath166 where its intensity is about @xmath171 .",
    "as we have already noticed , we remark that the profile formation is faster in the zero chemical potential boundary conditions than in the other case ; indeed , the late time velocity profile is neatly formed at time @xmath166 in the first case , while in the second one it is necessary to wait till time @xmath172 .",
    "once the characteristic late time velocity profile is formed , the slow propagation towards the stationary state starts .",
    "this motion , in this case of linear initial condition and , as we will see , in the case of the fluid  rich phase initial condition , is characterized by a negative peak intensity larger than that of the positive one .",
    "this property is due to the choice of the initial condition : indeed , since the profile motion towards stationarity proceeds from the left to the right , an amount of water has to go out from the medium , and this is reflected in a bigger negative part in the velocity profile .    finally , we note that the stationary profile is reached in the one  side impermeable case faster than in the zero chemical potential one .",
    "it is important to remark that this is not a physically relevant effect , but is simply due to the choice of the initial condition . indeed , due to our choice , in the one  side impermeable case the profile forms very close to the stationary one .    ,",

    "thus , the same physical arguments discussed in the previous case continue to be valid even in this case .    in the very early times of the profile formation , both for the zero chemical potential and the one  side impermeable cases ,",
    "the evolution is characterized by a big deviation in the @xmath63 profile , from the standard initial value , to large values outside the range @xmath181 .",
    "a similar abrupt behavior is not observed for the fluid density profile : the deviation below the @xmath182 value ( dashed lines ) , is present , but much smaller .",
    "the corresponding velocity profiles are characterized , in the neighbourhood of the right boundary , by large negative values in the zero chemical potential case and large positive values in the other one .",
    "this behavior has a rather clear physical interpretation : as a large amount of fluid has to be accumulated close to the right boundary , in the zero chemical potential case it is retrieved from the exterior through the right boundary point , while in the other case , due to the impermeability of the right boundary , such a fluid has to quickly arrive from the central part of the interior of the sample .",
    "as in the case of linear initial conditions this fluid accumulation implies a swelling of the solid skeleton , whose amplitude is much more significant with respect to that stemming from linear initial conditions .",
    "it is very interesting to remark that when the density profile is almost formed , see the fifth row in figure  [ tappostandard ] corresponding to time @xmath183 , the seepage velocity attains negative values also close to the right boundary .",
    "we can intepret this fact by imagining that a certain amount of fluid is now present in that physical region and it starts to move to the right in order to push the profile towards the stationary position .",
    "it is again possible to observe that , as in the previous case and for the same reason , a sort of discontinuity appears in the @xmath63 profile in the one  side impermeable case ( see figure  [ tappostandard ] at time @xmath184 ) .",
    "finally , once the profile is formed , again we observe the peculiar late time velocity graph . in this case , in contrast to the previous one , such a profile has a positive part bigger that the negative one .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for the present initial condition , it happens that the travelling wave has to propagate in the opposite direction .    ,",

    "the system is started with an eccess of fluid throughout the sample .",
    "the profile matches the dirichelet boundary condition on the right , so that the only phenomenon that has to happen is the fluid escape through the left boundary point . for this reason the evolutions in the zero chemical potential and the one  side impermeable one are very similar .    with respect to the cases discussed before it is interesting to remark that no sort of discontinuity appears in the @xmath63 and @xmath82 profiles close to the right boundary .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that nothing relevant is happening close to such a boundary point .",
    "the two evolutions show differences at times @xmath186 and @xmath187 , see figures  [ vecchiofluid ] and [ tappofluid ] . indeed , the velocity profiles are very similar at early times the positive part is almost the same in both cases , in the late steps the velocity profile concerning the evolution with the zero chemical potential has positive values in the middle of the porous medium and in the neighbourhood of the right boundary , unlike the velocity profile related to the evolution with the impermeability condition , where the velocity profile is all negative in the same region .",
    "once the profile is formed again the late time velocity graph shows up and slowly proceeds towards the stationary state moving from the left to the right .",
    "this is consistent with negative peak of the velocity which is greater than the positive one .",
    "finally we can observe that a similar behavior as that relative to the fluid ",
    "poor initial condition can be detected concerning the presence of a kind of jump of the @xmath63 profile outside the range @xmath181 , which now concentrates close to the left boundary , while @xmath82 has a correspondent overshoot above the @xmath188 value . in this case",
