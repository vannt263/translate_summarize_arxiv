    "this model is amenable to numerical full quantum calculations , so far up to @xmath1 particles@xcite .",
    "these results and mean - field calculations agree for a short time while for longer times the full quantum approach shows that the system reaches a state , that one may call  statistically stationary \" as we shall specify below , punctuated by coherent revivals . here",
    ", we revisit the symmetric two - mode bose - hubbard model within numerically exact quantum calculations to , first , verify the previous results and , second , to accomplish a more detailed description of the self trapping transition .",
    "the mean - field approach , which approximates the @xmath0-body dynamics by a set of non - linear coupled dynamical equations , is limited and incomplete since it describes the evolution of the expectation values of one - body operators only . however , from the full quantum dynamics one may , in principle , enquire about the dynamics of one- , two- , three- , and up to @xmath0-body properties . due to the relative simplicity of the present model one can calculate either",
    "the full @xmath0-body wave function for a pure state or the full @xmath0-body density matrix for a mixed state ( for a system up to @xmath2 10,000 particles , say ) .",
    "thus , full information of the state of the system may be obtained .",
    "anyhow , from a macroscopic point of view , most of the measurable thermodynamic and/or many - body properties , such as energy , temperature and green s functions in general , are given in terms of one- and two - body operators@xcite .",
    "these in turn are exhaustively described by the one- and two - body reduced density matrices .",
    "although we are able to calculate the complete one- and two - body density matrices from the exact solution , here for purposes of showing our main points we shall limit our study to the following measurable quantities : the number of particles in one of the wells , given by the expectation value of a one - body operator @xmath3 , and a tunneling correlation function , the expectation value of a two - body operator @xmath4 .",
    "below we give the explicit form of these operators .",
    "our results may be summarized as follows . since we are dealing with a macroscopic system , following the principles of statistical mechanics , we choose to describe the state of the system by specifying the number of particles @xmath0 and the expectation value of the energy @xmath5 ; that is , we shall work in a microcanonical ensemble . for this to be meaningful ,",
    "we must limit ourselves to states whose energy mean - square deviation is small ; in other words , to states localized in energy but not necessarily the energy eigenstates . for purposes of calculations",
    "we use a well - known family of coherent states@xcite such that the previous requirement is satisfied .",
    "we point out here that the particular state with all particles initially in one of the wells , analyzed in most of the studies with full quantum solutions@xcite , belongs to the family of such coherent states .",
    "the first important conclusion is that , for all the above mentioned initial states and for all values of the strength of the particle interactions , the system reaches a state that can be called  statistically stationary \" .",
    "that is , the distributions of the _ time - dependent _ expectation values @xmath6 and @xmath7 are peaked around a value dependent only on @xmath0 and @xmath5 , with a width that becomes relatively smaller as @xmath0 is increased ; in other words , the distribution of those values is sharply peaked .",
    "secondly , we find that the _ mean _ values of those distributions follow the same function as the expectation values of the operators @xmath8 and @xmath4 in the energy eigenstates , truly stationary states .    for small values of the interaction strength , typically , the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 oscillate following the coherent oscillations predicted by the mean - field calculation for a brief period of time , then  decay \" to a stationary value for a long period of time ( e.g. @xmath9 ) followed by revivals .",
    "as the number of particles is increased , the time spent in the revival regions and the time spent in the stationary region both increase . however , the ratio of the latter to the former also increases , such that most of the time is spent in the stationary region .",
    "could this process be called _ decoherence _ ?",
    "it certainly so if experimentally one is able to measure few ( i.e. one- and two- ) body properties only .",
    "after all , this is what statistical physics asserts : any _ isolated _ system left undisturbed for a long time relaxes to a stationary ( equilibrium ) state . for larger values of the interaction not only the decay to stationary states",
    "occurs , but also the transition to self - trapped states appears .",
    "the main result is that there exists a critical value of the interaction , such that if the interaction is greater than this value , the self - trapping transition occurs as a function of the energy of the system .",
    "we recall that since the one - particle spectrum is finite ( i.e. just two states ) , the @xmath0-body set of allowed energy values is bounded from above and below .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly present the hamiltonian of the system and the quantities to be analyzed .",
    "we then show results that display the existence of the statistically stationary states and we discuss the transition from delocalized to the self - trapped states .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results and additional aspects of the phenomenology of this system , such as its characterization in different ensembles .",
    "we model the interacting quantum fluid confined in the double well through the bose - hubbard hamiltonian considering the two - mode approximation@xcite    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the tunneling frequency of the two lowest energy modes in a symmetrical two well potential and @xmath12 represents the effective particle - particle interaction strength written in terms of the ( positive ) @xmath13-wave scattering length @xmath14",
    ". we shall specify the different regimes by the adimensional interaction parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the model may also be seen as the collection of @xmath0 atoms with two internal states in an external static field , and whose pair interaction is long range and only acting if the particles are in the same internal state .",
    "we shall return to this version in the last section .",
    "we use units with @xmath16 .",
    "as it has been already established , for particular initial states the system described by hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) exhibits a continuous transition from particle coherent oscillations to a self - trapping regime when the parameter @xmath17 is increased from zero to above a critical value @xmath18 .",
    "this transition may also occur for a fixed value of @xmath17 , by varying the initial state , which is equivalent to varying the energy of the system . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the experiment by albiez et al.@xcite using bose atoms at very low temperatures , reports the observation of a self - trapped state as a function of the initial population imbalance .",
    "it proves convenient to introduce the one - body operators@xcite , @xmath19 that obey the su(2 ) commutation relations , @xmath20 = i \\varepsilon_{klm } j_m$ ] , and the number of particles @xmath21 . with these identifications",

    "it is believed , that such an approximation is valid for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , but @xmath17 finite@xcite .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , this procedure gives information , within the limit considered , on one - body properties only .",
    "nevertheless , this approximation is susceptible of extensions to systems with external time - dependent fields , whose implementation in exact ( numerical ) quantum calculations may be quite difficult .    by solving for the full @xmath0-body wavefunction @xmath28",
    "one can calculate the @xmath0-body density matrix @xmath29 , and with this , the reduced one- and two - body density matrices , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , whose matrix elements are , @xmath32 and @xmath33 with the greek subindices taking the values 1 and 2 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 , that is , the values @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . knowledge of these two operators suffices to determine all one- and two - body properties of the system . although , we can calculate all the matrix elements of @xmath30 and @xmath31 as a function of time , we find more illustrative to limit ourselves to two properties , one is the number of particles in well 1 , namely , @xmath39 a one - body operator ; and the other is a  tunneling correlation \" , @xmath40 a two - body operator .    before studying the time evolution of initial coherent states , we analyze the properties of the eigenstates of the system .",

    "we note that this is a transition as a function of the energy for given @xmath17 , that is , there is an energy @xmath55 above which the system self - traps . in fig .",

    "we have dubbed  delocalized \" states as opposite to self - trapped . in the mean - field approach",

    "as already pointed out in the literature@xcite , the dynamical study of the interacting bose system with hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) reveals , in addition to the opposite coherent and self - trapped states , stationary states with recurrent revivals which mean - field treatments are unable to capture .",
    "the existence of these stationary states is due , both , to the pair - particle interaction energy and to the fact that we are looking at expectation values of few - body operators .",
    "the revivals are consequence of the finite number of eigenstates comprising any conceivable state in this system . to exhibit this phenomenolgy we consider the following family of coherent states@xcite ,    @xmath64    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the number of particles in wells 1 and 2 , and @xmath67 are the ( @xmath42 ) fock states .",

    "below , we explore the whole energy region for the same values of @xmath17 .",
    "the purpose of these figures is to exemplify two important conclusions of our analysis .",
    "first , based on the facts that macroscopically and experimentally we are very much limited to access physical properties of few bodies only , such as energies , temperatures and correlations functions , then , if we can make measurements of , say , @xmath88 and @xmath89 at different times ( starting each realization in the same state ) , one necessarily arrives to the conclusion that the system is , within fluctuations , around a mean stationary value .",
    "we shall call these state _ statistically _ stationary states to distinguish them from the true stationary energy eigenstates .",

    "we have verified that the behavior shown here for the coherent state @xmath73 and @xmath74 , is typical for any value of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    ", we would like to briefly discuss the role of the temperature in this problem .",
    "first , we recall that an isolated system is best described by a microcanonical ensemble , and in fact , this is how we have described the system .",

    "the results of the correlation tunneling @xmath89 seem to indicate that there is no agreement between the  microcanonical \" and the  canonical \" descriptions . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] one finds that the thermal average of @xmath8 is always @xmath114 , whether above or below the transition .",
    "this is not a discrepancy since the thermal canonical average can not show the spontaneous symmetry breaking ; it is analogous to the fact that in the ising model in 2d the average magnetization is always zero : one needs a small external magnetic field to break the symmetry and then make it to vanish@xcite .",
    "the somewhat perplexing problem is in the behavior of the average values of the two - body tunneling correlation @xmath76 , since the peak is not shown in the thermal averages .",
    "we do not have an explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "it may either be that our calculation based on the eigenstates and the coherent states do not correspond to a microcanonical ensemble , or that for this system there is simply no equivalence between ensembles .",
    "the latter option can not at all be disqualified . in a way",
    "this system is peculiar since it represents a collection of atoms interacting with the same strenght with all the other atoms , provided they are in the same internal state . in other words ,",
    "the fact of considering the two - mode approximation only has given rise to an effective hamiltonian in which the interactions among the particles appear as if they were long range , whenever the particles have the same internal state , while the full hamiltonian represents particles with short range interactions .",
    "moreover , it can also be shown , by studying eq.([eter ] ) , that the energy as a function of temperature and number of particles is not fully extensive , namely , it is not of the form @xmath115 with @xmath116 a function of the energy only , but rather , @xmath117 .",
