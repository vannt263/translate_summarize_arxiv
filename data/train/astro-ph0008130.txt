    "after the discovery of the circumstellar ring around supernova ( sn ) 1987a , several authors pointed out that the supernova blast wave should strike the ring some 10  20 years after the supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "the estimated time of first contact was uncertain , mainly because it depended on the unknown density of circumstellar gas between the supernova and the ring .",
    "this event is now underway . in 1995",
    "an unresolved spot at position angle @xmath4 ( spot 1 ) on the near ( north ) side of the ring began to brighten @xcite .",
    "this spot continues to brighten , and within the last year several new spots have appeared @xcite . a shock interpretation for these spots was suggested by space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) observations of the ring taken in 1997 @xcite . the spectral image of the ring in h@xmath5  showed a streak at the position of spot 1 indicating blueshifted emission with velocities up to @xmath6 .",
    "evidently , at the positions of the spots , the blast wave is striking inward protrusions of the dense equatorial ring .    here",
    "(  2 ) we report on early optical and ultraviolet stis spectra of snr 1987a which show several broad lines associated with spot 1 . in ",
    "3 we present the radiative shock model for the emission from the spots , and in  4 we discuss what we can infer from the spectrum and its evolution .",
    "the supernova intensive study ( sins ) collaboration obtained stis spectra of spot 1 at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths in 1997 september and 1998 march , respectively . the ultraviolet spectrum ( not shown )",
    "was taken on september 27 , 1997 ( 3869.3 days since explosion ) with the g140l low dispersion grating ( 1150  1736   , @xmath7 ) and a @xmath8 slit .",
    "five spectral images totaling @xmath9 were combined .",
    "emission lines from nearly stationary gas in the ring are apparent at nv @xmath10 , oiv ] @xmath11 , niv ] @xmath12 , and heii @xmath13 .",
    "emission from spot 1 is also visible in these lines , as well as at siiv @xmath14 , [ niv ] @xmath15 , and civ @xmath16 .",
    "the low - velocity siiv and civ emission from the ring is blocked by interstellar absorption @xcite .",
    "due to geocoronal ly@xmath5emission no information about ly@xmath5  from the spot was obtained .",
    "the optical spectrum was taken on march 7 , 1998 ( 4030.0 days since explosion ) , with a @xmath17 slit and the g750 m grating ( 6295  6867   , @xmath18 ) .",
    "three spectral images totaling @xmath19 were combined .",
    "a section of the optical spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ optspect ] .",
    "the central horizontal streak ( which extends to @xmath20 ) is h@xmath5  emission from the radioactively heated supernova debris .",
    "pairs of bright spots where the slit intersects the stationary inner ring are evident in [ nii ] @xmath21  and h@xmath5(not displayed but also present are [ oi ] @xmath22 , hei @xmath23 , and [ sii ] @xmath24 ) .",
    "three fainter spots due to the outer rings are also visible in h@xmath5  and [ nii ] .",
    "broad streaks of emission from spot 1 appear on the upper segments of the ring lines .",
    "these streaks are inside the ring emission indicating that spot 1 lies at the inner edge of the ring .        the spectra of spot 1 are extracted from the stis spectral images . for the optical emission lines ,",
    "the major source of contamination is the emission from the nearly stationary ( @xmath25 , @xcite @xcite ) circumstellar ring filling the @xmath26 slit .",
    "the h@xmath5  line profile is shown in figure  [ haprofile ] .",
    "the parts of the line profiles that lie outside of the ring emission are fit well by gaussians .",
    "the velocity shifts of the gaussian fits are poorly constrained since the spot s spatial position in the slit is uncertain . in the ultraviolet",
    "the ring emission is much weaker and therefore its contribution to the extracted spot 1 spectrum is neglected .",
    "the uv lines are poorly resolved at the resolution of the g140l grating .",
    "it is possible to account for the detector line spread function in order to obtain intrinsic widths for the uv lines @xcite .",
    "while this method introduces errors in the determined width , we find that all the uv lines have intrinsic widths @xmath27 .",
    "all the lines from spot 1 were fit with gaussians in order to extract their fluxes and full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the errors stated in table 1 are @xmath28 statistical errors to the fits .",
    "close multiplets ( nv @xmath10  and civ @xmath16 ) were fit simultaneously by requiring a set wavelength separation , identical widths , and line ratios dictated by their oscillator strengths . for the nv doublet ,",
    "the emission from spot 1 overlapped with very broad ly@xmath5emission ( @xmath29 ) from the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "this ly@xmath5  background was removed using a quadratic fit and is the source of the large uncertainty in the nv @xmath10flux . at the g140l resolution ,",
    "the siiv @xmath30 emission of spot 1 is mixed with that from the oiv ] @xmath11  multiplet . using the measured siiv @xmath311394 flux and assuming @xmath32 , the siiv @xmath30 flux was determined and removed from the oiv ] @xmath11  multiplet .",

    "the absorption profiles for these lines are known from _ iue _ high - dispersion spectra of sn 1987a taken at the time of outburst @xcite .",
    "since the intrinsic profiles of the lines are poorly known , correcting for this absorption is a somewhat uncertain endeavor .",
    "for now we just present the observed fluxes and note that under reasonable assumptions of the intrinsic profiles we find correction factors of @xmath66 for these lines @xcite .",
    "figure  [ cartoon ] illustrates the scenario that we believe accounts for the emission from spot 1 .",
    "the freely expanding supernova ejecta are slowed from @xmath67 to @xmath68 by a reverse shock .",
    "the shocked gas drives a blast wave ( forward shock ) , with velocity @xmath69 , into an hii region having density @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the bright spots occur where the blast wave encounters protrusions of the dense ( @xmath71 , @xcite @xcite ) equatorial ring .",
    "as it enters a protrusion , the blast wave is slowed to a value @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the angle between the surface of the protrusion and the propagation direction of the blast wave .",
    "the function @xmath74 , which accounts for shock obliquity and the pressure increase due to the reflected shock , varies from @xmath75 at the head of the protrusion to @xmath76 along its sides @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect a range of shock velocities , @xmath77 , to be present ( where @xmath78 is the pre - shock density in units of @xmath79 ) .",
    "an important parameter for the shocks considered here is the radiative cooling time @xmath80 , defined as the time for the shocked gas to cool from the post - shock temperature , @xmath81 , to @xmath82 .",
    "a fit to the results from a plane - parallel steady - state ( 1d - ss ) shock code ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) with abundances appropriate to sn 1987a @xcite shows that , for @xmath83 , @xmath84 .    when these spectra were taken , the age of the spot , @xmath85 , was comparable to the cooling time for shocks with the range of densities and velocities expected in the protrusion .",
    "shocks with velocities @xmath86 have @xmath87 and would not yet have radiated away their energy , while slower ( radiative ) shocks will have had time to cool and will convert all their thermal energy into radiation .",
    "non - radiative shocks produce far less ultraviolet and optical emission than radiative shocks . therefore , although faster shocks might be present , we expect the ultraviolet and optical emission from spot 1 to be dominated by shocks with speeds @xmath88 .",
    "the radiative shock model does predict the presence of both strong uv and optical lines .",
    "the ultraviolet lines produced in a radiative shock come mainly from the cooling region , where the shocked gas s thermal energy is radiated away .",
    "the optical lines , however , are formed in the cool layer of dense ( @xmath89 , where @xmath90 ) gas which forms behind the cooling region .",
    "this photoabsorption layer quickly becomes thick enough to absorb the downstream ionizing radiation produced in the cooling region and converts the flux into optical emission lines .",
    "the optical lines are formed with thermal widths characteristic of @xmath91 gas .",
    "the actual profiles are much broader and must be due to the macroscopic motion of fluid parcels in the photoabsorption layer . in a steady shock , the gas in the photoionization zone will have the same velocity as the shock front , and therefore the optical lines would be expected to have velocity profiles representative of the hydrodynamics of the shock ( specifically , those parts of the shock that have developed a radiative layer ) . the presence of both redshifted and blueshifted emission can be explained by shocks traveling both into and out of our line of sight ( see figure  [ cartoon ] ) .",
    "it will not be an easy task to develop a quantitative model for the spectrum and line profiles of the hot spot . as figure 3 illustrates , these result from a superposition of shocks having a range of velocities and aspect angles that depend on the unknown geometry and density structure of the protrusion .",
    "our task is further complicated by the fact that radiative shocks are subject to violent thermal and dynamical instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) , so steady shock models may be inadequate to interpret the spectrum .    despite the complexity of the actual situation",
    ", we can gain some insight into the physical conditions in the spot by comparing the actual spectra with the results from the 1d - ss shock code .",
    "for example , the code shows that the ratios of the flux of nv @xmath10  to the flux of lines from lower ionization states ( oiv ] @xmath11 , niv ] @xmath12 , and civ @xmath16 ) are sensitive functions of shock velocity .",
    "nv is not produced at temperatures @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , above which its emissivity rises rapidly with shock velocity .",
    "on the other hand , oiv , niv , and civ all form at lower temperatures and their emissivities are less sensitive to velocity . to reproduce the observed ratios with the shock code",
    "we must constrain the shock velocity to the range @xmath94 . but",
    "such a velocity range conflicts with the observed optical line widths , which require radiative shocks with velocities up to at least @xmath95 .",
    "however , only @xmath96 of the emission in the broad h@xmath5  line profile comes at high velocity ( @xmath97 , measured from line center ) .",
    "we may then argue that only @xmath96 of the h@xmath5emission must come from shocks faster than @xmath98 .",
    "if this is true , the line ratios will be dominated by emission from the slower shocks .",
    "we find that if the slower shocks ( @xmath99 ) cover about four times the surface area than the faster shocks ( @xmath100 ) , then the net emission from these shocks produced ratios near those observed .",
    "the presence of both fast and slow radiative shocks indicates that the protrusion must have a slightly higher density than the average ring density . using hydrodynamical arguments presented in  3",
    "we find that preshock densities @xmath101 are required to produce shocks as slow as @xmath98 .",
    "a less stringent lower limit is provided by an independent argument based on the radiative cooling time .",
    "preshock densities of @xmath102 are required for shocks as fast as @xmath2 ( as indicated by the h@xmath5  line width ) to cool within @xmath103 years .",
    "we can also use the spectroscopic data to estimate the surface area of the shock interaction .",
    "most of the emission comes from shocks with velocities @xmath104 , for which the shock code gives an h@xmath5surface emissivity of @xmath105 . correcting the observed h@xmath5flux for reddening @xcite and assuming a distance of @xmath106",
    ", we find that the shock must have an h@xmath5  emitting surface area of @xmath107 ( assuming @xmath108 ) .",
    "then , assuming a hemispherical shape for the emitting surface , we estimate that spot 1 should have a characteristic dimension @xmath109 ( or @xmath110 ) . this is smaller than hst s resolution",
    "so we are not surprised that the spot is spatially unresolved .",
    "as table 1 indicates , different emission lines have different widths .",
    "this is expected , since the emissivities of the lines are sensitive functions of shock velocities , and a range of shock velocities is clearly in evidence .",
    "moreover , the differences among the optical line widths may be explained by partial cooling in fast shocks .",
    "emission from ions like oi and sii comes from regions downstream of the gas that produces h@xmath5  emission .",
    "faster shocks take longer to develop these downstream regions .",
    "the fastest shocks that produce h@xmath5  will not yet have developed their [ oi ] and [ sii ] emitting zones .",
    "therefore , the [ oi ] and [ sii ] lines are narrower than the h@xmath5  line .    now that several new bright spots have appeared on the circumstellar ring of sn 1987a @xcite",
    ", we have new opportunities to elucidate the development of radiative shocks . by observing the spectra of each of the spots",
    ", we can follow the development of shocks having different ages and velocities .",
    "the spots will continue to brighten and their spectra will change .",
    "the pressure that drives the shocks will increase , the shocks will engulf more of the protrusions , and faster shocks will develop radiative layers .",
    "the most powerful constraint on the hydrodynamics will be to resolve the line ratios as a function of doppler velocity .",
    "for example , the wings of the nv @xmath10line profile should be more prominent than those of civ @xmath16 .",
    "as the optical lines brighten , their wings should broaden .    for these reasons , it is imperative to observe the development of the spectra of these spots on a regular basis .",
    "these observations will need to be performed by stis in order to obtain uv line profiles as well as spatially distinguish the spectra of the different spots .",
