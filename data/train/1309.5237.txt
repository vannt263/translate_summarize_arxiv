    "phospholipids are a major component of biological membranes , and the structural analysis of pure lipid membranes is an important area of research , as it can provide valuable insights into membrane function , including how the membrane s mechanical properties can affect lipid / protein interactions @xcite . of the liquid crystalline mesophases formed by phospholipids in aqueous solutions ,",
    "most effort has been expended to liquid crystalline ( fluid ) bilayers ( @xmath0 ) , because of their biological significance .    over the years scattering techniques , such as small angle x - ray and neutron scattering ( saxs , sans )",
    "have been widely used to determine the structural parameters and mechanical properties of biomimetic membranes . with regard to bilayer structure , two important structural parameters are bilayer thickness and lateral area per lipid @xmath1 @xcite ; the latter is directly related to lipid volume and inversely proportional to bilayer thickness .",
    "importantly , @xmath1 plays a key role in the validation of molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations @xcite , as such its value for different lipids must be accurately known . over the years for a given lipid , a range of values for @xmath1",
    "have been reported @xcite . since lipid volumes",
    "are determined from independent and highly accurate densitometry measurements @xcite , differences in @xmath1 must therefore result from differences in bilayer thickness . to accurately determine lipid areas , a precise measure of the luzzati thickness @xmath2 @xcite , which is given by the gibbs dividing surface of the water / bilayer interface @xcite , is needed .",
    "other frequently used definitions of bilayer thickness are the headgroup - to - headgroup thickness @xmath3 and the steric bilayer thickness @xcite .",
    "the latter two bilayer thickness definitions can also be used to determine @xmath1 , however , assumptions regarding headgroup size or distance to the chain / headgroup interface have to be made .",
    "there are two important issues which one must consider when measuring membrane thickness .",
    "firstly , due to the thermal disorder of fluid bilayers , there is no distinct division between lipid and water , instead a water concentration gradient exists at the membrane s interface .",
    "secondly , x - rays and neutrons are sensitive to different parts of the bilayer .",
    "x - rays , for example , are strongly scattered from the electron dense phosphate group which is part of the phosphorylcholine headgroup , hence accurate values for @xmath3 can be obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "neutrons are scattered by atomic nuclei . since , hydrogen and its isotope deuterium scatter neutrons with similar efficiency , but 180 degrees out - of - phase with each other ( i.e. , deuterium s coherent scattering length is positive , and hydrogen s is negative ) . in the case of protiated lipid bilayers sans",
    "is highly sensitive to locating the hydrogen depleted carbonyl groups .",
    "importantly , however , is that neutron contrast can be easily tuned by varying the hydrogen - deuterium content of the water ( by varying the @xmath4/@xmath5 ratio ) or of the bilayer ( through the use of deuterated lipids ) @xcite",
    ". as mentioned , in the case of protiated lipid bilayers in 100% @xmath5 , neutrons are most sensitive to the lipid s glycerol backbone .",
    "moreover , the gibbs dividing surface for the apolar / polar interface is typically located between the headgroup phosphate and the lipid backbone .",
    "therefore a combined analysis of x - ray and neutron data should yield the most accurate values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xcite . in this combined data analysis ,",
    "commonly known as the scattering density profile ( sdp ) model , the lipid bilayer is represented by volume distributions of quasi - molecular fragments , which are easily converted into electron density or neutron scattering length density distributions by simple scaling ( for a given molecular group ) the appropriate electron or neutron scattering length density ( see @xcite , for a recent review ) .",
    "scattering techniques are also capable of probing membrane elasticity .",
    "lipid bilayers are two - dimensional fluids which exhibit significant bending fluctuations of entropic origin . in multilamellar arrangements , _ e.g. _ ,",
    "in mlvs or surface supported multibilayers , this leads to a characteristic power - law decay of the positional correlation function , known as quasi long - range order , with bragg peaks having characteristic line shapes @xcite .",
    "membrane elasticity can , therefore , be determined from line - shape analysis of the bragg peaks and the underlying physics of this phenomenon is described by the caill @xcite or modified caill theory ( mct ) @xcite . the resulting fluctuation , or caill parameter @xmath6 is a function of the bilayer bending modulus and the bulk modulus of interbilayer compression . due to the higher resolution data in reciprocal space , compared to neutrons , x",
    "- rays are better suited for determining the shape of bragg peaks .    just over",
    "a decade ago , pabst and coworkers were the first to report a full @xmath7-range analysis of mlv saxs data using mct @xcite . in that method ,",
    "quasi - bragg peaks and diffuse scattering were both taken into account when analyzing the data , and the electron density profile was modeled by a simple summation of gaussians representing the electron rich lipid headgroup and electron poor ( in relation to the headgroup ) hydrocarbon chains .",
    "selected examples of this saxs method of data analysis can be found in the recent reviews by pabst and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the work described here extends the global analysis program ( gap ) for mlvs by making use of sdp s description of the lipid bilayer .",
    "this modified technique , termed herein the sdp - gap model , has several advantages .",
    "firstly , compared to extruded unilamellar vesicles ( ulvs ) , spontaneously forming mlvs are easier to prepare @xcite . secondly , sdp s description of the bilayer imparts to gap the ability to simultaneously analyze sans and saxs data , while enabling sdp to determine bending fluctuations , and hence bilayer interactions .    in the present study we also attempted to determine precise values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 using standalone x - ray data",
    "such analysis , however , is complicated by the use of more fitting parameters , as compared to gap , and inherently less scattering contrast , as compared to the sdp model , which makes use of both sans and saxs data . to address these shortcomings we used a genetic algorithm , as an optimization routine , in combination with physical information from other sources in order to reduce the number of parameters needed by the sdp - gap model . to test the new sdp - gap model",
    ", we analyzed a series of saturated and unsaturated phospholipids , as well as binary lipid mixtures with cholesterol .",
    "results compare favorably with previously reported data obtained using the sdp model , including the commonly accepted bilayer condensation effect induced by cholesterol .",
    "we also include sans data of protiated and deuterated palmitoyl - oleoyl phosphatidylcholine ( popc ) in our analysis , which gives rise to a better resolved location of the lipid s glycerol backbone . compared to standalone saxs analysis , differences in @xmath1 and @xmath2 values obtained from the sdp - gap model are observed but the differences are well within experimental uncertainty .",
    "1,2-dipalmitoyl-_sn_-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( dppc ) , 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-_sn_-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( popc ) , 1-palmitoyl(d31)-2-oleoyl-_sn_-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( popc - d31 ) , 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-_sn_-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( sopc ) , 1,2-dioleoyl-_sn_-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( dopc ) were purchased from avanti polar lipids , alabaster al , and cholesterol was obtained from sigma - aldrich ( austria ) .",
    "99.8% @xmath5 was obtained from alfa aesar ( ward hill , ma ) .",
    "all lipids were used without further purification .    for x - ray experiments , lipid stock solutions ( dppc , dopc , sopc , dopc ) were prepared by dissolving predetermined amounts of dry lipids in chloroform / methanol ( 2:1 , v / v ) . binary mixtures with cholesterol ( 20mol% )",
    "were obtained by mixing lipid stock solutions in the appropriate ratios .",
    "lipid solutions were subsequentially dried under a stream of nitrogen and placed under vacuum for about 12 hours , forming a thin lipid film on the bottom of glass vials .",
    "films were hydrated using 18m@xmath8/cm water by incubation for 2 hours above the lipid melting temperature , with vortex mixing every 15min .",
    "the final lipid concentration for each sample was 50mg / ml .    for neutron experiments ,",
    "mlvs of popc - d31 at 10mg / ml were prepared by weighing 15 mg of dry lipid powder into 13@xmath9100 mm glass culture tubes and hydrating with 1.50ml @xmath5 preheated to 40 , followed by vigorous vortexing to disperse the lipid .",
    "the resultant mlv suspension was incubated at 40  for 1 hour with intermittent vortexing , and then subjected to 5 freeze / thaw cycles between -80 and 40  to reduce the average number of lamellae and facilitate extrusion @xcite .",
    "a 0.75ml aliquot of the mlv sample was then used to prepare unilamellar vesicles ( ulvs ) using a hand - held miniextruder ( avanti polar lipids , alabaster , al ) , assembled with a 50 nm pore - diameter polycarbonate filter and heated to 40 .",
    "the suspension was passed through the filter 41 times .",
    "ulv samples were measured within 24h of extrusion .",
    "final sample concentrations were 10mg / ml , which allows for sufficient water between vesicles to eliminate the interparticle structure factor , thereby simplifying data analysis .",
    "x - ray scattering data were acquired at the austrian saxs beamline elettra trieste , italy using 8kev photons .",
    "diffraction profiles were detected utilizing a mar300-image - plate detector ( marresearch gmbh , norderstedt , germany ) and calibrated using a powder sample of silver behenate .",
    "lipid dispersions were taken up in 1 mm thick quartz capillaries and inserted into a multi - position sample holder .",
    "lipid dispersions in capillaries were equilibrated for a minimum of 10min prior to measurement at a predetermined temperature with an uncertainty of @xmath10  using a circulating water bath .",
    "exposure time was set to 240sec .",
    "scattering patterns were integrated using the program fit2d @xcite . background scattering originating from water and air was subtracted , and data sets were normalized using the transmitted intensity , which was measured by a photodiode placed in the beam stop .",
    "neutron scattering experiments were performed using the extended q - range small - angle neutron scattering ( eq - sans , bl-6 ) beamline at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) located at oak ridge national laboratory ( ornl ) .",
    "ulvs were loaded into 2 mm path - length quartz banjo cells ( hellma usa , plainview , ny ) and mounted in a temperature - controlled cell paddle with an 1  accuracy . in 60hz operation mode , a 4 m sample - to - detector distance with a @xmath11 wavelength band was used to obtain the relevant wavevector transfer .",
    "scattered neutrons were collected with a two - dimensional ( 1m@xmath91 m ) @xmath12 position - sensitive detector made up of 192@xmath9256 pixels .",

    "is given by the caill theory , and is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "averaging over variations in scattering domain size was performed following @xcite .",
    "one of the important parameters determined from fitting @xmath20 using mct is the caill parameter @xmath6 , which is a measure of bending fluctuations @xcite .",
    "instrumental resolution was taken into account by convoluting equation([eq : intensity2 ] ) with the beam profile @xcite .",

    "a detailed description of volume probability distribution functions can be found in @xcite .",

    "an additional methine ( ch ) group was added for unsaturated hydrocarbon chains .",
    "however , the constrast between ch and ch2 is weak , even for sans @xcite , and effectively zero for saxs .",
    "hence , our parsing scheme combined the ch with the ch2 group ( fig.[fig : parsing_scheme ] ) .    to avoid any non - physical results ,",
    "the following constraints were adopted from @xcite . because of bilayer symmetry ,",
    "the position of the terminal methyl group @xmath24 was set to zero and the height of the error function , which describes the hydrocarbon chains , was set to one in order to comply with spatial conservation .",
    "the width of the choline methyl group @xmath25 was fixed to @xmath26 , and the width of the error function describing the hydrocarbon chain was constrained within accepted limits ( @xmath27\\,\\mathring{\\text{a}}$ ] ) @xcite .",
    "we also implemented new constraints to aid the standalone x - ray data analysis .",
    "firstly , the distances between the cholch3 and pcn groups , and the hydrocarbon chain interface ( @xmath28 ) and cg ( @xmath29 ) groups , were not allowed to exceed @xmath30 .",
    "secondly , volumes of the quasi - molecular fragments , necessary for calculating electron or neutron scattering length densities , were taken from previous reports @xcite and allowed to vary by @xmath31 .",
    "the total volume of the headgroup components ( i.e. , cholch3 , pcn , and cg ) were constrained to a target value of @xmath32 , as reported in @xcite , whereby the value is allowed to deviate from the target value , but in doing - so , incurring a goodness - of - fit penalty .    for lipid mixtures with cholesterol ,",
    "cholesterol s volume distribution was merged with the ch2 group , following @xcite .",
    "this is justified on the basis of cholesterol s strong hydrophobic tendency , which dictates its location within the hydrocarbon chain region , and the fact that its hydroxyl group resides in the vicinity of the apolar / polar interface @xcite . in calculating the lipid area for binary mixtures the apparent area per lipid @xmath33",
    "was used @xcite .",
    "the bare volume of cholesterol within lipid bilayers was taken to be @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "based on volume probability distributions and scattering length density profiles , membrane structural parameters were defined as follows : ( i ) the headgroup - to - headgroup distance @xmath3 is the distance between maxima of the total electron density ( i.e. , the sum of the component distributions ) ; ( ii ) the hydrocarbon chain length @xmath35 is the position of the error function representing the hydrocarbon region @xmath28 ; and ( iii ) the luzzati thickness @xmath2 is calculated from the integrated water probability distribution @xcite : @xmath36    the volume distribution function of water was previously defined in @xcite @xmath37 where i indexes the lipid component groups ( i.e. , cholch3 , pcn , cg , ch2 , and ch3 ) . in order to increase the robustness of the analysis for @xmath2 , @xmath38 obtained from the sdp analysis was fitted with an error function , thus giving greater weight to the region close to the lipid headgroup ( due to the higher x - ray contrast ) , as compared to the hydrocarbon chain region .",
    "we also attempted to include the @xmath38 model function in the sdp fit , however results were not satisfactory .",
    "the area per lipid is then given by @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the molecular lipid volume determined by separate experiments .",
    "finally , the thickness of the water layer was defined as @xmath41 unless otherwise stated , experimental uncertainties of all structural parameters , including literature values , are @xmath42 .      due to the large number of adjustable parameters ( i.e. , 21 ) and our goal to apply the sdp - gap model to standalone x - ray data , we chose to use a genetic algorithm in the optimization routine .",
    "the main benefit of this algorithm , compared to simple gradient descent routines or more sophisticated optimization algorithms ( e.g. , levenberg - marquardt ) , is that the fitting procedure does not easily fall into local minima @xcite .",
    "several hundred generations with populations of   2000 individuals were tested for their fitness , defined here as the reduced chi - squared ( @xmath43 ) value , which is equal to the sum of the squared residuals divided by the degrees of freedom @xcite . if @xmath43 does not change after 100 generations , the optimization is assumed to have converged and the procedure is terminated .",
    "application of genetic algorithms comes with a greater computational cost , but are efficiently using parallel processing techniques . for the present study ,",
    "all routines were encoded in idl ( interactive data language ) , using the solber optimization routine @xcite .",
    "typical runtimes for one x - ray scattering profile were between three and five hours on a six core machine ( intel xeon 2.67ghz ) .",
    "the sdp - gap model was tested on saxs data obtained from single component @xmath0 lipid bilayers and selected binary mixtures of phosphatidylcholines with cholesterol . as an example of our analysis , we present results for sopc bilayers with five lamellar diffraction orders ( fig.[fig : sopc - fit ] ) .",
    "fits from all other bilayers , including tables with structural parameters , are given in the supplemental material ( figs.s1s3 , tab.s1 ) .",
    "all saxs patterns showed significant diffuse scattering , originating from membrane fluctuations common to @xmath0 bilayers .",
    "in particular , bending fluctuations lead to a rapid decrease in diffraction peak amplitudes as a function of @xmath7 , and @xmath44-bragg peaks with characteristic line - shapes .",
    "such effects are accounted for in the structure factor used .",
    "we found good agreement between the sdp - gap model and experimental sopc data ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "fits from other mlv systems yielded similar @xmath43 values ( tab.s1 ) . omitting the constraints introduced in section [ subsec : modelling of phospholipid bilayer ]",
    "led to slightly improved @xmath43 values , but produced non - physical results .",
    "results from the sdp - gap model were compared to those from the gap model .",
    "gap data was in reasonable agreement with the experimental data ( fig.[fig : sopc - fit ] ) , albeit with poorer fit statistics ( @xmath46 ) , which could be attributed to the small deviations between the various bragg peaks . despite the good fits produced using the gap model ,",
    "the structural features obtained from sdp - gap analysis are significantly richer ( fig.[fig : sopc - fit ] , lower panel ) .",
    "this point is illustrated by the total electron density shown in the inset to fig.[fig : sopc - fit ] , where the methyl trough is smeared out in the gap electron density profile .",
    "table[tab : structural_param ] provides the main structural parameters obtained from sdp - gap and gap analysis of the same data , as well as literature values obtained from sdp analysis ( i.e. , joint refinement of saxs and sans data ) .",
    "calculation of structural parameters using the gap model is detailed in @xcite .",
    "our results using the sdp - gap model are in good quantitative agreement with the reference data .",
    "deviations with the gap model are , however , larger ( though still reasonable ) due to the simplified electron density model that was used .",
    "interestingly , in the case of some lipids , we also find significant differences for the fluctuation parameter .",
    "they are the result of the form factor , which modulates peak decay .",
    "it therefore stands to reason that the better fits of the experimental data by the sdp - gap model should result in more accurate @xmath6 values .",
    "we further tested the sdp - gap model using the same lipid systems , but this time with the addition of 20mol% cholesterol .",
    "cholesterol is abundant in mammalian plasma membranes and is well known for the condensing effect it has on lipid bilayers , which at the molecular level is explained by the umbrella model @xcite . in scattering studies , this effect shows up as an increase in @xmath2 and a concomitant decrease in @xmath1 , as well as reduced bending fluctuations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "fig.[fig : sopcuchol - fit ] shows the fits to data from sopc / cholesterol membranes .",
    "the sdp - gap model is able to describe the more pronounced higher diffraction orders resulting from cholesterol s presence .",
    "our results show that cholesterol shifts the pcn and cholch3 groups further away from the bilayer center ( fig.[fig : sopcuchol - fit ] bottom panel , tab.[tab : effect_cholesterol ] , tab.s2 ) , in good agreement with previous reports @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we could not observe a significant shift of the cg group from the bilayer center , nor a higher value for hydrocarbon chain thickness ( tab.[tab : effect_cholesterol ] , s2 ) .",
    "structural parameters for all lipid mixtures are reported in tab.[tab : effect_cholesterol ] . in agreement with previous reports",
    ", the addition of cholesterol causes @xmath1 to decrease , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 to increase @xcite .",
    "compared to other membrane systems , bending fluctuations in dppc bilayers experience a greater degree of damping when cholesterol is induced , in agreement with the notion that cholesterol preferentially associates with saturated hydrocarbon chains @xcite .",
    "this effect is smaller for lipids having one monounsaturated chain ( i.e. , sopc and popc ) , and is completely absent when a second monounsaturated chain is introduced ( e.g.dopc ) .",
    "this latter finding is in good agreement with studies which found no change in the bending rigidity of dopc bilayers in the absence or presence of cholesterol @xcite .",
    "sopc / cholesterol mixtures were also analyzed with the gap model .",
    "although reasonable fits are obtained ( fig.[fig : sopcuchol - fit ] , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) differences in structural parameters when comparing gap data with sdp - gap data are more pronounced . for example",
    ", the total electron density profiles shows clear deviations in the acyl chain and headgroup regions .",
    "cholesterol increases the asymmetry of the electron density distribution in the headgroup region , as determined from the sdp - gap model , an effect that is not captured by the single headgroup gaussian of the gap model . as a result ,",
    "parameters such as area per lipid ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) and hydrocarbon chain length ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) are different between the two two methods , whereas values for head - to - headgroup thickness ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) and the caill parameter ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) are in reasonably good agreement .",
    "sans data were obtained from popc and popc - d31 mlvs and ulvs in pure @xmath5 to see whether or not additional information substantial alters the results .",
    "the protocol devised by kuerka and coworkers used sans data from proteated bilayers at different @xmath4/ @xmath5 contrasts @xcite .    replacing h with d shifts the neutron scattering length density ( nsld ) profile of the hydrocarbon region from negative to positive values ( fig.[fig : popc - fit]b , insert ) .",
    "hence , relative to @xmath5 with sld @xmath57 , the hydrocarbon chain region contrast is significantly altered .",
    "this change in contrast manifested itself by producing two additional bragg peaks in the case of popc - d31 mlvs , compared to their proteated counterparts ( fig.[fig : popc - fit]a ) .",
    "similarly , ulv data show a shift of the minimum at low @xmath7 to higher @xmath7 vectors for popc compared to popc - d31 ( fig.[fig : popc - fit]b ) , which is also attributed to the change in contrast of the deuterated lipids in @xmath5 .",
    "we used sdp - gap to simultaneously analyze saxs data in several combinations with sans data : ( i ) protiated mlvs ; ( ii ) deuterated mlvs ; and ( iii ) all four sans data sets ( i.e. , deuterated and protiated mlvs and ulvs ) .",
    "we also fit all mlv data sets simultaneously , and all ulv data sets separately . in doing so",
    ", results differed slightly from case ( iii ) , except that case ( iii ) yielded a lower error for the different structural parameters .",
    "fit results are shown in fig.[fig : popc - fit ] and the determined structural parameters are summarized in tab.[tab : simultaneous_analysis ] and tab.s3 .",
    "the addition of a single sans data set produced significant variations in the structural parameters , causing them to deviate from values determined from standalone saxs analysis and those from literature .",
    "this disagreement was rectified by either including both mlv data sets , or all mlv and ulv data sets in the analysis . in the latter case ,",
    "significant differences , compared to the standalone saxs analysis , are found regarding the positions of the cg group @xmath58 and @xmath35 .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the better neutron contrast of the lipid backbone .",
    "changes in volume distribution functions are shown in fig.[fig : popc - fit]c .",
    "the changes to @xmath1 and @xmath2 are within the measurement error , and consequently insignificant .",
    "we thus conclude that the addition of sans data helps to improve the location of the cg group and @xmath35 , but offers negligible improvements to values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we have modified the full @xmath7-range saxs data analysis , which used a simplified electron density profile @xcite , by replacing it with a high resolution representation of scattering density profiles , which are based on volume distributions of quasi - molecular fragments @xcite .",
    "the new sdp - gap is a hybrid model of gap and sdp that combines the advantages offered by each model into one .",
    "the sdp - gap model can be applied to mlv and ulv data , and is capable of simultaneously analyzing saxs and sans data .",
    "an advantage of this new hybrid model is that mlvs are spontaneously formed membrane systems , and their analysis opens up new opportunities for the study of bilayer interactions and membrane mechanical properties ( e.g. , elasticity ) @xcite .    an additional feature of this new model is its ability to obtain high resolution structural information from standalone saxs data .",
    "this is achieved by implementing an optimization routine based on a genetic algorithm , which is able to deal with the large number of adjustable parameters needed , even though additional constraints and input parameters were applied in order to limit parameter space .",
    "compared to the gap and sdp models , which use levenberg - marquardt and downhill simplex optimization routines , respectively , the computational effort required by the sdp - gap model is significantly higher .",
    "typical cpu times on parallel processors are on the order of a few hours , as compared to a few minutes for sdp or gap . however , an advantage is that the genetic algorithm prevents the optimization routine from stalling in local minima . by using different seeds for the random number generator , for a given data set , robust results with good convergence",
    "are readily obtained    we then tested the sdp - gap model using different saturated and unsaturated phosphatidylcholine bilayers , with and without cholesterol .",
    "results for @xmath2 and @xmath1 are in good agreement with previous reports using the sdp model , although we note that the position and width of the cg groups are subject to greater variabilities due to the lower x - ray contrast of this particular group .",
    "this inadequacy was , however , rectified by including ulv sans data .",
    "mlv saxs data combined with ulv sans data of popc and popc - d31 bilayers resulted in improved results for both the position of the cg group and hydrocarbon chain thickness .",
