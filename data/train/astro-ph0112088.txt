    "chemical elements heavier than lithium are synthesized in stars .",
    "such `` metals '' are observed at times when the universe was only @xmath6% of its current age in the inter  galactic medium ( igm ) as absorption lines in quasar spectra ( see ellison et al . 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "hence , these heavy elements not only had to be synthesized but also released and distributed in the igm within the first billion years",
    ". only supernovae of sufficiently short lived massive stars are known to provide such an enrichment mechanism .",
    "this leads to the prediction that    _ the first generation of cosmic structures formed massive stars ( although not necessarily only massive stars ) . _    in the past 30 years it has been argued that the first cosmological objects form globular clusters ( ) , super  massive black holes ( ) , or even low mass stars ( ) . this disagreement of theoretical studies might at first seem surprising .",
    "however , the first objects form via the gravitational collapse of a thermally unstable reactive medium , inhibiting conclusive analytical calculations .",
    "the problem is particularly acute because the evolution of all other cosmological objects ( and in particular the larger galaxies that follow ) will depend on the evolution of the first stars .",
    "nevertheless , in comparison to present day star formation , the physics of the formation of the first star in the universe is rather simple . in particular :    * the chemical and radiative of processes in the primordial gas are readily understood . * strong magnetic fields",
    "are not expected to exist at early times .",
    "* by definition no other stars exist to influence the environment through radiation , winds , supernovae , etc . *",
    "the emerging standard model for structure formation provides appropriate initial conditions .    in previous work",
    "we have presented three  dimensional cosmological simulations of the formation of the first objects in the universe ( , ) including first applications of adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to first structure formation ( , , abn hereafter ) . in these studies we achieved a dynamic range of up to @xmath7 and",
    "could follow in detail the formation of the first dense cooling region far within a pre",
    " galactic object that formed self ",
    "consistently from linear density fluctuation in a cold dark matter cosmology . here",
    "we report results from simulations that extend our previous work by another 5 orders of magnitude in dynamic range . for the first time it is possible to bridge the wide range between cosmological and stellar scale .",
    "we employ an eulerian structured adaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamical code developed by bryan and norman ( , ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical equations are solved with the second order accurate piecewise parabolic method (; ) where a riemann solver ensures accurate shock capturing with a minimum of numerical viscosity .",
    "we use initial conditions appropriate for a spatially flat cold dark matter cosmology with 6% of the matter density contributed by baryons , zero cosmological constant , and a hubble constant of 50 km / s / mpc ( ) . the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations in the dark matter and the gas are taken from the computation by the publicly available boltzmann code cmbfast ( ) at redshift 100 ( assuming an harrison  zeldovich scale  invariant initial spectrum ) .",
    "we set up a three dimensional volume with 128 comoving kpc on a side and solve the cosmological hydrodynamics equations assuming periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this small volume is adequate for our purpose , because we are interested in the evolution of the first pre  galactic object within which a star may be formed by a redshift of @xmath8 .",
    "first we identify the lagrangian volume of the first proto  galactic halo with a mass of @xmath9 in a low resolution",
    "pure n  body simulation .",
    "then we generate new initial conditions with four initial static grids that cover this langrangian region with progressively finer resolution . with a @xmath10 top grid and a refinement factor of 2",
    "this specifies the initial conditions in the region of interest equivalent to a @xmath11 uni ",
    "grid calculation . for the adopted cosmology",
    "this gives a mass resolution of @xmath12 for the dark matter ( dm , hereafter ) and @xmath13 for the gas .",
    "the small dm masses ensure that the cosmological jeans mass is resolved by at least ten thousand particles at all times .",
    "smaller scale structures in the dark matter will not be able to influence the baryons because of their shallow potential wells .",
    "the theoretical expectation holds , because the simulations of abn which had 8 times poorer dm resolution led to identical results on large scales as the simulation presented here .    during the evolution ,",
    "refined grids are introduced with twice the spatial resolution of the parent ( coarser ) grid .",
    "these child ( finer ) meshes are added whenever one of three refinement criteria are met .",
    "two langrangian criteria ensure that the grid is refined whenever the gas ( dm ) density exceeds 4.6 ( 9.2 ) its initial density . additionally , the local jeans length is always covered by at least 64 grid cells cells . ]",
    "( 4 cells per jeans length would be sufficient , ) .",
    "we have also carried out the simulations with identical initial conditions but varying the refinement criteria . in one series of runs",
    "we varied the number of mesh points per jeans length .",
    "runs with 4 , 16 , and 64 zones per jeans length are indistinguishable in all mass weighted radial profiles of physical quantities .",
    "no change in the angular momentum profiles could be found , suggesting negligible numerical viscosity effects on angular momentum transport .",
    "a further refinement criterion that ensured the local cooling time scale to be longer than the local courant time also gave identical results .",
    "this latter test checked that any thermally unstable region was identified .",
    "the simulation follows the non  equilibrium chemistry of the dominant nine species species ( h , h@xmath14 , h@xmath15 , e@xmath15 , he , he@xmath14 , he@xmath16 , h@xmath17 , and h@xmath18 ) in primordial gas .",
    "furthermore , the radiative losses from atomic and molecular line cooling , compton cooling and heating of free electrons by the cosmic background radiation are appropriately treated in the optically thin limit ( , ) . to extend our previous the studies to higher densities three essential modifications to the code",
    "were made .",
    "first we implemented the three  body molecular hydrogen formation process in the chemical rate equations . for temperatures below 300 k we fit to the data of orel ( ) to get @xmath19 . above 300 k we then match it continuously to a powerlaw ( ) @xmath20 .",
    "secondly , we introduce a variable adiabatic index for the gas ( ) . the dissipative component ( baryons ) may collapse to much higher densities than the collisionless component ( dm ) .",
    "the discrete sampling of the dm potential by particles can then become inadequate and result in artificial heating of the baryons ( cooling for the dm ) once the gas density becomes much larger than the local dm density . to avoid this , we smooth the dm particles with a gaussian of width 0.05  for grids with cells smaller than this length . at this scale ,",
    "the enclosed gas mass substantially exceeds the enclosed dm mass .    the standard message passing library ( mpi )",
    "was used to implement domain decomposition on the individual levels of the grid hierarchy as a parallelization strategy .",
    "the code was run in parallel on 16 processors of the sgi origin2000 supercomputer at the national center for supercomputing applications at the university of illinois at urbana champaign .",
    "we stop the simulation at a time when the molecular cooling lines reach an optical depth of ten at line center because our numerical method can not treat the difficult problem of time ",
    "dependent radiative line transfer in multi  dimensions . at this time the code utilizes above 5500 grids on 27 refinement levels with @xmath21 computational grid cells .",
    "an average grid therefore contains @xmath22 cells .",
    "[ colorplate ]      our simulations ( fig .  [ colorplate ] , fig .  [ 5panel ] ) ,",
    "identify at least four characterisic mass scales . from the outside",
    "going in , one observes infall and accretion onto the pre  galactic halo with a total mass of @xmath23 , consistent with previous studies ( , , , abn , and for discussion and references ) .",
    "at a mass scale of about 4000 solar mass ( @xmath24 ) rapid cooling and infall is observed .",
    "this is accompanyed by the first of three valleys in the radial velocity distribution ( fig .",
    "[ 5panel]e ) . the temperature drops and the molecular hydrogen fraction increases .",
    "it is here , at number densities of @xmath25 , that the high redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed . although the molecular mass fraction is not even 0.1% it is sufficient to cool the gas rapidly down to @xmath26 .",
    "the gas can not cool below this temperature because of the sharp decrease in the cooling rate below @xmath27 .    at redshift 19 ( fig .",
    "[ 5panel ] ) , there are only two mass scales ; however , as time passes the central density grows and eventually passes @xmath28 , at which point the ro - vibrational levels of  are populated at their equilibrium values and the cooling time becomes independent of density ( instead of inversely proportional to it ) .",
    "this reduced cooling efficiency leads to an increase in the temperature ( fig .  [",
    "5panel]d ) .",
    "as the temperature rises , the cooling rate again increases ( it is 1000 times higher at 800 k than at 200 k ) , and the inflow velocities slowly climb .    in order to better understand what happens next , we examine the stability of an isothermal gas sphere . the critical mass for gravitational collapse given an external pressure @xmath29 ( be mass hereafter ) is given by ebert ( ) and bonnor ( ) as : @xmath30 here @xmath29 is the external pressure and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 the gravitational constant , the boltzmann constant and the sound speed , respectively .",
    "we can estimate this critical mass locally if we set the external pressure to be the local pressure to find @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mean mass per particle in units of the proton mass . using an adiabatic index @xmath36",
    ", we plot the ratio of the enclosed gas mass to this modified be mass in figure  [ bemass ] .",
    "our modeling shows ( fig .",
    "[ bemass ] ) , that by the fourth considered output time , the central 100  exceeds the be mass at that radius , indicating unstable collapse . this is the third mass scale and corresponds to the second local minimum in the radial velocity curves ( fig .",
    "[ 5panel]e ) .",
    "the inflow velocity is @xmath37 is still subsonic .",
    "although this mass scale is unstable , it does not represent the smallest scale of collapse in our simulation .",
    "this is due to the increasing molecular hydrogen fraction .",
    "when the gas density becomes sufficiently large ( @xmath38 ) , three - body molecular hydrogen formation becomes important .",
    "this rapidly increases the molecular fraction ( fig .",
    "[ 5panel]c ) and hence the cooling rate .",
    "the increased cooling leads to lower temperatures and even stronger inflow and . at a mass scale of @xmath39 , not only is the gas nearly completely molecular , but the radial inflow has become supersonic ( fig .  [",
    "5panel]e ) .",
    "when the  mass fraction approaches unity , the increase in the cooling rate saturates , and the gas goes through a radiative shock .",
    "this marks the first appearance of the proto",
    " stellar accretion shock at a radius of about 20 astronomical units from its center .      when the cooling time becomes independent of density the classical criterion for fragmentation @xmath40 ( )",
    "can not be satisfied at high densities .",
    "however , in principal the medium may still be subject to thermal instability .",
    "the instability criterion is @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the cooling losses per second of a fluid parcel and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the gas temperature and mass density , respectively . at densities above the critical densities of molecular hydrogen the cooling time is independent of density , i.e. @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the high density cooling function ( e.g. ) .",
    "fitting the cooling function with a power - law locally around a temperature @xmath47 so that @xmath48 one finds @xmath49 . hence , under these circumstances the medium is thermally stable if @xmath50 . because , @xmath51 for the densities and temperatures of interest , we conclude that the medium is thermally stable .",
    "the above analysis neglects the heating from contraction , but this only strengthens the conclusion . if heating balances cooling one can neglect the @xmath52 term in equation  ( [ eq : ic ] ) and find the medium to be thermally stable for @xmath53 .",
    "[ bemass ]    however , here we neglected the chemical processes .",
    "the detailed analysis for the case when chemical processes occur on the collapse time  scale is well known ( ) . this can be applied to primordial star formation ( ) including the three ",
    "body formation of molecular hydrogen ( ) which drives a chemo  thermal instability .",
    "evaluating all the terms in this modified instability criterion ( , equation  36 ) one finds the simple result that for molecular mass fractions @xmath54 the medium is expected to be chemo  thermally unstable .",
    "these large molecular fractions illustrate that the strong density dependence of the three body   formation dominates the instability .",
    "examining the three dimensional temperature and  density field we clearly see this chemo  thermal instability at work .",
    "cooler regions have larger  fractions .",
    "however , no corresponding large density inhomogeneities are found and fragmentation does not occur .",
    "this happens because of the short sound crossing times in the collapsing core . when the  formation time  scale becomes shorter than the cooling time the instability originates . however , as long as the sound crossing time is much shorter than the chemical and cooling time scales the cooler parts are efficiently mixed with the warmer material .",
    "this holds in our simulation until the final output where for the first time the   formation time scale becomes shorter than the sound  crossing time .",
    "however , at this point the proto ",
    "stellar core is fully molecular and stable against the chemo  thermal instability .",
    "consequently no large density contrasts are formed .",
    "because at these high densities the optical depth of the cooling radiation becomes larger than unity the instability will be suppressed even further .",
    "interestingly , rotational support does not halt the collapse .",
    "this is for two reaons .",
    "the first is shown in panel a of fig .",
    "[ angtrans ] , which plots the specific angular momentum against enclosed mass for the same seven output times discussed earlier . concentrating on the first output ( fig .",
    "[ angtrans ] ) , we see that the central gas begins the collapse with a specific angular momentum only @xmath55% as large as the mean value .",
    "this type of angular momentum profile is typical of halos produced by gravitational collapse ( e.g. ) , and means that the protostellar gas starts out without much angular momentum to lose . as a graphic example of this , consider the central one solar mass of the collapsing region .",
    "it has only an order of magnitude less angular momentum at densities @xmath56 than it had at @xmath57 although it collapsed by over a factor 100 in radius .",
    "the remaining output times ( fig .",
    "[ angtrans ] ) indicate that there is some angular momentum transport within the central @xmath58 ( since l plotted as a function of enclosed mass should stay constant as long as there is no shell crossing ) . in panel c",
    ", we divide @xmath42 by @xmath59 to get a typical rotational velocity and in panels b and d compare this velocity to the keplerian rotational velocity and the local sound speed , respectively .",
    "we find that the typical rotational speed is a factor two to three below that required for rotational support .",
    "furthermore , we see that this azimuthal speed never significantly exceeds the sound speed , although for most the mass below @xmath58 it is comparable in value .",
    "we interpret this as evidence that it is shock waves during the turbulent collapse that are responsible for much of the transported angular momentum .",
    "a collapsing turbulent medium is different from a disk in keplarian rotation . at any radius",
    "there will be both low and high angular momentum material , and pressure forces or shock waves can redistribute the angular momentum between fluid elements .",
    "lower angular momentum material will selectively sink inwards , displacing higher angular momentum gas .",
    "this hydrodynamic transport of angular momentum will be suppressed in situation where the collapse proceeds on the dynamical time rather on the longer cooling time as in the presented case .",
    "this difference in cooling time and the widely different initial conditions may explain why this mechanism has not been observed in simulations of present day star formation ( e.g. , and references therein ) .",
    "however , such situations may also arise in the late stages of the formation of present day stars and in scenarios for the formation of super  massive black holes .",
    "to ensure that the angular momentum transport is not due to numerical shear viscosity ( ) we have carried out the resolution study discussed above .",
    "we have varied the effective spatial resolution by a factor 16 and found identical results .",
    "furthermore , we have run the adaptive mesh refinement code with two different implementations of the hydrodynamics solver .",
    "the resolution study and the results presented here were carried out with a direct piecewise parabolic method adopted for cosmology (; ) .",
    "we ran another simulation with the lower order zeus hydrodynamics ( ) and still found no relevant differences .",
    "these tests are not strict proof that the encountered angular momentum transport is not caused by numerical effects ; however , they are reassuring .",
    "the strength of magnetic fields generated around the epoch of recombination is minute .",
    "in contrast , phase transitions at the qantum  chromo",
    " dynamic ( qcd ) and electro  weak scales may form even dynamically important fields . while there is a plethora of such scenarios for primordial magnetic field generation in the early universe they are not considered to be an integral part of our standard picture of structure formation .",
    "this is because not even the order of these phase transitions is known ( ) , and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , strong primordial small - scale ( @xmath60 comoving ) magnetic fields are poorly constrained observationally ( ) .",
    "the critical magnetic field for support of a cloud ( ) allows a rough estimate up to which primordial magnetic field strengths we may expect our simulation results to hold . for this",
    "we also assume a flux frozen flow with no additional amplification of the magnetic field other than the contraction ( @xmath61 ) . for a comoving b field of @xmath62 on scales",
    "@xmath63 the critical field needed for support may be reached during the collapse possibly modifying the mass scales found in our purely hydrodynamic simulations . however , the ionized fraction drops rapidly during the collapse because of the absence of cosmic rays ionizations .",
    "consequently ambipolar diffusion should be much more effective in the formation of the first stars even if such strong primordial magnetic fields were present .",
    "previously we discussed the formation of the pre  galactic object and the primordial `` molecular cloud '' that hosts the formation of the first star in the simulated patch of the universe ( ) .",
    "these simulations had a dynamic range of @xmath64 and identified a @xmath0 core within the primordial `` molecular cloud '' undergoing renewed gravitational collapse .",
    "the fate of this core was unclear because there was the potential caveat that three body  formation could have caused fragmentation .",
    "indeed this further fragmentation had been suggest by analytic work ( ) and single zone models ( ) . the three dimensional simulations described here were designed to be able to test whether the three body process will lead to a break up of the core . _",
    "no fragmentation due to three body  formation is found .",
    "_ this is to a large part because of the slow quasi ",
    "hydrostatic contraction found in abn which allows sub  sonic damping of density perturbations and yields a smooth distribution at the time when three body  formation becomes important . instead of fragmentation a single fully molecular proto ",
    "star of @xmath65 is formed at the center of the @xmath66 core .",
    "however , even with extraordinary resolution , the _ final _ mass of the first star remains unclear .",
    "whether all the available cooled material of the surroundings will accrete onto the proto  star or feedback from the forming star will limit the further accretion and hence its own growth is difficult to compute in detail .    within @xmath67",
    "about @xmath68 may be accreted assuming that angular momentum will not slow the collapse ( fig .",
    "[ acrete ] ) .",
    "the maximum of the accretion time of @xmath69 is at @xmath70 .",
    "however , stars larger than @xmath71 will explode within @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely ( even in the absence of angular momentum ) that there would be sufficient time to accrete such large masses .    a one solar mass proto ",
    "star will evolve too slowly to halt substantial accretion . from the accretion time profile ( fig .",
    "[ acrete ] ) one may argue that a more realistic minimum mass limit of the first star should be @xmath73 because this amount would be accreted within a few thousand years .",
    "this is a very short time compared to expected proto  stellar evolution times .",
    "however , some properties of the primordial gas may make it easier to halt the accretion .",
    "one possibility is the destruction of the cooling agent , molecular hydrogen , without which the acreting material may reach hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this may or may not be sufficient to halt the accretion .",
    "one may also imagine that the central material heats up to @xmath74 k , allowing lyman-@xmath75 cooling from neutral hydrogen .",
    "that cooling region may expand rapidly as the internal pressure drops because of infall , possibly allowing the envelope to accrete even without molecular hydrogen as cooling agent .",
    "additionally , radiation pressure from ionizing photons as well as atomic hydrogen lyman series photons may become significant and eventually reverse the flow .",
    "the mechanisms discussed by haehnelt ( 1993 ) on galactic scales will play an important role for the continued accretion onto the proto  star .",
    "this is an interplay of many complex physical processes because one has a hot ionized strmgren sphere through which cool and dense material is trying to accrete .",
    "in such a situation one expects a raleigh  taylor type instability that is modified via the geometry of the radiation field .    at the final output time",
    "presented here there are @xmath76 hydrogen molecules in the entire protogalaxy . also the  formation time scale is long because there are no dust grains and the free electrons ( needed as a catalyst ) have almost fully recombined .",
    "hence , as soon as the the first uv photons of lyman werner band frequencies are produced there will be a rapidly expanding photo  dissociating region ( pdr ) inhibiting further cooling within it .",
    "this photo - dissociation will prevent further fragmentation at the molecular cloud scale .",
    "i.e. no other star can be formed within the same halo before the first star dies in a supernova .",
    "the latter , however , may have sufficient energy to unbind the entire gas content of the small pre  galactic object it formed in ( ) .",
    "this may have interesting feedback consequences for the dispersal of metals , entropy and magnetic field into the intergalactic medium ( , )",
    ".    smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph , e.g. ) , used extensively in cosmological hydrodynamics , has been employed ( ) to follow the collapse of solid body rotating uniform spheres .",
    "the assumption of coherent rotation causes these clouds to collapse into a disk which developes filamentary structures which eventually fragment to form dense clumps of masses between @xmath77 and @xmath78 solar masses .",
    "it has been argued that these clumps will continue to accrete and merge and eventually form very massive stars .",
    "these sph simulation have unrealistic initial conditions and much less resolution then our calculations .",
    "however , they also show that many details of the collapse forming a primordial star are determined by the properties of the hydrogen molecule .",
    "we have also simulated different initial density fields for a lambda cdm cosmology .",
    "there we have focused on halos with different clustering environments .",
    "although we have not followed the collapse in these halos to proto - stellar densities , we have found no qualitative differences in the `` primordial molecular cloud '' formation process as discussed in abn . also other amr simulations ( )",
    "give consistent results on scales larger than @xmath79 .",
    "in all cases a cooling flow forms the primordial molecular cloud at the center of the dark matter halo . we conclude that the molecular cloud formation process seems to be independent of the halo clustering properties and the adopted cdm type cosmology .",
    "also the mass scales for the core and the proto  star are determined by the local bonnor ",
    "ebert mass .",
    "consequently , we expect the key results discussed here to be insensitive to variations in cosmology or halo clustering .",
    "the picture arising from these numerical simulations has some very interesting implications .",
    "it is possible that all metal free stars are massive and form in isolation .",
    "their supernovae may provide the metals seen in even the lowest column density quasar absorption lines ( , and references therein ) .",
    "massive primordial stars offer a natural explanation for the absence of purely metal free low mass stars in the milky way .",
    "the consequences for the formation of galaxies may be even more profound in that the supernovae provide metals , entropy , and magnetic fields and may even alter the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations of the baryons .",
    "interestingly , it has been recently argued , from abundance patterns , that in low metallicity galactic halo stars seem to have been enriched by only one population of massive stars ( ) .",
    "these results , if confirmed , would represent strong support for the picture arising from our ab initio simulations of first structure formation .    to end on a speculative note",
    "there is suggestive evidence that links gamma ray bursts to sites of massive star formation ( e.g. ) .",
    "it would be very fortunate if a significant fraction of the massive stars naturally formed in the simulations would cause gamma ray bursts ( e.g. ) .",
    "such high redshift bursts would open a remarkably bright window for the study of the otherwise dark ( faint ) ages .    1 .   [ pd68 ] peebles , p.  j.  e.  & dicke , r.  h.  1968 , apj * 154 * , 891 2 .",

    "<S> the protostar is acreting material very rapidly ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> radiative feedback from the star will not only halt its growth but also inhibit the formation of other stars in the same pre  galactic object ( at least until the first star ends its life , presumably as a supernova ) . </S>",
