    "<S> we investigate the infrared properties of su(@xmath0)@xmath1 conformal field theory perturbed by its adjoint primary field in 1 + 1 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the latter field theory is shown to govern the low - energy properties of various su(@xmath0 ) spin chain problems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , using a mapping onto @xmath2-leg su(@xmath0 ) spin ladder , a massless renormalization group flow to su(@xmath0)@xmath3 criticality is predicted when @xmath0 and @xmath2 have no common divisor . </S>",
    "<S> the latter result extends the well - known massless flow between su(2)@xmath1 and su(2)@xmath3 wess - zumino - novikov - witten theories when @xmath2 is odd in connection to the haldane s conjecture on su(2 ) heisenberg spin chains . </S>",
    "<S> a direct approach is presented in the simplest @xmath4 and @xmath5 case to investigate the existence of this massless flow . </S>"
