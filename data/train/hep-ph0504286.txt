    "equivalently , we can choose @xmath129 as the independent parameters .",
    "two of these six parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath130 , contribute to the gauge boson masses .",
    "when turning off the couplings between the doublet and the triplet in the scalar potential , @xmath131 , the triplet could still acquire a vev , @xmath132 , provided that @xmath133 is negative . since we have not observed any light scalar experimentally up to the ew scale , the triplet mass which is roughly of order @xmath134 has to be at least of the ew scale , @xmath135 .",
    "this is problematic because the vev of a real triplet only contributes to @xmath98 but not to @xmath31 , which then results in a contribution of order @xmath136 to the @xmath137 parameter , due to the relation , @xmath138 .",
    "for @xmath134 greater than @xmath18 , the ew symmetry is broken at a high scale . in order to avoid these problems ,",
    "the parameter @xmath133 thus has to be positive so that the triplet does not acquire a vev via this mass term when @xmath139 is turned off .",
    "once the coupling @xmath140 is turned on while keeping @xmath141 , the term @xmath142 effectively plays the role of the mass term for @xmath63 and for @xmath143 .",
    "thus , similar to the reasoning given above , for @xmath144 , the coupling @xmath140 has to be positive so that it does not induce a large triplet vev . for simplicity , consider the case when there is no mixing in the neutral higgs sector , @xmath145 . in this case , when the mixing in the charged sector approaches zero , @xmath146 , the masses @xmath76 and @xmath77 approach infinity , and their difference @xmath147 approaches zero .",
    "the contribution due to the new scalars thus vanishes , and only the lightest neutral higgs contributes to @xmath95 . even though the contribution due to the new scalars vanishes , @xmath95 does not approach @xmath24 .",
    "this is because in the tm case , four input parameters are needed , while in the sm case three inputs are needed .",
    "there is no continuous limit that takes one case to the other@xcite .",
    "one way to achieve the @xmath146 limit is to take the mass parameter @xmath148 while keeping the parameter @xmath139 finite .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) then dictates that @xmath149 .",
    "however , satisfying eq .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) requires that @xmath150 .",
    "as @xmath151 , this condition implies that the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath140 has to scale as @xmath152 , which approaches infinity as @xmath146 .",
    "this can also be seen from eq .",
    "( [ neutralmix1 ] ) .",
    "as there is no mixing in the neutral sector , @xmath153 the condition @xmath154 then follows .",
    "so , in the absence of the neutral mixing , @xmath145 , in order to take the charged mixing angle @xmath71 to zero while holding @xmath139 fixed , one has to take @xmath140 to infinity .",
    "in other words , for the triplet to decouple requires a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath140 to become strong , leading to the breakdown of the perturbation theory .",
    "alternatively , the neutral mixing angle @xmath69 can approach zero by taking @xmath155 while keeping @xmath140 and @xmath139 fixed . in this case , the minimization condition , @xmath156 where @xmath157 , implies that the charged mixing angle @xmath71 has to approach zero .",
    "this again corresponds to the case where the custodial symmetry is restored , by which we mean that the triplet vev vanishes , @xmath158 . in this case , severe fine - tuning is needed in order to satisfied the condition given in eq .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "another way to get @xmath146 is to have @xmath159 , which trivially satisfies eq .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "this can also be seen from eq .",
    "[ chargemix2 ] , @xmath160 eq .  ( [ cond2 ] ) then gives @xmath161 .",
    "so for small @xmath140 , the masses of these additional scalar fields are of the weak scale , @xmath162 .",
    "this corresponds to a case when the custodial symmetry is restored .",
    "so unless one imposes by hand such symmetry to forbid @xmath139 , four input parameters are always needed in the renormalization . if there is a symmetry which makes @xmath163 ( to all orders ) , say , @xmath164 , then there are only three input parameters needed .",

    "[ fg : mwmh ] shows the prediction for @xmath98 as a function of @xmath75 for various values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for small @xmath147 , the lightest neutral higgs boson mass can range from @xmath193 gev to a tev and still satisfy the experimental prediction for @xmath98",
    "this agrees with our conclusion in sec .",
    "[ higgstrip ] that to minimize the scalar contribution to @xmath95 , the mass splitting @xmath147 has to be small and that when the mass splitting is small , cancellations can occur between the contributions of the lightest neutral higgs and those of the additional scalar fields .",
    "this has new important implications for the higgs searches .",
    "we have considered the top quark contribution to muon decay at one loop in the sm and in two models with @xmath0 at tree level : the sm with an addition real scalar triplet and the minimal left - right model . in these new models , because the @xmath137 parameter is no longer equal to one at the tree level , a fourth input parameter is required in a consistent renormalization scheme .",
    "these models illustrate a general feature that the @xmath49 dependence in the radiative corrections @xmath95 becomes logarithmic , contrary to the case of the sm where @xmath24 depends on @xmath4 quadratically .",
    "one therefore loses the prediction for @xmath49 from radiative corrections . on the other hand , due to cancellations between the contributions to the radiative corrections from the sm higgs and the triplet ,",
    "a higgs mass @xmath75 as large as a few tev is allowed by the @xmath3 mass measurement .",
    "we emphasize that by taking the triplet mass to infinity , one does not recover the sm .",
    "this is due to the fact that the triplet scalar field is non - decoupling , and it implies that the one - loop electroweak results can not be split into a sm contribution plus a piece which vanishes as the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the weak scale .",
    "this fact has been overlooked by most analyses in the littlest higgs model@xcite , and correctly including the effects of the triplet can dramatically change the conclusion on the viability of the model@xcite . such non - decoupling effect has been pointed out in the two higgs doublet model@xcite , left - right symmetric model@xcite , and the littlest higgs model@xcite .",
    "it has _ not _ been discussed before in the model with a triplet .",
    "we comment that the non - decoupling observed in these examples do not contradict with the common knowledge that in gut models heavy scalars decouple .",
    "these two cases are fundamentally different because in gut models , heavy scalar fields do not acquire vev that break the ew symmetry , while in cases where non - decoupling is observed , heavy scalar fields _ do _ acquire vev that breaks the ew symmetry . the quadratic dependence in scalar masses in the triplet model can be easily understood physically . in sm with only the higgs doublet present , the quadratic scalar mass contribution is protected by the tree level custodial symmetry , and thus the higgs mass contribution is logarithmic at one - loop .",
    "this is the well - known screening theorem by veltman@xcite .",
    "as the custodial symmetry is broken in the sm at one - loop due to the mass splitting between the top and bottom quarks , the two - loop higgs contribution is quadratic . in models with a triplet higgs ,",
    "as the custodial symmetry is broken already at the tree level , there is no screening theorem that protects the quadratic scalar mass dependence from appearing .",
