    "this report summarizes some of the most recent measurements obtained from analyzing inclusive dis data ( section  [ dis ] ) as well as some new hera results in jet physics ( section  [ jets ] ) . in addition , section  [ searches ] is dedicated to the search for new phenomena presenting the unexpected observations of events with a high-@xmath9 isolated lepton and missing transverse momentum and of multi - electron topologies .",
