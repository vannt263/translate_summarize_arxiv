    "a complete knowledge of @xmath0 is equivalent to a complete physical characterization of the fractal.@xcite    metal - insulator transitions ( mit s ) depend on the dimensionality and symmetries of the system and can occur in both the strong disorder and the weak disorder regime ( strong - coupling or weak - coupling regime , respectively , of the corresponding field - theoretical description ) .",

    "the corresponding hamiltonian , which describes a disordered 1d sample with random long - range hopping , is represented by real symmetric matrices , whose entries are randomly drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean , @xmath31 , and a variance which depends on the distance between the lattice sites , @xmath32 where the parameter @xmath6 plays the role of the inverse coupling constant @xmath33 of the corresponding @xmath9 model at the center of the spectral band . the model describes a whole family of critical theories parametrized by @xmath34 , which determines the critical dimensionless conductance , in the same way as the dimensionality labels the different anderson transitions . in the two limiting cases @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which correspond to the weak and the strong disorder limits , respectively , some critical properties have been derived analytically .",
