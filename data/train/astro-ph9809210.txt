    "the characterization of the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) remains a high priority as a means to better understand both the formation of globular clusters and the buildup of galaxies .",
    "the differences in the breadth and peak position of gclfs in late - type galaxies in the local group and early - type galaxies in other clusters has been known for some time ( harris et al . 1991 ) .",
    "efforts to use gclfs as distance indicators or tracers of galaxy mergers would clearly benefit from more complete coverage over luminosity and galaxy type . with its 01 resolution , low sky background , and consequent ability to distinguish very faint point - sources , the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) is an ideal platform from which to carry out such a study .",
    "the first surveys of globular clusters in the fornax cluster were carried out photographically ( dawe & dickens 1976 ; hanes & harris 1986 ; harris & hanes 1987 ) .",
    "later ccd studies ( see ashman & zepf 1997 for a list of references ) detected bimodal color distributions ( zepf & ashman 1993 ) and color gradients ( ostrov , geisler , & forte 1993 ) in the cluster system of ngc 1399 .",
    "_ hst _ studies have now confirmed the existence of multi - modal color distributions in several other giant ellipticals ( e.g. m 87 , elson & santiago 1996b ; whitmore et al .",
    "1995 ; ngc 5846 , forbes et al .",
    "what follows is the first systematic _ hst _ investigation of the globular cluster systems in the fornax cluster .",
    "the results should help us to understand how cd galaxies and their large associated globular cluster populations formed ( ashman & zepf 1992 ; forbes , brodie , & grillmair 1997b ) .",
    "one aim of this study is to search for variations in the gc populations among a sample of early - type galaxies in the same cluster . in this paper",
    "we examine the globular cluster populations of ngc 1399 , ngc 1404 , and ngc 1316 . in companion papers we study the metallicity and spatial distributions of globular clusters in ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 ( forbes et al .",
    "1998 ) and examine the globular cluster system of the lower luminosity elliptical ngc 1379 ( elson et al . 1998 ) .",
    "ngc 1399 is the cd elliptical at the center of the fornax cluster and , like m 87 , has an extraordinarily large number of globular clusters for its luminosity ( see references in ashman & zepf 1997 ) .",
    "ngc 1404 is an e1 elliptical about half a magnitude fainter and lying only 10 arcminutes from ngc 1399 in projection .",
    "attempts to study its globular cluster system ( hanes & harris 1986 ; richtler et al .",
    "1992 ) have been complicated by its location within the extended envelope of ngc 1399 .",
    "ngc 1316 is another giant elliptical in the fornax cluster , more than a magnitude brighter than ngc 1399 , with a double - lobed radio source ( fornax a ) , an x - ray halo , and dust and other irregularities ( schweizer 1980 ) indicating a recent merger .",
    "ngc 1316 is situated more than three degrees away from ngc 1399 , clearly dominating its corner of the fornax cluster , and has been the subject of a recent wfpc1 study by shaya et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "if the high specific frequency of globular clusters around ngc 1399 is to be attributed to tidal stripping or accretion of existing globular clusters in other cluster galaxies ( which would be consistent with the kinematic data of grillmair et al .",
    "1994a and kissler - patig et al .",
    "1997b ) , we might expect mean gc metallicities to be very similar to those of other cluster galaxies .",
    "alternatively , if much of ngc 1399 s globular cluster system formed more recently from enriched gas , its globulars may be overly metal - rich compared to other galaxies of the same magnitude . if new globular clusters are formed in the normal course of mergers ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) , then we might expect to see a a number of young , metal - rich globulars surrounding ngc 1316 .",

    "this corresponds approximately to integer pixel shifts in both the pc ( 00455 pix@xmath3 ) and the wf chips ( 00996 pix@xmath3 ) ( the actual shifts are generally within 0.1 pixels of integer values ) . aligning and median - combining the images consequently allowed us to eliminate the majority of cosmic rays and hot pixels at the same time . to prevent as much as possible the contamination of the faint end of the gclf , known warm / hot pixels , charge traps , and bad columns were flagged and subsequently ignored in the median procedure .",
    "the distribution of unflagged pixels was further tested for the presence of cosmic ray events before computing the median value from the remaining pixels .",
    "the results were found to be cleaner both statistically and visually when compared with the results of such standard cosmic - ray removal procedures as are available , for example , within stsdas / iraf .",
    "the pc images of the sample galaxies were analyzed using the vista surface - brightness profile - fitting routine snuc , which fits logarithmically - spaced , concentric ellipses to unmasked portions of the galaxy profile .",
    "the resulting model profiles were then subtracted from each image in an effort to flatten the background as much as possible . for the wf chips ,",
    "similar model surface brightness distributions were generated using both large - scale window - medianing , and convolution with a two - dimensional gaussian having @xmath8 .",
    "luminosity fluctuations in f0336 and f0338 were found to be on scales sufficiently large that model subtraction was deemed unnecessary .",
    "source detection and aperture photometry were carried out using daophot ii ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "owing to the high resolution inherent in these images , overlap of sources was negligible and aperture photometry yielded a slightly narrower color distribution than could be obtained using psf - fitting photometry .",
    "the detection threshold was fixed at three times the rms expected _ locally _ from photon statistics and readout noise , the former computed by taking into account the subtracted model surface - brightness distributions . given the degree of undersampling inherent to the wfpc2 detectors , a @xmath9 detection threshold predictably yielded a substantial number of spurious detections .",
    "however , the final photometry table was generated using only those sources which were detected in both passbands and having colors in the range @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , the number of spurious detections remaining in the final sample ( as determined by visual inspection ) was found to be negligible .",
    "ngc 1316 is something of a special case in our sample owing to the presence of large amounts of dust obscuration . for this galaxy",
    ", we masked large areas of the wfpc2 field of view in which there was visible evidence of dust in f450w .",
    "the extent of the dust and the regions we chose to exclude from analysis are shown in figure [ fig : plate2 ] .",
    "the `` unobscured '' detections attributed to ngc 1316 thus come from approximately the outer halves of each of the wf chips ; detections in the pc are not considered in the subsequent analysis owing to the strong likelihood that all detections are obscured and reddened to a significant extent .",
    "faint background galaxies and bright foreground stars often produced multiple detections along spiral arms or diffraction spikes , and several small regions of each image were masked accordingly .",
    "in addition , we disregarded all detections with @xmath11 ( the difference in magnitude computed for apertures of radius 1 and 2 pixels , respectively ) @xmath12 magnitudes ( @xmath13 magnitudes for the pc ) .",
    "visual examination showed that this effectively removed almost all obvious faint galaxies from the sample .",
    "a more extensive discussion of the contamination issue is presented by elson et al .",

    "typical globular clusters are marginally resolved by wfpc2 . treating them as point sources from the standpoint of photometry would therefore underestimate to varying degrees their total luminosities ( see holtzman et al .",
    "1996 for a discussion of this problem ) . to estimate this shortfall",
    ", we convolved an array of king models ( king 1966 ) with wfpc2 psfs generated using tiny tim ( krist 1995 ) for each globular s position on the detector .",
    "we then sampled these models using wfpc2-sized pixels and a @xmath16 grid of pixel - centerings .",
    "each model realization was then compared on a pixel - by - pixel basis with the real data in the ngc 1399 images for @xmath17 pixels to compute @xmath18 .    while this procedure yielded a range of best - fit core radii not unlike that found in galactic globular clusters , it failed sufficiently often that we do not regard the computed core radii as reliable .",
    "the reasons for this may include the fact that we did not take into account image dithering and subsequent integer - pixel shifting used to combat hot pixels , as well as inaccuracies in the tiny tim model psfs .",
    "however , aperture corrections derived from king model fits with acceptable values of @xmath18 agreed very well with those determined empirically for the brightest , most isolated clusters in the field .",
    "we therefore adopted mean 05 aperture corrections to our 2-pixel - radius measurements determined directly from the images in each frame , ranging from @xmath19 magnitudes for the wf chips to @xmath20 magnitudes for the pc . based on our simulations ,",
    "the use of mean aperture corrections applied to all clusters in a given wf chip is likely to introduce a random error of @xmath21 magnitudes to the photometry of any individual cluster . to convert to @xmath22 and @xmath23 magnitudes we used the gain ratios and zeropoints given by holtzman et al .",

    "the higher surface density of globular clusters around ngc 1404 , as well as the difference in mean colors when compared with a similar field on the opposite side of ngc 1399 ( f0338 ) , indicate that these globular clusters indeed belong to ngc 1404 as opposed to the much more populous and extended population of ngc 1399 .",

    "it seems unlikely that significant recent star formation has taken place at these large radii , and that we must therefore be looking primarily at old stars .",
    "thus , even if there is substantial fading of a younger stellar population residing at the center of ngc 1316 , the total magnitude ( and therefore @xmath98 ) will be largely unaffected .",

    "1997a ) . in the wf frames only , we find 517 , 74 , and 48 objects with @xmath105 in fields n1399 , f0338 , and f0336 , respectively .",
    "the radial surface density distributions of globular clusters in cd galaxies generally have a fairly extended  core \" ( grillmair et al .",
    "1986 ; lauer & kormendy 1986 ; grillmair et al .",
    "1994b ) where the surface density becomes nearly constant .",
    "if we thus ignore our central pointing and assume that in the outer parts the surface density falls off as @xmath106 , then solving    @xmath107    for @xmath108 and using only the outer fields at 0.14 and 1.4 degrees , we find @xmath109 arcmin@xmath110 . thus the surface density of unresolved objects ( 10.6 arcmin@xmath110 ) at 14 from ngc 1399 would be entirely consistent with a roughly constant surface density of compact background galaxies .",
    "put another way , under the assumption that the globular cluster surface density profile maintains a power - law form with @xmath108 at all radii , we would predict only @xmath111 globular clusters in our outermost field .",
    "[ as an aside , this powerlaw would predict @xmath112 globular clusters in our ngc 1399 field , or about 60% more than we actually see , which is consistent with the degree of core - flattening in the surface density distribution found by kissler - patig et al .",

    "if we adopt the flatter slope with @xmath113 found by forbes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we would predict @xmath114 globular clusters in our outermost field . clearly , the data are consistent with no intergalactic globular clusters at 14 , but are insufficient to rule them out .    despite the relatively large color / metallicity spread in ngc 1399 s globular cluster system , figure [ fig : cm ]",
    "demonstrates how well defined their distribution is over color and magnitude compared to the background field .",
    "indeed , one could draw a box with @xmath115 and @xmath116 and capture more than 95% of the cluster sample .",
    "if we then place such a box over the color - magnitude distribution of objects in f0336 , we find a total of 7 objects crowding the very faint end of the box .",
    "close visual inspection of these objects reveals that two of the seven objects are probably galaxies , but we can not rule out that the remaining five objects may be globular clusters in the envelope of ngc 1399 .",
    "however , if this is so , then the color - magnitude distribution of these outlying clusters must be very different from those near the center of the galaxy ; the odds of obtaining the observed color - magnitude distribution by sampling the gclf in figure [ fig : lf ] are vanishingly small .",
    "we have analyzed wfpc2 images of three early - type galaxies and two background fields in the fornax cluster . from an investigation of the global distribution over color and magnitude , we conclude the following :    * the color distributions of globular clusters in the central regions of ngc 1399 and its nearby neighbor ngc 1404 are bimodal , and statistically very similar to one another . * with respect to the color distributions seen in ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 ,",

    "( 1993 ) in ngc 1399 appears to be present even among the faintest clusters . *",
    "the luminosity functions of globular clusters in ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 are essentially identical to one another and very similar to the luminosity function of globulars in m 87 . * the luminosity function for the blue globulars in ngc 1399 peaks @xmath82 magnitudes brighter in @xmath22 than the luminosity function of the red clusters . *",
    "the luminosity function of objects surrounding ngc 1316 is unlike that found for globular clusters in the other galaxies .",
    "based on the bluer color distribution , the exponential shape of the luminosity function , and the relatively large spread in cluster sizes , we tentatively identify these objects with an extensive population of old _ open _ clusters . * the measured peak of ngc 1399 s luminosity function ( converted to @xmath65-band magnitudes ) is 0.01 @xmath69 0.1 magnitudes fainter than that of m 87 , yielding @xmath117 = 82 @xmath69 8 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , where the uncertainty reflects only the effects of random errors .",
