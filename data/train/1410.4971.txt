    "a fundamental question in the study of star formation is the mass spectrum of stars produced in young star clusters  the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the imf encodes the physics from the star formation process , sets the initial conditions for stellar population modeling , and thus informs models of galactic evolution .",
    "empirical imfs serve as crucial touchstones for many aspects of stellar and galactic astrophysics .",
    "the origin of the imf and its dependence on environmental factors remains an active area of research @xcite .",
    "substellar objects specifically may provide crucial insight into the imf as a whole .",
    "consensus is emerging that objects below the deuterium burning limit ( @xmath4 , @xcite ) can form by the same process as their stellar counterparts @xcite . in this unified picture of star formation",
    ", the formation of low mass objects requires non - linear density fluctuations generated by turbulence .",
    "two other prominent theories for brown dwarf formation are ejection from their gas reservoir due to three - body interactions , and disk fragmentation around a more massive star due to gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "current observational evidence  relatively massive brown dwarf disks @xcite , the continuity of the imf across the substellar boundary , the discovery of a young brown dwarf binary and a pre - brown dwarf in isolation ( @xcite , as well as the orbital properties of close binaries @xcite  seems to favor a unified turbulent fragmentation theory . in the turbulent fragmentation paradigm , turbulence and self - gravity generate a range of density perturbations , which in conjunction with sub fragmentation , produce the full range of stellar masses . because the brown dwarfs sample the tail of the distribution , it is possible that their abundance is more sensitive to changes in environment than the imf as a whole .",
    "indeed there is some evidence for different populations of low mass objects from cluster to cluster @xcite , whereas the evidence for a varying imf in the milky way is absent ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . as we show in this paper , some of this variation might be due to chromospheric activity contaminating mass determination at the sub - stellar boundary .",
    "in contrast , massive elliptical galaxies do show evidence for a bottom heavy imf @xcite , however it is unlikely that a change in the brown - dwarf - to - star ratio would be detectable given the uncertainties in the overall mass - to - light ratio .",
    "a first step towards understanding the origins of possible imf variations is a robust calculation of young cluster imfs . determining the masses of objects near the substellar boundary in these regions is crucial because it provides a direct probe of the star formation process .",
    "more importantly , young clusters allow us to probe further down the mass function because substellar objects are still relatively bright at young ages . empirically determining the imfs of young clusters",
    "is usually done in one of two ways : one can estimate the luminosity function and then convert to a mass function using a theoretical m ",
    "l relationship ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or one can estimate the masses of the individual stars in the cluster by comparing their position in the h - r diagram with a theoretical isochrone , and then build up the aggregate imf from those individual masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter case",
    ", the masses can be estimated from effective temperatures ( ) or bolometric luminosities ( ) or a combination of the two .",
    "the distribution of stellar masses is usually found to peak between 0.10.5 . in recent years",
    ", the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs in individual clusters has frequently been used as a simple , quantitative metric to parameterize the imf in the low - mass regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , specifically suited to test the various proposed formation scenarios for brown dwarfs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "importantly , stellar masses inferred from  measurements can be significantly underestimated if the effects of magnetic activity are not taken into account .",
    "there is emerging consensus in the literature that magnetic activity inflates the radii and suppresses the temperatures of low - mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "an active star will present a lower  than expected for its mass ; the stellar mass inferred from that lower  will in turn be lower than the true mass . in @xcite , we used mass , radius , and measurements for a benchmark sample of active field dwarfs and eclipsing binaries to derive empirical relationships between the strength of magnetic activity ( as measured by the strength of the  chromospheric emission ) and the degree of radius inflation and  suppression .",
    "we found , for example , that a low - mass star near the h - burning limit at an age of a few myr with an -to - bolometric luminosity ratio of @xmath5 /  @xmath6 ( i.e. , near the chromospheric  saturation \" value of @xmath7 ) will have its  decreased by @xmath27% ( or @xmath0200  k ) , and thus its -inferred mass will be a factor of @xmath02 lower than the true mass ( cf .",

    "we use upper sco as our first test region for this experiment .",
    "being young ( 510 myr , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the region is amenable to a study of activity s effects on the inferred masses of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs at an age where they are still likely to be magnetically active while no longer being strongly contaminated by signatures of disk accretion .",

    "the observational determination of imfs is notoriously complicated by potential observational biases and systematic effects due to , e.g. , sample completeness and contamination , differential reddening , mass segregation , unresolved binarity , etc .",
    "these issues are beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "our sample of young , low - mass stars is taken from the study of the young ( @xmath0510 myr ) upper sco star - forming region of @xcite .",

    "the mass function presented in their paper does not turn over until below 0.05  , suggesting a possible overabundance of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs in upper sco compared with other regions .",
    "the @xcite sample is ideal for our purposes because ( a ) the low - mass population of the region was characterized with reportedly good completeness from @xmath00.2  to well below the nominal h - burning limit of @xmath00.08 ( i.e. , the imf is well sampled near the expected peak of the stellar mass distribution and below , ( b ) the stars are young enough to be highly magnetically active but old enough that the fraction of stars with massive disks and high accretion rates is relatively low , and ( c ) the @xcite analysis included -inferred stellar masses and reported measurements of the  emission for all of the sources .    to measure the strength of chromospheric activity , we take the  equivalent widths ( ews ) reported by @xcite and convert these to /  in the same manner as described in @xcite . in short ,",
    "we scale the ews to  luminosities by multiplying with continuum fluxes at the wavelength of h@xmath1 taken from the ames - dusty models @xcite for low - gravity , solar metallicity objects (  @xmath8 ) with  from 2400 to 4000k .",

    "note that the removed set ( red points and filled points in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] ) is larger than ( but inclusive of ) the set identified as accretors by @xcite because here we have conservatively also flagged objects that show clear signatures of massive disks from the _ wise _ infrared data that were not available at the time of the @xcite study .",
    "this allows for the possibility of objects that may not have been observed to be actively accreting at the epoch when the  spectra were obtained but that may be affected by accretion at other times nonetheless .",
    "note also that our removal of the reddest objects in the _ wise _ passbands does not imply removal of the lowest mass objects , as the _ wise _ colors are primarily probing the presence of circumstellar disks , not the photospheric .",
    "we have checked that the removed set does not represent a distinct region of the imf ; a two - sided k - s test of the masses of the removed set versus the masses of the retained set gives a probability of 32% that they are drawn from the same parent sample .      to ascertain the effect of the observed activity on the inferred masses of the sample stars",

    "however , the masses inferred from the  and @xmath11 certainly do depend on the choice of models , hence our use here of the same models originally adopted by @xcite in order to compare the adjusted masses to the originally reported ones .",
    "finally , to ensure an accurate comparison between the adjusted masses determined here and the masses originally inferred by @xcite , we checked that we were able to reproduce the original masses from @xcite using their originally reported   and @xmath11 . in all cases we reproduced their originally reported masses to within 1% , implying that we are effectively adopting the same interpolation method on the dm97 evolutionary tracks .",

    "visually , the original imf from @xcite appears to be shifted to systematically lower masses , as expected since the activity corrections act systematically to adjust the  to higher values corresponding to higher masses . considering the sample on an object - by - object basis , the smallest change in mass in 3% while the largest change in mass is 102% .    .",

    "the vertical line in each panel denotes the nominal brown - dwarf mass limit of 0.08 .",
    "the ratio of bds to stars is lower in the activity - corrected imfs at very high statistical significance ( see text ) .",
    "[ fig : imf ] ]    if we quantify the shift in the overall sample by comparing the modal values of the distributions in fig .",

    "the activity corrected modal mass is consistently higher than the uncorrected modal mass , and the difference is in all cases statistically significant at @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , a wilcoxon rank - sum test yields a probability of @xmath23 in all cases for the null hypothesis of no difference in the sample medians before and after application of the activity correction .    however , the intrinsic breadth of the imf may make shifts in the imf peak difficult to quantify with the modal value ; indeed , the imf appears to be broadly  flat \" in the vicinity of the peak ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and see fig .  [",

    "the bd - to - star ratio for the uncorrected distribution is @xmath28 .",
    "the uncertainties in the above ratios are based on simple poisson errors based on the numbers of objects in the sample above and below 0.08 . by this simple statistical treatment ,",
    "the activity - corrected and uncorrected imfs differ in their bd - to - star ratios at the level of @xmath03@xmath17 . however ,",
    "using a proper statistical test for differences in two sample proportions @xcite , we find a probability of @xmath29 in all cases for the null hypothesis that the proportions are the same before and after application of the activity correction .",
    "in our earlier work @xcite , we discussed the fact that we saw no obvious discontinuity in our  suppression relations at the fully convective mass boundary ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "indeed , our empirical correction seemed to solve the  reversal problem for the fully convective , young brown dwarf eclipsing binary 2m0535@xmath1205 .",
    "our study sample in this current work comprises low mass stars and brown dwarfs that have likely not begun hydrogen fusion yet , e.g. , @xcite shows that the core temperature of a 0.2  star does not reach the critical value of @xmath31k until @xmath211myr . in that sense , these young stars are more like the brown dwarf eclipsing binary than field stars of similar temperature .",
    "one key feature of  suppression in field stars is that  does not change with activity because the energy output is purely set by fusion reaction rate in the core . given that we do not yet fully understand the mechanism behind  suppression , it is possible that the empirical relation derived in the field would not apply to pre  main - sequence stars of similar .",
    "our correction may resolve an issue raised by the analysis in @xcite .",
    "their results suggest that upper sco  contains relatively higher numbers of very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs compared with other star forming regions . \"",
    "the slope of the low - mass imf derived by @xcite is higher than usual ( @xmath32 compared with @xmath33 in most other regions , @xcite ) . while the mass distribution begins to turn over around 0.1  in other regions , @xcite report a secondary peak at 0.05 .",
    "all this would indicate an overabundance of substellar objects in upper sco , which is not confirmed by other groups @xcite .",
    "@xcite speculate that this overabundance may be related to the presence of ob stars in upper sco .",
    "we have shown above that after applying the correction , the peak of the mass function shifts to 0.1  or higher , and the secondary peak disappears .",
    "the star - to - brown - dwarf ratio increases as well , and is now consistent with values for other regions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , which have been derived without using .",
    "thus , after taking into account the effect of magnetic activity on the estimated masses , the low - mass imf in upper sco no longer appears abnormal .",
    "our current work has not accounted for possible contamination by unresolved binary stars , however we expect these to have a minimal impact on our correction for the mass - radius anomaly",
    ". generically , unidentified binaries can confuse determination of stellar properties because of mismatches between luminosity , effective temperature and .",
    "close , tidally interacting binaries are also known to persist as chromospherically active and to show enhanced  emission .",
    "however , stars in this mass regime have a lower total binary fraction than higher mass stars , closer to 30% @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the parameter space in which to  hide \" a companion is small .",
    "companions close enough to induce activity are statistically biased towards more equal masses , making them likely to show up as double lined , spectroscopic binaries @xcite . for wider systems , nearly equal mass binaries  the easiest to detect  produce the most severe errors in determining stellar properites : these systems would show higher luminosities at a given .",
    "thus one would infer a larger radius , but not an unusually high /.",
    "these systems would only degrade the correlation we identify here .",
    "we have demonstrated that the mass distribution in the very low mass regime is significantly altered by the effects of magnetic activity .",
    "if masses are estimated from they can be systematically underestimated , which would influence the derived imf and especially the star - to - brown - dwarf ratio .",
    "when masses are estimated from luminosity , this issue is avoided , however other uncertainties arise . during the pre ",
    "main - sequence contraction stars drop sharply in luminosity , and so the estimated masses depend strongly on the assumed age , which is typically uncertain by several myr .",
    "luminosities are also affected by uncertainties in extinction and distance . for comparison ,",
    "a 10% error in a cluster distance manifests as a 20% error in luminosity , which in turn biases masses by roughly 1020% at the substellar boundary , and by up to 50% below the substellar boundary where deuterium burning effects become particularly important .",
    "similarly , a change of 2 myr ( @xmath220% ) in assumed age for a region like upper sco can translate to 2050% change in mass .",
    "ideally imf measurements for young clusters should be estimated by multiple techniques to combat these uncertainties . to our knowledge",
    ", the upper sco dataset published by @xcite is the only large sample of young low - mass objects with  and  measurements for every object .",
    "this makes it possible to estimate masses from  while correcting for the influence of magnetic activity . to extend this type of analysis and test the imf in diverse regions",
    ", it would be desirable to obtain activity measurements ( e.g. ,  ews ) for large samples of young very low mass objects in other star forming regions .",
    "an ancillary impact of accurate mass determinations in young clusters is the validation of atmosphere models for comparison with young exoplanets , as there remains a need to understand how spectral class maps to mass and age in isolated objects in order to make comparison models for massive exoplanets .",
    "most importantly , measuring the tail of the imf in young clusters is vital for our understanding of star formation , and in particular the role of turbulence in producing cluster - cluster variations .",
    "if changes to the imf are most dramatic at lower masses , accurate measurements in young clusters are most important .",
    "our work here suggests that unmodeled physics such as magnetic activity can substantially influence the low mass end of the imf .",
