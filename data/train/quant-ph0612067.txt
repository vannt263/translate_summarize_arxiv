    "the subject of quantum measurements is as old as the very foundation of quantum mechanics . for a long time",
    "the scheme of sudden state reduction , proposed by von neumann , has been prevalent .",
    "he conjectured that the measurement of an observable on a system entails its state reduction to one of its eigenstates , or shortly , a sudden change of the system state by projection .",
    "however , on probing an electromagnetic ( em ) field state through a photocount process , the photons are detected and counted one by one , a photon entering a photomultiplier tube provokes a burst of electrons ( a photocurrent ) which is viewed as originating from that single photon .",
    "it is then registered and counted .",
    "a sequence of bursts in a given time interval is associated to the photocount process .",
    "so , the determination of the field state is not achieved by an instantaneous projective measurement , but it takes some time @xmath0 to count a sequence of photons , whose statistics gives information about the field state . a classical theory describing this process",
    "was proposed by mandel  @xcite .",
    "quantum photocount theories were developed by several authors @xcite ( see the review  @xcite for more references ) .",
    "these theories rely on the assumption of an instantaneous measurement of @xmath1 photons , independently of the duration of the detection . however , actually , photons are counted sequentially , one by one , and the time intervals between counts is irregular and uncontrollable .    for describing more realistically a sequential photocount events in an ideal closed cavity , srinivas and davies ( sd )  @xcite proposed an approach based on the concept of continuous measurement .",
    "their scheme allows calculating various statistical functions , that can be compared with experimental outcomes , such as the probability for counting any number @xmath2 of photons in a time interval @xmath0 and different coincidence probability densities .",
    "the sd model takes into account a back action  of the photodetector on the state of field and gives the conditioned field state , i.e. , the field state just after a given sequence of photocounting events .",
    "a progress in understanding the physical meaning of the axiomatic sd model was achieved due to studies @xcite ( for other references see @xcite ) .    continuous photodetection model ( cpm ) is extensively discussed in the literature @xcite , so we shall mention only its main properties .",
    "the model , also referred as a theory , describes the field state evolution during the photodetection process in a closed cavity and is formulated in terms of two fundamental _ operations _ , assumed to represent the _ only _ events occurring at each infinitesimal time interval .",
    "( 1 ) the one - count operation , represented by the _ quantum jump superoperator _ ( qjs ) , describes the detector s back - action on the field upon a single count , and the trace calculation over the qjs gives the probability per unit time for occurrence of a detection .",
    "( 2 ) the _ no - count _",
    "operation describes the field non - unitary evolution in absence of counts .    if one sets the formal expressions for these operations , all possible outcomes of a photocounting experiment can be predicted .",
    "for instance , the photocounts @xcite and the waiting time ( wt ) waiting1,waiting2,waiting3,waiting4 statistics are among the most common quantities studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "moreover , cpm conferred a new step in photodetection theories by allowing one to determine the field state after an arbitrary sequence of measurements , thus creating the possibility of controlling the field properties in real time experiments @xcite .    actually , the qjs is the main formal ingredient within the theory , since it also dictates the form of the no - count superoperator @xcite .",
    "two different models for the qjs were proposed _",
    "ad hoc_. the first was proposed by srinivas and davies ( sd ) in the original paper @xcite ( we call it _ sd - model _ ) as @xmath3where @xmath4 is the field statistical operator , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the usual bosonic annihilation / creation operators and @xmath7 is roughly the detector s ideal counting rate @xcite . from the very",
    "beginning the authors @xcite denounced the presence of some inconsistences when @xmath8 is employed for describing a real photodetection process , this point was also appointed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this qjs is widely used in the literature ueda2,ueda4,ueda6,a2,a4,a6,a7,a9,a10,a12,a13,a16,b222 .",
    "the other proposal @xcite assumes for the qjs an expression written in terms of the ladder operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( also known as _ exponential phase operators _",
    "p1,p2,vourd92,p3,p4 ) @xmath11 in @xcite we called _ e - model _ such a choice , to distinguish it from the sd qjs ( [ 01 ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath7 may be different for sd- and e- models , but the above notation will not cause confusion in this paper .",
    "besides eliminating the inconsistencies within the sd - model , the use of  the e - model leads to different qualitative and quantitative predictions for several observable quantities .    in section [ sub1 ] we present a microscopic model for the detector assumed to be composed of a sensor ( 2-level quantum object ) and an amplification mechanism ( macroscopic thermal reservoir ) . in section sub2",
    "we compare our model s predictions concerning photodetector properties with experimental data and show that the qjss ( [ 01 ] ) and ( [ 02 ] ) are particular cases of a general time - dependent _ transition superoperator _",
    ", each one occurring in a particular regime of the detector experimental parameters @xcite",
    ". moreover , we point out that by manipulating detector s parameters one could engineer the form of the qjs , thus changing the dynamics of the photodetection , as well as the field state after a sequence of measurements .    a way to check the validity of cpm and to decide which qjs better describes the phenomenon in practice can be accomplished through photodetection experiments in a high finesse cavity by comparing experimental outcomes with theoretical predictions .",
    "however , real detectors and cavities are far from ideal .",
    "so in section [ sub ] we include the main non - idealities [ quantum efficiency ( qe ) and dark counts ] into the cpm and deduce general expressions for the photocounts and the wt distributions . as a practical application , in section [ sub3 ] we give some experimental hints to decide which qjs model actually prevails in a photodetection experiment .",
    "section [ secc ] contains a summary and the conclusions .",
    "we model the photodetector as constituted of two parts : the sensor and the amplification mechanism ( am ) .",
    "the sensor is a two - level quantum object ( atom - like ) with resonant frequency @xmath12 , interacting with the monomodal em field of frequency @xmath13 .",
    "it has the ground @xmath14 and the excited @xmath15 states , so we describe it by the usual jaynes ",
    "cummings hamiltonian @xcite @xmath16where @xmath17 ( assumed to be real , since only its absolute value enters the final expressions ) is the sensor - field coupling constant , and the sensor operators are @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the interaction described by hamiltonian ( [ jch ] ) allows a coherent exchange of excitations between the sensor and the field  the rabi oscillations .    upon absorbing a photon the sensor initially in @xmath14 makes a transition to @xmath15 , and after some time it decays back , emitting a _ photoelectron _ into the am ; after that , the detector is ready for the next photodetection .",
    "the am is a complex macroscopic structure ( e.g. photomultiplier tube ) that somehow amplifies the photoelectron and originates some observable macroscopic effect , giving rise to the click of the detector . in order to describe general features of the am independent of the type of the single photon detector ( spd )",
    ", we model it as a macroscopic thermal reservoir with a mean number of intrinsic excitations @xmath21 ( due to the effects of temperature and internal defects ) .",
    "thus , the whole system field  spd unconditioned time evolution ( when the detector is not monitored @xcite ) is described by the master equation @xcite @xmath22 -\\gamma \\overline{% n}\\left ( \\sigma _ { -}\\sigma _ { + } \\rho _ { t}-2\\sigma _ { + } \\rho _ { t}\\sigma _ { -}+\\rho _ { t}\\sigma _ { -}\\sigma _ { + } \\right )    \\notag \\\\ & & -\\gamma \\left ( \\overline{n}+1\\right ) \\left ( \\sigma _ { + } \\sigma _ { -}\\rho _ { t}-2\\sigma _ { -}\\rho _ { t}\\sigma _ { + } + \\rho _ { t}\\sigma _ { + } \\sigma _ { -}\\right ) ,   \\label{eqmestra}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath23 is the sensor  am coupling constant .    according to cpm",
    ", the trace of qjs applied on the field density operator gives the probability density @xmath24 for the photodetection , i.e. emission of a photoelectron at time @xmath0 , given that at time @xmath25 the detector - field system was in the state @xmath26where @xmath4 is the field statistical operator .",
    "microscopically this means that initially the detector is in the ground state ; then , during the time interval @xmath27 the sensor interacted with the field and it could have absorbed a photon , doing a transition @xmath28 .",
    "so @xmath29 is the probability of the sensor decaying back to @xmath14 during the time interval @xmath30 and simultaneously emitting a photoelectron that will lately originate one click . here , the emission of the photoelectron is our interpretation of how the detector operates , and this phenomenon does not appear explicitly in the formalism .    following the quantum trajectories approach @xcite , @xmath31",
    "is calculated as@xmath32 , \\label{ddd}\\]]where @xmath33 represents the evolution of the field - spd system from initial state @xmath34 at time @xmath25 to the time @xmath0 without detections , and @xmath35 stays for a click ( instantaneous decay of the sensor ) at the time @xmath0 ( in the trace , f stands for the field and d  for the detector ) .",
    "the sensor instantaneous decay @xmath36 is represented by the superoperator @xmath37whose trace gives the probability density of such an event . in eq .",
    "( decay ) @xmath23 stands for the sensor zero - temperature decay rate , and we included the term  @xmath38 because it is natural to assume that the rate of decays is proportional to the effective temperature of the detector ( proportional to @xmath21 ) .",
    "the complementary no - decay superoperator @xmath39 describes the non - unitary evolution of the field ",
    "spd system during time interval @xmath27 without clicks ; it is the solution to the master equation ( [ eqmestra ] ) without the decay term ( decay ) : @xmath40where @xmath41taking the partial trace over the detector variables in ( [ ddd ] ) one obtains the superoperator @xmath42 , \\label{transition}\\]]which describes the back - action of the detector on the field upon one click ",
    "it is the _ transition superoperator _ @xcite and , as will be seen below , its time average defines the qjs .",
    "moreover , the probability density for a count is simply @xmath43 $ ] .    in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ rhou11 ] ) we first do the transformation@xmath44to obtain a simple equation for @xmath45 @xmath46whose formal solution is @xmath47    if one iterates eq .",
    "( [ sasa ] ) and substitutes the result into eq . ( transition )",
    "one gets the following transition superoperator@xmath48where @xmath49for @xmath50 @xmath51    as shown in @xcite it is enough to evaluate just the three initial terms in the sum ( [ ttt11 ] ) , whose constituents are found to be @xmath52where@xmath53 , \\]]@xmath54    substituting these expressions into eq .",
    "( [ ttt11 ] ) , the transition superoperator turns out to be time - dependent , contrary to the standard definition of the qjs .",
    "so we evaluate the qjs as the time average of @xmath55 over the time interval @xmath56 ( to be determined later ) during which the photoelectron is emitted with high probability @xmath57considering the weak coupling ( @xmath58 ) for which the jaynes ",
    "cummings hamiltonian ( [ jch ] ) and the master equation ( eqmestra ) are valid , and expressing the field density operator in fock basis as @xmath59after the averaging in ( [ j - xi ] ) the off - diagonal elements of @xmath60 vanish due to rapid oscillations of the terms @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we are left only with the diagonal elements of @xmath60 . applying the superoperators @xmath62 on the density matrix as in ( [ ttt11 ] ) and evaluating eq .",
    "( [ j - xi ] ) we obtain@xmath63 , \\label{wew}\\]]where the explicit expressions for the @xmath64-dependent functions @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given in @xcite .",
    "the qjs ( [ wew ] ) contains an infinite number of terms , so after a click the initial field state @xmath4 reduces to a mixture of different states , each one with its respective probability . the first term , with coefficient @xmath68 takes out a photon from the field , so it represents a click preceded by a photoabsorption  we call this event a `` bright count '' .",
    "the second term , dependent on @xmath66 ( proportional to @xmath69 quite small as will be shown below ) , does not subtract photons from the field but only modifies the relative weight of the field state components  it represents a `` dark count '' , when the detector emits a click due to the amplification of its intrinsic excitations .",
    "all further terms in eq .",
    "( wew ) are proportional to @xmath70 , @xmath71 ; they describe emissions of several photons into the field upon a click , so we call the first of these term , @xmath72 the `` emission term ''",
    ". there are many different phenomena that give rise to dark counts @xcite , our model takes into account only those causing the sensor s ground ",
    "excited state transition .",
    "since the sensor s state depends on its interaction with the field , the dark counts modify indirectly the relative weight between the field state components  that is why they depend on @xmath64 , what is not obvious at first glance .",
    "now we compare our results regarding spd properties with available experimental data .",
    "experimentally @xcite the dependencies of bright and dark counts rates are set as functions of the light wavelength and the detector s `` bias parameter '' ( bp ) . in the bp we englobe such quantities as bias voltage ,",
    "bias current and other physical quantities the experimenter adjusts in order to achieve simultaneously the highest signal - to - noise ratio @xmath73 and bright counts rate .",
    "@xmath74 is the ratio between the bright , @xmath75 , and dark , @xmath76 , counts rates .",
    "when one increases the bp , the bright counts rate increases while @xmath77 remains unchanged until the _ breakdown _ value of bp , when @xmath77 starts to fall rapidly as function of the bp .",
    "so most detectors usually operate near the bp breakdown in order to achieve the optimal performance . in practice ,",
    "@xmath75 is determined by directing laser pulses containing in average one photon at a given repetition rate on the detector and measuring the rate of counts , so in our model it is described by the term @xmath78 .",
    "analogously , @xmath76 is calculated as the rate of counts in the absence of any input signal , so it is given by @xmath79 .         to do the comparison we need to set the values for our model free parameters : @xmath12 , @xmath17 , @xmath80 and @xmath21 . for simplicity we shall express the frequencies @xmath81 and @xmath13 in terms of respective wavelengths @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "thus we are left with two parameters , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath84 plays the role of the bp .",
    "our general model can not determine the bp@xmath85 dependence for every kind of detector ; nevertheless , one may argue that the bp and @xmath84 must be proportional to each other , since for zero bp one should also have @xmath86 , because in this case the detector would be turned off . here , we do not need to know the exact dependence of the bp on @xmath87 provided we determine the breakdown value @xmath88 corresponding to the bp breakdown at resonance , and take it as a measure of @xmath84 .",
    "after numerical simulations we have chosen values of the free parameters that reproduce qualitatively the common experimental behavior @xcite and lie within the applicability region of the model : @xmath89 nm , @xmath90 hz , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , so @xmath93 , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "moreover , we verified that below @xmath94 both @xmath75 and @xmath76 have approximately linear dependence on @xmath84 , in agreement with our qualitative arguments . in figure 2 we plot @xmath95 for two different values of @xmath84 as function of the light wavelength , where we see a good agreement with experimental results @xcite and can check that @xmath96 is proportional to @xmath84 . we also confirmed numerically that @xmath97 does not depend on the field wavelength , as expected .",
    "we verified that for the chosen parameters the emission terms [ @xmath98 and further terms in eq .",
    "( [ wew ] ) ] are at least 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the dark counts term and even more for bright counts term in eq .",
    "( [ wew ] ) .",
    "this confirms that detectors do not emit photons into the field .",
    "intuitively , the emission of photons by the detector would be possible only at temperatures much higher than room temperature through black body radiation , which is not the case in experiments .",
    "thus , in practice one is dealing only with bright and dark counts terms that act on the field simultaneously every time a count is registered , so the qjs takes the form @xmath99 , \\]]where diag means diagonal terms in fock basis . in figure 3 we show the dependence of the normalized bright counts term @xmath100 on @xmath64 in di - log scale ( for better visualization we joined the points ) .",
    "we note that near and far away from resonance ",
    "see the values of @xmath83 in the caption ",
    "one has nearly polynomial dependence ( linear in di - log scale ) @xmath101with @xmath102 at resonance and @xmath103 far away from it .",
    "thus , in these cases one can write the operator dependence of bright counts as @xmath104thus recovering the e - model with @xmath102 at the resonance and sd - model with @xmath103 far away from it , although the values of @xmath96 are different in each case ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the normalized dark counts term @xmath105 is shown in figure 4 in linear scale and in di - log scale in the inset . out of resonance @xmath106",
    "is almost independent on @xmath64 , so in this case @xmath107 . at the resonance , for @xmath108 one gets @xmath109 and for @xmath110 we have @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 is a number less than @xmath114 ( @xmath76 does not depend on the wavelength ) .",
    "this means that at resonance the dark counts are suppressed in the presence of light .",
    "this happens because they occur when the detector in the ground state is excited by its intrinsic processes ; however , at resonance the rate of excitations by photons from the field is much higher than by intrinsic processes , so the dark counts `` have no time '' to appear .",
    "therefore , the operator form of the dark counts term in eq .",
    "( [ wew ] ) is @xmath115 ,   \\label{123}\\]]where @xmath116 , @xmath117 and at resonance we have the e - model with @xmath118 and @xmath119 . far away from resonance",
    "we recover the sd - model with @xmath103 and @xmath120 .",
    "thus we have exposed our microscopic model for the photodetector and showed that when one is concerned about the photodetector behavior , the model agrees with experimental data .",
    "still , the only way to verify whether the formal expressions of qjss resulting from the model hold in practice is to perform photocounting experiments and compare the outcomes , such as photocounts or wt distributions , to the model s prediction . in the next sections we shall treat this issue for realistic situations of detectors with non - unit quantum efficiency and non - zero dark counts rate .",
    "we also discuss possible measurements that may permit to discern between the e - model and the sd - model , even in the presence of low efficiency and dark counts .",
    "we consider a model for a photodetector with non - unit quantum efficiency ( qe ) and a finite dark counts rate . in @xcite we have also considered the effects associated to cavity damping and the detector s dead - time , and showed that they are not crucial when compared to the qe and dark counts .",
    "moreover , as the qjs ( [ 01 ] ) is an unbounded superoperator , the inclusion of dead - time effect into the cpm leads to some inconsistences within sd - model , such as non - normalizable photodetection distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the e - model is free from such problems .",
    "we consider a free electromagnetic monomodal field of frequency @xmath13 , enclosed in an ideal cavity together with a photodetector . the _ unconditioned time evolution _",
    "( ute ) of the field in the presence of the detector , i.e. the evolution when the detector is turned on but the outcomes of the measurements are disregarded ( not registered ) , is described by the master equation @xcite @xmath121the first term on the rhs stands for the free field evolution and the second describes the effect of the detector on the field due to their mutual interaction .",
    "the parameter @xmath122 ( we omit the subscript @xmath123 to simplify the notation ) is the field - detector coupling constant , roughly equal to the ideal counting rate .    to describe photodetection with qe @xmath124 and the dark counts rate @xmath125 ( @xmath126 is the ratio between the dark counts rate and the ideal photon counting rate ) , we take @xmath127 and @xmath120 in eq . ( [ 123 ] ) @xmath128the first term within the parenthesis describes the absorption of a photon from the field with probability per unit time @xmath129 = \\eta \\mathcal{r}\\bar{n}$ ] , where @xmath21 is the field mean photon number ",
    "this means that the detector `` sees '' all the photons .",
    "the second term describes the dark counts , so after a detector s click the field state becomes a mixture of two possible outcomes : either a photon absorption or a dark count .    the no - count state @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the no - count superoperator , obeys eq .",
    "( [ nc ] ) when one subtracts the term ( [ qjs ] ) on the rhs ( see @xcite ) . moreover , as we are interested in calculating probabilities , we shall disregard phase factors @xmath132 , since they are canceled in the trace calculation .",
    "so the evolution equation of @xmath133 is @xmath134we solved this equation in @xcite , obtaining @xmath135the field ute superoperator @xmath136 , defined as the solution to eq .",

    "this is another possible manner for verifying the applicability of sd- or e- models .",
    "we now turn our attention to the wt analysis .",
    "it is important to define the time interval over which we do the average : if one has non - zero dark counts rate , then by performing the average over a very large time interval , we shall always get for the mean wt the value @xmath192 , which is nothing but the mean time interval between consecutive dark counts .",
    "since experimentally the average is done over finite time intervals , we shall proceed in the same way : the mean wt for initial times , when the photon number is significative , is roughly @xmath193 ( because @xmath194 is the effective counting rate ) , so we shall take the average over a time interval @xmath195 .",
    "this means that if one does not detect consecutive counts within the time @xmath148 , such a measurement will not contribute to the average .",
    "in an ideal case this procedure is not necessary because the probability for registering consecutive clicks separated by a large time interval is zero .",
    "mean wt @xmath196 as function of @xmath197 for the number ( n ) and thermal ( t ) states for sd- and e- models . while there are photons in the cavity @xmath196 is constant for the e - model , but increases substantially with time for the sd - model .",
    "in the inset we plot @xmath198 as function of @xmath199 ( assuming the same @xmath200 for both models ) for these states ( in the sd - model @xmath197 is state independent ) . ]    in figure [ figure3 ] we plot the mean wt for the sd- and e- models , for the number and thermal initial states ( for the coherent state we obtain a curve almost identical to the one for the number state ) with @xmath201 as function of the mean photon number in the cavity at the moment of the first click , @xmath202=\\left\\ { \\begin{array}{c } \\bar{n}e^{-{\\mathcal r}t}\\mbox { for sd - model } \\\\",
    "\\bar{n}\\xi _ { 1}\\mbox { for e - model.}% \\end{array}% \\right",
    ".   \\label{ncav}\\]](for completeness , in the inset of figure [ figure3 ] we plot @xmath197 as function of @xmath170 for both models . ) for the e - model , we see that when @xmath197 becomes less than @xmath114 , the wt starts to increase visibly due to the dominance of dark counts , which are much more rare events than absorption of photons .",
    "this is a drastic departure from the ideal case , in which no counts occur after all the photons have been absorbed , so the mean wt saturates at the inverse value of the counting rate , as shown in @xcite .",
    "moreover , from figure figure3 one verifies that as long as there are photons in the cavity the mean wt is nearly time - independent within the e - model ( and truly independent in the ideal case @xcite ) , and does increase substantially in time for sd - model .",
    "this is another notable qualitative difference that could be verified experimentally .",
    "we presented a microscopic model for a photodetector modeled as a 2-level quantum sensor plus a macroscopic amplification mechanism . using the quantum trajectories",
    "approach we deduced a general qjs describing the back - action of the detector on the field upon a photocount and showed that it can be represented formally as an infinite sum of terms . in that sum",
    "we have identified the terms corresponding to the bright counts ( photoabsorptions ) , the dark counts and emission events , each one occurring with its respective probability .",
    "adjusting the free parameters of the model to fit experimental data , we showed that the emission terms can be disregarded in realistic situations since their contribution becomes insignificant , so the qjs consists effectively only of bright and dark counts terms .",
    "moreover , we have simulated the experimental behavior of the counting rates and the signal - to - noise ratio , showing the breakdown phenomenon .",
    "we have also showed that with the detector operating near its breakdown bias one can engineer the qjs by modifying the wavelength of the field . in particular",
    ", one recovers the qjss proposed previously _",
    "ad hoc _ : at resonance one gets the e - model , and far away from it the sd - model is identified .",
    "we have also generalized the continuous photodetection model through a quantum treatment of non - ideal effects that are ubiquitous in experiments .",
    "we derived general expressions for the fundamental operations in the presence of non - unit quantum efficiency and dark counts , and calculated explicitly the photocounts and the waiting time probability distributions for initial coherent , number and thermal field states . by calculating the first and second factorial moments of the photocounts and the mean waiting time",
    ", we showed that in standard photodetection experiments one could check the applicability of the qjs of sd- or e- models .",
    "namely , we indicated three different ways for revealing the actual qjs : ( 1 ) quantitatively , by studying the time dependence of the normalized second factorial photocounts moment .",
    "qualitatively , we showed that the models can also be distinguished by measuring : ( 2 ) whether the effective detection time depends on the initial average photon number in the cavity and ( 3 ) whether the mean waiting time is modified as time goes on .",
    "still , if the experimental data would depart significantly from the theoretical predictions one should reconsider both models and try to look for alternative mechanisms to reproduce the outcomes ."
