    "in 1996 m. isobe and y. ueda@xcite published magnetic susceptibility measurements of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  powder samples , proposing the existence of linear antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains and a possible spin - peierls transition at a critical temperature , t@xmath6  =  34  k. the original picture of the charge ordering in this mixed valence ladder compound was that of alternating legs of v@xmath7 and v@xmath8 ions.@xcite however , a recent determination of the crystal structure using single crystal x - ray diffraction at room temperature@xcite yielded only one symmetrically inequivalent vanadium ( v@xmath9 ) position .",
    "due to the observed one - dimensional character of the spin and charge system at room temperature - which was by that time also confirmed by inelastic neutron scattering@xcite and angle - resolved photoemission experiments@xcite - the picture of linear chains of v - o - v rungs containing a single @xmath10-electron in a molecular orbital - like state with antiferromagnetic alignment along the ladders has increasingly won recognition . below t@xmath6 charge ordering has been observed in @xmath11v nmr studies,@xcite but the ordering pattern has not yet been defined .",
    "calculations of the electronic ground state@xcite have predicted a zig - zag charge ordering along the ladders and only lately , with the support of the most recent experimental data@xcite does the evidence for zig - zag order appear to outweigh that for more complicated order patterns.@xcite nevertheless , there remain a number of important , open questions such as the nature of the correlations between the charges and spins which are the driving force for the observed charge ordering and which make the system insulating .    the electronic structure of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  has been intensively studied experimentally by means of optical absorption@xcite and reflectivity,@xcite as well as theoretically within the framework of bandstructure calculations",
    "@xcite and exact diagonalization techniques.@xcite nevertheless , there is a controversial discussion about the origin of the electronic excitations in this system .",
    "for example , concerning the absorption peak occurring at about 1  ev in optics , transitions between bonding and antibonding combinations of v  3@xmath4 states,@xcite transitions between vanadium states of different symmetry@xcite as well as on - site @xmath12 transitions between crystal - field - split vanadium 3@xmath10 states@xcite have been proposed as the origin of this feature .",
    "furthermore , the information from the experiments still appears to be insufficient to enable the definition of a unique parameter set for the description of the electronic structure of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 . in particular , independent of",
    "which theoretical model was used , significantly different values for the on - site coulomb repulsion u , the inter - site coulomb repulsion @xmath13 between electrons on legs of adjacent ladders and the hopping parameter @xmath14 have been discussed in the literature ( for a comparison see table  [ parameters ] ) . since the charge ordering as well as",
    "the charge transport properties strongly depend on the energies described by these parameters , a more exact determination of their values could lead to a better understanding of the electronic properties of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 .    in this contribution , we present a joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the electronic excitations and their momentum dependence in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 measured using high resolution electron energy - loss spectroscopy in transmission .",
    "the comparison of the data with models based both on the lsda+u formalism , as well as a cluster approach , enable the construction of a consistent theoretical description of the electronic structure of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 and result in the determination of a double - checked parameter set .",

    "because of the good cleavage behavior , the crystallinity remains conserved after cutting parallel to the @xmath5 plane .",
    "the high quality and orientation of the single crystalline samples were checked by _ in  situ _ electron diffraction .",

    "eels in transmission provides us with the momentum and energy dependent loss function im(- 1/@xmath18(@xmath19 , @xmath20 ) ) , from which , by means of the kramers - kronig relations , the real part of the negative inverse dielectric function and thus all the optical properties such as , for example , the optical conductivity @xmath21 can be calculated . for small momentum transfer only dipole transitions",
    "are allowed , and for the limit q = 0 the transition matrix elements are the same as in optics . for the kramers - kronig analysis the loss spectra closest to the optical limit ( q = 0.1 @xmath15 ) were used in order to derive the optical conductivity spectra .",

    "the absorptive part of the optical conductivity tensor components was computed from the lmto energy bands and eigenvectors on the basis of the linear - response expressions,@xcite whereas the dispersive part was obtained via the kramers - kronig transformation .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  can be considered as composed of linear chains of v - o - v rungs containing a single @xmath10- electron in a molecular orbital - like state with antiferromagnetic alignment along the ladders .",
    "for the lsda+@xmath3 calculations presented here , initially an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order of each of the v spins along the leg of the ladder is assumed .",
    "we have also carried out a brief analysis of the influence of deviations from this afm order upon the calculated dos and optical conductivities by means of spin - waves .",
    "the band structure calculations for non - collinear magnetic structures including constrained moment directions were performed using the formalism developed in the refs .   and .",
    "the magnetization direction in the atomic sphere surrounding the site @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is its position in the unit cell and @xmath40 is a real space lattice vector , is defined by two polar angles @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath41 does not depend on @xmath40 and @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 ( @xmath44 determines the relative orientation of the magnetization directions for different sublattices ) , the calculations can be performed without an enlargement of the unit cell for an arbitrary vector @xmath45 , which defines a spiral magnetic structure in real space .",

    "( [ lost ] ) by direct diagonalization using the standard lanczos algorithm.@xcite as this method is limited to small clusters , the maximum cluster size in our calculations was restricted to 16 vanadium sites .",
    "however , calculations for a cluster consisting of two adjacent ladders , each containing four rungs , showed strong finite - size effects .",
    "we have solved this problem by using two different clusters for momentum transfer parallel to * a * and * b * direction , as denoted in fig .",

    "a * direction we chose an array of double rungs extending over four adjacent ladders , whereas in the * b * direction the cluster consisted of a single ladder with eight rungs .",
    "the separation into these two clusters is justified by the small value of the interladder hopping amplitude @xmath71  ev ( details will be given elsewhere@xcite ) .",
    "this value of @xmath14 has also been found by previous lda calculations@xcite , as well as from a tight binding fit to our own lda results.@xcite additional evidence for a small @xmath14 follows from the weak magnetic dispersion along the * a * direction as observed in neutron scattering experiments.@xcite    for the calculation of the loss function we chose open boundary conditions , and for momentum transfer parallel to the * a * direction we used renormalized intersite coulomb interactions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "these values follow from a straightforward analysis of the influence of adjacent rungs of the same ladder on the electronic states.@xcite furthermore , in the case of open boundary conditions one has to make sure that electrons on the edges of the cluster are still embedded in the local coulomb potential that results from a zig - zag charge ordered state .",
    "thus , sites on the edge of the cluster for momentum transfer parallel to the * a * direction are assigned an additional on - site energy @xmath13 . by analogy ,",
    "sites on the edges of the cluster for * q * parallel to the * b * direction need an additional on - site energy @xmath74 , if they are not occupied in a zig - zag charge ordered state .",
    "we have measured the energy dependent loss functions for different momentum transfers * q * parallel to the crystallographic * a * and * b * direction in an energy range between 0.5  ev and 70  ev . due to the contribution of the elastic line and surface losses it is not possible to measure at zero momentum transfer but close to the optical limit ( q  =  0.1  @xmath15 ) . in fig .",
    "[ optlim ] the loss functions with momentum transfer * q *  =  0.1  @xmath15 parallel to the * a * ( solid line ) and the * b * direction ( dashed line ) are shown .",
    "both spectra are dominated by a broad feature at around 23  ev which represents the volume plasmon - a collective excitation of the valence electrons . while the feature at 50  ev results from local excitations between the v  3@xmath25 and the v  3@xmath10 states , the features emerging below the volume plasmon energy can be assigned to transitions of the valence electrons into the conduction band . as fig .",

    "the comparison with the optical conductivity of the structurally related v@xmath1o@xmath2 ( d@xmath75 configuration ) obtained with the same method,@xcite shows that above @xmath765  ev the spectra of both compounds look very similar ( not shown ) . in ref .",
    ", the anisotropy of the loss function and of the optical conductivity of v@xmath1o@xmath2 are discussed in detail . as a result",
    ", the features above 5  ev can be assigned to transitions from occupied bands with mainly oxygen character into unoccupied bands which are dominated by the v  3@xmath10 states . from the resemblance of the spectra and the related crystal structures of both compounds",
    "we conclude that the same holds for @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "thus , in this work we focus on the energy range below 5  ev where the loss functions and , consequently , the optical conductivities of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  differ strongly from those of v@xmath1o@xmath2 .      in comparison to v@xmath1o@xmath2 , which has a similar network of linked vo@xmath2 pyramids ,",
    "the na atom in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  donates an additional electron to the valence band . since in v@xmath1o@xmath2 the bands formed by the o 2@xmath25 states",
    "are essentially completely filled and the energetically lowest lying unoccupied bands are formed by the v  3@xmath4 states , @xcite the additional electron in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  goes into the rather localized v  3@xmath4 states .",
    "these states determine , to a great extent , the fascinating properties of this compound . due to the localized nature of the v  3@xmath10 electrons ,",
    "the coulomb correlations between them are rather strong and , as a consequence , conventional l(s)da calculations fail to describe properly the electronic structure of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 . in the unit cell corresponding to the centrosymmetric @xmath77 structure of the high temperature phase ,",
    "a non - magnetic metallic solution is obtained , in contradiction to the experimental data .",
    "one way to overcome this discrepancy is to introduce an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order of v magnetic moments along the * b * direction .",
    "this leads to a doubling of the unit cell and the opening of an energy gap in the lsda band structure .",
    "however , the value of the energy gap is still strongly underestimated .",
    "it should , however , be borne in mind there is no experimental evidence for the existence of afm order in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  even at low temperatures .    an efficient way to take the strong correlations in the v  3@xmath10 shell into account is to use the lsda+@xmath3 approach .",
    "however , this method is usually applied to ordered compounds and thus an additional assumption has to be made in order to study the electronic structure and the optical properties of the high temperature phase of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "since , according to the experimental data , there is no charge ordering above @xmath78 and all v sites are equivalent,@xcite we have assumed that the effective one electron potential at each v site is the same and equal to the average of the lsda+@xmath3 potentials for v@xmath7 and v@xmath8 ions . in other words ,",
    "the orbital dependent potential is calculated using the occupation numbers averaged formally over the v@xmath7 and v@xmath8 orbital occupation numbers .",
    "on application of @xmath3 , the partially occupied v @xmath4 orbitals are the most affected .",
    "the average occupation of the majority - spin @xmath4 orbitals is close to 0.5 and their energy position remains unchanged as compared to lda , whereas the unoccupied minority - spin @xmath4 orbitals are shifted upwards by @xmath79 . as a result , an insulating behavior - with the magnetic moment of 0.5 @xmath80 per v atom - or 1 @xmath80 per rung - is immediately obtained , which is independent of the kind of magnetic order which is assumed along the * b * axis .",
    "one can say that the on - site coulomb repulsion effectively suppresses the occupation of the @xmath4 orbitals with the opposite spin at each rung .    the effect of the absence , in reality , of long range afm order in the high temperature phase of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  on the electronic structure and optical properties was modelled by performing calculations for spin waves defined by a vector @xmath81 with @xmath82 varying from 0.5 ( corresponding to afm order of v magnetic moments along the * b * direction ) , to 0 at which all v magnetic moments are ferromagnetically aligned .",
    "in these calculations all @xmath83 were set to zero , whereas the @xmath44 were chosen in such a way that the v ions situated at the same rung had the same magnetization direction .",
    "we found that the relative orientation of the magnetization at v sites of neighbouring ladders , which is also determined by @xmath44 , has only minor effect on the calculated band structure .",
    "the calculations were iterated to self - consistency for @xmath84 and then one iteration was performed for spin waves with other values of @xmath82 .",
    "the comparison of the band energies confirmed that the ground state of the system is antiferromagnetic , in accordance with previous estimates for the exchange coupling constants between v spins in the * b * direction .",
    "the densities of the v  3@xmath10 and o  2@xmath25 states , calculated for @xmath85  =  3  ev and an afm order of the v magnetic moments along the * b * direction are shown in fig .",
    "[ dos ] . in fig .",
    "[ dos]b , the density of v  3@xmath10 states calculated for @xmath86 ( dashed lines ) is also shown . here , and",
    "in the following , we assume that the magnetic moments of the v ions situated at the same rung are ferromagnetically ordered .",
    "the overall structure of the dos is similar to that of v@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite the states in the energy range from -6.5 to -2  ev are formed mainly by the o  2@xmath25 states ( fig .",
    "[ dos]a ) with a bonding hybridization with the v  3@xmath10 states .",
    "the v  @xmath87 states dominate in the 1.83  ev range , while the states with v  @xmath88 and v  @xmath89 character are shifted to higher energies due to the comparatively strong hybridization with o  2@xmath25 states and form the upper part ( @xmath90  ev ) of the conduction band , shown in fig .",
    "the main differences in the structure of the dos as compared to v@xmath1o@xmath2 are caused by the additional electrons occupying the v  @xmath4 bands which are empty in the case of v@xmath1o@xmath2 . since the change in the occupation of the v  @xmath4 states is the main source of the differences between the optical spectra and other physical properties of these compounds , in the following we will focus our attention on the states originating from the v  @xmath4 orbitals .",
    "the narrow peak in the majority - spin v  3@xmath10 dos just below the fermi level ( fig .  [ dos]b ) originates from a combination of the 3@xmath4 orbitals of the two v atoms on the same rung which is orthogonal to the 2@xmath91 orbital of the o@xmath92 atom in the center of the rung .",

    "v  v hopping these two peaks result from the bonding and antibonding combination of the v  3@xmath4 states , respectively , and the energy separation between them is determined by @xmath93  =  0.38  ev acting across the rung . here , for the effective v ",
    "v hopping terms we use the values obtained from a tight binding fit to the lda band structure calculated with the lmto method , @xcite which were found to be very close to the hopping parameters determined in ref .  .",
    "the minority spin @xmath94 states of bonding character are shifted to higher energy by the effective coulomb repulsion and lie above the antibonding @xmath95 peak . while the energy of the latter is governed by @xmath93 and thus does not depend on @xmath85 , the relative position of the minority spin @xmath94 states does depend on the exact value of @xmath85 .",
    "finally , the peak at @xmath762.5  ev arising from the antibonding @xmath94 states is almost lost in the contributions from the other states of the conduction band , mainly formed by the remaining v  3@xmath10 states hybridized with o  2@xmath25 states .",
    "it should be noted that for both spin directions the width of the bonding @xmath4 peaks in the lsda+@xmath3 calculations is much smaller than 0.7  ev , the value obtained from lda calculations , because the relatively strong hybridization along the * b * direction governed by @xmath96  =  0.17  ev is suppressed due to the afm order .",
    "however , as @xmath82 - which defines the magnetic structure along the * b * direction - decreases , the width of the peaks increases and reaches the lda value when the v magnetic moments are ordered ferromagnetically . as for the antibonding @xmath4 states , the dispersion of the corresponding bands along the @xmath97@xmath98 direction is much weaker already in lda @xcite and the width of their dos does not depend on @xmath82 .      in order to verify our theoretical results",

    "since the final states for the corresponding transitions ( i.e. the antibonding v  @xmath4 states ) remain very narrow independent of the nature of the magnetic order along the * b * direction , the increase in the width of the peak reflects the change of the density of the occupied v  @xmath4 states ( i.e the initial states ) .",
    "the shape of the low energy peak in @xmath100 ( fig .",

    "for @xmath106 the initial and final states are formed by pure majority and minority - spin states , respectively , and the corresponding transitions are forbidden ( since the relativistic effects were not included in the calculations ) .",

    "we exploit the strength of eels in transmission as a measure of the bulk optical properties ( in this case of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 ) for finite momenta , thus giving additional insight into the nature of the two - particle excitations in this complex system .      in the left panels of fig .",

    ". the intensities in the * a * direction are about two times larger than those with the same momentum transfer in the * b * direction . for * q*@xmath103*a * , the maximum lies at 1.55  ev compared with 1.45  ev for * q*@xmath103*b*. at high momentum transfers the fine structure of the feature around 1.5  ev in the * a * direction indicates the presence of transitions into more than a single final state .",
    "one can distinguish between essentially three features , whereby the intensity of the component with its maximum at 1.55  ev decreases more rapidly with q than the features at 1.2 and 1.7  ev , the latter pair being visible as weak shoulders only for high momentum transfers . in the * b * direction the low energy feature",
    "is also composed of more than one component - at least at high * q*. the energetically lowest lying feature ( at @xmath76  0.9  ev ) - which can be seen as a shoulder at q  @xmath109  0.4  @xmath15 - looses intensity only slowly with increasing q. the second component , which one can relate to the main intensity maximum ( ca .",
    "1.3 ev ) decreases more strongly in intensity at higher q.",
    "lastly , for q@xmath110  @xmath15 , a third component is visible at higher energy ( ca . 1.7 ev ) .    finally , we turn to the features in the loss function at energies above 3  ev , which , as in the data recorded at the low - q limit , are clearly separated from the lower energy features by a strong drop of spectral weight between 2 and 3  ev . in the * a * direction a steep increase of spectral",
    "weight occurs at 3  ev , which evolves into a maximum at 3.5  ev . with increasing momentum transfer the peak position of this feature",
    "does not change and the intensity decreases slowly . a peak at the same energy position with a similar shape was observed for the * a * as well as for the * b * direction in the loss functions of v@xmath1o@xmath2 , and is assigned to transitions from the o  2@xmath25 states into the lowest unoccupied v  3@xmath4 states.@xcite however , in the eels spectra of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 , the shape of the corresponding feature in the * b * direction differs by the presence of a double - peaked structure with maxima at 3.5  ev and 5.1  ev .",
    "the two peaks merge together with increasing momentum transfer , and for q  @xmath109  0.7  @xmath15 a further feature becomes visible at @xmath763.8  ev .",
    "since in electron energy - loss spectroscopy the cross section for dipole transitions decreases and that for dipole forbidden transitions increases with increasing momentum transfer , the latter 3.8 ev feature is most likely related to monopole or quadrupole transitions .",
    "having described the experimental loss functions as a function of momentum , we now discuss the results of the cluster model calculations aimed at their simulation .      in fig .",
    "[ lossf ] the results of our cluster calculations ( see section [ clustercal ] ) are compared with the experimental spectra.@xcite such cluster calculations require , naturally , input parameters which in turn describe the essentials of the physics of the system in question . in this case , for the transfer integrals we take the values @xmath111  ev , @xmath112  ev , @xmath113  ev from our tight - binding fit to the band structure calculations mentioned earlier . these values are identical to those of ref .  .",

    "here we take a value of 2.8 ev - a choice which is guided by the range of @xmath114 which came out of the lsda+@xmath3 calculations presented and discussed above .    at this stage",
    "we can have faith in these parameters for two reasons .",
    "firstly , it is well known that lda does a good job in describing the charge distribution , and hence the hybridisation / transfer integrals , even in systems with strong electronic correlation .",
    "secondly , the good basic agreement between the optical conductivity calculated within lsda+@xmath3 with experiment ( see sec .  [ optcon ] ) not only lends support to the @xmath49 s , but underpins the chosen @xmath3 value .",
    "the exchange interactions were parametrized as @xmath115 and the values of the intersite coulomb interactions @xmath116  ev and @xmath117ev fulfill the condition for the system to be close to a quantum critical point caused by charge ordering , as described by cuoco et al .. @xcite the inter - ladder coulomb interaction @xmath118  ev has been adjusted within the model to obtain the correct peak positions with respect to the experimental loss functions . to allow a direct comparison with experiment ,",
    "the calculated data were broadened with a gaussian function of 0.3  ev width .",
    "the unbroadened spectra for @xmath119    are also shown as vertical lines in figs .",
    "[ lossf]b and [ lossf]d .",
    "as the cluster model contains only v sites , we only attempt to simulate the loss function in the low energy range ( i.e. for @xmath120  3ev ) . at higher energies - as we know from our combined analysis of the experimental and theoretical optical conductivities ( sec .",
    "[ optcon ] ) - excitations from o  2@xmath25 to v  3@xmath10 orbitals play a role .",
    "thus this spectral weight can not be described within the present cluster model .",
    "we find a good agreement between theory and experiment for the low energy part of the loss function for * q*@xmath103*a * , in particular for the data recorded at higher q ( see fig .",
    "[ lossf]a and [ lossf]b ) .",
    "specifically , the intensity reduction and increasing width of the experimentally observed structure between @xmath121 and @xmath122  ev for q  @xmath17  0.5  @xmath15 is well reproduced in the cluster calculation , a characteristic which eluded our best efforts within the lsda+@xmath3 approach . for the calculated loss function with *",
    "q*@xmath103*b * ( fig .  [ lossf]d ) , the experimental q - dependent reduction in intensity is also well reproduced .",
    "however , in this case the simulation fails to reproduce accurately the large width of the low - energy feature - a shortcoming which becomes increasingly apparent for higher q.    in order to enable a discussion of the origin of the individual features underlying the calculated spectra , one should note that since @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2  is close to a charge order transition,@xcite one can describe the nature of the excitations using a zig - zag ordered ground state . in this context",
    ", we mention that excitations with momentum transfer parallel to the * a * direction lead to a disturbance of the charge ordering as they involve hopping of electrons from one side of a rung to the other .",
    "note that this process can also be interpreted as a transition from a bonding to an antibonding state of a singly occupied rung , in agreement with the results from recent calculations using the heitler - london model.@xcite since the net inter - ladder coulomb interaction , @xmath13 , remains unchanged after the hopping on the rung in the charge ordered state , the excitation energy is dominated by @xmath74 .",
    "in addition to the one electron hopping discussed above , there are also collective processes that involve two or three neighboring rungs on different ladders .    as the unbroadened theoretical results presented in fig .  [",
    "lossf]b show , the theoretical spectra consist of three main features , each of which can be attributed to a density oscillation ( plasmon ) with energies between @xmath121 and @xmath122  ev . for * q*@xmath103*a",
    "* , the spectral weight shifts from the plasmon at @xmath123  ev to the one at @xmath124  ev with increasing @xmath19 , which makes it appear as if the low lying feature as a whole disperses to higher energy , which is not , in fact , the case .",
    "the three excitations differ in their degree of delocalization .",
    "the excitation at @xmath125  ev is related to rather delocalized transitions involving more than one electron in the cluster .",
    "the higher lying plasmons , however , result from more localized processes .    for momentum transfer parallel to the * b * direction , the excitations contributing to the low lying spectral weight ( see fig .",
    "[ lossf]d ) can be interpreted as transitions from a state in which two rungs are singly occupied to one in which one rung is empty and the other doubly occupied . due to the finite hopping amplitude @xmath126  ev , the unoccupied and the occupied rung are able to move along the ladder independently from each other .",
    "thus , many more final states are available in the * b * direction than in the * a * direction .",
    "the energies of the transitions into these final states depend on the distance between the unoccupied and the doubly occupied rung . however , since we can observe only localized excitations by the direct diagonalization of small clusters , we are unable to capture fully the dynamics of these excitations and thus we miss some spectral weight ( in the form of spectral breadth ) in the theoretical spectra ( fig .",
    "[ lossf]d ) compared to the experimental data ( fig .",
    "[ lossf]c ) .",
    "this explanation is supported by a further reduction of spectral weight in the cluster calculation when we adopt a four - rung ladder , in place of the eight rung cluster from which the results are presented here .",
    "thus , in contrast to the good description of the strongly localized excitations in the * a * direction described earlier , for * q*@xmath103*b * we find that the theory significantly underestimates the spectral weight , due to finite size effects in the cluster calculation . that these differences also persist in the high q regime illustrates that the cluster size imposes limitations even in the case where the excitations have shorter wavelength .",
    "nevertheless , it should be pointed out that the cluster calculations do provide a qualitative description of both position and the q - dependent decrease of intensity of the experimental features .",
    "the optical conductivity can also be calculated using the same , cluster - based method . with the same model parameters we obtain a qualitative agreement with the optical conductivity , either as derived from eels or optical measurements @xcite ( not shown ) . however - as was the case for the lsda+@xmath3 data - the asymmetric line shape in @xmath34 could not be fully reproduced in the cluster calculation .",
    "we ascribe this to the delocalized character of some of the final states , which at * q *  =  0 ( i.e. at infinite wavelength ) therefore elude our calculations based upon a finite cluster .",
    "we note here that a similar type of calculation has been carried out recently,@xcite and a good agreement between theory and the ( q  =  0 ) optical conductivity was found , albeit with a rather high value of the inter - ladder hopping integral @xmath127  ev .",
    "the momentum - dependent eels data presented here allow a further test of the theoretical parameters beyond the optical limit .",
    "we have found that adopting @xmath127  ev in our @xmath49-@xmath30-@xmath50 model calculations yields a significantly worse agreement with the experimental data than does the value of @xmath113  ev , which also comes out of the tight binding fit to the band structure .",
    "consequently , it appears as if a large value of the interladder hopping is not a requirement for an accurate description of the charge excitations in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 .    to summarize",
    ", one can say that while the small inter - ladder hopping gives a rationale for the quasi one - dimensional character of the dynamics of the v  3@xmath10 electrons ; the fact that all three inter - site coulomb interactions ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath13 ) are of similar size is consistent with the two - dimensional nature of the charge ordering occurring at low temperatures in this system .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the optical properties and collective excitations of @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 . from measurements by means of high resolution eels in transmission ,",
    "we have derived @xmath99 and @xmath100 in the optical limit and have also presented the momentum dependence of the loss function with momentum transfers parallel to the crystallographic * a * and * b * directions .",
    "the densities of states and optical conductivities were calculated within an lsda+@xmath3 framework , with the spin order at the v sites either described in terms of an antiferromagnetic or spin - wave - like arrangement , whereas the momentum dependent loss functions were simulated using a quarter - filled @xmath49-@xmath30-@xmath50 model based upon a cluster of 16 vanadium sites .    for * q * parallel to both the * a * and * b * directions , the low energy features of the spectra are essentially dispersionless - which is in keeping with the small band width of the unoccupied states directly above the chemical potential predicted in the lsda+@xmath3 calculations .",
    "the comparison between the experimental @xmath34 s ( measured in the optical limit ) and those derived from the lsda+@xmath3 calculations yielded a good agreement upon adoption of an on - site coulomb interaction @xmath130  ev and an antiferromagnetic ordering of the spins at the v sites in the ladders .",
    "however , the lda - based calculations were not able to reproduce the width of the experimentally observed structures .    based upon the lsda+@xmath3 results , the differences between @xmath99 and @xmath100 could be analyzed in detail and each feature",
    "could be characterized according to the nature of the initial and final states involved in the underlying optical transitions .",
    "for example , it could be shown that the optical conductivity between 0.5 and 1.7  ev is dominated by transitions from the highest occupied band ( bonding combination of v  3@xmath4 states ) into the lowest unoccupied band ( antibonding v  3@xmath4-o@xmath131  2@xmath91 states ) .",
    "while for @xmath99 such an excitation occurs on a single rung , in @xmath100 the same transition can be considered as a hopping process to one of the adjacent rungs .",
    "the higher lying features in the optical conductivity ( above 3  ev ) are shown to be related to transitions originating in the o  2@xmath25 valence band manifold .    taking the transfer integrals and @xmath3 value from our lsda+@xmath3 data ( the accuracy of which",
    "is checked by the comparison with the experimental @xmath34 s ) , the @xmath49-@xmath30-@xmath50 cluster model was successful in describing the q - dependence of the intensity and , in particular the observed width of the lowest energy feature at high q for * q*@xmath103*a*. as the high q data probe shorter wavelengths , it is clear that the cluster extension in the * a * direction is sufficient to describe these localized excitations .",
    "the situation is different for the data with * q*@xmath103*b*. here the cluster calculation manages to reproduce the q - dependence of the intensity well , but still fails to correctly account for the width of the experimentally observed feature at high q , thus signalling the impact of finite size effects , even in a 16 site cluster .",
    "the analysis of the momentum dependence of the loss function allows a more precise determination of the values of the model parameters .",
    "the best agreement is achieved with transfer integrals which mirror those derived from the band stucture calculation .",
    "in particular , the inter - ladder hopping , @xmath14 is found to be 0.012  ev , thus confirming the quasi one - dimensional nature of the electronic system in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "finally , the inter - site coulomb interactions @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath13 are found to be of similar magnitude .",
    "these interactions then drive the electronic system close to a quantum critical point between a unordered state at room temperature and a zig - zag ordered state @xcite observed at low temperatures .",
