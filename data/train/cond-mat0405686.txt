    "the authors of ref .   concluded from their fits that the order parameter on the superconductor side might have the time - reversal symmetry breaking ( trsb ) form @xmath4 .",
    "this result was rather surprising , since the contacts had predominantly [ 100 ] orientation and very high transparency , in which case trsb is usually not expected ( see e.g. refs .   and the reviews in refs .  )",

[ fig : nisnoint ] we couple back the non - zero fermi surface average of the off - diagonal green s function in the superconductor side by having a small subdominant pairing interaction ( @xmath105 ) .",

    "we have in mind that the counter electrode in the experiment@xcite was au which is not a superconductor and might have a repulsive effective pairing interaction . the @xmath1-wave pairing correlations leaks over to the n - side , which leads to the non - zero fermi - surface average in eq .",

    "the opposite is also true , the induced @xmath48 is not qualitatively affected by the presence ( @xmath109 ) or absence ( @xmath84 ) of the component @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the proximity induced pair potential on the normal metal side is mainly due to the dominant @xmath1 component .",
    "we also note that the real combination @xmath3 is always favored in the system , as in the case @xmath86 above .    as for the ldos , the induction of the gap amplitude @xmath48 changes the density of states near the contact .",
    "there are new low - energy states , which are formed because of the sign change of the order parameter field for quasiparticles travelling on low - angle trajectories @xmath104 which connect the negative gap @xmath48 on the n - side with the positive lobe of the @xmath1 order parameter on the s - side .",
    "this is analogous to the zero - energy bound states formed at a [ 110 ] surface of a @xmath1 superconducor,@xcite and was also discussed in the study of the superclean case.@xcite in our case , the impurity scattering broadens the states considerably .",
    "thus , compared with the case @xmath86 above , the ldos peak position @xmath95 is drawn closer to the fermi surface . at the same time , the overall modulation of the ldos in the normal metal is reduced compared to the case without the pairing interaction . thus , contrary to our first expectations , an induced non - zero pair potential @xmath48 in the normal metal reduces the proximity effect in the ldos , as compared to the case @xmath110 .",

    "the order parameter amplitude becomes larger and decays slower compared to the repulsive interaction case ( analogous results were also found for the clean case in ref .  ) .",

    ". the ldos variations can be as high as @xmath112 for our choice of parameters , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nis_tn0.01](c ) .",
    "given the fact that there are low - energy states we are tempted to think that a trsb combination @xmath113 could be formed ( at least for @xmath114 for which the split - effect is absent ) , instead of the real @xmath115 combination found above .",
    "if this was the case , the energy of the system might be lowered , similar to what happens at [ 110 ] surfaces or josephson junctions.@xcite however , for the proximity contact we were never able to stabilize a trsb state within the parameter space we have considered .",
    "we understand this result as due to a phase locking between the @xmath2-wave gaps in the n and s sides , to the dominant @xmath1 , that prevents a relative phase @xmath116 between any two components to be formed . compared to the josephson junctions case , the two sides of the proximity contact are not independent : there is no bulk order parameter on the n - side that makes it possible to establish a phase difference @xmath116 over the junction . as for the subdominant @xmath2-wave order parameter on the s - side , it is due to the spatially varying @xmath1 order parameter , and is not induced by the bound state as in the [ 110 ] surface case .",
    "we also note that spontaneous symmetry breaking in the form of a paramagnetic instability@xcite is suppressed by impurity scattering and normal back - scattering at the junction .",
    "we now turn to the [ 110 ] orientation . in previous studies of the clean system,@xcite",
    "no gap amplitude was found in the normal metal side for reasons of symmetry .",
    "as for the ldos in the n side , it is always unchanged in a clean system when the gap amplitude is zero . for @xmath117",
    ", we find no signatures of the proximity effect in the ldos in the dirty case either , which also follows from symmetry arguments .",
    "however , when we include a subdominant component in the superconductor side at a contact with [ 110 ] orientation , it will be formed @xmath116 out of phase with the dominant , and we have a trsb state @xcite ( this is opposite to the [ 100 ] case above ) .",
    "we note that some backscattering is necessary at the junction , i.e. if the transparency @xmath114 there are no zero - energy states and no trsb . as for the proximity effect in the n - side",
    ", high transparency is favorable .",
    "thus , we concentrate on a window of intermediate transparencies , in order to establish a proximity effect between a trsb @xmath113 state at a [ 110 ] interface to a normal metal , see fig .  [",
    "fig : nis_110 ] . clearly , the established @xmath5-part in the s - side , leads to a proximity induced @xmath5 component also in the n - side that decays into the bulk normal metal , although the effect is rather small and short range .",
    "the details of the window of transparencies depend on the mean free paths , as well as the interaction strengths .",
    "typical values where there are trsb and at the same time visible effects in the ldos on the n - side are @xmath118 , for our choice of parameters . the double peak structure on the s - side ,",

    "are related to , but not direct images of , the @xmath2-wave pair potentials @xmath119 and @xmath120 because of the importance of the impurity self - energy .",
    "these results have the potential to serve as a probe of trsb at [ 110 ] interfaces : as the temperature is decreased , the spectrum in the normal metal overlayer remains unchanged ( equal to @xmath82 for all energies ) until the trsb transition is reached , below which a small pseudogap develops as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nis_110 ] .",

    "_ experiment , as to the existence or absence of trsb at low temperatures .",
    "the drawback of the above considerations is that they rely heavily on symmetry arguments .",
    "thus , to a much higher degree than other results in this paper , non - specular interface scattering@xcite could be detrimental .",
    "another caveat is the possibility of @xmath15-wave pairing correlations ( attractive or repulsive ) in the normal metal .",
    "an induced @xmath15-wave pair potential leads to spectral changes in the normal metal for the [ 110 ] orientation also in the absence of trsb , thereby spoiling the symmetry argument .",
    "the ldos is enhanced at low energy by the formation of low - energy andreev states broadened by impurity scattering , if the @xmath15-wave pairing correlations are oriented as [ 110 ] relative to the interface .",
    "this is similar to what happens at josephson junctions between two @xmath15-wave superconductors.@xcite however , it seems unlikely that spatially homogeneous @xmath15-wave pairing correlations with a well - defined orientation relative to the interface could exist in a normal metal such as au .",
    "however , these complications are temperature - independent and should not appear suddenly at the low - temperature trsb transition .",

    "for the [ 100 ] orientation , we always find a real combination @xmath115 in the superconductor . at the same time , the n side gap amplitude is phase locked to the @xmath15-wave order parameter on the s - side . on the other hand , for a [ 110 ] contact with intermediate values of the transparency , a trsb @xmath113 order parameter on the s side , induces an @xmath5 gap amplitude also on the n side .",
    "we note that the subdominant @xmath5 component in the s side is not due to the proximity effect ; rather , it is due to the formation of the bound state at the [ 110 ] interface in the usual way.@xcite the signatures of the proximity effect at [ 110 ] contacts could serve as fingerprints of trsb , with the caveat of possible breaking of the `` selection rule '' by e.g. non - specular scattering or @xmath15-wave pairing correlations in the normal metal .",
    "we finish with a comparison with the experiments.@xcite we can not find evidence of the unusual symmetry breaking proximity effect at [ 100 ] contacts that was proposed in ref .  .",
    "the proximity induced pair potential in the normal metal is due to the suppression of the @xmath15-wave order parameter and no non - trivial relative phase develops . however , a serious comparison with the experiment of kohen _",
    "et al._@xcite can not be done since that was a transport experiment where the conductance was measured .",
    "at the same time , the analysis@xcite in terms of a btk - type theory with postulated pair potentials and no considerations of real non - equilibrium effects , rather than self - consistently computed quantities , might be too simplistic . especially when the contact has high transparency .",
    "for example , a dirty normal metal ( instead of a clean metal as in the btk theory ) in contact with a @xmath15-wave superconductor can lead to quite different results for the conductance , as shown theoretically recently.@xcite those considerations were limited to point contacts with the superconductor a purely @xmath15-wave ( @xmath84 ) , super - clean ( @xmath138 ) , unperturbed reservoir .    on the other hand , our results",
    "is in _ qualitative _ agreement with the experimental results of sharoni _",
    "et al._@xcite the modulations of the density of states consists of a suppression of the density of states at the fermi level ( but not to zero ) , with a quite well defined peak position @xmath139 .",
    "these structures decay into the normal metal on the scale @xmath140 . however , an _ unambiguous quantitative _ fit between theory and data is hard to make for several reasons . on the theory side , even within our simple model ,",
    "the local density of states is sensitive to many parameters , such as the mean free paths , the interface resistance , the fermi velocities , as well as pairing interaction strengths .",
    "the choice of parameters is not unique . on the experimental side ,",
    "only a limited number of spectra were shown , although many points @xmath95 were reported .",
    "in particular , the spectra for small distances were not shown , for which @xmath139 were reported to be spectacularly large @xmath141 mev @xmath142 , which is hard to reproduce in theory ( @xmath143 in figs .  [",
    "fig : nisnoint]-[fig : nis_110 ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that similar ( but not as large ) discrepancies between theory and experiments were recently reported@xcite also for low-@xmath0 contacts ( nb - au ) .",
    "although in that case , the discrepancy was the largest for large distances .",
    "another problem is that the modulation in the ldos appears to be larger than we find ( unless the effective pairing interaction in au is attractive which seems unlikely ) . in particular @xmath144",
    "is suppressed more than we find for the nis system . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental situation was not clean cut : a mixture of the nis and inis systems appears to be relevant . for large ( small ) distances from the @xmath11-facet ,",
    "the setup appears to be nis - like ( inis - like ) .",
    "it is also unclear where along the @xmath60-axis in our fig .",
    "[ fig : nlayer_exp ] the spectra were actually recorded . from their figs .  1 - 2 it appears that the spectra were actually taken at points corresponding to @xmath145 in our fig .",
    "[ fig : nlayer_exp ] , i.e. into the ybco @xmath146-axis .    despite these complications ,",
    "it is quite plausible that the experimental results could be explained by the more conventional type of proximity effect we have discussed in this paper , rather than an exotic proximity effect that involves symmetry breaking .",
    "i would like to thank j.a .",
    "sauls for encouragements to finish this work , and for pointing out the potential importance of repulsive @xmath15-wave pairing correlations in the normal metal .",
    "financial support was provided by the swedish foundation for international cooperation in research and higher education ( stint ) and the wenner - gren foundations ."
