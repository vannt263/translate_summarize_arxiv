    "hybrid quantum systems consisting of quantum mechanical oscillators have become a platform for many interesting applications of quantum mechanics .",
    "in addition to being a tool to understand the quantum to classical transition , e.g. , by creating entanglement between mechanical modes , mechanical oscillators have potential applications in quantum information processing . in this regard , there has been a growing effort in exploiting the mechanical degrees of freedom to engineer devices such as a microwave - to - optical ( or vise versa ) frequency converter @xcite and quantum memory @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum mechanical oscillator has been used as an interface to transfer a quantum state from an optical cavity to a microwave cavity @xcite .",
    "interest in merging optomechanical resonators with solid - state systems has been growing @xcite ; examples include , ultrastrong optomechanical coupling in gaal vibrating disk resonator @xcite , cooling of phonons in a semiconductor membrane @xcite , a strong optomechanical coupling in a vertical - cavity resonator @xcite , and surface - emitting laser @xcite .",
    "coupling a mechanical oscillator to a microcavity that consists of a quantum well has been considered in the context of generating hybrid resonances @xcite among photons , excitons , and phonons , and studying the optical bistability @xcite .",
    "the physics of photon - exciton coupling has extensively been studied as presented in a recent review @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we analyze the entanglement between the mechanical mode and the exciton mode in a quantum well placed at the antinode of a microcavity that is formed by distritbuted brag reflectors ( dbrs ) . even though the exciton and the mechanical modes are initially uncoupled , their interaction with a common quantized microcavity field results in an indirect coupling .",
    "we show that this coupling is a fano - agarwal - type @xcite coupling induced by the decay of the exciton and the mechanical mode caused by the leakage of photons through the microcavity to the environment ( purcell effect @xcite ) .",
    "we analyze the entanglement in the adiabatic regime , where the damping rate of the microcavity exceeds the cavity - exciton coupling strength .",
    "a significant amount of entanglement between the exciton and the mechanical modes can be created at the exciton - mechanical mode hybrid resonance frequencies .",
    "we find that the maximum entanglement between the two modes is achieved when the exciton and the mechanical modes hybridization is maximum .",
    "surprisingly , the entanglement persists at high temperature of the phonon thermal bath .",
    "our entanglement analysis is based on realistic parameters from a recent experiment @xcite .     and has a damping rate @xmath0 .",
    "the dbrs are shifted from the equilibrium position due to the radiation pressure force.,width=302 ]",
    "we consider a microcavity formed by a set of distributed bragg reflector mirrors and consists of a quantum well placed at the antinode .",
    "the microcavity is coupled to the mechanical motion of the mirror via radiation pressure force and to the exciton mode in the quantum well .",
    "an exciton in the quantum well can be considered as a quasi - particle resulting from the interaction between one hole in the valence band and one electron in the conduction band .",
    "when the exciton radius is much smaller than the average distance between neighbouring excitons ( @xmath1 with @xmath2 being exciton concentration ) , we treat the exciton as a composed boson . in general , in the weak excitation regime , where the density of the excitons is sufficiently low",
    ", the interaction between the neighboring excitons due to coulomb interaction is weak and can be neglected .",
    "however , in the moderated driving regime , the interaction between neighbouring excitons becomes strong and nonlinear @xcite , and leads to interesting properties such as squeezing and bistability @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will consider the exciton as a composed boson .",
    "the coupled exciton - optomechanical system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath3here the operators @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are annihilation operators for a photon in the microcavity , an exciton in the quantum well , and a phonon in the mechanical oscillator , respectively .",
    "the microcavity is driven by strong drive with frequency @xmath7 ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the bare microcavity and exciton frequencies . for the mechanical oscillator ,",
    "the resonance frequency is @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the single - photon optomechanical coupling ; @xmath12 is the linear exciton - cavity mode coupling , and @xmath13 @xcite is the nonlinear coefficient describing the exciton - exciton scattering due to coulomb interaction with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 being the electron charge , the exciton bohr radius , the dielectric constant of the quantum well , and the quantization area , respectively .",
    "the strong drive of amplitude @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the drive laser power and the microcavity damping rate , respectively , leads to a large steady - state optical filed in the microcavity which increases the occupation numbers in each mode and the optomechanical coupling .",
    "the resulting steady - state intracavity amplitude in turn shifts the equilibrium position of the mechanical oscillator through radiation pressure force .    in the hamiltonian ,",
    "the the first three terms in the first line represent the free energy of the system while the last term describes the coupling of laser drive with the microcavity . in the second line ,",
    "the first term describes the photon - phonon coupling , the second term represents the linear exciton - photon interaction , and the last term describes the exciton - exciton scattering due to the coulomb interaction . in a frame rotating with the drive frequency @xmath21",
    ", the interaction hamiltonian has the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . using the interaction hamiltonian eq . , we derive coupled equations for the macroscopic fields , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "these equations are obtained by replacing the operators with classical amplitudes in the heisenberg equations : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the exciton spontaneous emission rate , and @xmath30 is the damping rate of the mechanical oscillator .",

    "we discuss exciton - mechanical mode entanglement in the regime where the system is stable .",
    "the nonlinear quantum langevin equations can be linearized by writing the operators as the sum of the steady state classical mean value plus a fluctuating quantum part : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the linearized langevin equations of the fluctuation operators then read @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the many - photon optomechanical coupling with @xmath41 being the steady state mean photon number in the microcavity . for simplicity",
    ", we have chosen the phase of the coherent drive such that @xmath42 .",
    "here @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the langevin noise operators for the microcavity , exciton , and the mechanical modes , respectively .",
    "all noise operators have zero mean , @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that the microcavity and the quantum well are coupled to a vacuum reservoir and thus the noise operator are delta - correlated : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "however , the mechanical oscillator is coupled to a thermal bath and the noise operators have the following nonvanishing correlation properties in the frequency domain : @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , where @xmath51^{-1}$ ] is the mean number of thermal phonons with @xmath52 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath53 the bath temperature .",
    "we next study the entanglement between the exciton and the mechanical modes in the adiabatic regime , where the microcavity damping rate is larger than the exciton - cavity coupling , @xmath54 , the cavity dynamics reaches quasistationary state .",
    "we then adiabatically eliminate the cavity mode degrees of freedom by setting @xmath55 in eq . .",
    "substituting the resulting equation into eqs . and , we obtain coupled equations for @xmath56 and @xmath57 that describe the dynamics of the exciton and the mechanical mode evolutions @xmath58 where @xmath59 with @xmath60 $ ] being the effective relaxation rate of the exciton due to the damping of photons through the microcavity to the environment , also known as the purcell effect @xcite .",
    "note that the relaxation rate of the exciton is increased by @xmath61 as result of interaction with the cavity mode ; @xmath62 $ ] is the effective damping rate of the mechanical mode .",
    "in contrast to the exciton mode evolution , the cavity - induced relation does not affect the decay term in the langevin equation for @xmath57 , it does however appear in the noise terms as manifested in eq . .",
    "note also that the cavity - exciton coupling shifts the exciton frequency by @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , the cavity - mechanical mode coupling gives rise to a shift @xmath64 in the mechanical mode frequency ; @xmath65^{-1/2}$ ] is the contribution of the cavity - induced dissipation to the noise operator of the exciton ( mechanical ) mode and finally @xmath66 is the effective exciton - mechanical mode cross coupling .",
    "notice that the cross coupling depends on the effective decay rates @xmath61 and @xmath67 induced by the photon leakage through the microcavity , which is similar to the fano - agarwal effect @xcite .",
    "dissipation - induced coupling has extensively been explored in quantum optics in creating coherence in three - level atomic systems @xcite . here",
    "we exploit the dissipation - induced coupling to entangle two matter modes : the exciton and the mechanical modes .    to study the entanglement between the exciton and the mechanical modes , it is more convenient to use the quadrature operators defined by , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 and similar definitions for fluctuation operators @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",

    "since we have assumed @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 to be zero - mean gaussian noises and the corresponding equations for fluctuations @xmath99 and @xmath100 are linearized , the quantum steady state for fluctuations is simply a zero - mean gaussian state , which is fully characterized by a correlation matrix @xmath101/2 $ ] . the solution to eq . is stable and reaches the steady state when all of the eigenvalues of @xmath81 have negative real parts . for all results presented in this work",
