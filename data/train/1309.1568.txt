    "in this work we have an unusually complete set of observations with which to analyze oscillations in a large prominence footpoint or barb .",
    "these allow us to combine information concerning both three dimensional motions and magnetic field to analyze these as fast magnetosonic waves moving transverse the prominence magnetic fields and disturbing the cool material collected in the magnetic dips .",
    "periodic motions in solar prominences have been routinely observed since the first observations of such oscillations in the 1950s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these oscillations are classified as large- or small - amplitude oscillations depending on the velocity of the periodic motions , faster or slower than 20 @xmath4 respectively .",
    "large - amplitude oscillations are related to flare activity which causes almost the entire filament to oscillate , shaken by the energetic event .",
    "studies of small - amplitude oscillations have revealed a wide range of periods ranging from seconds to hours @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the literature concerning the small amplitude motions with periods from a few minutes to 10 minutes , called short - period oscillations ( see the review of @xcite ) , that is relevant to our present work .",
    "prominences at the limb exhibit such short period oscillations @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported short period oscillations in dopplershift observations of limb prominences .",
    "two - dimensional observations of filaments on the disk have revealed oscillations transverse to the direction of fine structures of the filaments with a period around 200 sec @xcite .",
    "recent high spatial resolution observations obtained with the sst show the existence of traveling waves with periods of 3 to 9 minutes in fibril - like structures of filaments .",
    "the propagation of the waves are in the same direction as the direction of the prominence fine structures . as the mass flows .",
    "@xcite found that threads in a solar prominence observed with hinode / sot underwent vertically oscillating motions with a period around 250 sec .",
    "some threads oscillate all along the filament length . with hinode / sot data",
    ", @xcite analyzed the oscillations of a quiescent prominence and found a large variety of oscillations both vertical and horizontal with periods of 3 to 6 minutes .",
    "the trigger of the small - amplitude , short - period oscillations has not been detected so far .",
    "many authors claimed that the excitation is related with the 3- and 5-minutes photospheric and chromospheric oscillations .",
    "solar @xmath5-modes are generated by turbulent convection beneath the photosphere leaking part of their power to the atmospheric layers : photosphere , chromosphere , and corona ( 3- and 5-minutes oscillation ) .",
    "oscillations in prominences are usually interpreted as an external agent exciting periodic motions on the cool plasma .",
    "mhd waves can be propagating or standing . propagating waves consist of periodic disturbances that propagate through the prominence plasma .",
    "in contrast , standing waves are confined in a region of the prominence because they are the normal modes of the system .",
    "several theoretical models of prominence oscillations have been proposed .",
    "@xcite considered the whole filament as a vertical plasma slab , ignoring the thread fine structure , with an horizontal straight magnetic field .",
    "the influence of the gravity was considered negligible and the slab and corona plasmas are uniform . in this model the waves are considered trapped along the horizontal direction , and are allowed to propagate in the vertical direction .",
    "@xcite included gravity in the slab model which results in the curved field lines of the kippenhahn - schlter equilibrium model .",
    "the authors found that the gravity introduces only a small shift on the normal mode frequencies and thus is not relevant in this kind of configuration .",
    "prominence fine structure consists of threads that could influence the global prominence oscillations .",
    "@xcite studied theoretically the oscillatory spectra of an isolated prominence thread .",
    "later , @xcite included this fine - structure and studied fast mhd modes of a periodic , cartesian multi - threaded model .",
    "the authors found that the modes behave as propagating modes of an homogeneous prominence with small - scale details due the fibrils .",
    "in this paper we report the observations of oscillations in a quiescent prominence observed on the limb obtained by several instruments on the ground ( themis , sac peak ) and in space ( hinode / sot ) .",
    "we describe the campaign and instrumentation in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss the observations and present the results concerning the horizontal magnetic field measured in the prominence and the transverse oscillations . in section 4",
    "we discussed a possible model to explain the observed oscillations .",
    "the observations were taken during an international campaign organized around hinode observation plan ( hop ) 219 .",
    "hinode / sot observed in h@xmath0 and in ca ii h lines between 14:04 ut and 18:09 ut . over a similar time period ( 14:17 - 19:37 ut ) the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) at sacramento peak observatory ( sac peak )",
    "was used to obtain spectra in the h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and na - d lines .",
    "themis ( `` tlescope hliographique pour l etude du magntisme et des instabilits solaires '' in canary islands ) with the mtr ( multi raies ) spectropolarimeter observed the prominence during all the day , obtaining four full data sets .",
    "the best data were collected from 10:44 - 15:30 ut .",
    "sdo / aia with the filters of 304  and 193  and stereo - a euvi at 195     are used to supply context for the observations .",
    "the themis / mtr instrument @xcite was used to do spectropolarimetry of the he d@xmath2 line in the observed prominences .",
    "the spectrograph slit was oriented parallel to the local limb .",
    "this direction defined subsequently the sign of the linear polarization : positive stokes q means parallel to the slit and , in consequence , parallel to the local limb .",
    "the double - beam polarimetry we performed required the use of a grid mask that presented us with three segments 15.5  wide along the slit , but masked regions of 17  between each slit .",
    "the masked regions allowed us to obtain a double image with opposite polarization , but it also meant that in order to get a continuous covering of the prominence along the slit we had to scan also in this direction by one step of 15 .",
    "this extraordinary scan along the slit is the reason for the jumps and dark lines in the data from this instrument presented below .",
    "these artifacts are , however , greatly compensated for by the high quality of the polarimetry produced by this observing mode .",
    "in addition to that scan along the slit a more usual scan perpendicular to the slit was made with steps of 2  from the limb to the top of the prominence .",
    "altogether typical fields of view of @xmath6 were covered in about one hour with single exposure times of 2 seconds per stokes parameter and scan position .",
    "full polarimetry with beam - exchange was done with a modulation cycle of 6 images , spanning the three stokes parameters with either positive or negative sign measured in every beam , and the simultaneous double beam measuring the opposite sign .",
    "each stokes parameter is thus measured in the same camera pixel at two different times and in two different pixels at the same time .",
    "this symmetry of measurements results in a reduction in the systematic errors to a fourth order perturbation of the signal and high quality measurements .",
    "each cycle was repeated five times to increase s / n ratios .      the hinode @xcite sot @xcite consists of a 50-cm diffraction - limited gregorian telescope and a focal plane package including the narrowband filtergraph ( nfi ) , the broadband filtergraph ( bfi ) , the stokes spectro - polarimeter , and correlation tracker ( ct ) . for this study , images were taken with a 30 sec cadence in both the h line at 3968.5    using the bfi and at line center in the h@xmath0 line at 6562.8     using the nfi .",
    "the images have a pixel size of 0.109 , with a field of view of 112@xmath7 112 , while the h@xmath0 images have a pixel size of 0.16and a field of view 164@xmath7 164 .      at the dst at sac peak we used the universal birefringent filter ( ubf ) to observe filtergrams of h@xmath0 at line center and line center @xmath8    and @xmath9   , h@xmath1 at line center and line center @xmath8    and na - d at line center and line center@xmath10   .",
    "the field of view is about @xmath11173 . in our analysis",
    "we focused on the h@xmath0 data . a full scan of the 5 h@xmath0 line positions took 10 seconds and time between images at h@xmath0 line center was 22 to 25.6 sec .",
    "pixel size is 0.17 , with resolution during our observations near 1 .",
    "the full reconstructions of the h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 profiles have not been done yet because it would require us to cross correlate the non - simultaneous images obtained in the 3 - 5 points in the profiles and then fit with a gaussian .",
    "this would allow to us to get quantitative estimates of the dopplershifts .",
    "it is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "we use only movies obtained by computing the difference of intensities of two symmetric points in the profiles , a proxy for the dopplershifts .",
    "our observations of the prominence oscillations were done from 14:00 ut -18:00 ut on 2012 oct 10 .",
    "the prominence was observed on the western limb of the sun at a position angle of about 256@xmath12 .",
    "the prominence was observed as a filament a few days before the main observations .",
    "on october 6 only two portions of the h@xmath0 filament are visible in a channel between two active regions ( figure [ fig : filament ] ) . the filament is oriented north - south along a meridian .",
    "the prominence is well observed on october 9 and 10 in sdo / aia filters . as seen in aia 304     it consists of a central pillar with arcades on both sides from which material is flowing horizontally , mostly outwards away from the central pillar in the plane of the sky ( figure [ fig : aia304 ] ) . on october 9 the central pillar",
    "is already observed in absorption as a dark region over the limb in aia/193   .",

    "we see mainly a large , broad pillar with bright , relatively narrow ( @xmath13 ) columns consisting of horizontal features and lateral extension at the top . for our measurements here we analyzed the data , although the waves were apparent in the h@xmath0 data as well .",
    "the hinode data were reduced using the standard sot reduction software ( fg - prep ) in solarsoft .",
    "the sot / ct @xcite allows fixed tracking of regions on the disk , but for regions on the limb there is a slow drift of the target through the field of view .",
    "we correct for this drift using manual corrections for large jumps associated to re - pointings and a cross correlation targeted at the limb and the side of the large scale prominence foot - point .",
    "the resulting image series is sufficiently stable that remaining jitter and drift do not affect the motions and changes measured for this paper .",

    "the result of the data reduction are cubes of spectra of the he d@xmath2 in intensity , linear polarization ( both @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) and circular polarization , for all points along the slit and all positions of the double scan .",
    "s / n ratios are better than @xmath22 at the core of the he d@xmath2 in the central parts of the prominence for all three stokes parameters . with these",
    "s / n ratios we get clear signals of linear polarization as expected ( these are a function of height above the limb , but linear polarization is expected at the level of @xmath23 times the intensity and therefore 10 times the noise level ) but circular polarization is seldom seen above the noise . whether this circular polarization is due to zeeman effect or the alignment - to - orientation transfer mechanism @xcite those low signals already point to weak magnetic fields , a conclusion that will be confirmed by the inversion codes .",
    "the stokes profiles are fed to an inversion code based on principal component analysis @xcite that efficiently compares the observed profile against those in a database generated with known models of the polarization profiles of the he d@xmath2 .",
    "the comparison is made pixel by pixel independently .",
    "the database used contains 90000 profiles computed as the emission of a single he atom in its triplet state modeled with the 5 levels of lower energy of the he triplet system .",
    "the atom is polarized by the anisotropic radiation of the photosphere below the prominence at different heights ( one of the free parameters of the model ) .",
    "collisions are not taken into account .",
    "the atomic polarization of the he atom is modified by a single vector magnetic field with free strength , inclination and azimuth .",
    "the hamiltonian of the atom includes all terms with its zeeman sublevels splitting linearly with the magnetic field .",
    "we solve the density matrix of the atom in statistical equilibrium ; the solution contains all populations and quantum coherence , including atomic alignment and orientation , for all the levels involved in the he triplet atom model .",
    "the hanle effect of every level is thus computed as well as the zeeman effect . from the resulting populations and coherence we compute the polarization dependent emission terms , in whatever direction we are observing .",
    "the scattering angle is thus a free parameter of the model too .",
    "several million profiles thus computed are used to fill the database , keeping just those which are different enough among them and rejecting others so that the database fills as homogeneously as possible the space of possible profiles while keeping at a small size .",
    "after comparison of any observed profile with those in the database , the most similar is kept as the solution and the parameters of the model used in its computation are kept as the inferred vector magnetic field , height above the photosphere and scattering angle .",
    "error bars are determined for those parameters as well by doing some statistics on all other models which are sufficiently similar to the observed ones , though not as similar as the one selected as solution .",
    "it is important to stress that although there is always one case in the database that is the most similar one to the observed one , this does not mean that it is a good fit to all of the observed profiles .",
    "it is thus important to keep a measure of how similar they are and also to check that all conclusions on the magnetic field strength or orientation are based upon sets of profiles that really correctly represent the observation .",

    "these wave modes propagate perpendicularly to the local magnetic field and the velocity perturbations are longitudinal , along the propagation direction .",
    "the restoring force of these waves are the magnetic and gas pressure , and it produces compressions and rarefactions of the plasma and the magnetic field intensity . based on the observed properties , we explore the different wave modes that could be relevant to the situation by doing a theoretical phase velocity diagram . in figure",
    "[ fig : luna ] we have plotted the sound speed , @xmath28 , the alfvn speed , @xmath29 , and the magnetosonic speed given by @xmath30 as a function of the electron number density , @xmath31 and the averaged magnetic field intensity of our observations of @xmath32 . in the range of typical prominence values of electron number density @xmath33 @xcite",
    "the plasma-@xmath1 is small and @xmath34 .",
    "our observations reveal a projected speed of the order of @xmath25 that is much smaller than the magnetosonic speeds .",
    "in fact , it is similar to @xmath28 corresponding to the slow modes .",
    "however , the slow modes propagates mainly along the magnetic field in the range of small @xmath1 , that is perpendicular to the observed direction .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed and theoretical values could be explained by the projection effect .",
    "the waves form an angle with respect to the los , @xmath35 . in the same figure [ fig : luna ]",
    "we have plotted the angle @xmath35 necessary to have a projected @xmath36 velocity of @xmath37 defined as @xmath38 .",
    "this indicates that for the range of typical prominence densities the wave moves in a direction forming an small angle with respect to the los of @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) .",
    "these angles are very extreme indicating that for typical prominence values the propagation is mainly along the los .",
    "another possibility is that the prominence electron density is larger than @xmath41 and the projection angle is small .",
    "for example with @xmath42 the magnetosonic speed is of around @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "thus , a combination of a relatively small @xmath35 and relatively large prominence density can explain the small phase speed of the observed magnetosonic waves .     and a prominence plasma temperature of @xmath45 .",
    "the typical prominence values of the electron number densities are @xmath33 ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "the dark area corresponds to larger values of @xmath31 and we have plotted this values in order to have values of the theoretical magnetosonic speed comparable to the observed velocities .",
    "we have also plotted with a dot - dashed line the @xmath38 defined as the angle should form the propagation direction of a magnetosonic wave with respect to the los in order to have a projected velocity of @xmath25 ( the observed value ) .",
    "[ fig : luna],width=377 ]      the propagating waves seem to be confined in the cool prominence column",
    ". this could be because we only observe the cool plasma in our observations , and the visibility of the waves are difficult to observe outside the cool prominence .",
    "however , theoretical models predict that the waves are truly confined in the prominence , as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors modeled the prominence as a slab of cool plasma using different configurations of the magnetic field .",
    "these systems exhibit many normal modes that are confined or trapped in the horizontal direction but propagate vertically .",
    "these works concentrated on the large wavelength limit , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the vertical wavenumber and @xmath48 is the length of the prominence field lines .",
    "in that situation the whole prominence oscillates in phase in the vertical direction .",
    "however , in the waves described in this work the wavelength is short compared with the length of the prominence magnetic field so that @xmath49 .",
    "a detailed normal mode analysis of the system is out of the scope of this paper ; it will be a subject of a future work .",
    "for the present work , we have modeled the prominence as an uniform plasma slab with a uniform horizontal magnetic field ( see figs . [",
    "fig : luna2]a and [ fig : luna2]b ) .",
    "the average magnetic field intensity is set to 7.5 gauss .",
    "we have made a time dependent simulation of the system described by @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a vertical prominence slab with a horizontal magnetic field transverse to the prominence slab .",
    "gravity is neglected because it has little influence on the waves @xcite . in this simulation",
    "we try to understand how the waves propagate in the prominence structure and not how the waves are produced and reach the prominence . for this reason we have considered the prominence slab with an infinite vertical extension and we have not modeled the photosphere , chromosphere , and transition region .",
    "the model atmosphere is uniform , the top of the photosphere is placed at @xmath50 .",
    "the driver perturbs the @xmath51-component of the velocity and consists in a planar pulse located at @xmath52 with a gaussian shape , @xmath53 .",

    "the electron density of the prominence is set to @xmath58 , @xmath59 times larger than that of the surrounding corona .",

    "[ fig : luna2]a , the wave appears from bottom .",
    "the gas pressure shows that this wave produces compressions and rarefactions of the prominence plasma .",
    "the velocity field oscillates vertically in the prominence plasma and horizontally in the corona , with the velocity in the prominence larger than that outside .",
    "the wave propagates vertically confined in the prominence body with a wave front almost planar .",
    "the motion of the plasma of the corona can be understood as follows : the coronal plasma reacts to the pressure changes of the prominence plasma .",
    "an increase of the plasma pressure in one selected position forces the coronal plasma to move away from this region along the magnetic field lines .",
    "similarly a decrease of the prominence plasma pressure forces the coronal plasma to move towards that region . in figure",
    "[ fig : luna2]b , a three - wavelengths long wave train has appeared and travels upwards . in the rear of the train",
    "a small perturbation appears with a short wavelength .",
    "these are associated with an overtone also excited by the driver .",
    "the amplitude of these small perturbation is small in comparison with the upward propagating waves .",
    "the phase speed of the upwards waves is @xmath66 , which coincides with the speed of the magnetosonic waves as we see in figure [ fig : luna ] .",
    "we have performed several numerical experiments with different configurations and in all the cases the propagation speed coincides with the magnetosonic velocity . in @xcite , the authors found that the short period oscillations are essentially trapped magnetosonic waves reflecting off the boundaries of the prominence slab and propagating along it . the normal mode excited in the simulations",
    "can be identified by the so - called string mode fif .",
    "this mode is classified as internal mode by @xcite where the velocity of the perturbation is mainly located inside the prominence .",
    "@xcite classified more accurately the normal modes of a prominence and found that the fif modes are hybrid .",
    "this means that removing the coronal or prominence medium the mode remains , but with a different frequency and shape .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that the vertically propagating waves transverse to the magnetic field are magnetosonic waves ducted along the prominence column and the treatment of waves in an homogeneous medium is applicable . the observed prominence is quiescent and seems quite static in the observed time .",
    "this indicates that the plasma @xmath1 is small and then @xmath34 and the observed waves are fast magnetosonic modes . in order to have a projected magnetosonic speed comparable to the observed velocity",
    "the projection angle @xmath67 should be small .",
    "in fact , assuming that the prominence density have a typical @xmath31 , @xmath68 .",
    "as the wave is ducted in the prominence this indicates that the column of cool plasma forms and small angle with respect to the los . this could be associated to that the column is not placed exactly at the solar limb at the moment of the observations . in figure",
    "[ fig : euvia195 ] we see that the dark pillar is considerably behind the limb .",
    "it is almost 150 arcsecs behind , that is almost @xmath69 with respect to the sun s center .",
    "this means that the local vertical to the solar surface at the pillar position is @xmath70 instead of @xmath71 with respect to the los .",
    "additionally the bright column forms part of the prominence foot or barb , and such structures are often very elongated when seen on the disk but are not very tall when seen at the limb , indicating large inclinations of those structures with respect to the solar surface . in figure",
    "[ fig : euvia195 ] we can see that the horizontal extension of the pillar is of order of 50 arcsecs , and the vertical extension is less than 50 arcsecs from figure [ fig : sot1 ] .",
    "then this means that the pillar is inclined more than @xmath72 with respect to the vertical direction .",
    "numerical simulations indicates that prominence foot consist of many horizontal thread pilled to form inclined structures with respect to the solar vertical ( see fig . 7 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : kucera ] we have included a sketch of the configuration of the pillar in the observation .",
    "the prominence foot consists in a pillar of threads that are placed in the dips of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the pillar is behind the limb ( red line ) as the observations reveal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : euvia195 ] ) .",
    "the pillar has also an inclination with respect to the local vertical .",
    "thus , it is plausible and consistent with our model that the oscillating columns form a small angle with respect to the los ( @xmath73 ) and have a relatively large density ( a few times @xmath74  @xmath75 ) .     with respect to the pillar .",
    "in the situation of a vertical pillar placed at the limb the angle is @xmath71 . the inclination of the pillar and the position behind the limb make an angle , @xmath67 which is smaller than @xmath71 .",
    "[ fig : kucera],width=340 ]    the dst observations reveals doppler velocities ( see  [ sec : dst - observations ] ) .",
    "these velocities are non - zero projections of the oscillation velocity along the los .",
    "this can be explained also by the inclination of the propagation of the waves with respect to the los . in the magnetosonic waves the oscillation and propagation direction are the same .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath76 the velocity of oscillation has a projection along the los .    along the third slit we analyzed ( slit c ) we observed downward motion , and",
    "visually it appears that some waves move upwards and then reflect back downwards .",
    "these motions can be attributed to the propagation of the waves in an non - homogeneous medium .",
    "the study of the propagation of the waves in such a complicated medium will be a subject of a future work .",
    "a quiescent prominence has been observed with hinode ( h , h@xmath0 ) , sac peak ( h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 ) over a time period of 4 hours , themis / mtr ( vector magnetograms in he d@xmath2 ) , sdo / aia ( 193   , 304   ) , and stereo - a / euvi ( 195   ) on october 10 2012 . the small field of view of the later instruments is centered on one large foot of the prominence .",
    "this foot appears in 304  , as a large quasi - vertical pillar with material flowing on each side along horizontal field lines .",
    "the polarimetry in the he d@xmath2 line obtained by the observations of themis in the mtr mode allows us to derive the magnetic field strength , the inclination and the azimuth in the region of the prominence observed .",
    "the magnetic field is mainly horizontal with a field strength around 5 -10 gauss .",
    "the observed waves propagate perpendicularly to the magnetic field according to the measurements of the magnetic field by themis .",
    "the observed phase speeds are below 10 km  s@xmath3 , the periods are around 300 s , and the wavelengths are about 2000 km .",
    "our simulations reveals that fast magnetosonic waves are ducted along the prominence foot moving upwards and probably away from the observer .",
    "these waves produce compressions and rarefactions of the plasma as the observations .",
    "the direction of the propagation are perpendicular to the magnetic field as expected .",
    "we conclude that the observed waves are fast magnetosonic waves ducted in the prominence foot .",
    "we can explain the small projected observed phase speed as a combination of a relatively small @xmath35 and relatively large prominence density .    in some cases",
    "it seems that the wavefronts propagates downwards after a reflection at some height .",
    "this could be associated with non - homogeneities of the plasma and magnetic field .",
    "however , the waves are observed emanating from the direction of the solar surface .",
    "we can not identify the driver of these waves .",
    "we speculate that they could be associated with rapid spicule jets , magnetic reconnection in the photosphere or just above , due to the emerging of small flux close to the prominence , or that the waves are associated with the characteristic 5-minutes photospheric oscillations tunneled to the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "we observe waves during the entire 4 hour period of observation .",
    "this fact could be important for the coronal heating problem because these waves contributes to the ac heating . in a future work",
    "we will investigate the propagation of the waves in non - homogeneous plasmas and how different triggers can excite these waves in prominences .",
