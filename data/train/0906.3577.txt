    "in the light - cone gauge closed nsr superstring field theory there exists the joining - splitting type cubic interaction . in order that the theory should be lorentz invariant ,",

    "these supercurrents give rise to unwanted divergences when they get close to each other .",
    "since the green - schwarz formulation is equivalent to the nsr formulation in the light - cone gauge @xcite , the same difficulty exists in the light - cone gauge string field theory of green - schwarz strings @xcite@xcite .    in order to make these theories",
    "well - defined even classically , we have to regularize these divergences and add counterterms to cancel them .",
    "the results from the supersheet approach  @xcite@xcite imply that the divergences are formally from the integration of total derivative terms over the moduli space .",
    "therefore , by choosing a good regularization , we may be able to tame the divergences .",
    "usually in the literature , point splitting type regularizations are employed . in the field theory of point particles ,",
    "the dimensional regularization is very powerful . in this paper",
    ", we therefore pursue this regularization in the light - cone gauge nsr superstring field theory to regularize the divergences of the amplitudes originating in the colliding supercurrents .    in string theory , dimensional regularization",
    "can be implemented by shifting the number of space - time dimensions , or shifting the central charge of the conformal field theory on the worldsheet . in this paper",
    ", we consider the worldsheet cft which consists of the ordinary transverse coordinate fields and a superconformal field theory with virasoro central charge @xmath2 .",
    "it is possible to construct light - cone gauge string field theory with such worldsheet cft , although it is not lorentz invariant .",
    "we study the tree amplitudes and show that this procedure actually regularizes the above mentioned divergences .",
    "the question is what kind of counterterms are needed to cancel the divergences to obtain the amplitudes which coincide with the ones derived by using the first - quantized formalism . in this paper , we examine the four - point tree amplitudes for the ns - ns closed strings and show that no counterterms are needed in this case .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we study the @xmath3-string tree amplitudes of the light - cone gauge closed string field theory for nsr superstrings with extra cft , and see that the tree amplitudes become well - defined by making the central charge @xmath2 of the cft on the worldsheet largely negative .",
    "therefore we can define the amplitudes for such @xmath2 and analytically continue @xmath2 to @xmath4 . in section [ sec : covariant ] , in order to compare the results with those of the first - quantized formalism , we rewrite the ns - ns tree amplitudes by introducing the longitudinal coordinates and the ghosts . for @xmath4 , this was done in ref .",

    "we calculate the amplitudes perturbatively , and the extra sector part in every external state of the amplitudes is always taken to be the conformal vacuum . in this paper",

    "one can find that @xmath177 can be expanded by the taylor series , and @xmath178 and @xmath179 can be expanded by the laurent series in @xmath180 , respectively .",
    "taking eq.([eq : d ] ) into account , we find that the integral of each term in the expansion behaves around @xmath181 as @xmath182 here @xmath183 and @xmath184 are integers and at least one of them is nonnegative .",
    "this contribution is finite in the limit @xmath163 .",
    "the same argument can be applied to the region @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , the second term on the right hand side of eq.([eq : amplitude-4pt2 ] ) vanishes in @xmath163 .",
    "let us turn to the integral of the third term on the right hand side of eq.([eq : amplitude-4pt2 ] ) .",
    "due to the same discussion given above , the singular contributions are of the form @xmath186 around @xmath181 for example , and we find that the possible divergence is at most @xmath187 .",
    "therefore the third term on the right hand side of eq.([eq : amplitude-4pt2 ] ) , obtained from such integrals multiplied by @xmath164 , is vanishing as @xmath163 .",
    "thus we find that the regularization prescription works in the four - point amplitudes without counterterms and the results of the first - quantized formalism are reproduced .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a dimensional regularization scheme to regularize the divergences caused by the colliding transverse supercurrents inserted at the interaction points of the three - string vertices of the light - cone gauge superstring field theory .",
    "we have investigated the tree amplitudes and shown that the divergences originating in the colliding supercurrents are actually regularized .",
    "we have explicitly studied the four - point amplitudes of the ns - ns closed strings , and shown that the usual results are reproduced without any counterterms in this case .",
    "although the amplitudes without the ramond strings have been considered , we can treat the amplitudes including them in a similar way .",
    "there are many problems that remain to be studied .",
    "we should go on and examine the tree amplitudes with @xmath188 and then the higher - loop amplitudes , and see if we need counterterms to reproduce the desired results . in these cases , there are situations in which more than two interaction points approach one another , which makes the integrations over the moduli spaces more complicated .",
    "if it is difficult to treat the amplitudes directly , it may be better to pursue other approaches . in the dimensional regularization ,",
    "we shift the space - time dimension away from the critical dimension .",
    "the light - cone gauge string field theory in such a space - time is not lorentz invariant .",
    "however , since the light - cone gauge string field theory is a gauge fixed theory , it will be possible to find a lorentz noninvariant but gauge invariant theory whose gauge fixed version coincides with such a noncritical string theory .",
    "if such a theory exists , the form of the possible counterterms will be severely restricted .",
