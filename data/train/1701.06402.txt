    "a regular black hole solution with a lens space topology , at present , has not been found to the five - dimensional vacuum einstein equation , although a few authors have attempted to construct such a black lens solution by using the combination of the rod diagram and the inverse scattering method  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a new development in this field .",
    "asymptotically flat and stationary black lens solutions , whose horizon topology is restricted to @xmath6 , were constructed by kunduri and lucietti as supersymmetric solutions to the five - dimensional minimal ungauged supergravity  @xcite and @xmath7 supergravity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the more general black lenses with the horizon topologies of @xmath8 were also constructed by one of the present authors in the former theory  @xcite .",

    "such an asymptotically flat , static multi - black hole solution was perviously generalized to higher dimensional einstein - maxwell theories   @xcite .",

    ", these solutions generalized to higher dimensions do not admit smoothness of the metric at horizons , whereas for the concentric multi - black ring solution   @xcite , the spacetime is known to be analytic at each event horizon .",
    "therefore , it is not entirely clear whether there does exist a regular multi - black lens solution in higher dimensions , simply because a black lens solution with a single horizon exists .    the purpose of this paper is to construct an exact solution describing an arbitrary number of charged rotating black lenses with smooth horizons as an asymptotically flat and stationary supersymmetric solution in five - dimensional minimal supergravity .",

    "we show that by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the parameters , the @xmath9 point sources denote degenerate killing horizons with the topologies of different lens spaces @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , introducing an appropriate coordinate system , we also show that the metric and maxwell s field strength are smooth on each horizon in contrast to the higher dimensional majumdar - papapetrou solutions and multi - bmpv black hole solution .",
