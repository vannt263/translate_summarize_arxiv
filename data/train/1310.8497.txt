    "the convective motion of enclosed fluids is of fundamental interest , as well as being present in a variety of engineering , geophysical , and astrophysical systems .",
    "a paradigmatic model that has been widely used to study this type of flow is rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) convection ( ahlers , grossmann @xmath7 lohse 2009 ; lohse @xmath7 xia 2010 ) , i.e. a fluid layer heated from below and cooled on the top .",
    "a central issue in the study of rb system is to understand how heat is transported upwards across the fluid layer by convective flows @xcite .",
    "it is usually measured in terms of the nusselt number @xmath2 @xmath8 , which depends on the control parameters of the system , such as the rayleigh number @xmath6 @xmath9 and the prandtl number @xmath3 @xmath10 . here",
    ", @xmath11 is the heat current density across the fluid layer of thermal conductivity @xmath12 with height @xmath13 and with an applied temperature difference @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the acceleration due to gravity , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are , respectively , the thermal expansion coefficient , kinematic viscosity , and thermal diffusivity of the working fluid . specifically , the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath2 has long been studied ( kraichnan 1962 ; verzicco @xmath7 camussi 1999 ; kerr @xmath7 herring 2000 ; ahlers @xmath7 xu 2001 ; grossmann @xmath7 lohse 2001 ; xia , lam @xmath7 zhou 2002 ; roche _ et al .",

    "_ 2012 , 2013 ) , especially in three - dimensional ( 3d ) cylindrical samples .",
    "it is found that for moderate @xmath6 , with increasing prandtl number , @xmath2 first increases , reaches its maximum value at around @xmath19 ( depends on @xmath6 ) , and then slightly decreases @xcite . for higher @xmath6",
    ", @xmath2 seems to become independent of @xmath3 @xcite .    in the field of convection , two - dimensional ( 2d ) rb flow",
    "has played an important role ( zhang @xmath7 wu 2005 ; zhang , wu @xmath7 xia 2005 ) , partly because its relevance to thermal convection occurring in the atmosphere @xcite . recently ,",
    "2d convection was also utilized as a test - bed to study the physical and turbulent transport features of 3d convection , e.g. , it was adopted to compare turbulent heat transport between conditions of constant temperature and constant heat flux @xcite , to reveal the non - boussinesq effects on the flow organization @xcite , to analyze the reversals of the large - scale circulation ( lsc ) @xcite , to study the boundary layer ( bl ) dynamics @xcite , and to connect the flow structures and heat flux ( van der poel , stevens @xmath7 lohse , 2011 ; van der poel _",
    "moreover , many heat - transfer theories for turbulent rb system are essentially 2d , e.g. the grossmann - lohse theory @xcite and the whitehead - doering theory for the ultimate regime @xcite . in general , 2d geometry offers two advantages : ( i ) the numerical effort for 2d simulations is much smaller so that a full resolution of the bls at high rayleigh numbers can be guaranteed ; ( ii ) the flow visualizations of the full temperature and velocity fields are much easier so that a direct connection between the flow organization and the heat - transfer properties is possible .",
    "nevertheless , we note that there is still lack of systematic studies on the heat - transfer properties in 2d rb convection , such as the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath2 . in this paper",
    ", we will fill this gap with the help of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) .",
    "the simulations were made over the ranges @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we show that heat transfer of 2d rb flow for not too large @xmath6 exhibits a very different @xmath3-dependence from the 3d cylindrical case , i.e. @xmath4 minimizes , rather than maximizes as in 3d case , around @xmath5 .",
    "we further show that such a behavior is due to counter - gradient heat transport generated by the competitions between the corner - flow rolls and the lsc .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "@xmath222 introduces the numerical method adopted in the present paper .",
    "the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath2 is discussed in @xmath223 , where we try to establish a direct connection between the flow structures and the @xmath2-@xmath3 behaviors .",
    "we summarize our findings and conclude in @xmath224 .",
    "we deal with a wall - bounded 2d domain of height @xmath23 and horizontal length @xmath24 with uniform grids . the numerical code is based on a compact fourth - order finite difference scheme of the time - dependent incompressible oberbeck - boussinesq equations in vorticity - stream function formulation , i.e. @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the velocity field ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the horizontal and vertical unit vectors , respectively ) , @xmath32 is the vorticity , @xmath33 is the stream function , and @xmath34 is the temperature .",
    "the scheme was proposed by liu , wang @xmath7 johnston ( 2003 ) and the accuracy , stability , and efficiency of the scheme have been examined in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the global quantities , such as @xmath2 , obtained using the compact scheme agree well with those obtained using other numerical schemes , such as the fourier - chebyshev spectral collocation method @xcite .",
    "recently , we have applied the same numerical code to study small - scale properties in 2d rayleigh - taylor turbulence @xcite . here",
    "we briefly describe the scheme . for equations ( [ eq : ns_omega])-([eq : uw ] ) , an essentially compact fourth - order ( ec4 ) scheme , first proposed by @xcite for the 2d navier - stokes equations , is employed to solve the momentum equations with the gravity term treated explicitly . @xcite",
    "have shown that the ec4 scheme has very nice features with regard to the treatment of boundary conditions .",
    "such a scheme is also very efficient , because at each runge - kutta stage only two poisson - like equations have to be solved by taking the standard fast fourier transform based poisson solvers .",
    "the heat transfer equation ( [ eq : ns_t ] ) is treated as a standard convection - diffusion equation and is discretized using fourth - order long - stencil difference operators .",
    "third - order runge - kutta method is employed to integrate the equations in time .",
    "the time step is chosen to fulfill the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) conditions , i.e. , the cfl number is 0.2 or less for all computations presented in this paper .",
    "the grid resolution has been chosen to achieve a full resolution of the bls @xcite and to resolve the smallest scale of the problem , i.e. the kolmogorov scale @xmath35 and the batchelor scale @xmath36 . in the present study ,",
    "the number of grid points is increased from @xmath37 to @xmath38 as @xmath6 increases from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "thus , for all runs the thermal bls are resolved with at least 18 grid points and the grid spacings @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "no - penetration and no - slip velocity boundary conditions are applied to all four solid walls , which are recast in terms of @xmath33 as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . for temperature the two vertical sidewalls ( @xmath46 )",
    "are chosen to be adiabatic ( no flux ) , while at the colder top ( @xmath47 ) and the warmer bottom ( @xmath48 ) plates , the temperature are fixed at @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , and thus the temperature difference across the fluid layer is @xmath51 and the mean bulk temperature , i.e. the arithmetic mean value of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , is @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ fig : fignura ] ( _ a _ ) shows a log - log plot of the measured @xmath2 as a function of @xmath6 for eight values of @xmath3 . for clarity",
    ", the data set for each @xmath3 has been shifted upwards from its lower neighbor by a factor of 1.3 . here , @xmath2 is calculated over the whole volume and over a very large averaging time , e.g. more than 1000@xmath55 ( 400@xmath55 ) for @xmath56 ( @xmath40 ) , where @xmath57 is the large eddy turnover times with @xmath58 being the center vorticity . the time convergence for the obtained @xmath2 is checked by comparing the time - averages over the first and the last halves of the simulation and the resulting convergence is for most cases smaller than @xmath59 . in the figure",
    ", we note that the @xmath2-@xmath6 data for each @xmath3 could be well described by the power - law relation , @xmath60 ( see the solid lines in the figure ) . the best - fitted scaling exponent @xmath61 and prefactor @xmath62 as functions of @xmath3",
    "are plotted in figure [ fig : fignura ] ( _ b _ ) and ( _ c _ ) , respectively , and one can see that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 vary slightly with @xmath3 .",
    "we further notice that the obtained scaling exponents @xmath61 are in general agreement with those found in 3d convection cells @xcite , while the values of @xmath62 are smaller than their 3d counterparts .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we show the compensated @xmath63 as a function of @xmath3 for five values of @xmath6 .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath64 , with increasing @xmath3 , @xmath2 first decreases , reaches its minimum value at @xmath5 , and then increases .",
    "this is dramatically different from the 3d cylindrical case , where @xmath2 is found to maximize at @xmath19 for moderate @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is further seen that the effect of the @xmath3 number on the heat transfer reduces with increasing @xmath6 , i.e. , the variations in @xmath4 , as defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum in the nusselt number series , yield @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 for @xmath56 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , respectively . for @xmath70",
    "the observed @xmath3-dependence is qualitatively similar to that of the 3d cylindrical case .    to understand the anomalous @xmath2-@xmath3 relation in 2d case , we then study the instantaneous flow structures and try to reveal the connection between the heat - transfer properties and the flow organization .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2](_a _ ) shows a typical snapshot of the temperature and velocity fields .",
    "corresponding video can be viewed as supplementary material .",
    "one can see clearly that the dominant flow pattern is a counter - clockwise rotating roll orientated diagonally in the cell .",
    "there are still several smaller secondary rolls at the corners of the cell : two larger clockwise rotating rolls at the lower - left and upper - right corners .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the corner rolls are energetically fed by thermal plumes detaching from the bls .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2](_b _ ) shows the corresponding snapshot of the local heat flux field , @xmath71 .",
    "it is surprising that there exist strong negative ( i.e. opposite to the temperature gradient of the system ) @xmath72 with magnitude much larger than the global heat transport of the system ( @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) . from the movie corresponding to figure [ fig : fig2 ] two mechanisms for generating counter - gradient local heat transport",
    "can be identified : ( i ) hot plumes detach from the bottom thermal bl and move upwards with the lsc . after reaching the other plate",
    ", some plumes do not lost their thermal energy completely , i.e. they are still hotter than the environment .",
    "these plumes continue moving with the lsc , leading to the sinking of the hot fluids and thus generating negative @xmath72 .",
    "the same process can be observed for cold plumes detached from the top plate .",
    "this kind of counter - gradient heat transport is due to the bulk dynamics and was also observed in previous 3d rb experiments @xcite .",
    "( ii ) when hot plumes move upwards with the lower - left corner rolls , they encounter with the lsc . on the one hand , the corner rolls grow in kinetic energy and thus also in size due to the energy gained from detaching plumes from thermal bls . on the other hand ,",
    "the growth of the sizes of the corner rolls is suppressed by the lsc .",
    "therefore , the corner - flow rolls and the lsc compete with each other . because the strength of the corner rolls is smaller than that of the lsc",
    ", these hot plumes are forced to fall back and thus leading to the negative @xmath72 .",
    "the same process can also be observed for cold plumes in the upper - right corner rolls .",
    "this kind of counter - gradient heat transport is due to the competitions between the corner rolls and the lsc . taken together , therefore , both the lsc and the corner flows sometines contribute to heat transport in the ` wrong direction ' : cold fluids can be brought back to the cold plate and hot fluids can be brought back to the hot plate by either the corner flows or the lsc .    to quantify these two kinds of negative @xmath72 , we note that the steamlines of the stream function @xmath76 can roughly distinguish the regions of the corner rolls and the lsc [ see solid lines in figure [ fig : fig2](_b _ ) ]",
    ". then the counter - gradient heat flux due to the bulk dynamics , @xmath77 , and that due to the corner - lsc competitions , @xmath78 , are calculated via conditional average as @xmath79 and @xmath80 figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath2 , @xmath78 , and @xmath77 for @xmath74 . while the magnitude of @xmath77 increases at increasing @xmath3 , @xmath78",
    "is seen to share the similar @xmath3-dependence as the global @xmath2 , suggesting , from our point of view , that the observed anomalous 2d @xmath2-@xmath3 relation could be attributed to the corner - lsc competitions",
    ". note that while there is strong negative @xmath72 with magnitude much larger than the global @xmath2 , the averaged @xmath77 and @xmath78 are smaller in magnitude than the global @xmath2 , suggesting this average could be controlled by a few strong events .",
    "the next issue is to physically understand the @xmath3-behaviors of @xmath78 and @xmath77 . for @xmath77 , with decreasing @xmath3 ( i.e. increasing thermal diffusivity ) , plumes become much easier to lost their thermal energy through thermal diffusion , thus resulting in the decrease of the magnitude of @xmath77 . for @xmath78 , the magnitude of @xmath78",
    "is related to the strength of the corner flow : stronger corner flows contain more thermal energy , and thus lead to the increase of the magnitude of @xmath78 after they are forced to move back by the corner - lsc competitions . as argued by @xcite , the buildup of the corner flow",
    "is suppressed for too small and too large @xmath3 .",
    "this is because that for too small @xmath3 , as discussed above , the thermal energy carried by plumes is lost through thermal diffusion and for too large @xmath3 the thermal coupling between the corner flow and the thermal bl is hindered as the thermal bl is nested in the kinematic bl @xcite .",
    "therefore , the strength of the corner flow is expected to become strongest and thus the magnitude of @xmath78 is maximal at some moderate @xmath3 , which is in consistent with the results shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig : fig3 ] .    to quantify the strength of the corner flow , we follow the idea of @xcite and adopt the height @xmath81 of the corner flow , which can be measured by identifying the position of the steepest gradient of @xmath82 at the respective sidewall .",
    "figures [ fig : fig4](_a_)-(_c _ ) show the @xmath3-dependence of the time - averaged heights @xmath83 of the lower corner flows for @xmath84 , @xmath68 , and @xmath85 , respectively . in the figures , we also plot the compensated @xmath63 for comparison . it is seen that @xmath83 is highly anti - correlated with @xmath2 for @xmath6 between @xmath39 and @xmath69 , i.e. there is an optimal @xmath5 for which @xmath83 is maximal .",
    "this again suggests that for moderate @xmath6 stronger corner flows restrain the global heat flux of the system via the corner - lsc competitions .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4](_d _ ) shows @xmath83 and @xmath63 as functions of @xmath3 for @xmath86 .",
    "we find that when @xmath87 the corner - flow rolls are not stable and would detach from the corners ( see figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) and hence it is hard to identify the corner - flow rolls and quantify their heights for these flow organizations .",
    "for @xmath88 , @xmath83 and @xmath2 are found to be uncorrelated , which may be due to that for high @xmath6 thermal mixing is enhanced by the increased turbulent intensity and hence the negative @xmath72 generated by the corner - lsc competitions is not so pronounced as that in moderate-@xmath6 cases .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that the corner - flow rolls do not play an important role in the processes of turbulent heat transport for high @xmath6 .",
    "in conclusion , our high - resolution numerical measurements of @xmath2 in 2d rb convection over the parameter ranges @xmath20 and @xmath21 show that @xmath4 minimizes at @xmath89 for moderate @xmath6 .",
    "this is dramatically different from the observations in 3d cylindrical cells , where the opposite situation is found , i.e. @xmath4 maximizes near @xmath90 for not too large @xmath6 .",
    "we find that such a difference is attributed to the counter - gradient local heat flux generated by the competitions between the corner - flow rolls and the lsc , the effects of which are more pronounced in 2d geometry .",
    "what we want to emphasize is that although the present analysis is performed in 2d geometry , counter - gradient local heat transport is ubiquitous and it can also be found in 3d turbulent rb system @xcite .",
    "however , due to the fluid motion in the third dimensionality , the effects of counter - gradient transport in 3d cases are not strong enough to reverse the global heat flux and make it go through a minimum as observed in 2d situations .",
    "the effects of counter - gradient heat transfer on the dynamic and global - heat - transfer processes in 3d geometry will be the objectives of our future studies .",
