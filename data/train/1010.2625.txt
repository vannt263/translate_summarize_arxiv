    "the theoretical description of odd - mass nuclei is a difficult task in mean field models and , for that reason , they have been much less studied than the corresponding even - even systems although they roughly constitute half of the existing nuclides .",
    "the properties of odd nuclei are however relevant , for example , to understand odd - even effects related to pairing correlations , as well as to constrain nuclear energy density functionals ( edfs ) aiming to reach a reasonable spectroscopic quality . within this context , the energies , spins and parities of the ( neutron and/or proton ) multi - quasiparticle excitations are basic pieces of information to get insight into the underlying nuclear structure .",
    "thus , the interest in the properties of odd-@xmath0 nuclei and their computational challenges have been lately revived @xcite .",
    "one of the main technical difficulties in the description of odd nuclei is that the ( exact ) blocking procedure @xcite requires the breaking of time - reversal invariance making the calculations troublesome . moreover , since blocking does depend on the choice of the alignment orientation , for each quasiparticle excitation reorientation effects should also be considered @xcite retaining in each case the solution with the lowest energy .",
    "therefore , in order to reduce the computational cost , in practical applications it is convenient to preserve time - reversal as selfconsistent symmetry . this has been traditionally accomplished within the so called equal filling approximation ( efa ) , according to which the odd nucleon is half into a given orbital and half into its time - reversed partner .",
    "the microscopic justification of the efa is based on standard ideas of quantum statistical mechanics and has been considered in ref .",
    "the predictions arising from various treatments of blocking have been compared in ref .",
    "@xcite . on one hand",
    ", it has been shown that both exact blocking and efa approach are strictly equivalent when the time - odd fields of the edf are neglected .",
    "on the other hand , it has also been concluded that the efa is sufficiently precise for most practical applications .",
    "the efa is precisely the approximation employed in the present work to study the systematics of the ground and low - lying one - quasineutron states in odd-@xmath0 nuclei with proton ( neutron ) numbers @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the local systematics of one - quasiparticle excitations have already been studied in various mass regions either from macroscopic - microscopic approaches @xcite or from the edf theory @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , still the only global study of odd - nuclei within the nuclear edf framework has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where skyrme - hf+bcs predictions for ground - state spins and parities have been compared with finite - range droplet model results .",
    "as already mentioned , in this work we study neutron - rich sr , zr , and mo odd isotopes with mass numbers @xmath3 .",
    "nuclei in this region of the nuclear chart are being actively studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite because of their interest from the nuclear structure perspective , as well as because of their significance in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "in particular , their masses and decay properties are an essential input to model the path , the isotopic abundances and the time scale of the r process in a reliable way @xcite . in addition , this region is also characterized by the strong competition between various shapes , giving rise to shape instabilities that lead to shape coexistence and sudden shape transitions @xcite .",
    "thus , it is interesting to explore the predictive power of the gogny - edf @xcite when applied to describe the ground and low - lying one - quasineutron states in odd-@xmath0 nuclear systems belonging to this region .",
    "although it is clear that one can not expect _ a priori _ to reproduce in detail spectroscopic properties of the considered odd-@xmath0 nuclei from global edfs ( see , for example , @xcite ) the question still remains about the ability of the gogny - type edfs to describe , at least qualitatively , the main features of the observed trends in the sr , zr and mo isotopic chains .",
    "in addition to d1s @xcite , which is the most standard and thoroughly tested parameter set ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) , in the present study we have also considered the most recent parametrization of the gogny - edf , namely the d1 m @xcite parametrization . the goal is twofold , first we want to verify the robustness of our predictions with respect to the particular version of the edf employed . if the results with two different edfs ( or two parametrizations of one , as is our case ) are similar , we can be rather confident about the independence of the predictions with respect to the details of the edf .",
    "the second goal is to test the performance of d1 m in the present context ( spectroscopy of odd-@xmath0 nuclei ) as to add arguments to decide whether d1 m @xcite can supersede the rather old d1s @xcite parametrization or not .",
    "the fitting protocol of d1 m includes input from a realistic equation of state ( eos ) both in symmetric and neutron nuclear matter .",
    "it also explores , in the symmetric nuclear matter eos case , the four possible spin - isospin channels and tries to reproduce the trends obtained in realistic brueckner - hartree - fock calculations . as a consequence",
    ", the d1 m parametrization reproduces the correct sign for the isovector splitting of the effective mass for neutron - rich matter at all possible asymmetries .",
    "the consequence of such a sophisticated fitting protocol is an energy root mean square deviation for the experimentally known 2149 masses of only 0.8 mev which is much better than the one of d1s .",
    "the systematic comparison @xcite of the collective @xmath4 excitation energies obtained with d1s and d1 m ( only even - even nuclei were considered ) suggests that the later essentially keeps the same nuclear structure predictive power of the former .",
    "subsequent analysis centered on the structure of the intrinsic wave functions @xcite has confirmed the previous findings .",
    "therefore , it is timely and necessary to further extend the comparison between d1s and d1 m to odd nuclei . to this end",
    ", we analyze in the present paper the spectroscopic properties of neutron - rich sr , zr and mo odd isotopes in the @xmath3 mass region within the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) @xcite plus efa framework @xcite ( hfb - efa ) .",
    "the election of the considered nuclei is mainly driven by the intense experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite efforts to better characterize the structural evolution of the ground and excited nuclear shapes in this region of the nuclear chart @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "finally , sec .",
    "[ conclu ] is devoted to the concluding remarks and work perspectives .",
    "in the present study several sr , zr and mo isotopes with odd neutron number are studied .",
    "nevertheless , the blocking procedure changing the number parity @xcite of a given even - even hfb vacuum and providing us with the corresponding ground and low - lying one - quasiparticle states in odd-@xmath0 nuclei also requires to consider even - a nuclei in these isotopic chains , as discussed below .    in previous studies of even - even nuclei",
    "we have found advantageous to use the so called gradient method @xcite to obtain the solution of the hfb equations , leading to the ( even number parity ) vacuum @xmath5 . within this method , the hfb equation is recast in terms of a minimization ( variational ) process of the mean field energy and the thouless parameters defining the most general hfb wave functions @xcite are used as variational parameters . for a given point in the multidimensional variational space of the thouless",
    "parameters the procedure uses the direction of the gradient in its search for the minimum .",
    "the advantage of the gradient method over others , like the successive iteration method , relies on the way constraints are implemented , which allows a larger number of them to be treated at once .",
    "as it is customary in calculations with the gogny force , the kinetic energy of the center of mass motion has been subtracted from the routhian to be minimized in order to ensure that the center of mass is kept at rest .",
    "the exchange coulomb energy was considered in the slater approximation and we neglected the contribution of the coulomb interaction to the pairing field .",
    "both axial and time - reversal are selfconsistent symmetries in our calculations .",
    "the quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 associated with a given ( even - even ) hfb vacuum @xmath5 have been expanded in an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis @xmath8    @xmath9    containing enough number of shells ( 13 major shells ) to grant convergence for all values considered of the mass quadrupole moment @xmath10 @xcite and for all the nuclei studied .",
    "constrained calculations have been performed to generate pecs for even - even sr , zr and mo nuclei .",
    "such pecs are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_pec ] for a set of representative isotopes and the parametrization gogny - d1s .",
    "one can also find a systematic compilation of pecs obtained with gogny - d1s in ref .",
    "the computation of such pecs is twofold : first , they give us initial hints on the evolution of the different competing shapes in the considered nuclei and , second , they provide a whole set of prolate , spherical and oblate ( reference ) even - even hfb states for the subsequent treatment of the neighboring odd-@xmath11 nuclei .    52 , 56 , 60 , 64 , and 68 obtained from hfb calculations with the gogny - d1s energy density functional.,width=302 ]    in fact ,",
    "once a reference ( even - even ) state with a given deformation is chosen , we use it to perform an additional ( constrained ) hfb calculation providing an unblocked fully - paired state corresponding to an odd average neutron number ( false vacuum @xcite ) with the same deformation .",
    "such prolate , spherical and oblate false vacua are then used as input configurations in our subsequent blocking scheme ( i.e. , efa ) .    the hfb ground - state wave function @xmath12 of an even - even nucleus",
    "is defined by the condition of being the vacuum of the annihilation quasiparticle operators @xmath13 defined in eq .",

    "leaves both @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( and therefore any mean value ) unaltered whereas the quasiparticle operators are affected by the representation of the unitary transformation in operator space .",
    "this invariance is not maintained in the odd-@xmath0 case , as we will discuss below , implying conceptual changes in the treatment of an odd-@xmath0 system as compared to the simpler even - even case .",

    "[ intro ] , one of our aims in the present study was to further extend the comparison , already undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite , between the performance of the parametrizations gogny - d1s and gogny - d1 m to the description of the spectroscopy of odd-@xmath0 nuclei .",
    "therefore , in fig . [ sr_comp ] ( for @xmath84sr ) , fig .",
    "[ zr_comp ] ( for @xmath97zr ) and fig .",
    "[ mo_comp ] ( for @xmath132mo ) , we compare the results obtained for the low - lying one - quasineutron states using these two different incarnations of the gogny - edf with the experimental data .",
    "first , one realizes the nice similarity between the hfb - efa predictions obtained with these two parametrizations .",
    "in particular , the predicted ground states coincide in most of the cases and agree well with experiment . only in mo isotopes",
    "one observes some disagreement but in this case , we obtain a high density of very low - lying configurations with the observed ground states always below 0.2 mev .    ,",
    "but for mo isotopes.,width=302 ]    looking at the figures in more detail , we can see that within the considered energy window of 0.7 mev , practically the same states are obtained from the calculations with d1s and d1 m .",
    "this is especially true for prolate deformed states .",
    "for example , in sr isotopes ( fig .",
    "[ sr_comp ] ) we obtain the same @xmath98 states in @xmath89sr as well as the @xmath111 and @xmath81 states in @xmath87sr very close to the experiment and with very small variations ( less than 0.2 mev ) from one edf to another .",
    "the same happens in fig .",
    "[ zr_comp ] for the zr isotopes .",
    "the prolate states @xmath98 ( in @xmath87zr ) and @xmath111 , @xmath81 ( in @xmath90zr ) are predicted very close with d1s and d1 m and agree well with experiment .",
    "however , we observe an enhanced sensitivity in the case of the oblate configurations , resulting in lower energies , of the order of a few hundred kev , in the case of d1 m with respect to d1s .",
    "this is a consequence of having closer oblate and prolate minima with the parametrization d1 m .",
    "the ground states are nicely reproduced .    in the case of mo isotopes ( fig .",
    "[ mo_comp ] ) the experimental ground and first excited state are interchanged in @xmath90mo and @xmath95mo .",
    "our hfb - efa calculations provide prolate @xmath111 and @xmath98 states compatible with experiment , but also other oblate configurations at very low excitation energy .",
    "we can see @xmath116 , @xmath111 , @xmath79 , and @xmath81 low - lying oblate states in @xmath90mo .",
    "in addition to those we also find an oblate @xmath133 state in @xmath95mo . as for zr isotopes , we also find that d1 m tends to favor oblate solutions , which appear displaced to lower energies with respect to the prolate solutions in d1s .",
    "in general we obtain a comparable spectroscopic quality of the two gogny parametrizations and it is very satisfying to observe how the new parametrization d1 m , in spite of the relaxation of some of the original constraints in its fitting protocol and more oriented to reproducing nuclear masses @xcite , still follows very closely the fine details predicted with gogny - d1s for odd-@xmath0 nuclei in a region of the nuclear chart with such a challenging shape evolution .",
    "in this work we have studied the systematics of one - quasineutron configurations in odd-@xmath0 sr , zr and mo isotopes within the selfconsistent hfb plus efa framework , an approach that has been shown to be fairly adequate for most purposes .",
    "however , we are aware of the challenge of reproducing in detail the observed spectroscopic properties in the particular mass region considered in the present study .",
    "therefore , our aim has been to understand qualitatively the structural evolution of the ground and low - lying one quasiparticle configurations with neutron number .",
    "we have also shown that the quality of the spectroscopic results obtained with the recent d1 m parametrization of the gogny force is comparable to the one obtained with the standard parametrization d1s .",
    "we conclude that both d1 m and d1s parametrizations reproduce , at least qualitatively , the main features observed in the isotopic ( and isotonic ) trends of the neutron - rich and odd-@xmath0 sr , zr and mo nuclei .    the main deficiency of our mean field description is the preservation of axial symmetry . we have found this to be relevant in nuclei characterized by shallow minima around the spherical configurations like in the @xmath11=55 - 59 isotopes , as well as in those nuclei with some tendency to @xmath120-soft behavior or even triaxial minima like in the heavier mo isotopes @xcite .",
    "a beyond mean - field treatment seems to be necessary to improve the quality of the description in those cases , and configuration mixing calculations in the spirit of the generator - coordinate - method ( gcm ) method @xcite may be required to improve the mean - field results .",
    "we are still far from being able to apply such a configuration mixing approach within an exact blocking scheme for odd nuclei .",
    "nevertheless , a hfb - efa - gcm scheme can be considered as a plausible step forward in this direction and work along this lines is in progress .",
