    "nb@xmath0al has advantages of better tolerance to strain / stress for stoichiometric composition over nb@xmath0sn . the rapid - heating , quenching and transformation annealing ( rhq ) process enables to form a stoichiometric nb@xmath0al with fine grain structures via metastable bcc supersaturated - solid - solution . as a result a large critical current density of rhq - nb@xmath3l is achieved over the whole range of magnetic fields .",
    "the rhq - nb@xmath0al conductor is very promising for high - field applications such as particle accelerator , fusion reactor , and nmr .",
    "development of the rhq - nb@xmath0al wires has been reported by takeuchi @xmath4 @xmath5[1 - 5 ] .",
    "the critical current @xmath6 of a15-type superconducting wires such as nb@xmath0al and nb@xmath0sn dependent on the tensile strain .",
    "banno @xmath4 @xmath5 reported that @xmath6 of rhq - nb@xmath0al wires decreases with an increase in the tensile strain@xcite .",
    "since rhq - nb@xmath0al wires are composites , thermal phase stress during sample preparation ( heat treatment ) can be generated due to difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) among constituent phases .",
    "the thermal stresses are also different for samples with different matrix . at the room temperature ,",
    "the nb@xmath0al filament has residual strain induced by the difference in the thermal contraction between the filament and the matrix material during cool - down from the heat treatment to the room temperature .",
    "it is important to study the residual strain of rhq - nb@xmath0al to thoroughly understand its @xmath7 dependence on the strain , but it has not been studied yet .",
    "the cte of nb@xmath0al is smaller than that of cu and larger than that of ta or nb@xcite .",
    "therefore , the residual strain of nb@xmath0al filament is determined by the complicated interaction with the compressive and the tensile stresses by the cu stabilizer and the ta or nb matrix . to understand the mechanism of generation of the residual strain in rhq - nb@xmath0al wires , it is necessary to investigate the effect of each component . in this study , we focused on the dependence of this residual strain on the matrix structure at room temperature .",
    "for this purpose , the cu plating was removed after heat treatment for nb@xmath0al phase transformation .",
    "residual strain of nb@xmath0sn in bronze processed nb@xmath0sn wire has been estimated to be about -0.2  -0.1%  at the room temperature by a single - peak analysis in the axial direction@xcite .",
    "the residual strain of nb@xmath0sn was shown to have a significant effect by cu .",
    "the cte of nb@xmath0sn is smaller than that of cu by 9.6 @xmath8 10@xmath9 k@xmath10 .",
    "this difference is about four times larger than the difference between the ctes of nb@xmath0al and ta ( or nb ) in non - cu nb@xmath0al wires . considering only the magnitude of strain in the axial direction ,",
    "the residual strain of nb@xmath0al filament in the rhq - nb@xmath0al wires was expected to be smaller than that of nb@xmath0sn in the bronze processed nb@xmath0sn wires .",
    "thus , high precision is necessary for analyzing the residual strain in rhq - nb@xmath0al wires .",
    "we prepared three types of the rhq - nb@xmath0al wire samples without cu stabilizer and with different matrix materials ( samples a , b , and c ) .",
    "main parameters are summarized as shown in table [ t_m ] .",
    "the cross section of sample a is shown in fig .",
    "[ crosssection ] .",
    "the following is the sample preparation process .",
    "firstly , a mono filament was prepared by the jelly - roll method@xcite .",
    "nb and al sheets with a stoichiometric composition were rolled onto a pure nb or a pure ta core .",
    "the mono filament was bundled into a cu conduit with ta or nb matrix , and a multi filament was fabricated by the wire drawing process .",
    "after drawing the wires , the cu conduit was removed , and they were heated to above 2000 @xmath11c by rhq treatment .",
    "then , the cu stabilizer was plated .",
    "the cross - sectional diameter of the drawn wires was 1 mm , and they were heated at 800 @xmath11c for 10 h. finally , the cu plating was removed .    to determine the residual strain of the nb@xmath0al filament in the composite , a sample representing a strain - free state is necessary .",
    "since removal of the ta or nb matrix surrounding the nb@xmath0al filament is very difficult , the samples a , b and c were powderized .",
    "the powder samples were prepared with a particle size below 0.02 mm to achieve a strain - free state .",
    ".specification of samples a , b , and c. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the calculation results for residual strain are shown in fig .",
    "[ strain_cross ] . in sample c ,",
    "the calculation results for nb@xmath0al filament and ta , which was similar to result obtained by multi - peak analysis . in sample a , residual strain obtained by the model calculation was less than that obtained by the multi - peak analysis for the nb@xmath0al filament and the former was larger than the latter for the ta .",
    "this indicates that the strain mechanism for the all - ta matrix is different from that for the all - nb matrix in axial direction .",
    "considering the different strain mechanism of samples a and c in transverse direction , it may be related to effect from the transverse direction due to the high hardness of the ta and the complicated structure of cross section .",
    "al and the matrix material.,width=307 ]",
    "the residual strains for nb@xmath0al filament and matrix materials in rhq - nb@xmath0al wires were measured by neutron diffraction at room temperature .",
    "we have estimated the lattice constants @xmath12 for three types wires by multi - peak analysis having anisotropic lattice strains in axial and transverse directions of wire , due to the different diffraction elastic stiffness in lattice planes , and the sample configuration .",
    "the multi - peak analysis showed good accuracy in the estimation of residual strain in rhq - nb@xmath0al wires .",
    "we have estimated the tensile residual strain of the nb@xmath0al filament and the compressive strain of the ta and nb in the axial direction , by analyzing the lattice constant @xmath12 . by comparing the all - nb matrix and the composite matrix samples , the residual strains is greatly affected by the type of inter - filament material .",
    "we also obtained the difference in the residual strain of nb@xmath0al filament between the all - ta matrix and all - nb matrix samples in the rhq - nb@xmath0al wires , and the residual strains were calculated by thermal strain model in axial direction .",
    "result , the all - ta matrix and the all - nb matrix samples showed different strain mechanisms in the axial and transverse direction .",
