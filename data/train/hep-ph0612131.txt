    "the quadratically divergent contributions to the higgs mass and the electroweak precision observables imply different scales for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , the first one below @xmath4 tev and the second above @xmath5 tev .",
    "this is the so called little hierarchy problem .",
    "an interesting attempt to solve it , inspired in an old suggestion by georgi and pais @xcite , is the littlest higgs model ( lh ) @xcite which is based on a @xmath0 non - sigma linear model ( see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "being a goldstone boson ( gb ) associated to this spontaneous symmetry breaking , the higgs is massless in principle .",
    "however one - loop corrections produce a logarithmically divergent higgs mass that could be compatible with the present experimental bound of about @xmath6 gev .",
    "the others gb present in the model get quadratically divergent masses at the one - loop level becoming very massive or give masses to the sm and other additional gauge bosons present in the model through the higgs mechanism .",
    "all of these new states could give rise to a very rich phenomenology that could be proved at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "from the lh model it is possible , at least in principle , to compute the higgs low - energy effective potential .",
    "obviously this effective potential should reproduce the form of the sm potential , i.e. : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the sm higgs doublet and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the well known higgs mass and higgs selfcoupling parameters .",
    "notice that , in order to have spontaneous symmetry breaking of the electroweak symmetry , @xmath9 must be negative and @xmath10 must be positive to have a well defined energy minimum .",
    "in addition these parameters should reproduce the sm relation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the higgs mass and @xmath13 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .    in principle @xmath9 and @xmath10 receive contributions from fermion , gauge boson and scalar loops , besides others that could come from the ultraviolet completion of the lh model @xcite . in this work",
    "we continue our program consisting in the computation of the relevant terms of the higgs low - energy effective potential and their phenomenological consequences including new restrictions on the parameter space of the lh model .",
    "in particular we will study the consistency of the electroweak symmetry breaking with the present experimental data in the case in which , for the sake of simplicity , one neglects the contribution of higher dimensional operators coming from the ultraviolet completion of the lh model that are generically present .    in @xcite",
    "we obtained the ( one - loop ) contribution coming from the third generation quarks @xmath14 and @xmath15 plus the @xmath16 quark present in the lh model .",
    "this contribution is essential since it provides the right positive sign for @xmath9 being other contributions negative .",
    "here we complete the one - loop computation of the higgs potential by including also gauge bosons and clarifying the role of the gb at this level .",
    "we also discuss the validity of the one - loop potential and the necessity of including some important higher loop contributions to reproduce the expected value of the higgs mass .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the lh model and set the notation . in section 3 we study the lh model as a gauged non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) .",
    "in particular we pay attention to the problem of the quartic divergencies appearing when a cutoff @xmath1 is used to regulate the divergences of the model and we show how they cancel at the one - loop level .",
    "we also obtain the gauge fixing and faddeev - popov terms appropriate for the calculation of the different gauge boson loops appearing latter in our computations . in section 4",
    "we compute the effective potential at the one - loop level .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a discussion of our results and the constraints that our computation establishes on the lh parameters .",
    "finally , in section 6 we present the main conclusions of this paper and the prospects for future work .",
    "as it is well know the low energy dynamics of the lh model can be described by a @xmath17 gauged non - linear sigma model based on the coset @xmath18 .",
    "the goldstone boson fields can be disposed in a @xmath19 matrix @xmath20 given by : @xmath21 where : @xmath22 has the proper @xmath23 symmetry breaking structure with @xmath24 being the @xmath25 unit matrix , and @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the sm higgs doublet , @xmath28 is the real scalar and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the real triplet and the complex triplet respectively : @xmath31 and @xmath32 the gauged non - linear sigma model lagrangian describing the low - energy gb and gauge boson dynamics is given by : @xmath33.\\ ] ] the covariant derivative is defined as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the gauge couplings , @xmath37 , for @xmath38 , @xmath39 for @xmath40 and zero otherwise , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . diagonalizing the gauge boson mass matrix in this lagrangian one realizes that the @xmath43 and @xmath44 sm gauge bosons are massless and the @xmath45 and @xmath46 gauge bosons have masses : @xmath47 the gauge bosons mass eigenstates are defined such as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51    a modified version of the lh model , such that the gauge subgroup of @xmath23 is @xmath52 $ ] rather than @xmath53 ^ 2 $ ] , has also been introduced  @xcite . in this case , the covariant derivative is defined as : @xmath54 where the generators @xmath55 are the same as in the previous case , and @xmath56diag@xmath57 .",
    "the field content of the matrix @xmath58 in @xmath20 is the same as in the lh model but there is no @xmath59 now .",
    "we consider in our analysis these two different models : the original lh with two @xmath60 groups ( _ model i _ ) and the other one with just one @xmath60 group ( _ model ii _ ) .",
    "then , at the tree level , the @xmath61 sm gauge group remains unbroken .",
    "the spontaneously symmetry breaking of this group is expected to be produced in principle radiatively , mainly due to the effect of the virtual quark fields from the third generation , which give rise to an appropriate effective potential for the sm higgs doublet .",
    "these quarks will initially be denoted by @xmath62 and @xmath15 and the additional vector - like quark will be denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "the interactions between these fermions and the goldstone bosons are given by the yukawa lagrangian : @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 with : @xmath68 and @xmath69 here @xmath70 and @xmath16 are the mass eigenvectors coming from the mass matrix included in the yukawa lagrangian with eigenvalues : @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "notice that , contrary to the quark @xmath16 which is massive already at this level , the @xmath14 quark is massless and acquires mass only when the electroweak symmetry is broken .",
    "then , the yukawa lagrangian can be written as : @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 the higgs - quark interaction matrix is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are functions on @xmath79 whose expansion starts as : @xmath80 thus the complete lagrangian for the quarks is : @xmath81with @xmath82diag@xmath83 .",
    "since we are interested in the computation of the contribution to the sm higgs @xmath84 effective potential , we can set @xmath85 .",
    "in order to compute the contributions to the higgs potential coming from scalar and gauge boson loops it is useful to study the lh model as a particular case of gauged non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) based on the coset @xmath18 ( see  @xcite for a review on gauged nlsm ) . to start with we will turn off the gauge interactions by taken @xmath86 . then the @xmath87 lagrangian is : @xmath88\\ ] ] this lagrangian can be written also as a nlsm lagrangian @xmath89 where @xmath90 are gaussian coordinates on @xmath91 and the @xmath91 metric is defined as : @xmath92 this metric can be split as @xmath93 where @xmath94 and we have written @xmath58 as @xmath95 with the @xmath96 matrices normalized so that tr@xmath97 .",
    "now we consider the coupling of the nlsm with any other field @xmath30 which for simplicity will be taken to be a real scalar .",
    "the corresponding action can be written as @xmath98=s_{0}[\\pi]+s'[\\pi,\\phi]$ ] .",
    "the effective action for the @xmath30 field can be obtained by integrating out the gb fields @xmath99 .",
    "however this integration is not trivial at all . due to the geometrical nature of the nlsm , not only its action , but also the integration measure ,",
    "must be @xmath100 invariant and covariant in the @xmath91 coset sense @xcite .",
    "thus the proper @xmath30 effective action is given by : @xmath101}=\\int [ d\\pi \\sqrt{g}]e^{is[\\pi,\\phi]}\\ ] ] the measure factor @xmath102 can now be exponentiated to find @xmath101}=\\int [ d\\pi]e^{i(s[\\pi,\\phi]+\\delta\\gamma[\\pi])}\\ ] ] with @xmath103&=&-\\frac{i}{2}\\delta(0)\\int dx \\log(1+\\delta)\\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{i}{2}\\delta(0)\\sigma_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}\\int dx \\mbox{tr}\\delta^{k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where by using the notation @xmath104 with @xmath105 being the space - time dimensionality so that : @xmath106 in the dimensional regularization scheme one has @xmath107 but using an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath1 to define divergent integrals @xmath108 which obviously does not vanish .",
    "then , in order to take into account the invariant measure effects in the nlsm one needs to add to the classical lagrangian the term @xmath109 whenever one is not using dimensional regularization .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this term is formally of the same order as the one - loop contributions .    on the other hand",
    "the gb contribution to the higgs effective potential is defined as @xmath110=-\\int dx v_{eff}(\\overline{\\pi})\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is a constant field and @xmath112}=\\int [ d\\pi'\\sqrt{g}]e^{is_{0}[\\overline{\\pi}+\\pi']}\\ ] ] with @xmath113}{\\delta \\pi}|_{\\pi=\\overline{\\pi}}=0\\ ] ] at the one - loop level the last equation can be written as @xmath114}{\\delta \\pi}|_{\\pi=\\overline{\\pi } } \\simeq 0\\ ] ] and then the nlsm action can be expanded as @xmath115&=&s_{0}[\\overline{\\pi}]\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\int dx dy \\pi'^{\\alpha}(x)\\frac{\\delta^{2}s_{0}}{\\delta \\pi^{\\alpha } ( x)\\delta\\pi^{\\beta}(y)}\\big\\vert_{\\pi=\\overline{\\pi } } \\pi'^{\\beta}(y ) \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore we have @xmath110=s_{0}[\\overline{\\pi}]+\\frac{i}{2}\\mbox{tr log}(1+go)+ ... \\ ] ] where the inverse gb propagator is @xmath116 @xmath117 being the short for @xmath118 and @xmath119 in order to compute the higgs effective action we only need to consider the case @xmath120cte which means @xmath121 and then we have @xmath122 therefore we get @xmath110=\\frac{i}{2 } \\mbox{tr}\\sigma_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}(og)^{k}+ ... \\ ] ] or @xmath110=\\frac{i}{2}\\delta(0)\\int dx \\mbox{tr}\\left(\\delta-\\frac{\\delta^{2}}{2}+\\frac{\\delta^{3}}{3}+ ...",
    "\\right)+ ... \\ ] ] this effective action has exactly the same form as the measure term discussed above so finally we get : @xmath110+\\delta\\gamma[\\overline{\\pi}]=0\\ ] ] therefore we arrive to the important conclusion that the gb do not contribute to the higgs potential in any nlsm at the one loop level and in particular this is the case for the @xmath0 lh model .      in the following",
    "we will concentrate on the gauge bosons in order to be able to compute their contribution to the higgs effective potential .",
    "thus we turn on again the gauge boson fields in the nlsm : @xmath123\\ ] ] the covariant derivative can be written in terms of the mass eigenstates as : @xmath124 where the different couplings and generators are defined as : @xmath125 the first four definitions correspond to the diagonal group @xmath126 and the last four to the axial group @xmath127 .",
    "notice that @xmath128 and @xmath129 are functions of the mixing angles @xmath130 ( for the @xmath131 group ) and @xmath132 ( for the @xmath60 group ) .    expanding the lagrangian we obtain the gauge and gb mixed terms : @xmath133 where @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath28 are the gb which will give masses to the heavy gauge bosons @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "following the standard faddeev - popov procedure it is not difficult to find the gauge fixing and the ghost lagrangian .",
    "the first one is given by @xmath137 which cancels the unwanted mixing terms ( [ mixterm ] ) and makes the propagator well defined .",
    "for a gauge boson @xmath138 the faddeev - popov lagrangian is @xmath139 where @xmath140 in the general case the effect of the gauge transformations on the gb and the gauge boson fields @xmath138 will be @xmath141 and @xmath142 where",

    "in addition , by using the landau gauge , we do not have to consider any ghost field at this level .",

    "the general form of the effective potential is @xmath163 where we keep only the first two terms which are the relevant ones for the electroweak symmetry breaking and , in particular , for the computation of the higgs mass .",

    "let us discuss now briefly how the heavy gauge boson masses depend on mixing angles @xmath130 .",
    "we know that @xmath199 is of the order of @xmath215 tev ( see eq.([eq : heavygb ] ) ) and from these equations we can obtain restrictions on the mixing angles . in fig.[figmasas ] we show the dependence of @xmath199 on @xmath216 and the scale @xmath191 .",
    "we found that 0.5 @xmath217 0.8 implies masses smaller than 0.6 tev and then these values for @xmath216 can be ruled out . from this results we get the preferred ranges :",
    "@xmath218 0.5 or @xmath219 0.7 .    taking into account the above bounds on the lh model parameters we now focus on obtaining the corresponding @xmath177 values according to our previous one - loop computation which includes both , the fermionic and gauge bosons contributions .",
    "we find that , in the case of the _ model ii _ , the lowest allowed value for @xmath177 is @xmath2200.34 tev being @xmath221=0.7 , @xmath2220.8 tev , @xmath22311.95 tev and @xmath2240.2 .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , it is also needed to add in principle the additional constraint @xmath225",
    ". then in fig.[figm2 ] we show as an example the allowed regions for the _ model ii_. two different regions can be found .",
    "this is due to the mixing angle coming from the heavy gauge boson mass . in this case",
    "the lowest value for @xmath177 is @xmath2200.491 tev corresponding to @xmath2260.55 , @xmath2220.95 tev , @xmath1=10 tev and @xmath2240.47 .",
    "therefore it is clear that the condition @xmath225 is relevant in order to constraint the possible values of the lh model parameters .",
    "+    a similar analysis have been done for @xmath211 tev .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[figm2f4 ] .",
    "the allowed region is smaller in this case .",
    "the reason for obtaining just some points of the parameter space allowed by the condition @xmath225 is that @xmath186 has a logarithmical dependence on the energy scale @xmath1 and a linear dependence on @xmath191 coming from the new heavy particle masses , while @xmath10 depends quadratically on @xmath227 .",
    "therefore , greater values of @xmath1 leads to a disadvantageous region for @xmath225 . in this case",
    "the lowest value for @xmath177 is @xmath2200.916 tev corresponding to @xmath2260.68 , @xmath2224 tev , @xmath1=50 tev and @xmath2240.086 .",
    "+    from the above results , it is clear that is difficult to satisfy the condition @xmath225 with @xmath177 about @xmath6 gev , as expected by the precision electroweak measurements  @xcite .",
    "we also show in fig.[surfaces ] the contours of the viable regions in the @xmath171-@xmath191 plane with the condition @xmath225 .",
    "the values of the mixing angle @xmath130 are fixed to the values @xmath228 ( top panel ) and @xmath229 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "we check that the results for @xmath230 closed to @xmath196 , i.e @xmath231 , are similar to the ones for @xmath228 .",
    "the condition @xmath232 is imposed .",
    "one can see that values of @xmath191 around @xmath233 tev are the preferred ones for our selected choices of the lh parameters .",
    "however the @xmath177 values are higher than about @xmath234 gev for all cases .",
    "therefore , it is clear that it is not enough to consider the one - loop effective potential of the lh model .",
    "in this work we have completed the computation of the one - loop effective higgs potential in the context of two versions ( _ model i _ and _ model ii _ ) of the lh model .",
    "in particular we have obtained the values of the radiatively generated @xmath177 and @xmath10 parameters .",
    "our computation includes the effect of virtual heavy quarks @xmath235 and @xmath16 , together with the heavy and electroweak gauge bosons present in the lh model .",
    "we have also clarify the role of the gb when a cutoff is used to regulate the ultraviolet divergencies .",
    "these gb do not contribute to the higgs effective potential at the one - loop level but they do at higher orders .",
    "the values of @xmath177 and @xmath10 that we get have the right signs and are compatible in principle with all the phenomenological constraints set on the lh model parameter space .",
    "however the values found for the @xmath177 parameter are too high to be compatible with the expected higgs mass , which should not be larger than about 200 gev according to the electroweak precision data .",
    "this problem is even worst if one takes into account the relation @xmath225 which must hold on the @xmath177 and @xmath10 parameters of the effective higgs potential to reproduce the sm . as a conclusion",
    "the low - energy , one - loop effective potential of the lh model can not reproduce the sm potential with a low enough higgs mass to agree with the standard expectations .",
    "however there are some indications suggesting that higher order gb loops could reduce the higgs boson mass so that complete compatibility with the experimental constraints can be obtained .",
    "work is in progress in order to check if this is really the case @xcite .",
    "from ( [ l0 ] ) it is possible to find the gauge bosons couplings to doublet higgs , needed for our computations , which turn to be :    massless gauge bosons - massless gauge bosons : @xmath236    heavy gauge bosons - massless gauge bosons : @xmath237    heavy gauge bosons - heavy gauge bosons :    @xmath238-\\frac{1}{4}g^{2}hh^{\\dag}\\right\\}w_{\\mu}^{'1}w^{'1\\mu},\\\\ & & \\left\\{g_{w'w'}\\left[-3(g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2})^{2}(h^{0*}h^{+}-h^{0}h^{+*})^{2 } + 4g_{1}^{2}g_{2}^{2}(hh^{\\dag})^{2}\\right]-\\frac{1}{4}g^{2}hh^{\\dag}\\right\\}w_{\\mu}^{'2}w^{'2\\mu},\\\\ & & \\left\\{g_{w'w'}\\left[-12(g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2})^{2}(h^{0}h^{0*}h^{+}h^{+ * } ) + ( 10g_{1}^{2}g_{2}^{2}+3(g_{1}^{4}+g_{2}^{4}))(hh^{\\dag})^{2}\\right]-\\frac{1}{4}g^{2 } hh^{\\dag}\\right\\}w_{\\mu}^{'3}w^{'3\\mu},\\\\ & & \\left\\{g_{b'b'}\\left[3(g_{1}^{'4}+g_{2}^{'4})+10g_{1}^{'2}g_{2}^{'2 } \\right](hh^{\\dag})^{2}-\\frac{1}{4}g^{'2}hh^{\\dag}\\right\\}b^{'}_{\\mu}b^{'\\mu},\\\\ & & g_{w'b'}(h^{0*}h^{+}+h^{0}h^{+*})w_{\\mu}^{'1}b^{'\\mu},\\\\ & i&g_{w'b'}(h^{0*}h^{+}-h^{0}h^{+*})w_{\\mu}^{'2}b^{'\\mu } , \\\\ & & g_{w'b'}(h^{0}h^{0*}+h^{+}h^{+*})w_{\\mu}^{'3}b^{'\\mu}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the different couplings appearing above are given by :    @xmath239 @xmath240    @xmath241 @xmath242    @xmath243 @xmath244    @xmath245",
