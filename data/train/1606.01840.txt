    "temporal correlation of interference affects the temporal correlation of outage , and subsequently , it impacts many network performance metrics , e.g. , end - to - end throughput , multi - hop delay , etc .",
    "assuming uncorrelated user activity and fading over time , the user mobility is the main factor reducing the temporal correlation of interference  @xcite .    in areas with blockage , different users as well as a single user at different time slots , may be blocked by some common obstacles .",
    "the interference level is dominated by the transmissions , and the transitions between and propagation conditions due to mobility will reduce the temporal correlation of interference .",
    "however , blockage simultaneously introduces spatial correlation among the users .",
    "this is due to correlated penetration losses .",
    "mobility , however , will not induce significant decorrelation of interference when the number of users is high .",
    "studying the impact of blockage on the moments of interference is a topic of growing interest  @xcite , considering the ongoing standardization activities for commercial wireless networks in millimeter - wave bands .",
    "nevertheless , interference correlation with blockage is yet to be studied . without blockage ,",
    "the temporal correlation of interference depends on the user displacement law  @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we show that with blockage , the correlation of interference does not depend only on the mobility and the penetration losses but also on the user density . in sparse networks , where the spatial correlation among the users is negligible , the transitions in the propagation conditions from to due to mobility dominate the temporal statistics of interference . as a result",
    ", blockage reduces the temporal correlation of interference . on the other hand , in dense networks",
    ", the correlation in the interference levels generated by different users dominates the temporal correlation of interference and mobility may not help much in reducing it .    in our analysis , we use the model , e.g.  @xcite , because it has some desirable features for our problem : it is defined over a finite area , and it results in a non - uniform distribution of users .",
    "we use the model over a lattice because in that case the user displacement law is known for time - lags equal to one and two time slots  @xcite . for larger time - lags ,",
    "approximations to the user displacement are also available for a zero think time .",
    "note that by increasing the lattice size and at the same time the user speed , one can obtain approximations for the continuous space .",
    "even though , a deployment would be naturally more relevant , the scenario allows to get analytical insight on the system behaviour .",
    "also , one can still find practical applications , e.g. , correlation of interference in vehicular networks .",
    "we consider a poisson number of users , with mean @xmath0 , which are moving across a lattice of size @xmath1 .",
    "each user selects uniformly at random a destination , and travels with a constant speed @xmath2 lattice points per time slot .",
    "when it reaches the destination , it stops and thinks for a number of time slots selected from the discrete uniform distribution on @xmath3 .",
    "let us denote the of the @xmath4-th user location by @xmath5 .",
    "its in the steady state is  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the average think time for a randomly selected user .",
    "given the location @xmath8 , let us denote by @xmath9 the probability that the user is located at the lattice point @xmath10 after @xmath11 time slots .",
    "the model introduces different levels of mobility at different locations .",
    "for instance , the probability that a user thinks at the lattice point @xmath8 is @xmath12 , which means that the users close to the center tend to move with higher probability than the users near the boundaries  @xcite .",
    "we compute the interference at the locations , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "let consider a poisson number of obstacles , with mean @xmath15 , distributed uniformly at random in the continuous space @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the obstacles do not hinder the user moves , but they attenuate the user signal .",
    "the number of obstacles @xmath17 on the link @xmath18 , between the @xmath4-th user and the location @xmath19 , is a poisson with parameter @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "the fraction of penetration power loss per obstacle follows the uniform distribution on @xmath23 $ ] , @xmath24 .",
    "the fraction of penetration loss , @xmath25 , over the link @xmath26 is equal to the product of the power loss fractions from all obstacles on that link .",
    "note that the @xmath25 and @xmath5 are dependent , e.g. , the longer the link @xmath26 is , the higher the penetration loss should be , because more obstacles are likely to block the user .",
    "assuming common transmit power level @xmath27 for all users , the interference at an arbitrarily selected time slot @xmath28 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a bernoulli describing the @xmath4-th user activity , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is an exponential with unit mean modeling rayleigh fading , @xmath33 is the for the @xmath4-th user location with given in  , and @xmath34 is the distance - based propagation pathloss function , where @xmath35 is used to avoid singularity at @xmath36 .",
    "it is assumed that the user activity and fading are over time slots and users . on the other hand , with the model",
    ", the locations of a user are correlated in time .",
    "different users move independently of each other but their penetration losses are in general correlated because they may be blocked by some common obstacles .",

    ", we use the pearson correlation coefficient which is defined as the ratio of the covariance of @xmath46 divided by the product of their standard deviations . in the steady state ,",
    "the moments of interference become independent of the time we take the measurements , and the pearson correlation coefficient becomes @xmath47",

    "the term @xmath59 indicates the density of obstacles .    in order to compute the moments of interference",
    ", one has to average over the distributions of fading , penetration loss , number of users , user activity and location .",
    "@xmath60 in ( a ) , we used that the @xmath61 , are dependent . in ( b ) , we computed @xmath62 from equation   for @xmath63 , we used that the users are indistinct , and we took the average in terms of the poisson distribution @xmath64 .",

    "similarly , one can do the computation for @xmath97 . finally , @xmath98 .    for impenetrable obstacles , @xmath99 , when @xmath83 and @xmath84 or vice - versa , @xmath100 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath101 .",
    "the calculation of the mean and standard deviation of interference are validated in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanstd ] .",
    "the impact of blockage on the mean is more prominent close to the center because over there , the term @xmath102 filters out interference from both sides of location @xmath103 . near the boundaries ,",
    "fewer users are located and the interference is practically generated from one direction .",
    "the standard deviation of the generated interference is affected less from blockage because : ( i ) the terms @xmath104 and @xmath102 , which are less than unity , are under the square root in the computation of the standard deviation .",
    "( ii ) the correlation of interference levels generated from different users increases the standard deviation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanstd ] , one may see that by ignoring the spatial correlation , i.e. , @xmath105 , the underestimation error may become non - negligilble .",

    "can be read as @xmath111 , where @xmath112    without blockage , i.e. , @xmath113 , the correlation coefficient @xmath114 is independent of the user density .    after replacing in equation  , @xmath115",
    ", we get @xmath116 , which is independent of the number of users @xmath0 . also , @xmath117 .    with blockage , the correlation coefficient @xmath114 increases with the number of users @xmath0 .    with blockage , @xmath118 for @xmath119 where @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , for @xmath123 , @xmath124",
    "since the terms @xmath125 are positive , and the pearson correlation coeffcient is at most equal to unity , we get @xmath126 .",
    "based on that , we can show that the derivative of @xmath114 in terms of @xmath0 is positive .",
    "if we expand @xmath114 around @xmath127 , we get @xmath128 . therefore , by making the number of users @xmath0 sufficiently large , we can guarante that @xmath129 . using that @xmath130",
    ", one can show that for @xmath123 , @xmath131 . since @xmath114 increases with @xmath0 according to lemma 2 , there will be a critical number of users @xmath132 such that for @xmath133 we have @xmath134 .",
    "the critical number @xmath132 is different at different points of the lattice .",
    "equation   can be used to calculate the correlation of interference for any mobility model .",
    "next , we show how to compute the correlation , @xmath135 , for time - lag @xmath136 and user speed @xmath137 under .",
    "the number of obstacles over the link @xmath138 follows the distribution @xmath139 , and it remains to identify the distribution of obstacles over the link @xmath140 for all possible displacements @xmath141 .",
    "for that , we separate between four cases .",
    "* case 1 * : @xmath142 .",
    "( i ) if the user thinks with probability @xmath143 , the @xmath144 and @xmath145 are fully correlated .",
    "hence , @xmath146 .",
    "( ii ) if the user moves to the right with probability @xmath147 , the number of obstacles that the user bypasses follows the poisson distribution @xmath148 . hence , @xmath149 .",
    "( iii ) if the user moves to the left with probability @xmath150 , the extra number of obstacles blocking the user signal follows the poisson distribution @xmath148 and , @xmath151 .",
    "therefore for @xmath152 , the term @xmath153 , is @xmath154    * case 2 : * @xmath155 .",
    "similar to case 1 , we may compute @xmath156 @xmath157 * case 3 : * @xmath158 . when the user is located at @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and it moves to the left , @xmath161 .",
    "when it moves to the right , it passes over the location @xmath103 and the number of obstacles it sees at the two time slots are poisson .",

    "similar to case 3 , the term @xmath167 , and @xmath168 can be written as @xmath169 for impenetrable obstacles , which is a reasonable approximation for propagation in the millimeter - wave bands , the above equations are further simplified . finally , one has to sum up the terms @xmath170 , and the calculation of @xmath171 for @xmath136 and @xmath137 is complete .",
    "the calculations for @xmath172 and @xmath173 can be carried out in a similar manner .     at the locations @xmath103 .",
    "the parameter settings are available in the caption of fig .",

    "the temporal correlation of interference is higher close to the border because over there the level of mobility is lower .",
    "the impact of blockage on the correlation depends on the location and the density of users .",
    "close to the boundaries , where the user density is low , the transitions from to and vice versa dominate , and the interference correlation becomes less as compared to the case without obstacles . on the other hand , close to the center , where the user density increases , the correlated interference levels from the different users dominate over the randomness introduced by the mobility , and the correlation coefficients become higher .",
    "for the parameter settings used to generated fig .",
    "[ fig : tempcorr ] , we observe cross - over points at some locations , see remark 2 .",
    "one may also see that ignoring the correlated interference levels among the users results in significant underestimation errors for the correlation coefficients .",
    "finally , in the limit of infinite think time , @xmath175 , the network becomes static and the user distribution uniform . without blockage , the correlation coefficient under rayleigh fading and continuous user activity",
    "is equal to @xmath176  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempcorr ] , we see that blockage increases further the correlation coefficient and also makes it location - dependent .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempcorr2 ] , we compare the correlation coefficients @xmath177 between a mobile network and a static network with user distribution given in  .",
    "blockage increases the correlation coefficient @xmath177 in the static case , but mobility brings the correlation down when the number of users is low , e.g. , @xmath178 .",
    "when the user density is high , e.g. , @xmath179 , the spatial correlation among the users dominates , and mobility can not make the correlation less than in the case without blockage . for higher user speeds , @xmath180 ,",
    "the correlation remains high in the center where the user density is high .",
    "close to the boundary , the high mobility along with the lower user density can make the correlation of interference low but not less as compared to the case without blockage .",
