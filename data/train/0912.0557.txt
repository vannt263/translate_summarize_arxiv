    "the paper studies a bosonization of the virasoro algebra .",
    "the challenge behind this work is to provide a unified constructive approach to the study and classification of two - dimensional conformal field theories .",
    "we believe that every two - dimensional conformal field theory model can be bosonized , i.e.  represented in terms of a number of free bosons .",
    "since every two - dimensional conformal model has a symmetry , described by the virasoro algebra , it is a natural idea to bosonize the virasoro algebra .",
    "there is a canonical construction of the virasoro algebra in terms of free bosons : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an orthonormal set of free boson fields .",
    "the central charge of the virasoro algebra in this construction is @xmath2 , the number of the free bosons . in order to obtain noninteger values of central charge",
    "we suggest a modified construction of the virasoro field , which involves vertex operators .",
    "we introduce the following ansatz @xmath3 and study conditions under which the field @xmath4 satisfies the virasoro algebra . here",
    "@xmath5 is a free boson field associated with vector @xmath6 , normal ordering is implied and cocycle factors associated with the exponents of free boson fields are omitted for the brevity of this introduction .",
    "( the cocycles take their place a bit later in the paper . ) the expression above is a very general unitary field of scaling dimension 2 build from free bosons .",
    "the first term is similar to the canonical one in  ( [ canonical ] ) , the difference is that a symmetric matrix @xmath7 is introduced .",
    "the second term is a sum of vertex operators of scaling dimension 2 with numerical real coefficients @xmath8 .",
    "the third term is constructed from vertex operators of scaling dimension 1 multiplied by a derivative of the free boson field .",
    "as we will see the ansatz generates a very rich theory and leads in a very natural way to the introduction of a new combinatorial geometric object , a generalization of a notion of root systems of simple lie algebras .",
    "we call these new generalized root systems `` quasi root systems '' .",
    "the bosonization technique was successfully employed in different areas of mathematics and physics .",
    "we list only a few examples that are closely related to our construction .",
    "the famous example is the bosonization of the two - dimensional massless fermion : @xmath9 the idea led to important results in condensed matter physics and to the `` physical '' derivation of the jacobi triple product identity .",
    "another example is from the theory of affine kac - moody algebras .",
    "the frenkel - kac construction  @xcite gives an explicit realization of a simply laced ( i.e.  of ade type ) affine kac - moody algebra on level 1 in terms of a number ( equal to the rank of the algebra ) of free bosons .",
    "the cartan generators of the affine algebra are given by @xmath10 and the generators associated to the root vectors of the algebra are expressed as @xmath11 where the roots @xmath6 have a standard normalization @xmath12 . taking a sum of a few such constructions one can get a realization for the affine algebra on any positive integer level .",
    "in the string theory oriented conformal field theory we find another bosonization example - the kazama - suzuki models  @xcite .",
    "the authors find many new unitary models of the @xmath13 superconformal algebra by constructing explicitly the algebra in terms of free boson fields .",
    "in fact the construction by kazama and suzuki led us to the idea of introducing the ansatz directly for the virasoro algebra rather than for the @xmath13 superconformal algebra .",
    "we discuss the relation of the kazama - suzuki construction to our ansatz in section  [ @xmath13 superconformal algebra bosonic constructions ] .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in section  [ the setup ]",
    "we introduce the formalism and the ingredients for our ansatz : the free boson algebra , the language of formal distributions and operator product expansions , and the vertex operators .",
    "then in section  [ vertex operator realization of the virasoro algebra ] we recall the definition of the virasoro algebra , introduce the ansatz and give the simplest example of the construction based just on one free boson . in section  [ long formulas ]",
    "we derive and tabulate the lengthy formulae for the commutation relations of terms forming the virasoro field in our ansatz . in section",
    "[ consistency conditions for the roots ] we establish the consistency conditions for the set of vectors @xmath6 and @xmath14 in  ( [ main_introduction ] ) and state our main theorem introducing quasi root systems for the first time .",
    "the definition of quasi root systems is given in section  [ definition of quasi root system ] , and a list of examples of quasi root systems is presented in section  [ examples of quasi root systems ] and in appendix  [ qr_dim3 ] . section  [ solutions for the ansatz ] is devoted to solving the ansatz for the range of examples of quasi root systems .",
    "we review the literature on the subject in section  [ literature review ] outlining the differences between the constructions studied there and our ansatz . in section  [ open problems ]",
    "we discuss possible future developments in the subject .",
    "appendix  [ more general constructions ] concerns with possible generalizations of our ansatz .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce the algebraic apparatus needed for the bosonization construction .      the starting point is the heisenberg algebra , which is probably the simplest infinite dimensional lie algebra .",
    "it is generated by @xmath15 and an additional generator @xmath16 , subject to the following commutation relations : @xmath17 } } & = n \\ , \\delta_{m+n,0}\\ , , \\\\ { { \\big[}q , a_n{\\big]}}&={\\mathrm{i}}\\ , \\delta_{n,0 } , \\end{aligned }   \\quad n , m \\in \\mathbb{z}.\\ ] ] in two - dimensional conformal field theory this algebra describes a free boson system .",
    "we introduce formal power series ( we ll call them `` fields '' following the physical language ) with algebra generators serving as coefficients of the series .",
    "so we define a free boson field @xmath18 and its derivative @xmath19 : @xmath20 it is convenient to split the free boson field into `` positive '' and `` negative '' parts : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 we essentially also split the generators of the heisenberg algebra into two groups , creation ( @xmath23 ) and annihilation ( @xmath24 ) operators .",
    "note that the creation operators are commutative between themselves , as well as the annihilation operators . and therefore @xmath25}}={{\\big[}\\phi^-(z ) ,   \\phi^-(w){\\big]}}=0.\\ ] ]    at this point we can introduce the normal ordering convention .",
    "normal ordering @xmath26 of a product of heisenberg algebra generators means that the generators are simply reordered so that all the creation operators are to the left from the annihilation operators .",
    "for example @xmath27 .",
    "next we calculate the commutator between the positive and negative parts of the free boson field : @xmath28}}=-\\sum _ { n > 0 } \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\frac{w}{z}\\right)^n + \\ln{z}\\ ] ] the series here is an expansion of a function @xmath29 in @xmath30 around @xmath31 in the region @xmath32",

    "one just takes @xmath36 mutually commutative copies of the heisenberg algebra , which form @xmath36 independent bosonic fields @xmath37 .",
    "the commutation relation  ( [ phi_commutator ] ) in the multidimensional form reads @xmath38}}=\\delta_{\\mu\\ , \\nu}s_{z > w}\\ln{(z - w ) } , \\qquad \\mu,\\nu=1,\\ldots , d.\\ ] ] we embed these free boson fields into the @xmath36-dimensional euclidean space @xmath39 with a standard scalar product , which we denote by @xmath40 . the notation @xmath41 will stand for @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the euclidean components of vector @xmath6 . in this notation",
    "the analogue of  ( [ phi_commutator_multi ] ) reads @xmath44}}=(\\alpha,\\beta)s_{z >",

    "a formal delta - function @xmath52 is given by the following formal power series : @xmath53 it is easy to see that @xmath54 we will also need the derivatives of the formal delta - function : @xmath55 the standard rules for the dirac delta - function apply , the most important one is @xmath56 the delta - function language is useful in computations of different commutation relations .",
    "for example the commutator of two derivatives of the free boson field , obtained from  ( [ pd_phi_commutator_alpha ] ) , can be written as @xmath57}}=-(\\alpha,\\beta){\\delta^{(1)}(z - w)}\\ , .\\ ] ]    in what follows the commutators of fields will be always expressed in terms of the formal delta function and its derivatives .",
    "readers who are more familiar with the language of operator product expansions commonly used in physical literature on conformal field theory can just simply replace the commutators by operator product expansions and the delta functions by negative powers of @xmath58 following the rule : @xmath59 then for example the analogue of the commutator relation  ( [ bosons_commutation ] ) will look like @xmath60 in the formalism of operator product expansions .",
    "in this section we again follow the lines of the book  @xcite .",
    "vertex operators @xmath61 are defined as bosonic exponents multiplied by cocycles @xmath62 , which are elements of a twisted group algebra , here @xmath63 .",
    "the twisted group algebra is well defined in the case of integer lattice only .",
    "so we take @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is an integer lattice .",

    "the 2-cocycle is defined by the following properties @xmath69 here all @xmath70 .",
    "one can always find a cocycle which is bimultiplicative @xmath71 and takes values @xmath72 for all @xmath73 .",
    "the proof is given by the following explicit procedure .",
    "choose an ordered basis of @xmath65 : @xmath74 , define the 2-cocycle on the basis vectors : @xmath75 and extend the 2-cocycle to all the vectors on the lattice @xmath65 by bimultiplicativity .",
    "it is easy to prove that in the above choice of cocycle the following identity takes place @xmath76 for any vector @xmath77 .",
    "in particular @xmath78 , if @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , if @xmath81 .",
    "it follows from  ( [ cocycle_1 ] ) and ( [ bimultiplicativity ] ) that @xmath82 .",
    "the virasoro algebra is the most important algebra in conformal field theory .",
    "it is an infinite dimensional lie algebra generated by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , subject to the following commutation relations : @xmath85}}&=(n - m)l_{n+m}+ c\\,\\frac{n(n^2 - 1)}{12}\\delta_{n+m,0}\\ , , \\\\",

    "here we also switch to the language of formal power series by introducing the virasoro field : @xmath88 then the virasoro commutation relation in terms of fields reads @xmath89}}=\\frac{c}{2}{\\delta^{(3)}(z - w)}+2l(w){\\delta^{(1)}(z - w)}+{\\partial}l(w){\\delta(z - w)}.\\ ] ]    we are going to construct a general realization of the virasoro algebra in terms of free bosons .",
    "there is a well known canonical form of the virasoro algebra associated to the free boson system : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath92 .",
    "the field @xmath93 generates the virasoro algebra with central charge @xmath2 .",
    "we are looking for nonstandard realizations of the virasoro algebra involving vertex operators .",
    "so we introduce the following ansatz : @xmath94 here @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 is a symmetric real matrix , @xmath98 .",
    "this is a very general form of the virasoro field , which is apriori unitary .",
    "the first term in  ( [ main ] ) is similar to the standard construction in  ( [ canonical construction ] ) , one just introduces the matrix @xmath7 into the term .",
    "the second term is a sum of vertex operators based on vectors @xmath6 of square length 4 .",
    "we will call such vectors `` long roots '' .",
    "the third term is composed of vertex operators based on vectors @xmath14 of square length 2 , multiplied by a derivative of the boson field .",
    "we will refer to such vectors @xmath14 as `` short roots '' .",
    "one still has to check that the expression in  ( [ main ] ) indeed satisfies the virasoro algebra .",
    "there will be additional constraints on the roots and coefficients .",
    "we will see later that the problem of finding a solution to the virasoro algebra commutation relation in form  ( [ main ] ) can be divided to two parts : first  find the appropriate set of roots , second  solve a set of quadratic equations for the coefficients @xmath97 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "now we would like to illustrate the idea on a simple example .",
    "the simplest example involves just one free boson field @xmath18 . in one dimension",
    "the ansatz  ( [ main ] ) becomes @xmath101 we omit the cocycles since in the case of one - dimensional even lattice the twisted group algebra is trivial ( i.e.  all 2-cocycles @xmath68 can be set to one ) .",
    "we have to check that the expression satisfies the virasoro algebra commutation relation  ( [ virasoro relation ] ) .",
    "we do not want to present here the explicit calculation of the commutator , since we do it later in the general case . but readers familiar with the basics of conformal field theory should be able to do this easy calculation .",
    "the result is that the field  ( [ main_in_one_dimension ] ) generates the virasoro algebra provided the following set of equations is satisfied : @xmath102 then the central charge @xmath87 is given by @xmath103 the set of equations has 4 solutions : @xmath104 the two nonstandard solutions represent the @xmath105 minimal model of the virasoro algebra ( the ising model , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the expression in our ansatz  ( [ main ] ) is not the most general unitary field of scaling dimension 2 built from vertex operators and free boson fields .",

    "one has to reorder the boson fields in @xmath109 and in @xmath110 so that all @xmath111 are to the right and all @xmath112 are to the left .",
    "then the normal ordered parts cancel out : @xmath113 and one should stay with a number of terms proportional to the delta - function and its derivatives .    in our computations",

    "it is in fact a general feature of the kazama - suzuki models  the virasoro field is the solution for our ansatz based on a correspondent quasi root system plus one free boson .    the second example is a model based on @xmath182 matrix @xmath463 the central charge here is @xmath464 , the model represents the third unitary minimal model of the @xmath13 superconformal algebra .",
    "the virasoro field in this realization is a symmetric ( @xmath465 ) solution for our ansatz based on @xmath196 root system plus one free boson .",
    "it s also a general feature of kazama - suzuki models based on @xmath466 @xmath182 matrices with all the off - diagonal elements equal to 1 : it represents the @xmath221-th unitary minimal model of the @xmath13 superconformal algebra ( @xmath467 ) and the virasoro field is a symmetric solution for our ansatz on @xmath468 root system plus one free boson .",
    "the data for our last example is given by @xmath182 matrix @xmath469 the model is a @xmath470 unitary minimal model .",
    "the virasoro field in this realization is a sum of that of the free boson field and the @xmath471 solution  ( [ solution_qr5 ] ) for the ansatz based on a three dimensional quasi root system number 5 in appendix  [ qr_dim3 ] .",
    "further study of kazama - suzuki construction for @xmath13 superconformal algebra can be found in references  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we did nt touch the representation theory at all in this paper .",
    "however one can also build highest weight representations of the virasoro algebra using the vertex operator realization .",
    "highest weight representations will be realized as combinations of vertex operators on the lattice dual to that of the quasi root system used to construct the virasoro field .",
    "the description of highest weight representations in this framework is an interesting subject for the future development .",
    "a classification of quasi root systems is an open problem .",
    "it is very challenging to establish the classification , but we are even not sure this is feasible at all .",
    "the number of quasi root systems grows very fast with the dimension .",
    "so even if a formal scheme for enumeration of all quasi root systems existed it would probably be too complex to call it classification .",
    "one could try to restrict the consideration of quasi root systems to a certain subset using probably physical arguments coming from conformal field theory .",
    "but it is not clear what subset can be taken and what conformal field theory arguments can be used",
    ". another possible path on the way to classification is to modify the notion of simplicity of quasi root systems .",
    "then hopefully many of the quasi root systems can be knocked down to the simple subsystems .",
    "but again we do nt know what would be a meaningful modification of the notion of simplicity .",
    "another challenge is to solve the coefficient equations in a general way , i.e.  for a class of quasi root systems and not one by one .",
    "we presented the solutions for the cases of specific quasi root systems , the only exception is the general solution for the @xmath369 root systems .",
    "we even do nt know to prove in general the existence of solutions ( in real numbers ) , although our experience indicates that solutions always exist and moreover their number is quite large - grows as @xmath472 with dimension @xmath36 of the quasi root system .",
    "in general a classification of quasi root systems combined with a classification of solutions for the ansatz would probably provide a classification scheme for unitary models in two - dimensional conformal field theory , as we believe that any unitary conformal model can be bosonized , i.e.  represented in terms of free bosons and vertex operators",
    ".    there could be interesting insights to number theory ( as was suggested by victor kac ) .",
    "it is well known that the jacobi triple product identity is connected to the bosonization of free two - dimensional massless fermion .",
    "the identity can be even derived by computing the characters in two different realizations - the fermionic one and the bosonic one .",
    "our bosonization scheme of the virasoro algebra could be a source of new number theory identities similar to the jacobi triple product .",
    "but this question falls beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "we would like to make two comments on our choice of the virasoro field in the ansatz  ( [ main ] ) .",
    "the first comment is that in fact there is another type of terms of scaling dimension 2 constructed from free bosons , which is missing in our ansatz .",
    "it is the second derivative of a free boson field : @xmath473 . in conformal field theory",
    "the term has already been used to modify the canonical form of the virasoro field  ( [ canonical construction ] ) .",
    "the addition of the second derivative term also shifts the value of the central charge away from integer .",
    "the construction arises in the framework of the coulomb gas approach .",
    "it s not very difficult to show that the introduction of @xmath474 term does nt lead to a new theory .",
    "the substitution of the field @xmath475 ( where @xmath476 is the `` ansatz field '' from  ( [ main ] ) ) into virasoro commutation relation leads again to a number of quadratic equations for the coefficients .",
    "the equation at the @xmath474 term reads @xmath477 . lets choose a system of coordinates in which the vector @xmath478 is along the @xmath286-axis : @xmath479 .",
    "therefore in this coordinates the following components of matrix @xmath7 should be @xmath480",
    ". the introduction of @xmath474 term does nt affect equation  ( [ phi_phi_equation ] ) . and",
    "since @xmath481 the following expression should vanish @xmath482 this is a sum of squares of real numbers , therefore every term in the sum should be zero : @xmath483 if the coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath100 are different from zero , then all the roots @xmath484 and vectors @xmath280 have vanishing components in the direction of vector @xmath478 , so they belong to a space which is orthogonal to @xmath478 .",
    "then obviously the field @xmath4 is decomposed to the sum of two `` orthogonal '' fields : one is the standard coulomb gas expression involving one free boson in the direction of @xmath478 , another is a field in the form of our ansatz  ( [ main ] ) involving @xmath266 free bosons and vertex operators in the space orthogonal to @xmath478 . since there is no `` interaction '' between the two fields they can be studied separately .",
    "the second comment is that we have chosen the coefficients @xmath99 , @xmath100 to be real .",
    "this is of course not the most general choice for the vertex operator terms .",
    "if we allow the coefficients to be complex then the most general unitary expressions for the terms are @xmath485 where @xmath486 , @xmath100 are now a complex number and vector and @xmath487 , @xmath488 are their complex conjugates . in this case",
    "the equations for the coefficients in section  [ solutions for the ansatz : general discussion ] have to be modified a little bit .",
    "note that one can use the freedom in the definition of free bosonic fields to shift them by a constant @xmath489 to make @xmath36 coefficients real .",
    "then the modified analogues of equations  ( [ gamma_equation ] , [ lambda_equation ] ) usually force the rest of the coefficients to be real .",
    "this is certainly true for the cases of quasi - root systems that we have solved in section  [ solutions for the ansatz ] .",
    "however we havent proven in general that one can always choose all the coefficients to be real .",
    "we list below all 15 three - dimensional simple quasi root systems .",
    "there is a set of 3 simple roots in each three - dimensional simple quasi root system .",
    "one can represent each root in the quasi root system as a linear combination of simple roots with integer coefficients , such that all the coefficients are either non - negative or non - positive .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the existence of a set of simple roots is not guarantied for a general quasi root system , but all the three - dimensional quasi root systems do admit a set of simple roots . note that this set is usually not unique !",
    "we present the following information for each three - dimensional simple quasi root system : the total number of roots , the number of short and long roots separately , the simple roots ( just one choice , remember there can be more than one choice ! ) , the products between the simple roots , the diagram representing the products between the simple roots in the graphical form , and the table of all the roots .",
    "the diagrams are a bit different from the standard dynkin diagrams .",
    "filled circles represent long simple roots , unfilled circles represent short simple roots , the number of lines between two circles equals to minus the value of the product between the corresponding roots , the dashed line represents product value @xmath490 .    in the table",
    "we list the coefficients of each root in its linear decomposition to simple roots .",
