    "the genetic case - control association analysis @xcite is one of the most commonly used approaches in human disease gene mapping . in this analysis",
    ", researchers collect tissues or blood samples from patients as well as normal controls .",
    "the dna molecules are extracted from the sample for genotyping , either by microsatellite markers or single - nucleotide - polymorphism ( snp ) complete human genome is now technologically feasible ( e.g. using chips ) , and have been routinely carried out . the goal of a genetic association analysis is to locate genetic markers that exhibit significantly different allele or genotype frequencies between the patient ( case ) and the normal ( control ) group .",
    "another competing paradigm for disease gene mapping is the genetic linkage analysis @xcite . in linkage analysis ,",
    "families with multiple incidents of a disease are identified , and samples are collected for genotyping . for common ",
    "complex \" human diseases with unknown disease etiology and disease inheritance mode , one popular study design for linkage analysis is the non - parametric affected sibpair analysis . many research groups , ours included@xcite , started out by collecting affected sibpairs for genetic linkage analysis , but now plan to use these patient samples in case - control association analysis also .",
    "the transition from linkage to association analysis faces one statistical problem : for almost all statistical tests , samples are assumed to be independent .",
    "three options are available if samples are correlated : first , the independence condition is forced by picking one sample per family ; second , the independence condition is ignored while all correlated samples are included in the analysis ; third , all correlated samples are included but their correlation is accounted for in the analysis .",
    "the first option loses samples thus reduces statistical power .",
    "the second option , so - called _ naive _ estimator , is generally unbiased , but underestimates the variance , thus reporting incorrect @xmath1-values .",
    "we focus on the third option , using an approach called  naive estimator with effective sample size \" , to provide a simple solution in handling correlated samples .",
    "although the topic of correlated samples in genetic case - control association analysis is not new ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) , our approach deviates from many other publications by not using the likelihood method .",
    "the reason for this is that we would like to provide an easy solution accessible to most practitioners of genetic analysis who may or may not have a strong mathematical background .",
    "notice that besides the correlation between two relatives in a relative pair , most samples are still independent because they are from different pedigrees . in this context , although likelihood method can correctly account for correlation between multiple samples in a pedigree , the simple effective sample size approach is an excellent alternative that is easily understandable and can be applied using existing analysis programs .",
    "this article is organized as follows : we reproduce the important result that correlation among samples do not bias the allele frequency estimation ; then we calculate the variance of genotype frequency when a fixed type of relative pairs is used ; the concept of effective sample size is introduced ; the variance calculation is extended to allele frequency estimator ; the use of effective sample size in @xmath0 test statistic calculation is provided ; and the use of effective sample size in calculating confidence intervals of odd - ratio calculation is presented .",
    "before examining the effect of correlation among samples , we first discuss the quantity which is _ not _ affected by correlation : the variable mean .",
    "suppose all our samples consist of @xmath2 correlated pairs : @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the variable value for individual 1 and 2 in pair @xmath7 , such as the genotype indicator variable .",
    "an estimator of the mean using all samples , @xmath8 = \\sum_l   \\frac{e[x_l ] + e[y_l]}{2n_r } = e \\left [ \\frac{\\sum_l x_l}{n_r }   \\right],\\ ] ] is identical to the estimator using one sample per pair ( note that @xmath9 = e[y_l]$ ] ) .",
    "in other words , correlation between samples in a pair does not bias the mean estimator .",
    "the key of this proof is that correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 only enters as a product , whereas for the estimation of the mean , there is no cross - product term .    in a slightly more complicated situation , where the samples consist of singletons , correlated pairs , and correlated triples .",
    "we can write the singletons as @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , pairs as @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , and triples as @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the mean of the naive allele / genotype counting estimator using all n ( @xmath18 ) samples is : @xmath19       \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\sum_l e[x_l ] + \\sum_m ( e[x'_m]+e[y'_m ] ) + \\sum_n ( e[x''_n]+e[y''_n]+e[z''_n])}{n }    \\nonumber \\\\ & = & e[x ] = e \\left [ \\frac { \\sum_l x_l + \\sum_m x'_m + \\sum_n x''_n}{n_1+n_2+n_3 } \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , identical to the estimator using only one uncorrelated sample per group .",
    "it can be easily seen that the same conclusion holds for other more complicated situations .",
    "this general conclusion has directly consequence on the estimation of allele frequencies from pedigree data@xcite . in most pedigree analysis programs ,",
    "both options are available for estimating allele frequencies : either from all individuals or from pedigree founders only .",
    "it is acknowledged in ref .",
    "@xcite that  one will not go far wrong in simply using the data for all individuals , ignoring their relationship \" .",
    "if both naive estimator using correlated samples and that using independent samples lead to the same mean , why should we worry about the naive estimator ? there could be these concerns : for example , if singletons and pairs are collected under different conditions , a selection bias might be introduced ; and , although the means of the two estimators are the same , the variances of the two are not . for a particular dataset of finite number of samples ,",
    "estimator with a larger variance may fail to reproduce the true value .",
    "we will focus on the variance calculation next .",
    "we discuss the following situation : genotype frequencies are to be estimated from a group of relative pairs of the same type , e.g. , 500 sibpairs .",
    "the genetic marker is assumed to have two alleles , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with allele frequency @xmath1 and @xmath22 , and the three possible genotypes , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , with expected genotype frequencies of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 under hardy - weinberg equilibrium .",
