    "at low- and intermediate - energies , the parity violating weak @xmath1-@xmath1 interaction can be described in terms of a meson exchange model involving a strong interaction vertex and a weak interaction vertex ( assuming one boson exchanges ) .",
    "the strong interaction vertex is well understood ; it is represented by the conventional meson - exchange parameterization of the @xmath1-@xmath1 interaction .",
    "the weak interaction vertex is calculated from the weinberg - salam model assuming that the @xmath2- and @xmath3-bosons are exchanged between the intermediate mesons ( @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) and constituent quarks of the nucleon .",
    "the parity violating interaction can then be described in terms of seven weak meson - nucleon coupling constants .",
    "the six weak meson - nucleon coupling constants ( @xmath6 , with the superscripts indicating isospin changes and the subscripts the exchanged meson ) have been calculated by desplanques , donoghue , and holstein ( ddh ) @xcite , synthesizing the quark model and su(6 ) and treating strong interaction effects in renormalization group theory .",
    "the seventh weak meson - nucleon coupling constant @xmath7 is estimated to be smaller and is usually deleted from further consideration .",
    "ddh tabulated ` best guess values ' and ` reasonable ranges ' for the six weak meson - nucleon coupling constants . following the seminal paper by ddh",
    ", various other groups have calculated the weak meson - nucleon coupling constants , but the considerable ranges of uncertainty attached to these remain ( see ref .  2 ) .",
    "the parity violating @xmath8 vertex plays an increasingly important role in elastic and inelastic proton - proton scattering above the pion - production threshold .",
    "it is also apparent that the theoretical situation regarding @xmath9 is not settled by any means .",
    "for a recent review see also haeberli and holstein @xcite .",
    "a complete determination of the six weak meson - nucleon coupling constants demands a minimum of six experimental , linearly independent combinations of the weak meson - nucleon coupling constants . of to date there",
    "do not exist enough experimental constraints of the required precision .",
    "this situation can only be remedied by performing a set of judiciously chosen , precise parity violation experiments .",
    "precise measurements of the @xmath10-@xmath10 parity violating longitudinal analyzing power have been made at 13.6 mev @xmath11 $ ] at the university of bonn @xcite and at 45 mev @xmath12 $ ] at sin ( now psi ) @xcite . here",
    "@xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 representing the scattering cross sections for polarized incident protons of positive and negative helicity , respectively , integrated over the range of angles determined by the acceptance of the experimental apparatus in question . from the sin measurement at 45 mev and the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath13 at lower energies",
    ", one can extrapolate that at 13.6 mev @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , the two precise , low energy measurements are in excellent agreement .",
    "both results allow determining a combination of effective @xmath17 and @xmath5 weak meson - nucleon coupling constants : @xmath13 = 0.153h@xmath18 + 0.113h@xmath19 , with h@xmath20 and h@xmath21 .",
    "one should note that a measurement of @xmath13 in @xmath10-@xmath10 scattering is sensitive only to the short range part of the parity violating interaction ( parity violating @xmath22 exchange would be also cp violating and is therefore suppressed by a factor of about @xmath23 ) .",
    "a partial wave decomposition allows @xmath13 to be written as a sum of the various transition amplitudes ( @xmath24 ) , ( @xmath25 - @xmath26 ) , ( @xmath26 - @xmath27 ) , ( @xmath28 - @xmath29 ) , etc . for incident energies below 100 mev essentially only the first transition amplitude ( @xmath30 - @xmath31 ) is contributing , but for higher energies the second parity violating transition amplitude ( @xmath25 - @xmath26 ) is of increasing importance .",
    "the contribution of the next higher order ( third ) transition amplitude ( @xmath26 - @xmath27 ) is negligibly small .",
    "@xcite the triumf 221.3 mev @xmath10-@xmath10 parity violation experiment is unique in that it selected an energy where the ( @xmath30 - @xmath31 ) transition amplitude contribution integrates to zero , taking into account the angular acceptance of the apparatus .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that the @xmath30 and @xmath31 phase shifts change sign near 230 mev .",
    "simonius @xcite has shown that the ( @xmath25 - @xmath32 transition amplitude depends only weakly on @xmath5 exchange ( to an extent depending on the strong vector meson - nucleon coupling constants ) .",
    "consequently , the triumf 221.3 mev experiment presents a determination of @xmath33 . in the triumf experiment a 200 na",
    "proton beam with a polarization of 0.80 is incident on a 0.40 m long lh@xmath34 target , after extraction from the optically pumped polarized ion source ( oppis ) , passing a wien filter in the injection beam line , acceleration through the cyclotron to an energy of 221.3 mev , and multiturn extraction by a stripping foil .",
    "a combination of solenoid - dipole - solenoid - dipole magnets on the external beam line provides a longitudinally polarized beam with either positive or negative helicity or vice versa .",
    "@xmath13 follows from the helicity dependence of the @xmath10-@xmath10 total cross section as determined in precise measurements of the normalized transmission asymmetry through the 0.40 long lh@xmath34 target : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the incident beam longitudinal polarization , @xmath37 is the average transmission through the target , and the + and - signs indicate the helicity .",
    "very strict constraints are imposed on the incident longitudinally polarized beam in terms of intensity , transverse horizontal ( x ) and vertical ( y ) beam position and direction , beam width ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , longitudinal polarization ( @xmath40 ) , transverse polarization ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) , first moments of the transverse polarization ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , and energy , together with deviations of the transmission measuring apparatus from cylindrical symmetry .",
    "helicity correlated modulations in the beam parameters originate at oppis , but can be amplified by the beam transport through the injection beam line , the cyclotron accelerator , and the extraction beam line .",
    "residual systematic errors arising from the imperfections of the incident beam and of the response of the transmission measuring apparatus , are individually not to exceed one - tenth of the expected value of @xmath13 ( or @xmath45 ) .",
    "particular troublesome are the first moments of residual transverse polarization , as well as helicity correlated changes in energy .",
    "the approach which has been followed is to further measure the sensitivity or response to residual imperfections , to monitor these imperfections during data taking , and to make corrections where necessary .",
    "random changes in the incident beam parameters cause a dilution of the effect to be measured and therefore necessitate longer data taking times .",
    "details about the experimental arrangements and procedures can be found in ref .  2 , while an account of the data analysis will be reported elsewhere .",

    "@xcite its interpretation in terms of the effective @xmath17 and @xmath5 weak meson - nucleon coupling constants is more difficult due to the presence of a large inelasticity ( pion production ) .",

    "@xcite this result is an order of magnitude larger than what is expected based upon using simple scaling arguments .",
    "new @xmath10-@xmath10 parity violation experiments are being planned at triumf possibly at 450 mev and with cosy at the forschungszentrum jlich near 2 gev as a storage ring experiment .",
    "other @xmath1-@xmath1 parity violation measurements have dealt with the circular polarization @xmath51 of the @xmath52-rays in @xmath53-@xmath10 capture and with the asymmetry @xmath54 in @xmath53-@xmath10 capture with polarized cold neutrons , as well as the inverse reaction , deuteron photodisintegration with circularly polarized @xmath52-rays . however , these experiments were not of enough statistical precision to have an impact on the determination of @xmath9 .",
    "a new measurement of @xmath54 is being prepared at lansce , aiming at a ten - fold improvement in accuracy ( to a precision of @xmath55 , which will determine @xmath9 to @xmath56.@xcite in the experiment , neutrons from the pulsed spallation source are moderated by a lh@xmath34 moderator , and their energy determined by time - of - flight .",
    "the cold neutrons are polarized by transmission through polarized @xmath57he gas ; the neutron spin direction can be subsequently reversed by a rf resonance flipper .",

    "@xcite the latter two experiments are designed to resolve the experimental discrepancy between the value of @xmath9 as deduced from measurements of the circularly polarized 1.081  mev @xmath52-rays from the well known parity - mixed doublet in @xmath58f @xcite and as deduced from the measurements of the anapole moment    fig",

    "a more recently reported result is a large asymmetry in the distribution of @xmath65 events in the cp - odd / t - odd angle @xmath66 between the decay planes of the @xmath67 and @xmath68 pairs in the @xmath69 center of mass system .",
    "the overall asymmetry found was @xmath70% .",
    "@xcite this raises the question about time - reversal - invariance non - conservation in systems other than the kaon system .",
    "tests of time - reversal - invariance can be distinguished as belonging to two classes : the first one deals with p - odd / t - odd interactions , while the second one deals with p - even / t - odd interactions ( assuming cpt conservation this implies c - conjugation non - conservation ) .",
    "but it is to be noted that constraints on these two classes of interactions are not independent since the effects due to p - odd / t - odd interactions may also be produced by p - even / t - odd interactions in conjunction with standard model parity violating radiative corrections .",
    "the latter can occur at the @xmath71 level and may present a limit on the constraint of a p - even / t - odd interaction derived from experiment .",
    "limits on a p - odd / t - odd interaction follow from measurements of the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron ( which currently stands at @xmath72 e.cm [ 95% c.l . ] ) .",
    "this provides a limit on a p - odd / t - odd pion - nucleon coupling constant which is less than 10@xmath73 times the weak interaction strength .",
    "measurements of @xmath74xe and @xmath75hg edm s ( @xmath76 e.cm [ 95% c.l . ] ) give similar constraints .",
    "[ see ref .",
    "20 ]    experimental limits on a p - even / t - odd interaction are much less stringent . following the conventional approach of describing the @xmath1-@xmath1 interaction in terms of meson exchanges , it can be shown that only charged rho - meson exchange and a@xmath77-meson exchange can lead to a p - even / t - odd interaction .",
    "@xcite the better constraints stem first from measurements of the edm of the neutron and second from measurements of charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) in @xmath53-@xmath10 elastic scattering .",
    "haxton , hoering , and ramsay - musolf @xcite have deduced constraints on a p - even / t - odd interaction from nucleon , nuclear , and atomic edm s with the better constraint coming from the measurement of the edm of the neutron . in terms of a ratio to the strong rho - meson nucleon coupling constant , they deduced for the p - even / t - odd rho - meson nucleon coupling : @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "but as indicated above there exists great uncertainty about the value of @xmath9 ; the ratio of the theoretical to experimental value of @xmath9 may be as large as 15 !",
    "@xcite however , constraints derived from one - loop contributions to the edm of the neutron exceed the two - loop limits by more than an order of magnitude and are much more stringent .",
    "@xcite it is to be noted that a translation in terms of coupling strengths in the hadronic sector still needs to be made .",
    "it is very difficult to accommodate a p - even / t - odd interaction in the standard model .",
    "it requires c - conjugation non - conservation , which can not be introduced at the first generation quark level .",
    "it can neither be introduced into the gluon self - interaction .",
    "consequently , one needs to consider c - conjugation non - conservation between quarks of different generations and/or between interacting fields .",
    "@xcite    charge symmetry breaking in @xmath53-@xmath10 elastic scattering manifests itself as a non - zero difference of the neutron ( @xmath80 ) and proton ( @xmath81 ) analyzing powers , @xmath82/\\sigma_0 $ ] . here",
    "the complex amplitude @xmath83 is charge symmetry breaking , while the complex amplitude @xmath84 is both charge symmetry breaking and time - reversal - invariance non - conserving .",
    "the complex amplitudes @xmath85 and @xmath86 belong to the usual five @xmath53-@xmath10 scattering amplitudes and @xmath87 is the unpolarized differential cross section .",
    "the three precision experiments performed ( at triumf at 477 mev @xcite and at 347 mev @xcite , and at iucf at 183 mev @xcite ) have unambiguously shown that charge symmetry is broken and that the results for @xmath88 at the zero - crossing of the average analyzing are very well reproduced by meson exchange model calculations .",
    "( see fig .",
    "3 ) a p - even / t - odd interaction introduces a term in the scattering amplitude which is simultaneously charge symmetry breaking ( the complex amplitude @xmath84 in the above expression ) .",
    "thus , simonius @xcite deduced an upper limit on a p - even / t - odd interaction from a comparison of the three experimental results with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the upper limit so derived is @xmath89 [ 95% c.l . ] .",
    "this result is therefore comparable to the upper limit deduced from the edm of the neutron , taking the current experimental value of @xmath59 extracted from @xmath58f , and is considerably lower than the limits inferred from direct tests of a p - even / t - odd interaction . even though it is inconceivable in the standard model to account for a p - even / t - odd interaction ,",

    "the inner error bars present the statistical uncertainties ; the outer error bars have the systematic uncertainties included ( added in quadrature ) .",
    "for details see ref .  25 .",
    "a better experimental constraint may be provided by an improved upper limit on the electric dipole moment of the neutron .",
    "indeed a new measurement with a sensitivity of @xmath90 e.cm has been proposed at lansce .",
    "@xcite this would constitute a more than two orders of magnitude improvement over the present upper limit . performing",
    "an improved @xmath53-@xmath10 elastic scattering csb experiment also appears to be an attractive possibility .",
    "one can calculate with a great deal of accuracy the contributions to csb due to one - photon exchange and due to the @xmath53-@xmath10 mass difference affecting one - pion and rho - meson exchange .",
    "furthermore , one can select an energy where the @xmath91 meson mixing contribution changes sign at the same angle where the average analyzing power changes sign and therefore does not contribute to @xmath88 .",
    "this occurs at an incident neutron energy of 320 mev and is caused by the particular interplay of the @xmath53-@xmath10 phase shifts and the form of the spin / isospin operator connected with the @xmath91 mixing term .",
    "also the one - photon exchange term at 320 mev changes sign at about the same angle as the average of the analyzing powers .",
    "the contribution due to two - pion exchange with an intermediate @xmath92 is expected to be less than one tenth of the overall @xmath88 , essentially determining an upper limit on the theoretical uncertainty .",

    "4 ) @xcite it has been shown that simultaneous @xmath93 exchanges can only contribute to @xmath88 through second order processes and can therefore be neglected .",
    "@xcite at 320 mev the effects of inelasticity ( pion production ) are negligibly small .",
    "it appears therefore well within reach to reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the comparison of theory with experiment .",
    "both the statistical and systematic errors , obtained in the 347 mev triumf experiment , can be considerably improved upon ( by a factor three to four ) . with the developments of optically pumped polarized ion sources which have taken place in the intervening years",

    "in addition various systematic error reducing improvements can be introduced .",
    "such an experiment would constitute a measurement of csb in @xmath53-@xmath10 elastic scattering of unprecedented precision of great value of its own and would simultaneously provide a greatly improved upper limit on a p - even / t - odd interaction .",
    "the structure of the nucleon at low energies in terms of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom is not well understood .",
    "of particular interest are the two proton ground state matrix elements which are sensitive to point - like  strange \" quarks and hence to the quark - antiquark sea in the proton .",
    "the two matrix elements of interest are the elastic scattering vector weak neutral current ` charge ' and ` magnetic ' form factors , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "these form factors can be deduced from parity violating electron - proton elastic scattering measurements .",
    "assuming charge symmetry , i.e. , the proton and neutron differ only by the interchange of the  up \" and  down \" quarks , one can determine the  up \" ,  down `` , and ' ' strange \" quark contributions to the ` charge ' and ` magnetic ' form factors of the nucleon .",
    "these contributions would result from taking the appropriate linear combinations of the weak neutral form factors and their electromagnetic counterparts .",
    "determinations of both the ` charge ' and ` magnetic '  strange \" quark form factors , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , would constitute the first direct information on the quark sea in low energy observables .",
    "electron - proton parity violation experiments are to determine these contributions to the proton form factors at the few percent level .",
    "high energy experiments suggest that the  strange \" quarks carry about half as much momentum as the  up \" and  down \" quarks in the sea .",
    "the matrix elements , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , are also of relevance to discussions of the ellis - jaffe sum rule and the @xmath99 sigma term ; there is uncertainty in both of these about the  strange \" quark contributions .",

    "<S> measurements of parity - violating longitudinal analyzing powers ( normalized asymmetries ) in polarized proton - proton scattering and asymmetries in polarized neutron capture on the proton provide a unique window on the interplay between the weak and strong interactions of hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> several new proton - proton parity violation experiments are presently either being performed or are being prepared for execution in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> a new measurement of the parity - violating gamma - ray asymmetry with a ten - fold improvement over previous measurements is being developed . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments are intended to provide stringent constraints on the set of seven effective weak meson - nucleon coupling constants , which characterize the weak interaction between hadrons in the energy domain where meson exchange models provide a proven description of the nucleon - nucleon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> time - reversal - invariance non - conservation has for the first time been unequivocally demonstrated in a direct measurement at cplear . </S>",
    "<S> what then about tests of time - reversal - invariance non - conservation in systems other than the kaon system ? there exist two classes of time - reversal - invariance breaking interactions : p - odd / t - odd and p - even / t - odd interactions . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on the first ones stem from measurements of the electric dipole moment of the neutron , while constraints on the second ones stem from the same and measurements of charge symmetry breaking in neutron - proton elastic scattering and from @xmath0 semi - leptonic decays . </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic and neutral weak interactions probe the pointlike structure of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a direct comparison can be made between the electromagnetic and neutral weak ground state currents of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> this allows a delineation of the contributions to these currents of the various quark flavours , e.g. , strange - antistrange quark pairs , which belong exclusively to the nucleon sea . a series of precision experiments , either ongoing or being prepared , will determine the neutral weak current of the proton by measuring the parity - violating normalized asymmetry in electron - proton elastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of these precision experiments to very low momentum transfer would permit stringent limits to be placed on physics beyond the standard model . </S>"
