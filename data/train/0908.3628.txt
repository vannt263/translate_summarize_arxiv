    "the classical giambelli formula @xcite is one of the fundamental results concerning schubert calculus in the cohomology ring of the usual grassmannian @xmath4 .",
    "the cohomology of @xmath4 has an additive basis of schubert classes , and is generated as a ring by certain _",
    "special _ schubert classes , which are the chern classes of the universal quotient bundle over @xmath4 .",
    "the formula of giambelli writes a general schubert class as a determinant of a jacobi - trudi matrix with entries given by special classes .",
    "the giambelli problem can be formulated for any homogeneous space @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is a classical complex lie group and @xmath1 a parabolic subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "one can choose as schubert class generators for the cohomology ring @xmath3 the pullbacks of the special schubert classes on grassmannians ; typically these will be the chern classes of the tautological quotient bundles over @xmath2 .",
    "the question then is to find an explicit combinatorial formula which expresses a general schubert class in @xmath3 as a polynomial in the special classes .",
    "we proceed to give a brief survey of the work to date on the giambelli problem for such homogeneous spaces .",
    "the case of the full flag variety @xmath5 , where the cohomology is generated by schubert divisors , is more amenable to study .",
    "note that in general , the giambelli polynomials are only defined up to the ideal of relations generated by the invariant polynomials under the action of the weyl group of @xmath0 .",
    "bernstein - gelfand - gelfand @xcite and demazure @xcite used divided difference operators to construct an algorithm that produces polynomials which represent the schubert classes . for the general linear group ,",
    "lascoux and schtzenberger @xcite applied this method to define _",
    "schubert polynomials _ , a particularly nice choice of representatives with rich combinatorial properties .",
    "an explicit combinatorial formula for the coefficients of schubert polynomials was given by billey , jockusch , and stanley @xcite  thus resolving the giambelli question in the case of the complete flag variety in type a. this was generalized to arbitrary @xmath6 partial flag varieties by buch , kresch , yong , and the author @xcite .",
    "in the other classical lie types , one considers the varieties which parametrize flags of subspaces of a vector space which are isotropic with respect to an orthogonal or symplectic form .",
    "pragacz @xcite found an explicit giambelli formula for the maximal isotropic grassmannians , in the form of a schur pfaffian @xcite . at the other extreme , for the full flag varieties",
    "@xmath5 in types b , c , and d , the analogous theory of schubert polynomials is not uniquely determined ( see @xcite for examples ) and their combinatorics is more challenging .",
    "giambelli formulas for non - maximal isotropic grassmannians were discovered only recently @xcite . unlike most previously known examples , the nature of the formulas in loc .",
    "is not determinantal ",
    "instead , they are expressed using young s raising operators @xcite . in the present work we will generalize these results to settle the giambelli problem for any classical @xmath2 space (",
    "when @xmath0 is an even orthogonal group , the problem is reduced to the main result of @xcite ) .",
    "one of our motivations for this is the fact that all the known giambelli formulas expressed in terms of special schubert classes have straightforward  often identical  extensions to the small quantum cohomology ring of @xmath2 ; see @xcite .",
    "we expect that our new giambelli formulas will similarly prove to be the right ones to look at in the quantum world .",
    "the modern formulation of the giambelli problem is in the setting of an algebraic family of varying partial flag varieties , with applications to _ degeneracy loci _ of vector bundles .",
    "this story also has a long history , from the work of thom - porteous and kempf - laksov @xcite to the generalizations by fulton , pragacz , and others @xcite ; see @xcite for expositions .",
    "it has been known at least since the paper of graham @xcite that the degeneracy locus problem for the classical groups from @xcite is equivalent to the giambelli problem for the schubert classes in the _",
    "@xmath7-equivariant cohomology _ of @xmath2 , where @xmath7 denotes the maximal torus in @xmath0 . in type",
    "a , the project culminated with the combinatorial understanding of the polynomials representing quiver loci @xcite .",
    "fulton asked in @xcite for degeneracy locus formulas which have a similar shape for all the classical groups ; moreover , that the formulas should be determinantal whenever possible .",
    "we give a complete answer to this question here , except that in addition to determinants we also require the raising operator giambelli polynomials from @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the results provide a combinatorial link between the general @xmath2 giambelli problem and the quiver formulas of @xcite .",

    "we work with the schubert polynomials of billey and haiman @xcite , and more generally with their double versions introduced by ikeda , mihalcea , and naruse @xcite .",
    "these objects have many of the properties of the type a schubert polynomials , but their connection with the geometry is less clear .",

    "the point is that the flag of subspaces @xmath39 in ( [ eseq ] ) need not contain a lagrangian ( i.e. , a maximal isotropic ) subspace . in terms of the weyl group , this is simply the fact that the first descent position of a signed permutation @xmath18 need not be at _",

    "it would be interesting to have tableau formulas for the @xmath32 , analogous to the ones in @xcite for quiver coefficients .",
    "this article is organized so that most of the exposition is in type c ; a final section explains the analogous picture in types b and d. we review the schur , theta , and schubert polynomials , as well as the stanley symmetric functions we require in  [ prelims ] .",
