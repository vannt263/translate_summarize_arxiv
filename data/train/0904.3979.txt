    "if we look at the petrie matrix @xmath38 from the algebraic point of view , it seems that we have known all interesting things about it *",
    "@xcite*. so , what else is special about it that warrants the further study ?",
    "this answer comes from the dynamical systems point of view .",
    "although the definition of @xmath38 may seem opaque , its study * @xcite * is quite common in the theory of discrete dynamical systems on the interval : if we define the linearization of @xmath21 on @xmath3 to be the _ continuous _ map @xmath48 from @xmath20 $ ] into itself such that @xmath49 for all integers @xmath50 and @xmath48 is _ linear _ on @xmath51 for all integers @xmath23 and take @xmath51 s as the vertices of a directed graph and draw an arrow from the vertex @xmath51 to the vertex @xmath52 if @xmath53 , then @xmath38 will be the adjacency matrix [ @xmath54 , p.17 ] of the resulting directed graph .",
    "for example , if @xmath55 denotes the cyclic permutation @xmath56 on @xmath57 ( see figure 1 ) , then the adjacency matrix @xmath58 of the corresponding directed graph is given as @xmath59whose characteristic polynomial is @xmath60 .",
    "you may have noticed that the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath58 are all _ odd _ numbers .",
    "this is no coincidence .",
    "it has been shown in * @xcite * that if @xmath21 is a _ cyclic _",
    "permutation on @xmath3 then the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix @xmath38 of the directed graph of @xmath48 are all _ odd _ numbers and hence nonzero .",
    "this adjacency matrix @xmath38 turns out to contain many information on the dynamical properties of the map @xmath48 such as its topological entropy * @xcite * and artin - mazur zeta function * @xcite * which are topological invariants . in * @xcite",
    "* , when we study the artin - mazur zeta function of @xmath48 for some cyclic permutation @xmath21 , we are surprised to see that , for some cyclic permutations @xmath21 and @xmath61 , although @xmath48 and @xmath62 are not topologically conjugate , they still have the same artin - mazur zeta function .",
    "further study reveals that it is because the adajcency matrices of their respective directed graphs are similar .",
    "when we re - examined theorem 2 of * @xcite * a few years ago , we found something interesting hidden behind the theorem ( cf .",
    "theorem 7 below ) .",
    "this initiates the investigation of the one - sided and two - sided similarities and weak similarities of permutations .",
    "our results on permutations may be complementary from the perspective of discrete dynamical systems on the interval to the book _",
    "combinatorics on permutations _ by m. bna * @xcite*.    for convenience , in the sequel , for any set @xmath63 of @xmath13 vectors in @xmath19 , we shall write @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and call this @xmath66 matrix @xmath67 the matrix of @xmath68 ( with respect to the standard basis @xmath69 ) and denote it as @xmath70 . for any finitely",

    ", we can compare the characteristic polynomials and discuss the matrix similarity of their corresponding extended petrie matrices .",
