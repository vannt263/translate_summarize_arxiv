    "the x - ray emission from clusters of galaxies is mainly due to hot and diffuse intra - cluster gas with @xmath11 k and a central density of @xmath12 ( see the excellent review by sarazin 1986 ) + this hot intracluster gas is the main baryon component of clusters of galaxies : its mass is several times that of the stellar mass @xmath13 ( david _ et al .",

    "is the baryon fraction the same in all clusters ? in the standard picture of cluster formation driven solely by gravitational instability and where cluster evolution is entirely self - similar , the expected baryon fraction should be constant , because no segregation between the gas and dark matter has occured .",
    "however , if we gather all the derived baryon fractions in the literature and compare them , the answer is clearly no .",
    "for example the derived mean values of wf and djf samples are different , 15% for the former and 20% for the later ( but see evrard 1997 ) .",
    "more recently , lowenstein & mushotzky ( 1996 ) have shown evidence of variations in baryon fraction from their analysis of two poor abell clusters , a1060 and awm 7 , using the most recent x - ray observations from rosat and asca ( figure 2 ) . such variation in baryon fraction from cluster to cluster",

    "galaxies and hot gas are only a small part of the total cluster mass .",
    "the dominant component is the dark matter .",
    "zwicky in 1933 then smith ( 1936 ) have shown that the virial mass exceeds by a large factor the luminous mass .",
    "this led them to invoke for the first time , the problem of missing mass . to quantify the amount of dark matter",

    "so , if one believes in a matter dominated flat cosmological model @xmath35 , then where is the missing mass ?",
    "still now we do not know how the dark matter is distributed relatively to the visible matter .",
    "cluster mass determinations using optical observations are based on the assumption that mass follows the light distribution which is just an assumption not yet confirmed . what are the predictions on the mass distribution ?",
    "cosmological theories predict that dark matter is more diffusely distributed than galaxies .",
    "west and richstone using n - body simulations have indeed confirmed this behaviour ( west & richstone 1988 ) .",
    "furtheremore hughes ( 1989 ) , using x - ray observations of the coma cluster , has shown that models where dark matter parallels the distribution of hot gas are ruled out by the data . with the improvement of weak lensing analysis , one may hope that this question will be answered more precisely , in the near future .",
    "in this section , i will review the methods used to estimate clusters masses and will discuss their validity .",
    "+        :    early estimates of cluster masses ( before x - ray observations became possible ) were based on the application of the virial theorem .",
    "if one assumes that clusters of galaxies are bound and self - gravitating systems then the _ virial _ mass is given by :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are evaluated from the radial velocity distribution ( 2 ) and the projected spatial distribution of a fair sample of galaxies . as we have seen the naive application of equation(4 )",
    "leads to large amounts of dark matter .",
    "therefore the question we want to address here is : how secure are the virial mass estimates ?",
    "projection effects , contamination by foreground galaxies and anisotropy of the velocity distribution may introduce uncertainties into the determination of the mass .",
    "but they are small effects and can not explain such large virial masses .",
    "several observations at both optical and x - rays wavelengths provide convincing evidence of the presence of substructure in a large sample of clusters ( baier 1983 , bird , 1994 , mohr _ et al .",
    "x - ray imaging observations with the einstein satellite first revealed such complex structure ( forman _ et al .",
    "_ 1981 ) in contrast to the smooth shape assumed in previous studies .",
    "even clusters that exhibit a fairly smooth and apparently well - relaxed configuration , like the coma cluster , have been found to contain substructure ( fitchett & webster 1987 , mellier _ et al . _ 1988 ) with a large subcluster centered on ngc 4839 that appears to be falling into the coma cluster .",
    "if this subclustering is not correctly taken into account , this would introduce large uncertainties in the dynamical mass . a substructure with 10% of the mass",
    "can introduce an underestimation of 40% on the mlr .",
    "+ however , the most serious problem of using the virial theorem comes from the fact that we do not know how the dark matter is distributed .",
    "indeed , the application of the standard virial theorem assumes that mass follows the light distribution .",
    "what happens when this assumption is relaxed ?",
    "it has been shown ( sadat 1995 ) that in this case the standard application of the virial theorem introduces a bias on the cluster masses , and this bias ( @xmath39 ) depends strongly and in a non - linear way on the relative concentrations of the visible and invisible components .",
    "it is found that the cluster mass is over-(under ) estimated if the dark matter is more ( less ) concentrated by an amount @xmath40}{[1+c{_v}r_{\\sl true}]},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the true ratio of the masses @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the relative concentrations of the 2 components . as an illustration of this effect we have plotted in figure 3 the bias @xmath46 versus @xmath41 in the case where the dark matter is less concentrated than the galaxies .",
    "figure 3 shows that for a ratio of , say , @xmath47 , the virial theorem leads to a dynamical ratio @xmath20 to 7 times lower . in this case",
    "the virial mass determination underestimates the true mass , while in the case where the dark matter is more concentrated ( figure 4 ) the dynamical ratio reaches the value of @xmath46 @xmath48 which is 3 times higher than the true value @xmath49!. the true mass is overestimated .",
    "note , that in the mass- follows- light case , @xmath50 and @xmath46= 1 + @xmath41 .",
    "if one defines a new quantity @xmath51 which measures the virial estimated ratio of dark matter mass to visible mass , one can see that in this case @xmath52 and therefore that the virial mass is equal to the true mass .",
    "it seems clear from this analysis , that as long as we do not know anything on the distribution of dark versus visible matter , one has to be `` sceptical '' about the masses derived from the `` virial '' method .",
    "+      if the system is in equilibrium , one can use the equation of stellar hydrodynamics to derive the mass + @xmath53\\right].\\ ] ]    for isotropic orbits , @xmath54 = @xmath55 , there would be a unique solution . unfortunately the orbits of the galaxies are poorly known .",
    "therefore , we have to solve this equation with three unknown quantities : @xmath56 , @xmath57 and m(r ) .",
    "generally , it is assumed that either @xmath58 and m(r ) are known functions and then derive @xmath59 and @xmath56 from eq .",
    "( 6 ) which are consistent with observations .",
    "unfortunately , the observed velocity dispersion profiles of clusters of galaxies are poorly known and can not put strong constraints on the mass . indeed , even for the best studied coma cluster , merritt ( 1994 ) has shown that the observed velocity dispersion profile of this cluster is consistent with several mass distributions .",
    "problems encountered with optical methods like the shapes of galaxy orbits , the small number of galaxies in a cluster , effects of contamination and projection can be avoided by using the observations of the hot x - ray emitting gas . the gas can be treated as an isotropic fluid , since the elastic collision times for ions and electrons are much shorter than the timescales for cooling and heating .",
    "the timescale required for a sound wave in the intracluster gas to cross a cluster is given by @xmath60^{-1/2 } [ r/1 mpc]$ ] gyr .",
    "+ furtheremore , since this time is shorter than the dynamical time of the cluster ( @xmath61 gyr ) , the gas can be assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium with the cluster potential ( sarazin 1986 ) .",
    "+ under the assumption of spherical symmetry the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( balance between the pressure and the gravitational forces ) can be solved for the mass interior to r , m(r ) : + @xmath62,\\ ] ] where @xmath63(r ) and @xmath64(r ) are the temperature and the gas density profiles , k is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath46 @xmath65 is the mean molecular weight of the gas . in principle , the knowledge of @xmath63 and @xmath64 from the observations , directly yields the actual mass distribution m(r ) .",
    "this method has several advantages over the optical approach .",
    "the gas is isotropic , there are no contamination effects and the most important advantage is that the mass distribution is derived directly without any assumption about the dark matter distribution as is the case with the optical method . + the sad point is that one must recover three dimensional profiles from projected profiles .",
    "for the temperature information , this requires the measurement of @xmath63(r ) which is still very difficult to obtain , even with the asca satellite . in practice , we assume that the gas is isothermal at a mean temperature @xmath66 . numerical simulations ( evrard 1996 ) and recent asca results ( ikebe _",
    "1994 ) seem to support this assumption at least out to a radius of 1.5 mpc .",

    "they argue that the hydrostatic equilibrium equation is unstable and , using a monte - carlo procedure , that the resulting accuracy of the mass estimates is rather poor ; larger than generally claimed .",
    "applying their procedure to the coma cluster , they find a factor of at least 2 uncertainty in the mass inside the abell radius , even when the measurement of the temperature is improved using rosat data ( figure 6 ) .",

    "gravitational lensing provides a very powerful tool to directly measure the projected mass distribution .",
    "this method , presents many advantages over the x - ray mass estimates , for example , it does not require any assumption on the mass distribution or on the dynamical state of the cluster . since the pionnering work by tyson _",

    "detailed study of image formation through gravitational lensing can be found in the review by schneider , ehlers and falco ( 1992 ) and fort & mellier ( 1994 ) .",
    "i will just summary very briefly the manifestations of the lensing effect and the way the lensing masses are derived .",
    "the lensing effects can be divided into two main regimes depending on the lens configuration : + 1-_the strong lensing regime _ : + the distorsion of distant galaxies by foreground clusters of galaxies gives rise to the spectacular strong arcs observed in the central regions of clusters e.g. a370 corresponding to a large magnification and strong distorsion .",

    "+ 2-_the weak lensing regime or weak shear _ : + the first observational detection using optical galaxies as sources is due to tyson , valdes and wenk ( 1990 ) . in this case , each source produces only one image which experiences only a weak distorion of its shape .",
    "+ the strong lensing regime constrains the total mass enclosed within the `` einstein radius '' , while weak shear effects determine the distribution of the mass at the outer regions ( see brainherd in these proceedings ) .",
    "the projected cluster mass within the einstein radius @xmath84 of arc or arclet can be easily derived if one assumes a spherical matter distribution for the lensing cluster and assuming that the system observer - lens - source is aligned along the line of sight + @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the critical mass density with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 being the distance to the source ( the galaxy ) , distance between the source and the lensing cluster and the distance between the source and the cluster respectively . for more complex configurations ,",
    "cluster masses are estimated by lens modelling ( see fort & mellier 1994 for a review ) .",
    "this method , however gives the mass inside the radius where the arcs are observed which are usually very small @xmath9 kpc . +      to construct the surface mass density profile one uses the statistic suggested by ( fahlman _ et al .",

    "this method has been successfully applied to several clusters ( see table 1 ) .",
    "how reliable is the lensing method ?",
    "the main shortcomings of the lensing method is that the application of equation ( 14 ) requires an estimation of @xmath92 and therefore the knowledge of the redshift of the sources which is difficult to obtain .",
    "this may introduce large uncertainty in the mass especially for distant clusters . on the other hand",
    "it is not possible to obtain a true value of the mass only from the shear map , even in the best case where the sources redshift is known because of the degeneracy due to the fact that the addition of a constant mass plane does not induce any shear on background galaxies .",
    "this degeneracy may be broken by measuring the magnification @xmath46 of the background which gives an absolute measurement of the mass .",
    "( 1995 ) have proposed a very nice method to measure @xmath46 by comparing the number count in a lensed and unlensed field .",
    "they find that depending on the slope of the number count in the reference field s = dlogn(m)/dm , they observe more or fewer objects in the lensed field . in the case",
    "where blue galaxies are selected , the counts are unaltered , since the slope is in this case equal to the critical value s=0.4 .",
    "this method has been applied successfully to the cluster a1689 by broadhurst ( 1995 ) .",

    "miralda - escud & babul ( 1995 ) have raised an interesting puzzle .",
    "they found from their analysis of abell clusters a2218 , a1689 that the mass in the central part of the cluster inferred from the strong lensing method is greater than that derived from the x - ray method by a factor of 2 - 2.5 .",
    "wu & fang have gathered all the clusters for which the mass has been estimated and compared the x - ray to lensing masses .",
    "they have found a systematic discrepancy between the two masses at small radius @xmath93 @xmath94 mpc which vanishes at larger radii .",
    "however the lensing and the x - ray information in their sample do not come from the same cluster .",
    "early studies based on both optical and lensing observations have led to the same conclusion : there is a cluster mass discrepancy by the same factor ( wu  fang 1994 , fahlman _",

    "dynamical analysis of clusters of galaxies have led to two important results : the presence of large amount of dark matter and the evidence of high baryonic fraction , both have implications on cosmology through @xmath0 and @xmath102 , the density of the universe and its baryon content respectively . estimating the masses of clusters of galaxies , is not straightforward , because it depends on the validity of the assumptions underlying the method from which the mass is determined , the _ mass - follows - light _ in the case of the _ virial _ masses , the hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermality of the gas for the x - ray mass determination .",
    "gravitational lensing methods provide with a new strong tool to constrain both the amount of mass and its distribution . comparing the x - rays to lensing masses give rise , at least in the inner part of the cluster , to the mass discrepancy problem",
    ". the most probable explanation , would be the underestimation of the x - ray mass .",
    "the interesting implication , is that clusters would be more massive than we think , and the ratio of gas mass to total mass ( the fraction of baryons ) could be in more better agreement with nucleosynthesis predictions and an @xmath103=1 universe .",
    "finally , thanks to new recent set of observations , it appears that _ virial _ masses are in good agreement with the lensing masses ( wu & fang 1997 ) , if this result is true , that means that the virial masses are accurate and one may conclude that indeed , the mass follows light , since it is only in this case that the _ virial _ method gives accurate mass determination ( sadat 1995 ) . +   +",
