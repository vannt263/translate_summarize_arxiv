    "decays of @xmath11-hadrons ( ( @xmath1 ) to open charm are of great interest both in the context of @xmath12 violation studies and of qcd studies of heavy - quark dynamics . in particular , the angle @xmath10 of the ckm unitarity triangle can be determined from @xmath13 , where @xmath6 and @xmath14 decay to a common final state , thanks to the interference of @xmath15 and @xmath16 tree - level transitions . in addition",
    ", the abundant and predictable relative rate of suitable decays to open - charm can be used to measure the production fractions of different @xmath11 meson and baryon species .",
    "since all @xmath11-hadron species are produced in @xmath17 collisions at the lhc , these measurements are needed to normalise measurements of @xmath18 and @xmath19 branching fractions to those of known @xmath20 or @xmath3 decays , and to determine absolute branching fractions .",
    "in these proceedings , we report on the most recent results from lhcb using data accumulated in 2010 , and in the early months of the 2011 run . in section  [ charged ] , we describe preliminary measurements on the road of a precise determination of @xmath10 with charged @xmath21 decays . in section",
    "[ strange ] , we present two different measurements of the @xmath22 production fraction , with semileptonic and fully hadronic decays , which combined give the most accurate determination of @xmath23 . finally , in section  [ baryons ] , we present the first observation of the @xmath24 decay and a hint of the neutral beauty strange baryon @xmath25 , also reconstructed in the @xmath26 final state .",
    "the lhcb experiment has been designed to study decays of @xmath11-hadrons from @xmath17 collisions at the lhc .",
    "the detector has been described elsewhere  @xcite . here , we just mention the salient experimental features which are critical for the measurement of @xmath10 and are common to many hadronic decays to open - charm . above all , since sensitivity to @xmath10 arises from the interference of the @xmath27 with the suppressed @xmath15 amplitude , a large data sample is mandatory",
    ". it is ensured by : the high integrated luminosity that the lhc delivers , the large @xmath28 cross - section within the lhcb detector acceptance , and a dedicated and flexible trigger , which can select efficiently @xmath11-hadron decays .",
    "the vertex detector and the tracking system also play a crucial role : a momentum resolution smaller than 1% and clear separation of secondary vertices from the primary vertex enable the separation of @xmath11-hadron decays from different sources of background components , both prompt , from the primary vertex , and non - prompt , due to long - lived hadron decays other than signal .",
    "in addition , the excellent pion - kaon separation over a wide momentum range , provided by two rich detectors , is vital to distinguish the different @xmath1 and @xmath29 decays of interest .",
    "for example , it is necessary to separate @xmath30 , from the about ten times more abundant @xmath31 in the measurements of @xmath10 using charged @xmath30 decays . indicates a superposition of @xmath6 and @xmath14 . ]",
    "despite the impressive achievements by experiments at @xmath21-factories and the tevatron , the ckm angle @xmath10 is still the least well - determined angle of the unitarity triangle .",
    "the current average of direct measurements of @xmath10 has an uncertainty of about @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this precision can be significantly improved at lhcb in the near future .    already now",
    ", the 2010 and early 2011 lhcb data - sets are sufficient to set constraints on the @xmath12 asymmetries and measure the ratio of branching fractions of the most sensitive @xmath30 decay over the favoured @xmath31 mode .",
    "these measurements demonstrate the capability of lhcb in three well - established methods for extracting @xmath10 : the glw method  @xcite , which uses @xmath29 decays to @xmath12-eigenstates ( e.g. , @xmath33 ) , the ads method  @xcite , where the @xmath6 or @xmath14 is reconstructed in a final state accessible to both cabibbo - favoured ( cf ) and doubly - cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs ) transitions ( e.g. , @xmath34 ) , and the ggsz method  @xcite , which exploits the interference over the dalitz plot of @xmath29 decays to three - body final states ( e.g. , @xmath35 ) .      as first step towards a measurement of @xmath10 with the glw method",
    ", the ratio of the @xmath30 branching fraction to that of @xmath31 is measured using the 2010 lhcb dataset , corresponding to 36.5 pb@xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the measurement is performed , simultaneously , for the cabibbo - favoured ( cf ) @xmath37 and the @xmath38 decay , and , separately , for the @xmath12-even @xmath39 ( cp+ ) decay ( a difference between the two can be expected due to the relative larger interference between the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 transitions in the @xmath12-even case ) .    the @xmath30 and @xmath31 signal yields are extracted with an unbinned extended maximum - likelihood fit to the @xmath21-mass distributions .",
    "the fit is performed simultaneously to four different mass distributions , which are obtained by separating the sample according to the charge of the bachelor hadron , and the value of a particle identification discriminant for the bachelor .",
    "the used pid discriminant is the difference of the log - likelihood between the kaon and pion hypotheses , dll@xmath40 .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : glw ] for the @xmath41 mode .",
    "the ratio of branching fractions is computed from the fitted yields and the ratio of efficiencies .",
    "the pid efficiency determination uses a data calibration sample of pions and kaons from @xmath42 decay and a re - weighting technique to take into account small difference in the kinematics between the calibration sample and the signal samples .",
    "other efficiencies ( geometric acceptance , trigger and reconstruction ) are very similar for the two decay modes , and their ratio is derived from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the results are : @xmath43 and @xmath44 from the ratio of the cp+ over cf measurements , the following @xmath10-sensitive observable is computed : @xmath45 in addition , three @xmath12 asymmetries are measured between the @xmath46 and the @xmath20 decay rates : @xmath47 none of the measured asymmetries significantly deviates from zero , but all results agree with existing measurements within their uncertainties .",
    "the main systematic uncertainties are associated to possible differences in the trigger response , to the pid calibration procedure , and to the parameterisation of the background . with larger data samples",
    ", we will be able to extract @xmath10 and all hadronic unknowns by combining @xmath48 and @xmath49 with measurements of additional @xmath10-sensitive observables from other methods .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 branching fractions is also measured in the @xmath50 final state , as it is the first step towards the measurement of @xmath10 with the ggsz method  @xcite . as for the glw analysis ,",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 samples are separated by the value of dll@xmath40 for the bachelor hadron .",
    "yields are extracted with a simultaneous fit to the @xmath21 invariant mass distributions for the two samples .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : ggsz ] . in 36.5 pb@xmath36 ,",
    "the fitted signal yield for @xmath31 is 95@xmath51 events , and the ratio of branching fraction of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is @xmath52 where the largest systematic uncertainty is due to the appropriateness of the fit model ( 7% ) .          the @xmath12 asymmetry in the decay rates of the suppressed ads mode @xmath53 is expected to be enhanced by the fact that the two interfering amplitudes in these modes have similar size .",
    "however , the branching fraction of this mode is small , @xmath54 , hence its observation is difficult .",
    "the most competitive result to date is from the belle collaboration  @xcite , who observed @xmath55 events ( @xmath56 significance ) in their full data set of @xmath57 @xmath58 pairs collected at the @xmath59 .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has performed a search for these modes using the early 2011 data - set , corresponding to 343 pb@xmath36 of data  @xcite .",
    "the analysis is similar to the glw analysis just described .",
    "an improved event selection , based on a `` boosted decision tree '' algorithm , is used in this case to isolate the @xmath60 candidates from the background . as for the previously described analyses ,",
    "the value of the particle identification variable dll@xmath40 for the @xmath21-meson bachelor track is used to effectively separate @xmath61 from @xmath62 .",
    "eight signal yields are extracted with an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit , corresponding to the two @xmath21-meson charges , the two product of kaon charges ( opposite - sign kaons are suppressed and same - sign kaons are favoured ) , and the two fail / pass slices according to the pid requirement on the bachelor , dll@xmath634 .",
    "particular attention has been paid to model the signal and the different background components in the fit .",

    "the main sources of systematic uncertainties are the pid calibration procedure and the background model .",
    "all these preliminary results are highly competitive with existing measurements and consistent with world averages .",
    "strange @xmath21 mesons offer a still largely unexplored window on @xmath12 violation studies and searches of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "for example , the determination of the absolute branching fraction for the rare decay @xmath69 provides an important constraint to different new physics models .",
    "the lhcb measurement of @xmath70  @xcite and of other @xmath18 decay branching fractions relies on the knowledge of @xmath23 , the ratio of @xmath18 production to @xmath3 production .",
    "we have performed two measurements of the ratio @xmath23 using the relative abundance of @xmath71 to @xmath72 , and to @xmath73 decays , and a measurement of the ratio @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the @xmath20 production fraction , using @xmath1 semileptonic decays , identified by the detection of a muon and a charmed hadron . in this section",
    ", we report on the hadronic  @xcite and semileptonic  @xcite measurements , and on their combination  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath76 decays is the first step towards the time - dependent analysis of @xmath77 , which is sensitive to @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the ratio of its branching fraction to u - spin related @xmath3 decay modes can be used to measure @xmath23  @xcite . here",
    ", we report on the latter measurement , which has been performed with a sample of 35 pb@xmath36 collected in 2010 .",
    "two normalisation modes are used : @xmath72 and @xmath78 .",
    "the first is dominated by contributions from colour - allowed tree - diagram amplitudes , and is therefore theoretically well - understood .",
    "the second leads to a smaller statistical uncertainty due to its greater yield , but suffers from an additional theoretical uncertainty due to the contribution from a @xmath79-exchange diagram .",

    "the semileptonic measurement of the @xmath11-hadron production fractions is based on 3 pb@xmath36 of lhcb data collected in 2010 .",

    "we do not attempt to separate @xmath75 and @xmath88 , but we measure their sum from @xmath6 and @xmath89 channels , taking into account corrections due to cross - feed from @xmath82 and @xmath4 decays .",
    "the @xmath1 signals are separated from various sources of background yields by studying the two - dimensional distributions of the charm candidate invariant mass and impact parameter ( ip ) with regard to the primary @xmath17 collision vertex .",

    "more details on this measurement can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      if we use isospin symmetry to set @xmath100 , the lhcb measurements of the ratio of strange @xmath21 meson to light neutral @xmath21 meson , obtained using @xmath1 semileptonic decays , is in good agreement with the two measurements obtained with hadronic decays . therefore , we combine them to derive @xmath101 since we do not observe a dependence upon properties such as the transverse momentum or rapidity of the @xmath21 meson , although our measurement is obtained from data within the lhcb acceptance , it is reasonable to assume that it is valid in other phase - space regions .",
    "we also note that , despite the fact that this ratio is not a - priori universal , our result is in remarkable agreement with the average between results from lep and tevatron experiments ( @xmath102  @xcite ) .",
    "the study of @xmath11-baryons is a largely unexplored area where lhcb has great potential for measurements of spectroscopy and @xmath12 violation . in particular , we look for @xmath103 , which is an unobserved @xmath4 decay mode .",
    "this channel is sensitive to the angle @xmath10  @xcite , similarly to @xmath104 , as originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it presents some advantages compared to @xmath105 , because the @xmath106 pair originates from the @xmath4 decay vertex , rather than from a long - lived intermediate particle , therefore a larger reconstruction efficiency is expected at lhcb . in addition , the use of the full phase - space of the three - body decay may enhance the sensitivity compared to the two - body process .",
    "the @xmath26 final state is studied together with the @xmath107 , and @xmath108 decays , which have similar kinematics and can be used as normalisation channels . with 333 pb@xmath36 taken by lhcb in early 2011",

    "lhcb is on track for a precise measurement of the ckm angle @xmath10 using @xmath11-hadron decays to open charm , with both well - established modes ( glw , ads , ggsz ) and unique ways ( e.g. , using @xmath116 , and @xmath117 decays ) . in particular ,",
    "the 4.0  @xmath111 evidence of the ads suppressed mode is highly competitive with the previous measurements .",
    "another important by - product of the study of @xmath11-hadron decays to open charm is the most precise measurement of @xmath23 , the @xmath18 production fraction with respect to that of @xmath118 , from the combination of lhcb results obtained with hadronic and semileptonic decays .",
    "all these results have been obtained with data samples from 2010 or early 2011 , which are just a fraction of the total expected by the end of this year ( 1 fb@xmath36 ) .",
    "hence , an improved precision in the measurement of @xmath10 and many other measurements with _ charming _ tree - level final states can be expected very soon from lhcb .",
