    "a more recent alternative to study the monopole content of gauge theories , without the need of addressing singular configurations , gauge fixing , nor introducing an extra higgs field , has been through calorons , which are instantons at finite temperature .",
    "it has been found that calorons are actually made up from constituent monopoles  @xcite , which becomes most apparent when the background polyakov loop is non - trivial ( as in the confined phase ) , and the size of the caloron is larger than the inverse temperature ( the extent of the euclidean time direction ) .",

    "charge 1 calorons have exactly one fermion zero - mode , which was shown for well separated constituents to be supported on one and only one constituent  @xcite .",
    "we may change the constituent that supports the zero - mode , by changing the fermion boundary conditions from ( anti)periodic , to being periodic up to a phase @xmath17 ( from now on we will use the classical scale invariance to set @xmath18 ) . for @xmath19 $ ]",
    "the zero - mode is localized to what we will call type @xmath20 constituent monopoles ( with mass @xmath21 , and the appropriate @xmath22 charge associated to their embedding in @xmath11 ) .",
    "lattice evidence has been gathered over recent years that these monopole constituents are present in dynamical configurations in the confined phase of gauge theories for @xmath0 using cooling  @xcite , and for @xmath23 using fermion zero - modes  @xcite as a filter .",
    "it is somewhat of a puzzle that these constituent monopoles had not been seen in earlier cooling studies ( apart from when using twisted boundary conditions  @xcite ) . that they remained unnoticed when",
    "using fermion zero - modes as a filter is , however , simply a consequence of the fact that these studies were restricted to the use of fixed fermion boundary conditions .",

    "[ fig : zmcycle ] we show a typical example based on the exact solutions for @xmath23 , closely following the observed behavior  @xcite based on actual lattice simulations in the confined phase , which guarantees the background polyakov loop to be non - trivial . in the high temperature phase , where the polyakov loop is trivial , two of the constituents are massless and only one peak will be seen .",

    "therefore , by studying these zero - modes in the general case , we hope to learn more about the localization of the monopoles .",
    "it is not directly obvious that any higher charge caloron can be described by point - like constituents in the far field limit .",
    "the tool to construct these solutions is the nahm equation  @xcite , which is a duality transformation that maps the problem of finding charge @xmath15 calorons to that of @xmath31 gauge fields on a circle with specific singularities at @xmath32 . in the cases studied so far , the dual ( nahm ) gauge field",

    "this is compensated by the singular behavior at the ellipse which forms the edge of the disk .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the singularity structure obtained in the high temperature limit will only tell us to which region the core will be restricted .",
    "we will need to resolve the non - abelian field components inside the core to understand how this limiting behavior comes about .",
    "we studied the zero - modes of higher charge calorons , in particular in the far field limit . in this limit",
    "one considers the regions outside the cores of the constituents monopoles , where the gauge field is abelian .",
    "the constituent monopoles are most prominent when they all have a non - zero mass , implying a non - trivial value of the holonomy .",
    "since the holonomy can be seen as a background polyakov loop , these calorons are therefore more relevant for the confined phase , where the average polyakov loop is non - trivial .",
    "lattice evidence for the relevance of these configurations is steadily increasing  @xcite , and much analytic understanding of the charge 1 calorons has been gained  @xcite .",
    "these reveal @xmath12 constituents for @xmath11 , which when well separated become static bps monopoles . to localize these monopoles",
    "it is useful to consider the high temperature limit , for which the masses go to infinity and the non - abelian cores shrink to zero size .",
    "we note that the high temperature limit is equivalent to the limit of infinite higgs vacuum expectation value ( recall that @xmath71 plays the role of the higgs field in the adjoint representation ) .",
    "since also chiral fermions in a caloron background generically have a mass , likewise going to infinity in the high temperature limit , one finds these zero - modes to be localized entirely to the non - abelian cores .",
    "indeed for charge 1 , the zero - mode density becomes a delta function at the location of one of the constituent monopoles .",
    "which one of them , is uniquely determined by the holonomy , and the phase up to which the zero - mode is chosen to be periodic in the imaginary time direction .",
    "we generalize away from anti - periodic boundary conditions since this freedom in choosing the phase allows us to control on which constituent the zero - mode localizes .",
    "it thus allows us to probe the underlying gauge field configuration , see fig .",
    "[ fig : zmcycle ] , as has been convincingly demonstrated in monte carlo studies as well  @xcite .    for higher charge @xmath11 calorons , @xmath444 , there will be @xmath16 constituent monopoles , or more precisely @xmath15 constituent monopoles of given type . within each type the magnetic charge associated to the embedding in @xmath22 , and the mass is fixed . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we constructed axially symmetric solutions , which shared many of the properties of the charge 1 solutions .",
    "in particular the high temperature limit gave point - like constituents and we have verified here that the zero - mode density indeed localizes to these constituents in the expected way , see fig .",
    "[ fig : zmlocal ] .",
    "this , however , is not expected to hold for higher charge calorons in general .",
    "the reason is that one constructs these solutions with the help of the nahm equation , described by a dual @xmath31 gauge field @xmath112 on the circle , with singularities at the eigenvalues @xmath133 of the logarithm of the holonomy . in case of the axially symmetric solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite this nahm gauge field is actually piecewize constant ( apart from some trivial @xmath31 gauge rotation ) , and its value on the interval @xmath105 $ ] directly determines the locations of the type @xmath113 monopole constituents .",
    "however , in general the nahm gauge field will not be piecewize constant . in that case",
    "it remained to be seen if the constituent locations are smeared out over all values of @xmath445 , or worse .    indeed in this paper",
    "we have found for charge 2 calorons in @xmath0 that in general the location of the constituents is smeared out over a disk . to be more precise ,",
    "we have shown that the zero - mode density vanishes everywhere , except on a disk that is bounded by an ellipse .",
    "we wish to stress that this result is found by solving the nahm equation on an interval , without imposing the boundary conditions .",
    "in other words , a disk is described by the parameters of the solution for each interval , that is for each monopole type , namely the center of mass , the orientation , a shape and a scale parameter ( eight in total ) .",
    "these should also be the building blocks for higher gauge groups @xmath11 since their dual descriptions differ only in the number of intervals .",
    "moreover , only the boundary conditions distinguish between calorons and monopole solutions , and we believe our result is of value in the context of the latter as well .    in particular we want to draw attention to the fact that ( the trace of ) the chiral fermion zero - mode density in the high temperature limit is the laplacian of a function @xmath446 that is determined in terms of the nahm gauge field and turns out to be a constant of the motion with respect to the nahm equation .",
    "we have verified this property by computing the multipole expansion of @xmath251 to a high order , but we expect this can be proven from the integrability of the nahm equations , an interesting problem to be pursued in the future . the fact that @xmath251 is conserved is a powerful result indeed , since it allowed us to calculate this function exactly , on which we base the findings mentioned above .",
    "this makes us conjecture that the cores of the constituent monopoles are in general extended , collapsing to the disk in the high temperature limit . in itself",
    "this is not surprising , since one knows from the study of monopoles , when two are closer together than the size of their core , they show an extended structure , for charge 2 indeed in the shape of a doughnut  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that we found , when approaching the disk from above with a test function smaller than the ring , the resulting zero - mode density can be negative .",
    "there are two reasons why we should not be too worried about this .",
    "if the core would collapse to points , the proper normalization of the zero - modes requires the contribution from the singularity to be quantized , giving a delta function of unit strength .",
    "when the core is extended , we have no such constraint . in addition , our equations are derived by ignoring the exponentially small terms that occur in the core . therefore our result is only valid outside the core , where we indeed find the zero - mode density to vanish .",
    "this means the cores have to lie within the disk , whereas the only thing we can say about their contributions is that they have to integrate to 2 ( since @xmath447 adds the two zero - mode densities ) .",
    "although this may seem to resemble a singularity like the dirac string , it is more subtle than that , because only like - charge monopoles are involved here .",
    "nevertheless , it does show that the non - abelian fields inside the core have an intricate behavior",
    ".    it will therefore be interesting in the future to try and get access to the gauge field and to see if the field strength shows further localization within the disks we have found on the basis of the zero - modes .",
    "another useful object is the polyakov loop because it traces the constituent monopoles  @xcite and is able to reveal extended structures in the context of abelian projection  @xcite .",
    "we believe to have gained sufficient information to get access to the solutions at finite temperature , with a fully resolved core to answer these questions , if necessary by numerical means",
    ".    however , from the physical point of view , the most important result of this paper is our demonstration that for well separated constituents , when the scale parameter @xmath273 is large , the shape of the caloron zero - mode density leads to point - like constituents , i.e. the shape parameter @xmath274 approaches 1 .",
    "it does so exponentially in @xmath273 and we have shown no structure is left on the disk bounded by the ellipse , collapsing to a line in this limit .",
    "any trace left over on this line is proportional to @xmath448 , and therefore vanishes exponentially in @xmath273 .",
    "this comes about through the boundary conditions @xmath445 has to satisfy at the  impurities \" @xmath133 , relating the size and shape parameters , @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",
    "we leave it to a future publication to more fully describe the moduli space of solutions , solving for these constraints . also here",
    "some remarkable simplifications seem to occur , related to the integrability of the nahm equations .",
    "the results of this paper therefore provide one further step in establishing that non - abelian gauge field configurations can be described on a large distance scale in terms of abelian monopoles .",
    "of course it is only a small step , because we use exact self - dual solutions to establish these results .",
    "this has been in part because we discovered earlier  @xcite , somewhat to our surprise , that it is far from trivial to write down superpositions of these monopole fields without having visible dirac strings all over the place , that would carry too much energy for comfort . in part",
    "this is due to the crudeness involved in the superposition , instead requiring a fine - tuning of the non - abelian tails with the exponential components in the abelian gauge field ( to properly absorb the return flux ) .",
    "it has been this problem to deal with dirac strings that for so long has hampered attempts to describe an interacting theory of magnetic monopoles  @xcite .    in the light of this",
    "it would of course be welcome if more lattice studies are performed to get a handle on the dynamics of these constituent monopoles .",
    "it should be pointed out that instantons larger than @xmath449 will no longer reveal themselves as lumps of size @xmath358 .",
    "rather there is a transition region beyond which @xmath358 should be interpreted to set the inter - constituent distance ( typically of order @xmath450 ) , whereas the size of the lumps is in this region set by the mass of the constituent monopoles .",
    "this may lead to a natural infrared cutoff in the size distribution of instantons , provided by the temperature ( rather than the spatial volume ) .",
    "because of this it may be worthwhile to reinvestigate the issue of the instanton size distribution , also with the criticism presented in ref .",
