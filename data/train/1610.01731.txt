    "after calibration , known rfi signals were excised , followed by a filtering process that removed frequency channels in which the off - pulse variation in a 20-channel wide frequency window was four times greater than the median variation value . throughout the data reduction process",

    "psr  j1909@xmath1243744 is one of the best - timed pulsars known .",
    "it shows the lowest aen upper limit for all pulsars and was observed for the entire @xmath29  year timespan .",
    "it is the pulsar with the second - ranked total wn in ng9wn , behind psr  b1937 + 21 , which is further confirmed in figure  [ fig : acwsummary ] . due to the lack of aen ,",
    "the pulsar is the most intrinsically stable clock in the nanograv pulsar timing array .",
    "if the cen can be mitigated in the future , it may become the overall most stable clock in our pulsar timing array .      as with several other pulsars , we see strong peaks in the log - variance likelihoods for both aen and cen ( and a detection in the single - process excess ) .",
    "the @xmath115 measurement from ng9wn is an upper limit , which means that our method causes excess noise to be absorbed by the wn .",
    "the large value of @xmath26 measured in the 820  mhz band implies that even after @xmath379  years of timing , achieving a large pulse @xmath107 to measure pulse jitter may be difficult .",
    "timing residuals for psr  b1937 + 21 show the most obvious signature of red noise due to the fact that the aen , the vast majority of which is red from the sf analysis , dominates over the wn .",
    "this pulsar is the only one in the pulsar timing array where the aen dominates .",
    "sources of the achromatic red noise have been attributed to a variety of causes , including : neutron star rotational irregularities ( sc2010 ) , spin perturbations from an orbiting asteroid belt @xcite , and gws .",
    "the chromatic component is thought to be due to interstellar propagation effects @xcite , such as dm and scattering variations @xcite .",
    "@xcite found evidence for both achromatic and chromatic noise components in the international pulsar timing array data release 1 .",
    "while the ism has been suggested as a source of red noise , we find no evidence for any leakage of chromatic noise into the residuals for psr  b1937 + 21 at the @xmath270  ns level ( 95% upper limit ) over 9.1  years of timing .",
    "however , our timing model includes a large number of @xmath108 bins spanning that time and the most @xmath18 parameters ( 5 ) of any pulsar s model in our data set which can absorb cen components .    as with psr  j1713",
    "+ 0747 , we analyzed the residuals from each telescope independently and find that the excess noise at ao ( from 2513 analyzed toas ) is also slightly lower than that at the gbt ( from 7217 analyzed toas ) . from our sf analysis , we see that the majority of the excess noise for psr  b1937 + 21 is red .",
    "it is unclear if the contributing red processes are common to the pulsar and/or the line of sight path , however the large majority of the variance should be from observatory - independent causes .",
    "since both sets of residuals from each telescope derive from one global timing model fit , it is unclear how each telescope contributes to the timing model parameter estimation and therefore the post - fit excess noise as well .",
    "psr  j2010@xmath1241323 shows a strong peak in the log - variance likelihoods of aen though it does not meet our cutoff for detection , which is also likely biased from the upper limit on wn .",
    "we compute an upper limit in cen .",
    "the pulsar weakly scintillates and therefore it will be difficult to constrain @xmath115 , especially at the 820  mhz receiver band where the number of scintles observed is large .      psr  j2017 + 0603 was observed in three different receiver bands in ng9 and shows upper limits in both red noise components .",
    "the wn parameters at 430  mhz and 1400  mhz are not well - constrained though less than 2  years of data have been collected .",
    "the pulsar strongly scintillates at 1400  mhz and therefore a measurement of @xmath115 should be possible in the near future . at 430  mhz ,",
    "the number of scintles is large , and coupled with the low pulse @xmath107 , estimating jitter will be difficult .",
    "data from the 430  mhz receiver were collected for only about one third of the observing timespan and is currently no longer observed using the receiver .",
    "therefore , refining the noise model for the receiver band is not a priority and the data may be excluded from future timing analyses .",
    "psr  j2317 + 1439 contains the only 327  mhz data in ng9 .",
    "the pulsar was observed with both 327  mhz and 430  mhz for the majority of its total timespan until the last two years when 1400  mhz observations were added .",
    "we detect aen in the timing residuals of the pulsar , and since the white noise parameters were well - determined for all three bands , we believe the measurement to be accurate .",
    "we excluded these pulsars from our analyses because all pulses in at least one receiver band did not meet the @xmath380 requirement for inclusion in the ng9wn analysis ( note that the time and frequency resolutions were not the same as in this work ) .",
    "therefore , the wn model is undetermined for the pulsars in those specific receiver bands and we are unable to adjust the errors on the toas accordingly .",
    "we removed timing residuals between mjds 55750 and 56020 corresponding to an instrumental error with 430  mhz data taken by the asp receiver for these three pulsars only .",
    "psr  b1953 + 29 still shows chromatic excess noise though the timespan over which dual frequency data remain is only @xmath21  year as compared to the total 7.2  years observed ; the largely red noise may then be in part to poor dm estimation .",
    "similarly , only @xmath21  year of dual frequency data remain for psr  j1741 + 1351 , resulting however in an upper limit on cen .",
    "psr  j1923 + 2515 is the pulsar observed for the shortest timespan ( 1.6  years ) that shows a detection of aen .",
    "psrs  j1910 + 1256 and j1944 + 0907 show detections of strongly red aen but have long spans of early single - frequency - band ( 1400  mhz ) coverage with a much smaller frequency range using the asp backend ( for psr  j1944 + 0907 , 430  mhz data are present for the first epoch only ) .",
    "a single dm was fit over a significant fraction of the total timespan : 1650 days for psr  j1910 + 1256 , 1250 days for psr  j1944 + 0907 .",
    "we therefore expect errors in the timing residuals from the time - varying dm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a chromatic effect .",
    "however , because the asp bandwidth is so small , our method can not separate chromatic noise from achromatic noise .",
    "some large portion of the measured aen is then actually cen from unmodeled dm variations . without legacy data from those time periods , those data may need to be removed from the data set for robust gw detection .      like psrs  j1643@xmath1241224 and j1903 + 0327",
    ", these two pulsars ( psr  j1640 + 2224 at 430  mhz and psr  j1600@xmath1243053 at 820  mhz ) showed a disagreement between the upper limits on @xmath382 and the scintillation - estimated @xmath66 .",
    "we repeat the same procedure for adjusting the wn parameters and both show significant chromatic red noise .",
    "these pulsars show detections of aen and upper limits of cen , four of which show strongly red residual : psrs  j0030 + 0451 , j0613@xmath1240200 , b1855 + 09 , and j2145@xmath1240750 ) , with j1744@xmath1241134 showing a significant detection of red noise .",

    "the large number of scintles @xmath26 implies that lack of strong scintillation events may make refinement of the wn parameters , specifically @xmath115 , difficult in the future given the large quantity of data already available for the pulsar .",

    "it is therefore unsurprising that the noise parameters are ill - constrained for these pulsars .",
    "the other three pulsars were observed for between 4 and 6 years but show no hints of excess noise .",
    "the wn parameters for the pulsars are not well - constrained in at least one of the receiver bands and therefore the conservative errors may be absorbing some of the excess noise .",
    "even so , it is possible that some subset of the pulsars may turn out to be stable clocks on longer timescales .",
    "a large value of @xmath26 was observed for psr  j1614@xmath1242230 in ng9wn , and therefore it may be difficult to estimate @xmath115 for the 820  mhz band . on the reverse side , psr  j1738 + 0333 strongly scintillates and therefore @xmath115 may be estimated at 2300  mhz in the near future . psr  j1853 + 1303 shows strong scintillation at 1400  mhz but weaker potential for scintillation events at 430  mhz .",
