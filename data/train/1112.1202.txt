    "photosynthetic pigment - protein complexes arranged as light - harvesting antenna absorb the sun light and transfer the captured energy towards the photosynthetic reaction center , where electron transfer across the membrane is initiated . in addition",
    "light harvesting antennae also carry out self - regulation function , which is a physiologically highly significant strategy evolved by plants @xcite .",
    "thanks to the excitation energy density control in photosystem ii , termed non - photochemical quenching ( npq ) , plant photosynthesis can function efficiently under very different light conditions , from low up to very high intensities corresponding to daily changes of illumination at the same location .",
    "the npq phenomenon is usually attributed to some activated quenching species which allow the excitation to undergo a rapid non - radiative decay .",
    "the exact location of the quencher within the antenna and its precise nature are a matter of on - going debate , with both chlorophylls ( chl ) and carotenoids ( car ) being put forward as essential components of the quenching mechanism .",
    "the promising candidates for the quenching mechanisms ( in no order of preference ) are : ( i ) quenching by a chlchl dimer showing the charge transfer ( ct ) state character @xcite or via the formation of chlchl excimeric states @xcite ; ( ii ) by a ct state between chl and car ( xanthophyll ) resulting in generation of the cation radical state of the xanthophyll @xcite ; ( iii ) via the excitonic coupling of chl to a short - lived xanthophyll excited state @xcite , and ( iv ) by the direct energy transfer from the chl pool to a particular car ( lutein ) @xcite .",
    "both latter suggestions are based on the fact that the lifetime of the lowest excited state of the lutein molecule is short ( < 10 ps ) .",
    "evidently , this could explain the possible quenching efficiency in the light - harvesting complex of photosystem ii ( lhcii ) if a specific arrangement between the chl and car molecules is established under the npq conditions .",
    "thus , according to the latter suggestions , the simplest candidate which might be responsible for the npq , is an asymmetric molecular dimer ( a heterodimer ) .",
    "the possibility to attribute the excitation quenching ability to the chlcar heterodimer was also suggested and experimentally studied for model dyads composed of car and tetrappyroles @xcite .",
    "a dimer is also the simplest molecular aggregate where the excitonic features are well expressed .",
    "spectral characteristics of molecular dimers are often remarkably different from those of the individual molecules .",
    "their absorption bands can be significantly shifted in comparison with those of their constituent molecules , mainly due to intermolecular interactions resulting in a nonlocal character of their excited eigenstates .",
    "these delocalized eigenstates of electronic excitations are usually termed molecular excitons @xcite .",
    "the interaction of electronic excitations with intra- and inter - molecular vibrations causes a disruption of the phase relationship between excited states of the molecules constituting the exciton wave functions @xcite .",
    "such type of interaction makes a distinct influence on the exciton dynamics , and plays the dominant role in determining the exciton relaxation pathways .",
    "usually , a homodimer is used for considering various aspects of the exciton dynamics and relaxation @xcite . for a heterodimer",
    ", the distinctness of constituent monomers is often limited to excitation energies @xcite .",
    "some aspects which could be attributed to the heterodimer were also disclosed by analyzing the excitonct state mixing problems @xcite .",
    "recent experiments based on coherent photon echo measurements demonstrated the possibility to follow the coherent phase dynamics and incoherent population relaxation of excitons in photosynthetic pigment - protein complexes @xcite . however , possible role of the coherent dynamics in determining such type of the regulation function attributing it to the ability of the excitation quenching in heterodimers has not been considered yet . here , such type of the analysis is presented .",
    "we consider the effects originated from the differences in the excitation energies , reorganization energies and excitation lifetimes of the constituent molecules of the heterodimer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sub : excitonic - dimer ]",
    "we introduce a theoretical model of an excitonic dimer and discuss the general form of equations describing the excitation dynamics in the system . in sections [ sub : redfield - relaxation - scheme ] and",
    "[ sub : heom - relaxation - scheme ] we introduce two specific theories of relaxation that are nowadays standard in the literature and in section [ sub : exciton - decay ] we discuss our model for the radiationless excitation energy dissipation .",
    "numerical results for the excited state dynamics under various parameters of the dimer system with and without relaxation to the ground state are presented in sections [ sub : population - kinetics ] and [ sub : relaxation - to - the ] , respectively .",
    "the consequences of these results and the possible role of the heterodimer in determining the npq are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the exciton spectra of molecular aggregates are usually considered in the so - called heitler - london approximation @xcite . according to this theoretical concept ,",
    "monomers comprising the dimer are characterized by two electronic levels , which reflect the resonant transition in the spectral region under consideration .",
    "the states of the dimer can be constructed on a hilbert space , which is a direct product of the hilbert spaces of the monomers .",
    "the ground state of the dimer is constructed from monomers @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , two singly - excited states are defined as @xmath3 , @xmath4 where the _ _",
    "i__th molecule is in the excited state and the _ _ j__th molecule in the ground state .",
    "the two singly - excited states are coupled to each other by the resonance interaction @xmath5 , and consequently they are not eigenstates of the system .",
    "a double - excited state @xmath6 where both molecules are excited is not relevant in our analysis .",
    "the given states form the site basis .",

    "usually it is assumed that the initial full density operator @xmath47 can be factorized into the rdo , @xmath48 , and the complementary equilibrium density operator of the bath : @xmath49 .",

    "the redfield equations can already be used in calculations , however , under the conditions justifying the markov approximation the related electronic dynamics is much slower then the decay of the bath correlation and the scheme can be simplified by shifting the integration limit in eq . to @xmath74 .",

    "then we derive the rates @xmath166 and @xmath167 from the known value of @xmath164 and the detailed balance condition .",
    "it is noteworthy that one must use an effective energy gap instead of the purely excitonic one if the reorganization energies are large .",
    "finally , we calculate @xmath155 and @xmath156 from the relaxation superoperator @xmath101 in the preferred basis , and then construct the @xmath168 eigenvalue .",
    "the results obtained are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : solutions - of - hqme+r ] using the logarithmic scale .",
    "the populations of the long - lived state ( in black ) are shown together with their analytical approximations ( in green ) . in the case of @xmath169 (",
    "dashed curves ) the lower state is the long - lived one ( hence , originating from the bright electronic state ) , therefore the thermalization part gives a minor effect .",
    "as can be seen , the actual rate of the relaxation to the ground state , @xmath170 , depends on which of the two states the short - lived or the long - lived is the lower one in the dimer .    ]",
    "the analysis given above provides an explanation of the long - time decay rate ( @xmath168 ) sensitivity to the position of the short - living state .",
    "in particular , swapping the states results in swapping the values of @xmath155 and @xmath156 in eqs . .",
    "therefore , the second term in the first equation from eq . changes the sign , and that is the reason why the overall decay rate is sensitive to which state the fast decaying or the slowly decaying - is the lower one .",
    "as follows from our calculations , the asymmetry in reorganization energies allows for two non - equivalent definitions of the energy gap in the one - exciton manifold .",
    "these two cases clearly have different physical meanings . since the energy @xmath171 refers to the franck - condon transition region of the potential energy surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : definition of gap ] ) , @xmath134 corresponds to the distance between the peak positions in the absorption spectra .",
    "therefore we can loosely call it the optical energy difference .",
    "this has a perfectly clear meaning in the absorption spectroscopy , however , the thermal equilibrium does not establish itself with respect to this energy gap .",
    "should the resonance coupling be simply perturbative , we could expect the thermalization with respect to @xmath133 as the first approximation .",
    "since this gap is usually used in the frster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) theory @xcite we shall call it the frster energy difference .    for the fixed optical energy difference , in the case of @xmath172 an equal amount of energy associated with each state",
    "is dissipated during the thermalization , and therefore the same equilibrium values are reached . in the case of @xmath123 ,",
    "the vibrational relaxation shifts the initial energies by a different amount ( @xmath127 ) . hence , according to the redfield relaxation , in fig . [ fig : main evolutions]a the energy gap between the states is effectively decreased ( green curve ) or increased ( red curve ) ( here , the increase of the energy gap is seemingly the reason for the failure of the redfield scheme ) .",
    "the case of fixed frster energy gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : main evolutions]b ) demonstrates the excitonic mixing of reorganization energies even better in the sense that for uncoupled monomers the vibrational relaxation would yield identical @xmath133 regardless of the combination of @xmath132 s .",
    "the actual situation is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : different forster gaps ] .",
    "an interesting situation arises in the case of @xmath173 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : main evolutions]b , red curve ) , because the two states are swapped in comparison with the other combinations ( both initially and in the long - time limit ) .",
    "the way all the equilibrium values are ordered ( which corresponds to the width of the energy gap that determines the equilibration ) tells us the peculiarity of the redfield scheme , namely , that the reorganization energies are mixed according to the initial , i.e. optical energy gap ( cf .",
    "hence , the initial excitonic configuration is maintained throughout the whole evolution .",
    "this is even more strongly pronounced in the secular redfield scheme ( fig .",
    "[ fig : main evolutions]e and f ) where the equilibration is fully determined by the optical energy gap @xmath134 alone .",
    "this shows us how severely the neglect of the interplay between the populations and coherences can distort the picture of thermalization .",
    "for instance , it would suggest that dimers with identical absorption maxima positions but different line - widths would have identical equilibrium population distributions .",
    "the full redfield equations , on the contrary , demonstrate that the optical energy gap , as the most intuitive input parameter , along with the resonance coupling are not enough for the description of thermal equilibrium in the case of different reorganization energies .",
    "moreover , even the frster energy gap can be a poor benchmark for assessing the equilibrium populations ( cf .",
    "[ fig : different forster gaps ] bottom panel ) .     are shown on the left .",
    "the dotted arrows on the right represent the vibrational relaxation ( and tilde is used to denote the excitonic basis ) .",
    "the top row corresponds to @xmath172 , the middle and the bottom ones - to @xmath174 and @xmath173 accordingly .",
    "[ fig : different forster gaps ] ]    the hqme solutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : main evolutions]c and d ) bear some resemblance to the results that follow from the redfield equations .",
    "however , an unexpected feature is the difference between equilibrium population values for the case when @xmath172 , which again tells us about different energy gaps in each case .",
    "this points to the action of the bath upon the system .",
    "and indeed we find that the conventional excitonic basis is just an approximate eigenbasis due to the non - vanishing coherences . establishing the preferred basis as given previously led us to conclude that a good measure of the action of the bath is an effective resonance coupling @xmath175 , which has been used to replace the original @xmath176 value with to reproduce the effective energy gap defined by the thermal equilibrium in the eigenbasis .",
    "it appears ( cf .",
    "[ fig : polaron basis ] ) that the connection between the original resonance coupling and the effective one resembles the so - called small polaron transformation @xcite .",
    "the details of such dynamic suppression of the resonance coupling captured by the hqme is beyond the scope of this paper and are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "discussing the relaxation to the ground state requires a couple of remarks about the excitonic mixing of lifetimes . from eqs .",
    "or we notice that the mixing of lifetimes does not depend on which of the two states is the lower one . in the special case of one state",
    "being extremely long - lived , we can obtain the following picture : for a dimer degenerate in energies both excitonic states would have lifetimes twice the lifetime of the short - lived state in the site representation , whereas for different site energies in the limit of negligible coupling @xmath176 we retrieve the original values of the lifetimes .",
    "now , the intermediate regime ( energy gap not too big and/or rather strong resonance coupling ) tells us that the shorter lifetime varies rather moderately , but the longer one can acquire a huge range of values depending on the actual arrangement of the system as demonstrated in fig . [ fig : mixing - of - lifetimes ] .",
    "the full picture of the excitation dissipation depends essentially on the interplay between the relaxation to the ground state and the thermalization driven by the system - bath interaction .",
    "the total process , which is a two - exponential decay , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all 4 relaxations hqme ] . the exponents can be attributed to the thermalization and relaxation to the ground state ( cf .",
    "eq . ) . in the long - time limit , both the lower and the higher state populations decay with the same rate ( the latter not shown here ) because the equilibration is much faster than the relaxation . therefore , the systems relaxes while being in a dynamic equilibrium .",
    "the reorganization energies partly determine the rates of the initial step of evolution and the amplitudes of the long - time decay .",
    "the long - time rates are identical for all four combinations of @xmath132 s ( as seen from the parallel slopes in the figure ) .",
    "these dependencies are qualitatively similar to those of the evolutions without relaxation to the ground state .",
    "upon comparison of the numerical results with analytical expressions , it can be seen that the faster relaxation rate largely determines the rate of the whole process , and therefore the lifetime of the short - lived excitonic state is the determining factor of the excitation relaxation to the ground state . moreover , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : solutions - of - hqme+r ] and as follows from eqs . , in the presence of the system - bath interaction the decay rates are different depending on which of the two states is the lower one ( cf . the case of purely excitonic mixing of lifetimes ) .",
    "the decay is faster if the short - lived state is below the long - lived one , however , for the parameters used , the difference is just of a few picoseconds .",
    "the parameters of the heterodimer chosen for calculations are similar to those of the chlcar dimer , which is assumed to be responsible for the additional quenching of the excitation under the npq conditions @xcite .",
    "indeed , the excitation lifetime of the @xmath177 state of carotenoids is short ( less than @xmath178 ) and the optical transition from the ground state to the @xmath177 state is forbidden , hence the excitation and reorganization energies in this case are not directly observable .",
    "however , the reorganization energy is a decisive parameter of the system - bath coupling , therefore , we have to consider the possible influence of the reorganization energy of the car molecule on the excitation relaxation in such a heterodimer .",
    "it might be expected , that the excitation energy of the car molecule in a specific chlcar dimer should be slightly above the excitation energy of the chl molecule under unquenched conditions , and tends to be lower under the npq ones @xcite .",
    "this statement can be examined using our model considerations , which demonstrate that it is only partially valid .",
    "the short lifetime component is the dominant control parameter of the excitation lifetime in such a dimer independently of the relative positioning of the molecular excitations of the monomers . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : solutions - of - hqme+r ] the excitation decays with the characteristic lifetime of @xmath179 if the optically allowed excited state of the chl molecule is higher than the optically forbidden excited state of car .",
    "it decays with the lifetime of @xmath180 in the opposite case .",
    "fast ( of the order of @xmath181 ) relaxation of the excitation from the initially excited state of the chl molecule to the excited state of car taking place in the former case determines the main difference between both situations .",
    "thus , the difference in the quenching efficiency between these two cases are related to the difference in the rates of excitation transfer back to the chlorophylls of the surrounding antenna . moreover ,",
    "the dominant effect of the quenching ability of such heterodimer is determined not by the excitonic effects ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mixing - of - lifetimes ] ) , but rather by the exciton - bath interaction . as can be concluded from eqs . , the molecule characterized by the shortest relaxation time forms the valve of the excitation relaxation and defines the excitation lifetime within the heterodimer .",
    "the same model of heterodimer is also applicable to excitonct state coupling conditions @xcite .",
    "since the lifetimes of both states are long and comparable , the dynamics within such a dimer corresponds to the limit of @xmath128 .",
    "the quenching ability of this dimer is determined solely by the thermalization within the excitonic states .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : main evolutions]b ( or d ) demonstrates that , under certain configuration of reorganization energies , the ct state can be the higher one ( red curve ) even though it should be the lower one to ensure the quenching ability in the frster limit .",
    "we have considered dynamics within a heterogeneous system of two interacting molecules .",
    "the main sources of heterogeneity in this system are the difference in excitation energies , asymmetry in reorganization energies ( spectral line - widths ) and the different excited state lifetimes of the chromophores .",
    "we point out that difference of reorganization energies introduces an ambiguity in the concept of energy gap between the excited states .",
    "this situation is particularly important when considering differences between coherent and incoherent transfer , since upon excitonic mixing under certain combinations of reorganization energies , the two states can become energetically swapped with respect to the uncoupled ones . furthermore , employing the hqme technique revealed that the conventional excitonic basis becomes renormalized under the action of the bath .    the analytical study of excitonic mixing of the excited state lifetimes and the estimates following from it revealed that the lifetime of the long - living state can be indeed greatly reduced .",
    "however , we found that the final picture of energy dissipation from the system crucially depends on the system - bath interaction rather than just on the excitonic coupling .",
    "namely , the short - living state , irrespectively of its energetic position , forms the valve of the process and largely determines the rate of dissipation by setting its lower boundary .",
    "we conclude that in the case of the chlcar dimer the rate of excitation relaxation is of the similar order as the inverse lifetime of car @xmath177 state even if the state is above the chl excited state .",
    "this has direct consequences in assessing the model of chlcar dimer as a quenching center of the npq process .",
