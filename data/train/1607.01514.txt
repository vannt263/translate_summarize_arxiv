    "identification of an intriguing collective dynamical state , namely the chimera state , in an ensemble of coupled identical nonlinear oscillators with nonlocal coupling  @xcite has initiated intense research activities in the recent literature  @xcite .",

    "it is to be noted that the term coherent / incoherent domains here represents the homogenous / inhomogenous nature of the dynamics of the attractors in the corresponding domain and does not refer to the nature of the attractors , that is whether they are coherent attractors with a fixed center of rotation or incoherent attractors with more than one center of rotation .",

    "it is a dynamically active emerging behavior in contrast to the chimera death  @xcite , where nearby oscillators populate the same branch of the inhomogeneous steady state in the coherent domain while the nearby oscillators populate different branches of the inhomogeneous steady state in the incoherent domain .",

    "we have also confirmed the emergence of phase - flip chimera from the ensemble for the periodic oscillations of the individual rssler oscillators with the global coupling between the agents .",

    "however , we would like to point out that once the spatial ordering of the globally coupled oscillators are fixed by indexing them from @xmath127 to @xmath7 , then the distribution of initial conditions as stated above among the oscillators results in spatially inhomogeneous states with coherent out - of - phase synchronized domains interspersed by incoherent domain comprised of nearby oscillators exhibiting in - phase and anti - phase oscillations .",

    "in summary , we have identified an interesting type of a collective dynamical regime , called phase - flip chimeras , in an ensemble of identical rssler oscillators coupled indirectly via the agents from a common dynamic environment , where the agents are coupled nonlocally with a coupling radius @xmath23 .",
    "such interactions are found in the diffusion of biomolecues between the cells and their environment  @xcite .",

    "the robustness of the phase - flip chimera is also confirmed by depicting its occurrence in a wide range of parameters using the two - parameter phase diagram .",
    "further , it is also shown that the phase - flip chimera is preceded by the conventional chimera and it emerges only after the completely synchronized state emerges . in the chaotic regime the phase - flip chimera is immediately preceded by asynchronous state , which in turn emerges as a desynchronized state from the synchronous evolution of the ensemble of oscillators .",
    "we have used the strength of incoherence , probability distribution of the correlation coeffecient and the master stability function to characterize the observed dynamical transition of the ensemble of the rssler oscillators .",
