    "an idea to use an additional variable for account of internal microstructure changes in polyatomic gases was proposed by herzfeld and rice in 1928 @xcite .",
    "this idea has got development in other numerous researches of that time @xcite . in 1937",
    "landau applied it to describe phase transitions in solids @xcite . in the post - war years",
    "landau in cooperation with khalatnikov and ginzburg for description of phase transitions offered some kinetic equations , describing the evolution of order parameter @xcite . in modern science this direction is presented by the theory of the phase fields @xcite . unlike the theory of landau the parameter of order in the theory of the phase fields is not so strict , however , this does not hinder in getting results which rather well coincide with the behavior of the real systems .    to complete the picture , note that another direction in the description of such phenomena was offered in 1967 by coleman and gurtin , who complemented the primary idea by the elements of rational mechanics @xcite .",
    "this direction was continued in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite an additional variable (  order parameter  ) , meaning the scalar density of embryonic microcracks , was introduced to describe the initial stage of destruction of a quasi - brittle solid . later in the work by peter van @xcite the application of internal state variables",
    "approach to the problem of destruction of cracking materials was examined . for the description of crackness level an additional vector variable @xmath0",
    "is introduced , which is related to thermodynamic conjugated variable @xmath1 .    between both approaches",
    "there is no an impenetrable border , they use one and the same fundamental idea .",
    "the difference is that the internal state variables approach one comes from the principles and postulates of mechanics of continuous media , while the approach by landau is based on more general energetic principles , which , however , need further development .",
    "interest which is sometimes shown in comparison of these two approaches is therefore clear @xcite .    a further approach of mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics is currently developed for investigation of soft - matter problem with mesoscopic structural elements @xcite .",
    "the method addresses the system s entropy production , which is a detectable quantity at the mesoscopic level of condensed - matter organization ; it also reveals effectively the kinetic - thermodynamics properties and peculiarities of the corresponding dynamic matter arrangements .",
    "the present article is devoted to the development of the landau approach , which in the present version appears under the name of non - equilibrium evolutional thermodynamics ( neet ) . in part ii ,",
    "the basic postulates of neet are given , which are grounded by the results attained currently . in part",
    "iii the approach is applied to the description of defect kinetics during metal treatment by severe plastic deformation ( spd ) . in part",
    "iv summarizing conclusions are given .",
    "the first important difference of neet from the classic scheme treating the problem is the introduction of the set of non - equilibrium thermodynamics potentials @xcite . up to the present ,",
    "basic , if not unique , stress was laid on the use of the free energy .",
    "the free energy is still a major function , which in energetic expression and logarithmic scale is a value inverse to the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the system states @xcite .",
    "a postulate is well known in statistical physics that the most probable states near a maximum of pdf , that is , automatically , near a minimum of the free energy @xcite are realized only .    in this context",
    "the use of the free energy is very comfortable , because the most probability ( stationary ) state can be found from the universal principle of a minimum of the free energy . at the same time , in structural physics not for all of the physical systems the pdf is certain , and , consequently , the free energy on its basis .",
    "mainly , one uses a phenomenological generalization of the free energy , when the application of principle of minimum is not grounded statistically .",
    "applicability of this principle is well proven most strictly for solids with vacancies , at the same time , for solids with other types of defects ( dislocations , grain boundaries etc ) pdf is unknown , and , consequently , applicability of this principle is not grounded strictly . therefore a solid with vacancies can be a good model for approbation of ideas , having general character @xcite .",
    "if the equilibrium ( stationary ) state of the system is known , in the case of small deviation of the system from that states , the evolution ( relaxation ) of the system can be written down as a condition that the system tends to the equilibrium state with a speed the greater the stronger the deviation . in terms of the free energy this condition results in the well known landau - khalatnikov evolution equation @xcite or in the case of the distributed systems in the ginzburg - landau equation @xcite . at the same time , there is no obstacle to write down the evolution of the system in terms of other thermodynamic potentials , for example , in terms of the internal energy .",
    "the internal energy is the clearest physically determined energy of the system ; it is basic in both thermodynamics and physics in general .",
    "this energy is included in formulation of the first law of thermodynamics ; it is universal for both the equilibrium and non - equilibrium states .",
    "in addition , the generalized thermodynamic force is determined through it not phenomenologically , as , for example , for the free energy , but fully strictly within the framework of statistical consideration .",
    "indeed , pdf for a solid with vacancies looks like @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 where @xmath3 is a normalizing constant , @xmath4 is the thermodynamic probability , @xmath5 is the internal energy , @xmath6 is the number of atoms in a solid , @xmath7 is the number of vacancies , @xmath8 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath9 is a temperature .",
    "a pre - exponential multiplier describes combinational , that is entropic , part of the distribution function , related to degeneration of macrostates .",
    "the exponent describes a restrictive part of the distribution function , related to overcoming the potential barriers between microstates .",
    "the most probable state is determined by a condition @xmath10 , from where , in accordance with ( 1 ) , most naturally appears a variable @xmath11 it has a sense of the average energy of a defect ( here a vacancy ) , or of the chemical potential of defects , on the other side , eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) is a typical determination of the generalized thermodynamic force .",
    "here it is not , however , postulated , but logically follows from eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) , as a part of the process of determination of the equilibrium state , and , consequently , it must enter relaxation equation , as the equation describing system tendency to the equilibrium state .",
    "now the evolutional equation in terms of the internal energy can be written down as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a kinetic coefficient , @xmath14 is a value of the vacancy energy in the equilibrium state .    to define the equilibrium value of the vacancy energy and the equilibrium density of vacancies , we all the same must address the condition of a maximum of pdf or a minimum of the free energy , and , it would seem , it is simpler to describe relaxation in terms of the free energy , immediately using the landau - khalatnikov equation .",
    "however , eq . ( [ b3 ] ) is also true , and can also be used .",
    "especially it can be valuable at generalizations to other types of defects , for which phenomenological generalization of the free energy is problematic , and at times speculative , whereas the internal energy is of the universal nature .",
    "the substantial difference of treating the problem in terms of the internal energy is that the generalized force ( [ b2 ] ) is not equal to zero in the equilibrium state , and , consequently , for the internal energy the extreme principle does not work .",
    "this  pitfall  can be compensated as the generalized force ( [ b2 ] ) is determined uniformly for both the equilibrium and non - equilibrium states , if the equilibrium energy of the defect is known for us from some sources for the defined values of external control parameters , then it is possible to find its value for other parameters easily .",
    "this advantage is for the first time exposed in the present article .",
    "the second postulate , which distinguishes this approach from traditional one , is the use of the density of defects as an independent thermodynamic variable instead of the configuration entropy .",
    "note that this variable is used not in parallel with the configuration entropy , but instead of it .",
    "mutually identical dependence between the density of defects and the configuration entropy can serve as a foundation for this purpose . in the case of a solid with vacancies this one - to - one dependence follows from the fundamental boltzmann relationship @xmath15 and from definition of @xmath4 in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) . for other types of defects",
    "this relation is unknown , but it still must be mutually identical .",
    "it allows to generalize the 1st law of thermodynamics in the form @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the volume of the system , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are stress and elastic deformations tensors , @xmath20 is thermal or , for a solid , oscillation ( not configuration ) entropy , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are non - equilibrium temperature and entropy , which characterize the dynamic transitional phenomena during the generation and motion of the structural defects @xcite , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are energy and density of @xmath25-kind defects , @xmath26 is the number of types of the defects .",
    "thus the internal energy is a function of such independent variables as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath22 and @xmath24 , that is , @xmath27 .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) are changes in the internal energy due to contribution of the elastic stress field and equilibrium thermo - motion , the third term characterizes a part of the internal energy , arising due to non - equilibrium transient processes ( the necessity of its account is grounded in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the last term presents a part of the internal energy concentrated in defect subsystems .",
    "relation ( [ b2 ] ) in the case of arbitrary number of defect types can be generalized as @xmath28 and evolution eq .",
    "( [ b3 ] ) accordingly @xmath29    carrying out transformation of the legendre type , but with respect to the pair of thermodynamic variables of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we pass to a new thermodynamics potential @xmath30    it is not hard to show that for this function a relation @xmath31 is just , that is , the new function @xmath32 is related to the internal energies of @xmath33 in the same way as the classic ( thermal or oscillation ) free energy @xcite , if the entropy is formally taken instead the number of defects @xmath24 , and the temperature instead of the energy of defect @xmath23 . but with the second postulate of neet such the accordance is recognized , that is , the function @xmath32 can be interpreted , as a modified free energy , when the number of defects of @xmath24 is taken as an independent thermodynamic variable .",
    "if transformation ( [ b7 ] ) is done for all of types of defects , then such modified free energy will be the function of independent variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , that is , @xmath34 .",
    "argument for the internal energy is the defect densities , and for the modified free energy  the energy of defects , similar to the case of classic thermodynamics , where an",
    "argument for internal energy is the entropy , and for free energy is the temperature .",
    "classical configurational free energy @xmath35 is always treated , as one - to - one function of the density of defects , while in obedience to the method of definition ( legendre transformation ) it must be the function of temperature .",
    "it follows that it is not a thermodynamics potential in a strict sense , and it is only useful as energy reflection of pdf . while the internal energy and the modified free energy , satisfying eqs .",
    "( [ b5 ] ) , ( [ b6 ] ) and ( [ b8 ] ) , are real thermodynamics potentials , though dissatisfy extreme principle .",
    "now setting the dependence of the internal energy on its arguments , we fully determine our problem in a thermodynamic sense .",
    "let us apply the above approach for solution of a special problem . producing a fine - grained structure of metals by severe plastic deformation ( spd ) is presently urgent .",
    "at the initial stage of spd there goes intensive generation of dislocations , then next the dislocations serve as a building material for the growth of grain boundaries , that results in a finer grain structure .",
    "thus , in the processes of spd these two types of defects take the main part and predetermine the two - level character of the problem @xcite .",
    "let us consider a homogeneous problem , setting the internal energy as a polynomial dependence @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are some coefficients , depending on the equilibrium variables of @xmath40 and @xmath19 , as control parameters @xmath41 for the sake of convenience we passed from the numbers of defects of @xmath24 to the densities of corresponding variables of @xmath42 , and similarly @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the fourth - degree polynomial in parentheses can have at the positive values of coefficients @xmath45 two maxima ( two modes ) .",
    "the mode which corresponds to the lower value of defectiveness , in the case of dislocations @xmath46 , can describe the accidental ( homogeneous ) distribution of dislocations .",
    "the mode , which corresponds to the higher value of defectiveness , describes dislocations belonging to the cell structure in this case .",
    "we examine only the simplified case of the homogeneous distribution of dislocations , that is , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath49 can be considered as a general surface density of the energy of regular ( infinity ) gb . from data of s.a .",
    "firstov , for cold - roll treatment this energy can equal the doubled energy of a free boundary for same material .",
    "for example , it can make approximately @xmath50 for copper .",
    "the first term in this context is the own energy of the boundary without a contribution from other factors .",
    "it is considered , as a well full - relaxated grain boundary , that is , as a minimum possible surface energy of gb . according to a.s .",
    "firstov , this energy makes @xmath51 of the energy of free - surface of the same material .",
    "that is , for copper this energy approximately equals @xmath52 .",
    "contribution of the second term @xmath53 to the field of compressing hydrostatic stress results in the decreasing of gb energy .",
    "it is of great physical importance meaning that the grain boundaries are sites of density lack distributed along some surface .",
    "exactly these sites give the highest contribution to the energy of boundaries .",
    "when , due to external pressure , the volume of undensitied sites diminishes , the energy of boundaries diminishes , as well as the potential barriers between the stable neighbor states , that results in growing mobility of the grain boundaries . if elastic deformation is @xmath54 that for copper corresponds to the level of tension @xmath55 , the constant gg is to be taken within the limits of @xmath56 . for",
    "such value of constant gg the energy of grain boundaries will diminish within the limits of @xmath57 @xmath58 of its value for a relaxed boundary .",
    "the terms in eq .",
    "( [ b10 ] ) proportional to @xmath59 and @xmath60 must give at the same level of elastic stress of @xmath61 , such contribution , when general effective energy of gb might not exceed the double energy of the free boundary ( for copper @xmath62 ) .",
    "it gives conditions for choosing constants in the limits @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the values of these constants are different because the effects of shear are of greater significance for structural rearrangement of the solid .",
    "other constants are chosen issuing from the reasoning that the equilibrium ( stationary ) values of the density of grain boundaries were in the interval observed in experiments .",
    "for the grain boundaries these are two steady states with the density in a region @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where the average grain size is @xmath67 and @xmath68 , accordingly .",
    "the same reasoning can be repeated for dislocations .",
    "the minimum excess energy of dislocations , in the absence of other factors for copper , equals approximately @xmath69 @xcite .    using eq .",
    "( [ b5 ] ) , which is true for both the equilibrium and non - equilibrium cases , one gets evolution eqs ( [ b6 ] ) in the form @xmath70 ,   \\\\ \\dfrac{\\partial h_{g}}{\\partial t}=-\\gamma_{h_{g}}[\\varphi_{gd}(h_{d}-h_{de})+\\varphi(h_{g}-h_{ge})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71    as seen , the evolution equations do not directly depend on the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath49 , but can depend on them through the equilibrium values @xmath73 and @xmath74 . for determination of this dependence",
    "it is necessary to find position of the maxima of pdf .",
    "as for basic defects , participating in spd , this function is unknown ; it creates some difficulties in application of the theory for calculation of specific systems . for overcoming the difficulties",
    "let us consider the method of effective potential in terms of the internal energy .",
    "let us suppose that the equilibrium energy of defect le weakly depends on a current value of the density of defects , and it can be brought under the sign of differentiation in eq .",
    ". then one can introduce the effective internal energy @xmath75    the evolution eq .",
    "( [ b6 ] ) assumes a form @xmath76    here the plus sign is selected in case if an equilibrium value @xmath77 is in the region of convexity of the internal energy @xmath78 , the minus sign is selected in the region of its concavity @xcite . in the first case",
    "a stationary solution corresponds to a maximum of the effective energy , in the second case a stationary solution corresponds to its minimum .",
    "formally , eq . ( [ b10 ] ) realizes an extreme principle , as its stationary points coincide with a maximum or a minimum of the effective potential of the internal energy @xmath79 .",
    "we take the effective energy in the same form ( [ b9 ] ) as the initial internal energy u with the same coefficients of presentation ( [ b10 ] ) with the only difference that the equilibrium energy of @xmath77 is included in coefficient of @xmath80 , that is , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "[ f1] it is evident , that kinetics of grain boundaries and dislocations during the structural phase transition is closely correlated . at the first stage a growth in the number of dislocations initiates growth of grain boundaries and provokes the beginning of the structural phase transition . during the structural phase transition ,",
    "when the density of dislocations has already gone on a stationary plateau , vice versa , the growth of grain boundaries provokes the growth of the density of dislocations .",
    "thus , in this area , dislocations follow the grain boundaries in repeating the shape of curve of the structural phase transition , but to more weak extent .      as known the law of strengthening results from dislocation mobility decrease due to braking by different defects , as well as by dislocations from other slide planes . at the dislocation level",
