    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism is a fundamental constituent of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite of electroweak interactions . despite its relevance ,",
    "the experimental information on the higgs sector of the sm is scarce and indirect at present .",
    "the search for the higgs particle is a key issue for present and future high - energy colliders , and any deviation from expectations could be a clear guide for new physics scenarios beyond the sm .",
    "the sm can be extended via a linear representation of the @xmath15 symmetry breaking mechanism @xcite .",
    "the lowest order representation corresponds to the standard model , while at higher orders new interactions between the higgs particle and gauge bosons become possible .",
    "they modify the production mechanisms and decay properties of the higgs .",
    "the relevant cp - invariant lagrangian terms for neutral bosons are the following @xcite : @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the photon , @xmath20 and higgs fields , respectively , and @xmath21 .",
    "the couplings @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be parametrized as follows @xcite : @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the @xmath30 coupling constant , @xmath31 is the weak mixing angle and @xmath32 is the @xmath33 mass .",
    "the five anomalous couplings @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath34 constitute a convenient set of adimensional parameters to describe deviations in higgs - vector boson interactions .",
    "they are not severely constrained by electroweak measurements at the z pole or low energies @xcite .",
    "the couplings @xmath11 and @xmath12 are commonly used in the context of @xmath35 studies @xcite , whereas the couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 are introduced according to the convention of reference .",
    "limits on the parameter @xmath36 , which quantifies deviations in the magnitude of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 couplings @xcite have already been set @xcite and will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "a typical signature of anomalous couplings would be a large cross section for a non - standard higgs production mechanism such as @xmath0 .",
    "another possible effect is the observation of large @xmath7 and @xmath8 branching fractions , which are zero in the sm at tree level .",
    "in addition , a search for anomalous higgs production with non - zero @xmath11 or @xmath12 couplings offers a complementary way to look for the same type of deviations which may be present in the @xmath35 process .",
    "the data used in this analysis were collected with the l3 detector @xcite at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath39 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of @xmath4 .",
    "previous experimental analyses on anomalous higgs production accompanied by photons are discussed in reference .",
    "we search for a higgs particle emitted in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 processes .",
    "these processes may be enhanced by the presence of anomalous @xmath40 and @xmath41 couplings and have sensitivity to higgs masses up to the center - of - mass energy of the collision ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the analysis is complemented with a study of the @xmath1 process , which is sensitive to anomalous @xmath37 and @xmath41 couplings for higgs masses below the kinematic limit : @xmath43 .",
    "the feynman diagrams for these three anomalous processes are shown in figure [ figure : diagrams ] .    in order to search for the anomalous @xmath0 process ( figure [ figure : diagrams]a ) a dedicated generator is written .",
    "it implements the expected @xmath44 dependence for the differential cross section as a function of the higgs production angle , @xmath45 .",
    "the generator takes into account initial state radiation @xcite , photon emission by final - state particles @xcite , spin correlations and off - shell effects in cascade decays like @xmath46 .    the @xmath2 process ( figure [ figure : diagrams]b ) is interpreted as the production of a narrow - width spin - zero resonance ( the higgs particle ) in two - photon processes . for the generation of this process , the pc generator @xcite is used .",
    "the @xmath1 process , which is also affected by the presence of anomalous couplings @xcite ( figure [ figure : diagrams]c ) , is studied by reinterpreting the cross section limits obtained from the l3 sm @xcite and fermiophobic @xcite higgs searches .    the branching fractions and partial widths of an anomalous higgs",
    "are determined according to the calculations of references and .",
    "the search is restricted to the higgs mass range @xmath3 .",
    "the decay channels @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 are considered .",
    "the cases @xmath7 and @xmath8 complement each other in sensitivity , probing a large part of the parameter space .",
    "the @xmath6 decay is dominant in the parameter region where @xmath7 is strongly suppressed and @xmath8 is kinematically forbidden .",
    "the analysis is performed as a function of the higgs mass hypothesis .",
    "signal events are generated for the following six higgs masses : 70 , 90 , 110 , 130 , 150 and 170 gev .",
    "for each mass under consideration and for each possible production and decay mode , more than 2000 signal events are generated .",
    "for the study of sm backgrounds the following generators are considered : kk2f @xcite and pythia @xcite for @xmath47 contaminations , pythia for multiperipheral @xmath48 events , ggg @xcite for @xmath49 , koralw @xcite for @xmath35 , excalibur @xcite for @xmath50 and remaining four - fermion backgrounds at high invariant masses , and koralz @xcite for @xmath51 . in all cases",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) statistics used in the analysis is more than 10 times the statistics present in data , except for multiperipheral @xmath48 events , for which the relative factor is two .",
    "all mc samples are simulated in the l3 detector and reconstructed in the same way as data .",
    "time - dependent detector inefficiencies are taken into account .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath2 higgs production mechanisms lead to characteristic topologies . in the @xmath0 process",
    ", a high - energy photon of fixed energy is produced , and typically most of the collision energy is visible in the final state .",
    "events originating from a two - photon collision , @xmath2 , have missing longitudinal momentum and missing mass , as the two emerging electrons tend to escape detection at very low polar angles .",
    "the analysis of the specific channel @xmath52 , is based on the @xmath53 selection criteria described in reference .",
    "all analyses are performed in higgs mass steps of @xmath54 by interpolation of the generated higgs signal efficiencies .",
    "this is particularly relevant in the case of photonic higgs decays , where the good energy resolution of the l3 detector can be exploited efficiently .",
    "most of the analyses rely on photon identification .",
    "a photon is defined as a shower in the electromagnetic calorimeter with a profile consistent with that of an electromagnetic particle and no associated track in the vertex chamber .",
    "the photon candidates must satisfy @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the photon energy and @xmath58 is its polar angle .",
    "these cuts reduce the background associated to initial and final - state radiation , while keeping a large efficiency for the higgs signal .",
    "the identification of @xmath6 decays is also crucial in this study .",
    "the b - tagging performance is similar to the one obtained in the l3 sm higgs search  @xcite .      in order to select @xmath60 events we require three photon candidates with a total electromagnetic energy larger than @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , the invariant mass of at least one of the photon pairs in the event must be consistent with the higgs mass hypothesis within @xmath62 .",
    "after these cuts the contamination from processes other than @xmath49 is estimated to be negligible .",
    "figure [ fig : selplot]a presents the distribution of the invariant mass in data and in mc for one of the higgs mass hypotheses with largest signal significance .",
    "the number of expected and observed events , the signal efficiency in the full phase space , and the limit on @xmath63 are shown in table [ tab : ggg ] for several higgs mass hypotheses .",
    "no evidence for any anomalous signal is observed , leading to the 95% confidence level ( cl ) limits shown in figure [ fig : hg_limits ] . throughout this paper , a bayesian approach with a flat prior distribution is adopted in the derivation of the limits on the signal cross section .",
    ".number of selected candidates , background events , signal acceptance and 95% cl cross section limits after the @xmath60 selection for different higgs mass hypotheses .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the analyses performed over the different higgs production mechanisms and decay channels show that the experimental data agree with the sm mc predictions .",
    "this agreement is quantified in terms of limits on the anomalous parameters @xmath64 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "exclusion limits for each individual coupling are derived as a function of the higgs mass following criteria similar to the ones employed in the sm higgs search @xcite . for a given coupling @xmath65 , a point in the @xmath66 plane",
    "is considered as excluded at the 95% cl or more if the ratio of the confidence level for the `` signal+background '' hypothesis to the confidence level for the `` background - only '' hypothesis is less than @xmath67 . in this study",
    "all other couplings are assumed to be zero .",
    "the results for the four parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are shown in figures [ fig : lim_d ] and [ fig : lim_dw ] .",
    "in addition to the combined results obtained using all processes under study , the individual results for the most sensitive channels are also displayed .    in all cases ,",
    "the @xmath1 searches are enough to exclude the region @xmath68 for any value of the anomalous coupling .",
    "the fermiophobic @xmath69 search is sensitive to large values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , for which there is an enhancement of the @xmath7 branching fraction .",
    "the standard search for @xmath70 covers the region @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath60 and @xmath72 channels are sensitive to large values of @xmath73 couplings , i.e. to large values of the combination @xmath74 ( figure [ fig : lim_d ] ) . on the contrary , the @xmath75 process has a dominant role when @xmath7 is suppressed ( figure [ fig : lim_dw ] ) .",
    "this is the case for the fits to @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the higgs mass range @xmath76 .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath77 channel ( figure [ fig : lim_dw ] at @xmath78 ) concerns the region in which @xmath7 is small , the @xmath41 coupling is large and the @xmath8 decay is kinematically not possible .",
    "the reduced sensitivity of the @xmath79 process is due to the strong decrease of the @xmath6 branching fraction in the presence of large @xmath40 couplings .",
    "the sensitivity of the analysis degrades rapidly when @xmath80 approaches the @xmath81 threshold , where the @xmath82 decay becomes dominant even in the presence of relatively large anomalous couplings .",
    "another usual assumption @xcite is to consider that all anomalous interactions have the same strength @xmath83 at the scale of new physics @xmath84 , i.e. @xmath85 .",
    "this choice , although reasonable in what concerns orders of magnitude , is very particular .",
    "it implies the absence of an anomalous @xmath8 decay and a large exclusion power for the channels sensitive to the @xmath40 coupling .",
    "we show the excluded regions under this assumption in figures [ fig : lim_d ] and [ fig : lim_dw ] .",
    "the 95% cl contours obtained from a likelihood fit in the @xmath86 plane , taking into account all analyzed processes , are shown in figure [ fig : ddb_all ] for different higgs masses . in this fit",
    "we assume that the couplings @xmath11 and @xmath12 are zero .",
    "the @xmath75 process helps in excluding large values of the anomalous couplings in the region where @xmath87 .",
    "the fit is reinterpreted as a fit in the ( @xmath88 ) plane .",
    "the results are also presented in figure [ fig : ddb_all ] for different higgs masses .",
    "we wish to express our gratitude to the cern accelerator divisions for the excellent performance of the lep machine .",
    "we acknowledge the contributions of the engineers and technicians who have participated in the construction and maintenance of this experiment .",
