    "although more than forty years have passed since the discovery of the kondo effect , it is still one of the most interesting topics in condensed matter physics ; it lies at the heart of understanding strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "@xcite the kondo effect , which leads to the quenching of an impurity spin , forms the basis of the physics of a single magnetic impurity embedded in a metal . in order to understand the kondo effect ,",
    "the anderson model  @xcite has been applied with great success . in the theoretical studies",
    ", one generally assumes an impurity level to be embedded in a noninteracting conduction band .    in the past",
    "a system of magnetic ions coupled to ( strongly ) correlated conduction electrons has attracted considerable interest in connection with heavy - fermion behavior , namely nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite this raised the question whether correlations among conduction electrons affect substantially the expected formation of heavy quasiparticles .",
    "@xcite so far a number of authors have studied models of a single magnetic impurity embedded in a host of correlated conduction electrons .",
    "thereby perturbation theory and other approximation schemes were applied .",
    "@xcite for example , it was shown that the kondo scale can increase exponentially in the weak - coupling regime with increasing interaction of the conduction electrons .",
    "@xcite but a quantitative theory is still missing . moreover",
    "the case of strongly correlated conduction electrons with band filling slightly less than one - half ( hole doping ) is still an open problem .",
    "in this paper we study a single magnetic impurity coupled to a correlated electron system .",
    "the latter is assumed to be one dimensional ( 1d ) and described by a hubbard hamiltonian . using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method",
    ", we calculate the binding energy of the impurity - induced bound state and spin - spin correlation functions between the impurity and the correlated electrons in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "special attention is paid to the case of a nearly half - filled conduction band with repulsive electron - electron interactions . for a 1d correlated host ,",
    "there have been numerical study for similar models  @xcite as well as an analytical study for a integrable model .",
    "@xcite we hope that the present investigation will contribute to better insights .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce our model , i.e. , a magnetic impurity coupled to a hubbard chain . in sec .",
    "iii , we give some numerical details of the dmrg method applied here . in sec .",
    "iv , we first present calculated results for the binding energy and spin - spin correlation functions at half filling , and discuss the effect of the host - band correlations on the kondo physics .",
    "then , we consider the evolution of the same quantities with hole doping .",
    "iv contains a summary of the results and the discussions .",
    "we study a magnetic impurity coupled to a 1d correlated electron system .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of three terms @xmath3 the first term @xmath4 represents 1d correlated electrons . here",
    "we describe them by a hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) at site @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the number operator .",
    "furthermore @xmath12 is the hopping integral between neighboring sites and @xmath13 is the onsite coulomb interaction .",
    "the second term @xmath14 is the orbital energy of the magnetic impurity site .",
    "we assume that the impurity contains one orbital , e.g. , 4_f _ and the coulomb repulsion on the orbital @xmath15 is infinite .",
    "since double occupancies are excluded , i.e. , the _ f _ orbital is either empty or singly occupied , the impurity site is given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "for convenience , we define @xmath19(@xmath20 ) and label an electron on the impurity site as `` _ f _ electron '' .",
    "the third term @xmath21 involves the interaction between the impurity site and the correlated electron system .",
    "the interaction is assumed to be local and described by a hybridization like in the anderson model , i.e. , the impurity site is hybridized with a single site ( denoted as site @xmath22 ) of the correlated electron system .",
    "thus , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hopping integral between the impurity site and site @xmath22 . the lattice structure is shown in fig .",
    "we will work in units where @xmath25 and take as typical values @xmath26 and @xmath27 , throughout .",
    "we employ the dmrg method , which is one of the most powerful numerical techniques for studying quantum lattice many - body systems including quantum impurity systems .",
    "@xcite with the dmrg method , we can obtain ground - state and low - lying excited - states energies , as well as expectation values of physical quantities quite accurately for very large finite - size systems .    in order to carry out our calculations , we consider @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) electrons ( @xmath28 : even ) in a system consisting of a chain of @xmath30sites correlated electron system ( @xmath30 : odd ) and a single impurity site .",
    "the electron density is defined as @xmath31 .",
    "note that the number of lattice sites must be taken as @xmath32 with @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) being an integer to maintain the total spin of the ground state as @xmath35 . if one chooses it as @xmath36 , the singlet and triplet states are degenerate .",
    "we now apply the open - end boundary conditions to the 1d correlated electron system and assume that the impurity site is hybridized with the central site of the 1d open chain .",
    "the latter corresponds to site @xmath22 , and sites @xmath10 and @xmath37 are equivalent . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the half - filled and hole - doped cases ( @xmath38 ) .    regarding quantum impurity problems , it is generally complicated for finite - size calculations to obtain accurate results in the thermodynamic limit @xmath39 because of finite - size effects . in our calculations ,",
    "the most problematic finite - size effects are friedel oscillations due to the open ends of the hubbard chain .",
    "mostly , the energy scale of the kondo physics is exponentially small ; nevertheless , friedel oscillations can persist even at the center of the chain as they decay as a power - law from the edge sites .",
    "therefore , we study several long chains with sites @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , and then perform the finite - size - scaling analysis based on the size - dependent quantities .",
    "all dmrg results in this paper are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit @xmath39 . for precise calculations we keep up to @xmath48 density - matrix eigenstates in the dmrg procedure .",
    "in this way , the maximum error in the ground - state energy is below @xmath49 .",
    "we first study the binding energy between the _ f _ electron and the correlated electrons .",
    "it corresponds to an energy gain due to the formation of a kondo ( or local ) singlet bound state .",
    "hence , the binding energy is given by an energy difference between the first triplet excited state and the singlet ground state , @xmath51 with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the ground state energy in a system of @xmath54 sites with @xmath55 up - spin and @xmath56 down - spin electrons .",
    "note that , at half filling , the system is insulating for finite @xmath13 .",
    "the bound state therefore may be from as a local singlet rather than the kondo singlet . here and",
    "in the following we will speak of a kondo singlet only if it involves more than the central site of the correlated electrons .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , we show the dmrg results of the binding energy @xmath57 as a function of the coulomb interaction @xmath13 for various parameter sets . in total , the results for the different parameter sets are qualitatively the same ; as @xmath13 increases , the binding energy rises rapidly for small @xmath13 , reaches a maximum around @xmath58 and decreases gradually for large @xmath13 .",
    "this behavior is similar to the dependence of the effective heisenberg interaction on the coulomb interaction in the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "@xcite accordingly , the dmrg results show that for large values of @xmath13 the binding energy is approximately proportional to the effective exchange coupling @xmath59 , between the impurity and site @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite if we assume that the effective exchange coupling results from second - order perturbation , i.e. , @xmath60 , we can explain why the results for @xmath61 are about four times larger than those for @xmath62 .",
    "this estimation of the effective exchange coupling is also consistent with a slight decrease of the binding energy with increasing @xmath63 .",
    "let us now consider the behavior in the limiting cases for weak and strong interaction strengths . a magnified view of the weak - coupling regime ( @xmath64 ) for @xmath65 is given in fig .  [ fig2](b ) .",
    "when @xmath66 , the system is metallic and essentially equivalent to the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) in the kondo limit ( @xmath67 ) but asymmetric case ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the orbital energy of the impurity site is lower than the fermi energy of the conduction band , so that the occupation number of the impurity site is always @xmath69 .",
    "the exchange interaction @xmath59 is estimated to be the order of @xmath70 and , therefore , the binding energy is expected to be very small but finite .",
    "we estimate it to be roughly @xmath71 .",
    "this value is compatible with the kondo temperature @xmath72 in the asymmetric siam .",
    "@xcite the introduction of a finite coulomb interaction makes the system insulating . with increasing @xmath13 , @xmath57 increases gradually when @xmath73 and rapidly for @xmath74 .",
    "there is a crossover from the kondo singlet to a local singlet around @xmath75 .",
    "assuming an exponential behavior of @xmath57 with @xmath13 leads to a good fitting of the dmrg data , i.e. , @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath57 increases almost linearly in the regime @xmath79 .",
    "we thus find that the binding energy of the local singlet can be a few orders of magnitude larger than that of the kondo singlet .",
    "the dmrg results for the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath80 ) with @xmath81 and @xmath61 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) . in this regime ,",
    "the electrons are strongly localized at each site .",
    "therefore , the system ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be reduced to the heisenberg model with hamiltonian @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "the dmrg data can be fitted quite well by a function @xmath84 with @xmath85 . despite the strong localization of the electrons",
    "the binding energy is two orders of magnitude smaller than the _ cf _ exchange coupling .",
    "this is because for @xmath50 a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) is forming in the chain for any value of @xmath13 ( @xmath20 ) which makes the formation of the local singlet state more difficult .",
    "we note that the behavior of the binding energy for finite @xmath13 is essentially the same as that of the nel temperature in the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "@xcite      in the kondo problem , the spin degrees of freedom around the impurity play an essential role .",
    "therefore , we investigate spin - spin correlations between the _ f _ electron and the correlated electrons .",
    "the correlated system is now described by the lattice model [ eq.([hamconduction ] ) ] , so that we are allowed to study the distance @xmath86 dependence of correlation functions , like @xmath87 .",
    "let us first derive the spin - spin correlations between the spin on the impurity site and on the central site @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "the dmrg results for various parameter sets are shown in fig.[fig3](a ) as function of the coulomb interaction @xmath13 .",
    "since the antiferromagnetic correlation is derived from the _ cf _ exchange interaction , @xmath89 is negative for all parameter sets and coulomb interaction strengths .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath89 increases with increasing @xmath24 and with decreasing @xmath90 , as expected from the behavior of the binding energy . however , the influence of @xmath90 is rather smaller . in the limit @xmath91",
    ", @xmath89 is antiferromagnetic but the magnitude is very small due to strong charge fluctuations , when the system is metallic [ see inset of fig.[fig3](a ) ] .",
    "it reflects the small binding energy around @xmath66 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath89 increases with increasing @xmath13 and reaches its maximum value as @xmath92 , which means that one electron is localized on each site in that limit .",
    "we consider next spin - spin correlations between a spin on the impurity site and on the next - nearest - neighbor site @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath94 . in fig.[fig3](b ) , the dmrg results for @xmath94 are shown as a function of the coulomb interaction @xmath13 for various parameter sets .",
    "one expects ferromagnetic correlations from the effective hamiltonian ( [ heisham ] ) for finite values of @xmath13 , and indeed @xmath94 has positive sign for all the parameter sets and coulomb interaction strengths .",
    "note that the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction induces ferromagnetic correlations , as substitute for the spin - spin interaction ( [ heisham ] ) , in the weak - coupling ( @xmath95 ) and metallic regimes .",
    "however , it is difficult to separate the contribution from rkky and the interaction ( [ heisham ] ) .",
    "the coulomb interaction dependence of @xmath94 is similar to that of @xmath89 . for the same parameter sets ,",
    "the value of @xmath94 is found to be slightly smaller than that of @xmath96 .",
    "this indicates a slow decay of the spin - spin correlation @xmath87 with distance @xmath86 .",
    "it implies that the spin of the _ f _ electron is hardly screened by the spin on site @xmath22 . in addition , the influence of @xmath24 on the spin - spin correlations is rather small .",
    "note that the binding energy depends strongly on the hybridization @xmath24 .",
    "let us now consider the distance dependence of the spin - spin correlation functions . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , we plot the dmrg results for @xmath87 as a function of distance @xmath86 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "we choose three coulomb interactions ; ( i ) @xmath98 in the kondo - singlet regime , ( ii ) @xmath99 in the limit of the local singlet regime , and ( iii ) @xmath100 in the intermediate regime where a maximal binding energy is obtained .",
    "the results for different distances are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit @xmath39 .",
    "we find that @xmath87 decays slowly and the sign changes alternately with @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 has a positive ( negative ) sign for odd ( even ) @xmath86 , denoted by solid ( empty ) symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "the interaction ( [ heisham ] ) and/or the rkky interactions cause ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) correlations between the spin of the _ f _ electron and that of the odd ( even ) site @xmath86 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath101 increases with increasing @xmath13 because larger coulomb interactions stabilize the @xmath102-sdw oscillation which accompanies charge localization .",
    "since the system is in a spin - gapped ground state , an exponential decay of the spin - spin correlation with distance must be expected . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) we present a semilogarithmic plot of @xmath87 as a function of distance @xmath86 . for a convenient comparison ,",
    "we have normalized @xmath87 with respect to its value at @xmath103 .",
    "the results can be fitted with a function @xmath104 and thus the exponential decay of the correlation functions is confirmed for all values of @xmath13 .",
    "the correlation lengths are estimated as @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 for @xmath98 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "they seem to be much longer than those of other standard spin - gapped systems , e.g. , @xmath110 in the two - leg isotropic heisenberg system .",
    "the large values of @xmath111 reflect exponentially small binding energies .",
    "they also mean that spin - polarized electrons are widely spread around the impurity site ,",
    "i.e. , the kondo screening effect is quite weak .",
    "furthermore , we note that the correlation functions decay rapidly around @xmath112",
    ". the decay rate is dependent of the magnitude of the _ cf _ exchange interaction .",
    "we are also interested in doped systems , which are metallic even if @xmath114 .",
    "we thus investigate the properties of the model  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath81 for various hole concentrations @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the number of doped holes ( @xmath117 ) . for this choice of @xmath118 ,",
    "the occupation number of the impurity site is near unity because the fermi level lies well above @xmath118 . in the strong coupling limit ( @xmath80 )",
    ", doubly occupied sites are excluded and therefore we can derive an effective model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) by applying degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite the effective hamiltonian is written as @xmath119 here @xmath120 is the kinetic - energy term of the conduction electrons @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore @xmath123 is a spin - coupling term between the conduction electrons , which is of the heisenberg type @xmath124 the sum of these two terms defines the 1d correlated electron system .",
    "it is essentially equivalent to a @xmath12@xmath125@xmath126 model except for small modifications around site @xmath22 due to the impurity .",

    "f _ electron .",
    "furthermore , @xmath129 is a spin - spin interaction term in analogy to the _ cf _ exchange interaction , @xmath130 with @xmath131 , where @xmath132 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the last term @xmath133 gives a correction to the effective model , @xmath134 .",
    "\\label{effcorr}\\ ] ] the first term of ( [ effcorr ] ) implies an antiferromagnetic interaction between the impurity site and site @xmath135 if there is a hole at site @xmath22 ; on the other hand , the second term gives a correction to the kondo - type interaction , i.e. , the first term of ( [ effkondo ] ) , and the antiferromagnetic spin exchange between the impurity site and site @xmath22 may be reduced .      of particular interest",
    "is the evolution of the binding energy of the impurity - induced bound state upon hole doping .",
    "we can easily imagine that the binding energy is suppressed by hole doping due to the enhancement of charge fluctuation .",
    "thus , away from half filling , the 1d correlated system is metallic and the bound state changes from a local singlet to the kondo singlet . if the bound state survives with hole doping , it has a much larger energy than the standard kondo singlet . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the binding energy @xmath57 as a function of band filling @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) at ( a ) @xmath61 and ( b ) @xmath62 with @xmath81 for various values of @xmath13 . filled ( empty ) symbols refer to the data for @xmath50 ( @xmath113 ) and empty symbols at @xmath50 represent the values for infinitesimally doped systems ( see below ) .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath57 is discontinuously reduced at @xmath50 and decreases with increasing hole doping for all cases except @xmath66 .",
    "we find however that @xmath57 remains of the same order of magnitude as in the half - filled case even at doping level up to a few percents .",
    "also , the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath13 is weaker for higher doping concentrations .",
    "more precisely , there are two differences in behavior on the hybridization strength @xmath24 .",
    "one is that in the vicinity of @xmath50 the binding energy for @xmath61 decreases more rapidly than that for @xmath62 despite larger _",
    "cf _ exchange coupling [ eq.([effkondo ] ) ] .",
    "it must be associated with the attraction between doped holes and the _ f _ electron , which is described in detail in the next paragraph .",
    "the other is that the binding energy disappears at lower doping levels for small values of @xmath24 ; @xmath57 for @xmath61 maintains its value at @xmath138 and that for @xmath62 goes to zero around @xmath139 .",
    "it results from the size of the _ cf _ exchange coupling @xmath140 , and thus the critical doping concentration is highest at @xmath58 giving a maximal value of @xmath140 .    for the limit @xmath141",
    "we have extrapolated the finite - size binding energy @xmath142 to the thermodynamic limit @xmath39 for the four - hole doped system by going up to @xmath143 .",
    "one notices that the value of the binding energy in the limit @xmath141 differs from the @xmath50 undoped value .",
    "it reflects the fact that the binding energy of the kondo singlet in the infinitesimally doped system is less than that of the local singlet in the undoped system .",
    "the reason being that , when the system is doped by a hole , the career tends to move onto site @xmath22 due to the attraction from the impurity site [ eq.([effpot ] ) ] and thus a spin - singlet formation is prevented .",
    "the discontinuity is higher for @xmath61 than for @xmath62 because the attractive interaction is enhanced by the hybridization @xmath24 .",
    "such a discontinuity of the spin - excitation energy has also been found in studies of ladder systems .",
    "@xcite note that in the hole - doped case the @xmath24 dependence of the binding energy is not simple because @xmath24 enhances two competing effects : ( i ) the attraction between doped holes and the _ f _ electron and ( ii ) the _ cf _ exchange coupling between conduction electrons and the _ f _ electron .",
    "finally , we study the hole - doping dependence of spin - spin correlations between the _ f_- and conduction electrons .",
    "the correlation is expected to be weakened by hole doping due to an increase of charge fluctuations . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show the spin - spin correlation functions @xmath89 and @xmath94 as a function of band filling @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) when ( a ) @xmath61 and ( b ) @xmath62 with @xmath81 for various coulomb interaction strengths . the properties are fundamentally linked to those of the binding energy as follows : ( i ) correlations are suppressed by hole doping and ( ii ) there exists a discontinuity at @xmath50 .",
    "let us now investigate the dmrg results for the two @xmath24 values .",
    "when @xmath61 , all the correlation functions for finite @xmath13 decrease rapidly close to @xmath50 and decay slowly when @xmath138 .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to that of the binding energy .",
    "it is seen that @xmath144 decreases with decreasing @xmath136 .",
    "the small value corresponds to a rapid decay of @xmath87 around @xmath103 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , e.g. , for @xmath98 and @xmath50 .",
    "it is accompanied by a transfer from the local singlet to the kondo singlet .",
    "it also suggests a reduction of the rkky interaction with doping .",
    "in addition , it is surprising that @xmath89 seems to be enlarged by hole doping for small values of @xmath13 ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "the `` exchange hole '' around the impurity is as a consequence of the pauli principle .",
    "when @xmath62 , all the correlation functions decrease monotonously and go to zero around @xmath146 , which is accompanied by a vanishing of the binding energy . for @xmath147 , @xmath148 has small negative values for large values of @xmath13 , which indicates antiferromagnetic correlations between the _ f _ electron and the spin at site @xmath69 .",
    "it is derived from the first term of ( [ effcorr ] ) and was previously suggested in ref.5 .",
    "using the dmrg method , we have studied a magnetic impurity embedded in a correlated electron system which is assumed to be the 1d hubbard chain . at half filling , we confirm that the binding energy increases exponentially in the weak - coupling regime . there is a crossover from the kondo singlet to the local singlet .",
    "the former state involves a wider spread of spin - polarized electrons around the impurity than the latter one .",
    "with increasing values of @xmath13 , the binding energy has a maximum around @xmath58 and afterwards decreases inversely proportional to the coulomb interaction .",
    "due to the formation of a singlet bound state , the spin - spin correlation function decays exponentially with distance from the impurity site for all values of @xmath13 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the correlation length is quite long when the binding energy is small .",
    "it becomes shorter with increasing coulomb interaction .",
    "for infinitesimally hole doping , we find a discontinuous reduction of the binding energy and of the spin - spin correlations from the values at half filling . for further doping , the binding energy is reduced but remains of the same order of magnitude as in the half - filled case even for doping concentration of a few percent .",
    "the electron - doped case is not studied here , but we expect qualitatively similar properties as for hole doping . however , there is no discontinuity at half filling .",
    "this is so because when an electron is added to the half - filled system it is distributed uniformly over the 1d chain except for site @xmath22 .",
