    "a collection of uniformly - sized balls in euclidean 3-space is called a _ packing _ if no two balls have a common interior point .",
    "we refer to such a packing as a _",
    "sphere packing_. the kepler conjecture asserts that the density of a packing of equal spheres in three - dimensions can not exceed that of the face - centered cubic packing .",
    "recently , thomas c. hales proposed a program designed to prove the kepler conjecture @xcite . this program proposes a formulation designed to reduce the complexity of the problem to a level tractable via modern methods .",
    "this formulation requires first that we define a decomposition of space , relative to a given packing of spheres .",
    "next , we define stars , based on the decomposition .",
    "we then define a local density for these stars .",
    "finally , we show that a sufficient local density bound for stars implies the required global density bound for the packing .",
    "in addition to the formulation of the conjecture , the hales program consists of five steps .",
    "an overview of the program detailing the content of each step can be found in @xcite .",
    "details of the formulation itself can be found in @xcite .",
    "we carry out step five of the program .",
    "a decomposition of space , relative to a given packing of spheres , is critical to the formulation of the program .",
    "our decomposition is inspired by the delaunay and voronoi decompositions , drawing from the advantages of each .",
    "we define a decomposition of space composed of a _",
    "@xmath0-system _ together with modified voronoi cells called _",
    "@xmath1-cells_. we first define the @xmath0-system , a partial decomposition of space , and then complete the decomposition by adding the @xmath1-cells .",
    "there are many possible decompositions which could be used in a similar approach to the conjecture .",
    "the challenge is to select a decomposition which brings each element of the proof within reach .",
    "this selection has not been at all easy .",
    "for example , both the delaunay and voronoi decompositions have critical defects which prevent their use .",
    "the @xmath0-system is so named because it consists of certain tetrahedrons called  and quarters .",
    "we say that two sets _ overlap _ if their relative interiors intersect . to define the @xmath0-system , we begin with an arbitrary saturated packing of spheres of radius one .",
    "we say that a packing is _ saturated _ if no more spheres may be added to the packing without overlapping spheres already in the packing .",
    "we consider only saturated packings , as we are looking for packings of maximal density .",
    "we identify the centers of the spheres as _ vertices _ of the packing . on occasion",
    ", we will distinguish a vertex of the packing , calling it the _",
    "origin_.      by connecting vertices in the packing , we can identify certain tetrahedrons .",
    "this identification is based on the length of the edges connecting the vertices .",
    "we label the edges and vertices of tetrahedrons as in figure  [ fig : tet ] .",
    "note that the order of the edge lengths determines which is the distinguished vertex of a tetrahedron .",
    "we define two types of tetrahedrons , a _ quasi - regular tetrahedron _ , called a _ _ , and a _",
    "quarter_. a  is a tetrahedron whose edge lengths each lie in the interval @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "a quarter is a tetrahedron with five edges with lengths in @xmath2 $ ] and one long edge with length in @xmath3 $ ] .    if a vertex of a quarter is distinguished , the quarter has two orientations : flat , and upright .",
    "a quarter is said to be _ flat _ if the distinguished vertex is opposite the long edge .",
    "similarly , a quarter is said to be _ upright _ if the distinguished vertex lies along the long edge .",
    "we refer to the long edge of a quarter as the _ diagonal_.    throughout this paper we introduce various special constants , such as @xmath4 .",
    "although they may appear to be rather mundane numbers , these constants have been carefully selected .",
    "it is usually the case that our selection comes from a range of numbers .",
    "we tend to choose numbers which are easily represented in decimal form , although for some purposes , numbers with a simple binary representation would be better .",
    "we do not mean to imply that our computations are made to only two - digit significance , nor that the selection of constants is arbitrary .",
    "if four quarters fit together along a common diagonal , forming a figure with six vertices , the resulting figure composed of quarters is called an _",
    "octahedron_. we use the term octahedron only when we refer to such a figure composed of quarters .",
    "an octahedron may have more than one diagonal of length at most @xmath5 , so the decomposition of an octahedron into quarters may not be unique .",
    "the @xmath0-system is a collection of non - overlapping  and quarters .",
    "we construct the @xmath0-system incrementally , building it from  and quarters .",
    "to begin , we identify all , quarters , and octahedra in the packing .",
    "we will define the @xmath0-system to be a subset of these structures .",
    "we consider each  and quarter in turn , choosing which ones we will add to the @xmath0-system .",
    "we first consider all identified octahedra . for each octahedron in the packing",
    ", we fix a diagonal of length at most @xmath5 , and place the four quarters along that diagonal in the @xmath0-system .",
    "next , we place all quasi - regular tetrahedra in the @xmath0-system . by lemmas  1.2 and 1.3 of @xcite , it is not possible for  to overlap either themselves or octahedra .",
    "next , we wish to place the rest of the quarters into the @xmath0-system .",
    "unfortunately , there is some ambiguity about how to do this without overlapping the quarters .",
    "the resolution of the ambiguities in placing quarters into the @xmath0-system is tedious .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "we say that two tetrahedra are _ adjacent _ if they share a face .",
    "the first ambiguity arises when we have two adjacent quarters , sharing a diagonal .",
    "if we identify their common vertex opposite the diagonal , they become flat quarters .",
    "it is possible that the same collection of vertices could be decomposed into two flat quarters with a different diagonal .",
    "we call this ambiguity a conflicting diagonal .",
    "it is not important for this paper which choice we make for the decomposition .",
    "making a selection when necessary , we place the adjacent quarters which share a diagonal into the @xmath0-system .",
    "the second ambiguity which arises is the case of two isolated , overlapping quarters . by isolated we mean that neither is adjacent to another quarter with which it shares a diagonal .",
    "if such a case arises , we place neither quarter in the @xmath0-system .    to complete the @xmath0-system ,",
    "we add all remaining unconsidered quarters , those which are isolated and which do not overlap anything else in the @xmath0-system .",
    "this completes the definition of the @xmath0-system .      the _ voronoi cell _ at a vertex of the packing consists of all points in space which are closer to that vertex than any other vertex of the packing .",
    "the voronoi decomposition of space is simply the collection of all voronoi cells .    to define a @xmath1-cell at a vertex @xmath6",
    ", we could take the intersection of the voronoi cell at @xmath6 with the complement of the @xmath0-system .",
    "however , this formulation leads to unnecessarily complex @xmath1-cells .",
    "this is due to the fact that a tetrahedron need not contain its circumcenter .    in order to define @xmath1-cells",
    ", we must first discuss the orientation of a vertex with respect to a face .",
    "if the circumcenter of a tetrahedron @xmath7 lies on the side of the plane @xmath8 through the face of @xmath7 opposite the vertex , we say that the face has _ negative orientation _ with respect to that vertex . to identify points lying on the side of @xmath8 opposite the vertex",
    ", we say that these points lie on the _ negative side _ of the face .",
    "by lemma  2.1 of @xcite , at most one face of a quarter or  has negative orientation .    if a face of an element @xmath7 of the @xmath0-system has negative orientation , the voronoi cell associated with the vertex of @xmath7 opposite that face will pass through the face , unless the voronoi cell is truncated by a vertex outside of @xmath7 .",
    "hence the tip of the voronoi cell protruding through the tetrahedron would be  orphaned \" in the sense that the tip would be part of the star but not be contiguous with the rest of the voronoi cell , since it will be separated by an element of the @xmath0-system . by design ,",
    "@xmath1-cells reapportion the protruding tip into the adjacent voronoi cells so that we may avoid this complication .",
    "the construction of the @xmath1-cells is somewhat complex .",
    "we first describe a vertex deletion process , which we will use to construct the @xmath1-cells .    for each negatively - oriented tetrahedron @xmath7",
    ", we distinguish the vertex @xmath9 opposite the negatively - oriented face .",
    "we define the _ tip _ of the voronoi cell associated with an isolated negatively - oriented tetrahedron @xmath7 to be the part of the voronoi cell determined by @xmath7 alone which lies on the negative side of the face opposite @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ fig : twodimvor ] represents the two - dimensional analog of a tip .",
    "each point @xmath10 outside the @xmath0-system lies in finitely many tips , each associated with a simplex @xmath7 with distinguished vertex @xmath9 .",
    "( typically , this collection of vertices will be empty . ) temporarily deleting these vertices from the packing , we take the voronoi decomposition of the remaining collection of vertices . the point @xmath10 lies in the modified voronoi cell at some new vertex @xmath11 .",
    "the deletion process therefore provides a mapping from the complement of the @xmath0-system to the vertices of the packing .",
    "we now consider a vertex @xmath6 of the packing .",
    "we define the @xmath1-cell at @xmath6 to be the set of points @xmath10 outside the @xmath0-system with the property that each lies in a modified voronoi cell at @xmath6 after the deletion process . that is , the @xmath1-cell at @xmath6 is the pre - image of @xmath6 under the mapping .",
    "the collection of  and quarters in the @xmath0-system together with all the @xmath1-cells comprises our decomposition of space , relative to a fixed packing of spheres .",
    "now that we have defined a decomposition of space relative to a packing , we can define a decomposition star relative to a vertex of the packing .",
    "we introduce the concept of a cluster of vertices , and then define a decomposition star in terms of the graph of the cluster .",
    "we define the _ height _ of a vertex to be its distance from the origin .",
    "fix the origin at a vertex of the packing .",
    "mark all vertices whose height is at most @xmath4 .",
    "the collection of marked vertices is called a _ cluster_.    if the distance between two vertices in the cluster does not exceed @xmath4 , join them by an edge .",
    "we call the resulting structure the _ graph _ of the cluster .",
    "next , project the graph radially to the unit sphere centered at the origin .",
    "this projection produces a partition of the surface into regions called _ standard regions_. by lemma  3.10 of @xcite , each edge projects to an arc on the unit sphere , and these arcs do not meet except at endpoints .",
    "we say that a vertex is _ enclosed _ over a figure if the vertex lies in the infinite cone at the origin generated by the figure .",
    "we associate a _ decomposition star _ with each vertex @xmath9 .",
    "we define a decomposition star as the union of the @xmath1-cell at @xmath9 with all the simplices in the @xmath0-system having a vertex at @xmath9 .",
    "decomposition stars and the standard regions have several important properties .",
    "in the most general terms , we wish to show that @xmath1-cells , the @xmath0-system and decomposition stars are compatible with standard regions . in the discussion which follows",
    ", we clarify this statement .",
    "we will define two properties , each of which depends on the local nature of @xmath1-cells and the @xmath0-system .",
    "these two properties define the compatibility of @xmath1-cells and the @xmath0-system with standard regions .",
    "the first property is that each  or quarter of a decomposition star lies inside the cone over a single standard region .",
    "the second property is somewhat harder to define .",
    "we define a _ quasi - regular face _ to be a triangle constructed from vertices in the packing , whose edge lengths lie in the interval @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "note that a side of a standard region corresponds to a quasi - regular face .    by lemma  2.2 of @xcite ,",
    "if a vertex has negative orientation with respect to a quasi - regular face , it must form a  with that face .    using this information",
    ", we now consider the intersection of a @xmath1-cell with the cone over a standard region .",
    "we claim that the shape of the @xmath1-cell inside the cone is completely determined by the vertices lying inside the cone .",
    "if a vertex @xmath6 outside the cone is to affect the @xmath1-cell inside the cone , it must have negative orientation with respect to a quasi - regular face @xmath12 corresponding to a side of the standard region . by the previous result ,",
    "the vertex @xmath6 must form a  with a face of the standard region .",
    "see 2.2 of @xcite .    by construction , if the voronoi cell at @xmath6 protrudes through @xmath12 , the protruding part is attached to the @xmath1-cells inside the cone .",
    "therefore the @xmath1-cell lying inside the cone over a standard region is completely determined by the vertices lying inside the cone .",
    "these properties of standard regions allow us to consider each standard region in isolation .",
    "if this were not possible , the treatment of each decomposition star would be hopelessly complex .      in our investigation of decomposition stars",
    ", we will need to consider the geometric arrangements associated with all possible standard regions .",
    "we call these arrangements standard clusters .",
    "we consider standard clusters in the context of decomposition stars .    specifically , the _ standard cluster _ associated with a standard region @xmath13 of a decomposition star is the union of the simplices in the decomposition star which lie in the cone over @xmath13 together with the part of the @xmath1-cell that lies over @xmath13 .",
    "the standard cluster associated with a triangular standard region is a .",
    "we call the standard cluster associated with a quadrilateral standard region a _ quad cluster_.      our treatment of decomposition stars requires that we classify all possible quad clusters .",
    "we single out quad clusters because the decomposition star which we treat in this paper has only triangular and quadrilateral standard regions .",
    "we call the four vertices of the packing which project to the vertices of the quadrilateral region the",
    "_ corners _ of the quad cluster .",
    "we give two exhaustive lists of the possible decompositions , based on the length of the diagonals between the corners of a quad cluster .",
    "if a quad cluster has a diagonal between two corners whose length does not exceed @xmath5 , there are three possible decompositions .",
    "first , the quad cluster could be composed of two flat quarters sharing the diagonal .",
    "we call this a _ flat _",
    "quad cluster .",
    "second , the quad cluster could be composed of two flat quarters sharing the other diagonal .",
    "third , the quad cluster could be composed of four upright quarters forming an octahedron .",
    "if both diagonals between the corners of a quad cluster have lengths which exceed @xmath5 , there are again three possible decompositions .",
    "first , the quad cluster could be an octahedron .",
    "second , there could be no enclosed vertex of height at most @xmath5 .",
    "we call such a quad cluster a _ pure voronoi _",
    "quad cluster , as it consists of only the part of the @xmath1-cell lying above the quadrilateral , since such a quad cluster can not contain any quarters .",
    "third , there could be an enclosed vertex of height at most @xmath5 .",
    "we call such arrangements _ mixed _ quad clusters , since they consist of zero or more upright quarters and portions of @xmath1-cells lying above the quadrilateral",
    ".      the next element in our formulation is a local density function for decomposition stars .",
    "we first construct a local density function for standard clusters .",
    "we will construct a local density function for decomposition stars by applying the local density function to each standard cluster in the star .",
    "the _ score _ of a standard cluster represents one of many possible local density functions applied to a standard cluster .",
    "the choice of function depends on the geometry of the standard cluster in question .",
    "our selection is made in an attempt to produce the best possible bounds on the local density .    in this paper",
    "we construct scoring functions only for  and quad clusters .",
    "the scoring functions for other standard clusters can be found in other papers in the program .",
    "we further subdivide our scoring functions , applying them to component quarters of quad clusters .",
    "we define functions on tetrahedrons in terms of the edge lengths @xmath14 of a tetrahedron .",
    "the first three edges @xmath15 are adjacent to the distinguished vertex or origin .",
    "edge @xmath16 lies opposite edge @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "we use several distinct scoring functions .",
    "these functions are typically linear combinations of voronoi volume and solid angle . to define these scoring functions , we require some intermediate definitions .",
    "we define the solid angle _",
    "sol(s ) _ of a tetrahedron @xmath7 with distinguished vertex @xmath9 to be three times the volume of the intersection of the unit ball at @xmath9 with the infinite cone on @xmath7 with origin at @xmath9 .",
    "the units of solid angle are therefore steradians .",
    "we define the geometric voronoi volume of a tetrahedron @xmath7 with distinguished vertex @xmath9 to be the volume occupied by points of @xmath7 lying closer to @xmath9 than to the other vertices of the tetrahedron .",
    "we define the analytic voronoi volume @xmath19 of a tetrahedron @xmath7 with distinguished vertex @xmath9 to be the analytic continuation of the formula for the geometric voronoi volume which holds when @xmath7 contains its circumcenter .",
    "the analytic voronoi volume is identical to the geometric voronoi volume only when @xmath7 contains its circumcenter .",
    "however , the sum of the analytic voronoi volumes at all four vertices of @xmath7 is equal to the volume of @xmath7 .",
    "this property allows us to produce a global density bound from a bound on the score of a decomposition star .",
    "finally , let @xmath20 .",
    "we define three scoring functions for tetrahedrons .",
    "the simplest is called vor analytic or _ vor _ , taking its name from the analytic voronoi volume .",
    "the vor analytic scoring @xmath21 of a tetrahedron @xmath7 is given by @xmath22 . here _",
    "vol _ denotes the analytic voronoi volume at the distinguished vertex @xmath9 .",
    "averaging @xmath21 over the two vertices adjacent to the long edge of an upright quarter gives _",
    "octavor_. that is , if the long edge of an upright quarter is @xmath23 , @xmath24    the average of @xmath21 over all four vertices of a tetrahedron gives _",
    "gma _ , which we also call the _ compression _ of a tetrahedron .",
    "that is ,    @xmath25    our method for choosing the scoring function for a particular tetrahedron depends on whether it is a  or a quarter .",
    "if the circumradius of a  @xmath7 is less than @xmath26 , we score @xmath7 by compression . otherwise , we score @xmath7 using vor analytic .      for quarters ,",
    "the scoring system depends on both the orientation of the quarter and the circumradii of the faces adjacent to the diagonal .",
    "if the circumradius of each of the adjacent faces to the diagonal is less than @xmath27 , the quarter is scored using compression .",
    "otherwise , flat quarters are scored using vor analytic , and upright quarters are scored using _",
    "octavor_.      the last element to be scored is the intersection of a @xmath1-cell with the cone over a standard region .",
    "call this intersection @xmath7 .",
    "such elements are scored using voronoi scoring .",
    "that is , they are scored using the usual formula @xmath22 , where in this case @xmath19 represents the volume of @xmath7 , and @xmath28 represents three times the volume of the intersection of @xmath7 with the unit ball at the origin .      if a quad cluster contains only vertices whose height exceeds @xmath29 , we may bound the score of the quad cluster by using _ truncated voronoi _ , meaning that the @xmath1-cell is truncated at a distance of @xmath27 from the distinguished vertex .",
    "as this method decreases the volume term , it provides an upper bound on the voronoi score .",
    "the bound on scoring is then @xmath30 , where in this case , @xmath31 denotes the truncated voronoi volume associated with the distinguished vertex , and @xmath32 denotes the solid angle associated with the distinguished vertex .",
    "the selection of the scoring functions was a challenging part of the formulation of the problem .",
    "compression arose as a natural local density function for the delaunay decomposition .",
    "similarly , @xmath33 arose as a local density function for the voronoi decomposition . the scoring formulation which we exhibit is the result of much experimentation .",
    "we use the following functions : _ sol _ , the spherical angle associated with the distinguished vertex of a tetrahedron or quad cluster , _ dih _ , the dihedral angle associated with the first edge of a tetrahedron , _ vor _ , the vor analytic score of a tetrahedron , _ octavor _ , the averaged vor analytic score of an upright quarter , _ gma _ , the compression of a tetrahedron , and _ sc _ , a generic name for the score of a tetrahedron or quad cluster .    explicit formulas for these special functions are available in @xcite .",
    "we realize that our naming conventions are somewhat cumbersome .",
    "initially , we gave traditional symbols to the special functions .",
    "for example , we referred to @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "however , as the library of functions increased , it became simpler to give each function a name which could be written easily in both _",
    "mathematica _ and c. greek symbols do not have this property .",
    "the score of a decomposition star is the sum of the scores of the standard clusters which comprise the star , such as  and quad clusters .",
    "we find it useful to define a _",
    "point _ to be the score of a regular tetrahedron ( whose edge lengths are @xmath36 ) , @xmath37      the final part of our formulation of the kepler conjecture requires that we demonstrate how a scoring bound on all decomposition stars implies a global bound on the density of a packing .",
    "our formulation expresses the required global density bound of @xmath38 in terms of a proposed bound on the score of a decomposition star .",
    "together , the five steps in the hales program will imply that the score of any decomposition star does not exceed @xmath39 .    in order to produce the transition between local and global density bounds , we first discuss the essential equivalence of all of the scoring methods .",
    "recall that the analytic voronoi decomposition of a tetrahedron produces a partition with four pieces .",
    "we compute the analytic voronoi score of a tetrahedron using the analytic continuation of the volume of the piece containing the distinguished vertex . adding these four ( analytically continued ) volumes",
    "gives the volume of the tetrahedron .",
    "if we average @xmath40 over all vertices of a tetrahedron @xmath7 , regardless of the scoring method , we arrive at @xmath41 . in this sense ,",
    "the different scoring schemes for tetrahedra are all equivalent .",
    "recall that @xmath41 is a linear combination of the volume of @xmath7 and the sum of the solid angles at each vertex of @xmath7 .",
    "that is , @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the solid angle of @xmath7 at vertex @xmath44 .",
    "recall that the voronoi score of a @xmath1-cell at a vertex @xmath6 is @xmath45 where @xmath31 represents the volume of the @xmath1-cell and @xmath32 represents the solid angle at @xmath6 of the @xmath1-cell",
    ".    begin with a sphere of radius @xmath13 , containing @xmath46 vertices .",
    "assume that the proposed bound , @xmath47 holds for every decomposition star .",
    "add this bound for every star in the sphere .",
    "call the sum of the scores @xmath48 .",
    "each tetrahedron is shared by four stars .",
    "therefore the contribution to @xmath48 from each tetrahedron @xmath7 is @xmath49 .",
    "the volume terms add up to @xmath50 ( neglecting the boundary ) , and the solid angles add to give @xmath51 , the volume of the unit balls within the sphere of radius @xmath13 .",
    "the boundary term is negligible as @xmath52 .",
    "this gives , up to a negligible boundary term , @xmath53 the density of balls within the sphere ( again , up to a negligible boundary term ) is then @xmath54    simplifying the right hand side , we find that it is equal to the desired bound , @xmath38 .",
    "therefore the density of any packing can not exceed the conjectured bound of @xmath38 .    for a more detailed account of this computation ,",
    "see @xcite .    the proposed @xmath39 bound",
    "is achieved by the decomposition star of the face - centered cubic lattice packing .",

    "each  in this star scores @xmath55 , the maximum possible score of a .",
    "each quad cluster scores @xmath56 , the maximum score of a quad cluster .",
    "hence the score of a face - centered cubic star is @xmath39 .",
    "having introduced our formulation of the kepler conjecture , we can now define the subject of this paper , the pentahedral prism .",
    "the pentahedral prism arises as a decomposition star in a saturated packing of 3-space with spheres of unit radius .",
    "it is a particular cluster with twelve vertices ( not counting the origin ) .",
    "see figure  [ fig : penta2 ] .",
    "the pentahedral prism is characterized by the arrangement and combinatorics of its standard regions .",
    "it is composed of ten triangular standard regions , and five quadrilateral standard regions .",
    "the ten triangles are arranged in two _ pentahedral caps _ , five triangles arranged around a common vertex .",
    "the five quadrilaterals lie in a band between the two caps .",
    "see figure  [ fig : penta ] .",
    "recall that the standard cluster attached to a triangular standard region is a .",
    "likewise , the standard cluster attached to a quadrilateral is a quad cluster .",
    "we use the term pentahedral cap to refer to both the standard regions and the  which comprise it .",
    "the five steps in the hales program @xcite are    1 .   a proof that even if all standard regions of a decomposition star are triangular the score is less than @xmath39 .",
    "2 .   a proof that standard clusters in regions of more than three sides score at most @xmath56 .",
    "3 .   a proof that if all of the standard regions of a decomposition star are triangles or quadrilaterals , then the score does not exceed @xmath39 ( excluding the case of the pentahedral prism ) .",
    "4 .   a proof that if some standard region has more than four sides , then the star scores less than @xmath39 . 5 .   a proof that the pentahedral prism scores less than @xmath39 .",
    "these steps were originally intended to be of roughly equal magnitude . due to changes in our formulation of the decomposition of space and the local density function ,",
    "some steps have become easier to complete than others .    in the earliest formulation ,",
    "the pentahedral prism could score more than @xmath39 .",
    "it appeared , on an experimental basis , to be the sole counterexample to the potential success of the program . to a certain degree ,",
    "the pursuit of a proof of step five drove the evolution of both the decomposition of space and the local density function .",
    "the pentahedral prism still comes remarkably close to achieving the optimal local density , that achieved by the decomposition stars of the face - centered cubic lattice packing , which score @xmath39 . in this sense",
    ", we consider the pentahedral prism to be a  worst case \" decomposition star .",
    "as such , it required the devotion of much time and resources .",
    "techniques which we developed to handle this case have proven to have significant impact on other steps of the program ( as , conversely , techniques from other steps have affected this one ) .",
    "thus far , the relations required to treat the pentahedral prism have been delicate in contrast to the more general bounds which have to date sufficed to treat other decomposition stars .",
    "as of this writing , steps i and ii are complete @xcite .",
    "hales has exhibited partial results for iii and iv .",
    "the nomenclature for the star which we treat in step five is somewhat problematic .",

    "in addition , it is denoted a  pentagonal prism \" in @xcite . with a similar degree of inaccuracy",
    ", we could also call it a  pentangular prism \" .",

    "therefore the volume is increasing in @xmath95 , so to increase the score , we should push the vertex in along the edge .",
    "the verification of the sign of the polynomial is found in calculation  [ d : dimred ] .",
    "the validity of a similar reduction argument for voronoi scoring of a quad cluster is obvious , since the voronoi volume is increasing in @xmath95 .",

    "however , the majority of the relations which we wish to prove are complex enough that a direct approach rapidly overwhelms our available resources .      we are required to prove that the score of a quarter is nonpositive .",
    "quarters are either flat or upright .",

    "upright quarters occurring in a quad cluster are scored using either compression or averaged vor analytic scoring .",
    "recall the scoring scheme from [ scoring : quarter ] in the introduction .    since compression",
    "does not depend on a distinguished vertex , we need only consider the flat case .",
    "calculation  [ q : gma ] shows that the compression score of any quarter is nonpositive .",
    "averaged vor analytic scoring , applied to an upright quarter , is similarly simple .",
    "calculation  [ q : octavor ] shows that the averaged vor analytic score of any upright quarter is nonpositive .    in these first two calculations ,",

    "the only case remaining is that of a flat quarter , scored by vor analytic .",

    "therefore , we must assume that one of the two faces adjacent to the diagonal has circumradius not less than @xmath27 .",
    "this constraint complicates the verifications .",
    "we first consider a small cell containing the edge lengths @xmath122 .",

    "we prove in calculation  [ q : partials ] that for a sufficiently small corner cell , the @xmath23 through @xmath123 partials ( the edge lengths corresponding to the short edges ) are negative .    to find the maximum score , we therefore decrease the short edges as much as possible , while not violating the face constraint .",
    "on such a cell , the face constraint of one of the edges is tight , so we may assume that @xmath124 and @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 or else @xmath128 and @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath125 , where @xmath131 is the circumradius of a face with edge lengths @xmath132 .    we represent the desired relation as @xmath133 for @xmath134 . calculation  [ q : corner ] verifies this relation .",
    "second , we prove the desired relation off of the corner cell .",
    "we subdivide this verification into calculation  [ q : off : dimred ] taking advantage of dimension reduction and partial derivative information , and calculation  [ q : off : bdry ] which only considers the boundary ( where the face constraint is tight ) .",
    "there are three verifications required to prove the desired relation on .",
    "first , we prove a relation between dihedral angle and score .",
    "we then show that if the dihedral angle of a tetrahedron in a pentahedral cap exceeds a certain bound , the score of the pentahedral cap must fall below @xmath59 , falling into the purview of lemma  [ lem : pentscorebd ] .",
    "we call such a bound a",

    "we restrict our attention to  whose score exceeds @xmath57 , as per lemma  [ lem : pentscorebd ] .",
    "the first relation has the form @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "calculation  [ qr : dihrel ] provides the verification of this relation .",
    "applying the relation to four  forming part of a pentahedral prism , we find @xmath138 applying the relation @xmath139 and adding @xmath140 to both sides of the first relation , we find @xmath141 the left - hand side represents the score of the pentahedral cap . if the right - hand side does not exceed @xmath59 , we can remove the arrangement from consideration , since it pulls the score of the associated pentahedral prism below @xmath39 , as per lemma  [ lem : pentscorebd ] .",

    "we now present the geometric construction which will imply the simplfication .",
    "we represent the geometry of the truncated voronoi cell associated with one half of a quad cluster in figure  [ fig : decomp1 ] .",
    "we can simplify the representation by extending the wedges to enclose the rogers simplices .",

    "we have added two extra pieces of volume ( per flute ) to our construction .",
    "we call these pieces _",
    "quoins_. we attach each quoin to a rogers simplex .",

    "therefore increasing @xmath95 decreases the volume of the quad cluster , if we hold the solid angle fixed ( by varying the length of another edge of the quad cluster ) .",
    "each half of a quad cluster has two variable edge lengths ( not counting the shared diagonal ) .",
    "we label the variable edge lengths of one half of the quad cluster @xmath23 and @xmath203 .",

    "we wish to establish that increasing the short length reduces the volume of the truncated voronoi cell more than decreasing the longer length increases the volume .      to achieve our reduction ,",
    "we establish a formula for the volume of a quoin .",
    "we then verify that the volume of the quoin associated with the shorter edge is decreasing faster under this perturbation than the volume of the quoin associated with the longer edge is increasing .",

    "the plane forming the left face of the quoin is given by the equation @xmath212 , so the ridge of the quoin is given by the curve @xmath213 , where @xmath214 .",
    "hence the area of a slice parallel to the @xmath10-@xmath215 plane is given by the formula @xmath216 the volume of a quoin is therefore given by the formula @xmath217    we actually only need to compute @xmath208 , which is fortunate , since the explicit formula for @xmath207 is somewhat complicated .",
    "we have @xmath218 but @xmath219 , so @xmath220 so in addition , we only need @xmath221 , @xmath222 so @xmath223 which simplifies to @xmath224 hence @xmath225 which simplifies to @xmath226      holding the solid angle fixed , @xmath203 is an implicit function of @xmath23 .",

    "there are several ways to prove this monotonicity relation .",

    "unfortunately , the resulting polynomial has degree @xmath246 , so the verification is somewhat unwieldy , although easy enough using interval methods .",

    "the coefficient of @xmath86 in @xmath254 is @xmath258 the coefficient of @xmath86 in @xmath255 is @xmath259 both coefficients are positive for @xmath164 and @xmath245 in @xmath260 $ ] .",

    "we now apply the reduction argument .",
    "if we are not careful about how we apply the argument , however , this reduction could introduce some complications .",
    "we begin with a squashed quad cluster with consecutive upper edge lengths @xmath262 and diagonal @xmath161 adjacent to the first two upper edges .",
    "recall that we chose the diagonal of the quad cluster to be the shorter of the two possible diagonals .",
    "we refer to the other possible diagonal as the _ cross - diagonal_. recall that the reduction fixes the length of the diagonal .",
    "if the length of the cross - diagonal does not drop to @xmath5 under the perturbation , we arrive at the configuration with edge lengths @xmath263 with diagonal @xmath161 .",
    "if the length of the cross - diagonal does drop to @xmath5 , then stop the perturbation .",
    "this gives a quadrilateral @xmath264 with diagonal @xmath5 . applying the perturbation to each half independently , we find that the score of each half is maximized by the configuration @xmath265 with diagonal @xmath5 .",
    "we verify the relation for this arrangement in calculation  [ obtuse : vor2 ] .",
    "if the length of the cross - diagonal did not drop to @xmath5 , switch to the cross - diagonal and repeat the process . if the ( new ) cross - diagonal does not drop to @xmath5 , we have arrived at the configuration @xmath266 with diagonal @xmath267 .",
    "choose a new diagonal @xmath268 to be the shorter of the two possible diagonals .",
    "we verify the desired relation for this arrangement in calculation  [ obtuse : vor ] .",
    "finally , we make a few comments about extra constraints in the verifications .    since the score of a quad cluster is non - positive , and @xmath269 where @xmath270 , we need only consider quad clusters for which the solid angle exceeds @xmath271 .",
    "the maximum length of the diagonal is @xmath272 , since otherwise the triangles in the quadrilateral would be obtuse , forcing the cross - diagonal to be shorter than the diagonal .",
    "this would contradict our original choice of the shortest diagonal .    in calculation",
    "[ obtuse : vor ] , we assume that @xmath161 is the shortest diagonal . adding this constraint directly is tedious , since the formula for the cross - diagonal of the quad cluster is somewhat complicated .",
    "we apply a simpler but weaker constraint , that the diagonal @xmath161 of a planar quadrilateral with edge lengths @xmath266 is shorter than @xmath267 , the other planar diagonal .",
    "the constraint @xmath273 gives the constraint @xmath274 .",
    "since the cross - diagonal of the quad cluster is shorter than the cross - diagonal of the planar quadrilateral , this constraint is weaker .      by proposition 4.1 of @xcite ,",
    "the score of a mixed quad cluster is less than @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , we may discard all mixed quad clusters .",
    "the verifications of the relations required in this paper appear intractable using traditional methods .",
    "therefore , we use a relatively new proof technique , interval arithmetic via floating - point computer calculations .",
    "most real numbers are not representable in computer floating - point format .",
    "however , floating - point intervals may be found which contain any real number .",
    "although the magnitude of real numbers representable in fixed - length floating - point format is finite , the format also provides for @xmath275 , which allows for interval containment of all reals .",
    "these intervals may be added , multiplied , etc . , and",
    "the resulting intervals will contain the result of the operation applied to the real numbers which they represent .",
    "since floating - point arithmetic is not exact , interval arithmetic conducted using floating - point arithmetic is not optimal , in the sense that the interval resulting from an operation will usually be larger than the true resultant interval , due to roundoff .",
    "however , barring hardware or software errors ( implementation errors , not roundoff errors ) , floating - point interval arithmetic , unlike floating - point arithmetic , is correct , in the sense that it provides correct interval bounds on the value of a computation , while floating - point arithmetic alone only provides an approximation to the correct value of a computation .",
    "we may therefore use interval arithmetic to prove mathematical results .",
    "floating - point arithmetic alone , in the absence of rigorous error analysis , can not constitute a proof .",
    "we implement floating - point interval arithmetic routines via the ieee 754 standard for floating - point arithmetic @xcite .",
    "implementation of interval arithmetic is straightforward using directed rounding .",
    "in addition to arithmetic functions , we require interval implementations of the square root and arctangent functions . fortunately , the ieee standard provides the square root function .",
    "however , the arctangent function is somewhat problematic , since the standard math libraries do not provide explicit error bounds for their implementations of the arctangent function . in theory",
    ", they should provide an accuracy for the arctangent routine of @xmath276 ulps , meaning that the error is less than one unit in the last place .",
    "i add interval padding of the form @xmath277 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the computed value , and @xmath278 .",
    "this should be sufficient to guarantee proper interval containment , assuming that the library routines are correctly implemented .",
    "armed with standard interval arithmetic and interval arithmetic implementations of _ sqrt _ and _ arctan _ , we can implement interval arithmetic versions of all the special functions required for proving the sphere packing relations .",
    "evaluating these functions on cells , we get bounds",
    ". unfortunately , these bounds are not very good .",
    "the bounds which we get from interval versions of the partial derivative functions are even worse .",
    "this means that cells have to be very small before we can draw conclusions about the signs of the partials .",
    "these bad bounds are due to the inherent nature of interval arithmetic  it produces worst - case results by design .",
    "these bad bounds increase the complexity of the verifications tremendously .",
    "some verifications , using these bounds , require the consideration of billions or trillions of cells , or worse .",
    "therefore , we needed a method for producing better bounds than those which direct interval methods could provide .",
    "the method which we eventually discovered is to use taylor series .",
    "we compute explicit second ( mixed ) partial bounds for the major special functions , and use these bounds to produce very good interval bounds .",
    "these bounds are computed in calculations [ secpar : dih : qr ] through [ secpar : vor ] .",

    "for example , some of the code is specialized to treat only tetrahedra with acute faces , since this allows for some simplifications which improve the efficiency of the routines . with the development of the taylor method",
