    "in our previous paper@xcite , we have provided a more detailed study on a new formulation of hqeft@xcite and applied it to evaluate the weak transition matrix elements between the heavy hadrons containing a single heavy quark .",
    "consequently , the new formulation of hqeft has exhibited interesting features , such as : the luke s theorem comes out automatically without imposing the equation of motion @xmath10 ; the form factors at zero recoil are found to be related to the meson masses , so that the most important relevant form factors at zero recoil can be fitted from the ground state meson masses ; the number of universal form factors up to the order of @xmath11 are less than the one in the usual hqet .",
    "it is of interest to apply the new formulation of hqeft@xcite to the inclusive decays of bottom hadrons .",
    "the inclusive decays of bottom hadrons have been investigated in the recent years by several groups@xmath12 . while it is well known that in the usual hqet there are still some problems which are not yet well understood .",
    "these problems mainly involve the following issues :    firstly , the world average values for the lifetime ratios of bottom hadrons are @xcite    @xmath13    while the usual hqet prediction leads to a uniform lifetime for all the bottom hadrons when the nonspectator effects are neglected .",
    "the lifetime differences emerge from @xmath11 order which is found to be small .",
    "one may expect that the @xmath14 terms become dominant and provide about @xmath15 contribution to the lifetime ratio @xmath16 ( or at least @xmath17 corrections to their total decay rates ) .",
    "if it is the case , the heavy quark expansion seems to fail in the inclusive @xmath18 decays except there are some special reasons to explain why the @xmath14 terms become dorminant and the higher order terms @xmath19 are smaller .",
    "the nonspectator effects have recently been considered in ref.@xcite and found to result in the following predictions    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 characterize the nonfactorization effects .",
    "such a confliction has received wide attention .",
    "authors in refs.@xcite have also discussed the lifetime ratios and came to a similar result . though the prediction for @xmath23 agrees with the current world average , those of @xmath24 and @xmath25 deviate somewhat from the central values of the world average . in the usual hqet , eq.([bs ] ) is the final result because the only difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays lies in the different ckm matrix elements related in the nonspectator effects .    to understand the above problems , one of the attempts is to assume that the local duality may be violated in the nonleptonic inclusive decays .",
    "it was suggested in ref.@xcite that a large @xmath26 order correction in nonleptonic inclusive decays may exist and be simply described by replacing the heavy quark mass by the mass of the decaying hadron in the @xmath27 factor , i.e. , @xmath28    this assumption was further discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "this simple ansatz could not only resolve the lifetime ratio problem , but also provide the correct decay widths for the @xmath9 baryon and the @xmath29 mesons .",
    "but the charm counting may become much larger than the experimental data .",
    "secondly , it seems to have difficulties to simultaneously explain the semileptonic branching ratio @xmath30 and the charm counting @xmath31 in @xmath7 decays . in general ,",
    "when the charm counting is required to be near the experimental data , the predicted semileptonic branching ratio in the usual hqet is significantly larger than the experimental data .",
    "it has been shown in ref.@xcite that for @xmath32 and @xmath33gev    @xmath34    where the first result is for the os scheme and the second one for @xmath35 scheme .",
    "after considering the spectator effects , the results has been found to be improved @xcite    @xmath36    it is seen that the uncertainties in the two quantities are anti - correlated .",
    "one may compare them with the world average@xcite    @xmath37    thirdly , there is an inconsistent picture between the luke s",
    "theorem@xcite for the exclusive heavy hadron decays and the chay - georgi - grinstein theorem@xcite for the inclusive heavy hadron decays .",
    "luke s theorem tells us that the @xmath26 order corrections are absent if one uses the meson mass to normalize the weak matrix elements in the exclusive heavy to heavy transitions at zero recoil .",
    "while according to the chay - georgi - grinstein theorem , @xmath26 order corrections are absent only when the quark mass is used .",
    "consequently , the prediction of total decay width strongly depends on the value of quark mass .",
    "these problems may arise from the simple treatment in the usual hqet , where the bound state effects and hadronization have not been taken into account .",
    "this may be a strong indication for a necessity of developing a new formulation of effective theory to incorporate these effects .",
    "for this purpose , we are going to devote in this paper the investigation of the inclusive bottom hadron decays and to provide better understanding on the problems mentioned above within the framework of the new formulation of hqeft@xcite .",
    "in section ii , we briefly describe the framework of the new formulation of hqeft . in section iii , we apply it to the inclusive bottom hadron decays @xmath38 and present a general formulation for @xmath39 transitions via the heavy quark expansion . in section iv , we investigate the inclusive decays of @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons as well as @xmath9 baryon by providing detailed numerical results for their semileptonic branching ratios and lifetime ratios as well as the charm countings @xmath31 .",
    "it is interesting to see that the results obtained by using the new formulation of hqeft are consistent with the experimental data . in particular",
    ", the new formulation of hqeft allows us to simply clarify the well known ambiguity of using the quark mass or hadron mass in the inclusive heavy hadron decays . as a consequence , the ckm matrix element @xmath2 is well determined from the semileptonic decay rate .",
    "conclusions and remarks are presented in the last section .",
    "for completeness , we present in this section a brief description on the framework of the new formulation of hqeft@xcite .",
    "let us begin with the effective lagrangian for a heavy quark @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are defined as @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes the leading term and @xmath45 represents the terms suppressed by the powers of @xmath26 .",
    "and the representation of left - handed current @xmath46 is @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    in order to exhibit a manifest spin - flavor symmetry in the hqeft , it is useful to introduce a hadron state @xmath50 corresponding to the effective heavy quark field @xmath51 .",
    "the hadron state @xmath50 is related to the state @xmath52 of heavy hadron @xmath53 by the following equation @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the mass of the heavy hadron @xmath53 and @xmath56 .",
    "the factor @xmath55 comes from the standard normalization @xmath57 where the factor @xmath58 is introduced to make the normalization concerning the hadron state @xmath50 to be independent of the heavy flavor , i.e. , @xmath59 with @xmath60    expanding the right - hand side of eq.([hadronmatrix ] ) , to the order of @xmath26 , we have @xmath61    in general , a heavy quark in a hadron can not truly be on - shell due to strong interactions among heavy quark and light quark as well as soft gluons .",
    "the off - shellness of heavy quark in the hadron is characterized by a residual momentum @xmath62 .",
    "the total momentum @xmath63 of the heavy quark in a hadron may be written as : @xmath64 . in the usual hqet one",
    "mainly deals with the heavy quark and treats the light quark as a spectator , which does not affect the properties of heavy hadrons to a large extent ( except the effects of weak annihilation and pauli interference ) .",
    "however , since the light degrees of freedom affect the character of heavy hadrons , it may be this simple treatment that meets difficulties in explaining the lifetime differences between @xmath7 and @xmath8 as well as between @xmath9 and @xmath29 as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "to take the effects of light degrees into account and not to deal with hadronization directly , we will adopt an alternative picture , namely the residual momentum @xmath62 of the heavy quark within a hadron is considered to comprise the contributions of the light degrees of freedom . with this picture the heavy quark may be regarded as a ` dressed heavy quark ' , thus the heavy hadron containing a single heavy quark may be more reliable to be considered as a dualized particle of a ` dressed heavy quark ' . thus the momentum @xmath65 of a hadron @xmath53 is decomposed into @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the momentum depending on the heavy flavor and suppressed by @xmath26 . with this picture ,",
    "the momentum of the ` dressed heavy quark ' inside the hadron is given by @xmath68 hence @xmath69    then @xmath70 and @xmath71    in terms of the operator formulation , it implies that @xmath72 thus to simplify the evaluation of the matrix elements , one may approximately replace the propagator @xmath73 by @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 for pseudo scalar mesons , @xmath77 for vector mesons and @xmath78 for ground state heavy baryons .    with this approximation , the mass formulae can be simply given in terms of the effective lagrangian @xmath45 @xmath79 which can be reexpressed as follows by using eq.([lambda ] ) @xmath80 it is useful to define the mass of ` dressed heavy quark ' as @xmath81 which can be expressed in terms of the hadron mass @xmath82",
    "the techniques for inclusive decays of heavy hadrons in the framework of effective theory was developed in the early years of this decade . here",
    "we shall extend the method of ref.@xcite to the framework of new formulation of hqeft .",
    "let us first briefly recall the basic formulae for the description of inclusive semileptonic decay @xmath83 which is mediated by the effective hamiltonian @xmath84    to calculate the decay rates , it is useful to introduce the hadronic tensor @xmath85 which can be expanded in terms of five form factors when one averages the spin of initial and final states @xmath86    for massless lepton pair , @xmath87 and @xmath88 will not contribute to the decay width @xmath89    to evaluate the form factors @xmath90 , let us consider the time ordered product @xmath91 it is known that the form factors @xmath90 are related to @xmath92 via @xmath93    explicitly , the quark matrix element in eq.([tmunu ] ) is given by @xmath94 here @xmath95 is the momentum of charm quark .    within the framework of new formulation of hqeft ,",
    "as we have discussed above , the residual momentum of the bottom quark in the hadron is given by @xmath96 .",
    "for ensuring the leading term to have the largest contribution , we may expand eq.([qm ] ) in terms of the small subtracted momentum @xmath97 here @xmath98    to evaluate the matrix element eq.([qm ] ) , we need to know the following relevant matrix elements    @xmath99    up to the leading order in @xmath0",
    ", we have , from eqs.([motion ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) , the following results for @xmath100 and @xmath101    @xmath102    the matrix element concerning one gluon in eq.([tmunu ] ) has the form @xmath103 ^ 2 } \\gamma^\\tau b |h > .   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    expanding eqs.([qm ] ) and ( [ gm ] ) , one can extract the form factors @xmath92 . using the relation eq.([tiwi ] ) , one then obtains @xmath90 . here",
    "we shall only list the final results for @xmath90    [ wi ] @xmath104    with @xmath105 .    substituting eq.([wi ] ) into eq.([qxy ] ) and integrating out the variables @xmath106 and @xmath107 , one yields the inclusive lepton spectrum @xmath108 with @xmath109    where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are rescaled variables defined as @xmath112    the kinetic region for @xmath110 is @xmath113 treating charm quark @xmath114 as heavy quark and using @xmath115 , one has @xmath116 thus the total decay width for @xmath117 is found to be @xmath118    similarly , we find that @xmath119 transitions have the following general forms    @xmath120    with @xmath121 and @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the @xmath124 functions arise from qcd radiative corrections .",

    "secondly , paralleling to luke s theorem , there is no @xmath0 order correction when the hadron mass is used .",
    "thus the uncertain parameters , i.e. , the bottom quark mass @xmath133 and binding energy @xmath135 , do not enter separately into the expression of decay widths . furthermore , one may notice that for the final charm quark , both charm quark mass @xmath136 and ` dressed charm quark ' mass @xmath137 have entered into the phace space factors of the general formulation of the decay rates . where the quark mass @xmath136 comes from the propagator of charm quark , and the ` dressed charm quark ' mass @xmath137 arises from the momentum of charm quark inside the hadron , i.e. , @xmath138 , for a parallel treatment to the bottom quark inside the hadron .",
    "these features enable us to determine the lifetime ratios , semileptonic branching ratios and even the lifetimes of bottom hadrons in rather accuracy .",
    "in our numerical calculations , we shall neglect the contributions from penguin diagrams and other rare decays and incorporate the two - loop radiative corrections in refs.@xcite to calculate the values of observable parameters in @xmath18 decays .",
    "such an approximation causes errors no more than 2% .",
    "thus the total decay width for bottom hadrons are given by @xmath139 the semileptonic branching ratios are defined as @xmath140 @xmath141 other two ratios concerning the charm counting @xmath142 and relative leptonic contributions between the @xmath5 decay @xmath143 and the @xmath6 decay @xmath144    @xmath145    note that the formula given above are general and can be applied to bottom hadrons by just taking different binding energies @xmath146 for different bottom hadrons .",
    "we now discuss these observable quantities in detail below .",
    "the basic parameters involved are @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 . using eq.([massl1l2 ] ) and",
    "the measured masses of the ground state heavy mesons and heavy baryons , one can find that @xmath149 in the heavy baryon system is almost the same as the one in the heavy meson system .",
    "thus besides the known masses@xcite @xmath151 there are only four parameters @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 in our calculations . here",
    "@xmath149 could be computed by qcd sum rules@xcite or other phenomenological model@xcite .",
    "it may also be extracted from fitting the meson spectra .",
    "nevertheless , all the results remain suffering from large uncertainties . here",
    "we shall use the most conservative range @xmath152 for @xmath150 , the value extracted from the known @xmath153 mass splitting is quite stable @xmath154 which is accurate up to power correction of @xmath155 .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath147 arising from the propagator in eqs.([qm ] ) and ( [ gm ] ) shall be taken as an effective pole mass .",
    "its value has a large range@xcite @xmath156 note that @xmath157 is different from the ` heavy quark mass ' in the lagrangian eq.([leff ] ) and the ` dressed heavy quark ' mass in eq.([addmass ] ) . in the numerical calculations",
    ", we will restrict its range to be @xmath158      it is seen that , in the framework of new formulation of hqeft , only ` dressed bottom quark ' mass @xmath159 enters into the decay rate , but both charm quark mass @xmath147 and ` dressed charm quark ' mass @xmath160 appear in the phase space factors at tree level .",
    "so the lifetime ratio is not merely given by the ratio @xmath161 ^ 5/[m_b+\\bar{\\lambda}(h^\\prime)]^5 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath148 , @xmath147 and @xmath149 dependences of the lifetime ratios @xmath3 and @xmath4 are plotted in fig .",

    "the ratios as functions of @xmath147 and @xmath162 also exhibit some minimal points around which they change slowly .",
    "when taking @xmath163 and @xmath164 , we have    @xmath165    which show a good agreement with the experimental data@xcite .",

    ", @xmath31 is not sensitive to @xmath148 , but it strongly depends on @xmath147 and @xmath162 .",
    "the uncertainty in the theoretical prediction mainly arises from that of the value @xmath147 as shown in fig .",

    ", one has @xmath185 .    from figs . 2 - 5",
    ", one can see that there exists a common region for parameters @xmath148 , @xmath147 and @xmath149 , so that all the quantities @xmath30 , @xmath167 , @xmath171 and @xmath31 are consistent with experimental data .",
    "when taking the following interesting region for the parameters @xmath186 and normalizing @xmath187 and @xmath188 , we have @xmath189 which is consistent with the world average value .",
    "note that a larger @xmath147 value leads to a lower @xmath171 and @xmath31 but to a larger @xmath30 and @xmath167 .    in the usual hqet ,",
    "up to @xmath11 order and neglecting the ` spectator effect ' , however , there does not exist a common region for any choice of parameters , which makes all the quantities to be consistent with the experimental data .",
    "this can been explicitly seen from fig .",
    ", where we have plotted four quantities @xmath30 , @xmath167 , @xmath171 and @xmath31 as the functions of the running energy scale @xmath148 and the mass ratio @xmath190 with @xmath191 ( note that in the usual hqet , the @xmath18 quark mass @xmath133 , instead of the ` dressed heavy quark ' mass @xmath159 , is the basic parameter ) .",
    "it is clear from fig . 6",
    "that there are two obstacles in the usual hqet to obtain a consistent fit .",
    "firstly , a lower @xmath31 value requires a larger mass ratio @xmath192 and scale @xmath148 , while a higher scale will lead semileptonic branching ratio to be larger than the experimental bound , and a higher mass ratio will result in a lower value @xmath171 .",
    "we now discuss more about @xmath8 and @xmath9 decay . in the usual hqet ,",
    "all the above observable quantities in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 decays get the same results up to @xmath193 order .",
    "this is because the semileptonic decay rates of all the bottom hadrons are the same , thus the usual hqet leads to the following predictions up to @xmath193 order    @xmath194    in the usual hqet , the lifetime ratio problems are expected to be solved through the non - leptonic decays .",
    "if it is the case , one should have the following consequences for the ratios of the semileptonic branching ratios    [ uhqet ] @xmath195    for the ratio @xmath171 one has @xmath196 one may compare it with the current experimental data@xcite    @xmath197    in the framework of new formulation of hqeft , as we have discussed in the previous sections , the picture for heavy hadron containing a single heavy quark is such that the heavy quark in the hadron is off - shell , its off - shellness is characterized by the binding energy @xmath135 .",
    "consequently , the so - called ` dressed heavy quark ' masses @xmath159 and @xmath160 enter into the phase space factors . for @xmath8 and @xmath9 decays , the differences of the phase space factors already appear at tree level .",
    "it is not difficult to obtain the following relations    [ hqeft ] @xmath198    compared eqs.([uhqet ] ) and eq.([r ] ) with eq.([hqeft ] ) , one may find the significant difference between the usual hqet and the new formulation .",
    "the more and more accurate experiments in the future will provide results of @xmath199 and @xmath171 to test the usual hqet and the new formulation of hqeft .",
    "when normalizing @xmath200 to @xmath201 and @xmath202 to @xmath203 , we have    @xmath204      one of the most important applications is the determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath2 . from eq.([sl ] ) the semileptonic decay rate is given by @xmath205 where the ellipse denotes higher order perturbative and non - perturbative corrections .",
    "it is explicitly seen that only the combination of @xmath135 and @xmath133 , i.e. , @xmath159 , appears in the above equation and there is no @xmath0 corrections . at the same time , the @xmath0 power corrections to the decay width @xmath206 is as small as @xmath207 .",
    "thus all the parameters in eq.([vsl ] ) have clear physical meaning and the higher power corrections can be ignored .",
    "this allows us to extract @xmath2 from fitting the experimental data .",
    "the value of @xmath2 as function of @xmath147 and @xmath148 is shown in fig .",
    "it is easy to find that the value of @xmath2 has only a weak dependence on the energy scale @xmath148 and the charm quark mass @xmath147 and @xmath162 cause the main uncertainties for the prediction .",
    "there exist maximal points around which its variation as the function of @xmath147 and @xmath162 becomes slow .",
    "the values of @xmath2 around those points should be more reliable .",
    "it is interesting to note that once one normalizes the semileptonic branching ratio to the experimental data , @xmath2 exhibits an interesting correlation with the ratio @xmath171 .",
    "its relation is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that the value of @xmath2 increases linearly as @xmath171 decreases . including two - loop qcd corrections and fitting @xmath208 to the measured data , we obtain @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "the experimental uncertainty comes from the errors of @xmath7 lifetime .",
    "one may compare the above prediction for @xmath2 in the new formulation of hqeft with the one in the usual hqet which is plotted in fig .",
    "we have presented , within the framework of new formulation of hqeft , a general formulation for the inclusive decays of bottom hadrons via the heavy quark expansion .",
    "such a general formulation has exhibited interesting features : the @xmath211 corrections are absent and the mass preliminarily entered into the general formulation is neither the bottom quark mass @xmath133 nor heavy hadron mass @xmath212 , it is the so - called ` dressed bottom quark ' mass @xmath213 that is actually the heavy hadron mass in the infinite quark mass limit , i.e. , @xmath214 $ ] . consequently , the decay rates of the bottom hadrons can be reexpressed in terms of the bottom hadron mass with the @xmath211 corrections remaining absent .",
    "this feature is now consistent with the expectation from luke s theorem , since according to that theorem the sum of all the channels of exclusive @xmath18 decays is free from the @xmath0 order corrections at zero recoil .",
    "such a feature distinguishes from the one obtained by chay - georgi - grinstein theorem within the framework of the usual hqet .",
    "the reason is that in the new formulation of hqeft , luke s theorem comes out automatically without the need of imposing the equation of motion @xmath215 . as a consequence , not only the lifetime ratio @xmath4 but",
    "also the ratio @xmath3 is in good agreement with the experimental data . at the same time , the results for the inclusive semileptonic branching ratio @xmath30 , the ratio @xmath171 and the charm counting @xmath31 are also consistent with the experimental data .",
    "in particular , the ckm matrix element @xmath2 has been nicely extracted from the inclusive semileptonic decay rate , and the result well agrees with the one from the exclusive decays@xcite . for @xmath216 and @xmath217 , we have    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } { \\tau(b^0_s ) \\over \\tau(b^0 ) } = 0.95 ; & & \\quad     { \\tau(\\lambda_b ) \\over \\tau(b^0 ) } = 0.77,\\\\ b_{sl}(b^0_s ) = 10.82\\% ; & & \\quad b_{sl}(\\lambda_b ) = 11.32\\%,\\\\ r(b^0 ) = 0.25 ; & \\quad r(b^0_s ) = 0.27 ; & \\quad r(\\lambda_b ) = 0.32,\\\\ n_c(b^0 ) = 1.19 ; & \\quad n_c(b^0_s ) = 1.17 ; & \\quad n_c(\\lambda_b ) = 1.13 , \\\\     if the nonspectator effects are taken into account , the charm counting will decrease further@xcite .",
    "it is expected that more precise data for the @xmath7 decays and further test for the predictions on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems will provide a useful check for the framework of new formulation of hqeft at the level of higher order corrections .",
