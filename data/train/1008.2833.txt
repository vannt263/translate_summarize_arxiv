    "it is of great interest to find lattice formulations of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with exact chiral symmetry . in such a formulation ,",
    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the associated spectrum of goldstone bosons ( i.e. the light mesons ) , as well as the emergence of the flavor - singlet ( @xmath0 meson ) mass via the index theorem connection between quark zero - modes and gauge field topology @xcite , can be studied directly in the lattice model without the usual need to extrapolate via chiral perturbation theory .",
    "finding such formulations is problematic though @xcite , and was a long - standing challenge in lattice qcd .",
    "an explicit formulation of this kind was finally found by neuberger @xcite via the overlap formulation of chiral fermions on the lattice @xcite .",
    "it is a chirally improved version of wilson fermions , and realizes exact chiral symmetry of the ginsparg - wilson ( gw ) type @xcite .",
    "however , its theoretical attractiveness is offset in practice by the high computational cost of implementing it in simulations .    in this paper , building on insights from @xcite , a new version of overlap fermions is presented constructed from the staggered lattice fermion rather than the previously used wilson fermion .",
    "the staggered fermion is the most computationally efficient lattice fermion formulation known , and this advantage is expected to be inherited by the new staggered version of overlap fermions . the challenge in doing this is that the overlap construction relies on specific properties of wilson fermions that are not shared by staggered fermions .",
    "this challenge is overcome here using a new theoretical idea of interest in its own right : a wilson - like phase of the staggered fermion theory can be created by adding a certain `` flavored '' mass term . in this new phase , the number of quark flavors described by the staggered fermion is reduced from four to two , and the staggered fermion acquires wilson - like properties . the latter allow the overlap construction to work as desired .",
    "the resulting staggered overlap fermion describes two quark flavors and has an exact _ unflavored _ gw chiral symmetry originating from the exact flavored chiral symmetry of the original staggered fermion .",
    "however , the _ flavored _ vector and chiral symmetries of the quark pair described by the staggered overlap fermion are not exact since the corresponding symmetries of the original staggered fermion are broken by lattice effects . therefore , exact flavored vector and chiral symmetries only hold for _ pairs _ of quark flavors when each pair is described by a staggered overlap fermion .    the two quark flavors described by the staggered overlap fermion can be taken as the almost massless @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks in qcd .",
    "then , due to the exact unflavored gw chiral symmetry , this description has all the advantages of the usual overlap fermions regarding the axial u(1 ) anomaly and index theorem connection between quark zero - modes and gauge field topology .",
    "this is connected with some of the most subtle and interesting parts of qcd physics  not only the @xmath0 mass mentioned already but also the order of the qcd phase transition at finite temperature  which are also computationally highly demanding to study in lattice qcd ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . finding a new lattice approach in which these features are not distorted by lattice effects , and which is computationally more efficient than usual overlap fermions , is therefore significant . as an indication of the desirability of this",
    ", it can be noted that high - precision calculation of the @xmath0 mass is still an outstanding problem in lattice qcd  the latest state of the art calculation , using wilson - based domain wall fermions ( a truncated version of usual overlap fermions ) , has an uncertainly of 15% @xcite .",
    "the staggered lattice fermion field is a one component grassmann field @xmath3 , @xmath4 , describing 4 degenerate dirac fermions .",
    "the staggered dirac operator acting on these fields is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with the parallel transporters @xmath8 given in terms of the lattice link variables @xmath9 by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "there is an exact _ flavored _ chiral symmetry \\{_55,d_st}=0 [ 3 ] where @xmath12 , given by @xmath13 , corresponds to @xmath14 in the spin - flavor interpretation of staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "the first and second @xmath15 factors act in spinor and flavor space , respectively .",
    "note the properties @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "direct application of the overlap construction @xcite to staggered fermions by simply replacing the kernel operator @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the wilson - dirac operator ) by @xmath20 does not give anything useful : the exact flavored chiral symmetry of the staggered fermion is lost , there is no gw symmetry to replace it , and there are no exact zero - modes in general .",
    "however , as we will now show , the situation changes if , instead of a scalar mass @xmath21 , we use the following `` flavor - chiral '' mass term : m_st=_55_5,r>0 [ 5 ] here @xmath22 is the staggered fermion version of the chirality matrix , corresponding to @xmath23 up to @xmath24 discretization errors in the spin - flavor interpretation @xcite .",
    "consequently , in the spin - flavor interpretation , m_st  ~  * 1*_5+o(a ) .",
    "[ 8 ] explicitly , @xmath22 is given as follows .",
    "use the parallel transporters to define @xmath25 , and let @xmath26 denote the symmetrized product of @xmath27",
    ". then @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "( explicitly , @xmath30 . )",
    "note that @xmath22 is hermitian and commutes with @xmath12 ; therefore @xmath31 is hermitian .",
    "the effect of this mass term in d_st - m_st [ 9 ] is to split the low - lying modes into branches with approximately definite positive and negative flavor - chirality , giving them masses @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "this is shown in the free field case in fig .  1 , taken from @xcite .     spectrum of @xmath34 in the free field case @xcite.,width=124 ]    in this case",
    ", there are 16 zero - modes of @xmath35 with momenta @xmath36 , @xmath37 . on the vectorspace @xmath38 spanned by these modes we have @xmath39 , so there is a decomposition @xmath40 with @xmath41 on @xmath42 , and it can be shown that @xmath43 . hence @xmath44 on @xmath42 ; this shows how the real eigenvalues arise in the free field case . moreover , the operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 making up @xmath35 coincide on @xmath38 and can be shown to commute with @xmath47 on @xmath38 .",
    "hence their representations @xmath48 on @xmath38 ( given in @xcite by the @xmath49 matrices @xmath50 ) , which form a representation of the euclidean dirac algebra @xcite , decompose into representations @xmath51 on @xmath42 . from this it can be seen that , from a low momentum viewpoint , the 4 dirac fermion species described by the staggered fermion are split into two pairs of dirac fermions , with the pair with positive ( negative ) flavor - chirality having mass @xmath32 ( @xmath52 ) .    upon inserting the kernel @xmath34 into the overlap formula , d_so&=&(1+(d_st - m_st ) ) ,",
    "+ & & [ 10 ] the negative mass modes are converted into the physical modes of a massless fermion , while the positive mass modes are converted into modes with heavy masses @xmath53 which decouple in the continuum limit , just as in the wilson case .",
    "thus only two of the original four quark flavors survive in the resulting overlap fermion . furthermore , since the physical modes have approximately definite positive flavor - chirality , @xmath54 on these modes up to @xmath24 effects .",
    "the staggered overlap dirac operator ( [ 10 ] ) satisfies the following gw relation : \\{_55,d_so}=d_so_55d_so [ 11 ] note that this is now an _",
    "unflavored _ chiral symmetry , since , as remarked , @xmath55 on the physical modes of the staggered overlap fermion .",
    "the gw relation can be readily verified after noting that the staggered overlap operator can be expressed as d_so&=&(1+_55 ) [ 12 ] with the hermitian operator @xmath56 given by h_st=_55(d_st - m_st)=_55d_st-_5 [ 13 ] it also follows from ( [ 12 ] ) that @xmath57 , which implies that the non - real eigenvalues of @xmath58 come in complex conjugate pairs . since the only possible real eigenvalues ( which must lie on the gw circle ) are @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ", it follows that the fermion determinant @xmath61 is real and non - negative , as required for lattice qcd simulations .",
    "a required property of the lattice dirac operator is locality .",
    "it holds for @xmath58 ; this can be proved analytically by the same argument as in the wilson overlap case @xcite , using the staggered bound mentioned in @xcite , when the lattice gauge fields satisfy an admissibility condition ; the details are in @xcite .",
    "locality of @xmath58 in realistic gauge field backgrounds has been shown numerically in @xcite .    computational efficiency of @xmath58",
    "was also studied in @xcite : preliminary numerical evidence indicates a speedup of order 2 - 3 compared to the wilson - based overlap dirac operator in realistic gauge field backgrounds .",
    "we now verify that @xmath58 has pairs of exact chiral zero modes with index determined by gauge field topology in accordance with the 2-flavor index theorem when the lattice gauge field background is not too rough .",
    "due to the gw relation ( [ 11 ] ) , the index is well - defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of independent zero - modes of @xmath58 with @xmath64 chirality under @xmath12 ( which is the same as @xmath22 on these modes up to @xmath24 effects ) .",
    "a general formula @xcite gives ( d_so)=- ( ) .",
    "[ 16 ] we connect this to the hermitian staggered operator studied previously in @xcite , denoted by @xmath65 below :    * theorem . * _ for every value of @xmath66 , the hermitian staggered operators _ h_st(m)=_55d_st - m_5  ,   _ st(m)=id_st - m_5    the proof of the theorem is deferred to @xcite .",
    "it can be understood intuitively from the fact that @xmath67 arises from @xmath68 by a change of representation of the staggered sign factors @xmath69 in @xmath35 .    in light of the theorem we can replace @xmath56 in ( [ 16 ] ) by @xmath67 with @xmath70",
    "; here @xmath71 is the parameter in ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "but then the results of @xcite give ( d_so)=(d_st)=2q [ 18 ] in sufficiently smooth gauge field backgrounds of topological charge @xmath72 and with @xmath33 lying in a suitable range .",
    "the last equality in ( [ 18 ] ) was confirmed in the numerical study in @xcite .",
    "it is important to consider the symmetries of the staggered overlap fermion since these need to be sufficient for renormalizability and stability of the massless 2-flavor phase under radiative corrections . besides the replacement of the flavored chiral symmetry ( [ 3 ] ) by the gw symmetry ( [ 11 ] ) ,",
    "the usual staggered fermion symmetries listed in @xcite all hold for the staggered overlap fermion , except for axis reversals and shift transformations . under the latter @xmath73 , and",
    "therefore @xmath74 is invariant when these transformations are combined with the parameter flip @xmath75 in ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the same invariances must hold for all counterterms that arise . hence the counterterms must be invariant under all the usual staggered fermion symmetries except ( [ 3 ] ) , and except for a possible sign change under axis reversals and shift transformations .",
    "it is easy to show @xcite that the most general _ local _ mass - dimension 4 terms with these properties are ( up to proportionality , and modulo @xmath76 terms ) and @xmath35 commute and the second term in ( [ 18a ] ) simplifies . ]",
    "local , all counterterms are also local , and the theory is renormalizable , provided the power - counting theorem holds @xcite .",
    "it holds in the wilson overlap case @xcite and is plausible in the present case . assuming this , stability can be established to all orders in the loop expansion as follows . the gw relation ( [ 11 ] ) leads to _",
    "55d_so^-1(q)+d_so^-1(q)_55 = _ 55 [ 18b ] where @xmath77 with @xmath78 being the fermion self - energy . here and in the following",
    ", @xmath79 denotes the free field momentum representation of the staggered operator @xmath80 ; it is a linear map ( @xmath49 matrix ) @xmath81 on the zero - mode vector space @xmath38 defined earlier , with @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "the momentum representation of @xmath12 is a constant matrix , and @xmath83 on @xmath42 where @xmath84 .    in light of the preceding , at one loop",
    "@xmath78 has the form c_1d_st(q)+c_2_55_5(q)d_st(q ) + _ 55_5(q)+ [ 18c ] up to irrelevant terms , with each @xmath85 diverging no worse than logarithmically for @xmath86 .",
    "note that all terms in ( [ 18c ] ) map @xmath42 to itself , as does @xmath87 . from ( [ 18b])([18c ] ) and",
    "the fact that @xmath88 on @xmath89 it is straightforward to show @xmath90 on @xmath89 .",
    "( we omit the details ; an analogous result was found in the wilson overlap case in @xcite ) .",
    "this implies @xmath91 in ( [ 18c ] ) , so on @xmath89 the last two terms in ( [ 18c ] ) combine to give an irrelevant term @xmath92 which vanishes @xmath93 for @xmath86 .",
    "the first two terms in ( [ 18c ] ) act on @xmath42 as @xmath94 .",
    "it follows that , for @xmath86 , @xmath95 on @xmath89 . the self - energy is hereby seen to have the usual effect of a logarithmically divergent wave function renormalization on the massless physical modes .",
    "then , after renormalizing the theory at one loop , the argument above can be repeated to get the same result at two loops , and so on . in this way stability",
    "is seen to hold to all orders in the renormalized theory .",
    "a deeper understanding of the staggered overlap construction can be obtained by clarifying the wilson - like nature of its staggered fermion kernel . to this end",
    "we introduce the following 2-flavor wilson - like version of the staggered dirac operator : d_sw = d_st+w_st , w_st=(1-_55_5 ) . [ 19 ] the term @xmath96 plays an analogous role to the wilson term in the wilson - dirac operator : it decouples the negative flavor - chirality modes by giving them mass @xmath60 while keeping the two positive flavor - chirality modes as the physical modes .",
    "hence @xmath97 describes two physical quark flavors on which @xmath98 up to @xmath76 effects . in light of this",
    "we can obtain a 2-flavor overlap fermion by taking @xmath99 with @xmath100 , @xmath101 as the kernel in the usual overlap construction . for @xmath102",
    "this is precisely the 2-flavor staggered overlap dirac operator @xmath58 we constructed above in ( [ 10 ] ) , since @xmath103 but now we see that it can be generalized to any @xmath101 . furthermore , the role of the parameter @xmath71 in the staggered overlap construction is hereby clarified : it is analogous to the wilson parameter in the usual overlap construction based on wilson fermions .",
    "this is surprising , since @xmath104 in ( [ 5 ] ) initially appears to be analogous to the mass parameter @xmath105 in the wilson case .",
    "starting from wilson fermions , a domain wall fermion formulation can be constructed @xcite which gives a truncation of the overlap fermion construction @xcite . the same can now be done with staggered fermions simply by replacing d_wd_sw,_5_55 [ 26 ] in the previous wilson - based constructions .",
    "the lattice dirac operator for the staggered domain wall fermion in 5 dimensions is then d_sdw = d_sw - m+_55_s  , m=  ,  ( 0,2 ) [ 27 ] where @xmath106 $ ] is the lattice coordinate of the 5th dimension and @xmath107 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 being the forward and backward finite difference operators .",
    "boundary conditions on @xmath111 at @xmath112 and @xmath113 are introduced analogously to the wilson - based case ; then the staggered domain wall construction is seen to be a truncation of the staggered overlap construction by essentially the same argument as in @xcite .",
    "the details will be given in @xcite .",
    "underlying the staggered overlap and staggered domain wall fermion constructions in this paper is a staggered version of wilson fermions obtained by adding a flavored mass term to the staggered fermion action .",
    "the idea of considering staggered fermion with flavored mass term is not new in itself ; this was already done many years ago by golterman and smit in @xcite .",
    "rather , the new idea here is that , for a certain choice of flavored mass term , namely the wilson term @xmath96 in ( [ 19 ] ) determined by the `` flavor - chiral '' mass term @xmath31 in ( [ 5 ] ) , one can use the staggered operator @xmath12 for the role of @xmath15 since it coincides with @xmath23 on the 2 physical flavors up to @xmath76 effects .",
    "the significance of this is that the properties @xmath114 and @xmath115hermiticity , which are crucial in the usual overlap and domain wall constructions , continue to hold in the staggered setting with @xmath116 . this would not be true if one tried to use the direct staggered analogue @xmath22 of @xmath15 .",
    "the flavor - chiral mass term used in this work , which reduces the 4 staggered fermion flavors to 2 flavors , is not the only possibility .",
    "another flavor - chiral mass term which reduces the number of flavors to 1 was subsequently proposed in @xcite after the first version of this paper appeared on the arxiv .",
    "however , it breaks more of the staggered fermion symmetries than the present proposal , namely some of the lattice rotation symmetries .",
    "the consequences of this for radiatively generated counter - terms and fine - tuning requirements remains to be seen .",
    "the 1-flavor version of staggered overlap fermions has the advantage that all the _ flavored _ vector and gw - chiral symmetries are exact . on the other hand , for problems where",
    "only the _ unflavored _ chiral symmetry is important , e.g. for computing the @xmath0 mass , the present 2-flavor formulation has advantages : it preserves lattice rotation symmetry and gives `` two quarks ( the @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) for the price of one '' in lattice qcd simulations .",
