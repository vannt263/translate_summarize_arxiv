    "her x-1 is a stellar binary system consisting of a neutron star and a a / f secondary star .",
    "it has been extensively studied at many wavelengths .",
    "its main temporal observational characteristics are : the spin period of the neutron star is @xmath01.24 sec , the binary orbital period is 1.7 day and there is a 35 day period seen in x - rays which has been interpreted as due to a warped accretion disc precessing around the neutron star .",
    "we have obtained three observations of her x-1 made using _ xmm - newton _ at 3 different epochs . in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of spin resolved data obtained using the epic detectors .",
    "the details of our observations are summarized in table  [ obslog ] . to determine how these epochs relate to the 35  d precession period ( @xmath1 )",
    ", we extracted the _ rxte asm _ ( 2 - 10 )  kev quick - look light curve ( figure  [ gramsay - c1_fig1 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the first observation took place close to maximum x - ray brightness ( ` main - on ' ) , while the third was close to the secondary maximum ( ` short - on ' ) .",
    "the second observation took place after the end of the main - on state ( ` faint - state ' ) .",
    "the epic detectors were configured in timing mode ( apart from mos2 which was in full frame mode and heavily piled - up ) . in the second observation ,",
    "data at the start and end of the observation were excluded because of a higher particle background .",
    "because of difficulties in extracting background light curves and spectra in timing mode , our data are not background subtracted .",
    "since her x-1 is much brighter than the background in each epoch , we do not expect that this will have a significant effect on our results .",
    "we have analysed both epic mos1 and epic pn data .",
    "the results from each detector are consistent and here we show the results based on the pn data .",
    "data were processed using version 5.2 of the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system .",
    ".summary of the _ xmm - newton _ observations of her x-1 . for the orbital phasing we use the ephemeris of still et al ( 2001 ) ; for the 35  day phasing we define phase 0.0 as point of the main high state turn - on .",

    "a barycentric correction and a correction for the motion of the neutron star around the binary center of mass ( using the ephemeris of @xcite ) was applied to each photon .",
    "we then used a discrete fourier transform to obtain the spin period in each of the 3 epochs . because of the problems with the clock on - board _ xmm - newton _ these periods differ to some extent from that expected from the recent spin history of this object ( eg @xcite ) . since this study is concerned with the relative phasing of the different energies rather than the precise spin period , we are confident that since we have used the most prominent peak in the power spectra our results are robust .",
    "( 6,12 ) ( -2.5,-1.5 )    we show in figure [ gramsay_c1-fig2 ] the energy - resolved spin - folded light curves in our 3 observations . in the main - on state ( @xmath1=0.17 ) the softest ( 0.30.7 kev ) and the harder ( @xmath22 kev ) light curves",
    "are anti - phased with some evidence that the minimum of the continuum subtracted 6.156.7 kev light curve matches the peak of the harder curves . in the faint - state ( @xmath1=0.26 ) the modulation",
    "is much reduced , being greatest above 7 kev .",
    "the soft and hard curves are approximately in phase . by the short - on state ( @xmath1=0.60 )",
    "we find that the peak of the hard light curves corresponds to the minimum of the softest .    to investigate this more fully , we show the cross correlation of the soft and hard light curves in figure [ gramsay_c1-fig3 ] .",
    "in the main - on state we find that the most prominent cross correlation peak shows that the soft and the hard light curves are strongly anti - correlated , with only a small phase lag ( @xmath3 or 330@xmath4 ) .",
    "we also find another ( positive ) peak at ( @xmath5 ) which corresponds approximately to the separation between the peaks in the soft and hard light curves .",
    "the faint state shows a positive correlation at small phase lag ( @xmath6 ) and a negative correlation at @xmath7 . during the short - on state ,",
    "we find the highest correlation near @xmath8 .",
    "it is clear that the relative phase shift between the soft and hard x - ray light curves varies as a function of the 35  d precession period .",
    "( 8,5 ) ( -0.5,-0.5 )",
    "to search for a variation in the profile of the fe line at 6.4  kev over the spin cycle , we extracted spin resolved spectra .",
    "we ignored energies less than 5 kev and more than 8 kev and used a gaussian plus power law model to model the spectra .",
    "we also determined the variation in the power law normalisation by fitting an absorbed power law over the range ( 2.0 - 6.1 )  kev and ( 6.7 - 10 )  kev , after fixing the slope to be that of the best fit of the appropriate integrated spectrum .",
    "results are shown in figure [ gramsay_c1-fig4 ] , together with the soft and hard light curves .    at @xmath1=0.26",
    "there is no significant variation in the line parameters . at phase @xmath1=0.60",
    "there is marginal evidence that the minimum of the equivalent width corresponds to the maximum of the intensity in the ( 2 - 4 )  kev band . at @xmath1=0.17",
    "there is some evidence that the line width reaches a minimum at the maximum of the intensity of the ( 2 - 4 )  kev light curve , but the most interesting result is that the the equivalent width curve clearly follow the soft x - ray light curve .",
    "this supports the idea that the 6.4  kev fluorescence fe line and the black body component originate from a common region .",
    "( 14,10 ) ( -2.5,-7.5 )",
    "many features of the light curves are naturally explained within the scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the obscuration of a multi - component x - ray beam by a counter - precessing , tilted , twisted disk . for simplicity",
    ", the x - ray beam is assumed to be decoupled from the disk and is axisymmetric .",
    "one of the main features of this model is that it ascribes the variations observed in the pulse profile over the 35  day cycle to occultation from the _ inner _ part of the disk , whereas most of the previous investigations have assumed an occultation from the _ outer _ boundary .",
    "the overall situation is summarized in the bottom panel of figure 8 in @xcite , while their figures 10 & 11 illustrate the evolution of the pulse profiles predicted during the main - on and short - on respectively .",
    "there is a similarity between the multi - peaked hard light curve at @xmath9 and the model during the progressive occultation of leading and trailing peaks of the hard beam . at @xmath10 ,",
    "when the main components are occulted , we only observe the survival of a broad , underlying modulation that is attributed to the magneto - spheric emission .",
    "since this component is emitted from a larger region at some distance from the neutron star , it is naturally expected to have a lower modulation as well as a broad maximum .",
    "the pulse profile close to the short - on is also similar to that presented by @xcite at @xmath11 ( see their figure  11 ) . in the epic data",
    ", we can in fact recognize a main peak `` a '' as well a small peak `` b '' ( figure  [ gramsay_c1-fig2 ] ) .",
    "however , because the notch `` b '' is the hardest feature , spectral considerations suggest that this maximum is associated with the small hard peak and the feature `` a '' with the soft peak discussed by @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , `` b '' is actually due to direct emission from the pencil beam , while `` a '' is the radiation redirected into the fan beam from the antipodal accretion column .      given the complexity of the source , pulse - phase spectroscopy is of paramount importance to separate the different spectral components observed in her x-1 .",
    "using @xmath12 and @xmath13 data it has been shown that , during the main - on state , the maximum of the thermal component and the power law components are shifted by @xmath14 .",
    "the situation is less consistent as far as the 6.4  kev fe k line is concerned : @xcite have shown that its intensity is modulated in phase with the soft emission , suggesting a common origin while @xcite have found it correlated with the hard ( power law ) emission .    the shift in phase between the hard and soft emission can be explained if the latter results from re - processing of hard x - rays in the inner part of the accretion disk . if a non - tilted disk intercepts ( and re - processes ) a substantial fraction of the hard beam from the neutron star , the expected phase difference between direct and reflected component is @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the value determined using @xmath12 and @xmath13 data has been associated with the disk having a tilt angle . if the tilt of the disk changes with the phase along the 35  day cycle ( as predicted by the precessing disk models , see @xcite ) the shift in phase should therefore vary with @xmath1 .",
    "however , both einstein and sax data were obtained at the same @xmath1 .    the phase shift derived from _ xmm - newton _ data main - on state data are considerably different from previous observations made in the main - on state and continues to change during the other two observations .",
    "this suggests that we are observing , a _ substantial and continuous variation in the tilt of the disk _ , which is what we would expect from a system which had a precessing accretion disc .",
    "it should be noted that the interpretation of the phase shift observed at the short - on may be affected by a systematic error , depending on whether during the observation the soft peak `` a '' is higher than the small hard peak `` b '' or vice - versa .      at @xmath16",
    ", there is little evidence for a significant variation in the fe line parameters , while at @xmath17 , there is some evidence that the variation of the equivalent width of the fe line is in anti - phase with the ( 24 )  kev intensity curve and follows the general shape of the ( 0.30.7 )  kev intensity curve . at @xmath9 , we find that the soft flux below 0.7  kev , the line normalization , the line width and the equivalent width all exhibit a common minimum at @xmath18 , which , in turn , is shifted with respect to that of the hard emission .",
    "this supports the idea that the 6.4  kev fe line originates from fluorescence from the relatively cold matter of the illuminated spot where the soft emission is reprocessed .",
    "we have also found evidence for a variation in the fe line broadening over the 35  day period .",
    "in addition , the energy of the fe line suggests that the fe line emission originates from low ionisation species ( fe xiv or less ) in the low and short - on state observations , whereas in the main - on the observed fe k centroid energies ( @xmath19  kev for mos and @xmath20  kev for pn ) correspond to fe xx - fe xxi .    taking this into account , the true centroids deviate by @xmath21 from the 6.40",
    "kev neutral value .",
    "this suggests two possible explanations for both the line broadening and the centroid displacement : 1 ) an array of fe k fluorescence lines exists for a variety of charge states of fe ( anything from fe i - fe xiii to fe xxiii ) ; 2 ) comptonization from a hot corona with a significant optical depth for a narrower range of charge states centered around fe xx .",
    "the fe line broadening may also be explained in terms of keplerian motion , if the inner disk ( or some inner region ) comes into view during the main - on state .",
    "if this is the case , at @xmath9 the keplerian velocity will be @xmath22 km / sec .",
    "this , in turn , corresponds to a radial distance of @xmath23  cm ( for a neutron star of 1.4 ) , which is close to the magneto - spheric radius for a magnetic field of @xmath24  g.      choi , c. s. , 1994 , apj , 437 , 449 gerend , d. , & boynton , p.e .",
