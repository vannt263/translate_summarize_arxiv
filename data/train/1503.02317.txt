    "super - massive black holes ( smbh ) are among the most mysterious objects in the universe .",
    "black holes are called `` super - massive '' if their mass exceeds @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the solar mass .",
    "it is now believed that each galaxy harbors at least one super - massive black hole .",
    "the black hole nature of the massive object at the center of our milky way galaxy has now been established without much doubt by the precision observations of stellar orbits about it ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the ultra - luminous quasars and active galactic nuclei observed in other galaxies are believed to harbor black holes ( see e.g.  @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the origin of super - massive black holes is still somewhat of a mystery .",
    "it is believed ( see  @xcite ) that they result from accretion of gas about massive seed objects .",
    "three candidate seed types are population iii stars with mass in the range @xmath3 , dense matter clouds with mass between @xmath4 and @xmath1 , or compact objects of mass between @xmath5 and @xmath6 formed by the collision of old stellar clusters .",
    "however , we must now explain the origin of the purported seeds of the super - massive black holes .",
    "the recent observations of smbhs of larger masses and higher redshifts are leading to an increasing tension with the standard paradigm of early universe cosmology according to which the spectrum of primordial cosmological fluctuations is approximately gaussian with an almost scale - invariant spectrum with a small red tilt . in the context of this model",
    "nonlinearities form only at late times and there is not enough time to produce the nonlinear massive seeds which are required to seed smbhs of mass greater or equal to @xmath7 at redshifts of @xmath8 or higher ( of which roughly 40 have been discovered  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the recently discovered black hole with mass @xmath9 at redshift @xmath10  @xcite is hard to explain in the context of the standard paradigm .",
    "here we discuss the possibility that the compact seeds which are required to be present at high redshifts are provided by cosmic string loops .",
    "string loops are nonlinear seed masses which are present at arbitrarily early times and which by gravitational accretion can seed the objects which develop into smbhs .    in the following",
    "we first give a very brief review of the connection between cosmic strings and early universe cosmology .",
    "we then compare the number densities of nonlinear seeds in the vanilla @xmath0cdm cosmology with what is obtained when allowing for the presence of a scaling distribution of cosmic strings .",
    "we find that whereas the probability of finding a seed in the range of population iii stars in the vanilla @xmath0cdm model is too low to explain the presence of smbhs of the mass and redshift recently discovered  @xcite , the presence of cosmic strings easily solves this problem as long as the mass per unit length @xmath11 of the strings obeys the inequality @xmath12 . here",
    ", @xmath13 is newton s gravitational constant and where we are using natural units with @xmath14 .",
    "we recover the appropriate powers of @xmath15 when computing dimensionful observable quantites .",
    "cosmic strings are linear topological defects which are predicted in a large class of particle physics models beyond the standard model ( see  @xcite for reviews on cosmic strings ) . in particular , cosmic strings are predicted to form after inflation in many inflationary models , both models formulated in the context of superstring theory  @xcite and in models based on supergravity  @xcite . as first realized by kibble  @xcite , causality arguments tell us that if nature is described by a particle physics model which admits cosmic string solutions , then a network of cosmic strings will inevitably form in the early universe and persist to the present time .",
    "the distribution of cosmic strings consists of a network of infinite strings and a set of string loops .",
    "analytical arguments tell us that the distribution of cosmic strings will approach a `` scaling distribution '' in which @xmath16 , the mean curvature radius and separation of the long string network , will be of the order of the hubble radius @xmath17 .",
    "the non - trivial dynamics of the long string segments will lead to continuous loop production , and the distribution of loops will also take on a scaling solution in which the number density @xmath18 of loops per unit radius @xmath19 is independent of time when @xmath19 is scaled to the hubble radius @xmath17 .",
    "we will assume a simplified version of the cosmic string loop scaling distribution according to which all loops formed at time @xmath17 have the same radius @xmath20 , r_f(t ) = t , where @xmath21 is the mean ratio of circumference to radius of a loop ( we will use the value @xmath22 ) , and @xmath23 is a constant whose value we shall take to be  @xcite @xmath24 .",
    "loops are formed continuously in time . note",
    "that whereas the value of @xmath21 has little uncertainty , the value of @xmath23 depends on details of the implementation of cosmic string evolution simulations , and there is a large range of possible values .",
    "we have taken a representative value from the most recent cosmic string evolution simulations .",
    "after formation , the number density of loops redshifts due to the cosmic expansion .",
    "loops also slowly decay by emitting gravitational radiation  @xcite , and this gives an effective lower cutoff for the range of string loop radii at any given time .",
    "however , the string loops whose mean separation is comparable in comoving coordinates to the separation @xmath25 of galaxies have a radius larger than the gravitational radiation cutoff . they are also formed before the time @xmath26 of equal matter and radiation ( the reader is invited the check these statements ) . for such loops the number density per unit radius is given by [ distrib ] n(r , t ) = n ^5/2 ^-5/2",
    "t_^1/2 t^-2 r^-5/2 , where the number @xmath27 is determined by the number of long string segments per hubble volume . inserting for @xmath17 the present time @xmath28 gives the comoving number density of these loops .",
    "the trapped energy in cosmic strings leads to unique signals in cosmology .",
    "long string segments produce a conical discontinuity in space which leads to lensing signals in cmb temperature maps  @xcite , and to planar overdensities ( called `` wakes '' ) @xcite in the plane behind the moving strings which in turn lead to direct b - mode polarization signals  @xcite and to wedges of extra absorption in 21 cm redshift maps  @xcite ( see  @xcite for an overview of these effects )",
    ".    string loops , on the other hand , accrete matter in a similar way as a point mass ( as long as distances large compared to the loop radius are considered ) .",
    "it was at one point  @xcite postulated that cosmic string loops might be the seeds of galaxies and galaxy clusters , without the need for gaussian fluctuations such as provided by inflation or its alternatives .",
    "however , cosmic strings forming during a phase transition in the early universe produce isocurvature fluctuations and hence do not lead to coherent curvature perturbations on super - hubble scales , and hence do not generate acoustic oscillations in the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave anisotropies .",
    "the discovery of these oscillations  @xcite demonstrated that the main source of fluctuations can not be due to cosmic strings .",
    "the most reliable limit on the cosmic string tension in fact comes from detailed analyses of the cmb angular power spectrum and yields  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) g < 1.5 10 ^ -7 .",
    "string loops , however , may still play an important role in cosmology . in a recent paper  @xcite we postulated that string loops may seed globular clusters .",
    "here we will study their role as possible seeds for smbhs .",
    "in the following we first review the mechanism by which compact seeds can lead to smbhs .",
    "then we compute the expected distribution of seeds as a function of mass and redshift in the @xmath0cdm model and show that the number of seeds of mass required to explain the most massive high redshift smbhs is too low . in the third subsection",
    "we then compute the number density of seeds induced by cosmic string loops and show that the string models can easily make up the deficit of seeds for reasonable values of the tension @xmath11 .",
    "a compact seed evolves into a smbh by accreting gas at a rate that is proportional to its bolometric luminosity . in this way",
    ", an initial seed mass @xmath29 grows into a final mass @xmath30 according to the equation m_f = m_i exp ( ) , where @xmath31 is the time interval during which accretion takes place , @xmath32 is the eddington time , @xmath33 is the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the eddington luminosity  @xcite , and @xmath34 is the efficiency of radiative emission which typically depends on the black - hole spin , and we shall take @xmath35 ( see  @xcite ) . expressing time in terms of redshift this equation can be re - written as m(z_i ) & = & m(z ) + & & , where @xmath36 is the initial seed mass at redshift @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the mass at the final redshift @xmath39 .",
    "[ fig : eddington ] shows the seed mass @xmath36 required to form a smbh at final redshift @xmath40 ( the redshift of the recently discovered object ) and for final smbh masses of @xmath41 ( the estimated mass of the discovered object ) , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , assuming @xmath44 .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath37 and the vertical axis is the mass .",
    "the two dashed horizontal lines at @xmath45 and @xmath46 give the mass range of the postulated population iii star seeds .",
    "the graph shows that seeds in this mass range had to have been present at redshift of greater than 40 in order to grow into the recently observed smbh with mass of @xmath9 .",
    "the seeds for @xmath47 objects needed to have been present in the required number density by redshift of @xmath48 . as we will show in the next subsection",
    ", we do not expect the @xmath0cdm model to yield any nonlinear objects of the required masses at these high redshifts .",
    "the initial redshift at which the larger seed masses postulated for the two other conventional sources of smbh formation needed to have been present is smaller , but since the mass is larger , this does not necessarily make them easier to produce in the standard paradigm of early universe cosmology , as we will see in the following subsection .    the assumption that @xmath49 implies that smbhs accrete mass at the eddington rate .",
    "if the accretion process were sub - eddington , it would force the seeds to have been present at even higher redshifts and thus increase the tension with @xmath0cdm . for simplicity",
    ", we consider eddington accretion as a limiting case , keeping in mind that more massive seeds may be required at even higher redshifts .",
    "obviously , if the accretion were super - eddington , there the tension with the standard cosmological model would be less ( see  @xcite ) . for studies trying to constrain @xmath33 ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .          for gaussian fluctuations , it is exponentially unlikely to obtain a nonlinear fluctuation of mass @xmath50 if the root mean square value of the dimensionless density power spectrum @xmath51 is smaller than @xmath52 .",
    "more precisely , the mass function @xmath53 at redshift @xmath39 is given by ( see e.g.  @xcite ) [ massfct ] n(m , z ) m = m^-1 ^-1 f ( ) , where @xmath54 is the background density and @xmath55 is the excess over the r.m.s .",
    "value required to form a nonlinear object , i.e. [ nu ] ( ) ^2 .",
    "the number @xmath56 and its redshift dependence depend slightly on the background cosmology . for our analysis",
    "we will take the value @xmath57 ( independent of redshift )  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to neglecting the effects of dark energy .",
    "this is a good approximation for our problem where we are interested in high redshifts where dark energy does not have an important effect . for the function",
    "@xmath58 we will use the press - schechter  @xcite form [ eff ] f ( ) = ( ) ^1/2 e^- / 2 .",
    "we are interested in mass ranges for which the corresponding wavelength is smaller than the hubble radius at @xmath26 and which are hence in the region where the power spectrum increases only logarithmically as @xmath59 .",
    "specifically , we make the ansatz [ sigma ] ^2(m ) = a ( m_c / m ) ( 1 + z)^-2 , where the last factor is the linear perturbation theory growth of the amplitude of the power spectrum . if we choose @xmath60 to be the mass scale where @xmath61 today then we can set @xmath62 .",
    "inserting  ,  , and   into the expression for the mass function , we can determine the mass @xmath63 of seeds which have the comoving separation of galaxies at redshift @xmath39 .",
    "this amounts to solving the equation [ eq : dn1 ] d_^3 n(m , z ) m = 1 for the mass @xmath50 , where @xmath25 is the comoving separation of galaxies .",
    "we take @xmath64 independent of redshift , but a more sophisticated analysis could introduce some redshift dependence , although this may no be well - constrained at high redshifts .",
    "we find the following transcendental equation from eq .  , 1 & = & d_^3 _ c ( ) ^1/2 ( z + 1 ) + & & m^-1 exp .    solving for @xmath50 , the resulting function @xmath63 is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : gauss_fluct ] .",
    "note the exponential decrease of the seed mass at high redshifts .",
    "this implies that the gaussian fluctuations in the standard @xmath0cdm model have trouble explaining the origins of the massive compact seeds which are required to explain the formation of the highest redshift and most massive observed smbhs . at redshifts of 20 and higher , the mass of the predicted seeds with the number density of galaxies is smaller than @xmath5 . in the following subsection",
    "we find that cosmic string loops can come to the rescue .      here",

    "the curves are for values @xmath69 ( top curve ) and @xmath70 ( bottom curve ) .",

    "we can now compute the mass @xmath63 at redshift @xmath39 of seeds with a mean separation of @xmath25 .",

    "the discovery of super - massive black holes at redshifts greater than @xmath85 and with masses greater than @xmath80 is challenging to explain in the context of a pure @xmath0cdm cosmology since the number density of the required seeds is not predicted to be high enough ( unless super - eddington accretion is invoked ) . in this note",
    "we have suggested that cosmic string loops might be the seeds about which super - massive black holes form .",
    "cosmic string loops lead to massive compact objects already at high redshift , and can thus provide the massive seeds at high redshifts which are missing in the vanilla @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we have computed the masses of seeds with the correct number density to explain the origin of one smbh per galaxy both with and without cosmic strings .",
    "we note that the one smbh per galaxy condition is more stringent then necessary since not all galaxies need to host a smbh at high @xmath39 to host one today  @xcite .",
