    "a spin - flop transition is a well - known characteristic feature of easy - axis antiferromagnets .",
    "it is caused by a competition between the anisotropy energy , which is minimized by aligning the order parameter along the easy axis , and the zeeman energy , which is minimized for an antiferromagnet by aligning the order parameter perpendicularly to the field .",
    "thus , at a certain field value , the order parameter re - orients itself , going away from the easy axis . for a collinear antiferromagnet",
    "only one transition of such sort is usually observed when the magnetic field is applied along the easy axis .",
    "the quasi - one - dimensional compound bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 has attracted much interest due to its `` excessive '' spin - flop transitions .",
    "the main exchange integral in this compound is j=24.1mev , while inter - chain interactions are a factor of 100 smaller @xcite .",
    "it orders antiferromagnetically at @xmath2k .",
    "the ordered local magnetic moment at zero field was found to be equal to 0.15@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the easy axis of magnetization is aligned along the @xmath4 direction of the orthorhombic crystal .",
    "this is confirmed by magnetization measurements @xcite and by neutron diffraction results @xcite . instead of the expected single spin - flop transition ,",
    "two spin - flop transitions were observed on the magnetization curves when the field was applied along the easy axis @xmath5 @xcite at @xmath6 t and @xmath7 t .",
    "later , ultrasonic studies @xcite have revealed another phase transition when the field was applied perpendicularly to the easy axis @xmath8 , with a critical field value of @xmath9 t .",
    "finally , a spin - reorientation transition in the third orientation @xmath10 was observed by electron - spin - resonance @xcite with a critical field of @xmath11 t .",
    "the exact reason for these numerous phase transitions is not completely clear yet .",
    "it was suggested that a strong reduction of the ordered moment could increase the importance of the anisotropy of the transverse susceptibility @xcite .    despite these unusual properties ,",
    "a detailed characterization of the magnetic phase diagram of this compound remains incomplete .",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath5 orientation was determined by magnetization measurements @xcite and ultrasonic studies @xcite . for the @xmath8 orientation , only ultrasonic data are available @xcite .",
    "finally , the phase transition in the @xmath10 orientation was reported only at a temperature of 1.5k in electron - spin resonance experiments @xcite .",
    "no magnetization studies of the phase transitions for @xmath12 were reported to date .    in the present paper we fill in these gaps and report results of magnetization and specific heat studies of the phase diagram of bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we used single crystalline samples of bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 taken from the same batch as those used in ref.@xcite .",
    "all measurements were performed on the same sample of approximate size @xmath13 mm@xmath14 .",
    "sample orientation was checked by x - ray diffraction on a bruker apex - ii diffractometer .",
    "the misalignment of the mounted sample is estimated to be within 5@xmath15 .",
    "magnetization was measured by a quantum design mpms - xl squid - magnetometer and a quantum design ppms system equipped with a vibrating sample magnetometer .",
    "specific heat was measured using quantum design ppms system .",
    "it was measured by applying a controlled heat pulse to the platform with the sample , which is connected to the cryostat with a stable heat - link .",
    "the sample temperature relaxation curve @xmath16 was then fitted by a two-@xmath17 model , yielding the value of the specific heat . to improve the precision of the transition temperature determination , a slope analysis technique was additionally used .",
    "this technique makes use of the thermal balance equation @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the total specific heat of the sample and the platform , @xmath20  the heater power , @xmath21  the heat link thermal conductivity , @xmath22 and @xmath23  being the temperatures of the sample and of the cryostat , respectively ) .",
    "examples of magnetization and specific heat curves are shown in figures [ fig : m(h ) ] and [ fig:14t_c(t ) ] .",
    "both demonstrate clear anomalies at the phase transitions .",
    "this allows to build phase diagrams in all orientations of the applied magnetic field , as shown in figure [ fig : t - h ] .",
    "the zero - field transition temperature is @xmath24k .",
    "the transition temperature is field dependent , without strong anomalies at the crossings of the phase transition lines . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the transition temperature slightly increases with field , while for the other two principal orientations , it decreases with field .",
    "the transition temperatures at a field of 14 t are : for @xmath10 @xmath25k , for @xmath8 @xmath26k , for @xmath5 @xmath27k .",
    "the low - temperature values of the critical fields , as determined by our magnetization measurements , are : for @xmath5 @xmath28 t , @xmath29 t ; for @xmath8 @xmath30 t ; and for @xmath10 @xmath31 t .",
    "these values are in good agreement with published data @xcite .",
    "the critical field values are weakly temperature dependent : the corresponding phase transition lines are almost horizontal .",
    "the measured magnetic susceptibilities of the higher - field phases are always higher than those of lower - field phases ( see figure [ fig : m(h ) ] ) .",
    "this confirms the identification of the field - induced phase transitions as spin - reorientation transitions , caused by the competition between the order parameter anisotropy and the zeeman energy .",
    "susceptibility jumps @xmath32 at these transitions , as measured at 2k , are : for @xmath5 @xmath33emu/(mole  cu ) and @xmath34emu/(mole  cu ) , for the first and second spin - flops , respectively ; for @xmath8 @xmath35emu/(mole  cu ) ; and for @xmath10 @xmath36emu/(mole  cu ) .",
    "a model that describes all low - temperature phase transitions and antiferromagnetic resonance frequency - field dependences was proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this model suggests that anisotropic contributions to the transverse susceptibility are unusually large in bacu@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath1 , probably due to the strong reduction of the ordered magnetic moment .",
    "the low - energy dynamics of the antiferromagnetic order parameter is then described by the potential energy :    @xmath37}^2+a_1l_x^2+a_2l_y^2+\\xi_1{\\bigl(\\mathbf{h}\\cdot\\mathbf{l}\\bigr)}h_xl_x + \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\xi_2{\\bigl(\\mathbf{h}\\cdot\\mathbf{l}\\bigr)}h_yl_y -(\\xi_1+\\xi_2){\\bigl(\\mathbf{h}\\cdot\\mathbf{l}\\bigr)}h_zl_z-\\nonumber\\\\ & & -b_1h_x^2(l_y^2-l_z^2)-b_2h_y^2(l_x^2-l_z^2)-b_3h_z^2(l_x^2-l_y^2)+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + c_1h_yh_zl_yl_z+c_2h_xh_zl_xl_z+c_3h_xh_yl_xl_y\\label{eqn : energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , cartesian coordinates are chosen as @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the antiferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "the exchange part of the transverse susceptibility is set to unity for the sake of convenience .",
    "the phase transitions are described in terms of this potential energy as rotations of the order parameter @xmath41 . in the low - field phases ,",
    "the order parameter is aligned along the easy axis , @xmath42 . when the field is applied along the easy axis @xmath43",
    ", it rotates at @xmath44 towards the second easy axis , @xmath45 , and at @xmath46 , towards the hard axis @xmath47 .",
    "when the field is applied along @xmath48 or @xmath49 , the order parameter rotates towards the @xmath49 or the @xmath48 axis at @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "these orientations of the order parameter are shown schematically in figure [ fig : t - h ] .",
    "the parameter values , all determined from best fits of the electron spin resonance data @xcite , are : @xmath52ghz / koe , @xmath53koe@xmath54 , @xmath55koe@xmath54 , @xmath56=0.0047 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath61 constants could be ignored in the principal orientations of the magnetic field .",
    "our magnetization measurements allow an independent check of this model , since susceptibility jumps at the phase transitions are related to certain parameters of the potential ( [ eqn : energy ] ) . predicted susceptibility jumps at spin - reorientation transitions are : @xmath62    here , @xmath63 are susceptibility jumps at the corresponding critical field @xmath64 . in order to exclude the scaling factor involved in the choice of energy units in eqn.[eqn : energy ]",
    "they can be normalized to @xmath65 .",
    "the correspondence between experimental and model values is close to perfect .",
    "thus , the magnetization measurements are fully compatible with the proposed form of potential energy .",
    "this supports the model of phase transitions proposed in ref.@xcite and points to the non - trivial effects of spin - reduction on spin - reorientation transitions in low - dimensional antiferromagnets ."
