    "the superconductivity is the intrinsic capacity of certain materials that allows to conduct electric currents without resistance and losses of energy in specific conditions . in 1911",
    "it was discovery by heike kamerlingh onnes@xcite when observed the electric resistance of the mercury disappear abrupt at 4.2k . in the next years",
    "several materials were discovered showing the occurrence of this phenomenon below certain critical temperature value @xmath5 .",
    "a microscopic explanation was not arrived until 1960 , when bardeen , schriefer and cooper proposed a successful theory , today known as the bcs theory .    with the discovery of the @xmath1 superconductor in 1986 at @xmath6 , was open a new stage , up to now devoted to the obtaining and investigation of such kind of high @xmath5 superconductors . in this case , up to nowadays it had not been possible to develop a full explanation for high temperature superconductivity .",
    "the essential characteristic of the first discovered htc superconductor @xmath1 , and various others in its class , is that it has a crystalline structure containing cuo2 layers , inside a perovskite structure separated by block layers , who play a main role as charge reservoirs .",
    "usually , the block layers are insulators and do not have any contribution to the low energy electronics states .",
    "on another hand in the layers , the minimum energy of the electronics state are around the fermi level .    at half filling ( hole concentration p=0 ) , the cuprates are antiferromagnetic insulators ( afi ) , with a neel temperature near 300 @xmath7 . when the number of holes grow , the antiferromagnetic phase is rapidly destroyed and the cuprates show a pseudogap phase .",
    "if you continue doping with hole , the metallic phase turns up .    in 1930",
    "bloch and wilson @xcite developed the band theory , that explain why several materials are metals and another are insulators . however the band theory failed in trying to explain the electronic structure of a large number of insulators . in this group were the , and , which were predicted as having metallic behavior .",
    "this result opened the doors for the profound study of the strongly correlated materials , which are characterized by showing strong correlation properties among the electrons .",
    "two of the founding fathers of these studies mott and hubbard , attributed the insulator behavior to the electron - electron correlation .",
    "nowadays , a generalized criterion exists : for getting behaviors like the ones of insulators of mott , it is necessary to take into account the short range correlations between electrons of opposite spin which are included in the phenomenological hubbard models @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that the hf approximation , when is considered from first principles in a elemental electronic system , should not be able to predict the correlation between opposite spin electrons . in the recent works @xcite by using a one band model , solved in the hf approximation , it was obtained a gap at @xmath8 for the , then predicting its insulator behavior .",
    "this reflect that some of the important properties of these materials , that are products of the strong electronic correlations , can be predicted by the model in the hf approximation .",
    "this outcome does not result strange , after taking in mind that , by example the antiferromagnetism , that is a strong correlation property , can be derived form a hf solution of the hubbard model .",
    "the main point to note in this , is that the considered model is not the original first principle electronic system .",
    "in fact the model only differs from a hubbard one in that the near neighbor approximation was not taken .",
    "since the hamiltonian adopted in the model does not includes the spin , the hf solution do not determine a direction for the antiferromagnetism .",
    "this fact define the basic motivation of this work .",
    "it consists in including the spin - orbit interaction in the starting hamiltonian and then study the effect of the spin - orbit interaction in the solutions .",
    "the expectation was to study the magnetic anisotropy of the model .",
    "therefore , he specific objectives of our work are the following ones :    1 .",
    "obtain the form of the spin - orbit operator in the frame of the mentioned model for the superconductor material @xcite .",
    "2 .   afterwards , to evaluate the anisotropy energy of the antiferromagnetic hf states of the model , in the no doping limit of the . for this purpose the mean value of the spin - orbit operator of the electrons with the crystalline field @xcite",
    "is evaluated in the hf states . since the hf solution is degenerated with respect to spin rotations , to evaluate the mean value , the hf states were arbitrarily rotated in the spin structure of their many particles @xcite , by unitary transformations .",
    "these spin rotations are the ones representing corresponding space rotations around an arbitrary spatial axis .",
    "in general , the htscs presents a tetragonal structure , and have one or more planes in its structure separated by layers of another atoms ( ba , o , la , ... ) . in the planes , each cooper ion is coupled to four oxygen ions separated an approximate distance of 1.9  . the critical temperature depended of the maximum number of adjoint layers ( figure [ fig_noplanos_sc ] ) .",
    "the electronic behavior of the cuprates is very strongly determined by the electronic density in the two dimensional layers .",
    "the basic behavior of the layers , is common for all the cuprate superconductors .",
    "+      the family of monolayer compounds , , where x indicates the magnitude of strontium ( ) doping , crystallize to the tetragonal structure centered in body ( bct ) , usually named t structure , showed in the figure [ fig_htc_ec ] . in the the planes",
    "are separated by @xmath9 6.6  , separated by 2 planes of , that act like charge reservoirs , absorbing electrons of the conductor planes under the doping of the material with holes .",
    "+    exist consensus in consider the electronic structure of the , as quasi two dimensional .",
    "this low dimensionality of this electronic system allows to be treated from another viewpoint .",
    "for example collective phenomena , such as fluctuations in spin density waves ( s.d.w ) and charge density waves ( c.d.w ) , could be the origin of the superconducting mechanism @xcite .    in the figure [ fig_tran_fase1 ]",
    ", it is illustrated the phase diagrams in the ( x , t ) plane for the compound , where is the temperature .",
    "even when the absolute antiferromagnetic order and the insulator mott state persist for a wide range of temperatures , it is very sensible at doping .",
    "for example , in the @xmath8 limit , it is lost at @xmath10 doping , but in the pseudogap ( sg ) phases and superconductor ( sc ) ones , exist experimental evidence of a less extended afm order @xcite .",
    "all the ideas mentioned before support the possibility that the afi state ( x=0 ) play a crucial role in guaranteeing first : a correlation between pairs of holes ( sg ) , second : a condensation of these holes toward the sc state @xcite .    in this compound",
    "a structural phase transition occurs . at high temperatures the structure is tetragonal , but for low temperature the cu atoms and the six oxygens around them , stray slowly of their positions , forming an orthorhombic structure . in the majority of the theoretical studies about this compound",
    ", this little distortion is usually ignored .",
    "the crystalline structure of the lsco have simple planes , while the systems and ( ybco ) has double planes .",
    "the intermediate layers of lsco do not have the chains that affects considerably the planes , in contrast with ybco , and the complicate structure that present the intermediate layers of the .",
    "the band diagram shown in the figure [ fig_banda_matheiss ] associated to the was obtained by means of techniques of lapw@xcite .",
    "the last occupied band is half filled , predicting a metallic behavior , and its form suggests a tight - binding nature for the electron gas that occupied it within the effective environment of the rest of the bands .",
    "the less bound electrons to the compound , are the ones of the atoms , that do not have closed their last shells ( 3d ) , at difference with the situation with the ions .",
    "these electrons are the ones that form the last band in the corresponding solid .",
    "predict a tight - binding behavior in the reciprocal plane , title=\"fig : \" ] +    the model proposed in the references @xcite is described in this section .",
    "one of the most used pictures to describe the movement of the valence electrons in a solid with a periodic potential is the tight - binding model .",
    "this model is applicable when the overlapping of the atomic orbitals of the neighbors can be considered small and it can be supposed that is not necessary to carry out significant corrections to the atomic wave functions , created by the interaction with the neighboring orbitals .",
    "the tight - binding approximation provides a reconciliation among the seemingly contradictory representations of the very localized atomic levels and on another hand the free electron model @xcite , in which the wave functions are lineal combination of planes waves .    from the previous comments we can suppose that these electrons are strongly correlated to the base cells , preferably toward the corresponding centers of @xcite",
    ". then , the lattice will be supposed as the square lattice of @xmath11 atoms located at the @xmath4 planes ( see figure [ fig_sub_redes ] ) .",
    "the electrons not belonging to the last band and the nuclear charge that neutralizes them , play a double role .",
    "they act in one hand , as an effective polarizable medium that screens the field produced by a point charge external to them , and in second place , due to their spatial distribution and magnitude , they guarantee with their action the periodic order of the solid , that is modeled with a periodic potential in the lattice of points .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model introduced in the references take the form :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the kinetic energy term , @xmath14 is the periodic potential that exercise the electrons in the partially filled single band , and @xmath15 runs over the points of the lattice of ( see figure [ fig_sub_redes ] ) ,    @xmath16 is the potential of the jellium background correspondingly only to the surplus of charges which neutralize the electrons that partially filled the band ,    @xmath17 screened coulomb potential ,    @xmath18 is the effective potential that feel the electrons that partially filling the last band ,    @xmath19 is the spin - orbit interaction term .",
    "+     +      one of the most useful techniques to find approximate solutions to the schrodinger 's equation is the molecular orbitals approximation . in this approach",
    "it is considered that the electrons occupy spin - orbital functions of a given energy .",
    "this technique is based in the _ variational theorem _ , which state that the expected value of @xmath20 for an arbitrary wave function is not smaller that the lowest eigenvalue @xmath21 corresponding to the exact solution of the equation@xcite .",
    "then , the best wave function is obtained when the energy calculated by the equation ( [ variachf ] ) has a minimum .",
    "@xmath22    then , the problem is reduced to find the solution by finding it form in all the allowed many electronic states , under the condition of making minimal the energy of the system . in the hf formalism one keeps each electron in a spin - orbital , in the field of the nucleus and the other electrons that are in their respective spin - orbitals  ( fixed ) , subject to the constraint that the spin - orbitals are orthonormal .",
    "after this minimization process , the hf equations for individual spin - orbitals result :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the fock operator and @xmath25 are the eigenvalues that represent the energies of the spin - orbitals ( @xmath26 ) .    the fock operator for an arbitrary electron @xmath27 ( equation [ operfock ] ) can be separated in three terms like it is shown next :    @xmath28,\\ ] ]    where the hamiltonian operator @xmath29 is defined by :    @xmath30    here and in what follows , the arguments of the wave functions @xmath27 and @xmath31 , indicate the collection formed by the spacial coordinates and the spin . in absence of interelectronic interactions ( [ corefock ] )",
    "will be the only operator corresponding to the movement of a single electron in the field of the nucleus and the other electrons ,  that  do not pertain to the partially filled band crossing the fermi level .",
    "the direct interaction operator is    @xmath32    where @xmath33 represents the integral for the space coordinates and the sum for the spin coordinates .",
    "this operator correspond to the average potential of an electron in the state @xmath34 .    on the other hand the exchange operator is expressed as :    @xmath35",
    "the equation ( [ fock ] ) is known as the canonical hf equation and the fact that it corresponds to a non linear eigenvalue and eigenfunctions  problem , implies that to find the solutions becomes necessary an iterative procedures .",
    "this fact leads to propose a group of test spin - orbitals that allow to obtain a new group of such orbitals , from which a new fock operator is generated .",
    "the process is repeated until the energy and the functions converges , such a procedure is named the self - consistent field process .      in a general way the spin - orbitals ( @xmath26 )",
    "are expanded by means of a well - known group of basis functions associated with the geometric positions of the nuclei .",
    "this basis should satisfy two practical conditions    1 .",
    "should reasonably describe the physics of the problem .",
    "2 .   the integrals that appears in the mathematical treatment should be evaluates with relative easiness .",
    "the spatial components of the spin - orbitals is expanded in terms of the basis functions generally centered in atoms , according to ( [ basedes ] ) .",
    "the expansion which must be infinite in principle , is truncated using a number of functions * m * , being @xmath36 the coefficients determining each atomic orbital contribution @xmath37 in the linear expansion @xcite",
    "@xmath38    substituting the orbitals expanded according to ( [ basedes ] ) in the hf equation @xcite , a set of matrix equations is obtained which can be :    @xmath39    where * f * is the fock matrix for the @xmath40 ; * s * is the superposition matrix among the elements of the base @xmath41 and * c * is the coefficients matrix @xmath36 .    in the beginnings",
    ", the developing of hf techniques for systems of many particles , like bands and polyatomic complex calculations , was limited by the memory and speed of the machine calculators of that times .",
    "it was necessary to devise , on the basis of arguments and credible approaches , for example like the hole 's fermi model @xcite , mean field approximation , etc , a reduction of the functional space for searching and of the complications of the calculations .",
    "an useful assumption is to consider that the solution states of the system of equations([scf ] ) have quantized spin in the same direction in all the space , that is to say :    @xmath42    if the spatial functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are identical , the hf calculations is named as restrictive , otherwise unrestricted @xcite .",
    "however , due to their definitions , both cases are restrictive .",
    "it can be said that the hf  system of equations ( [ scf ] ) is written in a form being invariant under rotation , because it is not considered the spin quantization in one absolute direction .",
    "that is , the states to be found are not @xmath45 type neither @xmath46 one .",

    "this fits the possibility that using orbitals that neither be even or odd , a non vanishing anisotropy energy could follows .",
    "as it is known that the less bound electrons of the occupy the @xmath2 orbitals , and the electrons considered into our model , are representing the one partially filling the most energetic band in @xmath151 we can expect that the wannier orbitals of our problem should more closely resemble the @xmath152orbitals of @xmath11 .",
    "these @xmath152 orbitals are solutions of the hydrogen atom , .",
    "then , we could assume as the potential in the vicinities of the a coulomb potential alternatively as it was considered in the initial model .",
    "the wannier orbitals of the @xmath152 type are even functions regarding the space coordinates .",
    "the components of the electric field @xmath143 are odd functions because derived of the coulomb potential .",
    "then we uses the previous result to conclude that , if we suppose orbitals of the @xmath152 type then the model again will predicts anisotropy energy null and non easy axis of magnetization",
    ".  however , the possibility of employing a general linear combination of the @xmath2 orbitals of @xmath11 in addition to a more realistic @xmath3 character of the model by including multiple @xmath4 planes , opens the the opportunity to describe the observed antiferromagnetic anisotropy at low doping and temperatures .",
    "to study the influence of the spin - orbit operator in the hartree - fock approximation the operator is projected in the basis of the orbitals proposed in the model :    @xmath153\\textbf{.}\\textrm{b}^{\\textbf{k},l}= \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_{l}(\\textbf{k } ) \\ \\textrm{s}_{\\textbf{k}}\\textbf{.}\\textrm{b}^{\\textbf{k},l}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can include the spin operator to obtain the next matrix equation    @xmath154\\textbf{.}\\textrm{b}^{\\textbf{k},l}= \\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_{l}(\\textbf{k } ) \\",

    "+ @xmath165 .",
    "+ we can conclude that the spin - orbit operator is null in the matrix hartree fock representation , that implies no change in the hartree fock solution .",
    "the same analysis could be done with the three dimensional wannier orbitals and the result using the section(anisotropy energy with orbitals of wannier that are odd or even functions ) would be the same as for bidimensional gaussian wannier orbitals .",
    "we have studied the magnetic anisotropy properties of at zero temperature , in the context of a two - dimensional model of the layers , which hartree fock solutions were obtained in references@xcite . for this purpose the spin - orbit interaction was considered as a perturbation to the initial hamiltonian of the system and the energy was evaluated as a function of the direction of the antiferromagnetic structure of the material , when it is rotated .",
    "the basic conclusions of the work are :      \\2 ) for the gaussian wannier orbitals and their parabolic corresponding effective potential employed in the model , it was obtained that the magnetic anisotropy energy vanishes .",
    "then , an easy axis of magnetization does nt appears and the antiferromagnetic structure does nt align in any direction .",
    "\\3 ) the use of more general wannier orbitals , as can be gaussian atomic three - dimensional or orbital @xmath2 type , assuming that they are even or odd , all produce vanishing vanishing anisotropy energy .",
