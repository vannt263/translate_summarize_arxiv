    "we shall focus on an application concerning the optical conductivity of graphene .    from the quantum field theory point of view , since the 1980 s , a number of powerful covariant methods have been developed to achieve this task for dimensionally regularized feynman diagrams .",
    "one of the most widely used methods is integration by parts ( ibp ) which has been introduced by vasilev , pismak and khonkonen  @xcite and chetyrkin and tkachov .",
    "@xcite it allows to reduce a complicated feynman diagram in terms of a limited number of so - called `` master integrals '' ; such reduction is now automated via it s implementation in computer programs with the help of laporta s algorithm .",
    "@xcite in some simple cases , the master integrals themselves can be computed from ibp alone . in general , however , other methods have to be used often in combination with ibp .",
    "a well known method is the gegenbauer polynomial technique .",
    "@xcite another very powerful but less popular method is the method of uniqueness and we shall focus on this method in the following .",
    "this method owes its name to the so - called uniqueness relation , otherwise known as the star - triangle or yang - baxter relation , which is used in theories with conformal symmetry .",
    "historically , such relation was probably first used to compute three - dimensional integrals by deramo , peleti and parisi .",
    "@xcite within the framework of multi - loop calculations , the method has first been introduced by vasilev , pismak and khonkonen .",
    "@xcite it allows , in principle , the computation of complicated feynman diagrams using sequences of simple transformations ( including integration by parts ) without performing any explicit integration .",
    "a diagram is straightforwardly integrated once the appropriate sequence is found . in a sense , the method greatly simplifies multi - loop calculations .",
    "@xcite as a matter of fact , the first analytical expression for the five - loop @xmath0-function of the @xmath1-model was derived by kazakov using this technique .",
    "@xcite for a given diagram , the task of finding the sequence of transformations is , however , highly non - trivial .    in the following , we will present the method of uniqueness in momentum space in very close analogy with the review of ref .

    "we will then show that it allows a very transparent evaluation of a two - loop massless propagator feynman diagram with a non - integer index on the central line .",
