    "the solution of pure two - dimensional yang - mills theory ( ym2 in the following ) on a general riemann surface has been known for some time .",
    "it was obtained on the lattice in @xcite , and in the continuum in @xcite .",
    "for instance , the partition function of the u@xmath6 theory on a surface of genus @xmath7 and area @xmath8 is @xmath9 where the sum runs on the irreducible representations @xmath10 , of dimension @xmath11 and quadratic casimir @xmath12 , of the u@xmath6 group .",
    "this solution allowed gross and taylor @xcite to describe the u@xmath6 ym2 theory , in the large @xmath13 limit , as a particular type of string theory .",
    "in fact they could show that in this limit the partition function ( [ intro1 ] ) counts distinct maps from world - sheets of genera @xmath14 to the target space represented by the base manifold of genus @xmath7 .",
    "recently , a different way to formulate ym2 on a torus or a cylinder as a string theory has been suggested @xcite , and in this paper we are going to extend this formulation to arbitrary riemann surfaces .",
    "this proposal is inspired by matrix string theory @xcite . in matrix string theory",
    "one considers the @xmath15 supersymmetric ym2 theory , defined on a cylinder .",
    "this theory contains eight scalar fields @xmath16 with their supersymmetric partners @xmath17 in the adjoint representation of the u@xmath6 gauge group . in the limit @xmath18 all these fields commute and can be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "the @xmath13 eigenvalues of @xmath16 take the role of the eight transverse coordinates describing the world - sheets of a gas of free superstrings .",
    "the eigenvalues , however , can be subjected to a permutation as one goes around the compact direction of the cylinder , giving rise to twisted sectors in correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the symmetric group @xmath1 .",
    "strings of different lengths are present in each sector , and correspond to the cycles of the permutation .",
    "in  @xcite we showed that twisted sectors appear naturally in pure ym2 on a torus or a cylinder if one chooses the so - called _ unitary gauge _",
    "@xcite , namely the gauge in which the field strength is diagonal .",
    "their inclusion leads to a partition function that is different from the standard one of  @xcite , has a richer structure and is closely related to the partition function of the whole matrix string theory  @xcite",
    ".    however , in higher genus riemann surfaces there are always divergences associated to the twisted sectors in correspondence of points where two eigenvalues of the field strength coincide .",
    "a rather _ ad hoc _ regularization was suggested in @xcite , whose effect is to suppress all non - trivial sectors in order to reproduce the standard result .",
    "we propose here to study a generalized ym2 ( in the sense of @xcite ) in which such divergences do not occur , and the twisted sectors can be consistently kept into account .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a suitable coupling of the field - strength to the riemann curvature of the space - time manifold .",
    "the action of the generalized theory reduces to the one of ordinary ym2 for flat surfaces . in the generalized theory the twisted sectors are in one - to one correspondence with the unbranched @xmath13-coverings of the surface , and",
    "the original u@xmath6 gauge group reduces to an abelian gauge group for each connected component of the covering . for the torus and the cylinder the results of  @xcite",
    "are reproduced .",
    "all previous results are discussed in sections 2 and 3 . in section 4",
    "we show that , after integration over the non cartan components of the gauge fields , the theory can be described as a lattice gauge theory of a group @xmath19 defined as the semi - direct product of @xmath1 and u@xmath2 . by using known results on the statistics of coverings  @xcite",
    ", we derive in sections 5 and 6 the expression for the partition function on surfaces without boundaries and the kernel function for surfaces with an arbitrary number of boundaries . in section 7 , with the conclusions , we outline the main features of the extension of the present theory to the case of interacting strings ( branched coverings ) and to strings with a non - abelian gauge group on the world - sheet .",
    "consider a two - dimensional gauge theory defined on a riemann surface @xmath20 , with or without boundaries , and with gauge group @xmath21 , for instance u@xmath6 .",
    "assume that the theory contains at least one field @xmath22 transforming in the adjoint representation of @xmath21 ; in the case of u@xmath6 , @xmath22 is a @xmath23 hermitian matrix .",
    "a possible gauge choice consists in choosing @xmath22 with values in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath21 , that is , in the u@xmath6 case , in choosing @xmath22 diagonal ( unitary gauge ) .",
    "in fact it is always possible at each point @xmath24 of @xmath20 to find a gauge transformation @xmath25 that casts @xmath22 into a diagonal form : @xmath26 such gauge fixing is not complete as it leaves a u@xmath2 gauge invariance , and is affected by gribov ambiguities because at each point @xmath24 there are in general @xmath27 different gauge - fixed forms of @xmath22 , related to each other by arbitrary permutations of the eigenvalues : @xmath28    as a consequence of the gribov ambiguity it is not possible in general to put @xmath22 in diagonal form globally , namely on the whole @xmath20 without discontinuities .",
    "in fact if we map @xmath20 into a polygon with pairs of edges suitably identified , and fix the unitary gauge on the polygon ( this is always possible as the bundle is trivial on a disc ) , after gauge fixing the eigenvalues of @xmath22 will in general appear in a different order on the edges that are to be identified .",
    "more precisely : consider a point @xmath24 on @xmath20 , and let @xmath29 be the homotopy group on @xmath20 with base point @xmath24 .",
    "let us order the eigenvalues of @xmath22 in @xmath24 in an arbitrary way , for instance @xmath30 this will be referred to in the rest of the paper as the _ standard order_. consider now a non trivial element @xmath31 of @xmath32 , that is a homotopically non - trivial loop starting from @xmath24 . as we go round the loop",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath22 are subjected to a permutation , or , for a generic gauge group , they are acted upon by an element of the weyl group .",
    "this defines a homomorphism that associates to each element @xmath31 of the homotopy group @xmath32 an element @xmath33 of the weyl group .",
    "the permutation @xmath33 depends on the choice of the base point @xmath24 according to the formula @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a closed loop starting in @xmath36 and defined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an arbitrarily chosen path from @xmath36 to @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath39 is the permutation of the eigenvalues in @xmath24 with respect to the standard order defined above obtained by starting with the eigenvalues in the standard order in @xmath36 and moving to @xmath24 along the chosen path @xmath38 .",
    "( [ conj ] ) shows that changing the base point of the homotopy group , namely deforming the original path @xmath31 into @xmath35 , corresponds to a conjugacy transformation on @xmath40 .",
    "according to this analysis the functional integral over the field configurations of @xmath22 splits into several topological sectors , one for each homomorphism of @xmath32 into @xmath1 .",
    "it is easy to see that in the case of u@xmath6 , where the eigenvalues of @xmath22 are real and the weyl group is the symmetric group @xmath1 , the homomorphic maps of @xmath32 into @xmath1 are in one - to - one correspondence with the @xmath13-coverings of @xmath20 without foldings or branch points . in this correspondence",
    "each eigenvalue of @xmath22 is associated to one sheet of the @xmath13-covering .",
    "such coverings are not in general connected but consist of a certain number of connected parts .",
    "the decomposition of a covering into its connected parts coincides with the decomposition of the representations of @xmath32 into its irreducible subspaces .",
    "a connected part that covers @xmath20 @xmath41 times consists of a @xmath41-dimensional subspace of the @xmath13-dimensional space of the eigenvalues of @xmath22 .",
    "this subspace is invariant under the action of @xmath32 and does not contain any lower dimensional invariant subspace .",
    "each connected part can be thought of as the world - sheet of a two - dimensional string that covers @xmath41 times the target space and that can be described as follows .",
    "let us denote by @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) a set of coordinates parameterizing the world - sheet .",
    "each point @xmath24 of the target space has @xmath41 images on the world - sheet labeled by @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "so we can associate to each point of the world - sheet a single eigenvalue @xmath46 by requiring @xmath47 in the end we have a single eigenvalue and a u@xmath0 gauge invariance associated to each connected part of the covering , namely to each irreducible part of the representation of @xmath32 in terms of elements of @xmath1 .",
    "we may be tempted to conclude that , through the mechanism outlined above , a non abelian gauge theory in two dimensions can be described in terms of a string theory with an abelian gauge theory on its world - sheet .",
    "however this is true only if the abelianization is not spoiled by other terms in the action that induce a coupling between different sheets of the covering .",
    "therefore we have to require that , at least in some limit for the coupling constants , the strings described above are free or weakly coupled .    in this respect",
    "a problem arises directly from the gauge fixing procedure .",
    "indeed , the faddeev - popov determinant for our gauge choice induces a strong interaction between different sheets of the covering .",
    "in fact , the functional integration measure produces , as usual , a squared vandermonde determinant of the eigenvalues of @xmath22 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the area element .",
    "this term is singular when two eigenvalues coincide and indeed it describes an interaction of different world - sheets ( _ i.e. _ eigenvalues ) at the same target space point @xmath24 .",
    "therefore we must require that the vandermonde determinants arising from the gauge fixing are exactly canceled for the string picture outlined above to make sense .",
    "this is obtained in matrix string theories ( dvv )  @xcite by use of supersymmetry . in the limit of vanishing string coupling",
    ", the adjoint scalars @xmath16 and fermions @xmath50 of the theory commute with each other and it is possible to choose a gauge in which they are all diagonal .",
    "however no vandermonde determinant arises from the faddeev - popov procedure because contributions from @xmath16 and @xmath17 cancel exactly .",
    "in  @xcite we showed that the same cancellation of vandermonde determinants occurs in pure two - dimensional yang - mills theory on a torus or a cylinder if the gauge where the field strength @xmath22 is diagonal is chosen .",
    "the ensuing theory has matrix string states , just as the dvv model , and its partition function is closely related to the one of the dvv model itself  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that the results of  @xcite can be extended to include riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus and arbitrary number of borders , if one considers a particular generalized yang - mills theory ( in the sense of  @xcite ) which has the property to coincide with ordinary ym2 on flat surfaces . for the generalized theory",
    "it is shown that the cancellation of the vandermonde determinants occurs also on arbitrary riemann surfaces and that the theory is consistently described by a string theory with a u@xmath0 gauge symmetry on its world - sheet gauge symmetry on the world - sheet whose role was emphasized in @xcite . ] .",
    "we begin by considering the partition function of a generalized ym2 on an arbitrary riemann surface  @xcite . we shall then proceed to fix the gauge in which @xmath22 is diagonal by following essentially ref .",
    "@xcite , where the partition function for ordinary ym2 was calculated in the same gauge .",
    "the partition function is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the volume form on @xmath53 and @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 in eqs .",
    "( [ partriemann ] ) and ( [ effea ] ) @xmath22 is a @xmath56 hermitian matrix and @xmath57 is a one - form on @xmath53 with values in the space of hermitian matrices .",
    "@xmath58 denotes an arbitrary gauge invariant potential , namely a potential that depends only on the eigenvalues of @xmath22 , with in principle an arbitrary dependence from the two - dimensional metric of the surface . in order to reproduce ordinary ym2",
    "it is enough to choose @xmath59 and perform the quadratic functional integral in @xmath22 .",
    "our gauge choice consists in conjugating the @xmath23 hermitian matrix @xmath22 into a diagonal form , namely into its cartan sub - algebra . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "this can always be done locally , according to eq .",
    "( [ pgaugefix ] ) . the gauge fixed action , including the appropriate faddeev - popov ghost term , can be written as the sum of two terms : @xmath60 where @xmath61 involves the diagonal part of @xmath62 and exhibits the residual u@xmath2 gauge invariance : @xmath63~ , \\label{scartan}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the @xmath65-th diagonal term of the matrix form @xmath57 .",
    "the faddeev - popov ghost term and the off - diagonal part of @xmath57 are contained in @xmath66 which can be cast into the following form : @xmath67~ , \\label{offdiag}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 denotes the inverse of the two - dimensional vierbein .",
    "the fields @xmath71 and @xmath72 are respectively the ghost and anti - ghost fields associated to the gauge condition @xmath73 .",
    "the action ( [ offdiag ] ) contains the same number of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom and it is invariant , for each value of the composite index @xmath74 $ ] , with respect to a set of symmetry transformation with grassmann - odd parameters which are reported in  @xcite .",
    "one would expect , as a result of these  supersymmetries \" , a complete cancellation of the bosonic and fermionic contributions in the partition function . however this supersymmetry is broken on a generic riemann surface by the measure of the functional integral .",
    "the reason is that the supersymmetric partners of the ghost and anti - ghost fields are the zero - forms @xmath75 , which are the components of the one - form @xmath57 in the base of the vierbein ( [ flata ] ) .",
    "so if the measure of the functional integral contains the one - form @xmath76 , namely is @xmath77 , there is a mismatch in the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom as on a curved surface the `` number '' of zero - forms and one - forms does not coincide .",
    "this results into an anomaly that was explicitly calculated in  @xcite : @xmath78    after integration over the non - cartan fields , the theory becomes purely abelian with a u@xmath2 gauge symmetry . taking into account ( [ anomaly ] ) , it is described by the effective action @xmath79~ , \\label{scartan2}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is given by @xmath81    the anomaly term at the r.h.s . of ( [ potential ] ) is divergent when two eigenvalues coincide and requires some regularization procedure . in @xcite ,",
    "the calculation of the functional integral for the u@xmath2 theory was done and it turned out to be equivalent to replacing each eigenvalue @xmath82 with an arbitrary constant integer value : @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the flux of the abelian field strength . in this way the anomaly term correctly reproduces the dependence of the standard partition function  @xcite from the genus @xmath7 of @xmath20 , namely the factor @xmath85 .",
    "however while in other gauges  @xcite and in the lattice formulation the integers @xmath84 , being labels of irreducible representations of u@xmath6 , satisfy the condition @xmath86 , in the unitary gauge nothing seems to forbid the existence of  non regular terms \" , namely of terms with at least two such integers coinciding .",
    "non regular terms , which are divergent for @xmath87 , were eliminated by a rather _ ad hoc _ regularization procedure in  @xcite , leaving the problem of a completely consistent derivation of the standard partition function of ym2 in the unitary gauge still open .",
    "it should be noticed that all non trivial maps @xmath88 lead to sectors made entirely by non regular terms ; in fact in a non trivial sector at least two eigenvalues must belong to the same connected world - sheet and , being constant , have to coincide .",
    "so any regularization scheme that sets to zero the non regular terms also disregards all sectors corresponding to non trivial maps @xmath89 .    as already pointed out in  @xcite , non regular terms",
    "are finite in the case of the torus ( @xmath90 ) , and for any surface with zero curvature the anomaly term at the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) vanishes . in this case",
    "no regularization is needed and there is no reason to neglect the non trivial maps in @xmath91 , which for @xmath90 are labeled by pairs @xmath92 of commuting permutations .",
    "the calculation was done by the authors of  @xcite , initially with the hope that the sum over the non trivial maps would just amount to cancel the non regular terms .",
    "surprisingly this happens only if the sum is restricted to the subset of sectors with say @xmath93 , while the entire sum leads to a partition function  @xcite that has a wider spectrum than the standard one , and which is closely related to the partition function of the dvv string matrix model  @xcite .",

    "our point of view can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "quantization in the unitary gauge beyond the @xmath90 case would ask for a consistent regularization scheme ( yet to be found ) to cancel the logarithmic singularities in the anomaly term at the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "we propose instead to achieve the same result by modifying the potential @xmath94 to include in it a term that cancels exactly the divergent anomaly term so that the effective potential @xmath95 is regular and of the form @xmath96 with @xmath97 in this way we define a generalized ym2 theory whose action reduces to the one of standard ym2 in the limit of zero curvature and with a potential @xmath98 .",
    "in other words : we consider a generalized ym2 theory which is the ordinary ym2 with a non standard coupling to gravity .",
    "it is possible , in our opinion , that the one presented above is the only consistent way to quantize ym2 in the unitary gauge .",
    "if that is the case the unitary gauge is not a mere gauge choice , but it defines an entirely new theory . some possible reasons for it are discussed below .",
    "the redefinition of the potential exactly corresponds to the cancellation of the anomaly .",
    "so it is natural to ask : is it possible to define the theory from the beginning in such a way that the fermionic symmetry of ( [ offdiag ] ) is not broken by the integration measure ?",
    "the obvious answer is to use the zero - forms @xmath99 rather than @xmath100 as the independent degrees of freedom in the functional integration measure , which becomes @xmath101 .",
    "this amounts to consider the gauge fields as defined in the tangent space , like spinors , when space - time is curved . in spite of the fact that eq .",
    "( [ flata ] ) is locally invertible this results into a different counting of degrees of freedom .",
    "this is apparent in a lattice formulation .",
    "consider a discretized manifold made of squares with sides all of the same length .",
    "the ghost and anti - ghost fields sit on the sites of the lattice and the gauge fields on the links . on a site @xmath102 where the coordination number @xmath103 is 4 ( zero curvature )",
    "the gauge degrees of freedom match exactly the number of degrees of freedom of the ghost anti - ghost system , otherwise the mismatch is proportional to @xmath104 , namely to the curvature .",
    "this argument provides a lattice based derivation of eq .",
    "( [ anomaly ] ) . with the gauge fields defined on the tangent space , instead",
    ", the degrees of freedom at each site coincide with the one in flat space irrespective of the curvature and no anomaly arises .",
    "we do not know yet how to formulate on a lattice ( for instance in the framework of regge calculus ) the coupling to gravity of gauge fields associated to the tangent space . on the other hand , there are indications that ordinary lattice gauge theory might be inadequate in curved space - time .",
    "consider for instance the standard wilson action : the plaquette variable @xmath105 carries no information about the metric and hence its continuum limit can only depend on quantities that can be written as differential forms , namely @xmath106 however the lagrangian density @xmath107 has a non trivial dependence on the metric and it can be written in the language of differential forms only by using the hodge dual operator .",
    "therefore the coupling of gauge theories to gravity on a lattice seems to require , instead of the traditional wilson action , a first order formalism ( see for instance  @xcite ) where the plaquette variable is coupled with an auxiliary field which in generic space - time dimensions is an antisymmetric tensor @xmath108 , that is a two - form , in the tangent space indices .    [ [ effective - action ] ] effective action + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    with the effective potential @xmath80 given by eqs .",
    "( [ regpot ] ) and ( [ regpot2 ] ) the action ( [ scartan2 ] ) reduces to the sum of @xmath13 decoupled u@xmath0 theories , namely @xmath109    in the functional integral , however , one has to sum over all sectors corresponding to the homomorphisms @xmath91 , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "so in a non trivial sector the u@xmath0 theories in ( [ u1act ] ) are coupled by the boundary conditions : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an element of @xmath112 and @xmath113 the corresponding element of @xmath1 in the homomorphism .",
    "as a result , rather than @xmath13 decoupled u@xmath0 theories , we have a u@xmath114 theory on each connected part of the world - sheet , whose area is an integer multiple @xmath41 of the area @xmath8 of the target space . to each connected world - sheet is associated a u@xmath0 partition function , given by : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is given by eq .",

    "let us consider a surface @xmath53 with the topology of a disc .",
    "since the homotopy group of the disc is trivial , only the identical permutation can be associated to the boundary of the disc and the only covering consists of @xmath13 disconnected copies of the disc . according to the previous discussion the kernel on a disc",
    "is then given by @xmath126 where @xmath8 is the area of the disc and @xmath127 the invariant angles of the u@xmath0 holonomies .",

    "the inverse of a group element is given by @xmath136 the kernel on a disc @xmath137 is invariant under gauge transformations of @xmath19 .",
    "in fact from @xmath138 it follows almost immediately that @xmath139 this property will enable us to formulate the theory described in the previous section as a gauge theory of @xmath19 on a lattice .",
    "in fact suppose to draw on the target space @xmath20 a lattice and to associate to each link @xmath140 an element @xmath141 of @xmath19 .",
    "the product of all the elements of @xmath19 along a plaquette defines the plaquette variable @xmath142 and the partition function is defined as @xmath143 as in the case of the heat - kernel action for a u@xmath6 gauge theory , the boltzmann weight for a single plaquette is left invariant in form if one sews two plaquettes together by integrating over their common link .",

    "[ glue ] this property insures that the result obtained on a lattice is valid also in the continuum limit . on the other hand , it also allows to solve exactly the theory by reducing the surface to a single plaquette with suitably identified links .",

    "the situation is somewhat similar to the one in multi - matrix models , where the angular degrees of freedom can be integrated out in the calculation of the partition function and of certain correlators but are involved in a non trivial way in the most general correlators .    besides its relation with ym2 ,",
    "the @xmath19 gauge theory is interesting by itself , and it can generalized in two different directions that we shall briefly mention here , while leaving the details for a future publication  @xcite .",
    "the first type of extension is the one already considered in  @xcite for the theory of coverings .",
    "it consists in allowing coverings with branch points , namely in allowing the strings to split and join . in the framework of matrix string theory",
    "this was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "a branch point can be described as a boundary where all the u@xmath0 invariant angles are set to zero . in this case , if the permutation associated to the boundary is trivial this just becomes an ordinary point , otherwise it becomes a point where a more or less complicated interaction amongst the sheets of the covering occurs .",
    "the simplest case consists in a single string splitting into two strings or vice - versa , and it is described by a permutation with only one non trivial cycle of order @xmath259 .",
    "> from this point of view the results of section 6 are all we need to introduce branch points in our theory .",
    "however we want to consider , as in  @xcite , the limit where a continuum distribution of branch points is introduced .",
    "for the theory of pure coverings , that is for the gauge theory of @xmath1 , this corresponds to replacing the plaquette action , which for the unbranched theory of coverings is just a delta function , with a sum over irreducible representations of @xmath1 : ( p)=_r d_r _ r(p ) _",

    "the introduction of a continuum of branch points will amount to replacing the plaquette action ( [ boltzmann ] ) with a generic expansion in the characters of the irreducible representations of @xmath19 .",
    "the weight of each representation should contain the area @xmath8 of the plaquette at the exponent , to insure good gluing properties as in ( [ glue ] ) , and will depend both on the potential @xmath116 that appears in the original action and on the couplings of the different types of branch points encoded in @xmath12 .",
    "these couplings are new free parameters of the theory which are not present in the original lagrangian .",
    "as they describe interactions amongst different sheets , they would presumably correspond to singular terms in the u@xmath2 gauge theory obtained after fixing the unitary gauge , possibly of the same type as the ones that have been eliminated by the redefinition of the potential .",
    "a different type of extension is obtained by considering a more general gauge group @xmath260 , defined as the semi - direct product of @xmath261 and u@xmath262 .",
    "the product law in @xmath260 is explicitly given by ( p , g_i)(q , h_i)=(pq , g_i h_p^-1(i ) )  , [ mult ] where @xmath128 and @xmath263 are elements of @xmath261 , @xmath264 and @xmath188 ( @xmath265 ) are elements of u@xmath266 and the products at the r.h.s .",
