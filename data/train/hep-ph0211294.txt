    "the value of strong coupling constant @xmath0 can be extracted from the existing data on deep - inelastic - scattering ( dis ) with experimental uncertainty at the one - percent level . with such experimental accuracy achieved the theoretical uncertainties become dominant .",
    "one of the major theoretical uncertainty in @xmath0 derived from the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd analysis of dis data comes from the higher - order ( ho ) corrections .",
    "therefore , consideration of the next - to - next - to - leading ( nnlo ) corrections is of great importance for suppression of the errors in @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , account of the nnlo terms in the qcd evolution equations for the dis structure functions , which have been calculated recently  @xcite , allows to reduce the ho uncertainty in @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath3 , as it was estimated in ref .",
    "another important source of the uncertainty in @xmath0 is the high - twist ( ht ) contribution to the structure functions .",
    "this contribution inevitably appear in the operator product expansion  @xcite , but unfortunately can not be reliably estimated hitherto . in the limited range of the momentum transfer @xmath4 the ht terms , which fall with @xmath4 by the power law , can simulate the logarithmic - type behavior of the leading twist ( lt ) term . for this reason the magnitude of ht terms is correlated with the value of @xmath0 , which defines the slope of the lt term , and the uncertainty in ht terms propagates into the uncertainty of @xmath0 .",
    "we study impact of these sources of uncertainties on the value of @xmath0 obtained from a nnlo qcd analysis of existing data on the charged - leptons dis off the proton and deuterium targets  @xcite .",
    "the data outside the kinematical region of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are left out to suppress potentially dangerous theoretical uncertainties keeping sufficient sensitivity of data to the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the data are analyzed using a numerical integration of the qcd evolution equations in the @xmath7-space ( details are described elsewhere  @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath8 obtained in the recent update of this fit is  @xcite @xmath9 to be compared with @xmath10 obtained by santiago and yndurain from the analysis of the proton subset of data  @xcite .",
    "the achieved experimental error in @xmath8 is quite small and therefore , complimentary analysis of theoretical uncertainties is necessary in order to clarify the confident range of @xmath0 variation .",
    "generally , estimate of the ho uncertainty is impossible before the ho corrections are known .",
    "however , the approach based on variation of the qcd renormalization scale ( rs ) is commonly used for estimation of the ho uncertainties .",
    "this approach is very approximate since it does not account for a possible @xmath7-dependence of the corresponding scale - factor and since the variation range of the scale - factor is optional .",
    "nevertheless , following this approach we estimate the ho uncertainty as the change of @xmath0 caused by variation of the qcd rs from @xmath4 to @xmath11 .",
    "the estimates obtained are given in table  [ tab : als ] .",
    "note the reduction of @xmath0 with the pqcd order approximately coincide with the corresponding ho uncertainties because of going from the nlo to the nnlo disagrees with the results of nnlo analysis by santiago and yndurain , but agrees with the estimates of ref.@xcite and results of the nnlo fit of ref.@xcite . ] . extrapolating this regularity to the n@xmath12lo we have an estimate @xmath13 .",

    "the ht terms can be taken into account using different approaches .",
    "firstly , one can parameterize the ht terms by a flexible model independent function . in this approach",
    "possible uncertainties in variation of the ht terms allowed by data merge into the total experimental error in @xmath0 .",
    "secondly , one can cut data with low momentum transfer @xmath4 and/or hadronic mass @xmath15 . evidently in the second approach the ht error vanishes",
    ", however the statistical error can rise because the qcd evolution introduces the largest effect at small @xmath4 and therefore this region is most sensitive to the value of @xmath0 .",
    "thirdly , one can take into account the ht terms using available theoretical models . in this approach",
    "the ht uncertainty is subject of belief in reliability of the model .    in the analysis of ref.@xcite we parameterize the twist-4 terms in additive form , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the lt terms corrected for the target mass effects  @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath18 are defined in a piece - linear form with fitted coefficients that provides the model - independent account of the ht terms .",
    "one does need to include the ht terms in the analysis since they improve quality of the fit ( @xmath19 with and @xmath20 without them ) .",
    "possible logarithmic @xmath4-dependence of @xmath21 at @xmath22 could decrease the fitted @xmath0 value  @xcite , however data used in our analysis are not sensitive to such modifications of @xmath21 because of the cut on @xmath7 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is strongly anti - correlated with @xmath23 at large @xmath7 ( see fig.[fig : cor ] ) .",
    "for this reason the error in @xmath0 is much larger than it could be in the absence of the ht terms .",
    "indeed , in our trial fit with the ht terms set to 0 , the error in @xmath14 is 0.0003 . comparing this error with the error in @xmath0 obtained in our analysis with the ht terms accounted for , we estimate the ht error in @xmath14 to be 0.0014 .",
    "this is the major source of the error in @xmath24 , more important than the estimated uncertainty due to the ho .",
    "the results of scan fits with different cuts on @xmath4 and with no ht terms included are given in fig.[fig : scanq ] .",
    "these results suggest the optimal value of @xmath25 , which provide balance between stability of the central value of @xmath0 and its error .",
    "for @xmath26 the value of @xmath27 was obtained .",
    "this value agrees with the results of analysis with the ht terms included that supports the both approaches . at that the value of @xmath8 derived from the fit with the ht terms included is preferable since it is more robust due to the wider set of data",
    "was used in this case .",
    "the cut on @xmath15 leaves out the data at small @xmath4 and large @xmath7 and therefore makes fit less sensitive to the ht terms however not so efficiently as the cut on @xmath4 since the ht terms are important for moderate @xmath7 as well . with the increase of the minimal value of @xmath15 the error in @xmath0",
    "gets inappreciably large earlier than its central value is sustained .    in the analysis by santiago and",
    "yndurain the value of @xmath0 was obtained from the fit with the ht terms set to 0 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath0 caused by this constraint was estimated as a difference between the value of @xmath0 obtained from the fit with the ht terms set to 0 and that of the fit with ht terms described by the gradient model . in this model",
    "the ht contribution to @xmath28 reads @xmath29/q^2 $ ] , where @xmath30 is the non - singlet structure function and @xmath31 is a normalization parameter determined from data .",
    "we find @xmath32 in the trail fit with @xmath33 described by the gradient model in order to better match the data set used in ref.@xcite . ] .",
    "we find that in this fit @xmath14 changes by 0.0006 with respect to that of the fit with ht terms set to 0 .",
    "this value agrees with 0.0004 obtained in the analysis by santiago and yndurain .",
    "however this shift in @xmath0 can not be considered as a reliable estimate of the ht uncertainty in @xmath0 , since the gradient model describes the ht terms very poorly ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this is not surprising , because the gradient model can only be justified at @xmath22 and can not be applied in the whole region of @xmath7 ( see fig.[fig : gsa ] ) .",
    "a correct estimate of the ht uncertainty in @xmath0 in the analysis by santiago and yndurain would be given by a variation of @xmath14 due to going from the fit with the ht terms set to 0 to the fit with the ht terms parameterized in the model - independent way . in our analysis",
    "such variation is @xmath35 , much larger than estimate of the ht uncertainty based on the gradient model .",
    "taking into account this variation , we conclude that in fact eqn.([eqn : asa ] ) disagrees with eqn.([eqn : asy ] ) this disagreement is evidently connected with the substantial difference between the gluon distributions obtained in different fits .",
    "the gluon distribution was estimated in the analysis by santiago and yndurain as @xmath36  @xcite with the momentum carried by gluons @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "this is much larger than the typical value of @xmath39 obtained in the recent global fits of pdfs  @xcite .",
    "independent estimation of this quantity based on the results of cdhs collaboration @xcite is @xmath40 , also much lower than the result by santiago and yndurain .",
    "we comment that due to the value of @xmath0 is anti - correlated with the gluon distribution at small @xmath7 , the increase in @xmath0 caused by the absence of the ht terms in that analysis is compensated by its decrease due to enhanced gluons .",
    "we also estimate theoretical errors connected with account of the heavy quarks contribution . these errors are more important than in our previous determination of @xmath0 due to growing impact of the recent low-@xmath7 hera data .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath14 due to choice between the fixed - flavor - number and the variable - flavor - number factorization schemes is estimated as 0.0007 .",
    "the variation of the @xmath41-quark mass by @xmath42 leads to the variation in @xmath14 of 0.0006 .",
    "other possible sources of theoretical errors , including uncertainties in the nnlo evolution kernel and in the strange quarks distribution , are not considered because they give much smaller effect . summarizing all sources of theoretical errors we get @xmath43",
    "this value is somewhat lower than the world average value of ref.@xcite but agrees with it within errors .",
