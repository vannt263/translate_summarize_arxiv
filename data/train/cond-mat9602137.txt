    "following the early work of wigner@xcite , dyson in his classic 1962 paper@xcite classified complex many - body systems such as atomic nuclei according to their fundamental symmetries . arguing on mathematical grounds , he proposed the existence of three symmetry classes , which are distinguished by their behavior under reversal of the time direction and by their spin .",
    "the statistical properties of these classes are described by three random - matrix models , called the gaussian orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ensembles ( goe , gue , gse ) .",
    "dyson s classification scheme has since proved very far reaching .",
    "although atomic nuclei display only goe statistics , physical realizations of the other two classes were later found in chaotic and disordered single - electron systems subject to a magnetic field ( gue ) or to spin - orbit scattering ( gse ) .    by standard arguments , wigner - dyson statistics applies to the _ ergodic _ limit , i.e. to times long enough for the degrees of freedom to equilibrate and fill the available phase space uniformly .",
    "more specifically , in the context of disordered mesoscopic systems the ergodic limit is reached for times larger than the diffusion time @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is the diffusion constant and @xmath5 the linear extension of the system . by the uncertainty relation ,",
    "the ergodic limit corresponds to the energy range below the thouless energy @xmath6 .",
    "one may ask whether the level statistics of disordered or chaotic single - particle systems in the ergodic limit must always be wigner - dyson or whether different statistics is possible .",
    "the answer is that wigner - dyson statistics is generic and universal as long as the statistics is required to be stationary under shifts of the energy .",
    "( this can be understood from the mapping on a nonlinear @xmath7 model@xcite . )",
    "however , if the stationarity condition is relaxed and additional symmetries are imposed , new universality classes may arise .",
    "this happens , for instance , when a massless dirac particle is placed in a random gauge field .",
    "because the dirac operator @xmath1 anticommutes with @xmath8 in the chiral ( or massless ) limit , its matrix is block off - diagonal in the eigenbasis of @xmath8 . as a result ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath1 are either zero or come in pairs @xmath9 .",
    "the average spectral density of @xmath1 close to zero is nonstationary but universal and is of relevance for the physics of qcd at low energies .",
    "it is determined by one of three so - called _ chiral _ gaussian ensembles , where different ensembles correspond to different choices of the gauge group and the number of flavors@xcite .",
    "these ensembles have appeared in the context of disordered single - electron systems , too@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we introduce and analyse four additional gaussian random - matrix ensembles , which share many striking similarities with the chiral ones but are demonstrably distinct .",
    "the universality classes they describe are realized in mesoscopic ns - systems , i.e. in microstructures composed of a metallic part in contact with one or several superconducting regions . just as in the classic wigner - dyson case",
    ", the universality classes are distinguished by their behavior under time reversal and rotation of the ( electron s ) spin .",
    "the four new classes together with the six known ones add up to a grand total of ten .",
    "we have reasons to believe that this exhausts the number of possible universality classes in disordered single - particle systems and none else will be found .",
    "( more precisely speaking , by universality classes we here mean infrared rg fixed points describing an ergodic limit . ) some of our ideas were anticipated in @xcite .",
    "the prototype of the kind of system we are going to study is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . a metallic ( i.e. normal - conducting ) quantum dot",
    "is put in contact , via potential barriers , with two superconducting regions .",
    "several leads are attached for the purpose of making current and voltage measurements .",
    "the metallic quantum dot may or may not be disordered . in the latter case",
    "we assume its geometric shape to be such that the classical motion of a single electron inside it is chaotic .",
    "the quantum dot may be pierced by a magnetic flux of the order of one or several flux quanta , and there may exist some impurity atoms causing spin - orbit scattering .",
    "the temperature is so low that the electron s phase coherence length exceeds the size of the quantum dot by far .",
    "the characteristic feature that distinguishes the above kind of quantum dot from more conventional mesoscopic systems , is the possibility for two electrons to tunnel through the potential barrier at the ns - interface , thereby adding a cooper pair to ( or removing it from ) the superconducting condensate .",
    "an equivalent statement in single - particle language is that an electron incident on the ns - interface may be retroreflected as a hole ( and vice versa ) .",
    "this process of particle - hole conversion , which conserves energy , momentum and spin but violates charge , is called _",
    "andreev reflection_. in the semiclassical limit , andreev reflections give rise to numerous almost - periodic orbits whose action does not grow but remains of order @xmath10 as the length of the orbit increases@xcite .",
    "the existence of these orbits modifies the mean density of states ( weyl term ) of the quantum dot without leads : in general , an excitation gap opens and we arrive at the `` boring '' situation where the vicinity of the chemical potential is devoid of single - particle states .",
    "however , by tuning the phase difference of the order parameters of the two superconducting regions to the special value @xmath11 , we can make the gap close .",
    "more generally , we expect quasiparticle excitations to exist right at the chemical potential whenever the phase shift incurred during andreev reflection vanishes on average over the ns - interfacial region . disorder or dynamically generated chaos mixes the states and creates a universal spectral region close to the chemical potential . its width is determined by the energy uncertainty which is caused by the coupling of particles and holes by andreev reflection .",
    "it is this very region and its consequences for the transport properties that we are going to study in the present paper .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "mesoscopic independent - quasiparticle systems are classified according to their behavior under time reversal and spin rotations in sec .",
    "[ sec : class ] .",
    "having specified the required dynamical input in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyn_input ] we formulate the appropriate random - matrix ensembles in sec .  [ sec : rme ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrum ] we discuss the spectral statistics of an isolated system , using first the dyson - mehta orthogonal polynomial method and then diagrammatic perturbation theory .",
    "the latter method easily extends to the calculation of the transport properties of an open system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wl ] we work out the weak localization correction to the average conductance and in sec .",
    "[ sec : ucf ] the universal conductance fluctuations .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the treatment of this paper is based on the bcs hamiltonian in the hartree - fock - boboliubov mean - field approximation : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is a scalar potential which may have a random component , and @xmath14 is the pairing field .",
    "the presence of a magnetic vector potential @xmath15 breaks time reversal symmetry while the spin - orbit field @xmath16 breaks invariance under rotations of the electron s spin .",
    "@xmath17 is the chemical potential .",
    "the second - quantized hamiltonian @xmath18 can be rewritten in an equivalent first - quantized form by the boboliubov - degennes ( bdg ) formalism . for our purposes",
    "it is convenient to introduce some generic orthonormal basis of single - electron states @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a multi - index that combines the orbital and spin quantum numbers of the electron .",
    "if @xmath21 is the number of orbital states used , @xmath20 runs from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be the usual creation and annihilation operators obeying the canonical anticommutation relations @xmath26 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath18 can be written @xmath27 hermiticity requires @xmath28 , and the matrix elements @xmath29 must be antisymmetric by fermi statistics : @xmath30 .",
    "now we write @xmath18 in the form `` row multiplies matrix multiplies column '' : @xmath31 in this way every hamiltonian @xmath18 is uniquely assigned to a @xmath32-matrix @xmath33 , @xmath34 the eigenvalue problem for @xmath33 is known as the bogoliubov - degennes equations .",
    "we refer to @xmath33 as the `` bdg - hamiltonian '' for short .",
    "the first - quantized hamiltonian @xmath33 acts in an enlarged space , namely the tensor product of the physical space @xmath35 ( orbitals and spin ) with an extra degree of freedom @xmath36 , which we call the `` particle - hole space '' .",
    "note however that the `` particles '' and `` holes '' of the bdg - formalism are not the particle and hole states of a degenerate fermi gas .",
    "indeed , the matrix @xmath37 already acts on _ all _ of the single - electron states , which have energies _ either above or below _ the chemical potential .",
    "the bdg - hole states acted upon by @xmath38 are identical ( and in this sense redundant , or unphysical ) copies of the bdg - particle states acted upon by @xmath37 .",
    "they are introduced for the convenience of treating the pairing field within the formalism of first quantization .",
    "the aim of the current section is to classify systems according to their symmetries . using the bdg - formalism",
    "we will show that the presence or absence of time - reversal and/or spin - rotation invariance leads to four distinct symmetry classes .",
    "the situation thus is different from the well - known wigner - dyson scenario where only three distinct classes exist .",
    "the discussion of secs .",
    "[ sec : scd]-[sec : sci ] uses some basic facts from the theory of lie algebras and symmetric spaces and is somewhat technical .",
    "the casual reader may wish to skip these subsections and proceed directly to table 1 given at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : sci ] .",
    "a brief summary of the symmetries of @xmath33 for each class is provided also at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ sec : rme ] .",
    "we start by considering systems with the least degree of symmetry , i.e. systems with neither time - reversal symmetry nor spin - rotation invariance . in this case",
    "the matrices @xmath37 and @xmath39 in general have no symmetry properties beyond those stated above , namely hermiticity of @xmath37 and skew - symmetry of @xmath39 . because the set of hermitian matrices does not close under commutation whereas the antihermitian ones do , we prefer to work with @xmath40 rather than @xmath33 in the current section . in terms of @xmath41 ,",
    "the conditions @xmath42 , @xmath43 can be presented summarily in the form @xmath44 if two matrices @xmath45 satisfy these equations , then so does their commutator @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "hence , we may view @xmath41 as an element of some lie algebra . to identify this lie algebra we conjugate by @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "equations ( [ orthogonal ] ) then take the form @xmath49 or , equivalently , @xmath50 .",
    "this shows that ( [ orthogonal ] ) fixes a @xmath51-algebra , i.e. a lie algebra isomorphic to the real antisymmetric @xmath32-matrices .",
    "since @xmath52 in cartan s notation , we denote the present symmetry class by the symbol `` @xmath1 '' .",
    "being a lie algebra element , @xmath41 can be brought into diagonal form by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an element of the corresponding lie group which is isomorphic to @xmath55 and is defined by @xmath56 the conditions ( [ orthogonal ] ) imply @xmath57 where @xmath58 with real @xmath59 .",
    "the conditions for the canonical anticommutation relations to be invariant under a transformation @xmath60 can be shown@xcite to coincide with ( [ orthogonal ] ) .",
    "thus , inserting @xmath61 into ( [ rmmmc ] ) we obtain @xmath62 with @xmath63 . the frequencies @xmath64 may be positive or negative .",
    "the bcs ground state is defined by demanding @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "the normal - ordered hamiltonian @xmath69 is always positive .",
    "we now consider systems without time - reversal symmetry but _ with _ spin - rotation invariance .",
    "we again use the unique representation of a second - quantized bcs mean - field hamiltonian @xmath18 by ( @xmath70 times ) a bdg - hamiltonian @xmath71 .",
    "we write the particle - hole decomposition of @xmath41 as @xmath72 or , in tensor - product notation , @xmath73 the condition @xmath74 means @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "antihermiticity requires @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the generators of spin rotations , @xmath80 @xmath81 , are represented on particle - hole space by @xmath82 .",
    "spin - rotation invariance of the hamiltonian requires that @xmath41 and @xmath80 commute .",
    "this condition is easily seen to constrain @xmath83 to be of the form @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 or , in matrix presentation , @xmath87 we see that @xmath41 decomposes into two commuting subblocks .",
    "one corresponds to spin - up particles and spin - down holes , and the other to spin - down particles and spin - up holes .",
    "because the subblocks are related by an algebra homomorphism ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) it is sufficient to focus on one of them , say @xmath90 and account for spin degeneracy by inserting factors of two whenever needed .",
    "we drop the subscript and write @xmath41 for @xmath91 .    since @xmath92 ,",
    "the equation @xmath85 implies @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , we deduce @xmath94 .",
    "antihermiticity requires @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "all these conditions are summarized by @xmath97 this is the defining equation of the symplectic lie algebra @xmath98 .",
    "thus @xmath71 is an element of @xmath99 . since @xmath100 in cartan s notation",
    ", we denote the present symmetry class by `` @xmath0 '' .",
    "the second - quantized hamiltonian associated with @xmath101 is @xmath102 as before , we can diagonalize @xmath41 by @xmath61 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and @xmath54 now satisfies @xmath105 , i.e. @xmath106 . the transformation @xmath107 diagonalizes the hamiltonian : @xmath108 because @xmath109 is a unitary matrix , the canonical anticommutation relations are preserved by the transformation from @xmath110 to @xmath111 .",
    "every quasiparticle level has a trivial degeneracy due to spin .",
    "we next consider systems with time - reversal symmetry but without spin - rotation invariance .",
    "recall that the conditions for symmetry class @xmath1 , @xmath112 with @xmath113 , fix a @xmath51-algebra .",
    "the time - reversal operator @xmath114 acts on the bdg - hamiltonian by @xmath115 where @xmath116 . using @xmath71 and @xmath117",
    "we get the action of @xmath114 on @xmath41 , @xmath118 .",
    "thus , for a time - reversal invariant system , @xmath41 is subject to the additional constraint @xmath119 .",
    "we denote the set of solutions in @xmath51 of this condition by @xmath120 .",
    "while @xmath120 does not close under commutation and therefore does not form a subalgebra of @xmath51 , the solution set , @xmath121 , of the complementary condition @xmath122 does .",
    "therefore , we may describe @xmath120 as the complement of a subalgebra @xmath121 in @xmath51 . in formulas , @xmath123 .",
    "we are now going to identify @xmath121 .",
    "the equations for @xmath121 can be rewritten @xmath124 let @xmath125 be the unitary matrix given in particle - hole and spin decomposition by @xmath126 conjugation by @xmath125 , @xmath127 , takes the equations for @xmath121 into @xmath128 the solutions of the latter are of the form @xmath129 with @xmath130 an antihermitian @xmath131-matrix .",
    "we now recognize @xmath121 as being isomorphic to the lie algebra of antihermitian @xmath132-matrices , or @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the space @xmath120 of bdg - hamiltonians @xmath71 is obtained from @xmath51 by removing a @xmath134-subalgebra . because @xmath120 is the difference of two lie algebras @xmath51 and @xmath134 ,",
    "it can be interpreted as the tangent space of the quotient @xmath135 of the corresponding lie groups , which is a symmetric space of type @xmath1iii in cartan s notation ; hence the name @xmath1iii for the present symmetry class .    from the general theory of symmetric spaces@xcite",
    "we know that an element @xmath136 can be diagonalized by a transformation @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "time - reversal symmetry causes every eigenvalue to be doubly degenerate by kramers theorem .",
    "finally , we turn to systems with both time - reversal symmetry and spin - rotation invariance .",
    "recall that spin - rotation invariance causes the bdg - hamiltonian @xmath139 to obey the relations @xmath140 , which define the symplectic lie algebra @xmath99 .",
    "because of the restriction to a single spin sector , the action of the time reversal operator simplifies to @xmath141 .",
    "thus , time - reversal symmetry constrains @xmath41 to be symmetric .",
    "let @xmath121 now denote the subalgebra of antisymmetric matrices in @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath41 , being symmetric , lies in the complementary set @xmath120 defined by @xmath142 .",
    "we claim that @xmath121 is isomorphic to the unitary lie algebra @xmath143 . to prove this",
    ", we observe that the solutions @xmath144 of @xmath145 have the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 is an arbitrary antihermitian @xmath148-matrix , i.e. @xmath149 . the embedding @xmath150 by @xmath151 is easily seen to be a homomorphism of lie algebras . therefore @xmath152 as claimed .",
    "the linear complement @xmath120 of @xmath143 in @xmath99 can be regarded as the tangent space of @xmath153 , which is a compact symmetric space of type @xmath0i according to cartan s list .    for the benefit of the casual reader",
    "the various symmetry classes and the names by which they are referred to in the present paper , are summarized in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + table 1      the symmetry ( [ orthogonal ] ) is central to our approach .",
    "just how robust is it ?",
    "the relations ( [ orthogonal ] ) follow from the well - known mathematical fact@xcite that the set of all bilinear combinations of the fermion creation and annilihation operators is isomorphic to an orthogonal lie algebra .",
    "put differently , the symmetry ( [ orthogonal ] ) requires no more than the fermionic nature of the electron and the use of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean - field approximation , allowing us to express the hamiltonian in terms of bilinears of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "alternatively , we could say that ( [ orthogonal ] ) is an exact symmetry whenever the system can be described in terms of independent boboliubov quasiparticles .",
    "what happens when we add a coulomb charging energy to the hamiltonian ?",
    "the relative minus sign between the particle - particle and hole - hole blocks of @xmath33 , eq .",
    "( [ bdg ] ) , tells us that , if the creation of an electron in a given state costs a certain amount of energy , then the creation of a hole ( removal of an electron ) in this state should release exactly the same amount .",
    "the coulomb interaction , however , does not conform to that principle .",
    "when a charge is added to a charge - neutral system , say , it makes no difference whether this charge is a particle or a hole , the electrostatic energy cost is positive in both cases .",
    "therefore , the coulomb charging energy ( as well as other perturbations that do not fit into the independent - quasiparticle framework ) violates the symmetry ( [ orthogonal ] ) .",
    "more precisely speaking , we expect the independent - quasiparticle approximation to be adequate for describing the short - time physics , but at sufficiently long times coulomb effects must become visible and , in particular , they will cut off the particle - hole modes we are going to study in the present paper . whether the cutoff time can be long enough for the consequences of the symmetry ( [ orthogonal ] ) to be observable , is a tough quantitative question for theory , which can not be answered without an understanding of screening in open and finite metallic systems .",
    "fortunately , the question has already been answered in the affirmative by experiment . over the last years",
    "a number of novel mesoscopic ns - phenomena has been observed , the most prominent of which is the dramatic enhancement@xcite of the differential conductance at zero bias in ns - geometries with a high potential barrier separating the normal - conducting and superconducting regions .",
    "this phenomenon has been explained@xcite by a mechanism called `` coherent andreev reflection '' or `` reflectionless tunneling''@xcite , which is the result of constructive interference between semiclassical paths with one andreev reflection and a variable number of normal reflections . in order for such an interference to take place",
    ", the dynamical phases of a particle and a hole traversing the same path in opposite directions must cancel each other .",
    "it is precisely the symmetry ( [ orthogonal ] ) in combination with the extra symmetries defining class @xmath0i , that guarantee the necessary phase relation between particles and holes to hold .",
    "we conclude that there exists convincing experimental evidence that the symmetry ( [ orthogonal ] ) is not wiped out by the coulomb interaction but leads to observable consequences . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we are going to ignore coulomb effects .",
    "the classification of sec .",
    "[ sec : class ] refers only to symmetry and thus is very general . to go further ,",
    "we make two dynamical assumptions .",
    "when an electron is retroreflected from the ns - interface as a hole , its wavefunction acquires a phase shift which is determined by the phase of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "our first assumption is that this phase shift , here called the `` andreev phase shift '' for short , _ vanishes on average over the ns - interfacial region_. to appreciate what such an assumption implies , let us look at a few examples .",
    "consider first an sns - system consisting of an infinite slab of normal metal sandwiched between two superconducting slabs @xmath154 and @xmath155 . the pairing interaction causes the existence of an excitation gap in each of the superconducting regions .",
    "we now ask how the presence of the normal - conducting slab affects the excitation spectrum of the combined sns - system at the chemical potential . the answer to this question",
    "was first given in@xcite and it is essentially as follows . in the clean limit ,",
    "the bdg - hamiltonian is separable and we can get a qualitative understanding of the quantal energy spectrum by the method of semiclassical quantization . for simplicity",
    "we assume that all reflections at the ns - interface are andreev .",
    "every periodic classical motion then is some multiple of a primitive periodic orbit where an electron moves back and forth between the superconducting regions and is andreev reflected at each interface . if @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) are the wave numbers of the particle ( hole ) normal to the slabs and @xmath5 is the thickness of the normal - conducting region , the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule applied to this periodic motion reads @xmath158 here @xmath159 is the phase accumulated by the two andreev reflections if @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the phases of the superconducting order parameter in the regions @xmath154 and @xmath155 . for an electron with energy equal to the fermi energy",
    ", @xmath156 equals @xmath157 , so the first term on the left - hand side vanishes . from the resulting equation @xmath162",
    "we see that the quantization condition can be fulfilled only when @xmath160 and @xmath161 differ by an odd multiple of @xmath11 . in other words , for @xmath163 , which includes the homogeneous case @xmath164",
    ", we expect a gap in the excitation spectrum not only in the superconductor but also in the combined sns - system . on the other hand , for @xmath165",
    "the gap closes and quasiparticle excitations exist all the way down to zero energy .",
    "the latter situation is special in that the andreev phase shift vanishes on average over the two ns - interfaces in that case .",
    "the above argument applies to the extreme limit of a clean system which clearly is unrealistic .",
    "what can we say about the effects of disorder ?",
    "a generic random potential destroys separability and makes bohr - sommerfeld quantization inapplicable .",
    "the general case therefore needs to be studied with the help of a computer , or by using the random - matrix theory that will be developed in the remainder of our paper . what is easy to treat analytically is the case of a slowly varying random potential depending only on the coordinate , @xmath166 , of the direction perpendicular to the slabs . in this case",
    "the quantization rule ( [ bs ] ) remains valid if we replace the expression @xmath167 by the integral @xmath168 where @xmath169^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath170^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath171 is the total energy of the electron . since @xmath172 for @xmath173 , our conclusions are the same as before : there is a gap for @xmath174 , and the gap closes as @xmath175 .",
    "another instructive example is provided by the vortex solution for a clean type - ii superconductor .",
    "the phase of the superconducting order parameter uniformly winds once around the unit circle as we go once around the vortex core . for this reason ,",
    "the pairing field experienced by normal excitations bound to the vortex core vanishes on average over the vortex .",
    "because the vortex solution breaks translational symmetry , there must exist some rpa ( or vibrational ) zero modes of the vortex .",
    "these zero modes are the goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry by the localized vortex solution .",
    "it follows that , if the rpa correlation energy vanishes ( is small ) , i.e. if the excitation energies are given by ( are approximately given by ) sums of two quasiparticle energies , there must exist quasiparticle excitations with vanishing ( small ) energy .",
    "in contrast , for a piece of cylindrically shaped normal metal immersed in a superconducting environment ( `` columnar defect '' ) there is no general reason why we should expect quasiparticle excitations with low energy .",
    "these two examples , the sns slab geometry and the vortex , lend support to the plausible expectation that a pairing field which is locally nonzero but whose mean phase @xmath176 vanishes in a suitably defined sense , is ineffective at creating a genuine gap in the density of states near the chemical potential .",
    "this then is the motivation behind the above requirement that the andreev phase shift should vanish on average over the ns - interfacial region : it ensures that the gap closes and quasiparticles can exist right at the chemical potential .",
    "our second main input is the assumption that _ the classical dynamics in the normal - conducting ( n- ) region be chaotic_. the presence of a sufficient amount of disorder will always guarantee this assumption to be justified . for a ballistic system , chaotic dynamics",
    "is achieved by choosing for the boundary of the n - region some surface that causes a typical classical trajectory to be unstable .",
    "chaoticity of the classical motion means that the long - time behavior of the system is unpredictable ; in particular , the phase shifts acquired by andreev reflection along a typical semiclassical trajectory form a random sequence . this randomness will allow us to model the pairing field by a stochastic variable .",
    "note that the spatial constancy of the magnitude of the pairing field in the bulk of the superconductor is an irrelevant feature for our purposes .",
    "if we switch from coordinate representation to a generic basis of single - particle states , say the eigenbases of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , both the phase and the magnitude of @xmath39 will fluctuate and be distributed around zero .",
    "consider now an isolated finite system , so that the boboliubov quasiparticle spectrum is discrete . according to our above arguments",
    ", we expect the existence of levels close to the chemical potential in the pure system under the conditions described .",
    "the effect of dynamically generated chaos and/or disorder will be to cause mixing of these levels .",
    "for the conventional n - system , such mixing is known to lead to universal level statistics , depending only on symmetry .",
    "( more precisely , the level correlations are universal in the low - frequency regime corresponding to the long - time or ergodic limit . ) for the case of disordered metallic granules , the level correlations were calculated by efetov@xcite .",
    "his results show that the level statistics is wigner - dyson , i.e. identical to that of an ensemble of random matrices with uncorrelated gaussian distributed matrix elements . in the ns - systems considered in the present paper , new features appear at low excitation energy , owing to the coupling of particles and holes by the process of andreev reflection at the ns - interface . as was shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : class ] , the presence of the pairing field @xmath39 leads to novel symmetries .",
    "we therefore expect new types of universal level statistics to emerge in such systems",
    ". the new type of correlation will extend over an energy range set by the energy uncertainty due to the action of the pairing field ( or andreev reflection ) .",
    "the goal of our paper is to give a quantitative description of precisely these correlations and their effect on the transport properties . to reach this goal",
    "we may follow two different routes .",
    "the first and more comprehensive one is to generalize efetov s analysis , i.e. to construct an effective field theory of the nonlinear @xmath7 model type and solve the field theory in the zero - dimensional limit corresponding to the universal regime .",
    "such an approach yields not only the universal behavior but also the crossover to the short - time regimes .",

    "our key technical step is the decomposition ( [ decompose ] ) which leads to an organization of the perturbation - theory diagrams by _ symmetry_. in the preceding subsection we discussed how the contractions @xmath318 and @xmath343 generate singular geometric series of ladder diagrams . in the same way ,",
    "every one of the other contractions gives rise to one singular ladder .",
    "these singular modes can be visualized as follows : @xmath344 the dotted vertical lines represent both impurity scatterings and andreev reflections , and they denote any one of the eight contractions @xmath345 ( @xmath346 ; @xmath347 ; @xmath348 ) .",
    "the type of contraction is invariant within one ladder .",
    "the @xmath147-type modes are built from states of identical charge ( two bdg - particles or two bdg - holes ) propagating on opposite segments of the ladder , whereas the @xmath1-type modes are built from charge - reversed states ( one particle and one hole ) .",
    "the former are singular in the @xmath349 channel , the latter in the @xmath334 ( or @xmath350 ) channel .",
    "the arrows on the green s function lines indicate the order in which single - particle states are visited . for the cooperon modes",
    "the order on both lines is the same , while for the diffuson modes it is reversed . in the limit @xmath351 ( with @xmath352 ) all modes are singular , or massless .",
    "the @xmath1-type modes are made massive by frequency ( or voltage ) @xmath225 while the @xmath147-type modes are insensitive to such a perturbation .",
    "the @xmath147-type cooperon and the @xmath1-type diffuson are made massive by the breaking of time - reversal symmetry . since a green s function line carries spin 1/2",
    ", the modes decompose into spin - singlet and spin - triplet ones .",
    "the spin - triplet modes are sensitive to spin - orbit scattering while the spin - singlet modes are not .",
    "we wish to mention that there is some redundancy in our classification of modes , as the basic particle - hole symmetry ( [ orthogonal ] ) causes the existence of certain relations among the matrix elements of the gorkov green s function @xmath353 .",
    "in particular , the particle - particle and hole - hole matrix elements are related by @xmath354 similarly , @xmath355 .",
    "these identities transcribe into relations connecting the singular modes . for example , by using ( [ ph - relate ] ) on one of the green s function lines of the @xmath1-type cooperon , we can make this mode look like the @xmath147-type diffuson , at the expense of having to change the sign of one frequency @xmath356 . in a similar way , the @xmath1-type diffuson is related to the @xmath147-type cooperon ( again with a sign change in one of the frequencies ) . in spite of that",
    ", we prefer to treat the @xmath147- and @xmath1-type modes as separate entities .",
    "the main reason for doing so is that they respond differently to translations of the energy : while the @xmath1-type modes are made massive by shifting the energy , the @xmath147-type modes are not .    in the present paper",

    "( iii ) although we have outlined the semiclassical interpretation of the @xmath1-type ( or particle - hole ) modes , a more detailed discussion of their role in semiclassical periodic - orbit theory would certainly be desirable . ( iv )",
    "we need to extend our results for the universal conductance fluctuations to the classes @xmath0i and @xmath1iii and to arbitrary @xmath389 .",
    "( v ) while the zero - dimensional ( or ergodic ) limit is adequately described by the maximum - entropy ansatz , the diffusive and ballistic regimes necessitate a more detailed modelling . in particular , the nonrandom nature of the magnitude of the pairing field will make itself felt at short times .",
    "it is an open technical problem how to deal analytically with the phase randomness of hamiltonian matrix elements when their magnitude is to be kept fixed .",
    "( vi ) we have concentrated on an ns - geometry that is particularly easy to treat but future work will have to include other geometries .",
    "( vii ) last but not least , we need to address the nontrivial question : how large is the effect of residual coulomb interactions on the @xmath1-type modes ? there is no doubt that the short - time physics can be adequately described in a simple independent - quasiparticle picture , but at large times the coherence between particles and holes will get cut off by coulomb blockade and other correlation effects .",
    "the question is what is the time scale where this happens .",
    "we shall end on a mathematical note . according to cartan , there exist eleven large families of symmetric spaces .",
    "those of type ii are the compact unitary , orthogonal and symplectic lie groups @xmath453 .",
    "the large families of type - i symmetric spaces are denoted by @xmath147i , @xmath147ii , @xmath147iii , @xmath454i , @xmath0i , @xmath0ii , and @xmath1iii .",
    "the standard wigner - dyson universality classes derive from @xmath147 ( gue ) , @xmath147i ( goe ) , and @xmath147ii ( gse ) , while the universality classes of a massless dirac particle derive from @xmath147iii ( chgue ) , @xmath454i ( chgoe ) , and @xmath0ii ( chgse ) . as we have shown , the new universality classes found in mesoscopic ns - systems exhaust the remaining large families of symmetric spaces except for @xmath180 ( the orthogonal group in odd dimensions ) , which does not occur .",
