    "it is known that chiral symmetry plays a key role , and computationally the large @xmath2 and large @xmath3 limits must be addressed carefully @xcite . a @xmath0-dimensional version of the njl model , the @xmath1 model [ also known as the _ chiral _ gross - neveu model , @xmath4 is of interest because it captures some important features of qcd , such as asymptotic freedom , dynamical mass generation , a large @xmath2 limit , and the breaking of a continuous chiral symmetry @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the exact crystalline solutions to the associated gap equation , found recently in @xcite , to study the temperature - density phase diagram of this @xmath1 system .",
    "the result of our thermodynamical analysis confirms the physical picture proposed in @xcite that there is a phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath5 from a massless phase to a broken phase with a helical condensate ( the `` chiral spiral '' ) , of the complex larkin - ovchinikov - fulde - ferrell ( loff ) form . the resulting phase diagram",
    "[ see below , figure [ fig5 ] ] , is very different from that of the non - chiral gross - neveu ( @xmath6 ) model , which has just a discrete , rather than continuous , chiral symmetry . in the @xmath6 model",
    "there is also a region of the phase diagram with a crystalline order parameter @xcite , but the structure of the phase diagram is very different [ see below , figure [ fig7 ] ] .",
    "this crystalline phase of @xmath6 has been clearly seen in a recent lattice analysis @xcite , extending an important earlier lattice analysis @xcite . in this paper",

    "of course , finding inhomogeneous solutions to the gap equation is a much more difficult technical problem , but the massless @xmath1 and @xmath6 models have remarkable symmetry properties that enable one to find the general periodic condensate solutions @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , in one spatial dimension it is possible to find the most general bounded quasi - periodic solution to this gap equation @xcite .",
    "the general solution has the form of a `` twisted kink crystal '' , described below .",
    "a useful quantity for solving the inhomogeneous gap equation ( [ gap1 ] ) is the resolvent @xmath29 , the coincident - point limit of the gorkov green s function @xmath30 corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) @xmath31 for a _",
    "static _ condensate the gap equation ( [ gap1 ] ) can be written as @xmath32 \\label{gap2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solution of the gap equation relies on the remarkable fact that in one spatial dimension the resolvent ( itself a @xmath33 matrix ) must satisfy a simple first order matrix differential equation @xmath34 \\label{dikii}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is known as the eilenberger equation in the superconductivity literature @xcite , and as the dickey equation in mathematical physics @xcite .",
    "the dickey - eilenberger equation follows immediately from the fact that the resolvent can be written as a product of two linearly independent solutions : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the wronskian of two independent solutions @xmath37 of @xmath38 .",
    "the inhomogeneous gap equation ( [ gap1 ] ) can be solved by the following simple ansatz @xcite for the resolvent @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are functions of the energy @xmath43 , and are to be determined .",
    "this particular ansatz is motivated by the gap equation ( [ gap2 ] ) that relates the off - diagonal component of the resolvent with @xmath16 .",
    "the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) automatically solves the diagonal part of the eilenberger equation ( [ dikii ] ) , while the off - diagonal part requires that the condensate field @xmath16 satisfy the complex nonlinear scrdinger equation ( nlse ) : @xmath44 the advantage of this ansatz approach is that the nlse ( [ nlse ] ) can be solved in closed form , and its general solution has the form of a twisted kink crystal , described in detail in @xcite and summarized below in the next section . the associated energy functions @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are simple functions of @xmath43 . for the @xmath1 model",
    ", there is a further consistency condition required to satisfy the gap equation ( [ gap2 ] ) : for an inhomogeneous condensate , the part of the off - diagonal resolvent proportional to @xmath45 must vanish .",
    "this places a condition on the energy function @xmath40 : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the inverse temperature and @xmath48 is the chemical potential .",
    "this consistency condition imposes one relation on the parameters describing the twisted kink solution . with this consistency condition imposed ,",
    "the general inhomogeneous condensate @xmath28 satisfying the nlse ( [ nlse ] ) solves the gap equation ( [ gap1 ] ) .",
    "given this exact solution @xmath28 to the gap equation ( [ gap1 ] ) , it is also possible to find the exact single - particle solutions to the bdg equation ( [ bdg ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the diagonal resolvent @xmath29 in ( [ ansatz ] ) encodes all the relevant spectral information .",
    "for example , the local density of states for fermions in the presence of the condensate is given by @xmath49 where the matrix trace of the resolvent follows trivially from the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) : @xmath50 given the density of states @xmath51 , all relevant thermodynamic quantities , at finite temperature and chemical potential , can be derived from the grand canonical potential @xmath52= -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}de\\,\\rho(e)\\ln\\left(1+e^{-\\beta(e-\\mu ) } \\right ) + \\frac{1}{2{n_f}g^2 } \\frac{1}{l } \\int_0^l dx |\\delta(x)|^2 \\quad .",
    "\\label{grand}\\ ] ] since we know @xmath53 exactly , we can analyze the thermodynamical properties of this model precisely .",
    "the general solution to the nlse ( [ nlse ] ) describes a crystalline condensate @xcite .",
    "it is a periodic array of kinks that also rotate in the chiral plane , as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the _ single _ chirally - twisted kink was originally found by shei @xcite using inverse scattering techniques , and subsequently studied in a resolvent approach by feinberg and zee @xcite .",
    "the periodic array of such twisted kinks can be expressed in terms of the elliptic functions : @xmath54   \\quad   \\label{complex - kink - crystal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ) , shown as the red curve .",
    "the blue skeleton surface is shown just to illustrate the periodic amplitude modulation and phase winding . ]    where sc = sn / cn , nd=1/dn are jacobi elliptic functions , and the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the weierstrass sigma and zeta functions @xcite , chosen to have real and imaginary half - periods : @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "both periods are therefore controlled by a single [ real ] elliptic parameter @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath60 is pure imaginary .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 sets the overall scale of the condensate , and @xmath62 sets the length scale of the crystal .",
    "later , we will use units in which the vacuum mass of the fermion is @xmath63 , so that @xmath61 sets the scale relative to the vacuum fermion mass .",
    "the angular parameter @xmath64 takes values in the range @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "the [ real ] constant @xmath66 is a function of @xmath64 and the elliptic parameter @xmath67 : @xmath68 for brevity we will usually suppress the explicit dependence of the elliptic functions on the elliptic parameter @xmath67 . the final parameter @xmath69 is a phase parameter that affects the chiral angle through which the condensate rotates over one period @xmath70 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is real .",
    "thus the general solution is specified by four real parameters : a scale parameter @xmath61 , a phase parameter @xmath69 , an angular parameter @xmath64 , and the elliptic parameter @xmath67 .",
    "these parameters also parametrize the energy spectrum of fermions in such a condensate background , which has two gaps , with band edges @xmath73 as shown in the first plot of figure [ fig2 ] :    , showing the central value @xmath74 , and the band edges @xmath75 , for @xmath76 .",
    "the second figure shows the special case of the spiral condensate , for which the bound band merges with one of the continua .",
    "the third figure shows the spectrum for another special case , the real kink crystal , which has a charge conjugation symmetry , implying that the offset is @xmath77 , and the spectrum is symmetric about 0 .",

    "the position of the bands within the gap , and their width , are controlled by the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath67.,title=\"fig : \" ]    @xmath78    thus , in terms of the single particle fermion spectrum , the role of the four parameters is as follows : @xmath61 determines the overall energy scale ; @xmath69 determines the overall offset ; while @xmath64 and @xmath67 determine the location and width of the band that lies in the gap between the `` outer '' edges @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the simple linear dependence of the energy spectrum on the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath69 is a direct consequence of the form of the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) , and reflects the an important scale and shift symmetry described in detail in section [ sec : scale ] .    for the twisted kink crystal solution ( [ complex - kink - crystal ] ) , the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the nlse ( [ nlse ] )",
    "are simple polynomials of @xmath43 , with coefficients determined by the band edges : @xmath81 furthermore , the energy function @xmath40 appearing in the resolvent ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) also has a very simple form in terms of the band edges : @xmath82 thus , we have an explicit exact expression for the density of states of fermions in the presence of such a twisted kink condensate field , following from the trace of the resolvent . within the bands : @xmath83 here we have defined the function @xmath84 in terms of the normalized average of @xmath85 over one period : @xmath86 with @xmath87 being the weierstrass @xmath87 function .",
    "thus , the density of states @xmath53 is an explicitly known function of the energy @xmath43 , depending parametrically on the four parameters @xmath61 , @xmath69 , @xmath64 and @xmath67 that characterize the solution ( [ complex - kink - crystal ] ) to the gap equation .",
    "this parametric dependence enters through the band edge energies @xmath75 in ( [ band_edges ] ) , and through the function @xmath88 defined in ( [ zed ] ) .",
    "an important special case of the general solution ( [ complex - kink - crystal ] ) is the degenerate case when the bound band of the fermion spectrum shrinks and merges with the upper or lower continuum , so that the spectrum has just a single gap , as shown in the second plot in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this occurs when the angular parameter takes values at its extreme limits : @xmath89 [ which implies that @xmath90 , so that the bound band merges with the upper continuum ] , or @xmath91 [ which implies that @xmath92 , so that the bound band merges with the lower continuum ] .",
    "the general twisted kink crystal condensate ( [ complex - kink - crystal ] ) reduces to a single plane wave @xmath93    ) , shown as the red curve .",
    "the blue skeleton surface is shown just to illustrate the periodic phase winding .",
    "in contrast to the twisted kink crystal in figure [ fig1 ] , for the spiral , the amplitude is constant . ]    which is clearly a solution to the nlse ( [ nlse ] ) . for this condensate",
    "the amplitude is constant , while the phase rotates at a constant rate , set by @xmath69 , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the fermion energy spectrum has just one gap , of width @xmath94 , centered at @xmath69 ; that is , the band edges lie at @xmath95 , and @xmath96 . correspondingly , the resolvent trace has a simplified form , and the spectral function within the continuum bands is simply : @xmath97 which we recognize as the spectral function of a constant condensate @xmath98 , shifted in energy by @xmath69 .",
    "another important special case of the general solution ( [ complex - kink - crystal ] ) is the case where the condensate is real [ relevant for the @xmath6 model ] , which implies that the bdg hamiltonian @xmath99 in ( [ ham2 ] ) has a charge - conjugation symmetry , @xmath100 , which in turn implies that the fermionic spectrum is symmetric , as shown in the third plot of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the band edges reduce to @xmath101    ) , shown as the red curve .",
    "the blue skeleton surface is shown just to illustrate the periodic amplitude modulation and phase winding .",
    "for this real kink crystal , the amplitude vanishes each period , and the kink rotates through @xmath102 [ i.e. , changes sign ] each period . ]",
    "the phase parameter @xmath77 , and further the angular parameter @xmath64 takes its midpoint value @xmath103 .",
    "thus the real kink crystal is described by just two parameters , the scale @xmath61 and the elliptic parameter @xmath67 : @xmath104 the second form of @xmath28 in ( [ real - kink - crystal ] ) is obtained from the first form by a landen transformation @xcite . over one period , @xmath105 , the condensate changes sign",
    "[ that is , it rotates through an angle @xmath106 , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "this change of sign corresponds to the _ discrete _ chiral symmetry of the @xmath6 model , while the phase rotation ( [ winding ] ) of the general kink crystal condensate ( [ complex - kink - crystal ] ) is associated with the _ continuous _ chiral symmetry of the @xmath1 model .",
    "the real kink crystal describes the inhomogeneous condensate of the crystalline phase of the @xmath6 model @xcite , and its thermodynamics will be discussed below in section    [ sec : gn ] .",
    "in this section we describe a simple but important symmetry property of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation ( [ bdg ] ) , that has important consequences for the thermodynamical analysis . the bogoliubov - de gennes equation ( [ bdg ] ) admits a family of solutions obtained by rescaling and phase shifting ( i.e. making a _ linear _ local chiral rotation ) a given solution : @xmath107 which generates all the linear transformations acting on the energy spectrum : @xmath108 in terms of the density of states , the effect of the transformation is : @xmath109 the important physical implication of this symmetry is that when minimizing the grand potential ( [ grand ] ) with respect to the four parameters @xmath61 , @xmath69 , @xmath64 and @xmath67 , the minimization with respect to @xmath61 and @xmath69 can be done first .",
    "if the grand potential did not require renormalization , then the minimization with respect to @xmath61 and @xmath69 would be trivial .",
    "in fact , we will show in the next section that even taking into account the renormalization , these symmetries greatly simplify the minimization with respect to @xmath61 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is useful to define the `` unscaled '' and `` unshifted '' spectrum to be the one with @xmath110 and @xmath77 , so that @xmath111 , and @xmath112 ( in units where the vacuum fermion mass is 1 ) .",
    "all other spectral functions can be generated from this basic solution using the simple transformation ( [ rho - trans ] ) .",
    "the corresponding density of states will be written as @xmath113 where @xmath114 is defined in ( [ zed ] ) , and @xmath115 importantly , @xmath116 depends parametrically only on the two remaining parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath67 .",
    "this separation of parametric dependences has important consequences for the minimization of the thermodynamic grand potential ( [ grand ] ) with respect to the parameters .",
    "we begin our discussion with the grand canonical potential @xmath118 $ ] for the unscaled / unshifted condensate @xmath119 , obtained from ( [ complex - kink - crystal ] ) by setting the scale parameter @xmath110 , and the phase parameter @xmath77 .",
    "the grand potential is formally divergent in the uv region and has to be renormalized , as is well known @xcite . at finite density and nonzero temperature , it is convenient to separate the single particle contribution as @xmath120 where @xmath121 , in terms of the momentum cutoff @xmath122 .",
    "only the first term , the zero temperature expression , in ( [ split ] ) is divergent .",
    "we isolate the divergent terms using the large @xmath43 behaviour of the density of states ( [ bare - dos ] ) : @xmath123 the divergent part is @xmath124 the quadratically and linearly divergent terms are absorbed by definition of the renormalized energy and baryon number densities , and the logarithmically divergent term is canceled by the double counting correction @xcite @xmath125 where we have used vacuum gap equation @xmath126 .",

    "all we need to know is the effect of the transformation ( [ energy - trans ] ) on @xmath40 . from the form of ( [ n - njl ] )",
    "it is clear that @xmath163 where @xmath164 hence we can write the consistency condition as @xmath165 note that this integral is finite , even at @xmath166 , and no renormalization is required .",

    "before studying the general twisted kink crystal condensate , we investigate the thermodynamics of the special case of the spiral condensate : @xmath167 for this condensate , @xmath168 , ( i.e. , the vacuum fermion mass in our units ) , and so the thermodynamics is simply that of a constant condensate of unit magnitude .",

    "the spiral condensate ( [ spiral ] ) is the `` chiral spiral '' solution proposed in @xcite . at nonzero temperature",
    ", the @xmath69 minimization condition ( [ q_min1 ] ) can be written explicitly as @xmath177 at low temperatures , @xmath178 , the main contribution to the energy integrals in ( [ q_min_spiral ] ) comes from near the upper band edge @xmath179 .",
    "so we approximate the density of states as : @xmath180 and ( [ q_min_spiral ] ) becomes @xmath181 this also requires @xmath173=0 , leading again to the chiral spiral solution with @xmath176 .",
    "indeed , it is easy to verify numerically that the finite temperature equation ( [ q_min_spiral ] ) has a solution only at @xmath175 , for all temperature @xmath162 .",
    "another argument in favor of @xmath182 at all temperatures is that instead of minimizing with respect to @xmath69 , we can minimize with respect to @xmath173 .",

    "can easily be seen by looking at the sign of the 2nd derivative ( taylor expansion of the integrand ) .",
    "other minima ( which could only come in pairs ) are ruled out numerically .",
    "thus , we conclude that the minimization of the grand potential with respect to the phase parameter @xmath69 leads to @xmath176 for all temperature @xmath162 , so @xmath48 always lies at the center of the gap .",
    "as should be clear from this discussion , this fact can be traced directly to the phase transformation symmetry in ( [ trans ] ) .",
    "another immediate consequence of @xmath176 is that the grand potential for the chiral spiral has a simple @xmath48 dependence .",

    "in this section we develop results for the thermodynamics of the @xmath1 model with the twisted kink crystal condensate , that is the general solution of the inhomogeneous gap equation .",
    "recall that the twisted kink crystal condensate ( [ complex - kink - crystal ] ) is characterized by 4 parameters : the scale parameter @xmath61 , the phase parameter @xmath69 , an angular parameter @xmath64 , and the elliptic parameter @xmath67 .",
    "we first consider the situation analytically at @xmath166 , then at nonzero @xmath162 .      at @xmath166",
    "there are some significant simplifications .",
    "first of all , the fermi factor becomes a step function that acts as a cutoff of the energy integrals .",
    "thus , in the consistency condition ( [ cc2 ] ) , we use @xmath212 if we assume that @xmath148 is in the upper gap , then both the lower continuum and the bound band are completely filled .",
    "thus the consistency condition ( [ cc2 ] ) reads ( for details , see",

    "@xmath240 in the small @xmath162 limit , the continuum integrals are dominated by the region @xmath241 ( i.e near the band edges ) .",
    "the spectral function around the band edges has the behavior : @xmath242 note that the lower continuum leads to an o(@xmath243 ) correction , while the upper continuum leads to an o(@xmath244 ) correction .",
    "the band integral also leads to an o(@xmath243 ) correction .",
    "this can be seen by changing the integration variable @xmath245 : @xmath246 an important observation is that this function @xmath247 for all @xmath248 $ ] .",
    "finally , we use the general transformation of the grand potential ( [ psi_trans ] ) to deduce the grand potential for the twisted kink crystal .",
    "since after minimization , @xmath249 , the small @xmath162 correction to @xmath61 does not contribute to the full grand potential @xmath117 ( as in ( [ cs - low - t ] ) ) , and the full grand potential is found to be : @xmath250 the first term in parentheses is just the low @xmath162 grand potential for the chiral spiral , as in ( [ cs - low - t ] ) .",
    "since @xmath251 is always negative , and @xmath252 is always positive , we see that the system is unstable with respect to the opening of a gap near the lower continuum edge . in other words , at small @xmath162 the minimization of the grand potential reduces the general twisted kink crystal condensate to the chiral spiral condensate , just as at @xmath166 .",
    "the previous two sections have shown that at @xmath166 and for small @xmath162 , the chiral spiral condensate is the thermodynamically preferred form of the more general twisted kink crystal condensate .",
    "we have also checked this conclusion numerically at various locations on the phase diagram , and we find that throughout the phase diagram the chiral spiral is the thermodynamically preferred limit of the general twisted kink crystal solution of the inhomogeneous gap equation .",
    "the phase diagram of the @xmath6 model , which has just a _ discrete _ chiral symmetry instead of the _ continuous _ chiral symmetry of the @xmath1 model , is by now well understood @xcite .",
    "but we revisit it here briefly , with a new perspective .",
    "the analysis of this paper shows that the key to understanding the phase diagram of the @xmath1 model is the behavior ( [ psi_trans ] ) of the renormalized grand potential under the rescaling and shifting transformation ( [ trans ] ) .",
    "but in the @xmath6 model there is no pseudoscalar interaction , so the condensate is real .",

    "the angular parameter @xmath64 in the solution ( [ complex - kink - crystal ] ) of the inhomogeneous gap equation is also zero , as the condensate can not wind by an arbitrary phase as it goes through one period .",
    "furthermore , there is no need to impose any consistency condition on the solution of the gap equation : since the pseudoscalar condensate @xmath14 is identically zero , there is no condition arising from its variation , which means that the off - diagonal terms in ( [ gap2 ] ) play no role .     model .",
