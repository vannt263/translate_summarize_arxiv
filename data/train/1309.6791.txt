    "the landau theory of second order phase transitions ( pt-2 ) was offered in the middles of previous century @xcite , but interest to it does not weaken to the present , for example , in phase fields theories @xcite . by more",
    "late researches in the theory of pt-2 very important one - valued connection was set up between the order parameter ( @xmath0 ) and the configurational entropy @xcite .",
    "such connection allows choosing as an independent variable one of them .",
    "pt-2 was based traditionally on the use of @xmath0 , but a variant will be first considered here , in basis of which as an independent variable configurational entropy is fixed .",
    "let s set the free energy functional @xmath1 for the non - equilibrium state of the system with given @xmath0 @xmath2 in a form typical for pt-2 @xcite @xmath3dv.\\ ] ]    free energy is here presented , actually , as expansion of a functional @xmath1 in a series over the small @xmath2 and its spatial derivatives .",
    "the first term in square brackets is energy of the heterogeneous distribution , @xmath4 is the external field .",
    "the type of dependence on the spatial derivate @xmath2 is dictated by considering of a homogeneous and isotropic system . in obedience to ideology of pt-2",
    "the free energy depends on a temperature , however its dependence on a temperature is concentrated only in a coefficient @xmath5 , which besides changes a sign in a critical point .",
    "it is considered that other coefficients do not depend on a temperature at all .    for a homogeneous case @xmath6    here and below the extensive thermodynamic variables",
    "are designated by large characters @xmath7 , @xmath8 et cetera , and their densities are designated by small characters @xmath9 , @xmath10 et cetera .    a derivative of the free energy on the temperature differs from entropy by a sign only . as the coefficient @xmath5 depends on temperature only , than differentiating ( [ b2 ] ) , we get @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath10 is entropy density , @xmath12 is a critical temperature , the constant @xmath13 does not depend on a temperature , and is determined by a relation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the absolute temperature ( thermostate ) .",
    "actually , @xmath10 is not total entropy , but its configurational part only , as pure thermal effects in pt-2 are not explicitly considered .",
    "in addition , the relation ( [ b3 ] ) is not general , but a model .",
    "however within the framework of this model a one - valued connection between @xmath0 and the configurational entropy is established .",
    "it means that it is possible to choose one of these variables as an independent thermodynamic variable and to outline a theory of pt-2 , for example , not in terms of @xmath0 , but in terms of configurational entropy .",
    "besides , it prompts the idea for application of similar model relations in more wide area ( not only for pt-2 ) , including modeling of severe plastic deformation processes .",
    "we mark that a similar situation arises up in the theory of vacancies",
    ". there boltzmann offers a formula , uniquely relating the configurational entropy and the vacancy concentration that also allows choosing one of them as an independent variable @xcite .",
    "it is possible to conclude from it , that all three variables , configurational entropy , defect concentration and order parameter , in a different form characterize the same structural reality of solid , its defectiveness . in the case of phase transitions",
    "the defectiveness obviously can be related to the spontaneous origin of embryos of a new phase .    within the framework of this model relation it is possible to pass in accordance with expression @xmath16 from the configurational free energy to the internal energy and vice",
    "versa . here , to underline configurational nature of free energy and entropy ,",
    "they are supplied a lower index @xmath17 .    differentiating ( [ b5 ] ) we get useful relations @xmath18 from which follows @xmath19 by virtue of that the derivative of configurational entropy on temperature is the second derivative of the free energy on temperature , but the last depends linearly on the temperature .",
    "it is follows from there that both the configurational entropy and the internal energy do not explicitly depend on temperature .    using eqs .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b5 ] ) we find an explicit expression for the internal energy ( for a homogeneous case and without the account of the external field ) @xmath20 where already all coefficients do not depend on a temperature .",
    "it is possible to consider by virtue of generality of result that namely expression ( [ b8 ] ) is base model relation of theory of pt-2 , and temperature dependence of the coefficient @xmath5 ( [ b4 ] ) and the free energy ( [ b1 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] ) is simple consequence of this fact .",
    "indeed , let us consider that simple base relation for internal energy ( [ b8 ] ) , in which all of coefficients do not depend on a temperature , is initially given . in this case @xmath21 , and according to ( [ b7 ] ) @xmath22 too .",
    "then configurational entropy can be also presented as a series expansion on @xmath0 , limited here quadratic approaching only @xmath23    substituting it in eq .",

    "we mark that in area of small @xmath28 in ( [ b8 ] ) the first term prevails , and the internal energy has a maximum .",

    "the internal energy is convex ; it is concave in area of non - zero values of @xmath0 ( [ b13 ] ) .",
    "inflection points , dividing these areas , are deduced from a condition @xmath39 that gives a value @xmath40 ( dotted vertical line in fig.1 ) .",
    "now we compare positions of extremums of the internal and free energy .",
    "for the last they are determined from a condition @xmath41 and non - zero roots are equal @xmath42    from where we notice that at a zero temperature non - zero roots of the free and internal energy coincide ( their graphs coincide fully , see curve 1 in fig .",

    "we must take into account thus that in the equilibrium state the tangent to the graph of the free energy has a zero inclination by definition , while tangent to the graph of the internal energy has a non - zero inclination .",
    "then evolution equation in terms of the internal energy must look like @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the internal energy density , @xmath48 is a new kinetic coefficient , @xmath49 is chemical potentialin the equilibrium state .",

    "( [ b20 ] ) it is possible to check with help of fig . [ f3 ] , where the curves of the internal energy and its first two derivatives on @xmath0 are resulted only . for illustration",
    "the equilibrium states are chosen on the left and on the right of inflection point in area of convex and concavity of the internal energy .    if the system is in the non - equilibrium state @xmath57 ( dotted line on the right of @xmath50 in fig .",

    "thus , following connection between the configurational entropy and @xmath0 ( [ b3 ] ) , it was succeeded to set connection between the free and internal energy , and to find the alternative form of evolution equations in terms of the internal energy ( [ b20 ] ) . in an order to use evolution equation ( [ b20 ] )",
    "it is needed to know an equilibrium value of chemical potential . for its finding again all the same it is necessary to use a minimum of the free energy ( [ b16 ] ) , in which it is possible to calculate all of descriptions of the internal energy and its derivatives .",

    "the evolution equation ( [ b29 ] ) , following from functional of the internal energy ( [ b27 ] ) , as well as evolution equations , followings from functional of free energy ( [ b1 ] ) ( see @xcite ) can describe relaxation ( suppression ) of the heterogeneous field of fluctuations .",

    "this process is slow by virtue of dimension factor , long - living fluctuations are arisen . as the process of generation of fluctuations continues with same intensity , and the process of their suppression",
