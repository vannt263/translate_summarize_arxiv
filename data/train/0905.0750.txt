    "@xcite discussed the existence of blueshifted circumstellar cores in the spectrum of the red supergiant star @xmath1 her , constituting direct evidence for high rates of mass loss .",
    "since that time , numerous observations have elucidated the magnitude and ubiquity of mass loss across the upper right side of the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "the high rates of mass loss among agb stars rival evolutionary timescales , affecting stellar evolutionary tracks substantially .",
    "therefore , the high rates of mass loss deserve careful determination .",
    "these facts have befuddled theorists , who are struggling with the basic challenge of how to lift so much mass away from the gravitational hold of the star .    during the 1980 s , observations with the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) demonstrated that extended infrared shells of evolved stars - the anticipated effect of continuous dusty mass loss ( e.g.  @xcite ) - were present . during the 1990 s , the _ infrared space observatory _ and ground - based infrared work began to refine those results ( e.g.  @xcite ) , indicating variations in the mass loss rate over time and resulting in shells and structure as might be predicted in stellar evolution calculations for agb stars ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "this decade , we are fortunate to have higher resolution and sensitivity instruments like the _ akari infrared astronomy satellite _ ( _ akari _ : @xcite ) and the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( _ spitzer _ : @xcite ) that can more carefully map the mass loss history of evolved stars .",
    "this report is the first of several studies of well - resolved mass loss histories of agb stars under _ akari _ and _ spitzer _ observing programs labeled `` excavating mass loss history in extended dust shells of evolved stars ( mlhes ) '' . in this contribution",
    ", we will explore whether the detection of an extended ( @xmath2 radius ) dust shell around the oxygen - rich agb star , r cas , can be interpreted in terms of thermal pulses , in order to constrain mass loss histories from this evolved star . in parallel with the mass loss history of evolved stars , evidence for the interaction of circumstellar and interstellar medium ( ism )",
    "is growing , with new observations of bow shocks around r hya @xcite and mira @xcite , plus theoretical considerations of the phenomena @xcite .",
    "because nature is intrinsically complicated , we will examine evidence for both mass loss history and interaction with the ism in the case of the extended infrared shell of r cas .",
    "the mira type variable , r cas ( hd224490 ) , is an oxygen - rich star with a period of 431 days and estimated mass loss rate of 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "this star shows an extended circumstellar shell originally detected by _ iras _ at @xmath6 , having angular extent at least @xmath7 @xcite , or @xmath8 @xcite using careful deconvolution of the point - spread - function ( psf ) .",
    "the linear extent of the shell depends on the distance determination .",
    "we observed r cas in the four bands at 65 , 90 , 140 and @xmath9 using the far - infrared surveyor ( fis : @xcite ) on - board _ akari _ on 2007 january 16 as part of the mlhes mission program ( pi : i.  yamamura ) .",
    "observations were made with the fis01 ( compact source photometry ) scan mode , in which two strips of forward and backward scans ( at @xmath10s reset rate ) were done with a 70@xmath11 spacing .",
    "r cas was also observed at @xmath12 using mips aboard _",
    "on 2008 february 18 as part of the cycle 4 go project , _ spitzer_-mlhes ( pid 40092 , pi : t.  ueta ) .",
    "we mapped a @xmath13 region with a series of exposures in photometry / fixed - cluster - offset mode , while avoiding the central star that is brighter than the saturation limit of the mips arrays .",
    "figure [ fig : rcas ] shows a _ spitzer _",
    "image at @xmath12 ( top left ) and _ akari _ images at 90 and @xmath14 ( top middle and right , respectively ) .",
    "these far - infrared images show the extended circumstellar shell around r cas , which is roughly circular of radius 140 to @xmath15 .",
    "the shell s emission structure consists of the relatively flat `` plateau '' region on the west side ( of surface brightness @xmath16 to 20 mjy sr@xmath5 at 65 to 90@xmath17 m and @xmath18 mjy sr@xmath5 at 140@xmath17 m ) and the region of higher surface brightness ( emission core ) on the east side around the central star .",
    "we immediately see that the extended shell is off - centered , i.e. , position of the central star does not coincide with the geometric center of the extended circular shell .",
    "also , there appears to be an enhancement of the surface brightness along the periphery of the shell ( especially recognizable in the _ spitzer _ @xmath12 and the dust temperature maps ) .",
    "this density enhancement may be due to a fast low density wind shock - merging with a slower , high density wind which was caused during an era of higher / enhanced mass loss , as has been hydrodynamically predicted ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "_ hipparcos _ measured the proper motion of @xmath19 mas yr@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this translates to the position angle of @xmath20 east of north , which is indicated as a line drawn from the position of the star in figure [ fig : rcas ] .",
    "this direction agrees remarkably well with the direction along which there is a positive gradient of surface brightness . in other words , the brighter surface brightness in the eastern edge of the shell appears to arise from interactions between agb winds and the ism , where a bow shock is expected as discovered around another agb star , r hya @xcite .",
    "the shape of the circumstellar shell was fit by an ellipse .",
    "the best - fit semi - major axis and eccentricity pair , @xmath21 , is @xmath22 pix @xmath23 and @xmath24 : indeed , the r cas shell is not quite circular in projection . according to the best - fit ellipse , the distance from the ellipse center to one of the foci is @xmath25 pix @xmath26 .",
    "this means that the central star is @xmath27 displaced from the ellipse center over the course of the shell expansion . at the preferred distance for r cas , 176 pc ,",
    "the semi - major and semi - minor axes correspond to 0.12 to 0.14 pc . at the measured co expansion rate of 12 km",
    "s@xmath5 @xcite , a crossing time of the shell is therefore roughly @xmath28 years .",
    "if the elongation of the r cas shell is solely due to the motion of the central star with respect to the shell ( in an otherwise stationary local environment ) , the star must have been moving roughly at 5 mas yr@xmath5 , which is much smaller than the observed motion of 86.5 mas yr@xmath5 .",
    "thus , the shaping of the shell is not self - inflicted as in interactions between fast and slow agb winds expected in the agb shells @xcite .",
    "rather , the shall shaping appears to be a result of interactions between agb winds emanating from the moving star and the ism flow local to r cas . as shown by @xcite in this volume , one can deduce the direction of the ism flow local to r cas given the direction of the proper motion by fitting the shell / bow structure in the leading , brighter eastern edge . while similar analyses would allow probing of the 3-d dynamics of the ism local to these wind - ism interacting shells",
    ", these shells do not preserve mass loss history beyond the wind crossing time of the shell . in the case of r cas",
    ", mass loss history can be probed only up to @xmath28 yr ago from the internal structure of the shell .",
