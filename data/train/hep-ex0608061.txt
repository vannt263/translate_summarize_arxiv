    "the large volume detector ( lvd ) , located in the hall a of the infn gran sasso national laboratory , italy , is a multipurpose detector consisting of a large volume of liquid scintillator interleaved with limited streamer tubes in a compact geometry .",
    "it has been in operation since 1992 , under different increasing configurations . during 2001",
    "the final upgrade took place : lvd became fully operational , with an active scintillator mass @xmath5 t.    lvd consists of an array of 840 scintillator counters , 1.5 m@xmath6 each , arranged in a compact and modular geometry ; each of them is viewed on the top by three photomultipliers .",
    "all the scintillation counters are operated at a common threshold , @xmath7 mev . to tag the delayed @xmath8 pulse due to @xmath9-capture ,",
    "all counters are equipped with an additional discrimination channel , set at a lower threshold , @xmath10 mev .",
    "+ other relevant features of the detector are : @xmath11 good event localization and muon tagging ; @xmath12 accurate absolute and relative timing : @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; @xmath15 energy resolution : @xmath16 ; @xmath17 very high duty cycle , i.e. @xmath18% in the last five years ; @xmath19 fast event recognition .",
    "the major purpose of the lvd experiment is the search for neutrinos from gravitational stellar collapses ( gsc ) in our galaxy ( aglietta et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "indeed , in spite of the lack of a `` standard '' model of the gravitational collapse of a massive star , the correlated neutrino emission appears to be well established . at the end of its burning phase a massive star ( @xmath20 )",
    "explodes into a supernova , originating a neutron star which cools emitting its binding energy mostly in neutrinos and antineutrinos , almost equipartitioned among all species : @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 denotes generically @xmath23 flavors ) .",
    "the energy spectra are approximatively a fermi - dirac distribution , with different mean temperatures , since @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath22 have different couplings with the stellar matter : @xmath26 . in the calculations presented in this work we assume a galactic supernova explosion at a typical distance of @xmath27  kpc , with a total binding energy of @xmath28 erg and perfect energy equipartition @xmath29 .",
    "we also assume that the fluxes of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are identical ; we fix @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "lvd is able to detect @xmath25 interactions with protons in the scintillator , which give the main signal of supernova neutrinos , with a very good signature .",
    "moreover , it can detect @xmath37 through the elastic scattering reactions with electrons , @xmath38 through charged current interactions with the carbon nuclei of the scintillator , and it is also sensitive to neutrinos of all flavors detectable through neutral currents reactions with the carbon nuclei .",
    "the iron support structure of the detector ( about @xmath39 t ) can also act as a target for electron neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the products of the interaction can exit iron and be detected in the liquid scintillator .",
    "the signal observable in lvd , in different reactions and due to different kinds of neutrinos , besides providing astrophysical informations on the nature of the collapse , is sensitive to intrinsic @xmath0 properties , as oscillation of massive neutrinos and can give an important contribution to define some of the neutrino oscillation properties still missing .",
    "in the study of supernova neutrinos , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are indistinguishable , both in the star and in the detector , because of the corresponding charged lepton production threshold ; consequently , in the frame of three  flavor oscillations , the relevant parameters are just @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ".    we will adopt the following numerical values : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( strumia @xmath47 vissani , 2005 ) .    in the normal mass hierarchy ( nh ) scheme ,",
    "neutrinos cross two so  called msw resonance layers in their path from the high density region where they are generated to the lower density one where they escape the star : one at higher density ( h ) , which corresponds to @xmath43 and the other at lower density ( l ) , corresponding to @xmath48 antineutrinos do not cross any msw resonance . for inverted mass hierarchy ( ih ) , transitions at the higher density layer occur in the @xmath49 sector , while at the lower density layer they occur in the @xmath0 sector .",
    "the adiabaticity condition depends both on the density variation and on the value of the oscillation parameters involved .",
    "given the energy range of supernova @xmath0 ( up to @xmath50 ) and considering a star density profile @xmath51 , the l transition is adiabatic for any lma solution values .",
    "thus the probability to jump onto an adjacent mass eigenstate ( hereafter called _ flip _ probability ) is null ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the adiabaticity at the @xmath53 resonance depends on the value of @xmath54 in the following way ( dighe @xmath47 smirnov , 2000 ) : @xmath55\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the flip probability at the h resonance .    when @xmath57 the conversion is completely adiabatic ( _ ad _ ) and the flip probability is null ( @xmath58 ) ; conversely , when @xmath59 the conversion is completely non adiabatic ( _ na _ ) and the flip probability is @xmath60 .",
    "we used in the calculation @xmath61 , which is just behind the corner of the chooz upper limit , for the adiabatic case and @xmath62 for the non adiabatic one .    for neutrinos , in the nh-_ad _",
    "case @xmath63 generated in the star arrive at earth as @xmath64 , so their probability to be detected as @xmath63 is @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the detected @xmath63 come from higher ",
    "energy @xmath66 in the star that get the earth as @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "+ if the h transition is not adiabatic or if the hierarchy is inverted the original @xmath63 get the earth as @xmath67 and their probability to be detected as @xmath63 is @xmath69 .    for antineutrinos , in the nh case or in the ih-_na",
    "_ , the @xmath70 produced in the supernova core arrive at earth as @xmath68 , and they have a high ( @xmath71 ) probability to be detected as @xmath72 .",
    "on the other hand , the original @xmath73 arrive at earth as @xmath67 and @xmath64 and are detected as @xmath70 with probability @xmath74 .",
    "+ in the ih-_ad _ case the detected @xmath70 completely come from the original , higher ",
    "energy @xmath73 flux in the star .    in figure",
    "[ fi : figibdosc ] we consider the inverse beta decay of @xmath75 ( the main interaction in lvd ) and we show the energy spectra of the detected @xmath75 in the case of no oscillation and in the case of adiabatic transition with nh and ih . in the case of oscillation ,",
    "adiabatic , normal hierarchy , there is a contribution ( @xmath76 ) of the originally higher ",
    "energy @xmath73 which gives rise to a higher average neutrino energy and to a larger number of detected events .",
    "the @xmath22 contribution is even higher ( @xmath77 ) if the transition is adiabatic and the hierarchy inverted , because the msw resonance happens in the @xmath78 sector .",
    "another important contribution to the total number of events is also given by neutrino interactions in the iron support structure of the lvd detector . given the rather high effective threshold ( about @xmath79 mev ) and the increasing detection efficiency with the neutrino energy , they are concentrated in the high energy part of the spectrum ( @xmath80 mev ) . in figure",
    "[ fi : iron ] we show the contribution of @xmath81 fe interactions on the total number of events .",
    "for the chosen supernova and oscillation parameters they are about @xmath82 of the total signal .",
    "the expected number of events in the various lvd detection channels and in the different oscillation scenarios are shown in table [ ta : central ] .    .expected results in the various lvd detection channels and in the mean energy of the detected @xmath83 events .",
    "[ ta : central ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 6.5 cm    = 6.5 cm      lvd has been continuously monitoring the galaxy since 1992 in the search for neutrino bursts from gsc .",
    "its active mass has been progressively increased from about @xmath84 t in 1992 to @xmath39 t in 2001 , always guaranteeing a sensitivity to gravitational stellar collapses up to distances @xmath85 kpc from the earth , even in the case of the lowest @xmath0-sphere temperature .",
    "[ fi : duty ] and [ fi : actmass ] we show respectively the duty cycle and the average active mass , during the last 5 years . considering just the last year ( shaded areas ) the average duty cycle was @xmath86 and the average active mass @xmath87 t.    = 5.5 cm    = 5.5 cm    all events are processed on the base of their time sequence , searching for cluster not compatible with a poissonian fluctuation of the background .",
    "a first selection consists in rejecting the crossing muon events and accepting only those with energy in the @xmath88 $ ] mev range .",
    "after this selection cut we obtain a very stable counting rate @xmath89 hz .",
    "each cluster is identified by its multiplicity @xmath90 and its duration @xmath91 ( up to @xmath92 s ) : the imitation frequency @xmath93 ( that is the frequency that a particular cluster ( @xmath90,@xmath91 ) is due to a poissonian fluctuation of the background @xmath94 ) is then calculated .",
    "the interesting candidates ( those with @xmath95 ev / year ) undergo several consistency checks : ( i ) the topological distribution of pulses inside the detector has to be uniform ; ( ii ) their energy spectrum is checked against the background spectrum and ( iii ) the time distribution of the delayed low energy pulses ( due to the @xmath96 mev gamma from the neutron capture ) must follow an exponential law .    no significant signal has been registered by lvd during 14 years of data acquisition . since the lvd sensitivity is higher than what is expected from gsc models ( even if the source is at a distance of 20 kpc and for soft neutrino energy spectra ) we can conclude that no gravitational stellar collapse has occurred in the galaxy in the whole period of observation : the resulting upper limit to the rate of gsc , updated to april , 2006 , at 90% c.l .",
    "is 0.18 events / yr .      the snews ( supernova early warning system ) ( antonioli et al . , 2004 )",
    "project is an international collaboration including several experiments sensitive to a core - collpase supernova neutrino signal in the galaxy and neighbour .",
    "the goal of snews is to provide the astronomical community with a prompt and confident alert of the occurrence of a galactic supernova event , generated by the coincidence of two or more active detectors .",
    "in addition the collaboration is engaged in cooperative work , such as the downtime coordination and inter - experiment timing verification , designed to optimize the global sensitivity to a supernova signal . +",
    "a dedicated process waits for alarm datagrams from the experiments clients , and provides an alert if there is a coincidence within a specified time window ( 10 seconds for normal running ) . in july 2005 , after a few years of tuning , the charter members of snews ( i.e. , lvd , super - k and sno ) together with the newly joined amanda / icecube , started the effective operation of the network , which means that the alert is really sent to the list subscribers , in the case of an at least two - fold coincidence ( see _ snews.bnl.gov _ to get your own sn alert ! ) .",
    "+ up to now , no inter - experiment coincidence , real or accidental , has ever occurred ( except during a special high rate test mode ) , nor any core collapse event been detected within the lifetimes of the currently active experiments .",
    "the scintillation counters are interleaved by a large acceptance tracking system made of limited streamer tubes ( @xmath97 cell cross section ) : two staggered layers cover the bottom and one lateral side of the cluster of 8 scintillation counters .",
    "they are read out by @xmath98 strips .",
    "the tracking system allows the detection and the recontruction of the cosmic muon tracks in a large fraction of the whole solid angle , in particular also horizontal tracks can be reconstructed . the total acceptance of one lvd tower is about @xmath99 .",
    "the tracking system has been operative since the beginning of the experiment ( 1992 ) until 2002 .",
    "seven million muon events have been detected and reconstructed during about @xmath100 of live time for data acquisition . in the analysis we have used muon events with all multiplicities .",
    "the acceptances for each angular bin have been calculated using the simulation of muons passing through lvd taking into account muon interaction with the detector material and the detector response . as a result of the data processing the angular distribution of the number of detected muons @xmath101 has been obtained .",
    "the angular informations allow to derive the amount of rock crossed by the muons , given the knowledge of the gran sasso mountain profile .",
    "thus , the so  called depth ",
    "intensity relation has been calculated , for a very large range of slant depths ( @xmath102 $ ] km @xmath103 ) , see figure [ fi : muons ] .",
    "two main components can be identified .",
    "the first one is dominant at slant depth up to @xmath104 km @xmath103 and is due to conventional cosmic muons , i.e. high energy downward muons produced by @xmath105 and @xmath106 mesons in the atmosphere .",
    "when fitted with the formula @xmath107 we obtain : @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "those results are in agreement with those of the other underground experiments .",
    "previous results were published in ( aglietta et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the second is due to horizontal muons produced by neutrino interaction in the rock surrounding lvd .",
    "they are independent of the slant depth and thus they become observable when the atmospheric muon flux is suppressed by the large amount of rock .",
    "their value is @xmath111 .",
    "the cngs beam will start its operation during the summer 2006 .",
    "it is a high energy @xmath112 beam mainly devoted to study neutrino oscillation through the appearance of @xmath41 at the lngs .",
    "the lvd detector will act as a useful beam monitor ( aglietta et al . ,",
    "2004 ) . two main kind of events will be detected : muons originated through charged current neutrino interaction in the rock upstream of the lngs ( about @xmath113 per days at nominal beam intensity , see a typical events in figure [ fi : cngs ] ) and the charged and neutral current interaction inside the apparatus ( about @xmath114 per day ) .",
    "the background due to cosmic muons is negligible because of the clear time structure of the cngs beam spill and the orientation of the events ( mainly vertical for cosmics , horizontal for the cngs ones ) . in one week of data",
    "acquisition a @xmath115 statistical accuracy can be obtained , useful to check for the overall beam orientation .",
    "* marco selvi : * we considered a sn core collapse at @xmath79 kpc , close to the center of the galaxy ( @xmath116 kpc ) . *",
    "jim beall s comment : * i would like to underline that the continuous and continued operation of this detector is very important ."
