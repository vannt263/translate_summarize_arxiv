    "multiple antennas can offer significant performance improvements in wireless communication systems , by providing higher data rates and more reliable links . a practical method which can achieve high data rates",
    "is to employ spatial multiplexing transmission in conjunction with low complexity linear receivers , such as the minimum - mean - squared - error ( mmse ) receiver .",
    "the mmse receiver is particularly important as it uses its receive degrees of freedom ( dof ) to optimally trade off strengthening the energy of the desired signal of interest and canceling unwanted interference , such that the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) is maximized .    in this paper , we investigate spatial multiplexing systems with mmse receivers in ad hoc networks .",
    "the transmitting nodes are spatially distributed according to a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) on a 2-d plane with density @xmath0 ( transmitting nodes per unit area ) , and send multiple data streams @xmath1 to their corresponding receiver . besides corresponding to realistic network scenarios , modeling the nodes according to a ppp has the benefit of allowing network performance measures , such as the transmission capacity , to be obtained .",
    "the transmission capacity measures the maximum number of successful transmissions per unit area , assuming transmission at a fixed data rate , such that a target outage probability @xmath2 is attained .    to maintain a desired performance level for a fixed number of data streams per unit area @xmath3",
    ", a natural question arises whether it is preferable to have a high density of single - stream transmissions , or a low density of multi - stream transmissions .",
    "the main finding of this paper is that single - stream transmission is preferable when the optimal linear processing strategy , i.e.  the mmse receiver , is employed .",
    "this is due to the weaker interference powers from the strongest interferers remaining after interference - cancelation in single - stream transmission networks , compared to multi - stream transmission networks .",
    "this key result is facilitated by new exact closed - form expressions we derive for the outage probability and transmission capacity for arbitrary numbers of receive and transmit antennas .",
    "prior work on single - stream transmission with multiple receive antennas in ad hoc networks and poisson distributed transmitting nodes include @xcite , where spectral efficiency and transmission capacity scaling laws were presented for different receiver structures . in @xcite , receive antennas are used for spatial diversity to increase the desired signal power , while in @xcite , receive antennas are used to cancel interference from the strongest interferer nodes . in @xcite ,",
    "mmse receivers are used and the average spectral efficiency , a per - link performance measure , was obtained in the large antenna regime . in @xcite , by using sub - optimal and mmse linear receivers , the transmission capacity was shown to scale linearly with the number of receive antennas . in this paper , we extend these prior works to derive new outage probability and transmission capacity scaling laws for arbitrary number of data streams using mmse receivers .    multi - stream transmission with multiple receive antennas have been considered in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "spatial multiplexing systems were considered where receive antennas are used to cancel interference from the corresponding transmitter , but not the interferers . for these papers ,",
    "the transmission capacity was shown to scale as means @xmath4 . ]",
    "a better scaling of @xmath6 was obtained in @xcite by using sub - optimal receivers to cancel interference from the strongest @xmath7 interferers .",
    "this scaling result was used to show that single - stream transmission was preferable over multi - stream transmission when sub - optimal receivers are used @xcite ; in this paper we use a similar scaling result to show this is also true using optimal mmse receivers .",
    "we consider an ad hoc network comprising of transmitter - receiver pairs , where each transmitter communicates to its corresponding receiver in a point - to - point manner , treating all other transmissions as interference .",
    "the transmitting nodes are distributed spatially according to a homogeneous ppp of intensity @xmath0 in @xmath8 , and each receiving node is randomly placed at a distance @xmath9 away from its corresponding transmitter .    in this paper , we investigate network - wide performance . to characterize this performance ,",
    "it is sufficient to focus on a typical transmitter - receiver pair , denoted by index 0 , with the typical receiver located at the origin .",
    "the transmitting nodes , with the exception of the typical transmitter , constitute a marked ppp , which by slivnyak s theorem , has the same distribution as the original ppp @xcite ( i.e. , removing the typical transmitter from the transmit process has no effect ) .",
    "this is denoted by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 model the location and channel matrix respectively of the @xmath13th transmitting node with respect to ( w.r.t . )",

    "the transmitted signals are attenuated by a factor @xmath14 with distance @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the path loss exponent .",
    "we consider a spatial multiplexing system where each transmitting node sends @xmath1 independent data streams through @xmath1 different antennas to its corresponding receiver , which is equipped with @xmath17 antennas .",
    "focusing on the @xmath18th stream , the received @xmath19 signal vector at the typical receiver can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the symbol sent from the @xmath22th transmit antenna of the @xmath13th transmitting node satisfying @xmath23=p$ ] , @xmath24 is the @xmath22th column of means that @xmath25 _ is distributed as _ @xmath26 . ]",

    "we see in ( [ eq : y ] ) that the received vector includes : ( a ) the desired data to be decoded , ( b ) the self interference from the typical transmitter and ( c ) the interference from the other transmitting nodes .",
    "to obtain an estimate for @xmath29 , we consider the use of mmse linear receivers . the data estimate is thus given by @xmath30 ,",
    "from which the sinr can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the transmit signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we assume that each receiving node has knowledge of the corresponding transmitter channel @xmath34 and the interference ( plus noise ) covariance matrix @xmath35 .",
    "the practicalities of this assumption are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we consider the per - stream outage probability , defined for the @xmath18th stream as the probability that the mutual information for the @xmath18th stream lies below the data rate threshold @xmath36 . at the receiver",
    ", the mmse filter outputs are decoded independently .",
    "we assume the data rate thresholds for all streams are the same and equal to @xmath37 .",
    "the outage probability for each stream can thus be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the sinr threshold .",
    "note that we have dropped the subscript @xmath18 and 0 from the @xmath40 term as the per - stream outage probability is the same for each stream at each receiving node .    before presenting the outage probability ,",
    "we first introduce some notation and concepts from number theory .",
    "the integer partitions of positive integer @xmath18 is defined as the different ways of writing @xmath18 as a sum of positive integers @xcite .",

    "for example , when @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "the transmission capacity is given in the following lemma .",

    "the result is proven by taking a first order expansion of the outage probability in ( [ eq : outage_main ] ) at high snr around @xmath73 , followed by substituting the resultant expression into ( [ eq : tc_def ] ) .",
    "the full proof is omitted due to space limitations .    by observing that the exponent of @xmath2 in ( [ eq : transmission_cap_main ] ) is a decreasing function of the number of data streams",
    ", we see that for low outage probability operating values , the transmission capacity is maximized when only one data stream is used for transmission .",
    "this can be explained by considering the interference - cancelation properties of the mmse receiver . as the mmse receiver is the optimal linear processing strategy ,",
    "the receive dof is used to optimally trade off canceling the interference from the strongest interferers and strengthening the desired signals from the corresponding transmitter , such that the received sinr is maximized .",
    "the mmse receiver is capable of completely canceling interference from both the corresponding transmitter and the strongest @xmath18 interferers if and only if @xmath74 @xcite , or equivalently @xmath75 .",
    "the receiver can thus cancel interference from the @xmath76 strongest interferers if @xmath77 it can be shown that the value of @xmath18 satisfying the condition in ( [ eq : condition_nearest ] ) corresponds to @xmath78 .",
    "the mmse receiver is thus capable of canceling interference from the @xmath79 strongest interferers .",
    "as the transmission capacity increases with the number of strongest interferers whose interference is canceled , this implies the mmse receiver will utilize the maximum possible dof to cancel interference from the strongest interferers . by noting that the receiver will require a minimum @xmath1 dof to ensure the desired signals",

    "thus single - stream transmission is preferable over multi - stream transmission as there are more strongest interferers whose interference are canceled .",
