    "quantum impurity problems in 1 + 1 dimensions have long been the subject of intense study due to numerous applications in fields such as quantum wires , the quantum hall effect and the kondo problem . in particular ,",
    "much research has been invested into understanding the behavior of particle transfer through an impurity and of growing interest experimentally and theoretically are the statistics of the fluctuations in the transferred charge .",
    "most efforts have been concentrated on the shot noise which is sensitive to the quantization of charge and can give useful information about the system.@xcite in recent years , it was realized that the full counting statistics , probability distribution @xmath2 of the transmitted charge @xmath3 in a given time window @xmath4 , contains more information.@xcite along with the shot noise , the full counting statistics also contains information about the higher order correlations which are of interest experimentally .",
    "it has been suggested that the third moment may give a more reliable measure of the charge than the shot noise.@xcite recent experimental efforts suggest that the higher moments of the full counting statistics may be accessible.@xcite    in cases where fermi liquid theory applies , the full counting statistics has been studied extensively ( see ref . [ ] for a review ) .",
    "systems of strongly interacting electrons , though of importance in 1 + 1 dimensional quantum wires , the quantum hall effect and kondo problem have been less well studied .",
    "using advanced methods such as the thermodynamic bethe ansatz , for the laughlin states exact results for the charge current through an impurity,@xcite as well as the noise,@xcite the heat current , @xcite and even attempts at the full counting statistics were reported.@xcite exploiting the power of boundary conformal field theory , the full counting statistics in double quantum dots was studied.@xcite    a subject of recent interest is the behavior of quantum entanglement , and in particular of the entanglement entropy , in condensed matter systems ( for a recent review see ref . [ ] . ) the entanglement entropy has been shown to exhibit universal scaling behavior near quantum critical points.@xcite universal scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy is also present in topological phases of matter , such as fractional quantum hall fluids and their generalizations , as well as in the related topological quantum field theories.@xcite however , the entanglement entropy of a macroscopic quantum system is a highly non - local quantity which is difficult to measure .",
    "it has remained a challenge to find an experimentally viable protocol to measure the entanglement entropy .",
    "several recent results have suggested that the behavior of point contacts in quantum critical systems , and topological phases , may offer a way to measure the entanglement entropy .",
    "fendley et al have shown@xcite that the change in the entanglement entropy of topological fqh fluids at a point of constriction is related ( in fact the same ) to the change of the affleck - ludwig entropy@xcite of the coupled edge states of the fqh fluid at the point contact .",
    "however , the affleck - ludwig entropy itself is difficult to measure .",
    "more recently , klich and levitov@xcite have shown that , at least for a system of free fermions , it may be possible to measure the growth ( in time ) of the entanglement entropy upon a quantum quench by monitoring the noise in the charge current through the contact .",
    "specifically , they proposed that the second cumulant of the full counting statistics is related to the entanglement entropy .",
    "they considered the following protocol : first the two subsystems described by non - interacting fermions lying on either side of an infinite strength impurity are completely decoupled . at time @xmath1 , the impurity is removed and the subsystems are allowed to exchange particles . finally at time @xmath5 , the impurity is reinstated and blocks the flow of particles .",
    "they find that the shot noise generated is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is some short time cutoff .",
    "such a protocol is a suggestive procedure for measuring the quantum entanglement between two halves of a system . in the initial state",
    "the two subsystems lying on either side of the impurity are completely independent , but following the quench , quantum entanglement is dynamically built up by the exchange of particles with vanishing net flow . a measure of the entanglement between the two subsystems is provided by the entanglement entropy .",
    "the entanglement entropy for such a scenario was recently calculated using conformal field theory ( cft ) and shown to increase logarithmically with time , with a universal coefficient proportional to the central charge @xmath8 characterizing the cft , @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a short distance cutoff . by comparing eqns .",
    "[ eqn : levitov]-[eqn : cardy ] and noting that for non - interacting fermions , the central charge is @xmath11 , it is quite suggestive that the noise is a measurement of the entanglement .",
    "however , it should be noted that while the methods of calabrese and cardy are general , the results of klich and levitov are specific to non - interacting electrons .",
    "the degree of general validity ( _ e.g. _ for interacting systems ) of the klich - levitov protocol is presently an open question .",
    "recently there has also been a surge of interest in quantum quenching , _",
    "i.e. _ where the parameters that describe the dynamics of the system are changed over a short period of time either locally or globally . in cold atoms ,",
    "it has been seen experimentally that quantum quenches may show interesting features.@xcite theoretically , quantum quenching has also attracted a good deal of attention in recent years.@xcite it was found recently that in a global quench , where the eigenstate state @xmath12 of a hamiltonian @xmath13 is evolved by a different hamiltonian @xmath14 , the correlation functions were found to display universal behavior characteristic of the hamiltonian @xmath14 if it was tuned near criticality.@xcite    in this work , we study a _",
    "local _ quantum quench where the point contact between two @xmath0 fractional quantum hall states is instantaneously opened ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : quench ] ) .",
    "we examine the noise and the full counting statistics and extend the results of klich and levitov [ ] to a system of interacting electrons with a dynamic impurity .",
    "no external bias is applied . here",
    "the bare strength of the impurity coupling undergoes a sudden change between two values , the first corresponding to fully reflecting boundary conditions and the second to fully transmitting boundary conditions .",
    "the quantum point contact ( qpc ) generates an effective impurity in the luttinger liquid description of the edge , thus allowing complete control over the impurity strength by tuning the voltage applied to a side gate .",
    "such a system is therefore a promising candidate for an experimental exploration of quantum quenches .",
    "our main result is that the second moment of the full counting statistics , and therefore the noise , has a similar form to the entanglement entropy .",
    "this result holds even for interacting ( luttinger ) systems .",
    "however , we also find that this correspondence appears to be coincidental since , in general , in addition to the noted dependence of the central charge , the noise depends also on other universal quantities of the underlying conformal field theory of the system .",
    "there is however a conceptual difference between static and dynamic entanglement .",
    "static entanglement refers to the measure of the non - local correlations associated with the _ observation _ of a part of the system without disturbing it and is encoded in the von neumann entanglement entropy . on the other hand , when a physical system is changed , as in a quantum quench , the ensuing _ dynamical _ entanglement measures the non - local correlations that develop upon its time evolution in the quenched system .",
    "( see , _ e.g. _ ref . [ ] ) . at the computational level ,",
    "the main method underlying our results is the use of a boundary condition changing operator to generate the transition between the fully closed qpc and the fully open one .",
    "this transition is related to a change in the sign of the odd - boson density operator going through the qpc , thus is marked by the appearance of an orbifold theory .",
    "the method in its most general form will be described in section [ section : orbifolds ] . in sections [ section :",
    "majorana ] and [ section : orbifolds ] we describe the method for @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for the particular case of @xmath15 , the result can be derived explicitly using a majorana fermion representation for the re - fermionized hamiltonian .",
    "finally , in section [ section : noise ] we calculate the noise , and in [ section : fcs ] the full counting statistics . in section [ section : thermal ]",
    "we sketch the calculation of the noise of the energy - momentum in the quantum ising chain , showing that in contrast to the entanglement entropy in a 1 + 1 dimensional critical system , the noise does not always grow logarithmically .",
    "the details of the calculations for the laughlin @xmath15 ( bosonic ) state are presented in appendix [ appendix : nu - half ] .",
    "the modular @xmath17-matrix and fusion rules for the orbifold cft ( used in section [ section : orbifolds ] ) are given in appendix [ appendix : orbifoldalgebra ] .",

    "the physical hilbert space of each chiral boson is generated by @xmath26 , the @xmath27 current and the vertex operator @xmath28 ( see ref . [ ] ) .",
    "this vertex operator generates the charged excited states of the theory which are fundamentally generated by adding or subtracting an electron from either the left or right edge.@xcite requiring that the charged excitations generated by @xmath29 are bosons ( electrons ) implies that they satisfy the ( anti- ) commutation relation sets @xmath30 an even ( odd ) integer .",
    "the requirement that the charge of the operator is precisely @xmath31 forces the relation @xmath32 .",
    "representations of the theory are local with respect to the @xmath27 current and charged excitation @xmath33 which is identified with the electron ( @xmath30 odd ) or boson ( @xmath30 even ) .",

    "the charge densities at the left and right edges are respectively @xmath37 note that @xmath38 , so in particular the electron operator is well defined provided @xmath39 is an integer ; hence @xmath40 carries the meaning of the number of quasi - particles on the edge . in units of the electron charge @xmath31 , the charge carried by the edge is @xmath41 .",
    "we now perform the following transformation into the odd and even basis @xmath42 the even boson @xmath43 decouples from the impurity , and we ignore it in the rest of the paper .",
    "note that @xmath44 are both left - moving .",
    "the odd and even charges are related to the original @xmath45-charges through @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",

    "no bias is applied and the temperature is taken to be zero . at some time , the two halves of the system are ( suddenly ) connected and we wish to consider the statistics of the charge transferred from one side to the other upon this change , _",
    "i.e. _ a quantum quench . the system is then evolved with the hamiltonian with a hilbert space described by states with transmitting boundary conditions at the quantum point contact .",
    "let @xmath2 be the probability that charge @xmath3 is transmitted through the point contact in time @xmath4 .",
    "then one defines the generating function @xmath48 which encodes all moments ( or cumulants ) @xmath49 of the probability distribution @xmath2 , @xmath50 in particular , the second moment @xmath51 is related to the current fluctuations .",
    "the generating function can be written as @xmath52 where the operators are ordered on the schwinger - keldysh contour.@xcite this can also be written as a trace over a complete set of states .",
    "@xmath53 where @xmath54 is the _ initial _ density matrix , and @xmath55 is the time evolution operator for time @xmath4 after the point contact is opened . in eq .",
    "it should be understood that the trace is taken over the initial states .",
    "if the scattering time at the quantum point contact is short compared with the entire time evolution , then it was shown that @xmath56 can be written as@xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the initial distribution of states and @xmath17 is the reflection - transmission matrix at the quantum point contact . in ref .",
    "[ ] , it was found that for _ non - interacting electrons _ , the generating function is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "in this work , we generalize this protocol to the @xmath0 laughlin states .",
    "we note that while the full counting statistics has been found in many other strongly correlated systems with a static impurity via the thermodynamic bethe ansatz,@xcite the application of this method to finding time and space dependent correlation functions is in general difficult and remains largely not understood .",
    "we take a different approach in tackling this problem .",
    "this relies on the realization that one should consider an extended hilbert space by introducing a boundary changing operator to the edge theory and that physical charged excitations in the initial hilbert space are those conserving total charge . in the next section ,",
    "we examine the noise in @xmath15 which can be refermionized and solved explicitly .",
    "we note an interesting structure which we then extend to the other laughlin states at @xmath0 .",
    "in doing so , we calculate the noise and full counting statistics for the laughlin states .",
    "we start our discussion with an exactly solvable case , the bosonic quantum hall effect at filling factor @xmath15 .",
    "our strategy is as follows : re - fermionizing , we first recast the problem in terms of a quadratic fermionic action .",
    "then , by writing the fermionic field in terms of two real majorana fermion fields , we find that only one of the majorana fermions interacts with the impurity .",
    "the two fixed points associated with the fully transmitting and the fully reflecting impurity , translate into anti - periodic and periodic boundary conditions imposed on this majorana fermion .",
    "this leads us to identify the operator that takes the system between the two fixed points as the @xmath61 operator of the chiral ising model .",
    "armed with this knowledge , we then proceed to use this formalism to calculate the noise for the case of a quantum point contact which is suddenly opened at time @xmath62 .      the odd boson theory can be re - fermionized in terms of a fermion field @xmath63 ( see appendix [ appendix : nu - half ] ) leading to the hamiltonian @xmath64\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the crucial step is that the hamiltonian can be written in a majorana representation , @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 satisfy @xmath68 . in this representation ,",
    "only @xmath67 interacts with the impurity , as is clear by inspecting the equations of motion , @xmath69 integrating the equations leads to the following boundary condition across the impurity , @xmath70 , @xmath71 this boundary condition is continuously interpolating between the fully reflecting and fully transmitting boundary conditions for the odd boson @xmath72 similarly , at @xmath73 , we have the boundary condition , @xmath74 the problem is thus mapped to a single chiral majorana fermion on a circle of circumference @xmath75 . for the reflecting case we have anti - periodic ( ap ) boundary conditions , while for the transmitting case , we have periodic ( p ) boundary conditions .",
    "the free majorana field theory contains altogether three primary fields : the identity field * 1 * , the majorana fermion field @xmath76 , and a @xmath61 operator ( known as the ising twist field ) creating a branch cut on the majorana fermion @xmath76 . as before , we shall label the two copies of fields present here by an index @xmath77 : * 1*@xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . to go from periodic to anti - periodic boundary conditions on @xmath67",

    "we thus identify the operator taking the system between the two fixed points associated with the qpc as the @xmath81 operator in the @xmath67 majorana fermion field theory .    in particular , to go from anti - periodic to periodic boundary condition , introduce two @xmath81 operators in the  bulk \" surrounded by the @xmath67 edge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary - changing ] ) .",
    "one of them then approaches the edge at @xmath34 and a bulk - edge coupling is introduced .",
    "this coupling is mediated by virtual processes involving the tunneling of topologically trivial modes between the bulk and the edge @xcite . finally , when @xmath19 , the edge circumvents the operator completely , and switches to ap boundary conditions . in the sudden approximation",

    "however , these boundary conditions ( _ i.e. _ the effects of the operator @xmath81 ) will affect @xmath67 only after a long time - scale set by @xmath93 . in the limit @xmath94 we can safely neglect the effects of these boundary condition changing operators . upon the introduction of a uv cutoff @xmath95 , the short - time switching scale needed to regulate the integral , the second cumulant @xmath51 can be obtained . @xmath96",
    "the expression can be easily integrated to get @xmath97 in the limit of large @xmath4 this reduces to @xmath98",
    "the essential point is that the theory of the two edge states coupled by the local qpc must have a local boundary changing operator @xmath81 that takes the system from one fixed point to the other . in particular",
    ", the operator @xmath81 maps the ground state of the system with a closed qpc to an energy eigenstate of the same system but with the new boundary conditions , an open qpc .",
    "the ensuing growth of the entanglement entropy is due to the evolution of correlations of the excitations in this state.@xcite      the previous discussion can also be understood in terms of the boson .",
    "this picture lends itself to generalization to the other laughlin states which are also described by free chiral bosonic theories . here",
    ", we show that from the bosonic picture , one can deduce that @xmath61 operator must be introduced for one of the majorana fermions to change the boundary condition from anti - periodic to periodic .",
    "we then argue that a similar boundary condition changing operator can be included in the bosonic theory .",
    "one can understand the relationship between boson and fermion boundary conditions and the nature of the twist operator by examining the partition functions .",
    "specializing to @xmath15 , the lagrangian becomes @xmath99 the boundary condition at the impurity site changes from @xmath100 perfectly reflecting ( neumann boundary conditions ) to @xmath101 perfectly transmitting ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) .",
    "the neumann boundary condition simply fixes the field @xmath102 to be continuous across the boundary while the dirichlet boundary condition allows the field to be discontinuous .",
    "imposing neumann boundary conditions at the ends of the system for all times , the mode expansion for the odd boson can be found . for neumann ( n ) and dirichlet ( d ) boundary conditions at the origin respectively , @xmath103 the partition function in each sector can then be computed for each set of boundary conditions and one finds @xmath104 where @xmath105 are partition functions for a single @xmath106 holomorphic fermion with boundary conditions @xmath107 in time and @xmath26 in space , a anti - periodic and p periodic . to go from @xmath100 to @xmath101",
    ", we see that exactly one majorana fermion changes anti - periodic to periodic boundary conditions in time .",
    "now , the partition function @xmath108 is also related to the partition function @xmath109 by an insertion of the fermion counting operator @xmath110 in the time direction . by a conformal transformation",
    ", this operator is related to the spin operator of the ising model inserted in the space direction for one of the majorana fermions that compose the theory.@xcite this confirms the results of the previous section .",
    "while this identifies the boundary changing operator as the spin operator in the ising model , this is a special feature of @xmath15 state . at other filling fractions",
    "the boson can no longer be fermionized , but what is independent of the filling is the boson mode expansion and the partition functions @xmath111 . to generalize the calculation of the noise beyond @xmath15 , one should identify the boundary condition changing operator in the bosonic theory that takes neumann boundary conditions to dirichlet boundary conditions .    a priori , it may seem strange that a @xmath11 free bosonic theory must include a boundary changing operator , but the necessity of this operator can be seen at the level of the path integral . the path integral should be time ordered on the schwinger - keldysh contour , but by an analytic continuation , one can regard the schwinger - keldysh contour as the time surface for a conformal field theory@xcite ( see fig.[fig : keldysh ] ) . in going from the density matrix to the path integral formulation",
    ", one must consider an _ extended _ hilbert space of the hamiltonian @xmath112 which is spanned by states with all possible boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary changing operators appear as unitary operators that map whole sectors of the extended hilbert space with particular boundary conditions to sectors with different boundary conditions.@xcite details of this analytic continuation can also be found in appendix [ appendix : keldyshentangle ] and in refs .",

    "such a boundary conformal field theory was studied in the context of the x - ray edge singularity and quantum wires.@xcite the neumann boundary condition implies that the odd boson is continuous at @xmath34 while the dirichlet boundary condition implies that the odd boson is discontinuous at @xmath34 . as discussed by affleck and ludwig,@xcite this",
    "can be written as : @xmath116 this has an interpretation of a branch cut running on the @xmath115-world sheet across which the odd boson is discontinuous . in ref .",

    "the reflecting and transmitting boundary condition were given by @xmath210 and @xmath211 respectively.@xcite imposing either of these boundary conditions , one sees that the left - left and right - right correlation functions are unaffected but the left - right correlation function changes by a minus sign .",

    "while the second cumulant can easily be shown to grow logarithmically in time , our result shows that the coefficient of this logarithm _ depends on the modular @xmath17-matrix elements of the theory and not just to its central charge _ , so that even for @xmath11 the second cumulant does _ not _ fully give the entanglement entropy .",
    "the full counting statistics ( fcs ) is the generating function for the moments of the charge transfered between two reservoirs through a constriction . in ref .",
    "[ ] , the fcs was calculated for the process of opening and closing the qpc , with the result that the distribution function for the transmitted charge is purely gaussian .",
    "here we shall extend our methods developed in the previous sections to find the fcs in the interacting case , and conclude that the non - interacting result is in fact robust to the presence of interactions .",
    "it is plausible that even in the interacting case , there exists a simple relation between the fcs and the entanglement entropy .    to avoid boundary effects ,",
    "it is convenient for our purposes to consider a corbino ( annular ) geometry , with a single qpc inducing backscattering between the edges . in this new geometry",
    ", we should actually reverse the protocol appearing in previous sections : first the qpc is open , then is quickly closed , and remains in this state during a time period @xmath4 , at the end of which it is opened again .",
    "going to the odd / even basis for the two edge bosons , the charge carried by the odd boson , @xmath215 , is controlled by the singularity induced by the branch cut for the closed qpc ( assumed to be located at @xmath34 ) .",
    "the full counting statistics is then given by the following correlation function , @xmath216 which , using the observation above , can be reduced to the calculation of vertex operators at the vicinity of the qpc .",

    "consequently , only the second cumulant ( _ i.e. _ the noise ) is non - zero .",
    "interestingly , except for the explicit dependence on the filling factor @xmath207 , the full counting statistics has the same form as the non - interacting electron case .",
    "writing the boson in the even and odd basis and folding the system , this problem can be mapped onto the boundary sine - gordon model . in the basis of kink and anti - kink solitons of charge @xmath3 and @xmath218 respectively , distribution functions can be found via the thermodynamic bethe ansatz for the entire range of @xmath36.@xcite the problem is then similar to the non - interacting electron problem only the particles are collective modes rather than the original electrons .",
    "however , in this picture , the full counting statistics is difficult to compute .",
    "the reflection and transmission coefficients of the time dependent scattering matrix@xcite are difficult to write in the kink and anti - kink basis .",
    "although in previous sections we showed that the noise generated by a quench can also evolve logarithmically with time , we will show now that this is not always true .",
    "this is in contrast to the static entanglement entropy which depends logarithmically on the size of the observed region@xcite and the dynamic entanglement entropy which evolves logarithmically with time.@xcite    consider a one - dimensional quantum ising model that can be split in two by changing with time the strength of just one link .",
    "this effectively implies a change in boundary conditions at that link .",
    "we use the majorana fermion description of the critical quantum ising model , @xmath219 where @xmath220 ( @xmath221 ) is a left - going ( right - going ) majorana fermion , and @xmath222 was flipped . at the center of the ising chain ( @xmath34 )",
    "we modify the link strength , which translates in the effective fermion description to a coupling to the local energy density operator @xmath223 at the same point @xmath224 this marginal perturbation leads to the following relation between the fields on the two sides of the impurity @xmath225 with @xmath226 when @xmath36 is fine tuned to the point @xmath227 , @xmath228 becomes completely off - diagonal @xmath229 .",
    "when @xmath21 , @xmath228 approaches the identity matrix , @xmath230 .    the quantum ising model and its effective field theory , the free majorana fermion , has a ( discrete ) global @xmath163 symmetry .",
    "contrary to the luttinger - type models which have a globally conserved @xmath27 charge and a locally conserved ( dimension one ) charge current , in the case of the quantum ising model the only global conservation law is the energy - momentum and its locally conserved ( dimension two ) energy - momentum current .",
    "in contrast with the luttinger model where the quantum quench does not change the total charge , in the ising model the quantum quench changes the hamiltonian and hence the total energy .",
    "although the energy - momentum tensor of the majorana fermion field theory ( and of the ising model ) remains locally conserved everywhere _ except _ at the location of the quantum impurity , these physical differences lead to a distinct asymptotic time dependence of the noise in the energy - momentum current shown below .",
    "the energy density along the edge is defined by @xmath231 the rate of back - scattering of energy by the modified link is @xmath232 using the relations above , for the case that the link is fully transmitting ( @xmath233 ) , the heat current is zero as the contributions on the two sides of the link cancel . in the limit of a fully reflecting link",
    ", we get @xmath234 , and the two contributions add up .",
    "since the scaling dimension of the energy current is @xmath235 we get the following expression for the thermal noise @xmath236 : @xmath237 for large @xmath4 , the thermal noise approaches a non - universal , cutoff dependent , value @xmath238",
    "in the previous sections we identified an extended theory of the bosonic luttinger description of the quantum hall edge states in the presence of an impurity . the extended theory , being an @xmath239 orbifold theory ( for @xmath0 ) , explicitly contains an operator inducing the transition between the zero - backscattering and fully - backscattering fixed points of the impurity .",
    "in particular , for @xmath15 the extended theory decouples into two copies of @xmath163 parafermions , whereas for @xmath167 it coincides with @xmath169 parafermions instead .",
    "the presence of the primary field in the algebra which induces the transition between the two fixed points at the impurity demonstrates that in the sudden approximation equilibrium is maintained through each process of opening or closing of the qpc , and that no transient effects are expected .    using these methods we calculated the fcs for the interacting luttinger liquid for the process of a sudden opening ( at @xmath240 ) then closing ( at @xmath5 ) of the qpc .",
    "only the second cumulant of the transferred charge is nonzero , and its logarithmic dependence on @xmath241 suggests that a relation between the entanglement entropy and the fcs should exist even in the interacting case . in that sense , the noise `` measures '' the entanglement entropy .",
    "the only difference from the non - interacting case is the explicit appearance of the filling factor in the noise .    in a more general",
    "setting , however , the relation between the fcs and the entanglement entropy does not seems to be structural .",
    "first , it requires the presence of a conserved current with dimension 1 ( essential for a logarithmic behavior of the correlation function ) , and of an associated and strictly conserved global charge .",
    "in contrast , the energy - momentum noise through a weak link in the one - dimensional ising model does not reproduce , or even has the same form , as the entanglement entropy .",
    "we discuss this case briefly in section [ section : thermal ] .",
    "also , for any quantum hall state which contains neutral edge modes , the generated entanglement entropy is proportional to the total central charge , @xmath8 , but in the absence of an impurity the noise involves only the pure current present in the charge carrying @xmath11 theory alone .",
    "this can be amended by adding the central charge explicitly into the relation between the noise and the entanglement entropy , but this argument seems to be ignoring the mechanisms that create entanglement in the neutral theory .",
    "moreover , even for the simple luttinger case the central charge does not appear in the noise ( which depends only on the fusion rules and the conformal dimensions of the cft ) while it certainly appears explicitly in the entanglement entropy . indeed ,",
    "our results show that the noise generated is a measurement of _ dynamical _ entanglement and not of the _ static _ entanglement that is associated with the observation of a subsystem in an eigenstate of the full system .",
    "@xcite    interestingly , we also find that the time dependent correlation functions have a universal scaling behavior as in the case of the global quench.@xcite however , the universal behavior is characteristic of an orbifold theory of the original system .",
    "it may be of interest to study this experimentally where corrections to scaling are sure to occur .",
    "the flow away from criticality would presumably involve the more exotic fusion rules .    in summary , in this paper",
    "we have computed the noise of the tunneling current generated by a quantum quench of a point contact in a fractional quantum hall fluid .",
    "this was done by explicit solution for the bosonic laughlin state at @xmath15 and by conformal field theory methods for a general laughlin state .",
    "we have also computed the growth of the entanglement entropy due to the quantum quench .",
    "we found that even though the time dependence of the noise has the _ same form _ as the entanglement entropy the latter has a more intricate dependence on the properties of the conformal field theory and the hilbert space of the edge state .",
