    "light interactions with dielectric or metallic surfaces displaying well  defined subwavelength  sized structures ( natural or lithographically designed ) give rise to unusual optical effects@xcite .",
    "the recently observed `` light confinement state '' in which the light field is trapped by individual surface defects , belongs to this class of phenomena@xcite .",
    "although , with usual dielectric materials ( silica for example ) , the local near  field intensity variations observed around the particles ( or structures ) remains moderate over the optical spectrum ( between 10 to 40 per cent of the incident light intensity ) , these variations can nevertheless be easily mapped with the tip of a photon scanning tunneling microscope ( pstm)@xcite .",
    "the images recorded with this technique reveal dramatic changes when passing from the tm ( transverse magnetic ) to the te ( transverse electric ) polarized modes .",
    "in general , tm  polarized light tends to display larger contrast than te  polarized light .",
    "> from the experimental point of view , the definition of the polarization direction of the incident and detected intensity must be defined with respect to a unique incident plane .",
    "about six years ago van hulst and collaborators proposed a clever probe configuration devoted to polarization mapping @xcite .",
    "these authors performed these measurements by using a combined pstm / afm microscope in which detection is implemented by a microfabricated silicon  nitride probe .",
    "> from this technique , polarization contrast is extracted by changing the polarization directions of both the incident and the detected light .",
    "the main findings gathered in this work@xcite , concern the relative efficiency of the four excitation  detection possibilities ( te / te , te / tm , tm / te , and tm / tm ) to record a highly resolved pstm image . in particular , the efficiency of the tm / tm acquisition mode is well reproduced . although a complete interpretation of this work requires a realistic numerical implementation of the combined afm / pstm probe tip , we can obtain useful information by analyzing the near  field polarization state versus the polarization state of the illumination mode .",
    "in addition , in closely related contexts , the control of the near  field polarization state provides an interesting and versatile tool for generating powerful applications ( tunneling time measurements @xcite , highly  resolved microscopy and spectroscopy @xcite , surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy of molecular adlayers @xcite , atom optics @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in the field of atom optics and interferometry , one is interested in building diffraction gratings that can play the role of beam splitters .",
    "several devices have been successfully realised , ranging from mechanical transmission gratings to light standing waves in free space or evanescent for a prism . for a general review",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite . to circumvent some theoritical limitations @xcite",
    "it has been recently proposed @xcite to use micrometer sized metallic stripes to shape the evanescent field . a full near - field , metallic / dielectric approach open obviously new perspectives .",
    "in particular the spacing period is no longer linked to the atomic optical transition and a reflection stucture can not clug .",
    "more , higher harmonics in the optical evanescent field can be tuned to produce for example a blazed atomic grating .",
    "nevertheless , the optical potential is strongly related to the light field polarisation , which is a farther motivation for the present study .",
    "we will begin our theoretical analysis with a simple dipolar scheme in which the main experimental parameters ( incident angle , optical index , polarization of the incident light , ... ) appear explicitly@xcite . in a second stage",
    ", these results will be completed with an _ ab ",
    "initio _ approach allowing objects of arbitrary shape to be treated exactly .",
    "to illustrate the coupling between a polarized incident wave and a small spherical object lying on the sample , we consider the simple dipolar model depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "the substrate modifies the polarizability @xmath0 of the particle .",
    "we have then @xmath1 with @xmath2^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the nonretarded propagator associated with the bare surface , and @xmath4 labels the particle location . within this description , the optical properties of the spherical particle ",
    "surface supersystem is described in terms of a `` dressed '' polarizability@xcite .",
    "the analytical form of @xmath5 can be derived from eq .",
    "( 10 ) of reference 5 .",
    "this dyadic tensor remains diagonal with two independent components @xmath6 ( perpendicular to the interface ) and @xmath7 ( parallel to the interface ) : @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the optical index of refraction of the substrate .      at an observation point @xmath11 located above the sample ( @xmath12 @xmath13 0 ) and in the immediate proximity of the particle , the incident light field",
    "is locally distorted . as illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , these distortions generate not only a profound modification of the intensity level ( both electric and magnetic ) , but also a complete change of the polarization state . at subwavelength distances from the scatterers ,",
    "we expect therefore to observe the occurrence of new components that were absent in the incident field @xmath14 .",
    "the physical origin of this polarization transfer can be easily understood if we introduce the two relevant field propagators @xmath15 and @xmath16 that establish the physical link between the oscillating dipole @xmath17 = @xmath18 and the new near  field state @xmath19 generated above the particle @xmath20 and @xmath21 where in the near  field zone , i.e. when @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 the discussion of the two equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) can be made easier when considering specific examples .      in this incident polarization mode ,",
    "the electric field is directed along the ( oy ) axis .",
    "we have then @xmath27 = @xmath28 .",
    "let us see what happens when the observation point moves along the diagonal straigth line ( a  b ) schematized in figure 2 .    for a given @xmath29 angle",
    ", the introduction of the position vector @xmath30 = @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 varies between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) along the line ( a  b ) , allows the electric field polarization evolution to be observed when passing over the particle .",
    "each cartesian component can be simply extracted from eq .",
    "this leads to three analytical relations : @xmath35 @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 some interesting features can be deduced from these equations .",
    "( i ) first , we observe that the polarisation is not modified when the observation point is perpendicular the particle center ( i.e. when r = 0 ) .",
    "the set of equations reduces then to @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 clearly the effective polarizability reduces the electric field magnitude compared to its initial value .",
    "this fact explains the observation of contrasted dark zones above small particles lighted with the te polarization ( c.f .",
    "( ii ) around the particle ( when r/2 @xmath23 r",
    "@xmath23 2r ) two new components , namely @xmath42 and @xmath43 , define a new local polarization state .",

    "similar relations can be derived for the tm  polarized mode from eq .",

    "let us examine what happens with the magnetic field part ( cf .",

    ", the polarization change corresponds to a different balance in the initial components .",
    "it is important to recall that we have used the dipole approximation to describe the particle - field interaction , i.e. the size of the particle is assumed to be small compared to the wavelength of light . in a more realistic calculation , with nanostructures of characteristic dimension @xmath49 100 nanometers this result is not rigorously exact .",
    "however , we still expect , in te polarization mode , a negligible particle contribution to @xmath50 compared to the total magnetic field intensity .",
    "analytical results presented in the previous section supply qualitative information about the spatial polarization state distribution . in a recent paper , analysis of polarization effects was proposed in the context of near  field optics in which a limited number of single particles were investigated@xcite . since in many practical situations experimentalists",
    "are interested in lithographically designed structures , these preliminary analyses must be completed by _ ab initio _",
    "procedures for solving maxwell s equations .",
    "recently , theoretical modelling in the vicinity of localized objects was performed in the framework of the field susceptibility method@xcite .",
    "today , this method is one of the most versatile and reliable numerical techniques to solve the full set of maxwell equations for the typical parameters of near  field optics .",
    "it works well even for metallic nanostructures ( see for example references@xcite ) .",
    "this approach ( called the direct space integral equation method ( dsiem ) ) is based on the knowledge of the retarded dyadic tensor @xmath51 associated with a reference system which , in our problem , is a flat silica surface@xcite .",
    "the numerical procedure considers any object deposited on the surface as a localized perturbation which is discretized in direct space over a predefined volume mesh of n points @xmath52 . in a first step , the electric field distribution @xmath53 is determined self - consistently inside the perturbations ( i.e. , the source field ) . at this stage , a renormalization procedure associated to the depolarization effect",
    "is applied to take care of the self - interaction of each discretization cell .",
    "the final step relies on the huygens  fresnel principle to compute the electromagnetic field @xmath54 on the basis of the knowledge of the field inside the localized perturbations @xmath55 .",
    "the two main computational steps can be summarized as follows :    _ ( i ) local field computation inside the source field _",
    "@xmath56 where @xmath57 labels the generalized field propagator of the entire system ( localized object plus bare silica surface ) . in the @xmath58 representation",

    "susceptibility of the entire system .",
    "this last quantity is usually computed by solving dyson s equation : @xmath63 _ ( ii ) electric and magnetic near  field mapping computation around the source field region _",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 in the numerical work to be discussed in this section , the retarded propagators @xmath66 and @xmath67 have been chosen in reference@xcite .",
    "object we consider in this section is the word * optics * engraved at the surface of a @xmath68 layer deposited on a silica surface .",
    "intentionally we have chosen a planar structure devoid of any symmetry . in order to gain more insight in the polarization changes occurring around such complex lithographically designed nanostructures ,",
    "we analyze in figs .",
    "( 4)-(7 ) the electric and magnetic near  field intensities generated by each cartesian component ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) and ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) . for comparison ,",

    "the lateral dimensions of the object are given in fig .",

    "the optical index of the @xmath75 pattern is 20 nm and 2.1 , respectively .",
    "the wavelength of the incident laser is 633 nm . all fields are computed 10 nm above the surface of the structure , i.e. 30 nm above the glass - air interface .",
    "[ dm ]    the incident light is a tm / te  polarized evanescent surface wave traveling along the @xmath76 axis . this illumination condition is used in the photon scanning tunneling microscope ( pstm ) .",
    "some general comments can be made about these results .",
    "first , all components of both the electric and magnetic fields have been excited in the near - zone .",
    "the occurence of these new components is a pure near  field effect because it is always localized around the structures . in figs .",
    "( [ e_te ] ) and ( [ e_tm ] ) we display the electric field part . as predicted in section 2 , we recover the appearance of two additional components , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , when the object is excited by a te  polarized surface wave . in agreement with the pstm results ,",
    "numerous regions appear with a dark contrast and a moderate intensity level .",
    "as expected , the excellent image  object relation currently observed in the tm ",
    "polarized mode is mainly provided by the field component @xmath78 normal to the object .",
    "the two other contributions tend to slightly degrade the total pattern @xmath79 composed by the superposition of the three maps @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the magnetic near  field intensity maps ( cf . figs .",
    "6 , 7 ) also show a significant confinement of the magnetic field over the particle which reverses the contrast with respect to the electric map . similarly",
    "to what happens with the electric field , the role played by the additional components can degrade the topographic information contained in the complete field maps .",
    "notice in fig.(6 ) that , as mentioned in section [ dipol ] , the new y - component of the magnetic field is very small compared to the total magnetic field .      in the above formalism , the only parameter distinguishing metallic from dielectric objects is the linear susceptibility @xmath80 .",
    "alternative procedures can be adopted to describe the metallic susceptibility .",
    "for example , a direct route would consist in expanding the susceptibility in a multipolar series around the geometrical center of the metallic particle .",
    "while this scheme allows non  local and quantum size effects to be included , it is nevertheless restricted to simple particle shapes ( spheres , ell0ipsoids , etc . ) .",
    "when dealing with spherical metallic clusters having a typical radius below 15 nm this description is mandatory and can be easily included in the dsiem formalism@xcite . for the applications discussed in this paper , involving lithographically designed metallic structures larger than this critical size",
    ", we can adopt the discretization of @xmath80 over all the volume occupied by the particle . in this case , the local susceptibility is just related to the metal optical index @xmath10 by the relation@xcite : @xmath81 in the visible range , the numerical data for describing both real and imaginary parts of @xmath10 have been tabulated by palik@xcite for different metals .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "( [ e_tm_gold ] ) a gray scale representation of the electric field distribution computed above the topographical object depicted in fig .",
    "3 . in this case , the high optical metal index generates complex field patterns without clear relation to the topography .",
    "furthermore the possible excitation of localized plasmons reinforces this phenomena and some parts of the localized metal pattern ( e.g. the corners ) can even behave as an efficient light sources .",
    "when working with periodic surface structures , the localized green s function method described above is no longer applicable . but",
    "any figure can be decomposed in points ( direct space ) or fourier components ( reciproqual space ) .",
    "we thus can use two methods wether the real object contain few points or few fourier components . in the case of periodic gratings",
    ", the field distribution can be investigated with this second class of methods @xcite .",
    "the so  called differential theory of gratings ( dtg ) was originally developed twenty years ago to predict the efficiencies of one and two  dimensional diffraction gratings .",
    "based on a rigorous treatment of maxwell s equations , this method can also be used efficiently to determine the optical near  field scattered by three dimensional periodic objects . in the following subsection , in order to avoid a complete presentation of this well  established technique , we will only summarize the essential steps of the computational procedure .",
    "as in previous sections , we are interested in the electromagnetic near - field diffracted above objects engraved on an interface illuminated by total internal reflection . when using the dtg method@xcite , the electromagnetic field above the grating can be expanded in a fourier series @xmath82 where @xmath11 = @xmath83 = @xmath84 , @xmath85 represents either the electric field @xmath86 or the magnetic field @xmath87 .",
    "the 3d  wave vectors @xmath88 , associated with the harmonic @xmath89 obey the well - known dispersion equation @xmath90 the set of wave vector @xmath91 parallel to the surface are simply defined for each couple of integer numbers @xmath89 by @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote respectively the period of the grating along the 0x and 0y  directions . from eq .",
    "( [ kpar ] ) , it may be seen that the coefficient @xmath95 may be either real or purely imaginary .",
    "real values of @xmath95 correspond to radiative harmonics while imaginary values introduce evanescent components in the expansion ( [ diffracted ] ) .    in a general way",
    ", the six components of the electromagnetic field @xmath96 can be deduced from two independent parameters usually named _",
    "the principal components_. let us choose , for example , the y ",
    "components @xmath97 and @xmath98 as _ principal components_. it is a simple matter to show that the fourier y  components of the field just above the surface of objects can be expressed as a linear combination of the y  components of the incident field : @xmath99 the transmission coefficients @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 describe the coupling between the electric and magnetic harmonics composing the scattered and the incident field .",
    "these coefficients depend both on the geometry of the sample and on the angular conditions of incidence but not on the polarization of the incident light .",
    "the polarization of the incident plane wave is controlled by the values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 . from a numerical point of view",
    ", the transmission coefficients are obtained by the inversion of a complex square matrix whose dimension is @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath106 ( where @xmath108 is the total number of harmonics used to describe the scattered field in eq .",
    "( [ diffracted ] ) ) .",
    "columns of this matrix contain the fourier y  components of the electromagnetic field which would have illuminated the periodical objects in order to obtain a pure harmonic field @xmath89 just above the nanostructure .",
    "a detailed description of the calculation of the matrix elements can be found in refs .  .",
    "with eq .",
    "( [ coucou ] ) , we can calculate all the fourier components of electric and magnetic fields just above the objects , which are used as initial conditions to obtain the field anywhere .",
    "general remarks about contrast , relative intensities and image - object relation have been made previously ( see sections [ smode ] and [ dm ] ) , therefore we only highlight the specific electromagnetic properties of periodic structures .",
    "we studied a lattice of @xmath109 nm@xmath110 @xmath75 dots , separated by @xmath111 nanometers .",
    "a strong localization of the electric field appears above the pads in tm - polarized mode or between the pads in te - polarized mode .",
    "moreover , a careful analysis of the different components shows that it is possible to create a particular field map such as field lines oriented along y - axis ( @xmath112 in te - mode ) or x - axis ( @xmath77 in tm - mode ) , or periodic field spots with very different characteristics ( spot size , periodicity and shape ) considering the other components in the two polarization modes .",
    "these particular field components distribution could have a great interest for the interaction of cold atoms with optical evanescent waves @xcite .",
    "unlike what happens with electronic surface states , the local density of photonic states ( the so  called photonic ldos ) contains information related to the polarization of the excitation field .",
    "it is well established that the density of states near surfaces plays a significant role in near  field physics @xcite . in particular , the photonic ldos is a useful concept for the interpretation of fluorescence decay rate in the very near ",
    "field @xcite and could help in understanding image formation produced by illuminating ",
    "probe snom @xcite . by referring to the electric field",

    "we can verify that both x  ldos and y  ldos are almost identical with just a rotation of @xmath117 between them .",
    "nevertheless , this properties does not subsist any more if we reinforce the optical coupling between the dielectric posts .",
    "more precisely , certain arrangements of nanoscale pillars ( circular or ellipsoidal ) can force light waves into states generated by the collective coupling between the pillars leading to significant difference between x  ldos and y  ldos maps .    moreover , although optical ldos characterizes the spectroscopic properties of an electromagnetic system independently of the illumination mode , it is interesting to note the strong analogy between the dark contrast over the pads obtained for y  ldos and the dark contrast that appears in the case of s - polarized illumination mode ( i - e incident electric field along the y - axis ) observed in section [ smode ] .",
    "in addition , as in the case of optical near ",
    "field maps discussed in the previous section , the _ polarized _",
    "ldos s can display significant discrepancies relatively to the shapes of the underlying objects .    finally , let us note that partial ldos s are not only a powerful mathematical tool but can easily be linked to the physical properties of electromagnetic systems .",
    "the most famous example is the fluorescence lifetime @xmath118 of a molecule near an interface which critically depends on the spatial ldos variation @xcite",
    "on the basis of both simple analytical model and sophisticated 3d maxwell s equations solvers this paper has focussed on the unusual behaviour of the light polarization in the near  field .",
    "when subwavelength patterned objects are excited by a surface wave of well  defined polarization , a complex rotation of the light polarization state can be expected in the near zone .",
    "this phenomenon localized around the scatterer is a typical near  field effect .",
    "the occurrence of new components is more pronounced in the electric field than in the magnetic part .",
    "subwavelength features are present in all components but with very different energy levels ."
