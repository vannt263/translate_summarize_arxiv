    "this article concerns the regularity of solutions to an elliptic boundary - value problem for the laplace operator on a polyhedral domain in @xmath0 under so - called _ ventcel _ or _ wentzell boundary conditions_. the regularity result we establish in weighted sobolev spaces gives rise , in turn , to _ a priori _ error estimates for the finite element method ( fem ) on a suitable anisotropic mesh .",
    "we first introduce the ventcel boundary - value problem .",
    "let @xmath1 be a bounded domain of @xmath2 with lipschitz boundary @xmath3 and let @xmath4 be an open subset of @xmath3 with positive measure .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the complement of @xmath4 , which we assume has also positive measure .",
    "we consider the following mixed boundary - value problem :    [ ventcel ] @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the standard ( euclidean ) laplacean in @xmath0 , @xmath8 is the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath3 , @xmath9 is the unit outer normal vector on @xmath10 , @xmath11 means the associated normal derivative , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are given data .",
    "this problem is a special case of a more general boundary - value problem , where is replaced by : @xmath14 which can be thought of as a generalized robin - type boundary condition .",
    "the more general problem is well posed only under conditions on the sign of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "ventcel boundary conditions arise naturally in many contexts . in the context of multidimentional diffusion processes ,",
    "ventcel boundary conditions were introduced in the pioneering work of ventcel @xcite ( see also the work of feller for one - dimensional processes @xcite ) .",
    "they can model heat conduction in materials for which the boundary can store , but not absorb or transmit heat .",
    "they can also be derived as approximate boundary conditions in asymptotic problems or artificial boundary conditions in exterior problems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , in particular in fluid - structure interaction problems .",
    "problem is known to have a unique variational solution if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are in the appropriate sobolev space as recalled in section [ sreg ] .",
    "we are concerned here with the higher regularity for solutions to this problem when the data is also regular , in the case that the domain @xmath1 is a polyhedral domain in @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that , due to the presence of edges and corners at the boundary of @xmath1 , even when @xmath4 is empty , elliptic regularity does not hold , and the solution is not smooth even if the data is smooth .",
    "this loss of regularity affects the rate of convergence of the finite element approximation to the solution if uniform meshes are used .    by using weighted sobolev spaces , where the weights are the distance to the edges and vertices , respectively , one can characterize precisely the behavior of the variational solution near the singular set in terms of singular function and singular exponents ( theorem [ tregu ] ) .",
    "in turn , the decomposition of the solution into a regular and a singular part , together with interpolation estimates ( theorem [ tinterpolation ] ) , leads to establishing _ a priori _ error estimates for the finite element approximation ( corollary [ cerrorestimate ] ) , where the elements are given on an anisotropic mesh that exploits the improved regularity of the solution along the edges versus the corners of the polyhedron .",
    "there is a well established literature on this approach for mixed dirichlet , neumann , and even standard robin boundary condition ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "there are also several works in the literature concerning the ventcel boundary - value problems on singular domains ( see in particular @xcite ) , and their implementation of the fem ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the novelty of this work consists in extending the approach using weighted spaces and anisotropic meshes to the ventcel boundary conditions , which include tangential differential operators at the boundary of the same order as the main operator in @xmath1 . as a matter of fact , the main difficulty in considering such boundary conditions lies in establishing the needed regularity of the traces on the faces of the polyhedron . for simplicity , we restrict here to the case where the ventcel condition is imposed on only one face of the polyhedron .",
    "if the ventcel condition is imposed on adjacent faces , one would expect higher regularity to hold for the solution on these faces , under suitable transmission conditions at the common edges .",
    "however , capturing this behavior entails studying weighted sobolev spaces for which the weight is the distance to the boundary and not the distance to the singular set ( as those arising from the analysis of equations with degenerate coefficients ) .",
    "we reserve to address this problem in future works .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sreg ] , we recall the variational formulation for problem , and prove our main regularity result for the solution in weighted spaces . in section [ sapprox ] , we introduce the anisotropic mesh and the associated finite element discretization of the problem , and derive _ a priori _ error estimates .",
    "section [ sinterror2d ] contains some refined 2d interpolation estimates valid on the polyhedral faces , needed for the error analysis .",
    "we close in section [ snumerics ] by presenting some numerical examples to validate the theoretical analysis .",
    "we end this introduction with some needed notation .",
    "if @xmath17 is a domain of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , we employ the standard notation @xmath20 to denote the sobolev space that consists of functions whose @xmath21th derivatives , for @xmath22 , are square - integrable .",
    "the @xmath23-inner product ( resp . norm ) will be denoted by @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "@xmath25 ) . the usual norm and semi - norm in @xmath26 , for @xmath27 ,",
    "are denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the trace operator from @xmath30 into @xmath31 will be denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "we also introduce the space : @xmath33 which is clearly a closed subspace of @xmath30 . if @xmath34 is a @xmath35-dimensional vector , we will write @xmath36 , although for ease of notation , we may write @xmath37 simply for @xmath38 .",
    "lastly , we employ the standard notation @xmath39 to denote the space of distributions on @xmath1 .    throughout , the notation @xmath40 is used for the estimate @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a generic constant that does not depend on @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the notation @xmath45 means that both @xmath40 and @xmath46 hold",
    ". we will also employ standard multi - index notation for partial derivatives in @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "the visit of the first author to penn state university and wayne state university , where part of this work was conducted , was partially supported through nsf grant dms-1312727 and the wayne state university grants plus program .",
    "in this section we recall needed facts about the well - posedness of the ventcel problem , and establish regularity estimates for its variational solution in weighted spaces .    the variation formulation of is well known ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we let @xmath51 which is a hilbert spaces equipped with the natural norm @xmath52    we further introduce the bilinear form @xmath53 as this bilinear form is continuous and coercive in @xmath54 , by the lax - milgram lemma , for any @xmath55 and @xmath56 , there exists a unique solution @xmath57 of [ weakform ] a(u , v)=_f v dx+__v g v d(x ) , vv .",

    "this regularity is no longer valid if @xmath17 is a non - convex polyhedral domain , and the main purpose of this section is to describe the behavior of the solution near the singular set , which consists of the edges and vertices of the boundary faces of the polyhedron , and characterize the regularity of boundary traces of @xmath60 and its derivatives .    to this end , we will employ anisotropic weighted sobolev spaces , for which the weights are ( variants of ) the distance to the edges and vertices , respectively .",
    "there is a vast literature concerning the use of weighted sobolev spaces in the analysis of singular domains ( we refer for instance to @xcite and references therein ) . in the context of the analysis of dirichlet / neumann boundary conditions ,",
    "anisotropic sobolev spaces were used in @xcite .    _ from now on we assume that @xmath17 is a polyhedral domain of the space and that @xmath4 is reduced to one face @xmath64 of the boundary . _    by a face , we mean an open face on the boundary .",

    "coordinate system centered at @xmath70 on the plane containing @xmath64 .",
    "in addition , we let @xmath71 be the interior angle on the face @xmath64 associated with the vertex @xmath70 .    following @xcite , we consider a triangulation @xmath72 of the domain @xmath1 that consists of disjoint tetrahedra @xmath73 .",
    "we will refer to each tetrahedron @xmath73 as a _ macro element _ , to distinguish it from the elements of the mesh utilized in the analysis of the fem in section [ sapprox ] .",
    "the purpose of the macro elements is to localize the construction and the regularity estimates near edges and vertices of @xmath1 .",
    "we will also refer to any edge or vertex of an element @xmath73 as a _ singular edge _ or _",
    "singular vertex _",
    "if that edge or vertex lies along a true edge or is a true vertex of @xmath1 and the solution is not in @xmath74 near that true edge or vertex .    we will assume that each @xmath73 contains at most one singular edge and at most one singular vertex .",
    "if @xmath73 contains both a singular edge and a singular vertex , that vertex belongs to that edge .",
    "we will also assume that all @xmath73 are shape regular with diameter of order @xmath75 .",
    "in each macro element @xmath73 , we introduce a local cartesian coordinate system @xmath76 , such that the singular vertex , if it exists , is at the origin , and the singular edge , if it exists , lies along the @xmath77-axis .",
    "we then define the distance functions to the set of singular edges and singular vertices , respectively , as follows :    [ eqn.dist ] r^()(x^())&=&,[eqn.r ] r^()(x^())&=&,[eqn.r1 ] and introduce the auxiliary function ^()(x^())&=&r^()(x^())/r^()(x^ ( ) ) [ eqn.r2 ] .",
    "we observe that @xmath78 , and @xmath79 extend as continuous functions to the closure of the macro element @xmath73 , while @xmath80 extends as a bounded function .    in",
    "what follows , we will omit the sup - index @xmath81 in these distance functions and in @xmath82 , when there is no confusion about the underlying macro element .",
    "given a subdomain @xmath83 , we define the following weighted sobolev space for @xmath84 and @xmath85 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 and @xmath89 , given in ( [ eqn.r1 ] ) and in ( [ eqn.r2 ] ) , if @xmath90 is represented by @xmath91 in local coordinates",
    ".    we will also need to define spaces on the faces of @xmath1 . to this end ,",

    "what follows , for ease of notation we will let @xmath106 be the trace @xmath107 of @xmath60 on the face @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , for a two - dimensional domain @xmath108 , we define the space @xmath109 , @xmath110 , as the closure of @xmath111 in @xmath112 .",
    "[ liso ] if @xmath113 is a two - dimensional domain with lipschitz boundary , then for any @xmath114 , the unique solution @xmath115 of @xmath116 belongs to @xmath117 for any @xmath118 .",
    "we fix @xmath118 .",
    "since @xmath119 is continuously and densely embedded into @xmath120 , by duality we obtain that @xmath121 is continuously embedded into @xmath122 .",
    "hence , @xmath123 can be seen as a solution of the laplace equation with datum in @xmath124 .",
    "owing to theorem 18.13 and remark 18.17/2 in @xcite , @xmath123 belongs to @xmath125 .",
