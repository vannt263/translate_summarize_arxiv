    "ideas spread in human society through education , public media , religious practices , literature publications , propaganda and rumors etc .",
    "while some ideas can easily spread out with virtually no resistance ( e.g. , the education of fundamental science in primary schools ) , others may have to be in face of competitions .",
    "the competitions can be mild or even hardly noticeable such as those between different opinions in rumor spreading , or rather fierce , e.g. , some violent conflicts between different religions in human history .",
    "while the spreading of an idea with no competitors , which to a certain extent is analogous to the spread of an infectious disease , has been extensively discussed @xcite , studies on dynamics of competing ideas are largely in absence .",
    "in fact , even the existing work on spreading of multiple competing viruses / pathogens is very limited .",
    "the majority part of the existing work is on analyzing competing viruses in well - mixed populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with no detailed modeling of the interactions between individuals .",
    "it is only in recent years that a few detailed studies have been conducted on interacting viruses with the aid of graph theory , considering ( i ) _ cross protection _ where individuals infected by one agent are immunized to the other @xcite ; ( ii ) propagations of two agents in two overlay networks @xcite ; and ( iii ) a special case where agent a induces agent b which in turn suppresses agent a @xcite , respectively . in social science , various voter models",
    "have been proposed for studying the dynamics of two different opinions .",
    "typically it is assumed that each voter may discard his own opinion and accept one of his randomly selected neighbors opinion instead ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such models help explain the coexistence of different opinions .",
    "yet the assumption that each individual has to accept one of the two opinions at any single moment ( s / he can not be left idle . ) makes such models quite specific for studying voter behaviors only .",
    "we argue that the spreading of competing ideas is very different from the spreading of competing viruses .",
    "an important feature of idea spreading is that an idea typically can generate some `` influences '' in a certain neighborhood area .",
    "individuals in the area may not necessarily accept the idea ; yet while under the influences , the chance that they accept a different competing idea is usually lowered , or even eliminated in some extreme cases .",
    "such a feature does not exist in most virus spreading cases , and to the best of our knowledge , has never been systematically studied in existing sociology research either .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on studying the effects of such neighborhood influences .",
    "specifically , we consider two representative types of neighborhood influences as follows :    * knowing that a close friend has accepted an idea may not immediately or finally make us accept the same idea .",
    "however , it usually lowers the chance that we accept a different idea , at least within a certain period of time @xcite .",
    "since the influence from the friend in this example does not eliminate the possibility that we accept a different idea , we term it as _ non - exclusive _ _ influence_. an interesting observation is that when under non - exclusive influence , people sometimes may finally accept multiple different ideas , say , by taking them as valid and valuable insights from different points of view . * in a region ruled by extremists , people may be prohibited from accepting any other idea , or be deprived of access to any competing ideas altogether @xcite .",
    "when such control is strictly implemented , the chance that people accept a different idea may be virtually zero .",
    "we term such cases as with _ exclusive influence_.    to evaluate the effects of exclusive and non - exclusive influences in idea spreading , we consider three different cases with two competing ideas where ( i ) both ideas have non - exclusive influences ; ( ii ) both have exclusive influences ; and ( iii ) the two ideas have non - exclusive and exclusive influences respectively .",
    "considering that many social networks closely resemble scale - free networks with power - law nodal degree distribution @xcite , we focus on studying the spreading of two competitive ideas in scale - free networks .",
    "for the spread of two competing agents with cross -protection in scale - free networks , it is easy to figure out that the two agents can always coexist in the steady state ( though a strict proof has never been published in any reference to the best of our knowledge ) . specifically , when two competing agents spread out in scale - free networks following the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) scheme @xcite , at any single moment neither of them can infect all the high - degree hub nodes , unless we assume that at least one of them has nearly infinite transmissibility .",
    "it is known that in sufficiently large scale - free networks , leaving a non - zero percentage of hub nodes unprotected causes persistent existence of infection @xcite .",
    "therefore the two agents definitely coexist in the steady state . for two competing ideas with exclusive and/or non - exclusive neighborhood influences",
    ", however , the dynamics is much richer .",
    "specifically , the main conclusions of our study can be summarized as follows :    * for competing ideas both with non - exclusive influences , they may have _",
    "multiple coexistence _ states : the final states of the two ideas with comparable transmissibility and strong neighborhood influences are determined by their initial densities ; while the idea with a relatively higher transmissibility can easily suppress its competitor to a low level . * for two ideas both with exclusive influences , they can _ never _ stably coexist in scale - free networks regardless of their respective transmissibility .",
    "the possible outcomes can be classified into _ founder control _",
    "@xcite , where the final winner is determined by the initial densities of the two ideas , or _",
    "exclusion _ where one idea steadily drives out the other .",
    "* for two ideas with non - exclusive and exclusive influences respectively , the one with exclusive influence has a chance to drive out its competitor altogether .",
    "however , this is guaranteed to happen only if its transmissibility is high enough compared to that of its competitor .",
    "since it typically takes nontrivial efforts ( energy ) to have exclusive influence in a neighborhood region , which may consequently lead to a lower transmissibility , it may _ not _ be a favorable strategy to try to have exclusive influence .",
    "in fact , for both the cases of non - exclusive influence vs. non - exclusive influence and non - exclusive influence vs. exclusive influence , when subject to limited resources , it helps enlarge the size of acceptance at steady state by focusing on increasing the transmissibility of the idea rather than weakening the neighborhood influence of the competitor .",
    "theoretical analysis and numerical simulations verify the above conclusions in random scale - free networks .",
    "the model is defined as follows . two competing ideas , hereafter termed as idea - i and idea - ii respectively , propagate in a scale - free network following the standard sis epidemiological scheme .",
    "we term idea - i as the idea - ii s _ competitor idea _ , and vice versa . for convenience ,",
    "an individual accepting an idea is termed as being _ infected _ by the idea ; and _ susceptible _ otherwise . a susceptible individual adjacent to one or more infected individuals",
    "is termed as being _ exposed _ to the idea . in a discrete unity time slot ,",
    "the two ideas have infection probabilities of @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively on those individuals exposed to only one of them . for individuals exposed to both of them ,",
    "the infection probabilities become @xmath2 for idea - i and @xmath3 for idea - ii , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are _ influential factors _ of idea - i and idea - ii respectively , @xmath6 .",
    "obviously , a smaller value of the influential factor corresponds to a stronger suppressing influence imposed by the competitor idea and a zero influential factor denotes that the competitor idea has exclusive influence .",
    "assume that individuals infected by idea - i and idea - ii are cured and become susceptible again at probabilities of @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively in unity time .",
    "the _ spreading rates _ of ideas - i and idea - ii can therefore be defined as @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively @xcite .",
    "note that in the proposed model , we assume that the chance of getting infected depends on the _ presence _ of infectious neighbors rather than the number of them",
    ". a different model can be proposed by assuming that each infected neighbor has an independent chance of transmitting the idea .",
    "in fact , both models have been extensively utilized in studies on virus and contagion spreading @xcite and they have always led to basically the same conclusions , with ( at most ) only some differences quantitatively . in this paper , we adopt the former model to allow simpler mean - field analysis .    to the best of our knowledge , the only existing work which may be regarded as loosely related to the general model above was reported in @xcite .",
    "the model there was on the spreading of two interacting rumors , one of which is always preferably adopted .",
    "it may be viewed as a special case of the proposed model where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , though in @xcite it was assumed that the two rumors can never co - infect an individual and it mainly studied the effects of network structures on coexistence of the rumors rather than dynamics of rumors with neighborhood influences .",
    "by adopting the mean - field theory @xcite , the spreading of two competing ideas in a random scale - free network can be analyzed .",
    "specifically , we assume that the population is of a fixed unit size and it can be modeled into a random scale - free network with degree distribution @xmath13 , where nodes represent individuals and links represent possible channels for idea spreading between adjacent individuals , and @xmath14 the probability that an randomly selected node has @xmath15 neighbors .",
    "term the densities of @xmath15-degree nodes infected by idea - i and idea - ii at time @xmath16 as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "since the instantaneous changing rate of the infection density by an idea equals the density of new infection minus the density of recovery , the time - evolution dynamics of the two ideas can be described by the following coupled equations : @xmath19   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times \\left ( \\left ( 1-\\theta _ { 2 } ( t ) \\right)^{k } \\nu_{1 } +   \\left [ 1-\\left ( 1-\\theta _ { 2 } ( t ) \\right ) ^{k } \\right ] \\alpha \\nu_{1 } \\right ) , \\label{eq-1a } \\\\",
    "\\frac{d\\rho _ { 2,k } ( t)}{dt } = &   -\\rho _ { 2,k } ( t ) \\delta_{2 } + \\left ( 1-\\rho _ { 2,k } ( t ) \\right ) \\left [ 1-\\left ( 1-\\theta _ { 2 } ( t)\\right ) ^{k } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times \\left ( ( 1-\\theta _ { 1 } ( t))^{k } \\nu_{2 } + \\left [ 1-\\left ( 1-\\theta _ { 1 } ( t ) \\right ) ^{k } \\right ] \\beta   \\nu_{2 } \\right ) , \\label{eq-1b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the probability that a randomly chosen link is connected to an individual infected by idea - i and consequently , @xmath21 the probability that a @xmath15-degree node is not directly connected to any node infected by idea - i . @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 are defined for idea - ii similarly .",
    "note that as pointed out earlier , we allow co - infection of two ideas on the same individual .    in a random scale - free network , the probability that a randomly chosen link points to a @xmath15-degree node equals @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the average nodal degree @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath20 and @xmath22 can be expressed as @xmath26 when the spread of the two ideas reaches the stationary state at time @xmath27 , @xmath28 in equations  ( [ eq-1a])-([eq-1b ] ) and @xmath29 in equations ( [ eq-2a])-([eq-2b ] ) .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath36 is always a solution of equations ( [ eq-3a])-([eq-3b ] ) . to have a non - zero solution of @xmath30 ,",
    "the following inequality @xmath37 must be satisfied @xcite . bringing the detailed expression of function @xmath38 in equation ( [ eq-3a ] ) into equation ( [ eq-4 ] ) and letting @xmath30 equal 0",

    "similarly , we can derive that idea - ii also persistently exists in scale - free networks .",
    "the coexistence of non - exclusive competing ideas in scale - free networks therefore can be verified .",
    "the detailed dynamics of the two ideas , however , can be rather complex .",
    "later we shall prove that the competing ideas may have multiple coexistences .",

    "we can predict the steady states and phase transition of the idea spreading .",

    "as we have proved earlier , equation  ( [ eq-3a ] ) always has a positive solution of @xmath30 for any @xmath43 regardless the value of @xmath35 .",
    "therefore the curve does not have an intersection with @xmath31-axis .",
    "the isocline in figure  [ fig_1b ] is similarly defined for idea - ii .",
    "the steady states of the two ideas are the intersections of the isoclines while plotting both of them in a single @xmath51-@xmath31 coordinate system @xcite , at which neither @xmath30 nor @xmath35 tends to increase or decrease .",
    "note that the intersections of the two isoclines ( also known as equilibriums ) , together with the intersections between the isoclines and the @xmath30-@xmath35 axes , are the possible final states of ideas @xcite .",

    "<S> individuals accepting an idea may intentionally or unintentionally impose influences in a certain neighborhood area , making other individuals within the area less likely or even impossible to accept other competing ideas . depending on whether such influences strictly prohibit neighborhood individuals from accepting other ideas or not , we classify them into exclusive and non - exclusive influences , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our study reveals for the first time the rich and complex dynamics of two competing ideas with neighborhood influences in scale - free social networks : depending on whether they have exclusive or non - exclusive influences , the final state varies from multiple coexistence to founder control to exclusion , with different sizes of population accepting each of the ideas respectively . </S>",
    "<S> such results provide insights helpful for better understanding the spread ( and the control of spread ) of ideas in human society . </S>"
