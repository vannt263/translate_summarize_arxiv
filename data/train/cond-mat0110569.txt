    "<S> the vanishing of the frequencies of these modes indicates that an instability occurs and that the quadratic approximation for the deformation is no longer valid . </S>",
    "<S> note however , that a small negative pressure tends to stabilize the @xmath73 mode - this is an alternative to salomaa and williams proposal for the stability of the @xmath63 mode , based on the assumption that the effective radius @xmath74    in this letter , we have shown that small negative pressures can stabilize a bubble against dynamic instability , while positive pressures can drive all ripplon modes unstable . </S>",
