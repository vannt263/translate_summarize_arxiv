    "the potts model , a generalization of the isling model to @xmath0 spin components introduced by potts @xcite in 1952 , has been at the forefront of research interest for almost five decades . while the critical properties of planar models are now largely known @xcite - @xcite , much less is known about their correlation functions .",
    "a key element of planar spin models is the notion of duality relations .",
    "every planar graph , or lattice , @xmath1 has an associated dual planar graph @xmath2 , and it is well - known @xcite that the partition functions of the potts model on @xmath1 and are proportional to each other when their couplings are correctly related . in the case of @xmath3 , the ising model ,",
    "it is also known @xcite that a duality relation exists between certain two - spin correlation functions .",
    "it has long been suspected that the correlations of the potts models on @xmath1 and @xmath2 should be similarly related .",
    "indeed , in a series of recent papers we have obtained correlation dualities for vertices ( spins ) residing on the boundary of one face @xcite - @xcite or two faces @xcite of @xmath1 , and reformulated the 1face results in graph - theoretical terms @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the @xmath4-face problem , namely , correlation duality relations for vertices residing on @xmath4 faces of @xmath1 for general @xmath4 .",
    "as we shall see , a new picture emerges for @xmath5 . instead of duality relations between individual correlation functions ,",
    "we now obtain relations between linear combinations of correlation functions .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we establish notations and briefly review the fortuin - kasteleyn ( f - k ) representation of the potts model , and derive the duality relation for the partition function . using two identities which we establish as lemmas , we introduce in section 3 a method which allows us to generate correlation duality relations .",
    "while our method does not necessarily generate all such duality relations , we show that generally the duality relates linear combinations of , rather than individual , correlation functions .",
    "explicit examples are given in section 4 and the relation to earlier results is explained . in section 5",
    "we reformulate our results in graph - theoretical terms as rooted dichromatic , or tutte , polynomials .",
    "consider a finite , planar connected graph @xmath1 with vertex set @xmath6 , edge set @xmath7 , and face set @xmath8 .",
    "we write @xmath9 for the size of the set @xmath6 and similarly for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and other terms .",
    "let @xmath10 denote an assignment of colors , or states , to the vertices of @xmath1 , which is a map from @xmath6 to the color set @xmath11 .",
    "then the partition function of the potts model on @xmath1 is [ def : z ] z = _ _ i , j e^ k ( _ i , _ j ) where the summation is over the @xmath12 coloring assignments @xmath10 , the product runs over all nearest neighbor spin pairs interacting with the coupling parameter @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the kronecker delta function , and @xmath15 is the color of the @xmath16-th vertex .",
    "the fortuin - kasteleyn ( f - k ) representation @xcite of the potts model replaces the configurational sum in ( [ def : z ] ) by a sum over edge sets .",
    "let @xmath17 be an edge set on the graph @xmath1 .",
    "if we remove from @xmath1 all the edges which are _ not _ in @xmath18 , we obtain a subgraph which contains all the vertices , and which in general has many connected components .",
    "this is called a spanning subgraph of @xmath1 .",
    "we write @xmath19 to denote the number of edges in @xmath18 , and write @xmath20 to denote the number of connected components in the spanning subgraph defined by @xmath18 . in this picture",
    ", any isolated vertex in the spanning subgraph counts as a connected component , and so contributes a summand 1 in the counting of @xmath20 .",
    "define [ def : v ] v = e^k - 1 so that we have [ fk ] e^ k ( _ i,_j ) = 1+v ( _ i,_j ) the substitution of ( [ fk ] ) into ( [ def : z ] ) now gives rise to the f - k representation of the partition function [ z - f - k ] z(g;q , v)z = _ s e v^|s| q^p(s)[part ] the number of colors @xmath0 appears as a variable in ( [ z - f - k ] ) , rather than a summation limit as in ( [ def : z ] ) .",
    "for this reason the f - k representation ( [ part ] ) forms the basis of essentially all analyses of the potts model .      as a precursor to discussions in later sections ,",
    "we give here a graph - theoretical derivation of the well - known duality relation for the partition function .",
    "the standard dual graph of @xmath1 is constructed by placing vertices in the faces of @xmath1 , and connecting them with edges which are transverse to the edges of @xmath1 .",
    "a pair of transverse edges are said to be dual to each other .",
    "the resulting dual graph @xmath2 has @xmath21 vertices , @xmath22 edges and @xmath9 faces , and is also planar . for a given edge set @xmath18 on @xmath1 , we define its dual edge set @xmath23 on by requiring that an edge of is in @xmath23 if and only if its dual edge is not in @xmath18 .",
    "thus , [ edgenumber ] |s|+|s^(d)|=|e| moreover , if we start from @xmath9 isolated vertices of @xmath1 , and add one by one the edges of @xmath18 , then each edge reduces @xmath20 by 1 unless it forms an independent cycle , in which case @xmath20 is unchanged .",
    "therefore we have the relation [ graphdual ] p(s ) & = & |v|-|s| + c(s ) + & = & |v|-|s| + p(s^(d))-1 where @xmath24 is the number of independent cycles in the spanning subgraph of @xmath18 , and is related to @xmath25 , the number of components in @xmath23 , through the topological relation @xmath26 . using ( [ edgenumber ] ) and ( [ graphdual ] ) we have the identity [ iden1 ] v^|s|q^p(s ) & = & v^|e|-    & = & k ( q / v)^|s^(d)|q^p(s^(d ) ) where [ k ] k = q^1-|f| v^|e| and we have used the euler relation [ euler ] |v|+|f| = |e| + 2 substituting ( [ iden1 ] ) into ( [ part ] ) , we see that the potts model partition functions on @xmath1 and @xmath2 are proportional , when the couplings @xmath13 and @xmath27 are related by the equation [ def : k^ * ] vv^ * = q where @xmath28 .",
    "the partition function duality is the statement that [ origdual ] z(g;q , v ) = k z(g^(d);q , v^ * ) where we have made use of the one - to - one correspondence between edge sets @xmath18 and dual edge sets @xmath23 .",
    "note that we have [ check ] kk^(d)= q^1-|f| v^|e| q^1-|v| ( v^*)^|e| = 1 which says that the dual of the dual partition function is the partition function itself .",
    "the potts correlation function is defined as the probability that a given set of vertices are assigned fixed colors @xcite .",
    "specifically , let @xmath29 be any subset of the vertices which are assigned fixed colors .",
    "we shall call these the _ roots _ for the correlation functions , and the graph with roots a _ rooted _ graph .",
    "let the @xmath30 roots lie on the boundaries of @xmath4 distinct faces of @xmath1 , which will be called the _ external _ faces of the graph . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume that external faces are not adjacent to each other , namely they do not share any vertices or boundary edges .",
    "let @xmath31 be any assignment of colors on the roots , so that @xmath32 is the color assigned to the root @xmath16 , and we write _ c ( ) = _ i r",
    "( _ i , c_i ) [ delta ] then the correlation function for the assignment @xmath33 on the root set @xmath34 is defined to be the expectation value of @xmath35 , namely , [ def : corr ] p_c _ c ( ) = z(g;q , v)^-1 _ _ c()_i , j e^ k ( _ i,_j ) where the summation in the right - hand side is a _ partial _ partition function . clearly , the explicit expression of @xmath36 depends on the location of the roots as well as the explicit color assignment @xmath33 .",
    "every color assignment @xmath33 defines a partition @xmath37 of the roots , namely a division of the @xmath30 roots into disjoint blocks , by the rule that two vertices @xmath38 in @xmath34 belong to the same block of @xmath37 if and only if @xmath39 . by the symmetry of the potts interactions ,",
    "the correlation ( [ def : corr ] ) depends only on this partition defined by @xmath33 , not on the specific colors .",
    "we can therefore associate each partial partition function to a partition @xmath37 .",
    "alternately , for any partition @xmath37 of the roots , we have a _ partial _ partition function [ def : z_x ] z_x z_x(g;q , v ) = _ _ c ( ) _ i , j e^ k ( _ i,_j ) where @xmath33 is any color assignment that produces the partition @xmath37 . since @xmath36 and @xmath40 are proportional , it is sufficient to discuss duality relations for the partial partition function @xmath40 .",
    "the f - k representation also extends to the partial partition functions . for any edge set @xmath18",
    ", we define a  connected \" partition @xmath41 of @xmath34 by the rule that two roots @xmath38 belong to the same block if and only if they belong to the same _ connected _ component of the spanning subgraph defined by @xmath18 .",
    "using this notion , we can separate the edge sets into classes [ def : cals1 ] s(x ) = \\{s e : ( s ) = x } labeled by their corresponding connected partitions of @xmath34",
    ". clearly every edge set @xmath18 belongs to exactly one of these classes @xmath42 .",
    "now the role of the factor @xmath35 in ( [ def : corr ] ) and ( [ def : z_x ] ) is to restrict the summations to fixed colors for vertices in @xmath34 .",
    "the net result is that each cluster containing roots contributes a factor 1 , instead of the factor @xmath0 in ( [ part ] ) .",
    "this leads us to define , for any partition @xmath37 , the summation over edge sets @xmath18 with @xmath43 , [ def : f_x ] f_x(g;q , v ) = _ s ( x ) v^|s| q^p(s ) -    the set of partitions of @xmath34 is partially ordered . we write @xmath44 to mean that every block in @xmath45 is wholly contained in a block in @xmath37 or , equivalently , @xmath45 is a refinement of @xmath37 .",
    "then we have the identity [ f - kcorr ] z_x(g;q , v ) = _ y x f_y(g;q , v )      it is well - known @xcite that the partially ordered sum ( [ f - kcorr ] ) can be inverted , allowing us to write @xmath46 as a linear combination of @xmath47 . for @xmath44 define the mbius inversion coefficient ( y , x ) = ( -1)^|y| - |x| _ bx [ mu ] ( n_b(y ) - 1 ) ! where the product on the right side runs over blocks @xmath48 in @xmath37 , and @xmath49 is the number of blocks of @xmath45 that are contained in @xmath48",
    ". then we have for every partition @xmath37 , [ mobius ] f_x(g;q , v ) = _ y x ( y , x ) z_y(g;q , v )    one peculiarity for planar graphs is that @xmath46 can be zero for certain partitions @xmath37 .",
    "this phenomenon was explored in detail in @xcite in the case of a single external face . in this case",
    ", one has @xmath50 if the partition @xmath37 is non - planar ( also called a crossing partition in the mathematics literature @xcite ) .",
    "it then follows from ( [ mobius ] ) that whenever @xmath37 is a non - planar partition , the partial partition functions @xmath47 must satisfy the identity _ y x ( y , x ) z_y(g;q , v ) = 0 [ mobius1 ] giving rise to  sum - rule \" relations for the partial partition functions @xcite . in general , when there are several external faces , identities of this type also hold for any root set @xmath34 , although it seems to be a hard problem to decide if a given partition is planar or not .",
    "in section 2.2 we introduced the dual graph @xmath2 , and described the well - known duality for partition functions on @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in this section",
    "we introduce the dual rooted graph @xmath51 which plays the corresponding role for correlation functions .    starting from a rooted graph with @xmath30 roots on @xmath4 external faces",
    ", one can construct a dual rooted graph @xmath51 .",
    "the procedure of constructing @xmath51 for @xmath52 has been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the construction of @xmath51 for general @xmath4 repeats the @xmath52 process for each external face , a prescription we now briefly describe .",
    "place @xmath4 extra vertices , one each in the center of each of the @xmath4 external faces .",
    "for each external face , let @xmath53 be the extra vertex and connect it to each root on the boundary of this face by an edge .",
    "this gives a new graph @xmath54 which has @xmath4 more vertices than @xmath1 and @xmath30 additional edges .",
    "the dual graph of @xmath54 is also planar , and it has @xmath4 faces containing the @xmath4 extra vertices @xmath53 . now remove all edges of these @xmath4 faces , and the resulting graph is the dual rooted graph @xmath51 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath51 residing inside the @xmath4 external faces of @xmath1 are now the dual roots and we denote this set by @xmath55 . clearly , the number of edges of @xmath51 is @xmath22 , and we have @xmath56 ( because external faces are non - adjacent ) .",
    "it is also clear that the total number of vertices of @xmath51 is [ vstar ] |v^*| = |f| + |r| -n    we can recover the standard dual graph @xmath2 from @xmath51 by _ fusing _ the dual roots @xmath55 inside each external face into a single dual vertex .",
    "this gives a one - to - one correspondence between edges on @xmath2 and @xmath51 , and hence we _ define _ the dual edge set @xmath57 on @xmath51 to be the same edge set as @xmath23 on @xmath2 .",
    "therefore in particular we have |s^*|=|s^(d)| let @xmath58 denote the graph generated by fusing all roots @xmath34 in @xmath1 , and @xmath59 the graph generated by fusing all roots @xmath55 in @xmath51 .",
    "then , we have the identities ( g^*)^(f ) = g^(d).5 cm and .5 cm g ^(f)=(g^*)^(d )      our results will depend crucially on the topology of the connectedness of the partitions @xmath41 and @xmath60 .",
    "fix an edge set @xmath18 on @xmath1 , and let @xmath61 , @xmath62 . recall that @xmath63 is the number of blocks in @xmath37 .",
    "also , let @xmath64 be the number of clusters of external faces on @xmath1 connected by @xmath18 ( where we define two external faces to be in the same cluster if a connected component of @xmath18 contains roots on both faces ) .",
    "similar definitions apply to @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    now @xmath57 and @xmath23 are the same edge set , and @xmath2 is obtained from @xmath51 by fusing",
    ". hence we have p(s^ * ) & = & |y| + + p(s^(d ) ) & = & n(y ) + where @xmath67 is the number of connected components in the spanning graph generated by @xmath57 that are _ not _ connected to any dual roots .",

    "the first identity , which we now state as a lemma , is a generalization of the identity ( [ iden1 ] ) .",
    "the new ingredient here is that the generalization should permit the consideration of the factor @xmath73 appearing in the f - k representation ( [ def : f_x ] ) .    for a fixed edge set @xmath18 on @xmath1 ,",

    "let @xmath18 and @xmath77 be edge sets which define the same partition of @xmath34 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath78 , then a key feature of the case @xmath52 is that their dual edge sets also define the same partition of @xmath55 .",
    "namely , [ pidual ] ( s ) = ( t )  if , andonlyif   ( s^ * ) = ( t^ * ) , n=1 this feature permits us to derive correlation duality relations for @xmath52 @xcite - @xcite . but",
    "( [ pidual ] ) is false for @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "however a weaker statement holds which we now state as a lemma .",
    "first , some definitions : a block of @xmath37 is _ local _ if it contains roots from one face only , and is _ non - local _ otherwise .",
    "a partition @xmath37 is local if every block of @xmath37 is local , and is non - local if any block in @xmath37 is non - local .",
    "given a partition @xmath37 , we can construct from it a unique local partition @xmath80 as follows : we split up every non - local block into a collection of local blocks , by separating its roots which lie on different faces .",
    "the collection of all these local blocks is the new partition @xmath80 .",
    "see fig . 1 for an example .",
    "any local partition is a collection of planar partitions of the roots on each of the external faces .",
    "each of these planar partitions on a single face has a unique dual partition .",
    "so for any local partition @xmath81 , we will define @xmath82 to be the collection of these dual partitions on @xmath51 , and by extension we will call it the dual partition of @xmath83 .",
    "notice that @xmath82 is always a local partition on @xmath51 .    for",
    "any edge set @xmath18 on @xmath1 , we have [ iden2:1 ] ( s^*)_loc ( s)_loc^ * furthermore , let @xmath18 and @xmath77 be two edge sets on @xmath1 , and suppose that @xmath78 .",
    "then we have [ iden2:2 ] ( s^*)_loc = ( t^*)_loc    remark : the result corresponding to ( [ iden2:2 ] ) also holds on @xmath51 , namely , if @xmath84 then also @xmath85 .    proof : it is sufficient to establish the relations ( [ iden2:1 ] ) and ( [ iden2:2 ] ) for each external face separately .",
    "so pick one external face , call it @xmath53 , and let @xmath86 denote the roots which belong to this face , and @xmath87 their dual roots .",
    "we will construct two different @xmath52 rooted graphs from @xmath88 , as follows ( recall that a rooted graph is an _ ordered pair _ , consisting of a graph together with a set of roots .",
    "mostly we have ignored the distinction between graph and rooted graph , but we will distinguish them throughout this proof ) .",
    "first , by ignoring the roots on the other faces we obtain the rooted graph @xmath89 . as a shorthand we will denote this pair by @xmath90 .",
    "second , by fusing the roots on the other external faces ( but not on @xmath53 ) we obtain a different rooted graph @xmath91 , which also has roots only on the face @xmath53 .",

    "each of these rooted graphs has a dual rooted graph , which we denote by @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively .",
    "these are constructed according to the procedure described in section 3.1 for the @xmath52 case , using only the roots on the face @xmath53 .",
    "notice that the underlying graph of @xmath94 is identical to the graph @xmath51 , because the process of fusing roots on a face in @xmath1 automatically splits the dual vertex in @xmath2 to produce the dual roots . as a convenient shorthand we write @xmath95 to denote the pair @xmath96 , which is obtained from @xmath51 by ignoring the roots on the other faces .",
    "it follows then that [ iden : graph1 ] ( g^f_f)^ * = ( g^*)_f    now let @xmath18 be an edge set on @xmath1 . since the underlying graphs of @xmath90 and @xmath97 have the same edges as @xmath1 , @xmath18 also defines partitions of the roots @xmath86 on @xmath90 and @xmath97 . for clarity in this proof",
    ", we write these partitions as @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively , where we include the graph in order to distinguish them .",

    "this duplicates the results of @xcite .",
    "if all roots lie on distinct faces , so that @xmath119 , then our method produces just one relation , namely the original duality ( [ origdual ] ) .",
    "we use the two lemmas to generate correlation duality relations .",
    "the definition ( [ def : f_xy ] ) was not useful because it involved a sum over all edge sets @xmath18 with fixed partition @xmath105 and fixed dual partition @xmath106 . as we now show , one way to generate duality relations is by summing instead over all edge sets with _ fixed local _ partitions @xmath80 and @xmath120 . according to ( [ iden2:1 ] )",
    "each of these must be a refinement of the dual of the other , so we can restrict attention to such pairs of local partitions .",
    "accordingly , writing = x_loc , = y_loc we say that @xmath121 are _ compatible _ if [ compat ] ^ * ^ *    let @xmath121 be compatible local partitions , and define a collection of edge sets on @xmath1 as follows : [ def : cals2 ] s ( , ) = \\{s e : ( s)_loc = , ( s^*)_loc = } for ease of notation , we write @xmath122 for the collection of edge sets on @xmath51 which are dual to those in @xmath123 .    in general , for a given pair @xmath124 , the set @xmath123 may be empty .",
    "( for example , in the case @xmath52 this happens unless @xmath125 ) .",
    "however if @xmath123 is not empty , then ( [ iden2:2 ] ) implies that it must have the following form ( recall the definition ( [ def : cals1 ] ) ) [ union ] s ( , ) = s(x_1 ) ( x_m ) for _ some _ collection of partitions @xmath126 .",
    "the reason is clear : suppose that @xmath127 and that @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath77 be any other edge set with @xmath129 .",
    "then by definition also @xmath130 , and by ( [ iden2:2 ] ) , @xmath131 .",
    "hence also @xmath132 , hence @xmath133 .",
    "we postpone for a moment the question of determining _ which _ partitions occur on the right side of ( [ union ] ) .",
    "first we will use this relation to write the sum over edge sets in @xmath123 as a sum over factors @xmath134 defined in ( [ def : f_x ] ) . recalling the left side of ( [ iden1 ] ) , and using ( [ union ] ) and ( [ def : f_x ] ) we get the following identity : [ eqn1 ] _ s ( , ) v^|s| q^p(s ) - [ |(s)| - n((s))]/2 & = & _ j=1^m _ s ( x_j ) v^|s| q^p(s ) - [ |(s)| - n((s))]/2 + & = & _ j=1^m q^[|x_j| + n(x_j)]/2 f_x_j +    next we use our first identity . using ( [ iden1 ] ) we can rewrite the left side of ( [ eqn1 ] ) as [ eqn2 ] _ s ( , ) v^|s| q^p(s ) - [ |(s)| - n((s))]/2 = k _ s^ * ( , ) ^ * ( v^*)^|s^*| q^p(s^ * ) -[|(s^*)| - n((s^*))]/2 now we repeat for @xmath51 the argument leading to ( [ union ] ) , and obtain [ union * ] s ( , ) ^ * = s(y_1 ) ( y_l ) for some collection of partitions @xmath135 of @xmath55 .",
    "hence we end up with the analog of ( [ eqn1 ] ) , namely [ eqn1 * ] _ s^ * ( , ) ^ * ( v^*)^|s^*| q^p(s^ * ) - [ |(s^*)| - n((s^*))]/2 = _ i=1^l q^[|y_i| + n(y_i)]/2 f_y_i^ *    putting together ( [ eqn1 ] ) , ( [ eqn2 ] ) and ( [ eqn1 * ] ) we get [ eqn3 ] _",
    "j=1^m q^[|x_j| + n(x_j)]/2 f_x_j = k _ i=1^l q^[|y_i| + n(y_i)]/2 f_y_i^ * this is our new duality relation .",
    "as stated earlier , it relates a linear combination of @xmath46 to a linear combination of @xmath136 .",
    "now we turn to the question of which partitions can occur on the left - hand and right - hand sides of ( [ eqn3 ] ) .",
    "these are determined by the compatible pair @xmath121 via the relations ( [ union ] ) and ( [ union * ] ) . in order to decide which partitions occur in ( [ union ] ) and ( [ union * ] )",
    ", it seems to be necessary to work on a case by case basis , by starting with @xmath121 and examining each planar partition @xmath37 to see if it produces this pair .",
    "so partly to hide our ignorance , and partly to tidy up the notation , we define ( x ; , ) = similarly if @xmath45 is a partition of @xmath55 , then define @xmath137 if there is an edge set @xmath57 with @xmath138 and also @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and otherwise @xmath141",
    ". then we can rewrite ( [ eqn3 ] ) as [ eqn4 ] _ x ( x ; , ) q^[|x| + n(x)]/2 f_x & & + = k _ y ^*(y ; , ) & q^[|y| + n(y)]/2 f_y^ * , and this is precisely the form described in ( [ def : dualf ] ) .",
    "finally we use the mbius relation ( [ mobius ] ) to re - express ( [ eqn4 ] ) in terms of the partial partition functions .",
    "the result has the form ( [ def : dualz ] ) , namely [ ab ] _ w a ( w ) z_w = k _ u b ( u ) z_u^ * , where the coefficients are a(w ) = a(w ; , ) = _ x w ( w , x ) ( x ; , ) q^[|x| + n(x)]/2 and b(u ) = b(u ; , ) = _ y u ( u , y ) ^*(y ; , ) q^[|y| + n(y)]/2 to summarize , we have obtained a duality relation for every pair of compatible local partitions @xmath121 in the form of ( [ eqn4 ] ) . in some cases the relation is empty ; otherwise it is given by ( [ eqn4 ] ) .",
    "however , it must be emphasized that while we have obtained new duality relations for the partial partition functions @xmath40 , our prescription does not necessarily generate _ all _ duality relations ( in fact we know that it is incomplete in the case @xmath71 as described below ) .",
    "the generation of the complete set of dualities remains an open question .",
    "this case was examined in detail in @xcite ( see in particular figs . 6 and 7 ) , and we compare our results here with those in @xcite .",
    "label the roots @xmath142 on one face , and @xmath143 on the other .",
    "there are four local partitions on @xmath1 , namely @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( we follow standard notation for partitions ,",
    "so , for example , @xmath146 means that there are three blocks , containing roots @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 respectively ) .",
    "since there are also four local partitions on @xmath51 , there are 16 possible pairs @xmath121 .",
    "however , only 10 of these satisfy ( [ iden2:1 ] ) , so there are 10 possible duality relations ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "closer examination shows that only 5 of these pairs can occur as local partitions of edge sets .",
    "we write @xmath151 for the dual roots .",
    "the 5 possible pairs are [ 5 pairs ] = ( 1)(2)(3)(4 ) , & = & ( 1^*2^*)(3^*4^ * ) + = ( 1)(2)(34 ) , & = & ( 1^*2^*)(3^*)(4^ * ) + = ( 12)(3)(4 ) , & = & ( 1^*)(2^*)(3^*4^ * ) + = ( 12)(34 ) , & = & ( 1^*)(2^*)(3^*)(4^ * ) + = ( 1)(2)(3)(4 ) , & = & ( 1^*)(2^*)(3^*)(4^ * )    there are 15 partitions of the 4 roots on @xmath1 , and they are all planar , namely , each one can occur as @xmath41 for some edge set @xmath18 . by our basic result ( [ union ] ) each partition is associated with one of the five pairs in ( [ 5 pairs ] ) .",
    "similarly the 15 partitions of the dual roots are each associated with one pair . in table 1",
    "we show these associations .",
    "the 5 duality relations are now obtained by substituting into ( [ eqn3 ] ) .",
    "for example , the third pair in ( [ 5 pairs ] ) gives the identity [ third pair ] & q^5/2 & f_(12)(3)(4 ) + q^3/2 f_(123)(4 ) + q^3/2 f_(124)(3 ) + & = & k [ q^5/2 f_(1^*)(2^*)(3^*4^ * ) + q^3/2 f_(1^*3^*4^*)(2^ * ) + q^3/2 f_(2^*3^*4^*)(1^ * ) ] this reproduces a result in @xcite . )",
    "is the same as eq .",
    "( 29 ) of @xcite , after the substitutions @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and renaming roots @xmath154 , and dual roots @xmath155 . ]",
    "similarly the first , second and fourth pairs in ( [ 5 pairs ] ) reproduce three other identities in @xcite .",
    "however the last pair in ( [ 5 pairs ] ) produces an identity which is the _ sum _ of two independent identities in @xcite .",
    "the general case @xmath71 is similar to the example above .",
    "the present method reproduces many but not all of the duality identities discovered in @xcite . in @xcite a non - local block in a partition @xmath37 was called a _ bridge _ , and @xmath37 was called a _",
    "@xmath157-bridge partition _ if it contained @xmath157 bridges ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "it was found that there exists one independent duality relation corresponding to every @xmath159-bridge partition , and in addition one independent relation for every @xmath157-bridge partition with @xmath160 .",
    "our method here reproduces all the duality relations for the @xmath159-bridge partitions , but _ not _ for the @xmath157-bridge partitions for @xmath161 . in the latter case it combines @xmath157 independent relations into a single relation",
    "this was the case in the previous example , where the two relations for @xmath162 were combined into a single relation .",
    "as an illustration of our method we consider the case where there are three external faces , each containing two roots .",
    "roots @xmath142 are on face 1 , roots @xmath143 are on face 2 and roots @xmath164 are on face 3 .",
    "the dual roots are @xmath165 etc .",
    "the number of local partitions of @xmath34 is 8 , since there are two choices on each face .",
    "hence the total number of pairs @xmath121 of local partitions on @xmath34 and @xmath55 is 64 .",
    "the number of compatible local pairs is 27 .",
    "after closer analysis , it turns out that only 15 of these pairs can be realised via edge sets .",
    "hence our method produces 15 independent duality relations corresponding to these 15 allowed pairs .    for brevity",
    "we present just one of these relations , corresponding to the following local pair : [ one pair ] = ( 12)(3)(4)(5)(6 ) , = ( 1^*)(2^*)(3^*4^*)(5^*6^ * ) instead of writing out the identity , we list in table 2 the 13 partitions which occur on the left - hand side of ( [ eqn3 ] ) , and the 9 dual partitions that occur on the right - hand side , along with the exponents of @xmath0 .      in general it seems to be a hard problem to determine exactly the number of compatible local partitions which can produce duality relations .",
    "however our method does provide a lower bound on this number .",
    "if @xmath83 is a local partition of @xmath34 , then certainly @xmath166 is not empty , and hence there is always a duality relation for this compatible pair .",
    "the number of such relations is the product of the number of planar local partitions on the faces .",
    "for example , if @xmath167 and the roots are paired on the faces , then the number of relations is at least @xmath168 .",
    "in 1955 tutte @xcite introduced in graph theory the notion of dichromatic , or tutte , polynomials , which turns out to be precisely the potts partition function . for our purposes and to conform with notations of @xcite , we define the tutte polynomial associated with a graph @xmath1 as the two - variable polynomials [ tutte ] q(g;t , v ) & = & v^-|v|   z(g ; vt , v ) + & = & v^-|v|_s e t^p(s)v^|s|+p(s ) where we have @xmath169 . similarly , one defines as in @xcite the rooted tutte polynomials [ rootedtuttexy ] q_x(g;t , v ) & = & v^-|v|   z_x(g ; vt , v ) + q_x , y(g;t , v ) & = & v^-|v|   z_x , y(g ; vt , v ) and the associated summations h_x(g;t , v ) & = & v^-|v| f_x(g;vt , v ) + h_y(g^*;v , t ) & = & t^-|v^*| f_y(g;vt , t ) + h_x , y(g;t , v ) & = & v^-|v| f_x , y(g;vt , v ) + h_y , x(g^*;v , t ) & = & t^-|v^*| f_y , x ( g;vt , t ) then , the duality relation ( [ origdual ] ) for the partition function becomes v  q(g;t , v ) = t  q(g^(d);v , t ) and lemma 1 assumes the form v^1-|v|+|x|-n(y ) = t^1-|v^*|+|y|-n(x ) likewise , the @xmath52 correlation duality ( [ nonedual ] ) becomes v^|x|  h_x(g;t , v ) = t^|y|  h_y(g^ * ; v , t ) n=1 and the duality ( [ ndual ] ) becomes v^|x|t^n(x)-1  h_x , y(g;t , v ) = t^|y|v^n(y)-1",
    "h_y , x(g^ * ; v , t ) furthermore , the relation ( [ eqn3 ] ) for general @xmath4 can be written as [ eqn31 ] & & v^1-|v| + ( |r|-n)/2 _ j=1^m ( vt)^[|y_i| + n(y_i)]/2 h_x_j + & & = t^1-|v^*| + ( |r|-n)/2 _ i=1^l ( vt)^[|y_i| + n(y_i)]/2 h_y_i^ * these expressions reflect the symmetric roles played by the variables @xmath170 and @xmath169 .",
