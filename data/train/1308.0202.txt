    "the decay widths of @xmath15 and @xmath2 to @xmath3 are illustrated in subplots ( c ) and ( e ) of figure [ charmdecayeta0 ] for isospin symmetric hadronic matter ( @xmath202=0 ) , with the medium modifications of the masses of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 mesons , but not of the charmonium state .",
    "due to drop in the mass of @xmath3 pair in the medium , the decay of @xmath15 to @xmath3 becomes kinematically admissible above a density of around 0.6@xmath209 , as seen in subplot ( c ) .",
    "the decay of @xmath2 to @xmath3 is already possible in vacuum , which however is modified in the medium due to mass drop of the @xmath3 pair .",
    "as has already been mentioned , the medium modifications of the decay widths are through the magnitude of @xmath56 , the 3-momentum of the @xmath6 meson . for both of the excited charmonium states , @xmath210",
    "is seen to increase with density , when only the mass modifications of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 mesons are considered .",
    "this leads to an increase in the polynomial part of the decay width upto a density of about 2.3@xmath209 ( 1.6@xmath209 ) for @xmath15 ( @xmath2 ) , when the decay widths of @xmath15 and @xmath2 attain values of around 34 mev and 169 mev respectively . as the density",
    "is further increased , the gaussian parts dominate due to increase in @xmath210 with density , thus leading to a drop in their decay widths .",
    "the fall off with density is observed to be slower for the nuclear matter ( @xmath203=0 ) as compared to for hyperonic matter .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath210 has a higher value in hyperonic matter as compared to in nuclear matter , since the masses of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 mesons have smaller in - medium masses with strangeness in the medium . when the in - medium masses of the charmonium states are also included , the partial decay widths of the excited charmonium states , @xmath15 and @xmath2 ( plotted in subplots ( d ) and ( f ) ) , are seen to be modified significantly . for hyperonic matter ,",
    "there is seen to be initially a sharp rise in the decay width with density ( reaching a value of around 25 mev at a density of 4@xmath209 for @xmath15 , and around 100 mev at a density of @xmath209 for @xmath2 ) .",
    "the increase , however , is observed to be a slower as the density is further increased .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath210 becomes smaller with the in - medium charmonium mass , which leads to much lesser suppression arising from the gaussian part of the decay width at high densities , as compared to the case when the charmonium mass modification is not taken into account .",
    "we then consider the effects of the isospin asymmetry on the charmonium decay widths .",
    "the masses of the @xmath73 and @xmath199 , as well as for @xmath74 and @xmath200 are no longer degenerate in the asymmetric hadronic medium , thus leading to the charmonium decays to @xmath152 and @xmath9 to be different . in figure [ charmdecayeta5 ] , the decay widths of the charmonium states",
    "are shown for asymmetric hadronic matter with @xmath202=0.5 .",
    "these are plotted for the hyperonic matter with strangeness fraction @xmath203=0.5 and compared to the values for nuclear matter ( @xmath203=0 ) . when the medium modifications of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 mesons are considered , but not of @xmath0 , then the decay channels to ( i ) @xmath152 and ( ii ) @xmath9 are observed to be admissible at densities higher than around 3.6@xmath209 and 4@xmath209 respectively , as can be seen from subplot ( a ) of figure [ charmdecayeta5 ] .",
    "the density dependence of the decay widths still remains similar to the case for the isospin symmetric hadronic matter plotted in figure [ charmdecayeta0 ] .",
    "however , the values of the decay widths turn out to be larger in magnitude as compared to case of the symmetric hadronic matter , with values of the order of 0.5 mev at a density of about 5@xmath209 .",
    "there is seen to be very small change in the decay widths when the in - medium mass for @xmath0 is included , with the threshold values for the decay to @xmath152 and @xmath211 being modified to 3.7@xmath209 and 4.1@xmath209 respectively , as can be seen in subplot ( b ) of figure [ charmdecayeta5 ] .",
    "the decay widths of the excited charmonium states @xmath15 and @xmath2 are plotted as functions of density in ( c ) and ( e ) of figure [ charmdecayeta5 ] , including the medium modifications of the masses of the d and @xmath12 mesons , but not of the charmonium states . the density dependence of these decay widths are seen to be similar to the isospin symmetric matter shown in figure [ charmdecayeta0 ] . in nuclear matter , the isospin asymmetry dependence is observed to be quite appreciable leading to very different values for the charmonium decay widths to @xmath152 and @xmath9 .",
    "this is due to the reason that in the presence of hyperons , the mass modifications of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 masses are lessened , as can be seen from figure [ mdasym ] .",
    "this leads to a much lesser effect from the isospin asymmetry in the hyperonic medium as compared to in nuclear matter , as can be seen from the figure . with in - medium charmonium masses ,",
    "the value of @xmath210 becomes smaller , leading to slower drop of the decay width of the charmonium states at higher densities , as can be seen from the subplots ( d ) and ( f ) of figure [ charmdecayeta5 ] .",
    "in asymmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath202=0.5 ) , the charmonium state @xmath15 is observed to decay to @xmath152 at densities higher than about @xmath209 , whereas the decay to @xmath9 becomes possible at densities higher than about 3.6@xmath209 .",
    "the decay of @xmath2 to @xmath152 is seen to have an initial rise upto a density of about 2@xmath209 reaching a value of about 38.5 mev at 2@xmath209 , followed by a slow increase as the density is further increased . on the other hand ,",
    "the decay to @xmath9 does not become admissible above a density of about 2.5 @xmath209 . in hyperonic matter , the density behaviour of the decays of @xmath15 and @xmath2 remain similar to the case of symmetric hadronic matter plotted in figure [ charmdecayeta0 ] and with inclusion of in - medium charmonium masses , the isospin dependence still remains small for the hyperonic matter .",
    "the partial decay widths of the charmonium states as calculated in the present composite hadronic model are now compared with the earlier results using the @xmath21 model @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we show the decay widths obtained from the @xmath7 model @xcite in figures [ charmdw3p0eta0 ] and [ charmdw3p0eta5 ] for the isospin symmetric ( @xmath202=0 ) and isospin asymmetric ( @xmath202=0.5 ) strange hadronic matter for @xmath203=0.5 . as earlier ,",
    "the medium modifications of the decay widths are through @xmath210 , which is given in terms of the masses of the charmonium state , @xmath4 and @xmath12 mesons by equation ( [ pd ] ) .",
    "the expressions for the decay widths of the charmonium states in the @xmath21 model are also of the form of a polynomial part multiplied by a gaussian part @xcite .",
    "the density dependence of the charmonium decay width is thus due to the combined effect of these contributions . for the excited charmonium states , @xmath15 and @xmath2 , when the medium modifications of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 mesons are considered , but not of the charmonium state , then the charmonium decay widths are initially seen to increase with density and then drop with further increase in the density .",
    "this behaviour on density leads to even vanishing of the decay widths at certain densities @xcite .",
    "there is seen to be an increase again at still higher densities . for both symmetric as well as asymmetric matter",
    ", the decay widths of @xmath15 as well as @xmath2 in the @xmath7 model , are seen to vanish ( see ( c ) and ( e ) of figures [ charmdw3p0eta0 ] and [ charmdw3p0eta5 ] ) .",
    "such nodes in the decay widths arising due to mass drop of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 mesons in the medium , have been discussed earlier in the literature @xcite for excited charmonium states decaying to @xmath3 pairs .",
    "a similar trend of the decay width with density is still observed when the mass modifications of the charmonium states are considered .",
    "however , no nodes are any longer observed even upto a density of about 6@xmath209 .",
    "the decay width of @xmath0 becomes kinematically accessible at densities higher than about 4@xmath209 ( 4.5@xmath209 ) with the in - medium masses of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 mesons , and without ( with ) the mass modification of @xmath0 . in isospin",
    "asymmetric hadronic matter , the decay widths for the charmonium state to @xmath152 is observed to be different from the decay to @xmath9 pair , due to difference in the masses of @xmath73 and @xmath199 of the @xmath4 meson doublet and of @xmath74 and @xmath200 of the @xmath12 doublet in the medium .",
    "similar to the charmonium decay widths of the present model for asymmetric matter shown in figure [ charmdecayeta5 ] , the @xmath7 also has a much stronger dependence on the isospin asymmetry in nuclear matter as compared to in hyperonic matter .",
    "this is due to the fact that the isospin asymmetry effect decreases with strangeness in the hadronic medium .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of the partial decay widths of the charmonium states to @xmath3 with density , calculated within the present composite hadron model , remains similar to their density dependence as calculated using the @xmath21 model .",
    "the values obtained for the decay width of @xmath2 calculated in the present investigation are very similar to those obtained by using the @xmath7 model .",
    "however , the values of the decay widths of the charmonium states , @xmath15 and @xmath0 , are observed to be much smaller in magnitude as compared to those obtained in the @xmath21 model . within the @xmath7 model ,",
    "there are seen to be nodes in the decay widths of the charmonium states , @xmath15 as well as @xmath2 when the in - medium masses of the @xmath6 mesons are considered , but the medium modification of the charmonium mass is neglected @xcite . however , in the present work , the decay widths do show a behaviour of an initial increase with density and then a drop , but no nodes are observed even upto a density of around 6@xmath209 .",
    "the decay width of @xmath18 in the hadronic medium has also been calculated in the present composite model for the hadrons .",
    "the production strength , @xmath191 for the creation of @xmath169 from @xmath11 is fitted from the decay widths , @xmath212 and @xmath213 of 29.5 kev and 65 kev respectively , and its value is estimated to be 4.3 . the in - medium decay width has been plotted in figure [ dstrdpi ] for the hyperonic matter ( with @xmath203=0.5 ) for the isospin symmetric and asymmetric matter ( with @xmath202=0.5 ) .",
    "the results have been compared with the situation of nuclear matter . for isospin",
    "asymmetric matter , the partial decay widths for @xmath214 as well as @xmath213 are observed to decrease with increase in density and vanish above the nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "the effects from the hyperons is seen to be marginal for the isospin asymmetric hadronic matter .",
    "however , the effects from strangeness fraction is seen to be appreciable for the case of isospin asymmetric matter , as can been from the figure [ dstrdpi ] .",
    "we now very briefly summarise the results .",
    "we have here investigated the in - medium partial decay widths of the charmonium states to @xmath3 pair , by using a composite model for the hadrons with quark and/or antiquark constituents .",
    "the decay width is calculated from a quark pair creation term which arises within the composite hadron model .",
    "the medium modifications of these partial decay widths are studied from the mass modifications of the charmonium and @xmath6 mesons within a chiral effective model @xcite .",
    "when the mass modifications of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 mesons are considered , but the charmonium mass taken as its vacuum value , one finds for the excited charmonium states @xmath1 and @xmath2 that the decay width increases initially with density , followed by a drop when the density is further increased .",
    "there is seen to be an appreciable modification of these decay widths when the changes of the charmonium masses in the medium , are also taken into account . in the present work as well as in the @xmath7 model ,",
    "the charmonium decay widths no longer seen to exhibit any nodes ( vanishing of these decay widths at certain densities ) , when the medium modifications of the charmonium states are also taken into account , in addition to taking the @xmath6 meson mass modifications into consideration .",
    "the isospin asymmetry effects are observed to be more dominant for the @xmath73 and @xmath199 , as compared to @xmath74 and @xmath200 .",
    "this leads to the partial decay widths of charmonium states to @xmath152 and @xmath9 to be different in asymmetric matter .",
    "the isospin asymmetry effects are however observed to be quite dominant in nuclear matter and these effects re observed to be much less in the presence of hyperons in the medium .",
    "the density effects on the charmonium decay widths seem to be the dominant medium effect as compared to the effects of the isospin asymmetry and strangeness in the hadronic matter .",
    "this should show up in experimental observables like production of the @xmath0 as well as @xmath6 mesons from the strongly interacting matter arising from the compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) experiment in the future facility at gsi .",
    "we note that parallel calculations could be useful for bottomonium in the context of future experiments . in the present work ,",
    "we have also calculated the @xmath16 decay width in the hadronic medium , using the composite hadron model , which may be relevant for the production of the open charm mesons arising from heavy ion collision experiments .",
