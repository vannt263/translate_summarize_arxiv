    "the abundance of dark matter in galaxies and the structure of the central engines of quasars are two interesting astrophysical problems that can be probed by gravitationally lensed quasars .",
    "the presence of point - like stars and their remnants in the otherwise smooth distribution of matter of the lens galaxy induces very strong local changes in the gravitational field that give rise to large changes in the magnification of the lensed source compared to a smooth model known as microlensing ( see the review by wambsganss 2006 ) .",
    "the amplitude of these anomalies is sensitive to the local stellar surface mass density fraction as compared to that of the dark matter at the image location ( schechter & wambsganss 2002 ) .",
    "it is also sensitive to the source size , because larger sources more heavily smooth the magnification patterns , and so are less magnified than smaller sources .",
    "both effects are important for the amplitude and statistics of the microlensing we see in the images of multiply imaged quasars .",
    "two basic experimental approaches have been used to measure microlensing in lensed quasars : photometric monitoring and single epoch spectroscopy / photometry .",
    "photometric monitoring measures the magnification changes ( microlensing variability ) induced by the relative motions of the quasar source , the lens galaxy stars and the observer ( chang & refsdal 1979 ; gott 1981 ; kayser , refsdal & stabell 1986 ) by comparing the light curves of the lensed images .",
    "after correcting the curves for the time delay between the images , the time varying microlensing signal can be analyzed ( e.g. kochanek 2004 ) .",
    "alternatively , if frequent monitoring of the source is not available , valuable information can still be extracted by using single epoch spectroscopy / photometry . in this case ,",
    "emission lines or a smooth macrolens model can be used as a reference with respect to which the microlensing of the different images can be measured .",
    "the advantage of using the emission lines as a reference is that they are much less sensitive to microlensing ( e.g. guerras et al .",
    "2013 ) and systematic errors in the macro lens model ( see mediavilla et al . 2009 , hereafter med09 ) .",
    "single epoch microlensing magnification estimates are observationally much less expensive than photometric monitoring , and can be easily obtained for relatively large samples of lensed quasars .",
    "the challenge is to adequately control for the systematic uncertainties in the reference magnification created by time variability , lens substructures and absorption / extinction .",

    "2012 ) separately .",
    "however , since microlensing is sensitive to both physical effects , some degeneracy was expected in the microlensing based estimates of these parameters ( see med09 ) .",

    "( 2015 ) found that despite the strong covariance , a determination of both parameters was still possible .",
    "as x - ray microlensing has proven to be sensitive to both size and fraction of mass in stellar mass objects , it is reasonable to wonder whether there is also a covariance between these two parameters for x - rays , similar to what is found at optical wavelengths , and how it may affect the estimates of both parameters . a joint study of both parameters using x - ray microlensing estimates is therefore needed to clarify this point .    beyond measuring a mean value for the stellar mass fraction at an average radius , @xmath12",
    ", measuring the radial profile @xmath12 is a key ingredient in understanding how galaxies formed ; in particular the interaction of dark and baryonic matter during the initial collapse ( including processes like baryonic cooling , settling , star formation and feedback ) and subsequent mergers ( cf . diemand & moore 2011 ) .",
    "most studies addressing this issue use other methods ( x - ray emission , dynamics or strong lensing ) to estimate total masses , and use the brightness / color distribution and a suitable imf to estimate the stellar mass ( see , for example , the review by courteau et al .",

    "<S> we use x - ray and optical microlensing measurements to study the shape of the dark matter density profile in the lens galaxies and the size of the ( soft ) x - ray emission region . </S>",
    "<S> we show that single epoch x - ray microlensing is sensitive to the source size . </S>",

    "<S> this corresponds to a size of @xmath2 or @xmath3 1 light day for a black hole mass of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we simultaneously estimated the fraction of the local surface mass density in stars , finding that the stellar mass fraction is @xmath5 at an average radius of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the effective radius of the lens . </S>",
    "<S> this stellar mass fraction is insensitive to the x - ray source size and in excellent agreement with our earlier results based on optical data . by combining x - ray and optical microlensing data </S>",

    "<S> we find that the surface mass density in the form of stars is @xmath8 and @xmath9 at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , in good agreement with expectations and some previous results . </S>"
