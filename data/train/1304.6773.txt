    "understanding detector response to low energy nuclear recoils is imperative to the interpretation of experimental results from a detector designed to search for wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) , a dark matter candidate .",
    "direct detection of low mass wimps occurs in the low energy region of detectors with a threshold down to sub kev .",
    "since the threshold energy represents the visible energy in the detector , understanding the ionization efficiency of the detector response to low energy nuclear recoils is crucial to calculating the recoil energy .",
    "an example of the need for this requirement is the claim of experimental evidence for dark matter by cogent  @xcite that has been unverified by cdms ii  @xcite .",
    "both experiments use germanium as the target material .",
    "thus , similar results are expected if the detection thresholds for both experiments were determined using a standardized ionization efficiency , which accurately accounts for all processes that occur at a low energy range .",
    "this standardized ionization efficiency must also be validated with measurements in combination with reliable monte carlo simulations .",
    "two different approaches can be used for modeling ionization efficiency in germanium detectors  @xcite .",
    "one model , traditionally used for a number of different detector materials , is proposed by lindhard _ et .",
    "@xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath1 = 0.133@xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 = 11.5@xmath8 for a given atomic number , @xmath9 , mass number , @xmath10 , and recoil energy , @xmath11 .",
    "however , this model has not been proved accurate at low energies as the theoretical derivation has uncertainties in this region  @xcite .    another model designed for low energy interactions in germanium",
    "was proposed by barker and mei  @xcite .",
    "this model takes into account the fraction of nuclear stopping power that contributes to the ionization efficiency at low energies  @xcite .",
    "the barker - mei model can be expressed as : @xmath12}.\\ ] ] this model is valid for recoil energies , @xmath13 , from 1 kev to 100 kev .",
    "however , the barker - mei model has not been experimentally verified .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address that issue .",
    "a comparison between the two models and existing data was performed  @xcite , and fig .",
    "[ fig : bmlindwdata ] shows both models together with available experimental data .        as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bmlindwdata ] , the two models agree in the low energy region but disagree with the available data points in the same region",
    ". further validation of the lindhard and barker - mei models , using more measurements and more accurate monte carlo simulation , was necessary .",
    "taking exact nuclear recoil measurements can be challenging at lower energies when systematic errors are introduced by a variety of sources .",
    "for example , thermal neutrons and elastic / inelastic scattering have their own uncertainties . utilizing thermal neutrons requires the full absorption of out - going gamma rays measured by another detector in coincidence . without this additional measurement ,",
    "compton scattering from out - going gamma rays within the germanium detector can contaminate the visible energy . in a measurement of neutron elastic scattering , a monte carlo simulation",
    "must be incorporated to exclude multiple scatters .",
    "it is also necessary to precisely measure the scattering angle and time - of - flight of the out - going neutrons .",
    "with inelastic scattering , the compton scattering due to de - excitation of gamma rays in the detector can contaminate the signal .",
    "all of these techniques need to be implemented with an accurate monte carlo that reduces systematic errors in order to obtain a reliable ionization efficiency",
    ". however , current popular simulation tools often need to be tuned to simulate inelastic scattering processes .    therefore , we desired a simple method to accurately measure nuclear recoils in germanium .",
    "the @xmath0 transition of germanium-72 ( @xmath14ge(n , n@xmath15e ) ) , which is the internal conversion process for this nucleus , was chosen .",
    "the @xmath0 transition of @xmath14ge(n , n@xmath15e ) is induced when neutrons inelastically scatter off a @xmath14ge nucleus .",
    "after this collision , the @xmath14ge nucleus is left in an excited state .",
    "when the nucleus returns to ground state , it does not directly produce a gamma - ray ( as is common for other nuclei ) , but interacts electromagnetically with the inner shell electrons and causes one to be emitted from the atom  @xcite .",
    "the physics process for the internal conversion of @xmath14ge can be generalized as : @xmath16 where @xmath14ge@xmath17 denotes the excited 0@xmath18 state .",
    "the total detectable energy from the @xmath14ge@xmath17(0@xmath18 ) to @xmath14ge(0@xmath18 ) transition is 691.6 kev , which includes energy from the x - ray .",
    "this energy is well within the visible range of traditional detectors , and both electron and x - ray can be detected with a consistency of approximately 100% .",
    "the characteristic energy , 691.6 kev , is superimposed with the nuclear recoil of a @xmath14ge nucleus to form a quasi - triangular shape , which is distinguishable from other processes in the spectrum .",
    "thus , we can observe low energy nuclear recoils without taking low energy nuclear recoil measurements by extrapolating with the known quasi - triangular fit .",
    "this quasi - triangular shape , starting at 691.6 kev , has been studied in great detail  @xcite .",
    "the tail of the quasi - triangular shape comes from a combination of the 691.6 kev energy deposition and nuclear recoil energy due to neutron scattering .",
    "depending on the incident neutron energy and scattering angle  @xcite , nuclear recoil energy can be expressed as : @xmath19 where e@xmath20 is the nuclear recoil energy , e@xmath21 is the neutron energy , m is the nucleus mass , m is the neutron mass , and @xmath22 is the scattering angle between the incident neutron and the recoil nucleus .",
    "the quasi - triangular shape is created by adding the energy from the nuclear recoils to the 691.6 kev energy deposition : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the observed energy and @xmath7 is the ionization efficiency .",
    "the nuclear recoil energies can be determined using a monte carlo simulation with applied ionization efficiency , if an agreement with the measurements is obtained .    to validate the ionization efficiency models proposed by lindhard and barker - mei , a geant4.9.2-based monte carlo simulation package  @xcite , corrected for the internal conversion processes , was used .",
    "this simulation package was verified using a well - calibrated @xmath25co radioactive source with the same experimental setup .    utilizing the spectrum measurements with a substantiated monte carlo simulation",
    ", we compared the unique quasi - triangular shape induced by the 691.6 kev electrons and nuclear recoils in the data to the monte carlo simulations for the two models .",
    "shape analysis was used to verify the quasi - triangular shape of spectra in the data and monte carlo simulations by analyzing data points in the region of interest .",
    "we found a good agreement between the measurements and the lindhard ( with @xmath1 = 0.159 ) and barker - mei models .    in this paper",
    ", we corroborate the ionization efficiency models proposed by lindhard _",
    "et al _ and barker - mei with a neutron induced @xmath0 transition for @xmath14ge .",
    "the experimental design is discussed in section 2 , followed by data analysis in section 3 . the monte carlo simulation is demonstrated and validated in section 4 , and the comparison with data described in section 5 .",
    "section 6 summarizes our results .",
    "the germanium detector used in our experiment was an old coaxial detector from princeton gamma tech , model rg11b / c  @xcite .",
    "its linearity of energy response between consecutive calibrations was within 0.35% .",
    "however , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) was 7.1 kev at the 1173 kev @xmath25co peak , a factor of two worse in energy resolution than a new germanium detector . nevertheless , the detector was sufficient for measuring neutron induced internal conversion .",
    "we used an @xmath26am-@xmath27be ( ambe ) source with neutron energies ranging from @xmath281.0 to 11.2 mev , at a frequency of 100 hz  @xcite .",
    "an ambe neutron source produces neutrons in four discrete groups : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , which populate the ground state , the 4.443 mev level , the 7.65 mev level , and the 9.64 mev level of the @xmath33c product nucleus , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 group neutrons , accompanied by 4.443 mev gamma rays , dominate the production of neutrons in an ambe source  @xcite .",
    "this feature allowed us to set up a coincidence measurement using sodium - iodide ( nai ) detectors ( bicron model number 3m3/3  @xcite ) with a threshold of above 1 mev . utilizing this coincidence method , the nai detectors measured gamma rays while neutrons were detected with the germanium detector . this coincidence pattern",
    "required that the nai and ge detectors both trigger in order for an event to be recorded , suppressing random background events generated by gamma rays from surrounding materials .",
    "we took approximately 22 days of data with three nai detectors and 13 days of data with two nai detectors .",
    "due to low neutron emission , the source was placed on the center of the ge detector cap and held in place by electrical tape . when using three nai detectors , they were placed on the right , the left , and directly in front of the germanium detector .",
    "when using two nai detectors , they were placed on the right and on the left of the germanium detector .",
    "[ fig : expsetup ] shows the experimental set - up .",
    "the data acquisition was performed using a national instruments pxi-1031 system  @xcite and igor pro 4.07 software  @xcite .",
    "each run lasted approximately 4.5 days .",
    "the data from each individual run was added consecutively off - line using analysis code from the root software package  @xcite .",
    "evidence of the 691.6 kev @xmath0 transition peak can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : expdata ] .",
    "after 35 days , the number of events in the region of interest ( 675 @xmath28 765 kev ) was approximately 500 . this is consistent with the known neutron emission from the ambe source and the coincidence method , which suppresses random background events from gamma rays , as verified by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "because of the small sample size of valid data in the region of interest , the bin size in the histogram was set to 6 kev in order to mitigate statistical fluctuation . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : expdata ] , there are several peaks near the region of interest .",
    "we identified these peaks in order to help understand the processes that took place within our detector as well as possible sources of contamination .",
    "the first peak can be fitted using a standard gaussian distribution and linear background distribution .",

    "the peak at 511 kev is mainly from the annihilation of e@xmath40e@xmath18 pairs induced by cosmic rays passing through the surrounding materials with other minor contributions .",
    "most notable is the 4.443 mev induced e@xmath41e@xmath42 in the surrounding materials .",
    "the positrons can annihilate with electrons producing 511 kev gamma rays , which enter the germanium detector .",
    "the fitted central value of 508 kev is slightly lower than the expected 511 kev , but still within the margin of error for the given bin size .",
    "the remaining peaks can be fitted using a moyal distribution and linear background .",
    "the moyal distribution used is  @xcite : @xmath43{\\frac{1}{2\\pi}exp\\left[-\\left(r\\left(e - e_{mpv}\\right)+exp\\left[r\\left(e - e_{mpv}\\right)\\right]\\right)\\right ] } , \\label{moyalfit}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a constant and @xmath45 is the most probable value of energy deposition in the detector . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are physically significant parameters . the value of @xmath44 is related to the reciprocal of the stopping power and can be used to calculate average path length for particles in the medium .",
    "the most probable value of energy , @xmath45 , is the most common energy deposition in that region .",
    "these parameters are further discussed in section 3.3 and used to interpret the experimental data .",
    "the peak around 560 kev , is likely caused by events from @xmath46ge@xmath47 inelastic scattering . because of the small number of events , the fitting function was only partially accurate .",
    "the second peak at around 600 kev has the fitted parameters , @xmath44 = 0.06 @xmath2 0.02 and @xmath45 = 609 @xmath2 3.6 kev .",
    "this peak is likely the combination of inelastic scattering from @xmath48ge@xmath47 and the neutron capture on @xmath49ge , @xmath49ge@xmath50 .",

    "we also took a background spectrum using the coincidence method to identify any random coincidence .",

    "[ fig : expdatafitall ] .",
    "the background data was taken using two sodium iodide detectors ( see right of fig .  [",
    "fig : expsetup ] ) for 4.6 days .    after the background spectrum was collected , we subtracted it from the ambe data sets as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : bkrdsubtracted ] .",
    "the 511 kev peak was significantly reduced , verifying our conjecture on the main origin of this peak as induced pair production from cosmic rays in the surrounding materials .",
    "the subtracted data set was also fitted using a moyal distribution and linear background .",
    "it was found that the most probable value of energy deposition in the detector for the @xmath0 transition was 696 @xmath2 1.4 kev .",
    "thus the percent difference of the ambe data with and without background subtraction is 1.3% .",
    "we have identified the following sources of systematic error for our data analysis : the energy scale and the energy resolution .",
    "the associated energy scale error is 3 kev , which is from the fit of the known 511 kev peak .",
    "the center value of the fitted function was 508 kev which is a difference of 3 kev from the known value of the peak .",
    "this shift in energy is from the energy calibration used to convert to the energy scale . as stated previously , there was a 0.35% error in successive energy calibrations . using a more accurate energy scale to produce a peak at 511 kev caused other energy regions to become less accurate . for energy resolution ,",
    "the value from the 662 kev peak of @xmath52cs was used , it is nearest of the calibration sources to our region of interest .",
    "the energy resolution for this peak was 3.45 kev . adding two errors in quadrature , since they are independent of each other , causing the resulting systematic error to be 4.6 kev .",
    "thus , the larger bin size of 6 kev was used to accommodate for this error .",
    "statistically , there are approximately 500 events in the region of interest ( 675 kev @xmath28 765 kev ) which gives a statistical error of 4.5% . for data with the background subtracted out ,",

    "the density of germanium is @xmath53 = 5.323 @xmath64 .",
    "since electronic stopping power is different from nuclear stopping power , the value of @xmath44 is very different for pure electronic recoils than nuclear recoils .",

    "these values are in agreement with the lindhard and barker - mei models in the energy range of 1 to 100 kev .",
