    "the schwarzschild spacetime is the simplest model of a universe containing a star .",

    "a more remarkable fact is that the schwarzschild metric is the only spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the einstein equations .",
    "spacelike constant mean curvature ( ) hypersurfaces in spacetimes have been considered important and interesting objects in studying the dynamics of spacetime and in general relativity .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more discussions on the importance of hypersurfaces . from the viewpoint of geometry",
    ", a hypersurface in spacetimes has extremal surface area with fixed enclosed volume @xcite .",
    "this property is similar to that of a compact hypersurface in euclidean spaces .    in this paper , we study spacelike spherically symmetric constant mean curvature ( ) hypersurfaces in schwarzschild spacetimes and kruskal extension .",
    "we solve hypersurfaces in both exterior and interior of the schwarzschild spacetime , and then analyze their asymptotic behavior , especially at @xmath0 .",
    "the kruskal extension is an analytic extension of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "when hypersurfaces are mapped to the kruskal extension , we find relations between hypersurfaces in exterior and interior such that they can be joined smoothly .",
    "these statements can be seen in theorem  [ thm1][thm3 ] . furthermore , we get all complete hypersurfaces in the kruskal extension in theorem  [ thmall ] .",
    "our motivation on studying hypersurfaces is on one hand that they are easier to deal with and have explicit expressions , and on the other hand that these examples can serve as barrier functions for the general non - symmetric cases .",
    "we hope that a deep understanding of these solutions can help us to find right formulation of other general questions in the schwarzschild spacetime such as dirichlet problem and etc .",
    "after we finished the results in this paper , we found that the problem was also studied by brill , cavallo , and isenberg in @xcite , and malec , and  murchadha in @xcite .",
