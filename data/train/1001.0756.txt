    "in  @xcite we put the hypothesis that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can be the sources of ultrahigh energy particles in cosmic rays observed recently by the auger group ( see  @xcite ) due to the processes of converting dark matter formed by superheavy neutral particles into visible particles  quarks , leptons ( neutrinos ) , photons .",
    "such processes as it was discussed previously in  @xcite could lead to the origination of visible matter from the dark matter particles in the early universe when the energy of particles was of the grand unification ( gu ) order ( @xmath0gev ) i.e. at the end of inflation era .",
    "if agn are rotating black holes then in  @xcite we discussed the idea that `` this black hole acts as a cosmic supercollider in which superheavy particles of dark matter are accelerated close to the horizon to the gu energies and can be scattering in collisions . ''",
    "it was also shown that in penrose process  @xcite dark matter particle can decay on two particles , one with the negative energy , the other with the positive one and particles of very high energy of the gu order can escape the black hole .",
    "then these particles due to interaction with photons close to the black hole will loose energy analogously up to the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin limit in cosmology  @xcite .",
    "processes of converting dark matter particles into visible ones as well as collisions of dark matter particles close to the horizon of the black hole in the agn can play important role in the solution of the problem of cusps as it was discussed in  @xcite . according to the hierarchical model the galaxies were formed due to initial inhomogeneities of dark matter distribution .",
    "but after origination of rotating black holes at the centre of future galaxies large part of the dark matter became redistributed so that it can be mainly present in the halo of galaxy  @xcite .",
    "the problem of the origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) is a major unsolved issue in astroparticle physics .",
    "surely there can be different mechanisms of getting uhecr from agn .",
    "our aim is full investigation of the role of processes of collisions and decays of elementary particles close to the horizon of the kerr black holes in the agn .",
    "these particles can be superheavy particles of dark matter or usual protons , iron nuclei , etc . in the latter cases for usual particles to get large energy one must consider multiple scattering .",
    "first calculations of the scattering of particles in the ergosphere of the rotating black hole , taking into account the penrose process , with the result that particles with high energy can escape the black hole , were made in  @xcite .",
    "recently in  @xcite it was shown that for the rotating black hole ( if it is close to the critical one ) the energy of scattering is unlimited .",
    "the result of  @xcite was criticized in  @xcite where the authors claimed that if the black hole is not a critical rotating black hole so that its dimensionless angular momentum @xmath1 but @xmath2 then the energy is limited .    in this paper",
    "we show that the energy of scattering in the centre of mass system can be still unlimited in the cases of multiple scattering . in section",
    ", we calculate this energy , reproduce the results of  @xcite@xcite and show that in some cases ( multiple scattering ) the results of  @xcite on the limitations of the scattering energy for nonextremal black holes are not valid . in section   an evaluation of the time necessary for the freely falling particle to get the unbounded large energy in collision with the other particle in the centre of mass system is made .",
    "it is proved that in order to have infinitely large energy of collision on the horizon infinitely large time from the beginning of free falling of the particle on the rotating black hole is needed .",
    "particle collisions inside the rotating black hole are considered in section  . in section",
    ", we obtain the results for the extraction of the energy after collision in the field of the kerr s metric .",
    "it occurs that the penrose process plays important role for getting larger energies of particles at infinity .",
    "our calculations show that the conclusion of  @xcite about the impossibility of getting at infinity the energy larger than the initial one in particle collisions close to the black hole is wrong .",

    "gives : @xmath66 ( see  ( 8) in  @xcite ) .",
    "so even for values close to the extremal @xmath67 of the rotating black hole @xmath68 can be not very large as it is mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "so for @xmath69 considered as the maximal possible dimensionless angular momentum of the astrophysical black holes ( see  @xcite ) , from  ( [ kerrlimamax ] ) one obtains @xmath70 .",
    "does it mean that in real processes of particle scattering in the vicinity of the rotating nonextremal black holes the scattering energy is limited so that no grand unification or even planckean energies can be obtained ?",
    "let us show that the answer is no ! if one takes into account the possibility of multiple scattering so that the particle falling from the infinity on the black hole with some fixed angular momentum changes its momentum in the result of interaction with particles in the accreting disc and after this is again scattering close to the horizon then the scattering energy can be unlimited .",
    "the limiting value of the angular momentum of the particle close to the horizon of the black hole can be obtained from the condition of positive derivative in  ( [ geodkerr1 ] ) @xmath71 , i.e. going `` forward '' in time .",
    "so close to the horizon one has the condition @xmath72 which for @xmath73 gives the limiting value @xmath74 .    from",
    "( [ geodkerr3 ] ) one can obtain the permitted interval in  @xmath75 for particles with @xmath76 and angular momentum @xmath77 .",
    "in the second order in  @xmath78 close to the horizon one obtains @xmath79 if the particle falling from the infinity with @xmath80 arrives to the region defined by  ( [ kerrintl ] ) and here it interacts with other particles of the accretion disc or it decays on more light particle so that it gets the larger angular momentum @xmath81 , then due to  ( [ kerrlima ] ) the scattering energy in the centre of mass system is @xmath82 and it increases without limit for @xmath83 . for @xmath69 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "note that for rapidly rotating black holes @xmath86 the difference between @xmath74 and @xmath87 is not large @xmath88 for @xmath69 ,  @xmath89 so the possibility of getting small additional angular momentum in interaction close to the horizon seems much probable .",
    "that is why we come to a conclusion that unboundedly large energy can be obtained in the centre of mass system of scattering particles .",
    "this means that physical processes not only on the grand unification scale but even on the planckean energy can go in this case .    one can obtain the same result of getting unbounded large energy in the centre of mass frame for particles with different masses @xmath90 and @xmath91  @xcite",
    "however an important question is to look how particles with large energy can be extracted from the black hole ?",
    "some energy surely will be loosed due to the red shift , but as we ll show in this paper ultrarelativistic particles still can be observed outside the black hole .",
    "observation of them can give us insight into the grand unification and planckean physics near the horizon .    before answering on this question",
    "let us investigate the problem about the time needed for the energy to grow unboundedly large .",
    "let us show that in order to get the unboundedly growing energy one must have the time interval from the beginning of the falling inside the black hole to the moment of collision also growing infinitely .",
    "this is connected with the fact of infinity of coordinate interval of time needed for a freely particle to cross the horizon of the black hole ( for schwarzschild metric this question was considered in  @xcite ) .    from fig .",
    "[ emaxcmr ] one can see that the collision energy can get large values in the centre of mass system only if the collision occurs close to the horizon .",
    "unboundedly large energy of collisions outside of a black hole are possible only for collisions on horizon @xmath92 ( see  ( [ kerrl1l2 ] ) , ( [ kerrlima ] ) ) .    from equation of the equatorial geodesic  ( [ geodkerr1 ] ) , ( [ geodkerr3 ] ) for a particle with dimensionless angular momentum  @xmath93 and specific energy @xmath94 ( i.e. the particle is non relativistic at infinity ) falling on the black hole with dimensionless angular momentum  @xmath38",
    "one obtains @xmath95 so the coordinate time ( proper time of the observer at rest far from the black hole ) of the particle falling from some point @xmath96 to the point @xmath97 is equal to @xmath98    in case of the extremal rotating black hole ( @xmath67 , @xmath99 ) and the limiting value of the angular momentum @xmath100 the integral  ( [ kerrdelt ] ) is equal to @xmath101 and it diverges as @xmath102 for @xmath103 .    in all other cases , when @xmath104 and angular moment @xmath105 , integral ( [ kerrdelt ] ) diverges logarithmically if @xmath106 .",
    "this follows from equality @xmath107 note that for the particle with @xmath94 outside the horizon for @xmath108 the angular momentum @xmath109 ( see  ( [ kerrintl ] ) ) .",
    "so for all possible values of @xmath93 and @xmath38 to get the collision with infinitely growing energy in the centre of mass system needs infinitely large time .    for the interval of proper time of the free falling to the black hole particle one obtains from  ( [ geodkerr3 ] )",
    "@xmath110 if the angular momentum of the particle falling inside the black hole is such that @xmath111 then the proper time is finite for @xmath106 .",
    "for @xmath67 , @xmath100 the integral  ( [ kerrdeltau ] ) ) is equal to @xmath112 and it diverges logarithmically when @xmath103 .",
    "so to get the collision with infinite energy one needs the infinite interval of as coordinate as proper time of the free falling particle .    to get large finite energy one must have some finite time  @xcite .",
    "so to have the collision of two protons with the energy of the order of the grand unification one must wait for the extremal black hole of the star mass the time @xmath113s , which is larger than the age of the universe @xmath114s .",
    "however for the collision with the energy @xmath115 larger than that of the lhc one must wait only  @xmath116s .    from  ( [ geodkerr2 ] ) , ( [ geodkerr3 ] ) for the angle of the particle falling in equatorial plane of the black hole one obtains @xmath117 if @xmath118 , then integral  ( [ kerrdelphi ] ) is divergent for @xmath106 .",
    "so before collision with infinitely large energy the particle must commit infinitely large number of rotations around the black hole .",
    "as one can see from formula  ( [ kerrl1l2 ] ) the infinite value of the collision energy in the centre of mass system can be obtained inside the horizon of the black hole on the cauchy horizon  ( [ horcau ] ) .",
    "indeed , from  ( [ dxxhxc ] ) the zeroes of the denominator in  ( [ kerrl1l2 ] ) : @xmath119 .",
    "let us find the expression for the collision energy for @xmath120 .",
    "note that the cauchy horizon can be crossed by the free falling from the infinity particle under the same conditions on the angular momentum  ( [ geodkerr5 ] ) as in case of the event horizon .",
    "denote @xmath121 note that @xmath122 .    to find the limit @xmath123 for the black hole with a given angular momentum  @xmath38 one must take in  ( [ kerrl1l2 ] ) @xmath124 and do calculations with @xmath40 .",
    "the limiting energy has two different expressions depending on the values of angular momenta .",
