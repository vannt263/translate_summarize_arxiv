    "from the scaling hypothesis of localization @xcite it is well known that in one ( 1d ) and two dimensions ( 2d ) almost all states of a non - interacting disordered quantum system are localized @xcite .",
    "delocalized states occur only for special choices of physical parameters .",
    "an example of such a model is provided by the anderson model of localization with random hopping @xcite , @xmath2 the hopping elements @xmath3 between sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 are restricted to nearest neighbors and chosen randomly from the interval @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath7 represents the center and @xmath8 the width of the off - diagonal disorder distribution .",
    "the onsite potential energies @xmath9 are taken to be randomly distributed in the interval @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "we set the energy scale by keeping @xmath11 fixed and use periodic boundary conditions .    in this work",
    "we will concentrate on the properties of the random hopping model in 3d .",
    "we study the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "using tmm @xcite together with fss , we determine the mobility edge @xmath1 of the mit separating extended from localized states .",
    "we find that the off - diagonal disorder is not strong enough to localize all states in the spectrum in contradistinction to the usual case of diagonal disorder .",
    "we have numerically computed the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ eq - hamil ] ) for @xmath12 samples , system size @xmath13 and various values of @xmath7 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - dos ] we show the resulting dos for strong off - diagonal disorder @xmath14 and moderate @xmath15 . for @xmath14",
    "the peak at energy @xmath16 in the dos of the finite system is well pronounced .",
    "it corresponds to a logarithmic singularity in the infinite system @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dos ] ( left , inset ) . for larger values of @xmath7 , the off - diagonal disorder becomes weaker and the dos shows various sub - bands which reflect the spectral structure of the completely ordered model for @xmath17 .",
    "we remark that in the corresponding 2d model the smallest localization length and thus the strongest disorder was found at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the application of the tmm for the present case of random hopping relies on a reformulation of the schrdinger equation @xcite as @xmath19 with @xmath20 corresponding to the wave function at site @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 representing the hopping elements from site @xmath24 or @xmath25 respectively to site @xmath21 and @xmath26 the hopping element from @xmath27 to @xmath21 .",
    "this equation may be written in matrix from as @xmath28^{-1}(e - h_{\\perp } )    & -[{t^{||}_{n+1}}]^{-1 } { t^{||}_{n } } \\\\      1                &   0   \\end{array } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 denoting the wave function in the @xmath30 slice , @xmath31 the hamiltonian in the @xmath30 slice , and the matrix @xmath32 connecting the @xmath33 with the @xmath30 slice .",
    "as usual , the localization length @xmath34 is computed from the smallest lyapunov exponent @xmath35 of the @xmath36 eigenvalues @xmath37 of @xmath38 . here , @xmath39 .",
    "assuming the validity of one - parameter scaling close to the mit , we expect the reduced localization lengths @xmath40 to scale onto a scaling curve @xmath41 with scaling parameter @xmath42 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - fss ] we show the results up to @xmath43 at @xmath14 and @xmath44 .",
    "the crossing between extended states at @xmath45 and localized states at @xmath46 is clearly visible .",
    "the mobility edge is thus @xmath47 .",
    "the inset zooms into the mit region , where one can see an @xmath48-dependent shift of the crossing point towards smaller @xmath49 for increasing @xmath48 . due to this finite size effect , which is supposed to vanish for @xmath48 large enough ,",
    "we take non - linear and non - universal corrections to fss @xcite into account .",
    "the fss curve constructed from these data in fig .  [ fig - fss ] shows two branches similarly to the fss curves in the anderson model of localization with pure diagonal disorder @xcite .",
    "however , in contradistinction to the model with diagonal disorder , we find that the off - diagonal disorder at @xmath14 is not strong enough to localize all the states .    analysing data for larger values of @xmath7 , we find increasing localization lengths .",
    "consequently the mobility edge increases with increasing @xmath7 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - mobedge ] we show the results up to @xmath50 .    for larger @xmath7",
    "the transition observed for @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig - fss ] becomes less easy to detect and we obtain reasonably accurate crossings for large @xmath48 only .",
    "the crossing becomes sharp again when varying @xmath51 instead of @xmath49 .",
    "this allows us to determine the critical exponents @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the scaling parameter @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in agreement with recent results in the anderson model with pure diagonal disorder @xcite",
    "we find @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we have investigated the dos and the localization properties of the anderson model of localization with off - diagonal disorder .",
    "our results show that in 3d a finite part of the spectrum close to the band center remains extended even for the strongest off - diagonal disorder @xmath14 , whereas in 1d and 2d the off - diagonal disorder has non - localized states only for @xmath16 .",
    "fss is possible and we determine the mobility edge separating extended and localized states in the off - diagonal disorder vs.  energy phase diagram .",
    "the obtained critical exponents of the mits are in agreement with prior results for the model with only diagonal disorder @xcite and convincingly support the universality .",
