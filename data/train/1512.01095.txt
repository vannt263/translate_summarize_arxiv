    "one of the main factors precluding the observability of the extragalactic universe is the limitation in surface brightness ( sb ) by different surveys . in the seventies",
    ", different authors have shown that the universe is populated by low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) having much lower sb than the dark night sky @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed using data from ccd drift scans from the eighties , that one can expect about 4 galaxies / deg@xmath6 between the range 23 - 25 mag arcsec@xmath4 . in the nineties and already entering in the new millennium , there were no surveys with significantly fainter surface brightness limits .",
    "some progress on the statistical significance of the population of lsbgs has been made in recent years because of the higher volumes sampled , thanks to massive surveys like the sdss and others , but still barely reaching @xmath7 mag arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , and quite unexpectedly , @xcite reported on the discovery of a dozen of milky way ( mw ) sized , passively evolving , ultra diffuse galaxies ( udg ) in the coma cluster .",
    "this population is very likely dark - matter dominated and thus represents a challenge to the current theories of galaxy formation . without the presence of large fractions of dark matter in lsbgs",
    ", it is very difficult to prevent the rapid destruction of low density galaxies within a massive cluster like coma @xcite .    thus , there are still many unsolved issues concerning the nature of lsbgs",
    ". one of these issues is the nature of the class of the so - called giant lsbgs : large format spiral galaxies with a similar or larger size than the mw and very low sb .",
    "big spirals exhibiting similar morphologies of the grand design spiral galaxies like m31 and the mw , but with much lower stellar density , as described in , and references therein .",
    "the best and more extreme example in this category is malin 1 , a disk / spiral active galaxy @xcite with a disk sb of @xmath8 @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 , an uncertain inclination ( the hi data indicate that this galaxy has an inclination of about 50 deg ) , and a barred inner disk @xcite .",
    "in addition to this faint sb , what makes malin 1 exceptional is its size : about 110 kpc diameter in hi and presumably a similar or larger diameter in the optical , making this galaxy the largest one in the universe detected so far ( @xmath9 times the mw diameter ) .",
    "malin 1 was serendipitously discovered by @xcite in photographic plates .",
    "it is close to ngc 7145 in the virgo cluster , and near a bright star .",
    "this last feature prevents to obtain deep optical imaging easily without contaminating the fov with scattered light , imposing additional difficulties for observing its morphology .",
    "malin 1 has been studied so far in hi @xcite , and in the optical @xcite .",
    "it is from these studies that its huge size was measured .",
    "also , the hi data allow to estimate a hi mass of @xmath10 m@xmath11 , and a dynamical mass of @xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath11 , which makes malin 1 to be an enormous dark matter reservoir @xcite .",
    "the galaxy has been also an interesting target for spitzer @xcite and for sub - mm observations @xcite , both for searching warm and cold dust , as well as to detect emission from molecular clouds .",
    "these observational efforts failed subsequently , which means that malin 1 has a very low gas density and/or low dust content .",
    "these observational facts place malin 1 at the bottom end of the krumholz diagram @xcite , which relates the stellar formation efficiency and the gas surface density .",
    "in this diagram malin 1 is certainly one of the galaxies having the lowest stellar formation efficiency with one of the lowest molecular gas density .    in spite of the wealth of information for malin 1 , including hst imaging @xcite and ground - based observations @xcite",
    ", optical images usually lack of good quality and are not deep enough to detect features fainter than 24 @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "for example , hst observations of malin 1 @xcite are about 15 minutes exposure , reaching data basically for the bulge of the galaxy , but extremely shallow images for other structures , including the disk and the presumed spiral arms .",
    "@xcite built deep imaging of malin 1 co - adding @xmath14 images from 63 ukst photographic films digitally scanned by the supercosmos machine , covering the astonishing area of 36 deg@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite obtained spectroscopic observations for the central part of malin 1 to prove that malin 1b , a galaxy located 14 kpc from the malin 1 center , is interacting with malin 1 .",
    "but they do not provide optical imaging . also relevant for",
    "this discussion is the work by @xcite , which claim that malin 1 is a normal galaxy ( with a normal disk ) , embedded into a larger , more diffuse very low sb disk .",
    "however , in his analysis , barth uses the same @xcite hst images , which are relatively shallow ones . in summary , no deep , high quality ccd images are available for malin 1 .    in this letter",
    "we present deep optical images taken with megacam at the 6.5 m magellan / clay telescope .",
    "we exposed for about 4.5 hours in @xmath1 and @xmath0 , reaching @xmath2 @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 , which allows to observe for the first time features with unprecedented detail .",
    "we perform a careful reduction and we use a novel image processing in order to enhance data practically buried into the noise .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in ",
    "2 we present the observations and key steps in the data reduction , in  3 the main results and discussion .",
    "we conclude in  4 . through this paper",
    "we use h@xmath15 = 71 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 .",
    "observations were performed at the 6.5 m magellan / clay telescope using megacam with filters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , on the night of 25 april 2014 .",
    "the night was dark , moonless , a necessary restriction for low sb targets .",
    "the night was also photometric with a median seeing of 0.8 arcsec .",
    "exposure times were 4.8 hrs in @xmath1 and 4.2 hrs in @xmath0 ( individual images of 10 minutes ) .",
    "after cosmic rays rejection , individual images were flat - field and illumination corrected , then stacked , and properly combined ( see left panels of figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the flat - field and illumination corrections are critical steps .",
    "pixel to pixel variations along the images , as well as illumination inhomogeneities both can introduce mid- and large scale image artifacts that can be erroneously attributed to physical features of the target .",
    "in addition to the low sb of malin 1 , the field where the galaxy is located makes difficult to obtain deep images . first , a bright star of 8.5 mag ( bd+15 2483 ) is located 4.7 arcmin sw of malin 1 .",
    "second , the galaxy ngc4571 is located 6.6 south of malin 1 .",
    "these two sources generate scattered light and sky brightness which contaminate the already faint structure of malin 1 . to combine different frames ,",
    "synthetic background models were extracted .",
    "these models allow to remove large scale components preventing a proper match between frames .",
    "frame matching , image registration , image combination , and all further post - processing steps were done using pixinsight , co - developed by one of the authors of this letter @xcite .",
    "the average sky sb was 20.2 @xmath1 mag arcsec@xmath4 , and 21.8 @xmath0 mag arcsec@xmath4 , equivalent to @xmath19 @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 , using the filter transformations from @xcite .      given the extremely low sb nature of malin 1 disk / spiral arms , after the basic image processing described before ( calibration and image combining ) , we perform a more sophisticated procedure in order to enhance the signal . for this task we applied a noise reduction filter based on the _ total generalized variation regularizator _",
    "@xcite , tgv hereafter .",
    "this is similar to an anisotropic diffusion filter , promoting piecewise smooth images instead of piecewise constant images as is common with these filters .",
    "this denoising filter was applied to both @xmath1 and @xmath0 images .",
    "these were then integrated into a false color image , assigning @xmath1 data to the red channel , @xmath0 data to the blue channel , and using a weighted average to create a synthetic green channel .",
    "later , the images were de - linearized , by applying a histogram transform which uses the rational interpolation mid - tones transfer function described by @xcite .",
    "this provides more contrast to low signal features than a standard gamma transform . to enhance and isolate the structures of large diffuse objects , pinpoint sources ( i.e. stars )",
    "were removed from the images using an inpainting algorithm based on tgv .",
    "this separation between features is needed , because stars are very contrasted objects , and their signal dominates in the wavelet domain .",
    "direct filtering leads to gibbs or ringing artifacts , or could enhance structures that correspond to regions of different stellar density , instead of enhancing the smooth background signal . once those features are isolated , local contrast is enhanced using the starlet transform ( also known as _  trous wavelets _ ) @xcite .",
    "basically , the image is decomposed into layers with a redundant decomposition , isolating structures at certain characteristic sizes .",
    "wavelet coefficients are modified with multiplicative factors to enhance features at each layer .",
    "finally , small and large scale objects were combined again to achieve the images presented in right panels of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "all the processing steps were performed on a per - channel basis , and no information was transferred through them . to allow a better visual inspection of the image , an inverted and monochrome version is also presented ( bottom panels of figure [ fig1 ] , and figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .      in order to assess our sb limit , it is necessary to photometrically calibrate the images .",
    "we have observed landolt standards , and used the photcal package within iraf to obtain the photometric solutions .",
    "then , and knowing the pixel size ( 0.16 arcsec pix@xmath16 ) , we estimate that the sb we reach in our flat - corrected and combined images at @xmath20 is @xmath21 mag arcsec@xmath4 in the @xmath1 band and @xmath22 mag arcsec@xmath4 in the @xmath0 band , as observed in regions r3 and r6 labeled in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "these values translate to @xmath2 @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "this is @xmath23 mag arcsec@xmath4 fainter than the typical sb reached by surveys and other works to date @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows several panels where malin 1 is presented .",
    "left panels represent the stacked and combined images .",
    "right panels show the images with the aditional tgv treatment . in the top panels ,",
    "the combined rgb images of the field are presented ( see  2.1 ) . in the bottom panels , the inverted and monochrome version of the same image",
    "some morphological features are clearly seen , especially in the right panels .",
    "some of them observed for the first time .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows clear images of a face - on spiral galaxy presenting a bright inner region which reproduces the image from @xcite . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we compare with the hst / wfpc2 image from @xcite .",
    "the inner region of malin 1 appears much redder than any other structure visible in the galaxy .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show that malin 1 exhibits well formed spiral arms .",
    "this demonstrates that in ultra - faint disk lsbgs the spiral structure can be well developed to very faint surface brightness limits . in order to quantify the density contrast of the spiral arms",
    ", we can compare the estimated density of these structures with the stellar density in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the mw disk at the solar vecinity has a stellar mass surface density of @xmath24 m@xmath11 pc@xmath4 @xcite . from the same author ,",
    "the luminosity surface density is 25.6 l@xmath11 pc@xmath4 , or 23.5 mag arcsec@xmath4 in the @xmath3 band . converting the observed sb of @xmath2 @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 in luminosity surface density in solar units , we obtain @xmath25 l@xmath11 pc@xmath4 , i.e. about 62 times lower than the surface luminosity density in the solar neighborhood indicated above mag and a sb for the solar neighborhood of 27.02 mag arcsec@xmath4 . ] . using a mass - luminosity for our local volume of ( m / l)@xmath26 = 1.4 @xcite",
    ", we obtain a stellar mass column density of @xmath27 m@xmath11 pc@xmath4 , again , 62 times smaller than the 35.5 m@xmath11 pc@xmath4 in the local volume ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note that we do not correct these values for the effect of inclination on sb since our data suggest that malin 1 is almost face - on .    as shown in all figures",
    "we observe , for the first time , in full view , that malin 1 is far from having a featureless low surface brightness disk .",
    "it presents rich features suggesting stellar formation regions an well defined spiral arms .",
    "we emphasize that these are well developed structures , with an extremely low sb , which translates to extremely diffuse stellar density ( as shown above ) .",
    "the data then suggests that morphological structures as observed here , can be long lived in this kind of lsbgs , and could imply large concentrations of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the formation of spiral arms observed to such low stellar densities is another issue .",
    "this could be explained by the action of density waves in the matter distribution .",
    "however , such a theory is still in discussion by some authors @xcite . or perhaps a better explanation for the spiral structure of malin 1 is tidal driving or even shear driving @xcite , more consistent with the presumed past encounter between malin 1 and the galaxy sdssj123708.91 + 142253.2 , shown in the images of figure [ fig1 ] by the upper left arrow .",
    "we observe two diffuse and cigar - like features embedded in the disk of malin 1 , and seem to cross it radially . the shorter one labeled as a in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] is likely the disk of a galaxy with a bulge located at ra(j2000.0 ) 12:36:59 and dec(j2000 ) + 14:19:44 .",
    "the sdss database indicate that this object has a photometric redshift of 0.19@xmath28 , suggesting that this galaxy is in the background , i.e. about 30,000 km / s away from malin 1 .",
    "its morphology , undisturbed by the presence of malin 1 seems to confirm that its redshift estimate is correct .",
    "nevertheless , this value should be confirmed spectroscopically in order to ensure this galaxy is not interacting with malin 1 .",
    "the other , larger structure , labeled as b in figure [ fig3 ] and also apparent in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , does not present any bulge and its nature is unclear .",
    "we do not discard that may be we are observing the jet of the active galactic nucleus of malin 1 , classified as a liner from spectral data by @xcite , and as a high - excitation seyfert galaxy by @xcite .",
    "the other possibility , and perhaps the most likely , is that this feature is part of the claimed past interaction between malin 1 and the galaxy sdssj123708.91 + 142253.2 approximately 1 gyr ago , located at @xmath29 kpc from malin 1 @xcite ( indicated by upper arrows in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we note that this stream extends up to @xmath30 kpc from the center of malin 1 .",
    "we do not discard the relationship of these features with the presence of malin 1b ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) , discussed in @xcite .",
    "the presence of several diffuse regions in the spiral arms exhibiting morphologies similar to stellar formation regions and/or clumps of gas is apparent .",
    "examples of these clumps are labeled as r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 , r5 and r6 in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "three of these regions ( r1 , r2 and r3 ) are the same as those observed by @xcite with the iram 30 m telescope for detecting co , unsuccessfully , though .",
    "these three regions were selected by @xcite after original observations by @xcite .",
    "this is the first time that such regions are so well defined in optical images .",
    "one of the most impressive features of malin 1 is its large diameter . @xcite",
    "measured an optical diameter of 110 kpc , almost 6.5 times larger than the diameter of the mw , making malin 1 the largest disk / spiral galaxy in the universe so far .",
    "considering a redshift of 0.082 , a ccd pixel scale of 0.16 arcsec / pix , and the faintest spiral arm observed in the images shown in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , the optical diameter of malin 1 turn to be about 160 kpc ( 750,000 light years ) .",
    "this is about 50 kpc ( 163,000 light years ) larger than the diameter described by former authors @xcite .",
    "the double arrow in figure [ fig2 ] indicate a physical scale of 30.6 kpc , basically the size of the mw .",
    "images show that malin 1 is not only large , but also its spiral arms are scaled to gigantic proportions . some sections in spiral",
    "arms of malin 1 in figure [ fig2 ] measure @xmath31 kpc thick , i.e. approximately one third of the mw diameter .",
    "in this letter we have obtained deep optical images of malin 1 , the faintest and largest giant lsbg so far , to unprecedented depth .",
    "the galaxy is composed by an inner bright region , well differentiated from the outer part composed by spiral arms . the color difference between the inner part and the spiral arms also appear extreme , with the former much redder than the spiral arms .",
    "we clearly see spiral arms and other structures down to a sb @xmath2 @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 . comparing the resulting luminosity and stellar surface density of malin 1 spiral arms with that derived for the disk of our galaxy ,",
    "we obtain @xmath25 l@xmath11 pc@xmath4 and @xmath27 m@xmath11 pc@xmath4 , i.e. 62 times lower than those mw corresponding values . and",
    "yet , the galaxy exhibits a textbook and gigantic spiral structure , to these very low density values .",
    "this is certainly the most astonishing result of this work .",
    "how spiral arms can form and remain long - lived to these very low density contrast , is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "the deep @xmath0 and @xmath1 images reveal details for other features marginally observed in the past . in particular , we observe two conspicuous features with cigar - like morphology , crossing the spiral arms : one is very likely a background galaxy , and the other is a larger , faintest structure pointing to the galaxy sdssj123708.91 + 142253.2 , claimed by @xcite to had interacted 1 gyr ago with malin 1 . our imaging does not allow to conclude about the nature of this structure .",
    "other observed features seem to be stellar formation regions or gas clumps , some of them already observed by @xcite with the iram 30 m telescope in order to detect co , unsuccessfully , however .",
    "our data also confirm that malin 1 is even larger than previously reported , reaching 160 kpc diameter , i.e. more than 6.5 times the diameter of the mw .",
    "the fundamental result is that malin 1 appears , at last , in full view in optical bands , allowing to see features that were not revealed before to such a detail and contrast .",
