    "since the first experimental observations@xcite , the phenomenon of coherent backscattering ( cbs ) of light from disordered media has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental studies@xcite ( see also ref . for the most recent review ) .",
    "the underlying mechanism for the cbs was identified as interference of clockwise and counterclockwise scattering paths .",
    "this was understood already in the early works by analogy to weak localization of electrons .",
    "it has been also pointed out@xcite that this picture _ fully _ captures the physics of the coherent scattering only if there are no forbidden directions for the propagation of light in the absence of disorder .",
    "these forbidden directions emerge in systems with periodic spatial modulation of the dielectric function , or in other words , in photonic crystals with incomplete gaps@xcite . in the presence of periodicity ,",
    "the enhanced scattering of light may occur not only in the backscattering direction , but in other directions as well .",
    "roughly speaking , the additional peaks in the scattering intensity can be regarded as periodicity - induced diffraction satellites of the cbs peak .",
    "their origin is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "in the presence of the periodic modulation of the dielectric function , the light wave vector is determined only up to the vector @xmath0 of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "hence , upon entering the medium , light with wave vector @xmath1 acquires a satellite component with @xmath2 projection of the wave vector , @xmath3 .",
    "importantly , the same argument also applies for the coherently backscattered light with wave vector @xmath4 , when it propagates inside the medium on the way out , namely it also acquires a component with @xmath2 projection @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . this component gives rise to a satellite of the cbs peak in the direction @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "we dub this peak in the reflected light intensity as coherent _ umklapp _ scattering ( cus ) .",
    "we note that the above picture is only illustrative . in reality , in addition to the process shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "a variety of diffraction processes contribute to the formation of the cus peaks .",
    "in general , the total number of the cus peaks is determined by the number of reciprocal lattice vectors for which @xmath8 .",
    "it follows from the above qualitative picture that the magnitude of the cus peak is governed by the ratio of the disorder - induced mean free path , @xmath9 ( the elementary step of light diffusion ) and the characteristic length , @xmath10 , of formation of the diffraction component .",
    "this formation occurs most efficiently for the incidence angles @xmath11 , corresponding to the bragg condition @xmath12 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath13 . in this case",
    "@xmath10 coincides with the bragg decay length , @xmath14 , which is the decay length of evanescent wave with frequency in the middle of the photonic stop band .",
    "away from bragg resonance , the length @xmath10 increases resulting in suppression of the cus peak .",
    "we note that the limiting case @xmath15 and @xmath11 was considered in ref .. in this case the cbs and cus peaks are simply the mirror images of each other . in the case of photonic crystal with incomplete gap",
    ", @xmath14 is large ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the question of interest is then : how do the magnitude and shape of the cus peak depend on @xmath17 and on the deviation of the incident beam from the bragg angle .",
    "this question is studied in the present paper .",
    "we generalize the approach of refs .   and   to the case of",
    "periodically modulated dielectric medium and derive analytical expressions for the cbs and cus peaks .",
    "we trace the evolution of the amplitude and width of the cus peak with changing the parameter @xmath17 and the incidence angle , @xmath18 .",
    "we found that the most pronounced variation occurs within the domain @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the conventional derivation of the cbs and introduce the modifications necessary to take into account the bragg reflection in periodic structure . in sec .",
    "iii we derive analytical expressions for the cus and cbs albedo from disordered photonic crystal and analyze limiting cases . in concluding remarks , sec .",
    "iv , we outline generalization of our theory to the case of arbitrary direction of the modulation wave vector .",

    "<S> a theoretical study of the coherent light scattering from disordered photonic crystal is presented . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the conventional enhancement of the reflected light intensity into the backscattering direction , the so called coherent backscattering ( cbs ) , the periodic modulation of the dielectric function in photonic crystals gives rise to a qualitatively new effect : enhancement of the reflected light intensity in directions different from the backscattering direction . </S>",
    "<S> these additional coherent scattering processes , dubbed here _ umklapp scattering _ ( cus ) , result in peaks , which are most pronounced when the incident light beam enters the sample at an angle close to the the bragg angle . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the dielectric function modulation is weak , we study the shape of the cus peaks for different relative lengths of the modulation - induced bragg attenuation compared to disorder - induced mean free path . we show that when the bragg length increases , then the cbs peak assumes its conventional shape , whereas the cus peak rapidly diminishes in amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the suppression of the cus peak upon the departure of the incident beam from bragg resonance : we found that the diminishing of the cus intensity is accompanied by substantial broadening . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the peak becomes asymmetric .    </S>",
