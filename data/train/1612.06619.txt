    "after the end of the lhc run i and the start of the lhc run ii , the direct searches for supersymmetric particles remained unsuccessful , thus increasing the exclusion bounds for the supersymmetric mass scale towards the tev range  @xcite . for the time being , it seems that if supersymmetry is realised in high energy physics the most likely scenario is the one where all susy particles are much heavier than the sm ones .",
    "for such a mass hierarchy ( also called the `` decoupling limit ''  @xcite ) , it was shown  @xcite that the effects of the susy particles on many physical observables in the gauge and higgs sectors scales like @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , for very heavy susy scales , deviations from the sm predictions for these observables will be very challenging to detect .",
    "in such a case , additional efforts both in theory and experiment are required to identify physical observables for which the power suppressed behaviour does not occur , or the decoupling limit is delayed by parametric enhancements like in the presence of large @xmath3 values  @xcite .",
    "prominent examples for this class of observables are the mass of the lightest higgs boson and its self coupling in susy theories that receive radiative corrections increasing with the susy mass scale and mixing parameters .    in this paper",
    "we study the behaviour of the running top quark mass and yukawa coupling in the decoupling limit of the mssm .",
    "although , the running parameters are not themselves observables , they can be related in perturbation theory with more physical parameters like for example effective charges in the mom scheme  @xcite or short - distance masses in msr  @xcite . under the decoupling limit",
    "we understand that all the superpartners , including the additional higgs particles @xmath4 , are much heavier than the sm particles .",
    "we assume that the relation @xmath5 holds .",
    "the case for an intermediate higgs sector ( @xmath6 ) , _",
    "i.e _ at intermediate energies the 2hdm is at work , was studied in detail in the literature  @xcite . here",
    ", we consider the case for which the lightest higgs boson behaves sm like and no additional particles have masses at intermediate energy scales . + as will be shown in the next sections , the non - decoupling effects for the running quark masses and yukawa couplings increase logarithmically with the susy mass scale and have a polynomial dependence with maximal degree three on the mixing parameters in the squark sectors . from a phenomenological point of view , the non - decoupling effects are usually few times larger than the current accuracy on the bottom and top quark mass determinations  @xcite . for yukawa couplings the effects are in the range of precision expected for a 100  tev collider  @xcite . in order to keep the theoretical uncertainties well below the experimental accuracy , we consider here the two - loop radiative corrections of order",
    "@xmath7 induced by the strong and the top - yukawa couplings , and neglect the bottom - yukawa coupling except for scenarios with large @xmath3 values . here",
    ", we concentrate on the theoretical aspects and give some details of the calculation .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the next section we describe briefly the computational framework and introduce our notation . in section 3",
    "we provide analytical results for the decoupling coefficients and discuss their phenomenological implications in section 4 .",
    "our findings are summarized in section 5 .",
    "in the following , we assume that all the sm particles are much lighter than any super partner . in this case , the physical phenomena at low energies can be described with an effective theory , called the smeft ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , containing six quark flavours and the light higgs . at leading order in the heavy masses",
    ", the effective lagrangian @xmath8 can be written as a linear combination of operators constructed from the light degrees of freedom .",
    "we adopt here a `` top - down '' approach , in the sense that the wilson coefficients of the operators will be computed in the full theory , _",
    "i.e _ mssm for our specific calculation . for",

    "the latter is considered explicitely in @xmath12 , that collects all interactions with just one higgs field .",
    "the ellipsis stand for the remaining higher - dimensional operators that we do not study here .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath13 , parameterize the effects of the heavy particles and the superscript @xmath14 labels bare quantities .",
    "the three operators relevant in our computation are defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the gluon field strength tensor and the covariant derivative for quark fields , and the primes label the quantities in the effective theory .",
    "the operator @xmath18 vanishes by the fermionic equation of motion and it will not contribute to physical observables .",
    "so , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq::eft ] ) might be omitted , once the coefficients @xmath19 are determined . for an easier comparison with results already available in the literature",
    ", we stick to the normalization of the operators as stated above .",

    "@xcite , via the redefinitions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the scale of new physics . for intermediate scales",
    "@xmath24 the effects of new physics are embedded in the coefficients of the operators of dimension @xmath25 , with @xmath26 . in the decoupling limit ( @xmath27 ) ( that we assume here ) @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the higher - dimensional operators decouple . in the next section",
    "we will verify through an explicit calculation that these relations hold at one and two loops in the top sector .",
    "furthermore , one has to perform a redefinition of the parameters and fields present in the eft . in mass independent renormalization schemes",
    "the appelquist - carrazone decoupling theorem  @xcite does not hold and the green functions usually depend on the heavy masses and mixing parameters present in the full theory . in order to avoid potentially large logarithms and power corrections",
    "one has to decouple the heavy particles from the theory  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "one obtains different lagrangian parameters in the various energy regimes .",
    "they are connected by the so - called decoupling or matching relations .",
    "the relations between the quantities defined in the full ( mssm ) and effective theories ( smeft ) that are of interest for our study , are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the strong coupling , @xmath32 is the yukawa coupling , with @xmath33 for the present calculation , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath3 defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .",
    "the coefficients @xmath36 are the bare decoupling coefficients .",
    "they may be computed from the transverse part of the gluon polarization function , the vector , axial - vector and scalar part of the quark self - energy , and the higgs self - energy via  @xcite @xmath37 the pseudo - scalar part of the quark self - energy vanishes both in the sm and the mssm through two loops , that renders the equation for @xmath38 in the reduced form given above .",
    "decoupling coefficients are renormalized in a similar manner with the associated parameters and fields  @xcite .",
    "the superscript @xmath39 indicates that at least one heavy particle is present in the diagrams .",
    "sample feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",

    "we neglect electroweak effects ( also known as the gaugeless limit ) .",
    "the last approximation is motivated by the small size of the one - loop electroweak effects on the considered parameters .",
    "nevertheless , for the one - loop calculation we assume the following mass hierarchy in the ew sector @xmath40 in this limit , the mass matrices for charginos and neutralinos become diagonal and there is no mixing between higgsinos and electroweakinos .",
    "thus , at the two - loop order we will practically take into account only diagrams with higgsinos .    in our setup , the feynman diagrams are generated with the program qgraf  @xcite , and further processed with q2e and exp  @xcite . in the approximation we worked out , the propagator and vertex topologies can be reduced to two - loop tadpoles  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of various vacuum integrals to the master integral was performed by a self - written form  @xcite routine .",
    "for the regularization of the smeft we used dimensional regularization ( dreg ) and for the underlying supersymmetric theory the dimensional reduction ( dred ) . technically , we implemented dred with the help of @xmath41-scalars for the @xmath42 and assigned them heavy masses  @xcite . with this , we perform the change of regularization scheme within the decoupling procedure . as a consistency check",
    ", we verified through two loops that the decoupling coefficients do not depend on the unphysical mass parameters associated with the @xmath41-scalars , as expected . in order",
    "to get rid of the unphysical @xmath41-scalar masses , finite shifts in the squark masses have to be introduced  @xcite .    for the renormalization of the uv divergences , we employed the minimal subtraction scheme @xmath43 for the coupling constants , quark masses , squark masses and mixing angles .",
    "the renormalization constants for the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be derived from the definition of the mixing angles .",
    "let us mention that the contributions proportional to the top- and bottom - quark masses in the renormalization constants for the squark masses and mixing angles do not contribute to the decoupling coefficients . however , such terms have to be kept in the derivation of the renormalization constants for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "explicit one - loop formulae for the renormalization constants for the quark and squark masses and mixing angle can be found in ref .",
    "for the limit we are interested in here , one has to set the goldstone boson masses to zero and apply eqs .",
