    "the present work is a sequel to a work by bettinelli @xcite , whose aim is to investigate the topology of scaling limits for random maps of arbitrary genus .",
    "a map is a cellular embedding of a finite graph ( possibly with multiple edges and loops ) into a compact connected orientable surface without boundary , considered up to orientation - preserving homeomorphisms . by _",
    ", we mean that the faces of the map  the connected components of the complement of edges  are all homeomorphic to disks .",
    "the genus of the map is defined as the genus of the surface into which it is embedded . for technical reasons",
    ", it will be convenient to deal with rooted maps , meaning that one of the half - edges  or oriented edges  is distinguished .",
    "we will particularly focus on bipartite quadrangulations : a map is a quadrangulation if all its faces have degree @xmath5 ; it is bipartite if each vertex can be colored in black or white , in such a way that no edge links two vertices that have the same color .",
    "although in genus @xmath6 , all quadrangulations are bipartite , this is no longer true in positive genus @xmath7 .    a natural way to generate a large random bipartite quadrangulation of genus",
    "@xmath0 is to choose it uniformly at random from the set @xmath8 of all rooted bipartite quadrangulations of genus @xmath0 with @xmath3 faces , and then consider the limit as @xmath3 goes to infinity .",
    "a natural setting for this problem is to consider quadrangulations as metric spaces endowed with their graph metric , properly rescaled by the factor @xmath4 @xcite and to study their limit in the gromov ",
    "hausdorff topology  @xcite . from this point of view , the planar case @xmath6 has largely been studied during the last decade .",
    "le gall  @xcite showed the convergence of these metric spaces along some subsequence .",
    "it is believed that the convergence holds without the `` along some subsequence '' part in the last sentence , and le gall gave a conjecture for a limiting space to this sequence  @xcite .",
    "although the whole convergence is yet to be proved , some information is available on the accumulation points of this sequence .",
    "le gall and paulin  @xcite proved that every possible limiting metric space is almost surely homeomorphic to the two - dimensional sphere .",
    "miermont  @xcite later gave a variant proof of this fact .",
    "we showed in  @xcite that the convergence along some subsequence still holds in any fixed positive genus @xmath0 . in this work , we show that the topology of every possible limiting space is that of the genus @xmath0-torus @xmath9 .",
    "we will work in fixed genus @xmath0 . on the whole",
    ", we will not let it figure in the notation , in order to lighten them .",
    "as the case @xmath6 has already been studied , we suppose @xmath7 .",
    "recall that the gromov ",
    "hausdorff distance between two compact metric spaces @xmath10 and @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 where the infimum is taken over all isometric embeddings @xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xmath15 and @xmath16 into the same metric space @xmath17 , and @xmath18 stands for the usual hausdorff distance between compact subsets of @xmath19 .",
    "this defines a metric on the set @xmath20 of isometry classes of compact metric spaces @xcite , theorem  7.3.30 , making it a polish space .    for any map @xmath21 , we call @xmath22 its set of vertices",
    ". there exists on @xmath22 a natural graph metric @xmath23 : for any vertices  @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the distance @xmath26 is defined as the number of edges of any shortest path linking  @xmath24 to  @xmath27 .",
    "the main result of  @xcite is the following .",
    "[ cvq ] let @xmath2 be uniformly distributed over the set @xmath8 of all bipartite quadrangulations of genus @xmath0 with @xmath3 faces .",
    "then , from any increasing sequence of integers , we may extract a subsequence @xmath28 such that there exists a metric space @xmath29 satisfying @xmath30 in the sense of the gromov ",
    "hausdorff topology , where @xmath31    moreover , the hausdorff dimension of the limit space @xmath29 is almost surely equal to @xmath5 , regardless of the choice of the sequence of integers .",
    "remark that the constant @xmath32 is not necessary in this statement ( simply change @xmath33 into @xmath34 ) .",
    "we kept it for the sake of consistency with  @xcite , and because of our definition of @xmath33 later in the paper , although it is irrelevant for the moment .",
    "note also that , a priori , the metric space @xmath35 depends on the subsequence @xmath28 .",
    "similarly to the planar case , we believe that the extraction in proposition  [ cvq ] is not necessary , and we conjecture the space @xmath36 for the limit , where @xmath37 was defined at the end of section 6.3 in @xcite .",
    "we also believe that the space @xmath38 is somewhat universal , in the sense that we conjecture it as the scaling limit of more general classes of random maps .",
    "more precisely , we think that proposition  [ cvq ] still holds while replacing the class of quadrangulations with some other `` reasonable '' class of maps , as well as the constant @xmath32 , which is inherent to the class of quadrangulations , with the appropriate constant . in particular , our approach can be generalized to the case of @xmath39-angulations , @xmath40 , by following the same lines as le gall in  @xcite .",
    "we may now state our main result , which identifies the topology of @xmath41 , regardless of the subsequence @xmath28 .",
    "[ cvq2 ] the metric space @xmath42 is a.s .",
    "homeomorphic to the @xmath0-torus  @xmath9 .",
    "in the general picture , we rely on the same techniques as in the planar case .",
    "the starting point is to use a bijection due to chapuy , marcus and schaeffer  @xcite between bipartite quadrangulations of genus @xmath0 with @xmath3 faces and so - called well - labeled @xmath0-trees with @xmath3 edges .",
    "the study of the scaling limit as @xmath43 of uniform random well - labeled @xmath0-trees with @xmath3 edges was the major purpose of  @xcite .",
    "this study leads to the construction of a continuum random @xmath0-tree , which generalizes aldous s crt @xcite .",
    "the first step of our proof is to carry out the analysis of le gall  @xcite in the nonplanar case and see the space @xmath44 as a quotient of this continuum random @xmath0-tree via an equivalence relation defined in terms of brownian labels on it .",
    "we then adapt miermont s approach @xcite , and use the notion of 1-regularity introduced by whyburn  @xcite and studied by whyburn and begle @xcite in order to see that the genus remains the same in the limit .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "finally , we deduce the technical estimates we need from the planar case thanks to a bijection due to chapuy  @xcite between well - labeled @xmath0-trees and well - labeled plane trees with @xmath0 distinguished triples of vertices .",
    "we will use the background provided in  @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall it in section  [ secprel ] . in section  [ secrgt ] , we define real @xmath0-trees and explain how we may see @xmath35 as a quotient of such objects .",
    "theorem  [ ip ] in section  [ secip ] gives a criteria telling which points are identified in this quotient , and section  [ secsurf ] is dedicated to the proof of theorem [ cvq2 ] .",
    "finally , we expose in section  [ secprle ] chapuy s bijection , and use it to prove four technical lemmas stated during section  [ secip ] .",
    "in this section , we recall the notation , settings and results from @xcite that we will need for this work .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for more details .",
    "we use the following formalism for maps . for any map",
    "@xmath21 , we denote by @xmath22 and @xmath45 , respectively , its sets of vertices and edges .",
