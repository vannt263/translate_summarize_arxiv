    "a tumor growing beyond a critical size can only do so by remodeling its surrounding blood vessel network that supply nutrients and oxygen and removes waste products .",
    "this process is initiated by tumor cells secreting various growth factors that induce angiogenesis , the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones @xcite .",
    "the neo - vascularization primarily occurs in the periphery of the tumor which gives rise to a peripheral region with substantially increased micro - vascular density ( mvd )  @xcite . inside the tumor",
    "the mvd is usually drastically decreased , often leading to a necrotic core .",
    "previous studies by gdde _",
    "_  @xcite focused on the angiogenesis showed that blood shear stress - dependent rather than pressure - dependent growth leads to a homogeneous distribution of capillaries .",
    "however , the influence of a growing tumor on the angiogenic vasculature was missing .",
    "several other studies have focused on the angiogenesis in presence of a static tumor  @xcite or growth of a tumor within fixed vasculature  @xcite .",
    "more recently biologically motivated hybrid cellular automaton models have been introduced by bartha _",
    "et al _ , lee _ et al _ and welter _ et al _",
    "@xcite to study this remodeling process of the tumor vasculature via cooption , vessel growth and regression . here",
    "the vasculature is modeled by a network of pipes carrying a flow that is a source for a oxygen or nutrient concentration field , whereas the tumor is modeled as a growth - and - death process that involves discrete cells proliferating or dying in dependence of the local level of this concentration field .",
    "simultaneously the tumor cells are the sources for a growth factor concentration field that triggers the formation of new links in the vessel network at the tumor periphery and the dilation of pipes in the tumor s interior .",
    "vessels can also regress inside the tumor due to increased solid stress or high acidity .",
    "their models reproduce many known features of experimentally analyzed tumor vasculature like the compartmentalization into a highly vascularized perimeter , a well perfused tumor periphery and necrotic core with only a few thick vessels threading it @xcite .",
    "in addition to the inhomogeneous mvd , tumor vasculatures are abnormal in various ways , e.g. , leaky , tortuous and dilated , have excessive branching and undergo constant regression and remodeling  @xcite . in particular it turned out that the emerging vasculature has fractal properties reminiscent of percolation clusters  @xcite . in @xcite it was argued that these specific geometric properties were the consequences of a flow correlated percolation process .    in order to disentangle the basic mechanism responsible for this process from the various biological details of the model described in @xcite we formulate here a drastically simplified version of it , comprising , as we propose , the essential features leading to the global characteristics of the vessel network morphology .",
    "in essence we retain only the underlying dynamical pipe network capable of carrying a flow plus a circular tumor that increases its radius linearly in time .",
    "this circular region is further subdivided into a peripheral annulus where new pipes are inserted into the vessel network , and an inner annulus , where pipes are dilated and/or removed from the network .",
    "the latter process turn out to produce the flow correlated percolation process observed in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  [ def_model ] the model is defined , which represents a stochastic process that is studied with monte carlo simulation .",
    "the results of these simulations are presented and analyzed in the third section . in particular",
    "we study two variants of the model and demonstrate that only shear force correlated vessel collapse inside the tumor yields percolating morphologies of the tumor vasculature that is in good agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "further , a fractal analysis of the resulting tumor vasculature is performed to quantify the network architecture .",
    "section  [ summary ] summarizes our findings .",
    "the model introduced in @xcite and refined in @xcite consists of a network of pipes representing the vasculature and a cellular automaton , reminiscent of the eden model , representing the tumor .",
    "both parts interact via a oxygen and/or nutrient concentration field , whose sources are perfused blood vessels , and a growth factor concentration field , whose sources are tumor cells .",
    "both concentration fields are governed by diffusion equations .",
    "blood flow through the blood vessels is modeled as ideal pipe flow with flow conservation in each node ( junction ) of the network .",
    "new vessels are inserted into the network under certain conditions , among which local growth factor concentration is the most important one .",
    "vessels can vanish ( regress ) once they are overgrown by tumor cells .",
    "the latter proliferate when the oxygen / nutrient concentration is sufficiently large and die when it is too low .",
    "this model displays , over a wide range of the parameters , a growing tumor whose radius increases linearly with time .",
    "it displays a compartmentalization into a highly vascularized perimeter , a periphery region with increased vessel density and a necrotic core , i.e.  a center in which most of the tumor cells are dead and which is threaded only by a few thick vessels surrounded by cuffs of tumor cells .",

    "mimics the essence of prior models  @xcite by compartmentalizing the entire tumor into an annulus at the tumor periphery where new vessels can emerge and an inner annulus , where vessels can vanish with specialized criteria as discussed below .",
    "also the processes by which new vessels are inserted is simplified to the extent of stochastic vessel growth .",
    "the model is defined as follows :    the model variables and model parameters are summarized in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] , respectively . the system configuration ( tumor and network ) is defined on a 2-dimensional graph @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the set of nodes and @xmath17 refers to the set of edges .",

    "blood vessel segments are represented by the edges .",
    "each vessel is compared with a cylindrical rod of uniform circular cross - section of radius @xmath29 .",
    "the blood flow through the vessel is approximated by the laminar steady poiseulles flow of a homogeneous , incompressible fluid ( newtonian fluid ) .",
    "hence the amount of fluid @xmath6 that can pass through the vessel of length @xmath1 per unit time is given by , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pressure difference between the two ends of the vessel and @xmath32 is the coefficient of dynamic fluid viscosity .",
    "since @xmath32 is assumed to be a constant , we renormalize the flow by the factor @xmath33 .",

    "we assume , the top - left corner ( @xmath35 ) of the lattice at pressure @xmath36 ( = 1 ) is connected to the source artery , and the bottom - right corner ( @xmath37 ) at pressure 0 is connected to the sink vein . the pressure at any point on the boundary ( e.g. , top and bottom boundaries , @xmath38 for @xmath39 ; and left and right boundaries , @xmath40 for @xmath41 is given by : @xmath42 $ ] .",

    "although , the proliferation of tc must be supported by availability of adequate oxygen in the neighborhood of the tumor surface @xcite , in our simplified model , such restrictions are not imposed .",
    "we assume that there is always sufficient oxygen available in the neighborhood and along the tumor perimeter region to assist the proliferation process .",
    "tumor continues to evolve until the finite size of the simulating system restrict its growth at @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the width of angiogenesis outside the tumor surface , as illustrated below .",
    "each tumor cell releases some growth factor ( gf ) which activates the proliferation of new blood vessels  @xcite .",
    "gf concentration is high inside the tumor and decays to a negligible concentration beyond a distance @xmath59 .",
    "naturally , @xmath58 is the range of angiogenesis . since",
    ", the space inside the tumor is densely occupied by tumor cells , the vessel proliferation in that region is highly suppressed and therefore we consider the angiogenesis to occur mainly within the arbitrarily chosen annular ring of thickness @xmath60 , outside the tumor surface .",

    ", we do not consider dynamic variations in angiogenesis during the course of tumor evolution , i.e. both @xmath64 and @xmath68 are constant in time .",
    "this approximation is reasonable , but might not be the case in real systems and should be addressed in our future models .      inside the tumor angiogenic sprouting is minimized , however , endothelial cell proliferation still occurs along the vessel perimeter , leading to their enhanced circumferential growth .",
    "experiments proposed that high growth factor and hypoxia induced activation of eph / ephrin pathways  @xcite might be responsible for vessel thickening inside tumor core .",
    "thus in the present model , all vessels inside the tumor are updated sequentially by increasing their radius @xmath29 at each time step by @xmath71 with a probability @xmath72 as long as @xmath29 does not saturates to a maximum value @xmath73 : @xmath74 , if @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a random number and @xmath77 for positive @xmath78 and 0 elsewhere .",
    "tumor vessels are tortuous and leaky .",
    "vessel membranes become unstable due the lack of pericytes , resulting in frequent vessel collapse and regression @xcite",
    ". a reduced flow may not be sufficient to prevent the vessel against the stress exerted by the neighboring tumor cells and can become the key factor for their collapse  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the vessel shear force and identify weakly perfusing vessels inside the tumor : @xmath79 . vessels with normalized shear forces @xmath80 falling below the critical value @xmath81 , are removed from the rest of the vasculature with probability @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "instead of removing the vessels by shear force criterion , if we remove them with normalized flow @xmath82(not shown ) , or normalized pressure ( see appendix  [ appc ] ) a completely different vasculature is observed .",
    "other than the flow , pressure and shear force correlated vessel collapse we have also employed another criterion for vessel collapse , in which the vessels inside the tumor , below a certain age ( @xmath2=critical lifetime ) , are removed probabilistically .",
    "this mechanism suggests that , if vessels are able to survive until a critical life time @xmath2 , they live for ever .    both , vessel - dilation and vessel - collapse together give rise to long nonuniform vessels as shown in fig .",

    "first we consider the growth of a circular tumor in the back - bone of a capillary network arranged in a 2@xmath86 square lattice , as described earlier .",
    "the entire lattice is assumed to be connected to outer vessels ( vein and arteries ) along one of the two diagonal directions . during the tumor evolution , vessels inside the tumor collapse with a certain probability , resulting in many non - circulating dangling vessels . at each time step these non - circulating ( non - biconnected ) vessels",
    "are completely removed from the rest of the lattice .",
    "vessels do not collapse further if they survive up to a critical lifetime @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to visualize that in the beginning , although all intra - tumoral vessels are in critical state , with the maturation ( aging ) of the tumor , critical zone moves away from the tumor center and stay limited within the annulus of thickness @xmath87 ( for @xmath88 ) under the tumor surface . when the tumor diameter becomes comparable to the linear size @xmath0 of the lattice , we examine if a continuous path exists inside the tumor along any of the two diagonal directions of the lattice .",

    "[ pinf_snpshot_without_angio ] suggest that random vessel collapse with and without angiogenesis yields two distinct phases of the tumor vasculature : one in which the tumor center is completely vascularized and one in which it is completely void , separated by a percolation transition at a critical collapse probability .",

    "the spatio - temporal characteristic curves for mvd , blood flow , shear force , pressure gradient and vessel radius as predicted in  @xcite , are reproducible by our simplistic approach ( see appendix b ) .",
    "our model predicts that inhomogeneity in the network is caused by the interplay between the excessive vascularization in the tumor periphery and vessel collapse in the interior .",
    "we have implemented two different mechanisms for the probabilistic rupture of vessels _ viz _ , random collapse and shear stress correlated collapse .",
    "the latter is motivated by the study on normal vessels which undergo a structural reduction of internal vessel diameter due to a decreased wall shear stress ( brought about by changes of blood flow )  @xcite . when the vessels are removed randomly , the interior of the tumor is either containing a dense vasculature or completely empty .",
    "this phenomenon is well understood from the basic law of percolation theory  @xcite and suggest the existence of a spanning vasculature for a particular collapse probability @xmath90 , known as percolation threshold . under the random vessel collapse criterion ,",
    "a percolating phase requires a fine tuning of @xmath4 which depends strongly on the model parameters .",
    "next we considered a probabilistic vessel collapse , with shear force falling below a critical value inside the tumor , while the vessel diameter is kept constant .",
    "after the initial removal of weakly perfusing vessels , which are usually perpendicular to the flow direction , long vessels remain parallel to the principal flow direction .",
    "these vessels may further suffer from the insufficient shear force due to their increased length .",
    "however , an increased pressure drop across the vessel or an enlargement in vessel diameter can amplify the amount of blood flow and consequently the shear force .",
    "vessels , for which the shear compensation is not made by the increased flow or pressure drop , eventually collapse .",
    "thus , in the long run , a few empty regions appearing along the principal flow direction , with increased mvd regions visible along the transverse flow direction , producing a physically unrealistic tumor vasculature , unlike as reported in  @xcite .",
    "our model predicts a percolating morphology of tumor vasculature which is maintained by the correlation between the probabilistic vessel collapse and the local shear stress exerted by the blood flowing through it .",
    "however , they key ingredient to produce a realistic vasculature is still missing .",
    "therefore , we included the intratumoral vessel dilation .",
    "high growth factor and hypoxia induced activation of eph / ephrin pathways has been reported to reduce the angiogenic branching and enhance the vascular circumferential growth inside the tumor  @xcite .",
    "vessel dilation which occurs inside the tumor  @xcite and taken into account in prior models  @xcite , plays crucial role in determining the vasculature morphology . implementing probabilistic vessels dilation inside the tumor together with shear stress correlated vessel collapse ,",
    "a physically realistic vasculature is established  @xcite , which is robust under a large parameter variations . the inherent mechanism for the stability of the remaining vessels after a collapse event had occurred , caused by the diversion of the blood flow and consequential increase in shear stresses , bringing them above the collapse threshold .",
    "another potential candidate for vessel dilution inside the tumor could naturally be the critical blood pressure ( @xmath121 ) , above which vessels are torn apart .",
    "we have tested this scenario by varying the critical threshold of of @xmath121 from 0.001 to 0.5 .",
    "the snapshots , displayed in appendix  [ appc](fig .  [ press_vessel_collapse ] ) , shows that the resulting tumor vasculature , below moderate @xmath121 , is percolating , but its morphology appears physically unrealistic .    in this work ,",
    "we have not considered dynamic variations in angiogenesis during the course of tumor evolution , i.e. both @xmath64 and @xmath68 remained constant in time .",
    "this approximation is reasonable , but might not be the case in real systems and should be addressed in our future models .",
    "our model also predicts a fractal geometry of the tumor vasculature . the fractal dimension @xmath122 that we have estimated , is compared with @xmath123  @xcite obtained by two - dimensional images analysis of vessel networks in human carcinoma .",
    "previous theoretical estimates of @xmath107 in 2@xmath86  @xcite and in 3@xmath86  @xcite , however differ slightly from our results .",
    "it has been argued that extracellular matrix inhomogeneity in tumors might be responsible for the invasion percolation  @xcite and fractal architecture of tumor vasculature .",
    "our analysis and those performed earlier @xcite , having no such extracellular matrix dependency , suggests that the flow correlated percolation could also be the possible origin of the fractal tumor vasculature . to confirm this ,",
    "extensive simulations should be carried out with bigger systems .",
    "our present model does not assume any correlation between length , radius and thickness of the vessel .",
    "such correlation might be relevant in a real context and therefore should be addressed in our future studies .",
    "we wish to thank h. rieger and k. bartha for useful discussions .",
    "the entire dynamical process is quantified by measuring the following quantities at each time step : average mvd is measured as a function of radial distance @xmath124 from the center of the tumor by estimating the total length of endothelial cells @xmath1 spanning through a unit cell ( a unit box of edge length @xmath9 , as defined earlier ) within the annular ring of radius @xmath124 and thickness @xmath125 .",
    "radial distribution of flow and shear force are also calculated in the similar way and pressure is calculated at each point @xmath126 over the entire lattice .",
    "the change in normalized mvd ( i.e. , with respect to mvd@xmath127 ) is plotted as a function of radial distance @xmath124 and time @xmath128 in fig .",
    "[ main_plot_uniform_vessel ] ( a ) .",
    "a sharp maximum is observed at a distance @xmath129 which is approximately equal to the tumor radius @xmath130 . due to the fixed angiogenic probabilities",
    "@xmath64 , @xmath68 and no vessel regression out side the tumor periphery , maximum mvd remains constant in time . since the tumor is assumed to grow linearly in time , @xmath129 is also found to be a linear function of @xmath128 .",
    "far out side the tumor ( @xmath131 ) , the normalized mvd remains constant , due to the absence of angiogenesis .",
    "for radii @xmath132 ( inside the tumor ) , the mvd decreases very quickly to the normal tissue mvd@xmath127 and then slowly to values slightly lower than mvd@xmath127 towards the center of the tumor .    the normalized blood flow @xmath133 is presented in fig .  [ main_plot_uniform_vessel ] ( b ) .",
    "the profile shows a small dip around @xmath134 , and then increases sharply to a value similar to the normal tissues and remains almost constant inside the tumor .",
    "the sharp fall results from the effect of high mvd around the periphery of the tumor which divides the flow into many components . on the contrary ,",
    "a constant normalized flow inside the tumor is caused by the uniformity of vessel radius .",
    "similar behavior , like the blood flow , has also been displayed by the normalized shear force @xmath135 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ main_plot_uniform_vessel ] ( c ) .",
    "later we will see , in appendix  [ appb ] , that a variable radius changes the entire scenario .",
    "morphological changes in the vasculature modifies the pressure field in the network .",
    "e.g. , pressure field at time @xmath136 with respect to the one at @xmath85 , as reported in fig .",
    "[ main_plot_uniform_vessel ] ( d ) , shows no difference away from the tumor region , however , it decreases near the periphery of the tumor .",
    "this characteristic feature arises as the total blood flow enters the tumor through the highly vascularized peritumoral region , resulting in a decreased pressure gradient . to preserve the flow conservation , the pressure gradient increases inside the tumor till the exit end .",
    "if the critical shear force is tuned to a higher value ( @xmath137 ) , the pressure difference flips it s pattern ( not shown ) due the lack of mvd on both sides of the tumor along the flow direction .",
    "in fig .  [ main_plot_nonuniform_vessel](a ) we quantify micro vascular density .",
    "normalized mvd shows a sharp maxima at a distance @xmath129 from the center of the tumor , which is approximately equal to the tumor radius @xmath54 , and then decays rapidly towards the center of the tumor .",
    "this scenario is in accordance with the results reported in  @xcite , but contradicts slow decay of mvd reported in  @xcite .",
    "the normalized blood flow , presented in fig .  [ main_plot_nonuniform_vessel](b ) , increases very rapidly towards the center of the tumor , supports prior findings  @xcite . since the vessel radius @xmath29 increases linearly towards the tumor center , the flow increases as the fourth power ( as per eq .",
    "[ eq_flow ] ) of the radius .",
    "large increase in the flow , does not allow us to see the minor fluctuations ( e.g. , the dip at @xmath138 in the previous case  [ main_plot_uniform_vessel](b ) ) in the current profile .",
    "[ main_plot_nonuniform_vessel](c ) shows the normalized shear force as a function of @xmath124 and @xmath128 . we observe a sharp minima along the periphery of the tumor , where mvd displays a maxima .",
    "according to eq .",
    "[ eq_shear ] , shear force is proportional to vessel - radius @xmath29 and the pressure gradient across it . since @xmath50 remains constant outside the tumor , new vessel originated due to angiogenesis decrease the pressure gradient which in turn drops the shear force in the region of interest .",
    "however , inside the tumor increase of @xmath29 and pressure gradient causes an increase in the shear force .",
    "our result is in agreement with  @xcite , but disagrees with the sharp fall observed near the center of the tumor , reported in  @xcite .    the blood pressure difference at a particular instant @xmath136 normalized by the maximum pressure at @xmath139 , is shown in fig .  [ main_plot_nonuniform_vessel ] ( d ) .",
    "the characteristic behavior of @xmath140 resembles to the previous case with uniform vessel radius and the results obtained in  @xcite .",
    "far from the tumor periphery , the pressure difference is zero , which decreases further as the blood flow entering the tumor through the highly vascularized peritumoral region . to preserve the flow conservation , the pressure gradient increases inside the tumor along the flow direction .",
    "the average vessel radius is constant outside the tumor .",
    "it increases almost linearly with time , once we move from the periphery towards the tumor center , as shown in the fig .",
    "[ main_plot_nonuniform_vessel ] ( e ) . in the vicinity near the center of the tumor ,",
    "linear increase in the vessel radius is slowed down and tend to saturate toward the maximum value , although the maximum vessel radius is never reached by the system .",
    "results reported in  @xcite also shows similar profile .",
    "like shear force , blood pressure could also be a potential candidate for the flow - correlated percolation . here",

    "similar percolation ceases to occur for higher values of @xmath143 .",
    "moreover , under the pressure correlated vessel collapse , the resulting tumor vasculaure appears entirely different from that we have seen in the main section of this paper .",
    "we have simulated our model by translating angiogenic regime inside and outside the tumor periphery .",
    "earlier , in this paper , we have considered angiogenesis occurring only outside the tumor periphery .",
