    "chiral gauge theories , in which at least part of the matter field content is in complex representations of the gauge group , play an important role in efforts to extend the standard model .",
    "these include grand unified theories , dynamical breaking of symmetries , and theories of quark and lepton substructure .",
    "an important distinction from vector - like theories such as qcd is that since at least some of the chiral symmetries are gauged , mass terms that would explicitly break these chiral symmetries are forbidden in the lagrangian .",
    "another key feature is that the fermion content is subject to a constraint not present in vectorial gauge theories , the cancellation of gauge and gravitational anomalies .",
    "chiral theories received much attention in the 1980 s  @xcite , focusing on their strong coupling behavior in the infrared .",
    "one possibility is confinement with the gauge symmetry as well as global symmetries unbroken , realized by the formation of gauge singlet , massless composite fermions .",
    "another is confinement with intact gauge symmetry but with some of the global symmetries broken spontaneously , leading to the formation of gauge - singlet goldstone bosons .",
    "it is also possible for these theories to exist in the higgs phase , dynamically breaking their own gauge symmetries  @xcite .",
    "depending on particle content , they might even remain weakly coupled",
    ". this will happen if the theory has an interacting but weak infrared fixed point .",
    "the symmetries will then remain unbroken , and the infrared and underlying degrees of freedom will be the same .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) chiral theories have also received considerable attention over the years , since most of the known examples of dynamical supersymmetry breaking involve these kinds of theories @xcite .",
    "studies of chiral gauge theories have typically made use of the t hooft global anomaly matching conditions  @xcite along with @xmath1 expansion , and not - so - reliable most attractive channel ( mac ) @xcite analysis and instanton computations .",
    "direct approaches using strong coupling lattice methods @xcite are still difficult .",
    "another indirect approach developed recently @xcite takes the form of an inequality limiting the number of massless degrees of freedom in the infrared description of a field theory to be no larger than the number of ultraviolet degrees of freedom .",
    "it was conjectured to apply to all asymptotically free theories whose infrared behavior is also governed by a fixed point , not necessarily free .",
    "the inequality is formulated using finite temperature as a device to probe all energy scales , with the degree - of - freedom count defined using the free energy of the field theory .",
    "the zero - temperature theory of interest is characterized using the quantity @xmath2 , related to the free energy by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the temperature and @xmath5 is the conventionally defined free energy per unit volume .",
    "the limit is well defined if the theory has an infrared fixed point .",
    "for the special case of an infrared - free theory , @xmath2 is simply the number of massless bosons plus @xmath6 times the number of 2-component massless weyl fermions .",
    "the corresponding expression in the large @xmath4 limit is @xmath7 this limit will be well defined if the theory has an ultraviolet fixed point . for an asymptotically free theory @xmath8",
    "counts the underlying , ultraviolet degrees of freedom in a similar way .    in terms of these quantities ,",
    "the conjectured inequality for any asymptotically - free theory is @xmath9 this inequality has not been proven , but in ref .  @xcite it was shown to agree with all known results and then used to derive new results for several strongly coupled , vector - like gauge theories .",
    "it was applied to chiral theories in ref .",
    "the principal focus there was on the possibility of preserving the global symmetries through the formation of massless composite fermions .    in this paper , we examine further the two non - supersymmetric chiral theories of ref .",
    "@xcite , both rich in possible phase structure .",
    "one is the bars - yankielowicz ( by ) @xcite model involving fermions in the two - index symmetric tensor representation , and the other is a generalized georgi - glashow ( ggg ) model involving fermions in the two - index antisymmetric tensor representation . in each case , in addition to fermions in complex representations , a set of @xmath10 anti fundamental - fundamental pairs are included and the allowed phases are considered as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "several possible phases emerge , consistent with global anomaly matching and the above inequality .",
    "graphs for the various @xmath2 s vs @xmath10 are plotted for each model .",
    "they lead us to the suggestion that each of these theories will choose from among the allowed phases the one that minimizes @xmath2 at each value of @xmath10 .",
    "this idea is useful only to distinguish among phases for which the @xmath2 s are computable , those that are infrared free or governed by a weak infrared fixed point .",
    "it may be rephrased in terms of the entropy per unit volume @xmath11 of the system ( the derivative of the pressure per unit volume @xmath12 ) .",
    "provided only that the limit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : firdef ] ) exists , @xmath11 near freeze out will be given by @xmath13 plus higher order terms in the low temperature expansion .",
    "thus the minimum number of degrees of freedom corresponds to the minimum entropy at approach to freeze out , consistent with global anomaly matching .",
    "now of course at any finite t , the preferred phase is chosen from among all the states entering the partition function by minimizing the free energy density , which becomes the energy density at @xmath14 . comparing these quantities for different states when the theory is strongly interacting is , however , generally a strong coupling problem .",
    "the conjecture for these theories is the following . assuming that the candidate phases revealed by anomaly matching _ are _ states entering the partition function , the state with the relatively lower energy density is approached at a lower rate proportional to the lower @xmath2 .",
    "the latter quantity is computable in terms of only the effective low energy theory which is infrared free for the phases being considered here .",
    "we focus almost completely on symmetry breaking patterns corresponding to the formation of bilinear condensates .",
    "we suggest that in general , the phase corresponding to confinement with all symmetries unbroken , where all the global anomalies are matched by massless composite fermions , is not preferred .",
    "instead , the global symmetries associated with fermions in real representations break spontaneously via bilinear condensate formation as in qcd . with respect to the fermions in complex representations , however , the formation of bilinear condensates is suggested to be disfavored relative to confinement and the preservation of the global symmetries via massless composite fermion formation .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the real world case of two - flavor qcd ( a vector - like theory with _ all _ fermions in a real representation ) nature prefers to minimize @xmath2 .",
    "neglecting the small bare quark masses , global anomaly matching admits two possible low energy phases , broken chiral symmetry through the formation of the bilinear @xmath15 condensate , or unbroken chiral symmetry through the formation of confined massless baryons .",
    "both effective low energy theories are infrared free .",
    "the three goldstone bosons of the former ( chosen by nature ) lead to @xmath16 , and the two massless composite dirac fermions of the latter lead to @xmath17 .",
    "bilinear condensate formation is of course not the only possibility in a strongly coupled gauge field theory .",
    "we have so far extended our discussion to include general condensate formation for one simple example , the @xmath18 georgi - glashow model , which has fermions in only complex representations and has only a @xmath19 global symmetry .",
    "this symmetry can be broken via only higher dimensional condensates .",
    "interestingly , this breaking pattern , with confinement and unbroken gauge symmetry , leads to the minimum value of @xmath2 .",
    "this highlights the important general question of the pattern of symmetry breaking in chiral theories when arbitrary condensate formation is considered .",
    "higher dimensional condensates might play an important role , for example , in the dynamical breaking of symmetries in extensions of the standard model @xcite .",

    "the theory is strongly coupled at low energies , so it is expected either to confine or to break some of the symmetries , consistent with global anomaly matching .",

    "this suggests that higher dimensional condensate formation may indeed be preferred in this model",

    "this will therefore also be true of the general-@xmath10 case for @xmath18 .",
    "this even lower count corresponds to complete confinement along with breaking of the chiral symmetry associated with the @xmath10 @xmath93-@xmath94 pairs _ and _ breaking of the remaining global @xmath19 symmetry .",

    "the absence of flat directions is due to the fact that there exists no holomorphic gauge invariant polynomial constructed out of the supersymmetric fields .",
    "this feature guarantees that when comparing phases through their degree - of - freedom count , we know that we are considering a single underlying theory . by contrast , in susy gauge theories with flat directions , non - zero condensates associated with the breaking of global symmetries correspond to different points in moduli space and therefore to different theories .",
    "this model was studied long ago @xcite and various possible phases were seen to be consistent with global anomaly matching .",
    "one preserves supersymmetry along with the global symmetries .",
    "this requires composite massless fermions to saturate the global anomalies .",

    "it is expected @xcite that in a supersymmetric theory without classical flat directions , the spontaneous breaking of global symmetries also signals spontaneous supersymmetry breaking . in these cases , the only massless fields will be the goldstone boson(s ) associated with the broken global symmetries and/or some massless fermions transforming under the unbroken chiral symmetries , together with the goldstone weyl fermion associated with the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking .    in reference",
    "@xcite it was suggested on esthetic grounds that the supersymmetric solution seems less plausible .",
    "additional arguments that supersymmetry is broken are based on investigating correlators in an instanton background @xcite . however a firm solution to this question is not yet available .",
    "since all the above phases are non interacting in the infrared we may reliably compute @xmath2 and note that the phase that minimizes the degree - of - freedom count is the one that breaks supersymmetry and both of the global symmetries .",
    "this phase consists of two @xmath19 goldstone bosons and a single weyl goldstino associated with the breaking of susy .",
    "thus @xmath188 .",
    "susy preserving phases and those that leave one or both of the @xmath189 unbroken lead to more degrees of freedom .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether further dynamical studies confirm that the maximally broken phase is indeed preferred    this phase is similar to the minimal-@xmath2 phase in the nonsupersymmetric @xmath18 model in that both correspond to higher dimensional condensate formation . in the susy case , one can construct two independent order parameters .",
    "the one for @xmath187 is the gluino condensate ( scalar component of the chiral superfield @xmath190 ) while the one for @xmath186 can be taken to be the scalar component of the chiral superfield @xmath191 .",
    "finally we comment on a well known and related chiral model for dynamical supersymmetry breaking : the ( @xmath20 ) model . unlike the models considered so far , this model involves multiple couplings , i.e. two gauge couplings and a yukawa one . without the yukawa interaction",
    "the theory posses a run - away vacuum .",
    "the model has an @xmath192 gauge symmetry and a @xmath193 anomaly free global symmetry .",
    "as above , the low energy phase that minimizes the number of degrees of freedom is the one that breaks supersymmetry along with both of the global symmetries .",
    "the massless spectrum is the same as in the parent chiral @xmath18 case . in the ( @xmath20 ) model , however ,",
    "the low energy spectrum has been computed @xcite in a self - consistent weak - yukawa coupling approximation , where it was noted that the @xmath194 breaks along with supersymmetry , leaving intact the @xmath195 .",
    "the spectrum consists of two massless fermions ( a goldstino and the fermion associated with the unbroken @xmath195 ) and the @xmath194 goldstone boson . if this is indeed the ground state , then the number of infrared degrees of freedom is not minimized in this weak coupling case .",
    "we have considered the low energy structure of two chiral gauge theories , the bars - yankielowicz ( by ) model and the generalized georgi - glashow ( ggg ) model .",
    "each contains a core of fermions in complex representation of the gauge group , along with a set of @xmath10 additional fundamental - anti - fundamental pairs . in each case , for @xmath10 near but not above the value for which asymptotic freedom is lost , the model will have a weak infrared fixed point and exist in the non - abelian coulomb phase .",
    "as @xmath10 drops , the infrared coupling strengthens and one or more phase transitions to strongly coupled phases are expected .",
    "several possible phases have been identified that are consistent with global anomaly matching , and that satisfy the inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : ineq ] ) for low enough @xmath10 .",
    "one is confinement with the gauge symmetry and additional global symmetries unbroken .",
    "another is confinement with the global symmetry broken to that of the @xmath28 theory .",
    "still another is a higgs phase , with both gauge and chiral symmetries broken .",
    "both symmetry breaking phases correspond to bilinear condensate formation .",
    "the infrared degree of freedom count @xmath2 for each of these phases is shown in figs .",
    "[ byfp ] and [ gggfp ] , along with the corresponding ultraviolet count @xmath8 .",
    "we have suggested that at each value of @xmath10 , these theories will choose the phase that minimizes the degree of freedom count as defined by @xmath2 , or equivalently the phase that minimizes the entropy near freeze - out ( @xmath196 ) . as may be seen from figs .",
    "[ byfp ] and [ gggfp ] , this idea leads to the following picture . as @xmath10 drops below some critical value , the @xmath10 fundamental - anti - fundamental pairs",
    "condense at some scale @xmath197 , breaking the full global symmetry to the symmetry of the @xmath28 theory and producing the associated goldstone bosons .",
    "for the remaining theory with fermions in only complex representations , the phase with the global symmetry unbroken and the global anomalies matched by massless fermions is preferred to phases with further global symmetry breaking via bilinear condensates .",
    "we have not yet shown that this is true relative to all bilinear condensate formation .",
    "also , this does not exclude the possibility that some strongly coupled infrared phase ( such as a strong non abelian coulomb phase ) leads to the smallest value for @xmath2 and is still consistent with global anomaly matching .",
    "we extended our discussion to include general condensate formation for one simple example , the @xmath18 georgi - glashow model with fermions in only complex representations and a single @xmath19 global symmetry .",
    "this symmetry can be broken via only a higher dimensional condensate .",
    "for this model , interestingly , we noted that the breaking of the @xmath19 with confinement and unbroken gauge symmetry leads to the minimum value of @xmath2 among phases that are infrared free .",
    "this highlights the important question of the pattern of symmetry breaking in general chiral theories ( or any theories for that matter ) when arbitrary condensate formation is considered .",
    "higher dimensional condensates could play an important role in the dynamical breaking of symmetries in extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "the enumeration of degrees of freedom in the effective infrared theory is a potentially useful guide to discriminate among the possibilities .    finally , we commented on two supersymmetric chiral models : the supersymmetric version of the @xmath18 georgi - glashow model and the closely related ( @xmath20 ) model .",
    "both have a @xmath198 global symmetry . in each case , the phase that minimizes the number of massless degrees of freedom corresponds to the breaking of susy and both of its global symmetries . in the case of the ( @xmath20 ) model",
    ", however , an analysis in the case of a weak yukawa coupling ( see @xcite for a discussion and relevant references ) leads to the conclusion that the @xmath195 is not broken .",
    "if this truly represents the ground state in the case of weak coupling , then the degree of freedom count is not the minimum among possible phases that respect global anomaly matching .",
    "to summarize , for the nonsupersymmetric chiral gauge theories discussed here , we have identified a variety of possible zero - temperature phases and conjectured that the theories will choose from among them the one that minimizes the infrared degree of freedom count . whether this can be proven and whether the idea plays a role in a wider class of theories remains to be seen .",
