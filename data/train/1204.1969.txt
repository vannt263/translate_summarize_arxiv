    "the class of the b[e ] stars comprises some of the most peculiar and mysterious objects of stellar astrophysics . in particular , it has been found that the class - defining characteristics , which include infrared excess and strong permitted and forbidden line emission , are observed in a wide range of evolutionary stages , including stars of pre - main - sequence , post - main - sequence , and unknown nature ( unclassified b[e ] stars , @xcite ) .",
    "an enigmatic member of the latter category is ( = hen3 - 1300 , mwc865 , cd-42@xmath711721 ) . despite more than one hundred studies that have been conducted over the last four decades ,",
    "the stellar parameters and evolutionary stage of v921sco remain strongly debated .",
    "these uncertainties arise primarily from problems in distance estimation , where values between 160  pc @xcite and 2.6  kpc @xcite have been proposed . furthermore , due to the lack of photospheric lines in the optical spectrum , the existing spectral classifications are based on rather indirect methods , such as photometric modeling or the ionization analysis of circumstellar emission lines .",
    "accordingly , the derived effective temperatures ( 12,300  k to 31,600  k ; @xcite ) and spectral types ( aep to b0[e]p ; @xcite ) exhibit a considerable spread , which prevents a clear hertzsprung - russell diagram classification and has lead authors to argue both for an evolved ( supergiant ; @xcite ) and young ( herbig  b[e ] ; @xcite ) object nature .",
    "the aim of this paper is to gain new insights on the astrophysical nature of v921sco , and b[e ] stars in general , by studying the spatial distribution and kinematics of the circumstellar gas and dust .",
    "these constraints will inform us about the disk - formation mechanism ( i.e.  accretion versus excretion ) , and , thus , the evolutionary state of v921sco . for instance , accretion disks around young stars are believed to exhibit a keplerian rotation profile , while the radiation - driven winds from evolved stars should exhibit a strong outflowing velocity component @xcite .",
    "given the possible kiloparsec distance of v921sco , this task requires both high angular and high spectral resolution , which we achieve in our study by combining , for the first time , two highly complementary techniques , namely spectro - interferometry ( vlti / amber , providing milliarcsecond angular resolution and spectral resolution @xmath8 ) and spectro - astrometry ( vlt / crires , @xmath9 ) . from these spatially and spectrally resolved constraints , we derive the gas velocity field on scales down to a few stellar radii .    in a recent study ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i ) , we already obtained milliarcsecond - resolution continuum interferometric images of v921sco in three wavelength bands ( 1.65 , 2.0 , and 2.3  @xmath10 m ) and discovered a close ( separation @xmath11  milliarcseconds = mas ) companion , as well as a continuum - emitting disk with an apparent size of @xmath12  mas ( gaussian fwhm along major axis ) .",
    "in addition , we obtained images of the surrounding large - scale bipolar nebula and detected multi - layered , shell - like substructures that might have been shaped by episodic mass - loss events . based on roughly matching timescales between the estimated orbital period and the mass - ejection period , we suggested that the mass - ejection events might be triggered by the newly discovered companion .",
    "for the stellar parameters of v921sco , we adopt in this study a luminosity @xmath13 , effective temperature @xmath14  k , a distance of @xmath15  pc , @xmath16 , and a stellar radius of @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "the measured visibility amplitudes , closure phases , and wavelength - differential phases ( dps ) provide powerful constraints for model - fitting or can be used for the reconstruction of interferometric images .",
    "first spectro - interferometric observations on v921sco using the vlti near - infrared beam combiner instrument amber @xcite were presented by @xcite , @xcite , and in paper  i and provided low ( lr - hk , @xmath19 ) and medium ( mr - k , @xmath20 ) spectral resolution . here , we present new observations using amber s unique high spectral resolution mode ( hr - k , @xmath8 ) .",
    "the new data sets were obtained on 2010 - 03 - 03 and 2010 - 08 - 26 using the 8.2 m unit telescopes ut2 , ut3 , and ut4 and cover a wavelength window around the 2.16602  @xmath10 m line .    in order to yield sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for our high spectral resolution observations , we employed the finito fringe tracker instrument @xcite . this instrument measures and corrects the atmosphere - induced phase perturbations and allowed us to record the optical path delay ( opd)-stabilized interferograms with a long detector integration time of 3s .",
    "unfortunately , the tracking performance of finito was degraded for the longest baselines due to the low visibility contrast in this baseline regime .",
    "based on the poor snr , we rejected the visibility measurements for one baseline from 2010 - 03 - 03 ( ut2-ut4 ) and two baselines from 2010 - 08 - 26 ( ut2-ut4 , ut3-ut4 ) .",

    "we investigated the influence of frame selection in the course of our data reduction procedure and find that the wavelength - differential signatures are very robust when selecting , for instance , the 80% , 50% , 20% , or 10% of frames with the best snr .",
    "given that the statistical noise increases with decreasing frame number and that low - snr frames are down - weighted during the averaging process in a natural fashion , we decided to employ the observables from the full , unselected data sets for our analysis .    in order to associate the closure phase sign with the on - sky orientation , we use a reference data set on the binary star @xmath25orionis  c @xcite .",
    "to calibrate the wavelength - differential phases , we make use of the fact that the continuum photocenter is systematically offset with respect to the -line emission due to the presence of a close companion star . using the well - established continuum closure phase sign calibration",
    ", we first determine the position angle ( pa ) of the companion star ( sect .",
    "[ sec : continuum ] ) and then adjust the dp sign in our spectro - interferometric and spectro - astrometric data in order to match the direction of the continuum photocenter displacement .",
    "this procedure calibrates the dp sign unambiguously , and might serve also as a reference for other studies using amber s hr - mode .",
    "recently , we employed this calibration in order to determine the rotation sense of the disk around the classical be star @xmath26cmi @xcite . since @xmath26cmi was observed using both amber s mr and hr - mode , we can also extend the calibration to amber mr - mode observations , which resulted in a recalibration of the @xmath27tau rotation sense @xcite compared to earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the statistical error bars on the dps vary strongly for the different baselines , which is both a result of the low fringe contrast at the longest baselines and of differences in the vibration properties of the uts .",
    "these differences might give overproportional weight to the short baselines in our @xmath28-fitting procesure .",
