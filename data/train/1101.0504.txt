    "in the usual bose - hubbard model  @xcite , competition between the kinetic and potential energy terms leads to two phases : a mott insulator ( mi ) when the kinetic energy is much smaller than the potential energy and a superfluid ( sf ) otherwise .",
    "the incompressible mi phase has an excitation gap so that the incoherent bosons are localized , and that a slight change in the chemical potential does not change the number of bosons on a particular lattice site .",
    "the compressible sf phase , however , is gapless , and the coherent bosons are delocalized over the entire lattice .    recent advances with ultracold bosonic atoms loaded into optical lattices have made it possible to simulate bose - hubbard type many - particle hamiltonians in a tunable setting .",
    "for instance , the ability to control on - site boson - boson interactions has paved the way for observing sf and mi phases as well as the transition between the two  @xcite . in addition , a new technique has recently been developed that allowed the production of fictitious magnetic fields which can couple to neutral bosonic atoms  @xcite .",
    "these fictitious magnetic fields are produced through an all optical raman process , couple to a fictitious charge , but produce real effects like the creation of vortices in the sf state of bosons . such an ability to control the strength of the fictitious magnetic fields combined with the ability to control the strength of the interparticle interactions may allow exploration of new phenomena in the near future  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to its simplicity , the bose - hubbard model is not exactly solvable even in one dimension .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have a much simpler toy - model which exhibits all the salient properties of the bose - hubbard model , while also being more amenable to analytical treatment .",
    "one of the most prominent candidates is the hardcore bose - hubbard model on a checkerboard superlattice , for which the existence of sf and mi phases at half filling in three dimensions  @xcite , as well as a direct transition between the two  @xcite have rigorously been shown .",
    "in addition , this model and its correlation functions are exactly solvable in one dimension  @xcite , thanks to the existence of a mapping between the hardcore bosons and noninteracting fermions . in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", we have recently analyzed the ground - state phase diagram of this model in one , two and three dimensions using mean - field approximation and strong - coupling expansion , and compared them with the numerically exact results obtained from the stochastic series expansion algorithm followed by finite - size scaling  @xcite .",
    "given that checkerboard superlattices have already been realized  @xcite using multiple wavelength laser beams , we extend previous works in two important directions .",
    "first , we relax the hardcore constraint and study the ground - state phase diagram of the softcore bose - hubbard model on a checkerboard superlattice , via mean - field decoupling approximation .",
    "second , we study the effects of uniform magnetic field on the ground - state phase diagram in two dimensions .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . first , we review the model at hand in sec .  [",
    "sec : ham ] , and present a qualitative description of its phase diagram .",
    "then , we study the single - particle hofstadter problem in sec .  [ sec : single ] , and show that the presence of a checkerboard superlattice gives rise to a magnetic flux - independent energy gap in the excitation spectrum . the many - particle problem is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : many ] , where we derive analytical expressions for the sf - insulator phase transition boundaries within the mean - field decoupling approximation .",
    "then , we give a brief discussion and summary of our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper with appendix a , where an analytical mean - field expression for the sf - insulator phase transition boundaries is derived for the extended bose - hubbard model .",
    "in this paper we study the effects of magnetic field on the bose - hubbard model on a checkerboard superlattice . for this purpose , we consider a two - dimensional square lattice described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) creates ( annihilates ) a boson on site @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the on - site boson number operator . the hopping matrix @xmath5 is assumed to connect two nearest - neighbor lattice sites ( @xmath6 for @xmath3 and @xmath7 nearest neighbors and @xmath8 otherwise ) belonging to different sublattices , _",
    "e.g. _ the even sublattice @xmath9 and the odd one @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the strength of the on - site boson - boson repulsion , @xmath12 is the chemical potential , and @xmath13 is the amplitude of the alternating checkerboard superlattice potential such that @xmath14 @xmath15 on sublattice @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the phase factor @xmath16 takes into account the effects of a uniform magnetic field that is applied perpendicular to the lattice , where @xmath17 is the vector potential and @xmath18 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "all of our results recover the nonmagnetic ones when the magnetic flux tends to 0 .",
    "let us first analyze the atomic ( @xmath19 ) limit of this hamiltonian at zero - temperature . in this limit",
    ", there is no kinetic term , and the boson number operator @xmath20 commutes with the hamiltonian , so every lattice site is occupied by a fixed number @xmath21 of bosons . here",
    ", @xmath22 is the thermal average , and the average boson occupancy @xmath23 is chosen to minimize the ground - state energy for a given @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath24 , this model is translationally invariant , and the ground - state boson occupancy is the same for all sites .",
    "for instance , in the hardcore boson ( @xmath25 ) limit  @xcite , while the lattice is completely empty for @xmath26 and the minimal energy configuration corresponds to a vacuum of particles or a hole band insulator ( vp , since @xmath27 for all @xmath3 ) , it is completely full for @xmath28 and the minimal energy configuration corresponds to a vacuum of holes or a particle band insulator ( vh , since @xmath29 for all @xmath3 ) .",
    "the ground - state energy of these phases is degenerate at @xmath30 .",
    "however , when @xmath31 , the ground state has an additional half - filled insulating ( incompressible ) phase characterized by a crystalline order in the form of staggered boson densities . for the nearest neighbor lattice sites @xmath3 and @xmath7 , @xmath32 for the sublattice @xmath9 and @xmath33 for the sublattice @xmath10 .",
    "this phase resides in the region @xmath34 , and it is sandwiched between the vp and vh phases . since the checkerboard superlattice breaks the translational invariance of the lattice , it directly causes such an alternating density pattern . for this reason , this phase",
    "is often called a mi  @xcite , to distinguish it from a true charge - density - wave ( cdw ) phase , for which the translational invariance is broken spontaneously due for instance to the presence of nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "( see appendix a ) . in this paper , for simplicity we call this alternating density pattern an alternating mi ( ami ) with @xmath35 fillings to prevent confusion .    on one hand , for softcore bosons with @xmath36 , the ground state alternates between the ami and mi phases as a function of increasing @xmath12 , where the chemical potential widths of ami and mi lobes are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : softpd ] ) . on the other hand , for softcore bosons with @xmath39 ,",
    "the ground state has only ami insulators .",
    "for instance ,",
    "when @xmath40 , the ground state is a vp with @xmath41 fillings for @xmath42 ; it is an ami with @xmath35 fillings for @xmath12 between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; it is an ami with @xmath45 fillings for @xmath12 between @xmath44 and @xmath46 ; it is an ami with @xmath47 fillings for @xmath12 between @xmath46 and @xmath48 ; it is an ami with @xmath49 fillings for @xmath12 between @xmath48 and @xmath50 , and so on .",
    "as @xmath51 increases , the range of @xmath12 about which the ground state is insulating decreases , and the mi and ami phases disappear at a critical value of @xmath51 , beyond which the system becomes compressible .",
    "we note that , unlike the compressible sf phase of the usual bose - hubbard model , the compressible phase in this model is more like a supersolid ( ss ) , where the sf and ami orders coexist even for arbitrarily small @xmath46 .",
    "however , since the checkerboard superlattice breaks the translational invariance of the lattice , we call the compressible phase of this model a sf to distinguish it from a true ss for which the translational invariance is broken spontaneously . having discussed the atomic limit , let us now discuss the noninteracting single - particle energy spectrum when @xmath52 .",
    "in the absence of a checkerboard superlattice , i.e. when @xmath24 , the single - particle excitation spectrum is the usual hofstadter butterfly  @xcite , and here we generalize it to @xmath53 . for this purpose , we choose the landau gauge for the vector potential [ @xmath54 , which leads to a uniform @xmath55 field in the @xmath56 direction , and the strength of the magnetic field @xmath57 is related to the magnetic flux @xmath58 via @xmath59 . denoting the coordinates of lattice sites by @xmath60",

    "considered , the period @xmath77 @xmath78 for even ( odd ) @xmath74 values .",
    "therefore , the bloch theorem tells us that the 1st magnetic brillouin zone is determined by @xmath79 and @xmath80 this increased periodicity motivates us to work with a supercell of @xmath81 sites ( in @xmath62 and @xmath66 directions , respectively ) as shown in fig .",

    "<S> we study the effects of an artificial gauge field on the ground - state phases of the bose - hubbard model on a checkerboard superlattice in two dimensions , including the superfluid phase and the mott and alternating mott insulators . </S>",
    "<S> first , we discuss the single - particle hofstadter problem , and show that the presence of a checkerboard superlattice gives rise to a magnetic flux - independent energy gap in the excitation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> then , we consider the many - particle problem , and derive an analytical mean - field expression for the superfluid - mott and superfluid  alternating - mott insulator phase transition boundaries . finally , since the phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model on a checkerboard superlattice is in many ways similar to that of the extended bose - hubbard model , we comment on the effects of magnetic field on the latter model , and derive an analytical mean - field expression for the superfluid - insulator phase transition boundaries as well . </S>"
