    "there is fairly convincing observational evidence that the universe is now undergoing accelerated expansion . in the context of einstein s",
    "general theory of relativity ( gr ) this amounts to saying that some sort of dark energy , constant or that varies slowly with time and in space , dominates the current energy budget of the cosmos . on the other hand , it is also conceivable that the current accelerated expansion could be an indication that gr does not provide an adequate description of gravity on cosmological length scales . for recent reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "while there are many options , if gr is assumed to be the correct model of gravitation , the current consensus opinion is that the simplest possible driver of this accelerated expansion is a cosmological constant , @xmath0 , a spatially homogeneous fluid with equation of state @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the fluid pressure and energy density ) or equation of state parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this `` standard '' @xmath0cdm model  @xcite , where cold dark matter ( cdm ) is the second largest contributor to the cosmological energy budget after @xmath0 , allows for a good fit to many curent observations .",
    "however , the needed @xmath0 energy density scale of order @xmath5 ev is very small and difficult to reconcile with the much higher value that a naive application of quantum mechanics suggests .",
    "furthermore , as the density of nonrelativistic matter ( the cdm and baryonic matter ) decreases during the cosmological expansion while the @xmath0 energy density remains constant , these two energy densities are comparable in magnitude only for a relatively short time and it is puzzling why we happen to observe near this epoch ( this is the so - called coincidence puzzle ) .    motivated by the fact that instead of a cosmological constant , if the energy density responsible for the accelerated expansion  the dark energy  also decreased in time , the energy densities of nonrelativistic matter and dark energy would be comparable for a somewhat longer period , it is of interest to consider models where the dark energy density decreases with time .",
    "a simple example is the xcdm parametrization of dark energy , where dark energy is modeled by a spatially homogeneous fluid with equation of state @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "while the xcdm parametrization is widely used , it is well known that it is not a complete parametrization as it can not describe spatial inhomogeneities ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath8cdm model @xcite , in which dark energy is taken to be a scalar field @xmath8 with a potential energy density @xmath9 that results in a dark energy density that is close to spatially homogeneous but slowly decreasing in time , provides a complete description of dark energy , unlike the xcdm parametrization .",
    "see , e.g. @xcite for more recent discussions about this model .    rather than introducing a new dark energy component ,",
    "explanation of the accelerated cosmological expansion has been sought in modifications of gr , including the possible existence of extra dimensions ( e.g. @xcite ) or by modifying gr by adding terms proportional to powers of the ricci scalar @xmath10 to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given the state of uncertainty that remains over whether @xmath0 may or may not provide a complete explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration , a very important way to improve our understanding of this phenomenon is to use cosmological observations to constrain mechanisms of cosmic acceleration .",
    "in this regard , it is worth emphasizing that using different observational techniques , as well as combinations of them , is particularly important for a more reliable determination of cosmological parameters , since different methods may rule out different regions of the parameter space and , therefore , may be complementary to each other .    in this paper",
    "we combine distance data with low and high - redshift time measurements to constrain accelerating cosmologies .",
    "specifically , we use age measurements of 32 passively evolving galaxies  @xcite ( in the range @xmath11 ) to perform a statistical analysis of the age-@xmath12 test . in order to better constrain the parameter spaces of these models ,",
    "we combine the age-@xmath12 data with a recent estimate of the ratio of the cmb acoustic scale @xmath13 and the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak , the so - called cmb / bao ratio  @xcite .",
    "we show that for some models the age-@xmath12 plus cmb / bao ratio data analysis results in restrictive joint constraints on these cosmologies .",
    "we discuss our results in terms of two information criteria , namely , the akaike information criterion  @xcite and the bayesian information criterion  @xcite .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in sec .  2 we present the basic equations of , and main motivations for , the accelerating cosmological models we consider in our analyses .",
    "the age - redshift test and the joint analysis of this data with the cmb / bao ratio data are outlined in sec .",
    "our results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "4 . in sec .  5",
    "we summarize our main results .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , theoretical models of cosmic acceleration can be broadly classed into two groups : those that introduce a new component to the composition of the universe ( this includes the `` standard '' @xmath0cdm case ) and those that invoke a modification to the equations governing gravity . in what follows ,",
    "we briefly discuss some of the more popular nonstandard models and examine whether they are consistent with current age and distance data . unless specified otherwise , we assume vanishing spatial curvature .      for some potential energy density functions , @xmath9 , the @xmath8cdm model",
    "partially resolves two theoretical puzzles of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "for example , with an inverse power potential @xmath14 with @xmath15  @xcite the solution of the coupled nonlinear equations of motion is an attractor for which the scalar field energy density , @xmath16 , decreases less rapidly than the dominant component of the energy density in the radiation- and matter - domianted epochs and so eventually comes to dominate , thus partially resolving the coincidence puzzle . also , the slow decrease in time of the dark energy density in this model results in a very small dark energy density now because the universe is old .",
    "consequently , instead of a new fundamental energy density scale of order a mev as in the @xmath0cdm model , the @xmath8cdm model requires a higher fundamental energy density scale that is determined by when the phenomenological @xmath8cdm model first provides an appropriate description of cosmology .    with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a constant , the dynamics of the @xmath8cdm model",
    "is obtained by solving the equations @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the hubble parameter , @xmath22 is the pressureless matter ( baryons and cold dark matter ) energy density and a dot denotes a derivative with respect to time .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 describes the steepness of the scalar field potential , with larger ( smaller ) values of @xmath23 corresponding to faster ( slower ) evolution of the scalar field . in the limit @xmath24 the spatially - flat @xmath8cdm model reduces to the spatially - flat @xmath0cdm case .",
    "the observational viability of this model has been extensively investigated in the literature and we refer the reader to @xcite .      from the cosmological viewpoint ,",
    "the main distinction between pressureless cdm and dark energy is that the former agglomerates at small length scales whereas the latter is a smooth component on these scales .",
    "recently , the idea of a unified description for cdm and dark energy has received much attention ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting attempt in this direction was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and further developed in ref .",
    "it uses to an exotic fluid , the so - called chaplygin gas ( cg ) , whose equation of state is given by @xmath25 actually , this equation for @xmath26 is a generalization of the original cg equation of state and was originally proposed in @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . in our analyses , we will consider both the original cg ( @xmath27 ) and its generalization ( gcg ) .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "( [ cgeos ] ) into the energy conservation equation gives the expression for the gcg energy density @xmath28^{\\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha}},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the cosmological scale factor and @xmath30 is a quantity related to the sound speed for the generalized chaplygin gas today ( throughout this paper the subscript `` 0 '' denotes present - day quantities ) . as can be seen from the above equations , the chaplygin gas interpolates between epochs dominated by non - relativistic matter [ @xmath31 and by a negative - pressure time - independent dark `` energy '' [ @xmath32 .",
    "a phenomenological attempt at alleviating the cosmological constant problems mentioned earlier is based on allowing the dark matter and dark energy to interact . for this class of models , the energy balance equation between a quintessence component @xmath8 and cdm particles must be of the form @xmath33",
    "the dark matter - dark energy interaction implies that the energy density of the former component must dilute at a different rate compared to its standard evolution @xmath34 ( alcaniz 2006 ) .",
    "if we characterize this non - standard evolution by an arbitrary function @xmath35 such that @xmath36 the energy density of the @xmath8 component can be written as ( costa 2010 ) @xmath37}{\\tilde{a}^{1 -3w_{\\phi } - \\epsilon(a ) } } d\\tilde{a } \\right]a^{-3(1+w_{\\phi})}\\;.\\ ] ] for @xmath38 the above expression reduces to the vacuum decay model discussed by costa & alcaniz ( 2010 ) , whereas for a constant @xmath39 one recovers the coupled quintessence scenario studied by jesus et al .",
    "note also that the ( incomplete ) xcdm parametrization is recovered for @xmath40 .    for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our analyses to coupled quintessence models in which @xmath41 and @xmath42 , so that @xmath43 which is mathematically equivalent to the decaying vacuum scenarios proposed by wang & meng ( 2005 ) and alcaniz & lima ( 2005 ) ( see amendola 2000 ; dalal et al .",

    "here we consider the dgp model ( dvali et al .",
    "2000 ) , a self - accelerating 5-dimensional model with a non - compact , infinite - volume extra dimension , whose gravitational dynamics is governed by a competition between a 4-dimensional ricci scalar term induced on the brane and an ordinary 5-dimensional einstein - hilbert action ( for a review of dgp phenomenology , see lue 2006 ) .",

    "2001 ; alcaniz 2002 ; guo et al .  2006 ) . for this scenario",
    "we analyze both flat ( flat dgp ) and arbitrary - curvature cases ( dgp ) .",
    "also based on extra dimensions , freese & lewis ( 2002 ) proposed the cardassian model in which the universe is spatially flat , matter dominated , and currently undergoing accelerated expansion .",
    "such a behavior is obtained from a modified friedmann equation on our observable brane with @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is an arbitrary function of the matter energy density . although completely different physically , the original cardassian model with @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are functions of the matter density @xmath22 and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are free parameters of the model ) predicts the same observational effects as the xcdm parametrization for cosmological tests based on the evolution of the hubble parameter with redshift .    here , we consider the generalized cardassian ( gcard ) model described by wang et al .",

    "<S> the absence of guidance from fundamental physics about the mechanism behind cosmic acceleration has given rise to a number of alternative cosmological scenarios . </S>",

    "<S> we investigate the observational viability of some accelerating cosmological models in light of 32 age measurements of passively evolving galaxies as a function of redshift and recent estimates of the product of the cosmic microwave background acoustic scale and the baryonic acoustic oscillation peak scale . by using information - criteria model selection , </S>",
    "<S> we select the best - fit models and rank the alternative scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we show that some of these models may provide a better fit to the data than does the current standard cosmological constant dominated ( @xmath0cdm ) model . </S>"
