    "the motivation for the development of the results reported in this paper has been the need to construct tools for studying the probabilistic limit behaviour of ( realised ) quadratic variation and other multipower variations in relation to the class of _ brownian semistationary _ ( @xmath7 ) processes .",
    "this class , which was introduced in @xcite , consists of the processes @xmath8 that are defined by@xmath9 where @xmath10 is a constant ; @xmath4 is a brownian measure on @xmath11 ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are non - negative deterministic functions on @xmath11 , with @xmath14 for @xmath15 ; and @xmath6 and @xmath16 are cadlag processes .",
    "when @xmath6 and @xmath16 are stationary , so is @xmath0 .",
    "hence the name brownian semistationary processes .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fractional ornstein  uhlenbeck process is , in fact , also representable in the form ( [ bss ] ) .",
    "the same is true of a wide class of stable pseudo - moving average processes ; see corollary  4.3 in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 processes form the natural analogue , for stationarity related processes , to the class @xmath17 of brownian semimartingales @xmath18 in the context of stochastic modelling in finance and in turbulence , the process @xmath6 embodies the _ volatility _ or _",
    "intermittency _ of the dynamics , whether the framework is that of @xmath17 or @xmath19 . for detailed discussion of @xmath7 and the more general concept of tempo - spatial ambit processes",
    "see @xcite .",
    "such processes are , in particular , able to reproduce key stylized features of turbulent data .",
    "a main difference between @xmath17 and @xmath7 is that , in general , models of the @xmath7 form are not semimartingales ( for a discussion of this , see section 3 of @xcite ) . in consequence , various important techniques developed for semimartingales , such as the calculation of quadratic variation by it calculus and those of multipower variation , do not apply or suffice in @xmath7 settings .",
    "the present paper addresses some of the issues that this raises .",
    "the theory of multipower variation was primarily developed as a basis for inference on @xmath6 under @xmath17 models and , more generally , it semimartingales , with particular focus on inference about the integrated squared volatility @xmath20 given by@xmath21 this quantity is likewise a focal point for the results discussed in the following .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] introduces common notation for multipower variation and recalls some basic properties of such quantities .",
    "a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for multipower variation of triangular arrays of gaussian random variables are derived in section  [ sec3 ] , and these limit results are drawn upon in section  [ sec4 ] to establish probability and central limit theorems for multipower variation for @xmath7  processes , with most of the proofs postponed to section  [ sec8 ] .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] presents several examples and section  [ sec6 ] discusses an application concerning the limit behaviour of the realised variation ratio , that is , the ratio of realised bipower variation to realised quadratic variation .",
    "section  [ sec7 ] concludes and indicates some possible directions for further related work .",

    "let us consider the realised variation ratio ( rvr ) defined for a stochastic process @xmath22 as @xmath289 the rvr is of interest as a diagnostic tool concerning the nature of empirical processes .",
    "in particular , it can be used to test the hypothesis that such a process is a brownian semimartingale ( with a non - trivial local martingale component ) against the possibility that it is of this type plus a jump process , see @xcite ( some related work is discussed in woe08 ) .",
    "if a jump component is present , then the limit of @xmath290 is smaller than @xmath67 .",
    "however , in the course of the turbulence project , mentioned earlier , when calculating the rvr for an extensive high - quality data set from atmospheric turbulence it turned out that the values of rvr were consistently higher than @xmath67 .",
    "the wish to understand this phenomenon has been a strong motivation for the theoretical developments described in this paper . as a consequence of theorem [ th3 ] , we obtain the following probability limit result for the realised variation ratio of @xmath7 processes : @xmath291 where    @xmath292    which equals @xmath293 of two standard normal variables @xmath294 and @xmath295  with correlation @xmath296 .    moreover , we have that @xmath297 so , if the parameter @xmath298 , by applying theorems [ th3 ] and [ th4 ] , we obtain    @xmath299    where @xmath300 is as above and the matrix @xmath93 is given in theorem [ th2 ] . specifically , we find @xmath301 , where@xmath302 with @xmath303  as defined in theorem  [ th2 ] .",
