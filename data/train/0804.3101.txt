    "a system of differential equations is said to be _ piecewise - smooth _ if it is everywhere smooth except on some codimension - one boundaries called _ switching manifolds_. this paper is concerned with such systems that are continuous everywhere but non - differentiable on switching manifolds .",
    "piecewise - smooth continuous systems have been utilized to model a range of diverse physical situations , for instance vibro - impacting mechanical systems @xcite , switching in electrical circuits @xcite and various non - smooth phenomena in biology and physiology @xcite .",
    "the interaction of invariant sets with switching manifolds often produces bifurcations not seen in smooth systems .",
    "the last two decades have seen an explosion of interest in such bifurcations and many new results , see for instance @xcite and references within . in the neighborhood of a single switching manifold a piecewise - smooth , continuous system may be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are @xmath3 and @xmath4 is sufficiently smooth .",
    "the switching manifold is the set @xmath5 and by continuity , @xmath6 on @xmath7 .",
    "a point @xmath8 is an equilibrium of the left - half - system if @xmath9 and is said to be _ admissible _ if @xmath10 and _ virtual _ otherwise ( and vice - versa for the right - half - system ) . by continuity of ( [ eq : gensys ] ) ,",
    "an equilibrium that lies exactly on @xmath7 is an admissible equilibrium of both smooth half - systems .",
    "this codimension - one phenomenon generally gives rise to what is known as a _ discontinuous bifurcation _ ( sometimes called a _ boundary equilibrium bifurcation _ ) for which there are two basic generic scenarios .",
    "either equilibria in the two half - systems coexist , collide and annihilate on the switching manifold ( _ non - smooth saddle - node _ ) or one equilibrium is admissible on each side of the bifurcation ( _ persistence _ ) .",
    "in addition , other invariant sets may be created at the bifurcation , such as a periodic orbit in a manner akin to an andronov - hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "even though linear terms of an appropriate series expansion of the system generally completely determine dynamical behavior local to a discontinuous bifurcation , in a general @xmath11-dimensional system the bifurcation may be extremely complex .",
    "much work has been done for low ( @xmath12 ) dimensional systems @xcite . in two - dimensions ,",
    "if a periodic orbit emanates from a generic discontinuous bifurcation , it must encircle an equilibrium of focus type @xcite . in this paper",
    "we unfold about the codimension - two point where the focus - type equilibrium has purely imaginary eigenvalues at the crossing point .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the simultaneous occurrence of a discontinuous bifurcation and a ( smooth ) andronov - hopf bifurcation and has recently been observed in a model of yeast growth @xcite .",
    "we find that as parameters are changed to move away from the hopf bifurcation , the associated hopf cycle grows in size as usual , until grazing the switching manifold .",
    "no bifurcation occurs at the grazing point in the sense that the phase portrait does not change topologically ( because the system is continuous at the switching manifold @xcite ) .",
    "however , very shortly beyond the grazing bifurcation a saddle - node bifurcation of the orbit may occur .",
    "we derive a condition governing when this occurs and a scaling law describing how close to the grazing the saddle - node bifurcation occurs .",
    "our results are presented in theorem [ th : c22dhb ] .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : prelim ] we transform the general system to a normal form involving companion matrices and state the theorem . in  [ sec : example ] we provide a simple example and use it to illustrate the theorem and numerically verify predicted scaling laws .
