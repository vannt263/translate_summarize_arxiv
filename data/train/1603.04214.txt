    "it is really lucrative to make a discretization scheme for this @xmath1 which allow us to use @xmath18 .",
    "the grid used for discretization is a set of points @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an integer and shows the number of mesh points in the @xmath25 domain which may be determined properly based on the fluctuations of the functions .",

    "for the isolated system , the exact analytical solution of the equation for @xmath121 can straightforwardly be found as : @xmath135 in this case the @xmath18 solutions for real and imaginary parts of @xmath121 are shown in figures [ fig - c12 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively where in them @xmath136 stands for the @xmath137 and @xmath138 entry of @xmath121 matrix . clearly @xmath18 results for elements of @xmath121 matrix are in excellent agreement with ones which obtained from analytical solutions .",

    "unfortunately analytical solution for this system is intractable but its numerical solution using @xmath18 led to calculate real and imaginary parts of @xmath121 ( figures  [ fig - c34 ] ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively ) .",
    "dissipative behaviour of elements of the teo may be regarded as a good physical proof for `` interacting '' nature of the system .    to illustrate both advantages and deficiencies of the @xmath18 ,",
    "comparison of it with dyson series method and @xmath4 family methods is appropriate .",
    "figure [ fig - error ] ( a ) shows the error estimates for four distinct conditions for a short period of time after its initial condition @xmath151 . in an isolated system `` without any interactions with electrode '' ; i.e. [ @xmath132 in equations   and  ] ; the @xmath1 equation   is modified to a trivial partial differential equation(@xmath152 ) so @xmath4 family methods may be the best choice to solve it since @xmath4 family methods are faster and more accurate than other ones [ dashed line in figure [ fig - error ] ( a ) ] . turning the `` interactions '' on , a general volterra @xmath1 [ equation  ] must be solved .",

    "applying the teo on the charge density one may find the propagation of it in the system during a specific time .",

    "the snapshots of the @xmath172 at different times are shown in figure  [ fig - snapshots ] . at the time @xmath173 this electron wave packet collides to the right lead and diffracts [ see the figure  [ fig - snapshots](d ) ] .",
