    "it is now widely accepted that all galaxies with a massive bulge component contain a central massive black hole ( bh ) .",
    "application of stellar dynamical and gas dynamical techniques for measuring masses of central bhs in normal galaxies has led to the identification of correlations between the bhs and host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the tightest of these relationships are the correlations of bh mass ( @xmath2 ) with the galaxy bulge luminosity and the bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "massive bhs have also been postulated in quasars and active galaxies @xcite .",
    "the question of whether agns follow a similar bh - bulge relation as normal galaxies is a very interesting one , since it may elucidate the connection between the host galaxy and the active nucleus .",
    "comparisons between the bulge and bh properties in quasars and bright seyfert galaxies is observationally very difficult , however , since the stellar component near the bh is easily lost in the glare of the active nucleus .",
    "reverberation mapping ( e.g. blandford @xmath12 mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ; netzer @xmath12 peterson 1997 ; peterson et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) of the broad emission lines in agns has been used to determine the size of the broad line region ( blr ) , @xmath13=c@xmath14 , where @xmath14 is the time lag between continuum and emission line variations . assuming that the widths of permitted emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath15 ) are due to virialized gas motions in the bh potential , the bh mass can be estimated from the velocity dispersion @xmath16 and the radius at the location of the gas @xmath13 .",
    "the central bh mass is then given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a factor of order unity that depends on the structure and geometry of the blr .",
    "multiple line observations show an anticorrelation between emission - line lags and line widths , i.e. , @xmath19 @xcite , which strongly supports the interpretation that the blr dynamics are dominated by the bh gravitational potential .",
    "thus , reverberation mapping provides an important technique for estimating the central bh masses of agns .",
    "the most complete reverberation - based bh masses can be found in @xcite .",
    "another important result of reverberation mapping is the discovery of a simple power law relationship between the continuum luminosity and the size of blr , @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath21 using optical wavelengths and the broad balmer emission lines , and after correcting for the contribution of host galaxy light , is found to be @xmath22 , which is consistent with simple photoionization expectations @xcite .",
    "the radius - luminosity relationship provides a secondary method of estimating the bh masses , suitable for use with single - epoch spectra .",
    "the single - epoch spectra technique has been applied to large samples of broad line agns to estimate bh masses @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of measuring the host bulge properties remains , however .",
    "image decomposition techniques can separate the host from the central agns in some cases ( e.g. mclure et al . 2000 ; peng et al .",
    "2002 , kulbroadt et al .",
    "2004 , bentz et al .",
    "2006 ) , but they do not provide the necessary spectroscopic information , such as the stellar absorption lines that are necessary for measuring host galaxy stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "host galaxy stellar velocity dispersions have been directly measured in some cases by fitting the stellar absorption lines of the caii triplet at a wavelength of @xmath23 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the caii triplet is difficult to observe for large samples of agns , for the following three reasons .",
    "first , the lines are often redshifted out of the observable spectral range .",
    "second , the lines are usually contaminated by night sky emission and absorption features . finally , the host galaxy is usually very faint as compared to the active nucleus , causing the absorption lines to be very weak in contrast to the nuclear continuum . when the caii triplet is not available , the [ oiii]@xmath24 narrow emission line is sometimes used as a surrogate for estimating the stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "however , while there is a correlation between the width of [ oiii ] and @xmath0 measured from absorption lines , the scatter in the relationship is substantial @xcite .",
    "so while the width of [ oiii ] may be used as a surrogate for @xmath0 in a statistical sense , the bh mass estimated from [ oiii ] can be uncertain by a factor of 5 @xcite .",
    "thus , the published measurements of host galaxy velocity dispersions for seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars are few in number ( @xmath25 ) , which prevent statistically significant investigations of the @xmath26-@xmath0 relationship .    principal component analysis ( pca ) has been performed on both galaxy @xcite and quasar @xcite samples from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have shown that galaxies and quasars can be classified based on only a few eigencoefficients in each case .",
    "the galaxy spectroscopic sample variance is strongly concentrated in just the first few eigenspectra , with over @xmath27 of the information contained in the first three eigenspectra @xcite .",
    "the quasar information is not as strongly concentrated as in the case of galaxies , but the first 10 quasar eigenspectra account for @xmath28 of the sample variance @xcite . at low luminosities ,",

    "their tests showed that the technique accurately reproduces the host galaxy spectrum , its contributing flux fraction , and its classification .",
    "inspired by the success of the spectral decomposition , we have separated the host galaxies from the broad line agns in a large sample of spectra using the technique of vb06 . among the merits of this method",
    "is that a large sample of host galaxy spectra is available from which the stellar velocity dispersions can be measured by the stellar absorption lines .",
    "another advantage of this method is that the bh masses are more accurately measured by using the host - subtracted agns than by using composite spectra , especially when host galaxy contributions are not negligible @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the bh - bulge relationships for active galaxies in a more statistically meaningful way , given that we can obtain both host and agn properties for a large number of objects .",

    "the total spectral integration time is at least 45 minutes .",
    "we define broad - line agns here to mean any extragalactic object with at least one spectroscopic emission line with a fwhm of at least @xmath41 , regardless of the object luminosity or morphology .",
    "broad - line agn candidates are selected from sdss color space , or as unresolved matches to sources in the first radio catalog @xcite , as described by @xcite .",
    "quasars are also often identified because the objects were targeted for spectroscopy by non - quasar selection algorithms , such as optical matches to rosat sources @xcite , various classes of stars @xcite , so - called serendipity objects @xcite , and galaxies @xcite .",
    "the completeness of the sdss quasar selection algorithm is close to @xmath42 up to the @xmath43 band limiting survey magnitude of @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the set of agns studied here were selected from the list given by vb06 . in that study",
    ", the agns were drawn from the catalog of sdss data release three quasars described by @xcite , and from an extension to that catalog that was constructed by including objects with absolute magnitudes fainter than @xmath45 , which is the limit imposed by @xcite . from that sample ,",
    "vb06 selected @xmath46 agns for which a host galaxy spectral component could be reliably decomposed , using their eigenspectrum technique .",
    "those agns have redshifts of @xmath47 , and host galaxy fractional flux contributions , @xmath48 , of greater than @xmath49 between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the selected spectra were corrected for foreground galactic extinction using the milky way extinction curve described by @xcite , and the reddening maps provided by @xcite .",

    "each of the decomposed components ( agn and host galaxy ) must have a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath52 ) to reliably estimate the black hole masses and stellar velocity dispersions , respectively . because the @xmath10 relation applies only to the bulge component of the host galaxies",
    ", we also required that the _ reconstructed _ host galaxy components be dominated by bulge or `` early - type '' spectra .",
    "quantitatively , the following criteria were applied : 1 ) the host flux fraction @xmath48 , must be between 0.2 and 0.8 , which guarantees that the agn and host galaxy are both significant contributors to the active galaxy spectrum .",
    "2 ) the host galaxy classification angle @xmath53 , defined using the values of the first two eigencoefficients ( see vb06 and @xcite ) , must be in the range @xmath54 , which selects bulge - dominated galaxy spectra .",

    "may or may not be classified as early type .",
    "thus , this criterion does not guarantee that the host galaxy would be classified _ morphologically _ as a bulge - dominated galaxy .",

    "the selected sample galaxies are all bulge dominated .",
    "3 ) the active galaxy spectrum must have a mean @xmath52 per pixel @xmath55 , averaged over the sdss @xmath43band sensitivity function .",
    "we also required the redshifted position of the h@xmath15 line to be covered by the spectra , but that constraint was already satisfied by the @xmath47 limit in the vb06 sample . in practice",
    "the @xmath52 requirement limited the maximum redshift to be far below 0.75 .",
    "these criteria resulted in a sample of 960 spectra , with redshifts from 0.013 to 0.489 ( the median redshift is 0.153 ) and @xmath52 from 15.0 to 65.7 ( the median @xmath52 is 21.6 ) .",

    "figure[zl ] shows the agn component luminosity @xmath57 ( the monochromatic continuum luminosity at a rest wavelength of 5100 ( see  [ emwidth ] ) ) , as a function of redshift for the sample .",
    "the correlation of luminosity with redshift is due mainly to the apparent magnitude limit imposed by the sdss quasar selection algorithm .",
    "it is possible that some low redshift , extraordinarily luminous objects are missed because of the sdss upper flux limits ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "however , these should be relatively rare objects since the sdss completeness to broad - line agn is extremely high , @xmath59 ( vanden berk et al .",
    "moreover , since the relative brightness of the agn and host is one of our selection criteria ( @xmath60 ) , these most luminous objects would not be selected for our sample since the flux is dominated by nuclear light . at the other extreme",
    ", the sample certainly omits the least luminous nuclear sources , both because of the sdss faint flux limits , and because host galaxy light would dominate the flux .",
    "these objects would presumably , though not certainly , have properties that lie somewhere between those of the relatively brighter objects in our sample , and the galaxies with quiescent supermassive black holes examined in other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the bh masses were estimated by equation ( [ masseq ] ) , which requires the widths of the broad emission lines @xmath16 or fwhm , the distance of the broad emission line gas from the central gravitational source @xmath13 , and the scale factor @xmath18 .",
    "the broad emission line widths can be measured directly from the spectra .",
    "the gas radius can not be measured directly from single - epoch spectra , so we use the result based on reverberation mapping studies that the continuum luminosity and radius are strongly correlated . the radius - luminosity ( r - l ) relationship has been calibrated using the gas distances from samples of objects for which reverberation mapping techniques could be used . the power - law index for the correlation between gas radius and the optical luminosity at @xmath61 , @xmath57",
    ", was reported to be about 0.67 - 0.70 by @xcite . however , the r - l relationship can be affected by host galaxy contamination ; using new @xmath62 imaging of reverberation - mapped agns , @xcite corrected the host galaxy contamination of the optical continuum luminosity and reported a flatter power - law index of 0.52 .",
    "since our study deals with the nuclear luminosities , separated from the host stellar contribution , we adopted the r - l relationship from @xcite .",
    "the value of the scale factor @xmath18 is unknown .",
    "however , using the reanalyzed reverberation mapping bh masses of @xcite and _ assuming _ that the active galaxies obey the same @xmath10 relationship as quiescent galaxies @xcite , @xcite derived a value for @xmath18 by requiring the two techniques yield statistically consistent bh masses . in this paper",
    "we use the most recently determined mass scaling relationship from @xcite , which was calibrated by combining the r - l relationship by @xcite and the scale factor by @xcite . the mass scaling relationship for single epoch spectra , using the fwhm of the broad h@xmath15 emission line , and the monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100 , @xmath57 , is given as @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath2 is the bh mass in solar units .",
    "the zero point error in equation ( [ mbh ] ) is a formal statistical error .",
    "a more representative uncertainty in the zero point for an individual object is the intrinsic scatter about the relationship of @xmath64 dex .",
    "the measurements of the h@xmath15 fwhm and @xmath57 for our sample of agns are described in the following subsections .",
    "the 960 spectra were first decomposed into host galaxy and agn spectra using the eigenspectrum method described by vb06 .",
    "examples of the spectroscopic decomposition of the objects with different @xmath52 are shown in figs .",
    "[ decom ] , [ decom_845 ] , and [ decom_303 ] .",
    "one can also refer to fig.9 in vb06 for more decomposition examples . in each of the examples ,",
    "the original spectrum is shown along with the _ reconstructed _ agn and host galaxy spectra and the fit residuals .",
    "the _ reconstructed _ spectrum is a close match to the original active galaxy spectrum , except for some larger residuals in the regions of narrow and broad emission lines .",
    "accurately reconstructing the emission lines can require a large number of eigenspectra , which may introduce spurious features into the reconstructed continuum ( vb06 ) .    to measure the agn emission lines , we do not use the _ reconstructed _ agn spectrum , but instead use the original active galaxy spectrum with the _ reconstructed _ host spectrum subtracted . because we do not use the _ reconstructed _ agn spectrum for our analysis of the emission lines ,",
    "the imperfect modeling of the agn broad lines as seen in the residuals in fig.[decom ] does not affect the fwhm measurements of the broad lines . in subtracting the host spectrum , we are very careful in dealing with the narrow lines .",
    "after decomposing an active galaxy spectrum , the _ reconstructed _ host galaxy spectrum is interpolated across the narrow line regions , effectively removing the narrow lines .",
    "the interpolated _ reconstructed _ host spectrum is then subtracted from the original active galaxy spectrum .",
    "the resulting agn spectrum thus contains both the host and agn components of the narrow line regions .",
    "this method is better at preserving the details of the agn broad emission line profile , and it retains the noise of the original spectrum , which is necessary to assess the quality of the spectral measurements .",
    "we define the host - subtracted active galaxy spectrum as the _ decomposed _ agn spectrum .",
    "the _ decomposed _ agn spectrum should be differentiated from the _ reconstructed _ agn spectrum .",
    "as mentioned above , the _ decomposed _ agn spectrum has had the host spectrum subtracted , and it retains all of the necessary original spectrum information , such as emission lines and noise . however , the _ reconstructed _ agn spectrum is reconstructed by the eigenspectra and the eigencoefficients  this spectrum is not used for any spectroscopic measurements .",
    "figs.[coniron ] , [ coniron_845 ] , and [ coniron_303 ] show examples of _ decomposed _ agn spectra , which clearly show that the emission lines are preserved , even in the narrow line regions .",
    "the monochromatic luminosities at 5100 of the sample objects were measured from the rest frame _ decomposed _ agn spectra , by averaging over a 10.57 ( 10-pixel ) wide region centered on 5100 .",
    "the h@xmath15 profile is not always sufficiently strong in our spectra to accurately determine its fwhm .",
    "we also measured the fwhm of h@xmath21 for all objects possible because , as shown by @xcite , one can use the h@xmath21 line width to approximate the width of the h@xmath15 line when the latter is unavailable .",
    "this issue and the results are discussed further in  [ hahb ] .",
    "the widths of the emission lines were determined by fits to the line profiles in the regions near each of the lines . to fit the h@xmath21 and h@xmath15 lines , a featureless power - law continuum and feii template were first fit to the _ decomposed _ agn spectrum . the h@xmath21 and h@xmath15 lines",
    "were fitted separately .",
    "we adopted a local power law to fit the underlying continuum ; the ostensibly line - free continuum end points were selected as 4270 and 5600 for h@xmath15 lines , and as 6270 and 6980 for h@xmath21 lines .",
    "the average fluxes of the end points , averaged over the 21 pixel wide regions centered on the end points , were used to fit the power law continuum .",
    "following @xcite , an effective feii template can be generated by simply broadening and scaling the feii spectrum derived from observations of the narrow line seyfert  1 galaxy i  zw  1 ( kindly provided by t.  boroson ) .",
    "although a newer template is available @xcite , we still use the template of @xcite because one of our aims is to compare our results to those of previous studies , all of which used the @xcite template .",
    "the feii template strength is free to vary , but it is broadened to be consistent with the fwhm of h@xmath15 for each object @xcite . in order to avoid contamination from strong spectral lines , we include only the following regions in the feii fit : 4450 - 4750 and 5100 - 5350 @xcite .",
    "the best feii template is found by the minimization of the @xmath65 values in the fit region .",
    "the feii template is very weak and may be negligible in the local region of the h@xmath21 line .",
    "examples of continua and feii template fits to _ decomposed _ agn spectra in our sample are shown in figs.[coniron ] , [ coniron_845 ] , and [ coniron_303 ] .    after subtracting the continuum and iron template , the remaining broad and narrow emission features near h@xmath15 and",
    "h@xmath21 were fit with a series of gaussian profiles .",
    "the broad component of the h@xmath15 line was fit with two gaussians , which are usually sufficient to account for the width and possible asymmetry of the line @xcite .",
    "each of the [ oiii]@xmath66 lines and the narrow component of the h@xmath15 line were fit by single gaussians .",
    "the broad component of the h@xmath21 line was also fit by two gaussians , and a single gaussian was used for each of the [ nii]@xmath67 lines and the narrow component of the h@xmath68 line .",
    "the relative positions of the narrow h@xmath21 and [ nii ] lines were constrained by their laboratory values , and the relative ratio of the two [ nii ] components was fixed to 2.96 . for the h@xmath15 line fits , however , we did not set as many strict constraints as we did for h@xmath21 .",
    "instead , we allow a few  shift for each line position , and let the peaks of the [ ] doublet lines vary independently .",
    "the h@xmath15 constraints are looser than those for h@xmath21 because h@xmath15 is weaker than h@xmath21 .",
    "for example , if many restrictions are placed on the fit to the [ oiii ] doublets , the fit to the broad h@xmath15 line can become unreliable in some cases . although the peaks and fluxes of the [ ] doublet lines were allowed to vary independently , the doublet flux ratios in our sample ( fig.[oratio ] ) are close to the theoretical value of 3:1 .",
    "all of the gaussian components within either the h@xmath15 or h@xmath21 set were fit simultaneously , with the narrow - line dispersions all constrained to be smaller than 5(308.6 km s@xmath32 ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters were determined through a minimization of the @xmath65 statistic , using the non - linear levenberg - marquarrdt minimization algorithm as implemented by @xmath69 in idl . using the fitted model profiles and excluding the narrow components , we calculated the final fwhm of the h@xmath15 and h@xmath70 lines based on an analytic solution from the sum of the two fitted broad gaussian components .",
    "the sdss spectrograph wavelength dispersion ( 160 km s@xmath32 ) does not increase the broad emission line widths by any more than 1% even in the worst case .",
    "example fits to the h@xmath15 and h@xmath70 line regions are shown in fig.[fwhmfit ] , which shows the _ decomposed _ agn spectrum , the fit , the narrow and broad components of the fit , and the fit residuals .    to estimate the errors in the line width measurements",
    ", we used a method similar to that of @xcite .",
    "an artificial spectrum was generated for each object by combining the best - fit model emission lines with gaussian random errors according to the object s error array .",
    "then the artificial spectra were fit using our fitting procedure , as outlined above .",
    "each spectrum was simulated by 100 realizations ( a larger number of realizations did not significantly improve the error estimation ) , and the estimated error was simply taken to be the dispersion in the 100 measurements .",
    "the error measured in this way is the formal error , which accounts only for the random noise error in the fwhm measurement .",
    "additional uncertainties come from the uncertainty of the fitted local continuum , and imperfect removal of the feii components . assuming a single gaussian profile ,",
    "if the continuum is lowered by 10% of the line peak , the estimated fwhm will increase by 7% . if we do not remove the feii components at all , the typical measured fwhm changes by about 2% .",
    "inspection of the h@xmath15 region of the spectra showed that some of the broad h@xmath15 lines are either missing ( e.g. due to problems with that part of spectrum ) or are not detectable in the spectra . in contrast ,",
    "when h@xmath21 is in the observable spectral range ( @xmath71 ) , the broad component is almost always easily detectable .",
    "the h@xmath21 line can be used to estimate the width of the h@xmath15 line in cases where the h@xmath15 line can not be measured .",
    "we used the h@xmath15 line to estimate @xmath2 when the @xmath52 of the peak of its broad component in the _ decomposed _ agn spectrum is at least 3 .",
    "that criterion is satisfied in 640 of the 960 objects in the full sample . among the 960 objects ,",
    "the h@xmath21 line is not measurable due to bad pixels in 11 cases and because it is redshifted outside of the observed wavelength range in 17 cases . in 38 cases ,",
    "the fwhm of the h@xmath21 line is smaller than 25 ( @xmath72 ) , so that the narrow and broad components could not be unambiguously separated ; these spectra were excluded from further h@xmath21 analysis . in eight cases , the profiles of the h@xmath21 and h@xmath15 lines possess double emission profiles and extremely broad wings , making the meaning of fwhm ambiguous in these cases ; these spectra were also excluded from further analysis . in total , there are 886 spectra for which the h@xmath21 line width was reliably measured .    among the 640 good h@xmath15 and 886 good h@xmath21 spectra , there are 597 spectra for which the widths of both lines can be measured .",
    "the fwhm of h@xmath21 and h@xmath15 for these spectra are plotted in fig.[fwhmab ] ; it is clear that there is a relatively tight relationship between the two line widths , fwhm@xmath73 and fwhm@xmath74 .",
    "when fitting the relationship , neither fwhm@xmath73 nor fwhm@xmath74 can be regarded as the independent variable , so we calculate the best fit line to the logarithmic quantities using the `` bces '' ( bivariate correlated error and intrinsic scatter ) bisector estimator described by @xcite , which takes uncertainties in both parameters into account .",
    "the best fit relationship using the bces bisector estimator is @xmath75 this result is similar to that found by @xcite , and the scatter of equation([eqfwhmab ] ) is about 0.06dex ( @xmath7 470 km s@xmath32 ) . in fig.[fwhmab ] , the solid line shows the best fit , and the dashed line denotes fwhm@xmath73= fwhm@xmath74 .",
    "the filled dots are the mean spectrum fwhm from @xcite for comparison ; those points are also described well by the best fit relation .",
    "the uncertainties of the fwhm measurements for h@xmath21 and h@xmath15 and of the continuum luminosity include not only the errors from the fitting routine , but also the errors that arise in the decomposition of the agn spectrum from the original active galaxy spectrum .",
    "we estimated the total uncertainty by using simulations in the following way .",
    "for a typical object with the median @xmath52 of the sample , we simulated 100 spectra by adding random noise to the original active galaxy spectrum according to its error array .",
    "each of the 100 simulated spectra was decomposed , and the continuum luminosity and fwhm of the emission lines were fit as described above .",
    "the uncertainty in each parameter was calculated by measuring the rms dispersion of the 100 measurements .",
    "the typical rms dispersions for the fwhm measurement of h@xmath21 and h@xmath15 are 4@xmath76 and 7@xmath76 respectively ; the luminosity at 5100 has a typical dispersion of 4@xmath76 .",
    "the final uncertainty for the bh mass by equation ( [ mbh ] ) is 7@xmath76 and 14@xmath76 respectively , using the fwhm of h@xmath21 and h@xmath15 .",

    "the solid line is the distribution of @xmath57 after subtracting the host galaxy component .",
    "the dotted line shows the estimated @xmath57 values when the host galaxy component is not subtracted ; these values were estimated directly from the extinction corrected active galaxy spectrum at rest - frame 5100 , averaged over a 10-pixel wide region .",
    "it is clear that the host galaxy component is non - negligible in our sample ; the difference between the luminosity with and without host galaxy subtraction is close to 0.5 dex .",
    "this implies that the host galaxy components can significantly affect the accuracy of the bh mass estimates at the luminosities present in our sample .",

    "the estimated eddington ratio has a standard deviation of 25@xmath76 due to variations in the bolometric correction @xcite .",
    "since @xmath80 is proportional to @xmath2 , the eddington ratio would have a standard deviation of @xmath81 , assuming the typical error in our bh mass estimates (  [ bhuncertain ] ) .",
    "the solid histogram in fig.[ledd ] shows the distribution of @xmath82 ; the eddington ratios also fall within a limited range , mostly at small values .",
    "the small eddington ratios and limited range of bh masses are due to the sample selection criteria , which require that the stellar absorption features are detectable at a level that allows the host galaxy velocity dispersions to be measured .",
    "fig.[mbhledd ] shows the relationship between bh mass and the estimated eddington ratio @xmath82 . in our data sample the bh mass is inversely correlated with the eddington ratio .",
    "this is not unexpected if the range of bolometric luminosities does not change proportionally with @xmath2 .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath82 are parameters calculated from agn continuum luminosity @xmath83(5100  ) , and emission line fwhm .",
    "therefore , fig.[mbhledd ] is simply a remapping of the sample @xmath84 and fwhm values .",
    "the correlation is due in part to sample selection effects in the sdss and our sample .",
    "since our sample is selected only from sdss agn with detectable stellar features ( @xmath60 ) , the luminosity can not be above the sdss bright limit for spectroscopy ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "our sample is neither so bright that the flux is dominated by nuclear light , nor so faint that the flux is dominated by host galaxy light .",
    "thus , objects with higher bh masses tend to have a lower range of eddington ratios , and vice versa .",
    "the dispersion in the relationship is largely due to the range of measured emission line widths that are used to calculate @xmath2 .",
    "two accurate and objective methods , the _ fourier - fitting _ method and the _ direct - fitting _ method , have been developed for measuring the stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "they are all based on a comparison between broadened template spectra and the spectrum of the galaxy whose velocity dispersion is to be determined .",
    "fourier space is the natural choice to estimate the velocity dispersions because a galaxy s spectrum is a mix of stellar spectra convolved with the distribution of velocities within the galaxy .",
    "however , there are several advantages to treating the problem entirely in pixel space , rather than fourier space .",
    "specifically , the effects of noise are much more easily incorporated in the pixel - space - based direct - fitting method .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the spectrum is directly fit in pixel space .",
    "we use the public idl program @xmath85 , written by david schlegel , to find the velocity dispersions for the host galaxies .",
    "the templates consist of the first four eigenspectra from a principal component analysis of the echelle stellar spectra in the elodie database @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting dispersion value was determined by minimizing @xmath65 for the fit .",
    "the _ reconstructed _ host galaxy spectrum was not used to measure the velocity dispersion , because features such as narrow absorption line profiles may not be well reconstructed without invoking a much larger number of galaxy eigenspectra than we have used here .",
    "instead , we used the observed active galaxy spectrum after subtracting the _ reconstructed _ agn component , which we define as the _ decomposed _ host galaxy spectrum .",
    "this method allows us to use the error array of the original spectrum to determine measurement uncertainties . in the fitting routine ,",
    "all of the narrow _ emission _ lines were blocked , because there is very little information about the absorption spectrum in those regions , and the agn fit to the narrow emission lines may be poor .",
    "we also blocked the broad emission line regions of h@xmath21 and h@xmath15 to avoid any artifacts introduced by imperfectly _ reconstructed _ agn components .",
    "an example fit of a host galaxy ( from among the same objects used as examples in fig.[decom ] ) , resulting in a measurement of the velocity dispersion , is shown in fig.[vmask ] . in the figure ,",
    "the two large boxes show the masked broad h@xmath21 and h@xmath15 line regions ; the left and the right small boxes show the masked narrow emission line regions ( h@xmath86 and [ oi ] ) , and the middle small box shows the masked bad pixel region .",
    "the sdss spectra were obtained by using a fixed @xmath87 fiber , which covers different fractions of the projected areas of different objects , due both to different intrinsic galaxy sizes and different redshifts .",
    "thus , the velocity dispersions should not be compared without accounting for the finite fiber diameter , which is discussed here .",
    "the dispersion is scaled to a standard relative circular aperture , defined to be one - eighth of the effective galaxy radius .",

    "the angular sizes were scaled with distance .",
    "the correction has a maximum value of 10.8@xmath76 and a median value of 5.4@xmath76 . for a more accurate correction",
    ", the effective radii of the hosts must be measured . in the case of inactive galaxies , estimations of effective radii",
    "are publicly available parameters measured from sdss images . for active galaxies , one",

    "we have not pursued this additional correction here , owing to the limited improvements possible with sdss imaging data in relation to the required workload .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the direct - fitting method does not produce large systematic errors , but the same conclusion may not apply to our measurements given the presence of agn components . even though a measured velocity dispersion may be accurate for a _ decomposed _ host galaxy spectrum",

    "the fractional contribution of the host galaxy was set to @xmath96 .",
    "the simulated active galaxy spectra were decomposed into host galaxy and agn components , and the direct - fitting method was used to make measurements of the velocity dispersions .",

    "values of the velocity dispersions smaller than this limit are very uncertain .",

    "the low eddington ratio limit is more likely to be a selection effect , in that low - luminosity nuclei are difficult to detect in high - luminosity hosts .",
    "the apparent correlation , whether intrinsic or a selection effect , would cause at least qualitatively the same dependence of the @xmath10 relation on the eddington ratio seen in fig.[vmledd ] .",
    "figure[vmz ] shows the @xmath10 relationship for data in several different redshift bins .",
    "our sample was divided into three subgroups by redshift : @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 , shown in the figure by open triangles , filled squares , and crosses respectively .",
    "the data were separated into bins of host @xmath115 , as with the previous analysis ; each point represents data from at least 25 objects .",
    "the points clearly occupy different regions along the best fit @xmath10 line .",
    "that is due to the redshift - luminosity selection effect correlation in the sample , seen in fig.[zl ] : objects at higher redshifts have higher luminosities on average , so agns with larger host velocity dispersions and more massive black holes are preferentially selected at higher redshifts . the solid line shows the best fit to the @xmath10 relation from equation([mveq1 ] ) .",
    "figure [ vmz ] shows that the intercept of the relationship does nt change greatly with redshift .",
    "the points in the highest redshift bin are on average slightly above the best fit line , while those at lower redshifts are slightly below the line on average , suggesting a possible redshift evolution of the @xmath10 relation . with",
    "the slope fixed to the value in equation ( [ mveq1 ] ) , the intercepts of the three groups from low to high redshifts are 7.85@xmath1300.02 , 7.88@xmath1300.02 and 8.00@xmath1300.03 respectively . at face value ,",
    "the results suggest a weak but significant dependence of the @xmath10 relation on redshift , such that active galaxies on average have larger black hole masses for a given velocity dispersion at high redshift as compared to low redshift .    as with the dependence of the @xmath10 relation on eddington ratio",
    ", a partial correlation analysis was performed to determine whether the apparent redshift dependence of @xmath147 could be accounted for by correlations with other parameters .",
    "the correlation coefficient of @xmath147 with redshift , not accounting for other parameters , is 0.005 ( see last row of table  [ table3 ] ) , which is relatively small but may or may not be significant .",
    "the results of the partial correlation analysis , with @xmath57 , fwhm , @xmath6 , @xmath5 , and @xmath82 as the control variables , are shown in table  [ table5 ] .",
    "for each of the control variables , the remaining correlation between @xmath147 and redshift is relatively small .",
    "the significance of the remaining correlations are all quite high ( probabilities @xmath167 ) , except when @xmath5 is the control variable , in which case the probability of a chance correlation is about @xmath168 . however ,",
    "when controlling for all five parameters , the partial correlation coefficient is @xmath169 with a random probability of being greater of @xmath170 .",
    "thus , there is no compelling evidence for redshift evolution in the @xmath10 relation for the sample presented here .",
    "the lack of evidence for redshift evolution is in contrast to the results of several studies @xcite , that have found apparent positive correlations between the @xmath139 relation and redshift .",
    "@xcite found that their sample of seyfert galaxies at @xmath171 had larger black hole masses for a given @xmath6 , relative to the values expected from the local relation . @xcite",
    "measured co emission lines to infer @xmath6 for a set of nine high - redshift agns , and found that the host masses are undersized by more than an order of magnitude , given their bh masses .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath172 hosts in their sample are less luminous ( and therefore less massive ) than expected for a given @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite and @xcite , using o[iii ] line widths as surrogates for @xmath6 , found no evidence for redshift evolution up to @xmath173 .",
    "there is also evidence from a study of high - redshift sub - millimeter galaxies @xcite that at least some galaxies at high redshift have bh masses substantially _ smaller _ than expected for their host masses .",
    "the methods and equations used to estimate @xmath26 and @xmath0 were somewhat different in each study , and different from our own , and each sample was selected in different ways , so direct comparisons are not necessarily valid .",
    "our study is the first to examine the possibility of redshift evolution for a single , large , homogeneously collected and analyzed sample spanning both low and relatively high redshifts ; and our study is the first to determine whether an apparent dependence of the redshift evolution could be the result of correlations among other parameters .",
    "it will be important to extend the studies of the @xmath10 relation to higher redshifts , over a wide range of bh masses and velocity dispersions , using a variety of techniques .",
    "the very large and homogeneous data set analyzed here has allowed parameterization of several relations for broad - line active galaxies .",
    "host galaxy luminosity and velocity dispersion are described by the faber - jackson relation , central black hole mass is correlated with host bulge luminosity and velocity dispersion , the amplitude of the @xmath10 relation depends inversely on the eddington ratio , and there is no significant change in the @xmath10 relation with redshift up to @xmath174 .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath10 relation on both redshift and eddington ratio have been matters of dispute . in our sample",
    ", we find no significant correlation with redshift after accounting for possible correlations among many other parameters . as discussed in ",
    "[ dependence ] , there are studies that support positive , negative , and no correlation with redshift .",
    "the @xmath10 relation appears to depend on the eddington ratio , even after accounting for other parameters .",
    "apparently , the difference we have found between the high and low @xmath82 samples is sufficient to account for the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath10 relation , usually measured to be about @xmath175dex in black hole mass for a given velocity dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "*  [ results ] of this paper ) .",
    "we checked this result by dividing the @xcite sample by its median @xmath82 ; this sample shows the same qualitative trend that objects with higher eddington ratios have smaller black hole masses for a given velocity dispersion ( although the uncertainty is too great to say whether it can account for the scatter ) . as discussed in  [ dependence ] , the dependence of the @xmath10 relation on @xmath82 is probably at least partly due to selection effects  which may also affect the @xcite sample  but a significant intrinsic component can not be ruled out .",
    "there is other observational support for an anti - correlation between the @xmath10 relation and eddington ratio from observations of narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) .",
    "these active galaxies typically have relatively small measured bh masses and high accretion rates , which results in large eddington ratios .",
    "several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that nls1s tend to lie below the @xmath10 relation for inactive galaxies .",
    "if nls1s are an early stage of agn evolution , then they will presumably move up the @xmath10 plane over time ( bh masses growing ) , becoming broad - line agns and eventually inactive galaxies harboring supermassive black holes .",
    "if the objects evolve in this way toward the @xmath176 @xmath10 relation , the black holes would have to be growing more rapidly than the bulges are growing . to explain the tight relationship between the final bh and spheroid masses , the gas mass that builds the black hole",
    "may somehow be set at a given formation stage of the stellar spheroid .",
    "it would then be the fate of the black hole to grow to a particular mass , determined very early in its development by the mass of the spheroid ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "feedback from the central engine surrounding the bh may regulate the bh growth process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this feedback may have little to do with the development of the spheroid .",
    "it is also possible that nls1s are not a representative class of agn , and their evolutionary tracks in the @xmath10 plane are different than those of other types .",
    "observations of agns with luminosities comparable to nls1s , but at higher redshifts than can be obtained with the sdss , would help clarify the issue .",
    "differences in the @xmath133 relation may also be due to disk orientation effects , which could produce a wide range of incorrect estimates for black hole masses .",
    "given that all bh masses were determined by using the same value of the @xmath18 factor ( equation [ masseq ] ) , the objects with high @xmath82 may be those in which bh masses are underestimated because their true @xmath18 values are larger .",
    "@xcite argue that a flattened - disk - like geometry in the blr is favored over randomly - oriented orbits , and a flattened geometry viewed over a range of orientation angles can easily result in virial bh masses underestimated by a factor of three .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the inclination effects are actually minimal when using the line dispersions as opposed to the fwhm of the line profile .",
    "although the factor of 3 difference in the bh masses ( 0.5dex ) can explain the apparent dependence of the @xmath10 relation on @xmath82 , we can not settle this issue here because of our poor understanding of the blr geometry .",
    "our bh masses were estimated by equation ( [ mbh ] ) , where fwhm was used to characterize the line width @xcite ) .",
    "however , some studies showed that the line dispersion is a less biased parameter in general than fwhm for black hole mass estimation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the line dispersion will also minimize the effect that may be influenced by relative source inclination @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic data set has provided a large sample of homogeneously selected agn from which both nuclear and host properties can be measured . the moderate resolution and @xmath52 of the sdss spectra limit the ranges of accessible luminosities , black hole masses , and eddington ratios . however , in principle , the eigenspectrum decomposition technique can be applied to any spectrum with adequately strong nuclear and host components , so it is possible with other data sets to extend the results of this study to a larger dynamic range .",
