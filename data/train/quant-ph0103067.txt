    "in particular , quantum computation @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , certain types of quantum key distributions @xcite and quantum secret sharing protocols @xcite , are rooted in the existence of quantum entanglement .",
    "recently , lot of progress has been achieved in investigation of various properties and possible application of quantum entanglement .",
    "nevertheless , many questions are still opened . in particular , it is the problem of multi - particle entanglement @xcite .",

    "@xmath0 qubits can be prepared in entangled states of the form ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the qubits are encoded in internal ionic states as originally proposed in the model of quantum processor by cirac and zoller .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec2 ] is devoted to the description of quantum logic gates and networks .",
    "here we present multi - qubit controlled gates .",
    "we show how these gates can be expressed in terms of single - qubit and two - qubit gates , but we argue that for practical purposes it is more appropriate to utilize directly multiple - qubit gates rather than decompose them into elementary single and two - qubit gates .    in section  [ sec3 ] we present a logical network with the help of which symmetric states of the form ( [ 1.1 ] ) can be synthesized section  [ sec4 ] is devoted to a general problem of synthesis of a pure state of an arbitrary @xmath0 qubit state .",

    "we discuss the experimental realization of the proposed scheme on cold trapped ions and we also briefly address the efficiency of using multi - qubit control - not gates rather than a network of two - qubit control - not gates .",

    "we may represent a state of a qubit as a point on the bloch sphere with the parameterization @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in quantum or atomic optics the qubit is often represented by a two - level atom ( ion ) with two selected internal levels denoted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "the _ quantum logic gate _ is a quantum device which performs a unitary operation on selected ( target ) qubits conditioned by states of control qubits during a given interval of time .",
    "a gate acting on a single qubit is termed as a single - qubit gate , gates acting on more qubits are referred to as multi - qubit gates .",
    "the _ quantum logic network _ is a quantum device consisting of several quantum logic gates synchronized in time .",
    "a single - qubit gate corresponds to a unitary operator @xmath15 represented in the computational basis @xmath16 by the matrix [ 2.2 ] w= (    rr w_00 & w_01 + w_10 & w_11    ) .",
