    "propagation of electromagnetic or ultrasonic waves in billiards @xcite , compound - nucleus reactions @xcite , scattering of light in random media and transport of electrons through quantum dots @xcite share at least one feature in common : in all these situations one deals with an open wave - chaotic system studied by means of a scattering experiment , see figure  1 for an illustration . here",
    ", we have a typical transport problem where the fundamental object of interest is the scattering matrix @xmath1 , which relates linearly the amplitudes of incoming and outgoing fluxes .",
    "however , under real laboratory conditions there is a number of different sources which cause that a part of the flux gets irreversibly lost or dissolved in the environment . as a result",
    ", we encounter absorption and have to handle the @xmath1-matrix , which is no longer unitary . statistics of different scattering observables in the presence of absorption are nowadays under intensive experimental and theoretical investigations , starting from early experiments on reflection and energy correlations of the @xmath1-matrix @xcite .",
    "more recently , total cross - sections @xcite , distributions of reflection @xcite and transmission @xcite coefficients as well as that of the complete @xmath1 matrix @xcite in microwave cavities , properties of resonance widths @xcite in such systems at room temperatures , dissipation of ultrasonic energy in elastodynamic billiards @xcite , and fluctuations in microwave networks @xcite became experimentally available .",
    "theoretically , statistics of reflection , delay times and related quantities were considered first in the strong @xcite and then weak @xcite absorption limits at perfect coupling and very recently at arbitrary absorption and coupling for several symmetry classes @xcite .",
    "part of the incoming flux , where @xmath2 is the so - called transmission coefficient , is reflected back directly from the cable - cavity interface ( port ) without exciting long - lived resonances in the cavity .",
    "if the cavity is thin enough then only a transverse electric wave can propagate inside .",
    "the electric field has only a vertical component , which is uniform in vertical direction and distributed nontrivially in the plane .",
    "therefore , there is a voltage between plates as well as a current due to the in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the impedance is a quantity which relates linearly the port voltage to the port current .",
    "fluctuations of eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies result in fluctuations of the impedance or @xmath1-matrix , as the driving frequency or port position is changed.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    another insight to the same problem comes from looking at it not from the `` outside '' , but rather from the `` inside '' .",
    "then the prime object of interest turns out to be the impedance @xmath3 relating linearly voltages to currents at the system input @xcite , see figure  1 . by proper taking into account the wave nature of the current @xcite",
    "the cavity impedance can be seen as an electromagnetic analogue of wigner s reaction matrix of the scattering theory .",
    "this can be easily understood qualitatively through the well - known equivalence of the two - dimensional maxwell equations to the schrdinger equation , the role of the wave function being played by the electromagnetic field ( the voltage in our case ) .",
    "then the definition of the impedance becomes formally similar to the definition of the reaction matrix ( which relates linearly the scattering wave function to its normal derivative on the boundary ) .",
    "the impedance is , therefore , related to the local green s function of the closed cavity and fluctuates strongly due to chaotic internal dynamics .",
    "the imaginary part of the local green s function ( which is proportional to the real part of @xmath3 ) is well known as the local density of states ( ldos ) and has a long story of studies in disordered electronic systems , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "actually , a closely related quantity emerges in the context of spectra of complex atoms and molecules where it has the meaning of the total cross - section of indirect photoabsorption @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it also appears in studies on spontaneous light emission by atoms placed in chaotic cavities @xcite . as to the real part of the green s function",
    ", it seems to have no direct physical meaning in mesoscopics while it has the meaning of reactance in electromagnetics , where both real and imaginary parts are experimentally accessible .    in this review",
    "we discuss an approach developed recently by us in short communications @xcite which treats both inside and outside aspects of the problem on equal footing . in this capacity",
    "it provides a uniform and deeper understanding of various results on absorptive scattering obtained earlier in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the method allows one to study very efficiently the distribution of the local green s function ( complex impedance ) at arbitrary absorption and to relate it to that of reflection , thus linking somewhat complementary experiments @xcite and @xcite together .",
    "although calculations are most explicit and simple for fully chaotic systems , when one can rely upon the random matrix theory ( rmt ) , our method actually has relevance in a much broader context beyond rmt that involves many interesting aspects of disordered mesoscopic systems with absorption , including effects of the anderson localisation . from that point of view , the method opens an attractive possibility to look at some long - standing problems ( e.g. statistics of time delays ) from a different perspective , see @xcite as well as subsections 4.1.6 and 4.1.7 below .",
    "in this section , we provide a short description of the scattering approach to the problem .",
    "the resonance energy dependence of observables becomes explicit in the well - known hamiltonian approach to quantum scattering , which was developed first in the context of nuclear physics @xcite and can be easily adopted for models emerging in quantum chaotic scattering and mesoscopic physics , see e.g. @xcite for reviews .",
    "this framework turns out to be also most suited to take a finite absorption into account .",
    "the starting point is the following fundamental relation between the resonance part of the scattering matrix and the wigner s reaction matrix @xmath4 : @xmath5 the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath6 of the _ closed _ system gives rise to @xmath7 real energy levels ( eigenfrequencies ) .",
    "those are coupled to @xmath8 continuum channels via the @xmath9 matrix @xmath10 of coupling amplitudes @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , and as a result are converted to @xmath7 complex _",
    "resonances_. to see this , we expand ( [ s ] ) in a taylor series in @xmath4 and , after regrouping the terms , bring the resulting expression to another well known form @xmath14 for the @xmath1-matrix .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath15 emerging here characterises the _ open _ system and is the non - hermitian counterpart of @xmath6 .",
    "the factorized structure of the anti - hermitian part is necessary to ensure the unitarity of @xmath1 .",
    "the coupling amplitudes @xmath10 change very slowly with the energy ( far from the channels thresholds ) and one can safely consider them to be energy - independent . in such a resonance approximation",
    "the complex eigenvalues @xmath16 of @xmath15 , with the energies @xmath17 and escape widths @xmath18 , are the only singularities of the @xmath1 matrix in the complex energy plane .",
    "as required by causality @xcite , they are located in the lower half plane and correspond to the long - lived resonance states formed on the intermediate stage of a scattering process .",
    "the corresponding ( left and right ) eigenvectors form the so - called bi - orthogonal system .",
    "recent discussion concerning applicability of the effective hamiltonian approach to potential scattering problems ( like those with cavities ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "flux conservation requires @xmath19 to be unitary at the real values of @xmath20 .",
    "it is useful to define at real @xmath21 the following matrix @xmath22 the second equality here results from the substitution of ( [ heff ] ) and then making use of the identity @xmath23 which leads to cancellations of the cross - terms .",
    "expression ( [ romega ] ) tends to unity as @xmath24 and it is the wigner - smith time - delay matrix @xcite @xmath25 ( we put @xmath26 ) which determines the unitarity deficit of @xmath27 to the linear order @xcite : @xmath28 such a factorized representation @xcite for the time - delay matrix ( which contains no longer the energy derivative ) is a consequence of the resonance approximation considered .",
    "it serves to make a connection of time delays to the resonance spectrum most explicit",
    ". the matrix element @xmath29 may be physically interpreted as the scalar product ( or `` overlap '' ) between the internal parts @xmath30 of the scattering wave functions for waves incident in the channels @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively @xcite . in particular , the mean time delay in the channel @xmath31 given by the diagonal element @xmath33 coincides in such an approximation with the dwell time given by the norm of @xmath34 .",
    "one should distinguish generally between @xmath33 and the so - called _ proper _ time - delays @xmath35 ( eigenvalues of @xmath36 ) .",
    "taking their sum , one comes to a weighted mean time delay characteristic @xmath37 , the so - called wigner s time delay which is known , see e.g. @xcite , to be determined by the energy derivative of the total scattering phaseshift : @xmath38 .",
    "diverse aspects of delay times in quantum chaotic scattering @xcite as well as in a general quantum mechanical context @xcite can be found in the cited literature and references therein .",
    "as is well known , statistics of spectra of _ closed _ quantum systems with chaotic classical counterparts are to a large extent universal and independent of their microscopic nature .",
    "this remarkable universality provides one with a possibility to use the rmt @xcite for an adequate description of many physical properties of such systems @xcite . according to the general paradigm we replace the actual hermitian part @xmath6 of the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) with a random hermitian matrix @xmath6 taken from one of the three canonical wigner - dyson s ensembles labelled by the symmetry index @xmath39 according to the symmetry of the system under consideration .",
    "the gaussian orthogonal ( goe , @xmath40 and @xmath6 real symmetric ) and unitary ( gue , @xmath41 and @xmath6 hermitian ) ensembles stand for systems with preserved or fully broken time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) , respectively . the remaining gaussian symplectic ensemble",
    "( gse , @xmath42 and @xmath6 self - dual quaternion ) is relevant for description of time - reversal systems with strong spin - orbit scattering .",
    "the limit of large @xmath43 is supposed to be finally taken .",
    "then eigenvalues are distributed on the finite interval according to wigner s semicircle law , which determines locally the mean level spacing @xmath44 .",
    "the most appealing feature of the rmt approach is that quantities related to spectral fluctuations when expressed in units of @xmath44 ( `` unfolding '' ) do not depend on microscopic details ( i.e. the particular form of the distribution of @xmath6 or the profile of @xmath44 ) and become uniform throughout the whole spectrum @xcite . for practical reasons",
    "we thus restrict ourselves to considering fluctuations at the center of the spectrum ( @xmath45 ) only .",
    "similarly , the results turn out to be also independent of particular statistical assumptions on coupling amplitudes @xmath46 as long as @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes may be chosen as fixed @xcite or random @xcite variables and enter final expressions only in combinations known as transmission coefficients ( also sometimes called sticking probabilities ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for the average ( optical ) @xmath1 matrix .",
    "the transmission coefficients are assumed to be input parameters of the theory , the cases @xmath50 and @xmath51 corresponding to an almost closed or perfectly open channel `` c '' , respectively .",
    "absorption is usually seen as a dissipation process , which evolves exponentially in time .",
    "strictly speaking , different spectral components of the field may have different dissipation rates .",
    "however , frequently this rather weak energy dependence can easily be neglected as long as _",
    "fluctuations on much finer energy scale @xmath52 are considered . as a result , all the resonances acquire one and the same absorption width @xmath53 additionally to their escape widths @xmath54 .",
    "the dimensionless phenomenological parameter @xmath55 characterizes then the absorption strength , with @xmath56 or @xmath57 corresponding to the weak or strong absorption limit , respectively .",
    "microscopically , it can be modelled by means of a huge number of weakly open parasitic channels @xcite or by coupling to a very complicated background with almost continuous spectrum @xcite , see also @xcite . in microwave billiards",
    "such an approximation is frequently very good to account for uniform ohmic losses which happen everywhere in non - perfectly conducting walls .",
    "however , in some experimentally relevant situations as , e.g. , complex reverberant structures @xcite or even microwave cavities at room temperature @xcite an approximation of uniform absorption may break down , and one should take into account instead localized - in - space losses which will result in different broadenings of different modes .",
    "the latter are easily incorporated in the model by treating them as if induced by additional scattering channels , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "an alternative scheme of treating localised - in - space surface absorption is discussed in @xcite .",
    "( discussion of a formal theory of scattering for complex absorbing potentials can be found in @xcite . )    operationally , the _ uniform _ absorption can equivalently be taken into account by a purely imaginary shift of the scattering energy @xmath58 , so that the @xmath1-matrix @xmath59 becomes subunitary .",
    "the reflection matrix @xmath60 provides then a natural measure of the mismatch between incoming and outgoing fluxes",
    ". it can be obtained from @xmath27 , ( [ romega ] ) , by analytic continuation in @xmath21 from a real to the purely imaginary value @xmath61 , yielding @xcite : @xmath62 this representation is valid at arbitrary value of @xmath63 . in the limit of small @xmath63 one can neglect the difference between @xmath64 and @xmath36 , resulting in the approximate expression @xcite @xmath65 following from ( [ q ] ) .",
    "it is therefore tempting to keep for @xmath64 the meaning of the time - delay matrix at finite absorption as well ( see , however , discussion in @xcite ) . by construction",

    "@xmath67 are related to proper time - delays @xmath35 ( at finite absorption ) .",
    "considering quantum scattering with no internal dissipation , @xmath68 , the @xmath1-matrix unitarity ensures that the reflection coefficient @xmath69 in any given channel is simply related to the quantum mechanical probability to exit via any of the remaining channels , known as the transmission probability : @xmath70 . for an absorptive system",
    "the last equality is violated , but still the quantity @xmath71 can be interpreted as the quantum mechanical probability that a particle entering via a given channel never exits through the same channel .",
    "hence it was suggested to call @xmath72 the _ probability of no return _ ( pnr ) @xcite .",
    "in the particular case of a single open channel fluctuations of the pnr @xmath73 arise solely due to absorption ( neglecting dissipation trivially results in @xmath74 ) . at weak absorption @xmath75 , so that the pnr is just simply proportional to the time - delay .    at last but not least",

    "it is natural to think that whatever small ( but fixed ) is an absorption rate @xmath63 , in the limit @xmath340 a finite portion of the incoming flux will be absorbed in the sample and will never come back to the incident channel .",

    "the exact result for the distribution function @xmath396 of reflection eigenvalues valid for any number of arbitrary open channels and arbitrary absorption is known only for the @xmath41 case , being recently calculated by two of us @xcite , generalizing earlier perturbative results @xcite ( known for all @xmath39 ) . that uses the method developed for studying the proper time - delay distribution @xcite in the ideal lossless system .",

    "this fact makes the interpretation of @xmath315 as delay times at strong absorption questionable @xcite , since intuitively one expects a generic exponential suppression at large values of delay times @xmath399 . indeed , for the time @xmath400 a wave - packet oscillating in the cavity with a frequency @xmath401 on average experiences @xmath402 collisions with the walls , yielding the probability @xmath403 to be absorbed into one of @xmath404 parasitic channels ( @xmath405 being the transmission coefficient ) .",
    "the total reflection is then estimated as @xmath406 , giving @xmath407 in the absorption limit of the fixed absorption width @xmath408 as @xmath409 and @xmath410 .",

    "has shown that the quantum optical problem of the photon statistics can be reduced to a computation of the @xmath1 matrix of the classical wave equation .",
    "in particular , chaotic radiation may be characterized by the effective number @xmath423 degrees of freedom as follows @xcite : @xmath424 , with @xmath425 for blackbody radiation .",

    "finally , due to a duality relation @xcite of a linear amplifying system to a dual absorbing one ( related to it by inverting the sign of @xmath63 ) there exists a further link of the analysis presented here to the rapidly developing field of random lasers @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , the statistics of real and imaginary parts of diagonal elements of the green function can be very efficiently studied in the framework of the supersymmetric approach and may have various physical interpretations .",
    "the off - diagonal entries @xmath430 are of considerable importance as well .",
    "it can be easily understood that @xmath431 is essentially the wave power transmitted from a source at site @xmath208 inside a random medium to a receiver at site @xmath432 .",
    "statistics of such an object is much more difficult to study in general .",
    "presently the most studied case @xcite is @xmath41 symmetry class under an additional assumption that both receiver and source are very weakly coupled to the medium as to ensure those couplings do not contribute essentially to the resonance broadening .",

    "the distribution of the transmitted power for the case of absorptive media with preserved time - reversal invariance is not yet known .",
    "first two moments of that quantity were calculated recently in @xcite .",
    "let us finally mention that a closely related question of statistics of intensity of waves emitted from a permanently radiating source embedded in a random medium was the subject of many studies in recent years .",
    "some useful references can be found in section 7 of @xcite , see also the relevant review @xcite on random lasing .",
    "for wave scattering in open chaotic and/or disordered systems with uniform losses , we have discussed various statistics on the level of both correlation and distribution functions .",
    "the overall exponential decay due to uniform absorption is the generic feature of any correlation function reduced to a two - point spectral ( resolvent ) correlation function , that follows simply from analytic properties of the latter in the complex energy plane .",
    "for fully chaotic systems with or without trs , we have calculated exactly energy correlation functions of complex impedance and @xmath1-matrix elements at arbitrary absorption and coupling .",
    "the corresponding enhancement factors have been also discussed in detail .",
    "the result for @xmath1-matrix correlations in the case of broken trs completes the well known one @xcite of preserved trs .    to study distribution functions ,",
    "we have described the novel approach to the problem by deriving a kind of a fluctuation dissipation relation ( [ phat ] ) of quite a general nature , which relates distributions at finite absorption to arbitrary order correlations at zero absorption via a nontrivial analytic continuation procedure .",
    "correlations can be efficiently studied in the framework of the supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath0-model . in the zero dimensional case ,",
    "a number of explicit results is provided for quantities characterizing open chaotic systems both from `` inside '' ( ldos , the complex impedance and the ( local ) green s function ) and from `` outside '' ( pnrs , reflection coefficients and time delays ) .",
    "this @xmath0-model mapping provides an attractive possibility to include into consideration open disordered absorptive systems beyond the usual rmt treatment .",
    "finally , let us briefly discuss an ( incomplete ) list of problems deserving , from our personal point of view , further investigations both for scattering systems with and without absorption . within the domain of rmt applicability , the most outstanding problems are of course those requiring evaluation of four - point correlation functions of the resolvents , e.g. , partial scattering cross - sections .",
    "these are still not known even for the simplest case of broken trs .",
    "another challenge is to find a probability distribution for the multichannel @xmath1-matrix at finite absorption , thus nontrivially generalizing the poisson kernel @xcite .",
    "more work is required to understand an interplay between the statistics of complex resonances and the corresponding bi - orthogonal eigenfunctions @xcite , the question being of particular relevance for lasing from random and/or chaotic media @xcite .",
    "spatial characteristics of internal parts @xmath30 of the scattering wave function are very interesting by their own and are closely related to fluctuations in transmitted power discussed above in 4.2.3 .",
    "apart from that , last decades it was realized @xcite that it may be required to consider other symmetry classes ( beyond the three of dyson ) which are relevant , e.g. , for systems involving superconducting elements .",
    "the corresponding scattering theory is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "to reconsider many problems discussed in the present review taking those ( and other related ) symmetries into account should be both interesting and informative ( see @xcite as a recent example ) .    at last but not least : understanding scattering in disordered systems beyond the universal rmt regime , taking into account , in particular ,",
    "the effects of anderson localisation , is a rather promising area calling for more systematic research .",
    "the work was supported by epsrc grant ep / c515056/1 `` random matrices and polynomials '' ( y.v.f . ) and sfb / tr 12 der dfg ( d.v.s . and h .- j.s . ) .",
    "we start with expressing the dimensionless ldos ( the imaginary part of the local green s function @xmath446 in units of @xmath44 ) in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath6 with underlying simplectic symmetry as : @xmath447 \\frac{\\gamma}{(e - e_n)^2+\\case14\\gamma^2}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath448 , @xmath449 stand for the local amplitudes of the two eigenfunctions corresponding to the ( double - degenerate ) eigenvalue @xmath17 .",

    "in fact , in such a form the formula retains its validity for gue @xmath41 and goe @xmath40 cases as well .",
    "the problem of evaluating ensemble averages of products and ratios of characteristic polynomials of random matrices attracted a lot of research interest recently , both in physical and mathematical community . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the general problem was solved in @xcite , and the most complete set of formulae available presently for @xmath469 can be found in the recent paper by borodin and strahov @xcite . when addressing the most interesting case @xmath40 they were , unfortunately , able to consider only integer powers of characteristic polynomials , whereas ( [ f3 ] ) obviously requires knowledge of half - integer powers . in this sense",
    "the corresponding random matrix problem for @xmath40 case is still outstanding .",
    "borodin and strahov derived the following explicit expression for the @xmath42 average featuring in ( [ f3 ] ) : @xmath470 assuming that @xmath471 . here , the matrix @xmath472 has the following structure @xmath473 , with @xmath474 , @xmath475 , @xmath476 and pf stands for the corresponding pfaffian , @xmath477 .",

    "the remaining job is to find the part @xmath487 of the ldos probability density corresponding to inversion of the laplace transform in ( [ f6 ] ) , which gives @xmath488 \\times \\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi \\eta}}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\rmd t}{t } \\sinh{(2\\eta t)}\\ ] ] knowledge of this function allows immediate restoration of the corresponding probability density ( [ p(x)gse ] ) for the main scaling variable @xmath196 due to relations discussed in the main body of the present paper ( recall that @xmath489 ) .",
    "let @xmath490 be a ( self - adjoint ) hamiltonian describing a one - particle quantum motion in a d - dimensional static disordered potential . among microscopic model hamiltonians ensuring validity of the non - linear sigma - model description of such a system the simplest choice seems to be the wegner s @xmath491orbital model @xcite , or its variant due to pruisken and schfer @xcite .",
    "physically the models are equivalent to the so - called `` granulated metal '' model @xcite .",
    "one can visualize it by considering a lattice of @xmath492 sites ( @xmath493 standing for the spatial dimension of the sample ) , each site being occupied with a metallic `` granula '' .",

    "the emerging supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath0-model on the lattice is described in terms of the supermatrices @xmath509 parametrized as @xmath510 and interacting according to the `` action '' ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath511 where the first sum goes over pairs @xmath512 of nearest neighbours on the underlying lattice , @xmath44 stands for the mean level spacing and @xmath131 stands for the effective inter - granule coupling constant , which is the main control parameter of the emerging theory .",
    "we start with outlining the procedure for @xmath41 symmetry when @xmath36-matrices involved in the calculation have the smallest size @xmath513 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the granule @xmath506 does not have a channel attached to it directly , the correlation function @xmath508 , see ( [ c_omega ] ) and ( [ c ] ) , of resolvents of the ( scaled with @xmath514 ) green s functions ( [ g ] ) is expressed in terms of the @xmath36-integrals as follows @xmath515 where the supermatrix @xmath516 depends on the variables @xmath517 and sources @xmath518 via @xmath519 the `` channel factor '' @xmath520 originates from coupling to continuum , where @xmath521 if no external channels is attached to a given granule .",
