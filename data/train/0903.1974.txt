    "the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are a small group of high - energy sources that emit short ( @xmath11 s ) bursts of soft gamma - rays with peak luminosities up to 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 during sporadic periods of activity . much more rarely they emit giant flares , releasing up to 10@xmath4 ergs .",
    "sgrs are thought to be magnetars , i.e. isolated neutron stars whose persistent and bursting emission is powered by extremely high magnetic fields , @xmath510@xmath6 g @xcite . in recent years bursts similar to those of sgrs have been detected also from members of another class of sources , the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) @xcite .",

    "these simulations were carried out using mggpod @xcite , a suite of monte carlo tools developed for modelling high energy astronomy instruments . in a similar way we computed the acs effective area for the satellite orientation corresponding to the bright burst of january 25 , which was observed close to the on - axis direction ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "[ figurine ] .",
    "the properties of the brightest events are given in table  [ bursts ] .",
    "two bursts had durations longer than the spin period of  and clearly showed a modulation at 2.1 s ( see fig .",
    "[ lc2 ] ) .",
    "they occurred at 6:48:04 ut ( burst n.  149 ) and 8:17:29 ut ( burst n.  176 ) .",
    "the first burst was brighter , it started with a very bright and short initial spike ( @xmath100.3 s ) followed by a @xmath108 s long pulsating tail .",
    "about 2.5 s later a second @xmath100.9 s long burst ( burst n.150 ) was observed , whose profile is not in phase with the preceding pulses .    to estimate the energetics of these events we must assume a spectral shape , since no energy resolution is provided by the acs detectors .",
    "sgr bursts are well fit in the hard x - ray range by thermal bremsstrahlung spectra with temperatures of @xmath1020 - 40 kev .",
    "the bright burst of january 25 ( see last line of table  [ bursts ] ) was in the field of view of the ibis instrument @xcite .",
    "we could therefore analyze its 15 - 300 kev spectrum measured with the isgri detector @xcite , obtaining a bremsstrahlung temperature of kt=46 kev .",
    "we therefore adopt in the following an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath28 kev to convert the acs count rates . with this assumption ,",
    "the fluence ( 25 kev2 mev ) of the pulsed tail of burst n.  149 is @xmath10 @xmath29 erg @xmath30 . extrapolating this spectrum to lower energy , and assuming isotropic emission , we derive a total energy ( at @xmath31 kev ) in the pulsating tail of @xmath10 @xmath32 erg . note that this is a conservative estimate , since a lower temperature would result in a higher luminosity .",
    "the corresponding values for the second pulsed burst ( n.  176 ) , which was slightly shorter , are a factor @xmath10 4 smaller .",
    "the initial spike of burst n.  149 reached a peak count rate of @xmath33 counts s@xmath3 ( @xmath34 ms ) and was surpassed in intensity only by burst n.  121 that occurred about three minutes earlier . in both cases , only lower limits to the flux can be derived , due to the non - linearity of the acs response at such high count rates .",
    "the latter are reported in table  [ bursts ] , again for an assumed @xmath28 kev thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "however , it is likely that these bursts had significantly harder spectra .",
    "in fact , the initial spikes observed in giant flares from other three sgrs had spectra significantly harder than those of the pulsating tails .",
    "evidence for harder spectra was also reported in other bright bursts from  observed with konus/_wind _ on january 25 and 29 @xcite .",
    "for example , an exponentially cut - off power law with photon index @xmath35 and @xmath36 kev , results in 25 kev2 mev fluxes and fluences about 30% smaller than those reported in table  [ bursts ] .",
    "extrapolating this spectrum , gives lower limits to the peak luminosity of 6 and @xmath37 erg s@xmath3 ( @xmath38 kev ) for bursts n.  121 and n.  149 , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^ , > , > ,",
    "< \" , ]     @xmath39 in the range 25 kev2 mev , assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with @xmath28 kev .",
    "the strong activity shown by  on 2009 january 22 , with the emission of hundreds of bursts in a time span of a few hours , resembles similar episodes observed in the past from other sgrs and axps ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the peak of the bursting rate occurred around 6:48 ut , when more than 50 bursts were recorded in 10 minutes .",
    "the high fluence emitted in this short time interval is most likely responsible for the expanding dust scattering halos discovered in _ swift_/xrt x - ray images obtained about one day later @xcite .",
    "we can exclude the presence of other periods of comparably high bursting rate in the few preceding days , except for the time interval from 4:30 to 14:30 ut of january 20 , when integral was at perigee .    on january 22",
    "also emitted a few bursts remarkable for their luminosity and duration , including one ( n.  149 ) showing a bright and short spike followed by a pulsating tail .",
    "the burst was preceded by a short precursor , but , considering the high rate of bursts , it is not clear whether this was physically related to the bright burst .",
    "these features of the light curve are typical of giant flares from sgrs @xcite . therefore , despite the uncertainties due to the poorly constrained distances and possible spectral differences , it is interesting to compare the energetics of the  burst n.  149 with that of the three historical giant flares from sgrs . some properties of such events are summarized in table  2 , where also a few other peculiar bursts and flares from sgrs and axps are listed for comparison .    it is evident that the energy released in the pulsating tails of the giant flares of sgr052666 , sgr1900 + 14 , and sgr180620 was much higher than the value of a few 10@xmath0 erg we derived for  ( unless its distance is much larger than 10 kpc ) .",
    "however , the difference is mainly due to the shorter duration of the  pulsed tail .",
    "in fact the tails following the three historical giant flares lasted a few minutes , but their average luminosity ( @xmath10 @xmath4010@xmath0 erg s@xmath3 ) was not too different from that observed in the pulsating tail of  ( @xmath10 @xmath41 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "comparison of the initial spikes energetics is more difficult , since the effects of saturation and spectral uncertainties could be larger .",
    "however , also in this case , it is clear that the initial spike of burst n.  149 involved a significantly smaller energy than those of the giant flares . from the point of view of the total energy , this event was more similar to the intermediate flares or to some of the brightest bursts observed in other sgrs , such as the 1998 october 28 and the 2001 july 2 events from sgr 1900@xmath4214 , but owing to its shorter duration it reached a higher peak luminosity .",
    "another notable difference with respect to the three giant flares is that the latter had very short rise times @xcite , while the initial spike of burst n.  149 showed a slow rise to the peak , that could be resolved in 4 acs time bins ( 50 ms each ) .",
    "we note that the characteristic time - scales over which bursts develop can give information on the location of the energy source and on the mechanisms responsible for their triggering @xcite .",
    "instabilities in the magnetosphere , where the alfvn velocity is close to the speed of light , can develop on short timescales .",
    "longer timescales are expected for the release of energy stored in the neutron - star crust .",
    "the differences mentioned above suggest that burst n.  149 is not of the same nature of the giant flares .",
    "most likely this event , and the other bright bursts observed from , are just  normal \" sgr bursts with extreme properties .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that their peak fluxes and fluences are in agreement with the distributions of these quantities derived from the other bursts .     &",
