    "the introduction of a conducting surface into a region disturbs the electromagnetic field . as a general measure of the disturbance we can calculate the mode sum @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the mode frequencies before introduction of the surface @xcite and @xmath2",
    "is the resulting spectrum . for a general spectrum ,",
    "the mode sum @xmath3 is divergent for large values of the parameter @xmath4 ( for example , for a massless scalar field , it diverges as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the dimensionality ) ; however , for the electromagnetic modes disturbed by a thin perfectly conducting cylindrical shell ( of any crosssection ) , the mode sum per unit length is finite @xcite . in this case ( the subject of this paper ) the quantities of particular interest are the kac number per unit length @xmath7 ( the change in the number of possible modes @xcite ) and the casimir energy per unit length @xmath8 ( the change in the zero point energy @xcite formally calculable from the sum of @xmath9 @xcite ) .",
    "these can be extracted from @xmath10 by an expansion in powers of @xmath11 : @xmath12 from here the kac number @xmath13 can be recognized as the coefficient @xmath14 of the heat kernel expansion widely used in the casimir calculations @xcite .    for the case of a cylinder ( of any cross section )",
    "the modes have the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the continuous wave vector of the modes in the axial direction and @xmath17 are the cutoff frequencies for the modes .",
    "there are two types of modes , in which either the magnetic field or the electric field is purely transverse @xcite .",
    "the cutoff frequencies @xmath17 are determined by the solutions of the two - dimensional helmholtz problem for a scalar field representing the component of the electric or magnetic field parallel to the axis of the cylinder , with dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions for the two mode types .",
    "the mode sum ( [ modesum ] ) is over both types of modes .",
    "the sum over the cutoff frequencies ( [ modesum ] ) can be done with the aid of a contour integral representation @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 be a function that is zero for each cutoff frequency , and let @xmath19 be the corresponding function for the undisturbed space .",
    "then @xmath20 where the first integral is over a contour enclosing the real axis , and @xmath21 is the ( infinite ) length of the cylinder .",
    "the advantage to this representation is that the contour can be deformed to lie along the imaginary @xmath22 axis , where the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 are slowly varying , instead of highly oscillatory .",
    "the integral over @xmath16 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath25 .",
    "using this and making the change in variables @xmath26 gives @xmath27 in the second representation an integration by parts has been performed , and the contour integral has been converted to an integral over the @xmath28 axis .    in the cases to be considered ,",
    "the function @xmath29 $ ] can be taken to be an even function of @xmath28 .",
    "then we can replace @xmath30 by its even part , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the bessel function of order @xmath25 ) , and reduce the range of integration to the positive @xmath28 axis , arriving at the representation @xmath33    the quantity @xmath29 $ ] becomes small for large @xmath28 .",
    "in general the leading term is of order @xmath34 ; this determines the kac number per unit length , as will now be shown .",
    "define @xmath35 and separate eq.([contour3 ] ) into two terms : @xmath36 the first integral converges and is equal to unity , independent of the cutoff @xmath4 .",
    "the second integral is convergent without the bessel function , so that we may take the limit @xmath37 in the integrand .",
    "then according to eq.([kacnumber ] ) , the casimir energy per unit length is @xmath38",
    "the kac number for an arbitrarily shaped conductive shell has been given previously @xcite .",
    "the casimir energy of the circular cylindrical shell has been also determined @xcite . here",
    "we will give a new route to the known result in the familiar setting of the circular cylinder , in preparation for the extension to the case of the cylinder of elliptical cross section .",
    "we consider the effect on the electromagnetic spectrum of the introduction of a cylindrical conducting boundary of radius @xmath39 into another cylinder of radius @xmath40 ( which will be taken to infinity shortly @xcite ) .",
    "the cutoff frequencies of the system interior to the larger cylinder are specified by a scalar function @xmath41 , which satisfies the two - dimensional helmholtz equation .",
    "the variables can be separated , so that @xmath42 is a combination of angular factors @xmath43 and bessel functions of corresponding order .",
    "there are both @xmath44 and @xmath45 modes , for the regions @xmath46 and @xmath47 , so that there are four mode conditions : @xmath48 ; @xmath49 ; @xmath50 ; and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the hankel function of order @xmath25 ) .",
    "then a candidate for @xmath53 is the product for all @xmath25 of the left - hand sides of these four expressions , and @xmath54 is the product of the factors @xmath55 .",
    "however , for @xmath56 , the bessel functions are increasing or decreasing exponentially , and in the limit of large @xmath40 the exponentially small @xmath57 terms can be dropped so that @xmath58 reduces to a product of modified bessel functions @xmath59 the factor @xmath60 has been introduced so that the factors in the product approach unity for large @xmath28 . this product can be written in a simpler form with the aid of the wronskian relation @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63    there is an alternate route to ( [ cylinder1 ] ) that sheds some light on its meaning @xcite .",
    "the path integral representation of quantum mechanics turns three - dimensional quantum mechanics at zero temperature into a four - dimensional classical statistical mechanics problem where the ratio @xmath64 that determines the boltzmann weight at a temperature @xmath65 is represented by the ratio of the action to planck s constant .",
    "the introduction of a boundary suppresses @xmath45 modes ( because the longitudinal electric field must vanish at the boundary ) but introduces new @xmath44 modes ( because the longitudinal magnetic field can be discontinuous across the boundary ) . in either case the effect is localized near the boundary , and can be described by solutions of the modified helmholtz equation @xmath66 with sources on the boundary .",
    "these solutions have radial parts that are described by the modified bessel functions , and the amplitudes of the sources are proportional to @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70  the quantities that enter into ( [ cylinder1 ] ) .",
    "this approach gives a route to the calculation of the casimir energy entirely in terms of functions defined on the imaginary @xmath22 axis .",
    "combining ( [ casmir ] ) and ( [ cylinder2 ] ) gives @xmath71 the logarithm can be expanded in a sum of powers of @xmath72 .",
    "then @xmath73 , where @xmath74      klich @xcite has pointed out a useful trick for evaluating the sums that appear in these equations . the green function for the modified helmholtz problem can be expanded in modified bessel functions about an arbitrary origin , and by equating representations we can derive the identity @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 performing the operation @xmath77 on both sides of ( [ green ] ) gives @xmath78 by multiplying this expression times itself @xmath79 times , identifying the @xmath80 in a chain of pairs , and integrating over all @xmath80 we may derive a series of identities @xcite @xmath81 substituting these into ( [ cylinderexpansion ] ) gives an extension of the representation for @xmath82 similar to that given by balian and duplantier @xcite .      for large @xmath28 the @xmath72 , eq.([sigmadefinition ] ) ,",
    "are small , and eq.([kacdef ] ) gives @xmath83 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for large @xmath28 , this integral is dominated by the contribution from small @xmath84 , so that we may replace @xmath85 by its argument , leading to @xcite @xmath86 this result was given previously by balian and duplantier @xcite .",
    "they also showed that with this choice @xmath87 in ( [ cylinderexpansion ] ) vanishes .",
    "we evaluated the expressions for @xmath88 ( [ cylinderexpansion ] ) by a monte carlo integration .",
    "the first step is to change variables to @xmath89 , which compresses the range of integration to the interval @xmath90 $ ] ( the choice of the fourth power is somewhat arbitrary , but was found to give better sampling of the function in the monte carlo integration ) .",
    "then the multiple integral over the angles and @xmath91 is given by the average of the integrand ( in the new variable ) evaluated at uniformly and randomly sampled values for @xmath91 and the @xmath80 .",
    "averaging over @xmath92 configurations we find @xmath93 for large @xmath94 the integral is almost entirely due to the terms involving @xmath95 : @xmath96 this series @xmath97 is found to fall off as @xmath98 rather accurately , and it is also possible to evaluate the sum of the series in the form @xmath99 therefore only the first few @xmath88 need to be calculated ; we thus arrive at the evaluation @xmath100 in agreement with the accepted value @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo program is simple in structure and only requires modest computational resources .",
    "the accuracy is limited by the @xmath102 term , which is difficult to evaluate because the integrand has significant contributions from large @xmath28 when the four angles @xmath80 are nearly the same .",
    "elliptical coordinates are related to the rectangular coordinates @xmath103 by @xmath104 the surfaces of constant @xmath105 are confocal ellipses with axes @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the distance between the foci is @xmath108 ; the eccentricity of the ellipse is @xmath109 .",
    "the case of the circle is recovered in the limit @xmath110 , @xmath111 ( which implies @xmath112 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional modified helmholtz equation can be separated in these variables .",
    "the solutions have the form of products @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 satisfy the mathieu equations @xmath116 @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the separation constant . the functions @xmath119 play a role similar to that of the trigonometric functions in the case of the cylinder , and become them in the circle limit .",
    "the condition that @xmath119 be periodic restricts @xmath118 to a discrete set of values , but unlike the case of the circle the allowed values are not integers and depend on @xmath28 ; we will refer to the set of these as @xmath120 , where @xmath25 is a counting label ( the modes can be ordered so that @xmath121 , and so that @xmath122 is the nodeless function of @xmath123 ) . for any @xmath28 , the corresponding set of functions @xmath124 forms a complete set for expression of a general function of @xmath123",
    "; they will be normalized so that for any @xmath118 and @xmath125 in @xmath126 , @xmath127 then it follows from the completeness of the @xmath128 that @xmath129    the function @xmath130 plays a role analogous to a modified bessel function ; there are again two solutions : @xmath131 , which is regular at small @xmath105 ( and increasing ) ; and @xmath132 , which is small at large @xmath105 ( and decreasing ) .",
    "these are related by the wronskian relationship @xmath133 however , there are some important differences from the case of the circular cylinder .",
    "eq.([de - xi ] ) differs from the bessel equation in that there is no term in the first derivative .",
    "this implies that the wronskian is constant , and we are choosing the normalization so that it is unity , as stated in ( [ mathieuwronskian ] ) .",
    "this also means that the product of the two solutions is asymptotically unity at @xmath105 large , and ( via eq.([de - xi ] ) ) at @xmath28 large as well .",
    "additionally the bessel functions depend on radial position @xmath134 only through the @xmath135 combination , and on what happens in the angular sector only through the order @xmath25 , while the mathieu function @xmath130 depends on @xmath28 , @xmath105 , and @xmath118 separately .",
    "we can make the mathematics of the ellipse look more like the mathematics of the circle if we define the restricted functions @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "for real cutoff frequency @xmath22 we can similarly define the oscillatory functions @xmath138 and @xmath139 that correspond to the usual bessel functions .",
    "the cutoff frequencies for the elliptical cylinder whose shape and size are determined by @xmath140 and @xmath105 are determined by the values of @xmath22 for which either @xmath141 or @xmath142 for the modes inside the cylinder and with a similar but more complicated relationship for the modes outside the cylinder .",
    "the quantity @xmath143 needed for the contour integral relationship ( [ contour ] ) for the mode sum is constructed from these elements as in the circular cylinder case .",
    "after the change of variables @xmath26 , we arrive at @xmath144 where we have used the wronskian relationship ( [ mathieuwronskian ] ) in the second line .",
    "the cautious reader will have reason to be suspicious about the analytic continuation of @xmath145 to @xmath146 . in the case of the circular cylinder",
    "the order @xmath25 of the bessel function is an integer and unaffected by the frequency ( its argument @xmath22 ) ; here , the @xmath147 depend on the frequency , and take on different values on the real and imaginary axes . for complex values of @xmath28 , the @xmath148 are surely also complex .",
    "however , the point is that the mathieu function @xmath149 is analytic in @xmath28 for any choice of @xmath105 and @xmath118 , and then the restricted function @xmath146 is also analytic ; the way that the set @xmath147 evolves as @xmath28 is varied is built into the definition of the restricted functions .",
    "finally , we will note that the path integral approach @xcite gives an alternate route to the representation ( [ ellipse1 ] ) .    with this foundation ,",
    "the determination of the kac number and the casimir energy for the cylinder of elliptic cross section is similar to that for the circular cylinder .",
    "in particular , eqs .",
    "( [ kacdef])-([casmir ] ) , ( [ casimircylinder ] ) , and ( [ cylinderexpansion ] ) are unaltered , except that the sums are now over the set @xmath150 .      in elliptic variables the green function satisfies the partial differential equation @xmath151 we can represent it in two ways : by direct transcription from the polar variables @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the distance between the points @xmath154 and @xmath155 ; or as an expansion in mathieu functions @xmath156 for @xmath157 ( and with @xmath105 and @xmath158 interchanged for @xmath159 ) . the coefficients @xmath160 are determined by the conditions that @xmath161 and @xmath162 be continuous at @xmath163 ( for @xmath164 ) , and that the singularity at @xmath165 has the amplitude implied by ( [ pde ] ) .",
    "the result of this analysis is that @xmath166 for all @xmath25 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus we have the identity @xmath167    we only need this result for the case @xmath168 , where @xmath153 reduces to @xmath169 where @xmath170    take the @xmath105 derivative of ( [ identity ] ) to get @xmath171 thus by defining @xmath172 we obtain an identity equivalent to ( [ klichidentities ] ) . in the circular case",
    "( large @xmath105 ) , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , so that ( [ gdef2 ] ) reduces to ( [ gdef ] ) with @xmath106 . for the circular case ,",
    "the klich expansion was a convenience that improved the rate of convergence by summing over all orders of the bessel functions . in the elliptical case",
    "it is even more useful , because it allows us to do the sums equivalent to ( [ cylinderexpansion ] ) without constructing the sets @xmath150 or the mathieu functions .",
    "reprising the argument given above , the kac number per unit length determines the leading contribution to @xmath175 $ ] at large @xmath28 .",
    "the analogue to eq .",
    "( [ cylk ] ) is @xmath176 where we have changed variables to @xmath177 and @xmath178 . as was previously explained , for large @xmath28 we can replace @xmath85 by @xmath84 ; then the integral over @xmath84 is the same as was considered in eqs.([cylk ] ) and ( [ cylk2 ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath179 which can be evaluated in terms of the complete elliptic integrals ( @xmath180 are the axes of the ellipse ) .",
    "this agrees from the general expression given by balian and duplantier @xcite . in the limit of small @xmath181 , this expression is of order @xmath182 .",
    "therefore in figure 1 we plot @xmath183 , which is independent of the size of the cylinder and only weakly dependent on its shape .",
    "the horizontal axis is the eccentricity @xmath184 .    for large eccentricity",
    ", the cylindrical shell is approximately a pair of planar strips of width @xmath39 and area @xmath185 separated by a distance @xmath181 .",
    "then its kac number must be proportional to the area ( @xmath186 ) while the kac number per unit area can only depend on the strip separation @xmath181 . since the kac number itself is dimensionless",
    ", the combination of these two arguments predicts a dependence @xmath187 thus explaining the divergence of the kac number at large eccentricity .      the term @xmath188 in eq.([cylinderexpansion ] ) again vanishes for the case of the cylinder of elliptical cross - section : substituting ( [ gdef2 ] ) and ( [ klichidentities ] ) into ( [ cylinderexpansion ] ) and then changing variables from @xmath189 to @xmath190 and @xmath84 leads to an integral that differs from the circular case only by a scale factor .",
    "the expansion ( [ cylinderexpansion ] ) continues to be relevant , as does ( [ klichidentities ] ) , except that now @xmath191 is given by ( [ gdef2 ] ) .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ cylinderexpansion ] ) that all of the @xmath88 are negative , and thus that the casimir energy is negative .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the @xmath88 can be done as above , using almost the same program .     on @xmath94 .",
    "the curves are drawn for @xmath192 and @xmath193 , in ascending order .",
    "the nearly constant slope of these lines indicates that @xmath194 is decreasing as @xmath195 . ]",
    "figure 2 shows that it is again true that @xmath194 decreases as @xmath195 , so that the series sum converges .",
    "we evaluated @xmath196 through @xmath197 by monte carlo integration , and applied a truncation correction based on the @xmath195 law .",
    "the resulting dependence of @xmath8 on the eccentricity @xmath198 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "also shown in figure 3 is @xmath199 .",
    "the lack of dependence on @xmath198 for small @xmath198 agrees with the results of kitson and romeo @xcite , who discussed the casimir energy of a cylinder of elliptical cross - section perturbatively .",
    "as was already observed , for large eccentricity the cylindrical shell is approximately a pair of planar strips of width @xmath39 separated by a distance @xmath181 .",
    "the casimir attraction between these would give an energy @xmath200 @xcite ( @xmath185 is the area of a strip ) ; this can be rewritten in terms of the eccentricity as @xmath201 .",
    "the dash - dotted line in figure 2 shows that this crude argument successfully accounts for the divergence of the casimir energy at large eccentricity .    ; this removes the divergence at large eccentricity .",
    "the dashed line is @xmath202 , which removes the leading order dependence on @xmath198 for small @xmath198 . ]",
    "the case of a cylindrical shell with circular cross - section holds a special place in the physics of the casimir effect . at zero temperature casimir forces",
    "are known to be attractive for parallel plates @xcite , repulsive for the sphere @xcite and nearly zero ( very weakly attractive ) for a long cylindrical shell @xcite .",
    "thus the latter is approximately the intermediate case .",
    "the solution of the elliptical cross - section case allows us to follow the evolution of the casimir attraction with eccentricity @xmath198 as the shell cross - section evolves from circular to highly eccentric , resembling the parallel plate geometry .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the casimir energy is found to decrease with eccentricity with the circular case corresponding to the energy maximum .",
    "naively one might have expected that the casimir attraction in the @xmath203 limit would be stronger than its parallel plate counterpart @xcite .",
    "our results indicate the opposite , however : even though both attractions have the same order of magnitude , the parallel plate geometry generates stronger attraction .",
    "this illustrates the non - additive character of the casimir forces .",
    "since the interactions are attractive with the circular cross - section corresponding to the energy maximum and the large eccentricity @xmath204 limit being the minimum , with only casimir stresses present a fixed area shell would be unstable with respect to collapse onto itself .",
    "we argue that this remains the equilibrium state of the system at arbitrary temperature .",
    "indeed the high - temperature thermodynamics of the system is dominated by the kac number as the latter determines the form of the free energy @xcite @xmath205 at a temperature @xmath206 where @xmath207 is a length scale approximately corresponding to the largest eigenfrequency of the problem . for @xmath208 , as is the case in the problem under study , the equilibrium configuration of the shell must have the largest kac number @xmath13 .",
    "but we found ( figure 1 ) that the kac number diverges in the large eccentricity @xmath204 limit which corresponds to the collapsed state .",
    "however , as this limit is approached we have @xmath209 , thus inevitably leaving the range of applicability of the high - temperature expression ( [ fenergy ] ) and entering the range of applicability of the zero - temperature theory where the ground state is still collapsed .",
    "this allows us to argue that the equilibrium state of fixed area shell in the presence of casimir stresses only is collapsed at arbitrary temperature .",
