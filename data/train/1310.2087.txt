    "recent observations have found multiple  planet systems whose architectures differ strikingly from that of our solar system .",
    "one of the most distinctive features is a lack of companion planets in hj systems ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . although some exceptions are being brought out by the _",
    "survey , this trend is clearly seen in recent observational results .",
    "several ideas for the inhibition of planet formation in the vicinity of hjs were presented ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we propose a new way of explaining this observational property .",
    "the combination of radial velocity and transit detection observations provides information on the average densities of planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which shows that a significant fraction of hjs are gaseous giant planets .",
    "this clearly means that hjs are surrounded by gaseous components in protoplanetary disks , at least during their formation stages .",
    "a natural question in this regard is what happened in the protoplanetary disks in the presence of hjs",
    ". it might be interesting to theoretically probe the condition of planet formation in the presence gaseous giants .",
    "we investigate the formation of terrestrial planets in the presence of an hj .",
    "for the origin of hjs , although type ii migration ( e.g. , @xcite ) and tidal circularization of high  eccentricity planets ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) were proposed , we here introduce a hybrid scenario in which hjs can be formed through gravitational instability prior to growth of terrestrial planets @xcite .",
    "recent progress in our understanding of protostar formation provides an explanation regarding the formation of protoplanetary disks and their accretion onto the central protostar in their early evolutionary phases ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "one of the findings from high  resolution numerical simulations that describe the gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores indicates that new  born protoplanetary disks are gravitationally unstable and produce multiple planetary mass objects that tend to chaotically migrate in the massive disks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the final fates of those planetary mass objects are not entirely clear , the objects that were formed relatively late may survive and remain as gaseous giants in various locations in the disks .",
    "therefore it is natural to consider the planet formation process under the influence of gaseous giants in protoplanetary disks .",
    "the letter proceeds as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , we describe our numerical model ; in section  [ sec : results ] , we present the results of simulations . in section  [ sec : condition ] , we derive the condition for migration of hj . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we present a discussion .",
    "an hj with jovian mass is initially placed at @xmath0 on a circular orbit , where @xmath1 is the semimajor axis of the hj . under the influence of the hj , formation of solid planets from planetary embryos are investigated using numerical simulations that combine the _ n_body code and the semianalytical code .",
    "the simulation domain of _ n_body calculations is set between 0.02 and 0.5 au and the gravitational forces between all the bodies are calculated ( in the same manner as in previous works by @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for the initial solid disk , the solid surface density is assumed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a scaling factor and @xmath4 is the radial distance from the central star . according to this density distribution , planetary embryos",
    "are placed with the isolation mass of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the width of the feeding zone and assumed to be @xmath7 hill radii .",
    "note that protoplanets reach the isolation masses for the parameters we are concerned with , unless significant loss of surface density caused by collisional fragmentation occurs @xcite .",
    "the effect of type i migration is considered ; thus , protoplanets migrate in to the simulation domain from beyond 0.5 au .",
    "we also simulate the growth and migration of protoplanets beyond 0.5 au not by _ n_body code but by semianalytical code in the same manner as in the population synthesis model ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where protoplanets migrate after their growing .",
    "when protoplanets reach the boundary @xmath8 , the bodies are added to the _ n_body code .",
    "we incorporate the effects of eccentricity and inclination damping and orbital migration due to gravitational interaction with the gas disk ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the decay rate of semimajor axis is @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the type i migration efficiency factor @xcite and the gas surface density gradient ( @xmath12 ) , respectively .",
    "the migration can be halted when the planets are captured in a mean motion resonance with the hj ( e.g. , @xcite ) or they reach a region with positive density gradient .",
    "the latter corresponds to locations on the disk inner edge ( e.g. , magnetospheric cavity ) or the outer edge of a gap that is opened by the hj ; terrestrial planets in these locations can gain a positive torque from the disk by the steep surface density gradient @xcite .",
    "planets stop their migration at density gaps or resonance locations , whichever are first encountered by the planets ( i.e. , whichever is at the more distant location from the star ) .",
    "the unperturbed gas surface density is considered to be of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a scaling factor @xcite .",
    "we usually assume @xmath15 in our simulations .",
    "for the case of @xmath16 , the solar metallicity is considered .",
    "note that there is a vast range in the metallicity of stars ; we vary the values of @xmath3 and/or @xmath14 in order to change the metallicity .",
    "the gas disk exponentially dissipates on the depletion timescale of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the orbital period at 0.1 au .",
    "the unperturbed gas surface density profile is shown by the dashed line in figure  [ fig : model](a ) .",
    "we consider a disk inner edge , @xmath19 , at 0.05 au from the central star and inside of which there is a cavity .",
    "the hj opens up a gap near its orbit ; for gap profile computations we use an analytical description developed by @xcite , which depends on the disk viscosity . in this study , relatively high value for the turbulent viscosity",
    "is assumed @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the disk viscosity .",
    "we will discuss the dependence of the disk viscosity in the following paper ( ogihara et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . the gas surface density profile , which includes the density gap , is shown by the solid line in figure  [ fig : model](a ) . at the gap edge , @xmath22 becomes smaller than @xmath23 , which cause a positive torque on the planet .",
    "the location of @xmath24 for the gap edge @xmath25 is shown by the dotted line in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "the location of the 2:1 resonance with the hj is shown by the dot  dashed line , which is further from the central star than the gap assuming @xmath0 .",
    "when the hj comes very close to the central star @xmath26 , the locations of the 2:1 resonance and the gap edge move inside @xmath19 ( figure  [ fig : model](b ) ) .    if hjs move to very close  in orbits , the tidal interaction with the star",
    "would be important .",
    "the migration timescale induced by the tidal torque is @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the tidal dissipation function and the love number of the central star , respectively . assuming @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the timescale is reduced to @xmath32 which is a strong function of @xmath33 .",
    "we also incorporate this damping in our simulations , adopting a slightly smaller valuer of @xmath34 to reduce the computational cost , which does not change our conclusions for @xmath35 .",
    "note that if hjs reach 0.02 au , they can fall onto the star within several @xmath36 yr even assuming conservative values of @xmath37 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we set the inner boundary of the computational region at 0.02 au .",
    "in figure  [ fig : t_a](a ) , we show the time evolution of semimajor axis for our fiducial model parameters , where @xmath38 is assumed .",
    "the time unit is expressed by the orbital period at 0.1 au ( lower axis ) and by yr ( upper axis ) .",
    "all bodies are plotted as filled circles connected with solid lines , whereas the hj is represented by open circles .",
    "the dotted line represents the location of @xmath39 ; the inner disk profile is determined by the gap opened by the hj @xmath40 , whereas it is determined by the inner cavity in the late stage of the simulation .",
    "planetary embryos that are initially placed inside 0.5 au undergo inward migration .",
    "the innermost planet stops its migration when it is captured into the 2:1 mean motion resonance with the hj at @xmath41 .",
    "other migrating protoplanets approach the inner planet , which is captured in the 2:1 resonance , and interact with each other , leading to mergers or captures into mean motion resonances . as a result",
    ", several planets relax to a quasi  steady state captured in mutual mean motion resonances , which is called a chain of resonant planets or a `` resonant chain . ''    after that , several planetary embryos whose growth is calculated using the semianalytical code migrate inward from outside 0.5 au . and @xmath42 , which can be attributed to the fact that the growth of protoplanets inside 0.5 au is not simulated in this work .",
    "note , however , that this produces no systematic change in the final state of planetary architecture , which is confirmed by high  resolution simulations ( ogihara et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "] these protoplanets also interact with the planets in the resonant chain , and eventually participate in the resonant chain .",
    "because the innermost planet is located outside the gap edge , the planets in the resonant chain reside in the region of negative density gradient in the gas disk and keep losing the orbital angular momentum by the negative type i migration torque . through gravitational interaction between the hj and the planets in the resonant chain ,",
    "the hj migrate inward by being pushed in by the resonant chain as a whole , although the hj itself is in the cavity of the gas disk .",
    "we call this phenomenon a `` crowding out '' effect .",
    "note that the crowding out may also occur due to the interaction between an hj and a massive swarm of planetesimals feeling strong aerodynamical gas drag ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "when the hj comes to a very close  in orbit @xmath43 , the location of the 2:1 resonance with the hj is comparable to the location of the disk inner edge at 0.05 au ( figure  [ fig : model](b ) ) .",
    "the innermost planet in the resonant chain reaches the disk inner edge and gains the positive torque from the disk , which compensates for the net negative torque exerted on the planets in the resonant chain ; the inward migration of the hj due to the crowding  out effect is halted at @xmath44 . is closer to the star than that assumed in this letter",
    ", the hj migrates inside 0.03 au due to the crowding out . ]    the disk gas is depleted on the timescale of @xmath45 .",
    "then , only the hj moves inward because of the tidal torque from the host star , which results in widening separation between the hj and the innermost planet",
    ". this leads to a deviation from the 2:1 resonance , and subsequently some planets exhibit orbit crossing . in this run ,",
    "two giant impact events between planets are observed at @xmath46 , which results in losses of commensurate relationships .",
    "the hj is lost to the central star . ] , and two terrestrial planets remain at the end of simulation .",
    "the largest planet has @xmath47 .",
    "figures  [ fig : t_a](b ) and ( c ) show the results with decreased @xmath48 and increased @xmath49 solid surface density , respectively .",
    "although the hj gravitationally interacts with the resonant chain , the inward migration of the hj caused by the crowding out is not seen in the result of decreased solid density @xmath48 because small planets formed in the less massive disk , feeling weak type i migration torques , can not effectively reduce the angular momentum of the hj through resonant interactions .",
    "the largest planet has a mass of @xmath50 at the end of simulation .",
    "the migration of the hj due to the tidal torque from the star is also not observed because the hj has a larger semimajor axis @xmath51 .",
    "several planets have commensurate relations in the final state . on the other hand ,",
    "the crowding out of the hj is clearly observed in the result of increased density @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , the timescale of inward migration of the hj is shortened .",
    "relatively large planets with maximum mass of @xmath52 remain in the final state .",
    "we now derive the condition for inward migration of the hj due to the crowding out within the disk lifetime . when the hj moves close to the central star , it can subsequently be lost to the star because of the tidal evolution .",
    "therefore , the condition for crowding out can simply corresponds to the condition for the loss of hj .",
    "the timescale of the hj s induced migration due to the crowding  out effect , @xmath53 , which depends on the total mass in planets in the resonant chain @xmath54 and on the migration timescale of planets in the chain @xmath55 , is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are , respectively , the angular momentum of the hj and the total migration torque exerted on the planets in the resonant chain . @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the typical values for the semimajor axis and the migration timescale of the planets in the resonant chain .    assuming that all the bodies that migrate to near 0.1 au are included in the resonant chain , we derive the total mass of the migrating planets @xmath61 . because the type i migration speed increases with increasing mass , bodies grow to a certain mass and then start migration",
    "the mass of migrating planets is expressed by the critical mass for migration , which is determined by a balance between the accretion timescale and the migration timescale , or the isolation mass , whichever is smaller .",
    "the isolation mass is smaller in the inner region ; thus , we can define a boundary @xmath62 , inside which all the migrating planets are with the isolation mass .",
    "the total mass of the migrating planets is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the radius of the inner edge of the initial solid disk , and @xmath65 denotes the maximum semimajor axis , inside which solid bodies can start migration before the disk gas is depleted .",
    "we assume @xmath66 for simplicity . when input parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath10 , and @xmath14 ) are specified , a unique value for @xmath65 is determined .",
    "we first consider the case where planets with the isolation mass can only migrate inward ; the condition for @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 where @xmath30 and @xmath69 are assumed hereafter . then the maximum semimajor axis @xmath65 is deduced by equating the migration timescale @xmath70 with the disk depletion timescale @xmath71 . substituting @xmath65 into equation  ( [ eq : m_chain ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath72 note that this should be overestimated by about a factor of 25 because the integral in equation  ( [ eq : m_chain ] ) is performed from the central star for simplicity .",
    "then the migration timescale of the hj is approximated by @xmath73 where a correction factor @xmath74 is introduced .",
    "in addition to the overestimate of @xmath61 , the gas density profile also accounts for this correction .",
    "although we adopt equation  ( [ eq : surface_gas ] ) and derive the migration timescale , both @xmath75 and @xmath22 become smaller around @xmath76 .",
    "we put all of these corrections into the factor @xmath74 .",
    "when the planets migrate inward from the outer region where the mass is determined by the critical mass for migration @xmath77 , the total mass in the resonant chain is estimated by @xmath78 note again that this is somewhat overestimated .",
    "the migration timescale of the hj is given by @xmath79 where @xmath74 is the correction factor as mentioned above . by comparing this expression with the actual migration timescale observed in simulations ,",
    "we find @xmath80 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : condition ] , we plot the condition for migration @xmath81 due to the crowding out on the @xmath82 plane for @xmath83 ( gray  hatched region ) and 0.01 ( dark  hatched region ) . figure  [ fig : condition](a ) is the case where the full type i migration rate is considered @xmath84 , whereas figure  [ fig : condition](b ) shows the condition for @xmath85 .",
    "we find that the parametric region in which the crowding out is effective is not so limited ; in fact , the effect becomes rather common when the gas or solid surface densities are larger than the minimum mass solar nebular model ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the condition for crowding out is not expected to depend on the metallicity @xmath87 .",
    "there is a correlation between the stellar metallicity and the probability of an hj ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which can be explained if hjs are more likely to form around high  metallicity stars .",
    "the origin of the lack of companion planets close to hjs can be naturally explained using our model .",
    "when the crowding out of hj is effective ( e.g. , the disk mass @xmath88 is large ) , the hj can be pushed inward by a chain of resonant planets , leading to a collision with the central star .",
    "therefore , the hj is never observed , whereas other terrestrial planets remain around 0.1 au . on the other hand , when the crowding out is not effective ( e.g. , in a low  mass disk ) , the hj and companion planets may coexist . however , their masses and/or sizes are below the detection limit of the current survey . in both cases , systems with the hj and close  in terrestrial planets have little chance to be detected .",
    "our model provides a theoretical prediction for future observations .",
    "that is , if additional planets will be found just outside the hj , the masses of planets are likely to be small . in those systems , the maximum mass for solid planets can be estimated by equating @xmath89 and @xmath71 as @xmath90 in addition , if many exoplanets that contradict our prediction are detected , it means that some of the assumptions made in our model should be invalid .",
    "one possibility is that the inner edge of the gaseous disk is much larger than our choice at the formation stage of terrestrial planets , which makes the crowding out inefficient .",
    "whatever observational results we obtain , the implications of our results may impose some constraints on the planet formation theory .",
