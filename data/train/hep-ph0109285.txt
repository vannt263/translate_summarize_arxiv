    "one can thus parameterize the six - point function in the vicinity of the pole as @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the bound state wave - function .",
    "substituting this parameterization into the dyson equation ( [ g_dyson ] ) and identifying the residuum contributions on both sides , one obtains the homogeneous bound state equation , @xmath16 despite the simple appearance of the bound state equation in this symbolic form , its direct solution is not feasible . even in principle , this could only be attempted once a model interaction is specified to fix the contributions to the kernel @xmath9 which can in general never be fully determined from first principles .",
    "the approximation scheme we present below essentially consists of two steps .",

    "the equation for the @xmath204 baryon is solved by an algorithm completely analogous to the one presented here .",
    "the results for two characteristic parameter sets are given in table  [ pars ] .",
    "although the wave and the vertex function are no physical observables they do enter observable matrix elements ( see _ e.g. _ refs.@xcite ) and therefore the strengths of the single components give a hint on their effect on observables . we have plotted the leading chebyshev moments of the scalar functions describing the nucleon @xmath205 waves in figure [ s_wfig ] .",
    "these are @xmath206 and @xmath207 , describing the @xmath205 waves for scalar and axialvector diquark and @xmath208 that is connected with the virtual time component of the latter .",
    "we see for both sets that the functions @xmath209 are suppressed by a factor of @xmath210 compared to the dominating @xmath206 .",
    "the strength of the other @xmath205 wave associated with the axialvector diquark is roughly proportional to the ratio @xmath211 for the respective parameter set .    in figure [ i ]",
    "we have plotted the @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 chebychev moments ( the odd ones have been left out for clarity of the presentation ) of the linear combinations of the functions @xmath215 and @xmath216 which belong to the eigenfunctions to the ( 3 quark ) spin operator and the operator of angular momentum between quark and diquark @xcite .",
    "one sees easily that in the nucleon rest frame higher chebychev moments become unimportant very fast .",
    "in summary , we have succeeded in developing an efficient algorithm for the calculation of the nucleon amplitudes in the seperable approximation to the poincar covariant three - quark faddeev equation . to this end",
    "we employ an approximate @xmath118 symmetry of the resulting effective diquark - quark bethe ",
    "salpeter equation by using a chebychev expansion .",
    "this allows to transform the full 4-dimensional problem into a manageable form .",
    "the chosen expansion in dirac space into partial waves has been done covariantly and the results for the partial wave strengths identify the leading and subleading components .",
    "the chebyshev expansion for the scalar functions which describe the partial wave strengths has proved to be quite efficient and accurate , furthermore the expansion has been done for a lorentz invariant variable , with the consequence that the boost of the wave and vertex function solutions is rendered feasible .",
    "the latter point is of utter importance because the applications of the presented results to calculate physical observables require to lorentz boost the bethe ",
    "salpeter wave function .",
    "please note also that in lorentz frames where the nucleon is moving higher chebychev moments will become increasingly important with increasing nucleon momentum . nevertheless , based on the presented algorithm nucleon form factors",
    "have been calculated up to several gev of transfered momentum @xcite , and even production processes have been studied for a similar energy range @xcite .",
    "given the fact that the required cpu time to run this program is very moderate even on pcs , and that the underlying poincar invariant nucleon model has a much broader application range than non - relativistic models we are confident that the presented model and the related algorithm will find wide - spread use in future investigations of nucleon properties .",
    "before the main program we have included a * module global * to provide a global definition of the input parameters . furthermore , the integration points and weights are defined globally .",
    "the main program calls the subroutine * read_parameters * , allocates memory space for the used fields , and calls then the subroutine * int_weights * three times determining thereby the integration points and weights for the one angle and the one momentum integration .",
    "note that the momenta @xmath217 $ ] are mapped to the interval [ 0,1 ] for a gauss  legendre quadrature of the momentum integration .",
    "the subroutine * dqnorms * is called to calculate @xmath40 and @xmath41 as prescribed by eqs .",
    "( [ normsc],[normax ] ) .    then the iteration loop for the nucleon mass",
    "is started with two initial values for the bound state mass @xmath11 . during each iteration",
    "step the main algorithm , given in the subroutine * bsemain * is called which calculates the vertex function , the wave function and the coupling @xmath218 which corresponds to the mass @xmath11 .",
    "the mass is updated by bisection until satisfactory agreement between @xmath219 and the scalar diquark normalization is reached .",
    "calling the subroutine * output * concludes the main program .",
    "reading the input and writing out the vertex function , the wave function and the coupling @xmath40is defered to the subroutines * read_parameters * and * output*. the format in which the parameters are read in and the results are written out is obvious from the appended sample input and sample output .      the first action to be taken in the subroutine *",
    "bsemain * is to call the subroutine * bse_kernel * to generate the kernel of the equation as given in eq .",
    "( [ kern_final ] ) .",
    "this includes the integration over @xmath220 and the summation over the zeros of the chebychev polynomials . a complex auxiliary array @xmath205 is introduced whose real part , denoted @xmath221 ,",
    "is then used to provide the explicit expression for the kernel .",
    "next , the propagator matrix @xmath222 is generated , via the intermediary steps of specifying the numerator of the matrix @xmath169 and the application of eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) .",
    "then the chebychev moments @xmath188 are initialized , all by the same function @xmath223 .",
    "the iteration is implemented by a do while loop . in the iteration loop ,",
    "first the chebychev expansion of the propagators ( denominators and numerators ) and in a subsequent step the one of the product of quark and diquark propagators is determined .",
    "this allows to calculate the functions @xmath189 , _",
    "i.e. _ the wave function @xmath108 , from eq.([bse1 ] ) . finally , eq .  ( [ bse ] ) with the calculated kernel",
    "is used to update the vertex function @xmath113 ( the @xmath188 ) . the new function @xmath224 is used as described in sect .  3 to update @xmath40 and to test for convergence .",
    "the subroutine * int_weights * calculates the integration points and weights for gauss  legendre quadrature",
    ".    the recursive function * chebyone * determines the values of the chebychev polynomials of the first kind .    the function * dq * implements the diquark function ( [ v ] ) .",
    "of course , trivial tests establishing the independence of the number of integration points etc .  have been performed .",
    "we also verified that the vertex and wave functions are independent of the initializing functions .    in table",
    "[ conv ] we demonstrate the convergence of the bound state mass in terms of @xmath225 and @xmath130 .",
    "we have chosen parameter set i from table [ pars ] for that purpose . since in the scalar diquark channel",
    "the binding energy is just 46 mev , one might not expect good convergence due to the nearby poles in quark and diquark propagators . nevertheless , already for @xmath226 and @xmath227 the nucleon mass is exact up to 0.1 mev .",
    ".convergence of the bound state mass @xmath11 [ gev ] in terms of @xmath225 and @xmath130 . due to weaker convergence of the wave function ,",
    "only @xmath228 is considered . for momentum and angular integration @xmath229 grid points",
    "have been used .",
