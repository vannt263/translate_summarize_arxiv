    "the success of narrow - band searches , focusing on ly@xmath0 , was predicted by partridge & peebles ( 1967 ) nearly 40 years ago , but early surveys failed to produce anything other than upper limits .",
    "the unexpected faintness of the objects caused it to take almost three decades before the narrow - band technique was successfully used to identify the first high redshift ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies ( mller & warren 1993 ; hu & mcmahon 1996 ) , and it is only recently , with the advent of 8 m class telescopes and sensitive detectors , that larger samples of ly@xmath0 selected objects have been reported ( steidel et al . 2000 ; malhotra & rhoads 2002 ; fynbo et al .",
    "2003 ; venemans et al . 2005 ) . lately ,",
    "much of the attention has been turned to detecting ly@xmath0-emitters in the redshift range of @xmath5 , and the lower redshifts have been neglected . due to the increase in luminosity distance ,",
    "objects at these redshifts are very difficult to study in greater detail , once they are found . at lower redshifts ( i.e. @xmath6 )",
    ", it is still possible to detect , or at least put strong upper limits on , the sed of the galaxy .",
    "hence at these redshifts , we can study the nature of ly@xmath0 selected galaxies , using public multi - wavelength surveys .",
    "however , ly@xmath0 also appears to be an excellent tool in finding very high redshift sources ( e.g. iye et al .",
    "2006 ) and so it is also of interest to push the limits of what is observable . we can then use the strength of wide - field narrow - band imaging for ly@xmath0 to find very high redshift sources ( @xmath7 ) , which in turn will enable a study of when re - ionisation happened and how galaxies formed .    in these proceedings , we present our on - going survey strategy to study the nature of ly@xmath0-emitters at lower redshifts , and present a future public survey that we expect will find several very high redshift sources .",
    "magnitudes are in the ab system .      in order to understand the physical nature of any high redshift galaxy , multi - wavelength coverage enabling",
    "sed fitting analysis is crucial .",
    "hence recent large surveys , such as the goods fields ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) and the cosmos survey are invaluable .",
    "these are the fields we target in our narrow - band surveys .",
    "we have nearly completed a survey at redshift @xmath8 in the goods - s field ( nilsson et al .",
    "2006 ; nilsson et al .",
    "2007 , to be submitted ) .",
    "the narrow - band imaging we have in this field comes from the vlt / fors instrument , with a field - of - view of @xmath9 . in this field",
    "we have found 23 candidate compact ly@xmath0-emitting candidates , and one so - called ly@xmath0-blob . we have also started a similar survey in the goods - n field , using the nordic optical telescope ( not ) on la palma , canary islands , spain .",
    "this survey is focused on two redshifts , @xmath10  and  3.15 .",
    "the data shows 10 candidates in the lower redshift filter .",
    "the higher redshift filter imaging is not complete .",
    "finally , we are proposing a public survey with the vista telescope ; elvis - emission line galaxies with vista .",
    "this survey will be conducted with a narrow - band filter centred on ly@xmath0 at @xmath4 , see section  [ nil : sec3 ]",
    "in december 2002 , one @xmath9 field , centred on ra  @xmath11 and dec  @xmath12 ( j2000 ) was observed with vlt / fors1 .",
    "the field was observed for 8.3 hours in a narrow - band filter with central wavelength 5055   and with a fwhm of 60   .",
    "this corresponds to a redshift range of @xmath13 for ly@xmath0 .",
    "the images were reduced and calibrated with standard methods ( see nilsson et al .",
    "2007 , to be submitted , for details ) .",
    "the 5@xmath14 limiting magnitude for the narrow - band image is 25.8 .",
    "we selected objects using the hst / acs f435w and f606w images available from goods and using sextractor .",
    "the narrow - band image was used as a detection image , and broad - band magnitudes were measured in circular apertures placed at the position of the narrow - band sources on rebinned hst images .",
    "objects with a measured equivalent width larger than zero and `` signal - to - noise '' of the equivalent width measurement larger than three were selected .",
    "our final catalog includes 26 objects , of which three are associated with the ly@xmath0-blob ( sec .",
    "[ nil : sec2:1 ] ; nilsson et al .",
    "2006 ) and the other 23 are compact ly@xmath0-emitting candidates which will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( nilsson et al .",
    "2007 , to be submitted ) .      in the narrow - band image",
    ", we found a so - called ly@xmath0-blob , similar to what has been found by many authors before ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "2000 ; matsuda et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the blob has a size of approximately 70  kpc in projected diameter and a total ly@xmath0 line luminosity of @xmath15  erg  s@xmath16 .",
    "a contour - plot , as well as a plot of the blob surface brightness and the spectrum can be found in figure  [ nil : fig1 ] .",
    "the total multi - wavelength data on the blob can be seen in figure  [ nil : fig2 ] .",
    "there have been three proposed energy sources of blobs .",
    "these are _",
    "i ) _ hidden qsos ( haiman & rees 2001 ; weidinger et al .",
    "2005 ) , _ ii ) _ star formation and superwinds from ( possibly obscured ) starburst galaxies ( taniguchi et al .",
    "2001 ; ohyama et al .",
    "2003 ) , and _",
    "iii ) _ so - called cold accretion ( haiman , spaans & quataert 2000 ; fardal et al .",
    "2001 ; sommer - larsen 2005 ; dijkstra et al .",
    "2006a , b ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ) .",
    "cooling flows are phenomena observed in galaxy clusters for more than a decade .",
    "these are explained by gas which is cooling much faster than the hubble time through x - ray emission in the centres of the clusters .",
    "however , cooling emission from a galaxy , or a group sized halo can be dominated by ly@xmath0 emission , so - called cold accretion . until the discovery of our goods - s blob , cold accretion had not been observed .",
    "because of the extensive multi - wavelength coverage of our blob , we were able to conclude that it is powered by cold accretion .",
    "the argument that the goods - s blob is powered by cold accretion comes from ruling out the other two options .",
    "as seen in the thumb - nail images in figure  [ nil : fig2 ] , there are no detected continuum counterparts to the blob ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "a starburst galaxy would have been observed in the deep optical or ir data we have , and an agn would have been detected in the x - rays or the ir .",
    "even an obscured agn should be observed with the _ spitzer / mips _ bands .",
    "there were two objects of particular interest to us ; object  # 3 and object  # 6 in the contour - plot of figure  [ nil : fig1 ] .",
    "object  # 3 since it appeared to have some faint ly@xmath0-emission surrounding it , and had a photometric redshift similar to the blob ( @xmath17 ) , and object  # 6 since it only appeared in the _ spitzer _ bands .",
    "object  # 3 does appear to have some narrow - band flux with very low significance ( @xmath18 ) and so we studied the uv properties of this galaxy .",
    "however , the measured uv flux of this galaxy is not sufficient to photo - ionise the blob .",
    "we considered that object  # 6 was a hidden agn , but its ir colours are more indicative of a higher redshift starburst galaxy .",
    "after ruling out the possibility that the blob was powered by star formation , or agn activity , we hence concluded that this blob must be the first observation of cold accretion of neutral gas onto a dark matter halo . for a more extensive discussion of this blob ,",
    "see nilsson et al .",
    "ly@xmath0-emitters is one of the most promising methods of finding very high redshift ( @xmath19 ) galaxies . to date , the galaxy with highest redshift known ( @xmath2 , iye et al .",
    "2006 ) was found as a ly@xmath0-emitter through narrow - band imaging techniques . hence , there are now many proposed projects to find @xmath20 ly@xmath0-emitters .",
    "one such project is a public survey with the vista telescope .",
    "vista is a new telescope being built near paranal in chile .",
    "it is a 4-m telescope , with a wide - field ir camera array .",
    "it is equipped with the standard set of broad - band filters , as well as a custom - made narrow - band filter with central wavelength 1185  nm and fwhm  @xmath21  nm purchased by the dark cosmology centre ( dk ) .",
    "vista will devote 85  % of its time for public surveys and will be run by eso .",
    "the public survey we propose is called elvis  emission line galaxies with vista survey ( nilsson et al . 2007 , in prep .",
    ") , now part of a larger survey called ultra - vista , which proposes to do both very deep broad- and narrow - band imaging .",
    "the elvis part of the proposal , the deep narrow - band imaging , is planned to go to a depth of @xmath22  erg  @xmath23  s@xmath16 ( 5@xmath14 ) in an 0.9  square degree field .",
    "the science case is to find a large sample of emission - line galaxies at several redshifts .",
    "the observations will be sensitive to h@xmath0 at redshift @xmath24 , [ oiii ] and h@xmath25 at @xmath26 , [ oii ] at @xmath27 and ly@xmath0 at redshift @xmath4 .",
    "for the ly@xmath0-emitters , a prediction of the number counts of objects found can be seen in figure  [ nil : fig3 ] .",
    "we expect to detect approximately 15 such objects in our survey .",
    "these ly@xmath0-emitters can then be used to study the re - ionisation state of the universe at this redshift , and to study clustering , as seen in figure  [ nil : fig3 ] .",
    "all of the emission lines surveyed with elvis are also good star formation rate indicators .",
    "thus , the survey will enable a detailed study of the star formation history of the universe . for h@xmath0 , the survey will reach more than three orders of magnitude below l * and",
    "so elvis will probe the very faint end of the h@xmath0 luminosity function at @xmath24 .",
    "to summarise , we have an extensive survey plan underway to determine the nature of ly@xmath0-emitters at redshifts @xmath28 , using public , multi - wavelength data in surveys such as goods and cosmos .",
    "we do this by e.g. sed fitting analysis and morphological analysis from hst data . in our goods -",
    "s survey , we discovered a so - called ly@xmath0-blob .",
    "its properties are best explained by cold accretion onto a dark matter halo .",
    "this in turn means that the energy sources of these blobs are diverse , since previous authors have found that other blobs have been better explained by star formation ( steidel et al .",
    "2000 ; francis et al .",
    "2001 ; matsuda et al . 2004 ; palunas et al . 2004 ) or agn activity ( fynbo et al . 1999 ; keel et al . 1999 ; dey et al . 2005 ; villar - martin et al . 2005 ; weidinger et al . 2005 ) .",
    "larger samples of this rare phenomenon are required before we can fully understand the underlying processes in these objects .",
    "finally , we have also presented our future public survey ( elvis ) , planned to start observing in the winter of 2008 .",
    "it is expected to discover tens of ly@xmath0-emitters at @xmath4 , as well as hundreds of intermediate redshift emission - line galaxies and thousands of h@xmath0-emitters at lower redshift .",
