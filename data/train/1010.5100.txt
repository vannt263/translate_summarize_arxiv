    "studies of statistical mechanics in two dimensions @xcite have been strongly stimulated recently by the discovery of graphene @xcite , the first truly two - dimensional crystal and the simplest possible membrane .",
    "experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite demonstrations of intrinsic ripples on graphene due to thermal bending fluctuations have initiated numerous works on the effect of the ripples on the electronic properties of graphene @xcite due to coupling between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "this coupling originates from several factors , such as the dependence of electron hopping parameters on interatomic distances and on the angles between chemical bonds as well as from the redistribution of electron density in a deformed membrane ( see for review refs . ) .    however , graphene is just the first representative of a huge class of two - dimensional crystals including broad - gap semiconductors such as hexagonal boron nitride @xcite , graphane ( hydrogenated graphene ) @xcite and fluorographene @xcite .",
    "electrons in such materials are just conventional nonrelativistic quantum particles and not chiral dirac fermions like in graphene , and one can not expect there manifestations of exotic effects of corrugations such as gauge fields @xcite . at the same time , another interesting physics specific of the two - dimensional case arises which will be the subject of the present work .    it is known since many years that the interaction of a charge carrier in a semiconductor with some order - parameter fluctuations can drastically change its state leading to self - trapping , or autolocalization @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is of crucial importance , for example , for the phase separation in magnetic semiconductors and colossal magnetoresistance materials @xcite , where the magnetization plays the role of order parameter . since the band motion of the electron is easier ( and , hence , the bandwidth is larger ) for a ferromagnetically ordered state the electron in antiferromagnetic or magnetically disordered surroundings creates a ferromagnetic region and turns out to be self - trapped in this region ( different names are used for this state , such as spin polaron @xcite , ferron @xcite , or fluctuon @xcite ) .",
    "if concentration of electrons is large enough it leads to a formation of ferromagnetic state in the whole crystal , via so called double exchange , otherwise the phase separation happens , all electrons being trapped in the ferromagnetic regions .",
    "the crucial mechanism is the dependence of electron hopping parameter on the angle between magnetic moment on neighboring sites @xcite .",
    "importantly , the critical point where fluctuations of the order parameter are the strongest is the most favorable for these `` fluctuon '' effects @xcite .",
    "since the hopping parameter in a fluctuating membrane depends on the angle between normals @xcite one can expect a similar physics .",
    "if the electron motion is the easiest in the flat membrane , self trapping in an anomalously flat region is possible , in the opposite case an anomalously crumpled region can arise . since membranes are characterized by very strong bending fluctuations and very slow , power - law decay of the corresponding correlation functions @xcite the situation is formally similar to that for autolocalization in the critical point in three - dimensional systems .",
    "i will study here this autolocalized state which can be called `` flexuron '' , by analogy with `` ferron '' , or `` fluctuon '' .",
    "technically , i will use the path integral approach @xcite as was applied to the fluctuon problem in our previous works @xcite .",
    "this method is an adaptation of the seminal work by feynman on the theory of polaron @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the flexuron forms in crystalline membranes at a large enough coupling constant and its size is of the order of the length scale where interactions between bending and stretching modes become important . the number of electron states in the fluctuation tail of the electron density of states where all states are ( auto)localized , even without extrinsic disorder , turns out to be proportional to the temperature .",
    "in the continuum medium theory @xcite the membrane is described by the out - of - plane - deformation field @xmath0 .",
    "the unit normal vector at a given point is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the two - dimensional gradient . in the ground state ,",
    "the membrane is supposed to be flat , and all normals are along @xmath3 direction ( fig .",
    "1a ) . at finite temperatures , the membrane is fluctuating , and the normals are no more parallel ( fig .",
    "let us assume , for simplicity , that the electron spectrum is isotropic near the band minimum .",
    "then , by symmetry , the shift of the band edge due to bending fluctuations should be proportional to @xmath4 and the electron hamiltonian takes the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the effective mass , and @xmath8 is the coupling constant , of the order of the electron bandwidth . it can be both positive or negative , as a result of the interplay of different contributions . if the band is narrowed under crumpling , @xmath9 ; the edge of the spectrum in this case corresponds to a homogeneous state with @xmath10 , the energy of this state is @xmath11 .",
    "we will start from the case of positive @xmath8 ; for negative @xmath8 the hamiltonian ( [ hamm ] ) should be modified , to bound the ground - state energy from below .",
    "this case will be considered later , in section 4 .    in the mean - field approximation , at finite temperatures the band edge",
    "is shifted up by @xmath12 the inclusion of fluctuations , however , changes this conclusion dramatically .",
    "for the case of spin polarons , it was demonstrated already by brinkman and rice @xcite that the band _ edges _ do not depend on the degree of spin disorder .",
    "the band is narrowed in antiferromagnetic or magnetically disordered state in comparison with the ferromagnetic one but not due to the shift of the band edges , just the density of states ( dos ) becomes larger at the middle of the band and exponentially small near the edges , similar to the so called lifshitz tails @xcite in disordered systems .",
    "one can expect the same behavior for our case ( fig .",
    "the mean - field energy ( [ shift ] ) is , rather , an inflection point of dos ; the states between @xmath13 and @xmath11 are associated with rare events , namely , correlated fluctuations such that in some large areas the membrane is flat and normals are parallel .",
    "the tail of the dos below @xmath14 is associated with flexurons .",
    "the autolocalization region becomes larger when the energy goes closer to the band edge @xmath11 ( and the edge itself corresponds to the completely flat state of the whole membrane , cf .",
    "refs . ) .    in crystalline membranes ,",
    "the anharmonic effects are essential , namely , the coupling between bending and stretching modes ; without this coupling the membrane turns out to be crumpled at any finite temperatures @xcite . in the harmonic approximation which is valid for not too small wavevectors",
    "@xmath15 of fluctuations , the fourier component of the normal - normal correlation function @xmath16 at temperature @xmath17 is given by the expression @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the bending rigidity .",
    "the use of this expression to calculate @xmath20 leads to a logarithmically divergent result .",
    "the point is that the expression ( [ harm ] ) is not applicable for small enough @xmath21 where the anharmonic effects become dominant .",
    "the coupling between the bending and the stretching phonons in crystalline membranes leads to the renormalization of the bending rigidity and its growth with @xmath21 decrease .",
    "perturbation analysis shows that the anharmonic effects become dominant at @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the young modulus ( `` ginzburg criterion '' @xcite ) . for smaller @xmath21 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is of",
    "the order of inverse interatomic distance and @xmath26 is the exponent of the renormalized bending rigidity . within the self - consistent screening approximation @xcite @xmath27 .",
    "recent monte carlo simulations @xcite and functional renormalization group analysis @xcite give @xmath28    the factor @xmath29 can be found from the matching of expressions ( [ harm ] ) and ( [ anharm ] ) at @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a numerical factor .    with logarithmic accuracy ,",
    "one finds @xmath33 where @xmath34 originates from the cutoff at small @xmath21 and we assume @xmath35 ( for example , for graphene @xmath36 @xcite ) .",
    "thus , within the mean - field approximation , the shift of the band edge is proportional to temperature .",
    "physically this effect is observable ( i.e. not hidden by thermal smearing ) if @xmath37 that is , @xmath38 .",
    "further we will assume that this condition is fulfilled , e.g. , due to a large logarithm .",
    "to take into account the effect of fluctuations on the electron energy spectrum i will use the path integral formalism @xcite , following refs ..    the partition function of the whole system ( the electron plus the fluctuating field @xmath39 ) is represented as    @xmath40 \\right\\rangle _ { f }   \\label{partfun}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the inverse temperature , @xmath42 is the hamiltonian ( [ hamm ] ) , @xmath43 is the partition function of the field , @xmath44 is the corresponding hamiltonian , @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the average over the field states . using the feynman path - integral approach @xcite and taking average over @xmath39 yields for the electron - only free energy @xmath47 , \\label{freen}\\ ] ] where the effective action of electron is @xmath48 = \\mathcal{s}_0\\left [ \\mathbf{r}\\left ( \\tau \\right ) \\right ] + \\mathcal{s}_{int}\\left [ \\mathbf{r}\\left ( \\tau \\right ) \\right ] \\label{s1}\\ ] ] and @xmath49 = \\frac 12\\int\\limits_0^\\beta \\left ( \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{d\\tau } \\right ) ^2d\\tau ,    \\label{s2}\\ ] ] @xmath50 \\right ) = \\left\\langle \\exp \\left [ -g\\int\\limits_0^\\beta \\varphi \\left [ \\mathbf{r}% \\left ( \\tau \\right ) \\right ] d\\tau \\right ] \\right\\rangle_f \\label{s3}\\ ] ] ( we put temporarily @xmath51 ) .",
    "the average can be formally written as a cumulant expansion @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the @xmath7-th cumulant correlators , defined recursively by @xmath54etc .    to estimate the electron free energy @xmath55 we use the same trial action as in refs.ourtmf1,ourjmmm,ak1 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 ^{2}d\\tau d\\sigma ,   \\label{tract}\\]]the oscillator frequency @xmath58 being trial parameter ( in contrast with ref .",

    "that this approximation is in reasonable agreement with the results of monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "we will use it here . substituting eqs.([harm ] ) and ( [ anharm ] ) into eq.([wick ] ) one finds @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a numerical factor .",
    "let us start estimating eq.([f ] ) in the gaussian approximation , that is , taking into account only terms with @xmath77 , then @xmath78 now we have to minimize the right - hand - side of eq.([gauss ] ) to find the size of flexuron @xmath79 and the autolocalization energy .",
    "let us assume first that @xmath80 .",
    "in this case one can rewrite eq.([gauss ] ) as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and we have restored the missing constants @xmath83 and @xmath7 .",
    "the last two terms in the right - hand - side of eq.([gauss1 ] ) are proportional to temperature .",
    "the minimum of this function exists if @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) which is a criterion of autolocalization in this approximation .",
    "of course it is valid only with an accuracy of some numerical factor since we kept only leading logarithms in our estimations .",
    "it is hardly to expect that @xmath86 is _ much _",
    "larger than one , thus , an optimal value of @xmath87 is of the order of unity , beyond the formal limit of the approximation ( [ gauss1 ] ) .",
    "the analysis from the opposite limit , @xmath88 gives the same result which is not surprising keeping in mind that the expressions ( [ cc ] ) match at @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , @xmath90 this is the main result of our consideration , and it is amazingly simple : the size of the self - trapping region is of the order of @xmath91 ( which is much larger than the interatomic distance , so the continuum medium description works ) .",
    "thus , inhomogeneities induced by electrons in fluctuating membrane should have the same spatial scale as the crossover length from the harmonic to the anharmonic regime .",
    "the higher - order terms in the cumulant expansion in eq.([f ] ) can be estimated from the expressions in the harmonic regime .",
    "each next couple of the green functions @xmath92 gives an additional factor @xmath93 , together with additional integration over @xmath15 ( which can affect the powers of logarithms ) and , importantly , the additional small parameter @xmath94 , which is only partially compensated by the additional factor @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the cumulant expansion has a small parameter @xmath96 and the results of the gaussian approximation are reliable .",
    "a compact analytical expression for the density of states @xmath97 can be obtained for the lifshitz tail regime , that is , very close to the true edge of the spectrum @xmath11 . to this aim",
    ", one can use the method of ref .. for the range of energies @xmath98 , relevant flat regions have a size much larger than @xmath91 , thus , we are in the strongly anharmonic region . from scaling considerations @xcite , one can postulate that for all @xmath7 , as well as for @xmath99 ( cf .",
    "eq.([cc ] ) ) , @xmath100 further consideration just repeats that of ref . for the case of xy - model .",
    "the result for the lifshitz tail of the density of states is @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) . of course , probing experimentally the states with energies much smaller than the temperature is not an easy task , so the expression ( [ tail ] ) is mainly of formal interest .",
    "the number of electron states within the tail between @xmath11 and @xmath13 can be estimated by a diagrammatic approach suggested in ref .",
    ", section 4.3 . by analogy with eq.(152 ) of that work , one can estimate the electron concentration per atom as @xmath103",
    "consider now the case of a negative coupling constant which physically means that corrugations result in a gain of electron energy .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamm ] ) can not be used here since its spectrum is not bounded from below .",
    "instead we will use the hamiltonian @xmath104 where @xmath8 is still positive and @xmath105 is the value of @xmath106 optimal for electron hopping ; the coupling constant is now @xmath107 , and @xmath11 is still the lowest possible energy . using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation ,",

    "thus , the effective coupling constant for the fluctuation contributions is just equal to @xmath120 .",
    "all the conclusions of the previous section about the size of flexuron and criterion of autolocalization remain valid .",
    "the mean - field expression for the shift of the band edge is now different . as follows directly from eq.([hamm1 ] ) @xmath121",
    "we have shown that the electron can be self - trapped by bending fluctuations assuming that the parameter @xmath122 , eq.([nu ] ) is large enough .",
    "one can expect @xmath8 to be of the order of the electron bandwidth @xmath70 ( cf .",
    "the discussions for graphene reviewed in ref . ) . for the young modulus",
    "a natural estimation is @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a cohesive energy and @xmath125 is a lattice constant .",
    "for covalently bonded membranes ( such as graphene or h - bn ) @xmath126 .",
    "this means that the effective mass should be of the order of the free electron mass , and therefore it is hardly to expect the formation of flexuron for , e.g. , gapped graphene with a mass @xmath127 . on the other hand",
    ", the criterion of autolocalization should be easy to fulfill for a soft membrane with @xmath128 .",
    "assuming that we are in the regime of the autolocalization , the electron injection into crystalline membranes at finite temperatures does not result in the conductivity , the states will be ( auto)localized , even without external disorder .",
    "this will be the case till the whole fluctuation tail will be occupied .",
    "the number of the states in the fluctuation tail is given by eq.([cap ] ) , so the transition to the conducting states happens at @xmath129 .",
    "the higher the temperature the more electrons should be injected .",
    "strictly speaking , the flexuron states are completely localized only if one assumes that the fluctuations are static . in an ideal system ,",
    "the flexuron can move together with the anomalously corrugated region , but very slowly , for typical phonon times ( cf .",
    "the discussion for the case of fluctuon @xcite ) .",
    "one can expect , however , that even very weak extrinsic disorder will localize so slow particle .    if the flexuron forms , its size is of the order of @xmath130 where @xmath131 ( [ ginzb ] ) is a crossover point from harmonic to anharmonic regime , so , the bending fluctuations are stabilized by electrons just at the border of the strong anharmonicity .",
    "a very interesting issue for future studies is the case of finite electron ( flexuron ) concentrations . by analogy with magnetic semiconductors",
    ", one can expect a tendency to the phase separation and electron droplet formation @xcite .",
    "electronic mechanisms of stabilization of corrugations were discussed in a context of graphene @xcite but in a broad - gap semiconductors considered here physics should be essentially different .",
    "probably , the flexuron formation is a proper term in this case .",
