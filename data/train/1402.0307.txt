    "in recent years , there has been much interest in atom interferometry for high - precision inertial measurements @xcite , as well as measurements of the fine structure constant @xcite , and potentially gravitational wave detection @xcite .",
    "although thermal sources of atoms currently have a larger flux , bose - einstein condensates have an advantage over thermal atoms as they have a narrower velocity distribution and larger coherence length , allowing for easier manipulation of the motional state and increased visibility @xcite .",
    "however , in any interferometer that utilises uncorrelated particles , our ability to estimate an applied phase shift @xmath0 is limited by the standard quantum limit ( sql ) , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the total number of detected particles @xcite .",
    "there has recently been much interest in the use of spin squeezed states of ultra - cold atoms , as it enables atom interferometry with sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite .",
    "spin squeezing via one - axis twisting @xcite has previously been demonstrated in two - component becs @xcite .",
    "the rate at which spin - squeezing occurs is governed by the parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass of the atom , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the population and number density of atoms in component @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the inter- and intra - component @xmath11-wave scattering lengths @xcite . however , in some atomic species , @xmath12 is too small to create significant spin squeezing in any reasonable time . in rubidium 87 for example , where the relevant atomic states are the @xmath13 and @xmath14 hyperfine ground states , @xmath15 . despite this , spin squeezing in rb 87 becs has been demonstrated by manipulation of one of the scattering lengths via a feshbach resonance @xcite to increase @xmath12 .",
    "spin squeezing has also been demonstrated by manipulating the external confining potential of each spin component to separate them spatially , thereby decreasing @xmath16 in eq.([chiij ] ) and increasing @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these schemes used becs containing only a few thousand atoms , as a higher atom number increases the interaction energy , compromising the single - mode behaviour upon which these schemes require . spin squeezing via one - axis twisting in non - condensed samples of rb 87",
    "has also been achieved by manufacturing an artificial nonlinearity via coupling to an optical cavity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate a considerably simpler scheme to obtain both relative number and spin squeezing that does not require precise magnetic field control for feshbach resonances , time- and state - dependent potentials , or optical cavities , considerably simplifying the process .",
    "our scheme utilizes the inherent mean - field dynamics of the two - component system  which arise from the slight asymmetry in the s - wave scattering lengths and periodically decrease the spatial overlap of the two components  to create a much higher @xmath12 , leading to significant squeezing .",
    "furthermore , it demonstrates that strong multimode dynamics are nt necessarily detrimental to generating spin squeezing , allowing the possibility of spin - squeezing via one - axis twisting in becs with a large , metrologically useful number of atoms .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : in section ii , we describe our spin squeezing scheme and present a multi - mode simulation of the quantum dynamics using the truncated wigner approach , which has been shown to be highly successful in simulating such systems @xcite . in section iii , we derive an effective two - mode semi - analytic model , and discuss validity of this model . in section iv , we discuss how the level of squeezing can be controlled by changing the strength of the trapping potential and performing multiple @xmath17 pulses , and the effect of multi - mode dynamics on the mode - overlap . in section",
    "v , we discuss the usefulness of this scheme for enhanced atom - interferometry .",
    "our spin squeezing scheme follows the one - axis twisting scheme @xcite , for which there has been much theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "our scheme is outlined in figure([fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "we consider a @xmath18rb bec with two hyperfine levels , @xmath19 and @xmath20 confined in a spherically symmetric harmonic potential . in this proposal ,",
    "all of the condensate atoms are initially prepared in the @xmath21 state and then apply a short @xmath22-microwave coupling pulse to transfer half of the population of the atoms into the @xmath23 state .",
    "the system is then left to evolve for a period of free evolution , in the absence of any microwave coupling . during this period ,",
    "nonlinear interactions between the atoms and the slight asymmetry in the scattering lengths then causes the wave function of the two components to spatially separate and recombine in an oscillatory manner @xcite .",
    "the parameter governing the squeezing rate , @xmath12 is greatly increased when the two components spatially separate @xcite .",
    "a spin echo pulse is applied at the midpoint of the free evolution to correct for dephasing effects due to uncertainty in the total number of particles @xcite . in particular parameter regimes ,",
    "the wave functions of the two components approximately overlap at the end of the free evolution period , allowing for high - contrast interferometry between the two modes .",
    "a second microwave coupling pulse is then applied for a variable time @xmath24 .",
    "the behaviour of the system is intuitive in the context of the three pseudo spin operators @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the annihilation operator for an atom at position @xmath27 in hyperfine state @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the number operator for atoms in hyperfine state @xmath28 , where @xmath30 .",

    "the first coupling pulse rotates the spin expectation value to the equator . during the period of free evolution",
    ", inter - particle interactions cause a nonlinear phase shift , shearing the uncertainty of condensate spin , as well as a drift around the equator .",
    "a @xmath17 pulse followed by another period of free evolution reverses the effect of the drift , while maintaining the shearing . at the end of the free evolution a phase shift of @xmath31 rotates the state to lie along the @xmath32 axis , where the final adjustable coupling pulse rotates the state by an amount @xmath33 .",
    "this rotation angle is required to rotate the squeezed quadrature into the @xmath34 basis such that it can be directly detected by measuring the population difference between the two components .",
    "unlike the two previous experimental schemes , our scheme does not rely on using feshbach resonance @xcite or a state dependent potential @xcite to enhance the effective non - linearity of the two component rubidium bec .",
    "instead , we utilize the inherent mean - field dynamics of the two components to enhance squeezing .",
    "this requires only adjustment of the trap frequencies and timing of coupling pulses .",

    "we have demonstrated how to use multi - mode dynamics to enhance the one - axis twisting rate in order to prepare a state with reduced fluctuations in particle number difference . in order to use this state for interferometry with sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit ( sql )",
    ", the output from the final beam - splitter of the one - axis twisting scheme would be used as the input to a two - port mach - zehnder interferometric scheme .",
    "that is , a 50/50 beamsplitter , followed by a relative phase shift @xmath0 between components @xmath130 and @xmath131 caused by the physical process one wishes to examine , followed by a final 50/50 beamsplitter .",
    "the coupling operations occur on a timescale much faster than the motional dynamics , so the motional dynamics can be neglected during the beamsplitter phases .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the time between the beamsplitters , @xmath213 is short compared to the timescale for motional dynamics .",
    "typically the sensitivity of atom interferometry scales linearly with @xmath214 , so it may be desirable to increase @xmath214 beyond the regime of validity of this approximation .",
    "we will discuss the implications of this below .",
    "using these approximations , we can solve for the dynamics analytically in the heisenberg picture @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the field operator after the final beam splitter of the squeezing sequence ( and input of the mach - zehnder interferometer ) , and @xmath217 is the field operator after the final beamsplitter of the mach - zehnder interferometer . at this point ( @xmath218 ) , the number difference is measured , from which we can estimate the value of the applied phase shift .",
    "the phase sensitivity of the device is given by @xmath219 for uncorrelated input states , we recover the standard quantum limit @xmath220 @xcite .",
    "noticing that @xmath221 and using eq.([mz1 ] ) and eq.([mz2 ] ) , we find @xmath222 .",
    "if we ensure that our input state lies along the @xmath32 axis ( that is , @xmath223 , which can always be achieved by suitable choice of a deterministic phase shift ) , the slope of our signal will be maximum at @xmath224 ( or @xmath17 ) . in this case , we can write the maximum phase sensitivity as @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the usual spin squeezing parameter @xcite . figure([paramspam ] ) shows @xmath194 calculated immediately after the final beam - splitter for different values of @xmath188 from the spherically symmetric tw simulation . for @xmath227 rad s@xmath191 , @xmath228 , which indicates an interferometric phase uncertainty @xmath229 times better than for uncorrelated particles , or equivalent to using @xmath230 times as many uncorrelated particles .    in writing eq.([mz1 ] ) and eq.([mz2 ] ) we have neglected the motional dynamics of each component during the mach - zehnder process .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the overlap between the modes is unchanged during the interferometer process ( however , in calculating @xmath194 we have taken into account the effect of imperfect overlap at the input to the mach - zehnder ) . to gain any significant benefit from the spin squeezing",
    ", the interferometry scheme must involve a high - degree of overlap between the two modes . in a trapped configuration , this would limit the duration @xmath231 of the interferometer to very short times , before the multi - mode dynamics from the strong nonlinear interactions begin to degrade the overlap . alternatively , setting @xmath231 to multiples of @xmath189 would also achieve high - overlap due to the revivals in @xmath86 . for some applications , such as inertial sensing ,",
    "an atom interferometer that operates in free fall is desirable , as it is isolated from vibrational noise ( aside from that coupled in through the control lasers ) .",
    "after the relative number squeezing is created , the clouds could be expanded by releasing , or adiabatically expanding , the confining potential . for an inertial sensor , momentum separation between the two modes",
    "is required , which could be achieved accelerating one of the modes with a state - selective bragg transition or bloch oscillation after the wave packets are sufficiently dilute @xcite . expanding the bec has the added benefit of reducing the density , which will reduce any deleterious effects due to nonlinear interactions , such as phase - diffusion .",
    "we have shown that spatial dynamics can be used to enhance the rate of one - axis twisting , to produce significant spin - squeezing without the use of a feshbach resonance or state - dependent dynamic potentials in atoms such as @xmath18rb where the squeezing rate would otherwise be too low .",
    "we find that generally tighter traps are better , leading to higher squeezing , which is achieved much more quickly , which will be important in the presence of loss processes such as collision with background gas .",
    "using a cylindrically symmetric potential causes the effective squeezing parameter to increase , but the time taken to achieve squeezing is also increased , and the increased dynamical excitations limit the degree of squeezing achievable .",
    "performing multiple bounces seems promising , but this also eventually causes a loss of overlap due to multi - mode excitations .",
    "we found that the best achievable squeezing for @xmath78 atoms is @xmath232 , with an overlap @xmath233 , by performing a four - bounce sequence in the tightest trap we considered , @xmath203 rad s@xmath191 .",
    "it seems unlikely that this scheme could yield significantly higher squeezing , as the achievable squeezing is very sensitive to the degree of overlap .",
    "however , even though this is considerably less than the theoretically achievable limit predicted by eq.([vanal ] ) , we are considering a large number of atoms , which will yield a large absolute increase in sensitivity for an interferometric device , equivalent to an increase of a factor of @xmath234 in the atom number .",
    "one of the benefits of incorporating the multi - mode excitations into the squeezing scheme , rather than trying to remove them altogether , is that it opens the way for one - axis twisting experiments with larger samples of atoms where previous schemes have been limited in the number of particles to try and maintain single - mode dynamical behaviour .",
