    "semiconductor quantum dots made by stranski - krastanow growth have attracted great interest over the past few years from the view of fundamental physics , as well as due to their application in optoelectronic and microelectronic devices . in order to understand the physics of quantum dots and model and design such devices the electronic structure needs to be accurately known .",
    "the large lattice mismatch between inas and gaas has enabled the fabrication of quantum dots putting it at the forefront of both theoretical and experimental research .",
    "different quantum dot shapes ( such as pyramid@xcite , lens@xcite and disk@xcite ) of inas / gaas self - assembled quantum dots are often reported .",
    "a range of theoretical approaches has been used so far to calculate the energy levels in self - assembled quantum dots - effective mass @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite and the pseudopotential method @xcite . in quantum dots with cylindrical symmetry ,",
    "symmetry considerations have been applied to effectively reduce the geometry of the problem from three - dimensional to two - dimensional , both in the effective mass and the @xmath1 method ( within the axial approximation ) @xcite .",
    "the possible symmetries of the states in hexagonal iii - nitride quantum dots have recently been determined @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the pyramid has been used in the effective mass calculation @xcite to reduce the size of the corresponding hamiltonian matrix , however in none of the @xmath1 calculations of pyramidal quantum dots has the explicit use of the symmetry of the hamiltonian been reported .",
    "the aim of this paper is to exploit the symmetry in @xmath1 calculation of the electronic structure of pyramidal inas / gaas quantum dots .    the symmetry of a pyramidal inas / gaas quantum dot when a full atomistic structure is considered is @xmath2 and is lower than the symmetry of the dot s geometrical shape@xcite . due to the computational complexity of the pseudopotential methods that take into account the atomistic nature of the structure , one often employs the @xmath1 method which is considered to be a reliable tool for modeling the electronic structure of quantum dots despite its known limitations@xcite",
    "the symmetry of the @xmath1 model itself is the symmetry group of the zincblende crystal lattice .",
    "when the model is applied to pyramidal quantum dots the symmetry group is the intersection of the geometrical symmetry of the pyramid shape and the zincblende bulk symmetry .",
    "since the pyramid shape symmetry group is a subgroup of the symmetry of the zincblende crystal lattice , it follows that the symmetry group of the model is the double @xmath3 group @xcite .",
    "two different approaches are used to calculate the strain distribution in quantum dots - the continuum mechanical @xcite and the valence force field model @xcite .",
    "when the strain distribution is incorporated in the @xmath1 method , the continuum mechanical model preserves the @xmath3 symmetry , while the valence force field model , due to its atomistic nature , breaks it @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the comparisons of the two models have shown that they give similar results @xcite . in this paper , we apply the 8-band @xmath1 method with the strain taken into account via the continuum mechanical model .",

    "most of the theoretical investigations of the inas quantum dots in a magnetic field have focused on the dots with a parabolic confinement potential @xcite or just on the conduction band states @xcite .",

    "we take the symmetric gauge for the vector potential @xmath22 .",
    "the plane wave method is based on embedding the quantum dot in a box of sides @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( fig .",

    "all the integrals @xmath76 are evaluated analytically , as well .    in order to find the energy levels and the wave functions in the quantum dot , the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : eigen ] ) should be solved .",
    "the direct application of this approach would lead to an eigenvalue problem of a matrix of size @xmath77 .",
    "however , it is possible to exploit the symmetry of the model to block diagonalize the corresponding matrix , as will be done in sec .  [",
    "sec : symmetry ] .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , the symmetry group of the model is the double group @xmath3 .",
    "the generator of the group is the total angular momentum @xmath78 and therefore the representations of the elements of the group are given by the operators @xmath79 , where @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 is a rotation by an angle @xmath83 . in order to find how operators @xmath84 act on the states ( eq .  [ eq : state ] ) , it is enough to find how @xmath85 acts on the states since @xmath86 .",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath78 is a sum of the total angular momentum of the bloch function @xmath87 and the orbital angular momentum of the envelope function @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89@xcite .",
    "therefore action of the operator @xmath85 on state @xmath90 is composed of a rotation of the envelope functions in real space generated by its orbital angular momentum @xmath88 and a rotation of the bloch function generated by its total angular momentum @xmath87",
    "@xmath91                         \\left[\\exp(-i\\varphi\\hat{j}_z)|i\\rangle\\right].\\ ] ] since the basis of bloch states @xmath10 is the eigenbasis of @xmath87 it follows that @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the eigenvalue of the @xmath94component of the total angular momentum of bloch function @xmath10 ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) .",
    "thus the operator @xmath85 acts on the state @xmath90 as @xmath103    by assuming the envelope functions as a linear combination of a finite number of plane waves , we have already reduced the otherwise infinite hilbert space of the model to the hilbert space @xmath104 of dimension @xmath105 formed by linear combination of plane waves multiplied by the bloch functions .",
    "the basis of the space @xmath104 is given by latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : bas }    @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath107 .",

    "we thus need to know how @xmath85 acts on the basis vectors . using ( [ eq : del ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : bas ] ) we find that @xmath108 one can note that for @xmath109 the acting of @xmath85 on the basis vector is just a phase shift and the orbit of acting of the group elements is just an one - dimensional space ( we shall denote it as @xmath110 ) , while for @xmath111 the orbit is a four - dimensional space ( that we shall denote as @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 to avoid multiple counting of the same space ) with the basis latexmath:[\\ ] ]    the elements of the symmetry adapted basis are finally given as : @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "the time necessary to diagonalize the matrix of size @xmath77 scales approximately as @xmath142 .",
    "therefore the block diagonalization obtained reduces the computational time approximately by a factor of 16 .",
    "since all the basis vectors of the symmetry adapted basis are linear combinations of one or four vectors of the plane wave basis , it follows that hamiltonian matrix elements in the symmetry adapted basis can be expressed as linear combinations of one , four or sixteen hamiltonian matrix elements in the plane wave basis .",
    "therefore all the elements of the four blocks are given by analytical formulae that can be easily derived from the analytical formulae for the matrix elements in the plane wave basis given in sec .",
    "[ sec : pwm ] .",
    "it can be proved by considering the two dimensional irreducible representations of the more general double group @xmath143 @xcite that states with the same absolute value of @xmath144 are degenerate in pairs ( the kramer s degeneracy ) .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted in the presence of external axial magnetic field @xmath17 when the symmetry reduces from @xmath143 to @xmath0 and the time reversal symmetry relation @xmath145 holds then .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that piezoelectric effects in single dots of realistic sizes are small , changing the eigen - energies of the system by less than @xmath146 , and can be neglected .",
    "it has also been shown that in a vertically stacked double quantum dot the influence of a piezoelectric field is more important since the piezoelectric potential generated by the two dots adds up in the regions above and below the dots , while it is almost cancelled out in the region between the dots .",
    "consequently , it is expected that in a periodic array of vertically stacked quantum dots considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] the piezoelectric potential in the region between the dots would be almost cancelled out and that the influence of piezoelectric effect on eigen - energies would be small .",
    "therefore the small piezoelectric potential that breaks the symmetry of the system from @xmath3 to @xmath147 can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "it belongs to the @xmath148 representation of @xmath3 group and therefore only the matrix elements between the states with @xmath149 are non zero .",
    "consequently , the piezoelectric potential does nt change the energies in the first order of the perturbation theory and second order perturbation theory is needed to take the piezoelectric effect into account .",
    "we introduce the following notation for the electron states @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is a positive integer labeling the states with given @xmath144 in increasing order of their energy .",
    "since the quantum number @xmath144 originates from the irreducible representations of the double group @xmath3 whose elements are generated by the total angular momentum , its physical interpretation is that it represents the total quasi - angular momentum .",
    "the hole states will be labeled by @xmath152 , with the same meaning of the symbol as for the electron case , except that @xmath151 labels the states in decreasing order of their energy , as is natural for holes .",
    "the hamiltonian of the interaction with the electromagnetic field is obtained by replacing @xmath153 with @xmath154 in the kinetic part of the hamiltonian . in the dipole approximation @xmath155",
    "can be considered constant in space and furthermore all the terms quadratic in @xmath155 are neglected . after calculating the matrix elements between states with a well defined symmetry ,",
    "we obtain the following selection rules .",

    "the method presented was applied to the calculation of the electronic structure of periodic array of vertically stacked pyramidal self - assembled quantum dots ( fig .  [",

    "[ sec : symmetry ] ) .",
    "its influence on the state energies was of the order of @xmath146 and less , confirming our assumption .",
    "two main factors influence the electronic structure of the periodic array of quantum dots  -  strain distribution and quantum mechanical coupling .",
    "the influence of quantum mechanical coupling is intuitively clear - as the distance between the dots increases the coupling is weaker implying smaller miniband widths . due to their large effective mass ,",
    "heavy - holes are the least influenced by coupling and the minibands of dominantly heavy - hole like states are narrow , while the minibands of electron and light - hole states are much wider .",
    "on the other hand , the strain distribution is complex and in principle all six components of the strain tensor influence the electronic structure .",
    "still , the most important are hydrostatic strain @xmath178 that determines the position of the electron and hole levels and biaxial strain @xmath179 whose main influence is on splitting of the light and heavy - hole states .",
    "the bigger the value of hydrostatic strain , the lower the conduction band states are in energy and the higher the valence band states are in energy .",
    "when the biaxial strain is negative , the light - holes tend to have higher energy than heavy - holes , while when it is positive the situation is opposite . having the importance of those two components of strain in mind",
    ", we have investigated first how they change when the distance between the dots in an array is varied .",
    "we have found that as the distance between the dots increases , the hydrostatic strain in the dots decreases . on the other hand , for small values of the period ,",
    "the biaxial strain is negative , while for larger values it changes sign and increases further .",
    "the dependence of the miniband minima and maxima on the period of the structure is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : el18 - 4 ] .",
    "this behavior is expected . when the dots are close , they are strongly coupled and the minibands are wide , while as @xmath25 increases the coupling is weaker and the energy spectrum becomes discrete .",
    "for large values of the period when the miniband width practically vanishes , we still see a rising trend in energy .",
    "this rise is caused by a still decreasing value of hydrostatic strain .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the range of strain effects is larger than the range of quantum mechanical coupling .    .",

    "their difference in energy is less than @xmath186 , too small to be seen on the graph .",
    "a comment should be given about the near degeneracy of those two states .",
    "it has been practice in the literature to say that these two states are exactly degenerate in the absence of a piezoelectric effect and that the piezoelectric effect breaks the degeneracy of these states .",
    "this is indeed true if the carrier energy spectrum in the quantum dot is modeled by simple one band schrdinger equation .",
    "the symmetry group is then @xmath187 , consisting of transformations in real space generated by the orbital angular momentum @xmath88 and the first and second excited state transform according to the same two dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath187 implying their degeneracy .",
    "however , when the 8-band @xmath1 model , which is inherently spin - dependent , is used , the hamiltonian no longer commutes with the rotations generated by orbital angular momentum , but the total angular momentum .",
    "the symmetry group is the double @xmath3 group that has only the one dimensional irreducible representations and there is no a priori reason for the states with different absolute values of @xmath144 to be degenerate .    in order to explain the near degeneracy of the states with different symmetry",
    ", we have further investigated the 8-band @xmath1 hamiltonian and checked that it would still commute with the transformations in real space generated by orbital angular momentum if the valence band spin - orbit splitting would be set to zero .",
    "since the influence of valence band spin - orbit splitting on the levels in the conduction band is not substantial , the degeneracy of the two states is small .",
    "we thus conclude that the origin of splitting of the first and the second excited state is not just the piezoelectric effect but also the valence band spin - orbit splitting .",

    "[ fig : veff ] , as the period of the structure increases , the effective potential felt by @xmath188 light - holes decreases , while quite oppositely the effective potential felt by heavy - holes increases . both of these trends are an expected consequence of the increase in the value of the biaxial strain .",
    "consequently , in the range of low values of @xmath25 the hole states with @xmath188 are dominantly of the light - hole type , while the states with @xmath189 are dominantly heavy - hole like .",

    "this point , where the inversion of the sign of the miniband effective mass occurs is different for different states , for the @xmath190 state it occurs around @xmath197 , while for the @xmath191 and @xmath192 states it occurs around @xmath198 .",
    "the light - hole content of the @xmath188 states decreases with increasing @xmath25 and eventually they become dominantly heavy - hole like .",

    "we further observe that the ground hole state for @xmath202 is @xmath190 having @xmath184 symmetry , while for @xmath203 it is @xmath191 having @xmath185 symmetry .",
    "therefore at the critical point @xmath197 , we observe an interesting effect of a simultaneous change of ground hole state symmetry , a change of the sign of the effective mass and a change of the ground state type from light to heavy - hole like .",
    "the spin orbit split band certainly influences the exact positions of the energy levels , however , being far in energy from the light and heavy - hole bands it does nt influence the overall behavior described in the previous paragraph .",

    "[ fig : veff ] that dominantly light - hole states would be confined outside the dots and dominantly heavy - hole states inside the dots .",

    "the magnetic field splitting between @xmath206 and @xmath207 states , as well as between @xmath208 and @xmath209 states is significant because the mesoscopic angular momentum  @xcite of those states is different from zero .",

    "the energy separation of the minibands has an important affect on the dynamical characteristics of the structure since it suppresses all the one particle energy conserving scattering mechanisms between those minibands ( like ionized impurity scattering ) and with further separation even suppresses the mechanisms with energy exchange ( like acoustic phonon and longitudinal optical phonon scattering ) .    , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath206 , @xmath213 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath212 states .",

    "although the magnetic field splitting is the most pronounced for @xmath222 and @xmath223 states , the effect of the separation of those minibands occurs at magnetic fields larger than @xmath224 , which is a consequence of larger miniband width than in the previous cases . apart from separation of the minibands , the magnetic field can also concatenate otherwise nonoverlapping minibands .",

    "in conclusion , we have developed a symmetry - based method for calculation of electronic states in pyramidal inas / gaas quantum dots . the corresponding hamiltonian matrix obtained by the plane wave method was block diagonalized into four matrices of approximately equal size , which enabled significantly faster calculation of energy levels within the plane wave method .",
    "the symmetry considerations not only enabled more efficient calculation of the electronic structure but also give more insight about the physics of the model by introducing the quantum number of total quasi - angular momentum and giving the selection rules for interaction with electromagnetic field .",

    "it was found that as the distance between the dots is increased , at a certain critical point the ground hole state simultaneously changes symmetry from @xmath184 to @xmath185 and type from light to heavy - hole .",
    "the influence of magnetic field on the energy levels is in general less pronounced than the influence of quantum mechanical coupling and strain but nevertheless it can be used for fine tuning of the properties of the structure since its increase or decrease is able to separate energy overlapping minibands ."
