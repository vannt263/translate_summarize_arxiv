    "hereafter during @xmath6  yr the cooling is determined by emissivity of neutrinos produced in direct reactions @xcite . for such temperatures neutrons and protons in the neutron star interior",
    "are highly degenerate",
    ". therefore the rate of the neutrino production is suppressed by the reaction phase space , the stronger , the more nucleons are involved .",
    "the most efficient are one - nucleon processes , e.g. , @xmath7 , called direct urca ( du ) reactions .",
    "their emissivity is @xmath8 , see  @xcite , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the nucleon density measured in units of the nuclear matter saturation density @xmath11 .",
    "the du processes are operative only when the proton fraction exceeds a critical value of 1114% .",
    "equations of state constructed from realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions , like urbana - argonne one  @xcite , show that this condition is fulfilled only at very high densities .",
    "this implies that the du processes may occur only in most heavy neutron stars , e.g. , with masses @xmath12 for the equation of state @xcite , where @xmath13  g is the solar mass . at @xmath14",
    "the proton fraction is typically about 35% , cf .",

    "note the smaller numerical prefactor and the higher power of the temperature for the emissivity of the two - nucleon processes compared to the du emissivity .",
    "in - medium change of the nucleon - nucleon interaction in the spin - isospin particle - hole channel due to pion softening may strongly increase the two - nucleon reaction rates , which , nevertheless , in all relevant cases remain significantly smaller than that for the du  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon bremstrahlung reactions , like @xmath17 ( nb ) and @xmath18 ( pb ) , have an order of magnitude smaller emissivity than mu .    at low temperatures",
    "the nucleon matter is expected to undergo a phase transition into a state with paired nucleons  @xcite .",
    "the neutron superfluidity and/or proton superconductivity take place below some critical temperatures @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , which depend on the density . at densities @xmath21",
    "neutrons are paired in the 1s@xmath2 state and in the 3p@xmath22 state at higher densities .",
    "protons are paired in 1s@xmath2 state for densities @xmath23 .",
    "paring gaps , @xmath24 , are typically @xmath25  mev and depend crucially on details of the interaction in the particle - particle channel , see fig .  5 in  @xcite .",
    "the gap in the energy spectrum significantly reduces the phase space of the nucleon processes roughly by the factor @xmath26 for the one - nucleon du process and @xmath27  for two - nucleon processes .",
    "however , even with inclusion of the nucleon pairing effects the du rate is large enough that the occurrence of these processes would lead to an unacceptably fast cooling of a neutron star in disagreement with modern observational soft @xmath28-ray data  @xcite .",
    "this statement has been tested with gaps varying in a broad band allowed by different microscopic calculations .",
    "certainly , du processes could be less efficient if one kept gaps finite also at high densities .",
    "microscopic calculations do not support this possibility .",
    "thus , according to the recent analysis the du processes most probably will not occur in typical neutron stars with masses in the range of @xmath29 , based on the cooling and the population syntheses scenarios  @xcite .",
    "the superfluidity allows for a new mechanism of neutrino production associated with cooper pair breaking or formation ( pbf ) , e.g. , the reaction @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where one of the nucleons is paired . for 1s@xmath2 neutron pairing the pbf emissivity",
    "was evaluated first in  @xcite in the bogolyubov @xmath32-operator technique and then in  @xcite within the fermi - liquid approach .",
    "the proton pbf emissivity was estimated in  @xcite with account for in - medium renormalization of the nucleon weak - interaction vertex due to strong interactions .",
    "mixing of electromagnetic and weak interactions through the electron  electron - hole loop can additionally change the proton vertex  @xcite .",
    "there are also relativistic corrections to the axial - vector coupling vertices of the order @xmath33 , @xmath0 are neutron and proton fermi velocities , @xmath34 ,  @xcite .",
    "these three effects together resulted in a one or two orders of magnitude enhancement of the proton pbf emissivity compared to that evaluated with the free vector - current vertex .",
    "thus , one concludes that neutron pbf and proton pbf emissivities can be equally important for neutron star cooling depending on the parameter choice and , especially , on relation between gaps @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the pbf emissivity for the @xmath37 neutron pairing has been analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "following @xcite the emissivity of the neutron pbf and proton pbf processes is estimated as @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath1 . having a large numerical pre - factor and very moderate temperature dependence of the pre - exponent",
    ", these reactions significantly contribute to the neutron star cooling provided gaps are not too small .",
    "these processes have been included in the cooling code rather recently  @xcite . from that time",
    "the pbf reactions are the main part of any cooling - scenario together with the mu processes  @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the pairing gaps are large",
    ". therefore surface temperatures of neutron stars computed in different approaches vary significantly .",
    "kundu and reddy @xcite and leinson and perez  @xcite made an important observation : all previous calculations of the neutrino reactions in superfluid matter disrespect the ward identity and , as a consequence , the conservation of the electro - weak vector current .",
    "the ward or in general case ward - takahashi identities impose non - trivial relations between vertex functions and green functions , which synchronize any modification of the green - function with a corresponding change in the vertex function .",
    "satisfying these relations one assures that the symmetry properties of the initial theory are preserved in actual calculations .",
    "for instance we start with the theory of weak interactions with a conserved vector current .",
    "the current would remain trivially conserved in calculations with only bare vertices and bare green functions . in strongly interacting systems",
    "the green functions change necessarily , but for quasiparticle green functions the current conservation is easily restored by a proper inclusion of short - range correlations in the vertices , cf .",

    "@xcite did not incorporate any medium effects , whereas  @xcite used dressed quasiparticle green functions together with dressed normal vertices . in case of the superfluid system situation is more peculiar .",
    "since in the superfluid system the nucleon green function notoriously differs from the free one , the vector - current vertex must get corrections even if no other interaction between quasiparticles is included .",
    "additional anomalous vector - current vertices disregarded in previous calculations must be properly accounted for .",
    "these corrections _ cancel exactly the vector - current contributions _ to the neutrino emissivity for zero neutrino momenta , cf .",

    "@xcite used the convenient nambu - gorkov matrix formalism developed to describe metallic superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the price paid for the convenience is that the formalism does not distinguish interactions in the particle - particle and particle - hole channels .",
    "such an approach is , generally speaking , not applicable to the strongly interacting matter present in neutron stars . in the nucleon matter at low temperatures the @xmath48 and @xmath49 nucleon - nucleon interactions in the particle - particle channel are attractive , whereas in relevant particle - hole channels they are repulsive  @xcite .",

    "<S> neutrino emission in processes of breaking and formation of neutron and proton cooper pairs is calculated within the larkin - migdal - leggett approach for a superfluid fermi liquid . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate explicitly that the fermi - liquid renormalization respects the ward identity and assures the weak vector current conservation . the systematic expansion of the emissivities for small temperatures and nucleon fermi velocity , @xmath0 , @xmath1 is performed . </S>",
    "<S> both neutron and proton processes are mainly controlled by the axial - vector current contributions , which are not strongly changed in the superfluid matter . </S>",
    "<S> thus , compared to earlier calculations the total emissivity of processes on neutrons paired in the 1s@xmath2 state is suppressed by a factor @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar suppression factor ( @xmath4 ) arises for processes on protons . </S>"
