    "in this paper , we focus on the border between physics and number theory .",
    "it can be regarded as a first step to investigate , in particular , whether quantum field theory can shed any light on some long - standing , yet unproved , mathematical problems in number theory .",
    "indeed it seems reasonable that the `` translation '' of certain difficult mathematical questions into the physical language might provide essential clues to better understand ( or maybe help to solve ) them .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that the hamiltonian describing quantum - mechanically a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator has an equally spaced spectrum ( in the appropriate units and after a shift corresponding to the zero point energy ) given by the set of positive integers .",
    "this remarkable property naturally leads to the following question : is it possible to use spectral properties of this or other operators to study and analyze problems of number theory , e.g. the distribution of primes or the goldbach conjecture ?    at the beginning of the 20th century , plya and hilbert independently suggested the possibility of proving the riemann hypothesis on the distribution of non - trivial zeroes of the riemann function @xmath2    by finding a hermitian operator with eigenvalues that could be put in correspondence with those of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "moreover , a remarkable connection between number theory and nuclear physics emerged ( see @xcite for a review ) as a consequence of a fortuitous meeting at princeton in the early s 1970s between the mathematician hugh montgomery and the physicist freeman dyson .",
    "it was then noticed that random matrix theory ( introduced in the physical sciences by eugene wigner in the fifties @xcite ) could model apparently unrelated problems of both fields .",
    "the level spacing of heavy nuclei and the non - trivial zeroes of the riemann zeta function showed a striking statistical similarity .",
    "this example is not the only one to suggest a link between physics and prime numbers . in 1990",
    "bernard julia put forward the idea of a fictitious , non - interacting , boson gas @xcite whose constituents were called _",
    "primons_. the partition function of the primon gas was found to be the riemann - zeta function @xmath2 .",
    "the idea of the riemann gas can also be extended to fermions leading to a relatively simple partition function of the form @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that more intriguing relations exist between the riemann gas , quark confinement and even string theory @xcite .",
    "this is a clear example of how studies initially started as a rather unorthodox approach to the riemann hypothesis can lead , in turn , to new and eventually fertile perspectives in physics and vice versa .",
    "a thorough summary of several suggestive relationships between different branches of physics and the riemann hypothesis can be found in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop a ( quite simple ) physical model involving a free fermionic field defined on a cylindrical space - time manifold , with prime excitation modes only . no relation with p - adic theories in physics",
    "@xcite has been envisaged in this work .",
    "rather , one of our goals is to introduce prime numbers within the standard language of quantum field theory ( qft ) and investigate its primary consequences . in particular",
    ", we will cast goldbach s conjecture into the standard language of quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "interestingly , as will be shown , the consistency analysis for the underlying qft ultimately involves the riemann hypothesis in the computation of the renormalized vacuum energy .      in june 1742",
    "the mathematician christian goldbach wrote a letter to his friend , leonhard euler , where he made his famous conjecture about prime numbers which can be split into the following two statements :    every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes    every odd integer greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes    the first statement is known as the _ binary _ or _ strong _ goldbach s conjecture ( gc ) .",
    "the second is known as the _ ternary _ or _ weak _ gc .",
    "note that if the strong gc is true then the weak gc is also true .",
    "if not otherwise stated , we will denote the strong gc as the gc for short .",
    "the weak gc was proved in 1923 by hardy and littlewood , for sufficiently large odd numbers as an  asymptotic \" result , assuming the truth of the riemann hypothesis . in 1937",
    "vinogradov again proved the weak conjecture for a sufficiently large ( but indeterminate ) odd number using analytic methods . in 1966",
    "chen jing - run proved that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a number with no more than two prime factors . at the present moment",
    ", the gc has been checked up to integers @xmath4 @xcite by using computers .      in 1849 alphonse",
    "de polignac ( 1849 ) made the general conjecture that there are infinitely many cases of two consecutive prime numbers such that their difference is any even number @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath6 it reduces to the twin prime conjecture . for @xmath7 there should be infinitely many cousin primes ... based on heuristic arguments , hardy and littlewood found in 1922 a law to estimate the density of twin primes @xcite , also discussed by clement in 1949 @xcite",
    ".    the following weakened form of polignac s conjecture ( pc ) can be enunciated by relaxing the condition on the necessity that both primes are consecutive :    any even number can be expressed as the difference of two primes in infinitely many ways .",
    "polignac s weakened conjecture can be seen as complementary to goldbach s conjecture .",
    "both polignac s and goldbach s conjectures have never been proved .      at first glance the riemann hypothesis ( likewise the two preceding conjectures )",
    "does not seem very complicated to state , but in fact it lies deep in the roots of number theory , in connection with the mysteries of the distribution of the prime numbers :    all non - trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part equal to one - half .",
    "the prime number theorem is equivalent to the assertion that no zeros of @xmath2 on the complex plane ( @xmath8 ) lie on the boundary of the critical strip ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "understanding how the non - trivial zeros are located relative to the critical line ( @xmath10 ) , remains today one of the deepest unsolved questions in mathematics .",
    "moreover , note that many developments in number theory are contingent upon the validity of the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) . in this paper",
    "we explore the connection between the rh and the gc and pc on the light of a quantum field theoretical model to be developed below .",
    "our starting point is the lagrangian density of a classical free real scalar field @xmath11 in a two - dimensional spacetime : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the space coordinate , leading to the well - known massless klein - gordon equation : [ kg ] _",

    "the modes labeled by positive values of @xmath25 represent complex waves that move from left to right , while negative values represent left - moving modes . obviously ,",
    "owing to the linear character of the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) , the @xmath26 field can be split into left and right moving ( chiral ) fields , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , both obeying the periodic constraint ( [ period ] ) , as : [ split+- ] ( t , x)=_-(t , x)+_+(t , x ) in such a way that the former ( latter ) only contains ( positive frequency ) fourier components labeled by positive ( @xmath29 ) and negative ( @xmath30 ) integer numbers , respectively . at the quantum level",

    "the decomposition ( [ split ] ) is somewhat bizarre , since it partially breaks conformal invariance .",
    "only the virasoro generators @xmath37 , with @xmath25 being an even integer , do preserve the above decomposition .",
    "however , in our considerations conformal symmetry will play a rather heuristic role .    now , with the goal of restating the gc and the pc in a field - theoretic language",

    "p e^-ap = ( 1+(-a)^2)+b_1- _ 0^ e^i t a ( ( -i t)-)dt+ o(a^1/2- )  , that , by combining a further expansion of the first term with the third , leads to ( [ fernandoexpansion2 ] ) . similarly , assuming the riemann hypothesis , the asymptotic expansion for @xmath134 can be cast in the form    [ expansiontprime ] 0_r|t^prime  ( ) _ tt|0_r : = _ p p e^-p / r = ( f(/r)+ o((/r)^-3/2- ) )  , where all divergences in ( [ fernandoexpansion3 ] ) are captured by the single function @xmath135f(a)=-_0^e^ita(2-it)t  .",
    "it is important to notice , however , that the terms of the form @xmath136 in ( [ expansiontprime ] ) are potentially divergent .",
    "one would need to know the form of the non - leading contributions in ( [ expansiontprime ] ) to see whether or not the asymptotic expansion can be expressed as a finite sum of hierarchical divergent terms . in order to do this",
    "it would be necessary to go beyond the asymptotic analysis presented in the appendix and study in detail the contributions to the asymptotic expansions coming from all the singularities in the integrands of ( [ intrep ] ) and ( [ intrep2 ] ) .",
    "the very complicated analytic structure of the relevant functions precludes us from making a definitive statement but , the presence of an infinite number of branch points originating in the non trivial zeros of the zeta function , strongly suggests that an infinite number of counterterms would be necessary to subtract all the infinities appearing in the expectation value of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "this would mean that the model is non - renormalizable .",
    "motivated by the goldbach and polignac conjectures in number theory and the classical results on abelian bosonization in two - dimensions we study in this paper the `` factorization '' of a real scalar field ( whose fourier expansion is made out of even modes ) as a product of two ( so - called prime ) fermion fields whose fourier expansion exclusively contains prime modes .",
    "we have subsequently investigated the quantum properties of this theory by studying the vacuum energy density . as expected , the short - distance behavior of the prime field is highly non - trivial and quite different from a conventional field theory on the cylinder . due to the restriction to the prime modes ,",
    "the short - distance singularity is no longer purely of the form @xmath137 , but rather of form @xmath138 this feature makes the calculation of the renormalized expectation value of the energy density quite involved .",

    "let us stress that the riemann hypothesis plays an important role in the calculation of the vacuum energy density .",
    "this is , in our opinion , a remarkable outcome of this work .",
    "the possibility of relating consistency properties of a particular field theory ( such as the one considered here ) to the riemann hypothesis would definitely be very intriguing .",
    "the non - renormalizability of the theory in the standard sense would suggest that there is some scale at which its properties change dramatically . for instance , the two - particle sector of the fock space reflects the gc at low energies . accordingly , the set of all two - particle states span all energies of the form @xmath139 .",
    "the non - renormalizability of the theory could signal a breakdown of the gc above some number density scale @xmath140 , acting as a sort of ultraviolet cut - off . by breakdown of the gc we should understand in this context that infinitely many even numbers can not be written as the sum of two primes .    on the other hand , since the value of the radius @xmath23 can be freely chosen , the ultraviolet cut - off and therefore @xmath70 should be in principle also as large as desired .",
    "this view actually suggests that the gc might be satisfied for arbitrarily large even numbers .",
    "one can envisage this possibility on deeper physical grounds by extending our study beyond qft , e.g. to string - like models , where dualities involving the size of @xmath23 ( like @xmath141-duality , see for example @xcite ) could allow one to exploit this fascinating idea .",
    "let us finally stress that no actual claim is made in this paper regarding the proof or disproof of the goldbach conjecture .",
    "our main result is to point out that a simple theory , a free field on a cylindrical spacetime with modes restricted to prime integers , is full of divergences , making impossible to properly define the vacuum energy .",
    "we believe that the truth of the goldbach conjecture may be deeply related with this result , but in a way not unraveled yet .",
    "we give here some basic results about the asymptotic behavior as @xmath142 of the functions @xmath143 where the sums are extended to the set of prime numbers @xmath104 . as a way to highlight the role of the riemann conjecture in the final form of the asymptotic expansions we will use complex variable methods .",
    "the functional series @xmath145 is convergent for @xmath146 with @xmath147 and uniformly convergent in every compact subset of this set , hence it defines a holomorphic function in the complex half plane @xmath148 .",
    "the best way to study the asymptotic behavior of @xmath149 as @xmath142 is to use mellin transform methods . in the present case",
    "the integral defining the mellin transform converges if @xmath150 and is given by @xmath151=\\sum_{p\\in \\mathbb{p}}\\frac{1}{p}m[e^{-a p};s]=\\gamma(s)p(s+1 ) \\label{mellintransformoff}\\ ] ] where @xmath152 denotes the prime zeta function .",
    "this function is defined , in analogy with the standard zeta function , by the functional series @xmath153 for complex values of @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "the mellin inversion formula provides us with the following integral representation for @xmath149 .",

    "we get contributions , from the residues at the poles of the @xmath181 factor , that add up to the constant @xmath182 this , combined with the euler constant @xmath45 , will give a final contribution equal to the mertens constant @xmath183 .",
    "once past the @xmath176 singularity , the integration contour can be displaced to the line @xmath184 and it is straightforward to show that the sum of the integrals on this contour is @xmath174 without invoking the riemann hypothesis .",
    "the singularities in the integrand are determined now by the poles of the gamma function at the non - positive integers , and the branching point of the logarithm at @xmath176 .",
    "the quick fall - off of the integrand provided by the gamma function allows us to freely move the integration contour in the negative direction of the real axis while wrapping around the singularities of the integrand . in order to compute the integral",

    "as long as the choice does not change the value of the integrand in the region where the initial integration contour lies this is allowed .",
