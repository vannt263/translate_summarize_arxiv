    "in summary , we have performed a comparative investigation of the structural properties of cliques in the original directed calling networks and its statistically validated bonferroni network .",
    "the statistical properties of the cliques of the two calling networks are qualitatively similar but also exhibit idiosyncratic behaviors quantitatively .",
    "we found that the members in large cliques are spatially close to each other , indicating the importance of geographic information on the local structure of social networks .",
    "based on the clique degree profile of each mobile phone user , the most active users in the two calling networks can be classified in to several groups with different calling behaviors .    the structural properties of calling network cliques reported in this work are relevant to the social interactions among humans , which may contain important information and deserves further investigations .",
    "for instance , the properties of average inter - member distance can be partially explained by the social brain hypothesis @xcite , besides the conjecture of belonging to a same organization such as a company for all clique members . because human processing power limits social group size @xcite and to maintain social ties is also costly in resources such as time and money , it is rational to observe shorter clique diameters for large cliques as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distance ] .",
    "cliques of size larger than four are a kind of meso - structure larger than motifs and smaller than modular communities .",
    "it is well documented that motifs and communities have important effects on the behaviors and functions of the associated complex systems .",
    "we thus argue that our empirical findings on the statistical properties of cliques in human communication networks may play important roles in human behaviors and affect social functions .",
    "for instance , social network is an important factor influencing the evolution of cooperation @xcite .",
    "it can be conjectured that these locally dense structures will be also very relevant to human s cooperative behavior .",
