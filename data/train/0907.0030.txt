    "this effect can still be enhanced by decreasing the scalar mass parameter @xmath26 and by adjusting the trilinear coupling @xmath28 , which influences the squark mass splitting . with scalar tops being light ( even becoming eventually the next - to - lightest susy particle ) , the squark exchange dominates the cross section for a @xmath106-ino - like neutralino , where a low value of @xmath29 suppresses the higgs - boson exchange ( our point iv in tab .",

    "the parameter point ii in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] was chosen as described in sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] so that the @xmath0-boson exchange is enhanced .",
    "the only viable way to do this is to increase the higgsino fraction of the neutralino , which in turn increases the coupling of neutralinos to the @xmath0 boson .",
    "another possibility would be to sit on the @xmath0-boson resonance , which would , however , lead to very small neutralino and chargino masses that are already ruled out by the lep experiments .",
    "the parameter point iii in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] was picked to use the higgs potential high - scale parameters to drive down the squark masses via the renormalization group evolution . on top of that , by choosing @xmath144 gev we induced a large mixing of the third generation squarks .",

    "a feature common to both scenarios is a distinct destructive interference between the squark and the @xmath0 boson which links these two scenarios ( see fig .",

    "the corrections are about 20% in the cross section as compared to the cross section in micromegas .",
    "this is not reflected in all regions of the wmap allowed regions in fig .",
    "[ figscan2 ] , since the contribution of the quark - antiquark final state falls to only 60%-40% , as we lower the higgsino parameter @xmath30 .",
    "this decreases the masses of the lightest chargino and of the second - lightest neutralino , which , through their @xmath32-channel exchange , increase the annihilation cross sections into @xmath145 and @xmath146 final states .",
    "nevertheless , the full susy qcd corrections shift the contour in the @xmath147 plane by @xmath148 gev in @xmath30 and in all instances shift the contour by more than the current experimental precision .",
    "the effect of the corrections to the cross section is not screened by other final states in the case of the scenario with a dominant squark exchange ( point iii in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the top quark final state accounts in certain regions for more than 90% of the annihilation cross section , and the mass of the scalar top is not light enough to allow for efficient co - annihilations .",
    "the hyperbolic shape of the wmap allowed regions in the @xmath149 plane is governed by the higgs - mass parameter combination @xmath150 .",
    "the effect of the corrections on the cross section is about 20% and causes a shift of the preferred value of the pseudo - scalar higgs boson mass by about @xmath151 gev .",
    "the relevant masses of our points iii and iv featuring very light stops are very similar , as can be seen in tabs .",
    "[ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] . the same holds for the annihilation cross sections . for the benchmark point iv , the exchange of a stop in the @xmath32- or @xmath33-channel is therefore favored , which is well visible in the top left panel of fig .  [ figxsec45 ] .",
    "the contribution from the @xmath0-boson exchange is here one order of magnitude lower than the one from squark exchange .",
    "again , an important role is played by the squark @xmath0-boson interference effect , which is here even stronger than in the case of point iii .",
    "the differences are the higgs boson masses , which were more than @xmath152  gev for point iii , but are @xmath153  gev here ( see fig .",
    "[ figxsec45 ] ) .",
    "the mass difference can be traced back to the mechanism by which we lowered the squark masses . for point iii , we had to induce a big difference between the high - scale higgs potential parameters , which drove the higgs - boson masses higher , whereas for point iv we changed freely the gluino mass parameter influencing the rges for the squark masses , which has not such a big effect on the masses of the higgs bosons .",
    "due to the large contribution from the exchange of the light squark , the annihilation into top quarks accounts for up to 80% of the total annihilation cross section ( see fig .  [ figscan4 ] ) .",
    "the subdominant final states here are again @xmath145 and @xmath146 , but also pairs of bottom quarks or leptons .",
    "note that also here the mass difference between the lightest neutralino and the lightest stop is not small enough for efficient co - annihilations .",
    "one small , but important difference is that the destructive interference is stronger for point iv than for point iii .",
    "this leads to negative correction effects when including the full susy qcd corrections ( when compared to the cross section of micromegas ) .",
    "the reason is that for this particular point the corrections to the squark exchange are effectively taken into account by including @xmath44 yukawa couplings and the only difference between our full calculation and the micromegas approximation are the corrections to the interference which push the full result down ( as seen in the top right part of fig .",

    "<S> we describe in detail our calculation of the full supersymmetric ( susy ) qcd corrections to neutralino annihilation into heavy quarks and extend our numerical analysis of the resulting dark matter relic density to scenarios without scalar or gaugino mass unification . in these scenarios , the final state is often composed of top quarks and the annihilation proceeds through @xmath0-boson or scalar top - quark exchanges . the impact of the corrections is again shown to be sizable , so that they must be taken into account systematically in global analyses of the supersymmetry parameter space . </S>"
