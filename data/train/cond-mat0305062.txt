    "from the first of nineteen century the economists have tried to find a way to use the formalism of physical theories in mathematical modeling of economy .",
    "the concepts of utility function and economical equilibrium entered into the financial theories in correspondence with potential energy and mechanical stability @xcite .",
    "the physicists have paid less attention to this subject till last decade @xcite .",
    "recently they have more regards for studying the dynamics of the stock markets@xcite .",
    "the main source of their interest comes from fluctuation of stock prices with the time . understanding this behavior",
    "enable us to manage the strategies for trading @xcite .",
    "the statistical mechanics has appeared as a powerful method for exploring the price dynamics @xcite .",
    "the insurance is one of the important parts of the financial market with respect to trading risks . in the specified period of time , the results of a loss events ( risks ) that occur for the insurant are covered by insurance company and insurant also pays an amount of money to the insurer , which is called premium @xcite . in the competitive financial market",
    "the calculation of premium is very complicated .",
    "the premium is affected by random nature of risks and also variation in number of the insurants .",
    "the latter may be decreased due to an increment in premium and is increased by reduction of premium .",
    "the actuary is a branch of mathematics that studies the relation between paid and received money in order to assign premium to a category of risks .",
    "nowadays the physicists also pay attention to this part of the financial market .",
    "they look for a new way for the premium calculation on the basis of physical concepts @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are intended to explain how the equilibrium statistical mechanics may be used for premium forecasting . in the next section",
    "we describe the analogy between the financial market and physical system in contact to heat reservoir .",
    "a method for equilibrium insurance pricing will be suggested based on the canonical ensemble theory . in the last section",
    "the special case of car insurance is simulated and we compare our method with _ esscher _ principle which is the famous method in actuary @xcite and asset pricing @xcite .",
    "the financial market is combination of large number of economic agents which are interacting with each other through buying and selling .",
    "we consider the behavior of one of the agents for example an insurance company ; all other agents may be regarded as its environment",
    ". the agent exchanges money when interacts with its environment .",
    "we suppose the financial market is a closed system , the environment will absorb the money that the agent loses and supplies the agent s incomes . in equilibrium state",
    "a parameter that we denote it by @xmath0 has the same value for the agent and its environment @xcite .",
    "@xmath1    this parameter should be related to macroscopic properties of an economic agent .",
    "later on , we signify it for an insurance company in terms of its initial wealth , the mean claim size and the ruin probability .    like a physical system in contact with a heat reservoir we can nominate the following probability for @xmath2 , the net money which is exchanged between an agent and its environment at the end of specified time interval @xcite , @xmath3 the sum is over all possible amounts of exchanged money in equilibrium state .",
    "we assume here that the agent s money is considerably lesser than the money in the environment .",
    "the above result is confirmed by simulation @xcite and is also inferred from empirical data @xcite .",
    "for the special case of car insurance in the time interval @xmath4 , the insurance company receives premium from @xmath5 insurants and covers the loss results for @xmath6 car accidents . in each accident insurant charges the company for @xmath7 amount of money .",
    "thus the exchanged money at the end of interval is ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the premium . in the insurance terminology",
    "we call this money the surplus of company .",
    "the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are random variables which their probability distribution should be inferred from empirical data of the insurance company .",
    "premium calculation principle is a rule that assign to any distribution function ( correspond with loss events ) a real number @xcite .",
    "bhlmann in his brilliant papers on economic premium principle stated that premium calculation principle should also depend on market conditions in addition to loss distribution @xcite .",
    "he constructed a model for whole insurance market with many agents ; like insurance companies , reinsurance companies and buyers of insurance .",
    "he concluded that the sum of all incurred losses for all agents in the market shows the effect of surrounding market and it should be included in premium calculation principle .    in this work",
    "we introduce a new way for premium calculation .",
    "the number of insurants enters in our model as a reminiscence of the market conditions , the competition in the market changes it randomly as we mentioned above .",
    "the insurance company avoids of financial failure .",
    "premium should be calculated so that the surplus of company at the end of specified interval should be zero at least .",
    "this condition may be satisfied in mean .",
    "@xmath10    in real case premium is greater than the value obtained from eq .",
    "[ e3 ] because administration expenditures must be compensated and company also likes to profit , anyhow we are nt considering these matters .    if the number of insurants becomes constant then by simple calculation eq .",
    "[ e3 ] reduces to what is known as the _ esscher _ principle .    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the aggregate loss in the time interval @xmath4 , it is defined as , @xmath13    unlike to the net premium that is obtained by averaging the aggregate loss , in the _ esscher _ principle the premium is calculated by exponential tilting of loss events . the parameter @xmath0 appears to scale the weight of each event .",
    "there is no unique way for computing the @xmath0 parameter in _ esscher _ principle ; some authors use the optimization procedure @xcite and others relate it to the risk tolerance of the insurance company @xcite .",
    "the way that we adopt in this paper for determination of this parameter is also applicable here .",
    "the _ esscher _ principle as an efficient method for premium computing appears as a special case of our method .",
    "the difference between it and our method is shown in the next section numerically .",
    "to simulate our model , it is necessary to specify the distributions for the random quantities which are appeared in expression for the surplus , eq .",
    "[ e1 ] .    by assumption the number of loss claims by insurants , @xmath6 has poisson distribution with the mean @xmath14 .",
    "it depends only on the length of interval @xmath4 and also is statistically independent of the number of claims in any previous interval . @xmath15",
    "the important property of poisson distribution is that the times between successive claims are independent and identically exponentially distributed ( the _ erlang _ s model ) with the mean @xmath16 .",
    "it is what we encounter in most of the real cases .    the model for the claim size",
    "is constructed based on the knowledge and experience of the insurance company in addition to data from the past .",
    "the model should provide a balance between simplicity and conformity to the available data .",
    "the purpose of this paper is explanation of our method ; in this respect for simplicity we restrict ourselves to the exponential distribution for the claim size .",
    "otherwise we are forced to do a lengthy numerical computation that do nt correspond to our goal .",
    "@xmath17    the @xmath18 is the mean of the claim size .",
    "the product of the @xmath14 and @xmath18 is the net premium , @xmath19 .",
    "the insurance company which offer this value or less for the premium will be busted ultimately @xcite .",
    "the distribution for the number of insurants has not been modeled since now because it does nt be involved in the traditional methods for calculating the premium .",
    "[ e3 ] shows its importance in our method .",
    "however we assume the number of insurants is distributed uniformly with the mean , @xmath20 , and standard deviation , @xmath21 .",
    "this assumption based on empirical data of the iran insurance company @xcite .",
    "all the necessary parameters for tuning the mentioned distribution functions are obtained from statistical reports of iran insurance company for the case of car insurance in year 2000 @xcite . for independence of the results to any monetary units ,",
    "the initial wealth and premium are expressed in terms of the mean claim size and net premium .",
    "the following results are averaged over 10000 different possible states of the modeled insurance company .     the annual profit or surplus after @xmath22 days versus the premium for large @xmath0 .",
    "the premium and surplus are measured in terms of net premium.,width=321,height=207 ]    the variation of annual profit or surplus after @xmath22 days with premium for large @xmath0 , is shown in the fig .",
    "the desired value for the premium is obtained from calculation of the intersection point of approximated curve with the premium axis . for other values of the parameter @xmath0",
    "we can apply the same method for computing the premium .",

    "it is equal to the net premium .",
    "an increment in @xmath0 increases the premium but for large @xmath0 it approaches to a limiting value .",
    "the fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] demonstrates dependency of the premium on duration of insurance contract for the large @xmath0 .",

    "the premium for other values of the parameter @xmath0 shows the same behavior in the time .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 as a function of @xmath29 which is introduced in the text",
    ". the results for @xmath30 and @xmath25 times of the mean claim size are plotted .",
    ", width=321,height=207 ]    the parameter @xmath0 has been ambiguous since now . at this moment",
    "we proceed to clear its meaning .",
    "it can be understood by dimensional analysis of the eqs .",
    "[ e2 ] and  [ e3 ] that the parameter @xmath0 is proportional to the inverse of time .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] also confirms this statement , the behavior of the premium as a function of @xmath23 is the same for different time intervals in exception of their limiting values .",
    "the most important quantities which are used by the insurers for their financial decisions are the initial wealth @xmath31 and the ultimate ruin probability @xmath32 .",
    "the combination of them with the mean claim size @xmath18 is used in all methods for calculating the premium @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is also function of these quantities .",
    "the fig  [ fig4 ] shows the @xmath33 as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath34 and the initial wealth .",
    "this consequence is issued from relation of the ultimate ruin probability on premium @xcite , @xmath35}. \\label{e5}\\ ] ] and the result for dependency of premium on @xmath23 which is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    the ultimate ruin probability for exponential distribution of claim size can be calculated analytically as is seen in the eq .",
    "[ e5 ] , but in other cases it would be computed numerically from the following relation @xcite , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is related to the claim size probability @xmath38 , @xmath39dy\\ ] ] and @xmath40 is the @xmath41-fold convolution of @xmath42 with itself .    the fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] also indicates if the initial wealth becomes large for a fixed time interval the parameter @xmath0 approaches to zero .",
    "this means that a wealthy company buys the risks with the less premium in comparison to the small companies which offer more expensive insurance .",
    "this fact conforms to our experience in the financial market .",
    "the premium versus the parameter @xmath23 for @xmath43 days interval .",
    "the results of our method ( canonical ensemble theory ) and _ esscher _ principle are plotted for comparison.,width=321,height=207 ]    as mentioned before the _ esscher _ principle is concluded from our method .",
    "the variation in number of insurants changes the premium certainly .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] displays the difference between two methods numerically .",
    "we construct a simple model for the cash flow in an insurance company for the category of non - life insurance . a new method is suggested for calculation of premium on the basis of the canonical ensemble theory .",
    "this method considers the effect of the environment ( or market conditions ) by introducing a new random variable , the number of insurants , into the equation of cash flow . in this respect the empirical data of an insurance company",
    "is sufficient for take into consideration of environment conditions .",
    "there is no need to acquire any information about other agents in the market unlike the bhlmann method .",
    "another advantage of this method is ability for extension in the small market case .",
    "the latter is under investigation by the author .",
    "the financial backbone of insurer company is concealed in the parameter @xmath0 which play essential role in our method for computing the premium .",
    "when we omit the effect of market conditions by considering constant value for number of insurants the _ esscher _ principle is emerged as a result .",
    "difference between our method and the _ esscher _ principle that is apparently due to the effects of environment is shown numerically ."
