    "starbursts are periods of enhanced star formation , generally in the central several hundred parsecs of a galaxy , that will exhaust the available gas supply in significantly less than a hubble time .",
    "starburst events in dwarf galaxies are particularly interesting as there is the potential for major mass loss from the galaxy and the ejection of a significant fraction of the interstellar medium ( ism ) due to superbubbles and galactic winds driven by the pressure of thermalised supernova and stellar wind ejecta from the massive stars created in the starburst .",
    "the basic model for a starburst driven wind ( suchkov 1994 ) is conceptually simple : the thermalised kinetic energy from massive stellar winds and sn ejecta in the starburst region create a hot , x - ray emitting bubble in the ism of host galaxy .",
    "this expands , sweeping up and shock heating the ambient medium to form a superbubble . in a disk - like ism",
    "this superbubble will break out of the disk after a few million years to form a bipolar galactic wind , as seen around m82 ( watson , stanger & griffiths 1984 ; strickland , ponman & stevens 1997 ) . in dwarf galaxies with less disk - like isms",
    ", the superbubble may sweep up and accelerate a significant fraction of the ism to escape velocity ( de young & heckman 1994 ) before blowing out into the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the loss of gas , and in particular material enriched with heavy elements due to nucleosynthesis in massive stars , has a range of cosmological implications : for the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies ( bradamante , matteucci & dercole 1998 and references therein ) ; their structure and evolution , possibly turning di galaxies into de galaxies ( see marlowe 1997 for a detailed discussion ) or disrupting them totally if they do nt have massive dark haloes ( vader 1986 ; dekel & silk 1986 ) ; and for the chemical enrichment and heating of the intra - galactic medium ( spaans & norman 1997 ) .",
    "the study of local starbursting dwarf galaxies has been invigorated by the discovery of low mass star forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts .",
    "local starburst galaxies are readily accessible analogues of the star forming galaxies at higher redshifts , allowing the processes of galaxy evolution and formation to be investigated at a level of detail otherwise unobtainable .",
    "understanding the effect of starbursts on low mass galaxies requires quantitative measurements of the total energy and mass of gas ( and newly synthesised heavy elements ) incorporated into starburst - driven superbubbles and galactic winds , and how much of this escapes the galaxy , as a function of the properties of the host galaxy and the star formation rate .",
    "x - ray observations provide the only direct probe of the hot , metal enriched , gas that fills most of the volume of superbubbles and contains most of the energy .",
    "most of the mechanical energy injected by the stellar winds and supernovae into a superbubble is stored as thermal energy in the hot bubble interior .",
    "this hot phase also contains the newly synthesised heavy elements .",
    "dense gas swept up and shock - heated by superbubbles and winds does emit optical emission lines , most notably h@xmath8 , but this is only an indirect probe of superbubbles and winds .",
    "the optical emission lines are predominantly excited by photoionisation from the massive stars ( martin 1997 ) , making it much harder to study superbubbles with them .",
    "x - ray observations therefor provide the best single way to study starburst - driven superbubbles and galactic winds .    characteristically , the x - ray emission from superbubbles and galactic winds is soft , @xmath9 .",
    "although the specific energy of the supernova ejecta corresponds to a temperature @xmath10 if efficiently thermalised , hard x - ray emission from superbubbles and galactic winds will be much weaker than the soft x - ray emission from gas at several million degrees kelvin .",
    "thermal conduction and mass loading both introduce cooler and denser material into the interior of superbubbles , which dominate the x - ray emission as the luminosity is proportional to the square of the density ( weaver 1977 ; hartquist 1986 ) . in galactic winds",
    "much of the soft x - ray emission is believed to come from shock - heated clouds caught up in a faster moving , hotter but more tenuous wind ( suchkov 1994 ) .",
    "soft x - ray emission associated with the central regions and haloes of starburst galaxies is therefore taken as evidence of starburst - driven bubbles or winds .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is seen extending beyond the optical disks of some of the nearest starburst galaxies such as m82 ( strickland 1997 ) , ngc 1569 ( heckman 1995 ) and ngc 4449 ( della ceca , griffiths & heckman 1997 ) , with properties consistent with those expected of mature galactic winds .",
    "the observational status of x - ray emission from younger starbursts , where the superbubbles are still confined within the disk of the galaxy , is more uncertain .",
    "_ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) observations of dwarf star forming galaxies such as ngc 5253 ( martin & kennicutt 1995 ) , i zw 18 ( martin 1996 ) and ngc 4861 ( motch , pakull & pietsch 1994 ) show unresolved soft x - ray sources coincident with their starburst regions . these are believed to be superbubbles on the basis of their soft thermal spectra and association with the starburst .",
    "unfortunately , current x - ray instruments with the spectral - imaging capabilities necessary to identify superbubbles have , at best , only moderate spatial resolution .",
    "for example , the _ rosat _ pspc s ( the highest spatial resolution spectral - imager to have been flown at the time of writing ) ( equivalent to @xmath11 at the distance of m82 or ngc 5253 ) ! ] spatial resolution of @xmath12 corresponds to a physical size of @xmath13 at a distance of @xmath14 , typical of a _ nearby _ starburst galaxy such as ngc 5253 or m82 .",
    "this resolution is too low to resolve any young superbubbles , and hence higher resolution x - ray observations are required to establish the exact origin of the emission . without high resolution x - ray observations , the exact source of the soft x - ray emission is unknown , and point source contamination of spectra also becomes a potential problem .",
    "this ambiguous observational status is unfortunate , as the superbubble phase is important to study for several reasons :    1 .",
    "the dynamics of superbubbles are less complicated than those of mature galactic winds ( suchkov 1994 ) , which are not as well understood as those of superbubbles . as a result a quantitative understanding of superbubbles should be easier to achieve .",
    "the superbubble phase is the best time to study the coupling between the massive stars formed in the starburst and the ism they affect through superbubbles . once the superbubble has blown out of the ism into the igm the interaction between the hot gas from the starburst and the remaining ism is reduced , and as the wind expands into the halo the x - ray emission gets fainter as the density drops .",
    "the parent stellar population of a young superbubble will also be easier to identify and study .",
    "studies of the superbubble phase are important for calibrating and constraining the theoretical models necessary to understand the later , more complex , galactic wind phase and for obtaining quantitative estimates of the total mass and energy ejected from starburst galaxies .",
    "x - ray observations can not be used on their own , as they provide ambiguous results .",
    "standard single or two temperature spectral model fits to x - ray data do not accurately represent the complex multi - temperature gas distribution in superbubbles , as hence can not be used to accurately infer the true gas properties ( see strickland & stevens 1998 ) on their own .",
    "we decided to observe the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 5253 with the high resolution imager ( hri ) on board _ rosat _ , with the aim of resolving and determining the origin of the soft x - ray emission seen by the _",
    "pspc , believed to be a luminous superbubble ( martin & kennicutt 1995 ) .",
    "ngc 5253 is an ideal target for several reasons :    1 .",
    "it is widely acknowledged to be a very young starburst .",
    "rieke , lebofsky & walker ( 1988 ) place it as the youngest starburst in their chronological sequence of starbursts based upon its high br@xmath15 equivalent width .",
    "its radio spectrum is almost entirely thermal , unlike many starburst galaxies , indicating very few classical supernova remnants ( beck 1996 ) .",
    "spectral features due to wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars have been identified in two of the massive star clusters , constraining them to be only 3  @xmath16 old ( schaerer 1997 ) .",
    "soft x - ray emission attributed to a luminous superbubble had already been discovered in the rosat pspc observation of martin & kennicutt ( 1995 ) .",
    "it is one of the nearest wolf - rayet galaxies ( conti 1991 ) at a distance of @xmath17 , but is clearly an older and more evolved starburst galaxy with a complex star formation history and a well developed galactic wind ( vallenari & bomans 1996 ; gonzlez delgado 1997 ) . ]",
    "( saha 1995 ) .",
    "wolf - rayet galaxies are a class of young starburst galaxies , and are significantly x - ray overluminous compared to a sample of `` normal '' galaxies and more mature starbursts ( stevens & strickland 1998a , 1998b ) .",
    "their _ rosat _ pspc spectra are best characterised as emission from a soft thermal plasma .",
    "one explanation for their excess x - ray luminosity is that it is due to young superbubbles , which later blow out of the galaxy and fade .",
    "ngc 5253 therefore represents a chance to study at high resolution ( the @xmath18 resolution of the hri corresponds to a physical size of @xmath19 at the distance of ngc 5253 ) the x - ray properties of a very young starbursting dwarf galaxy , with a wealth of supporting observations at other wavelengths reported in the literature .",

    "the possible sources of the five x - ray components are discussed in   [ sec : discussion ] , concentrating on superbubbles , supernovae , supernova remnants and massive x - ray binaries , given the association between the x - ray emission and the young massive stars in the starburst region .",
    "we conclude that multiple superbubbles blown by the massive clusters of young , recently - formed stars probably dominate the x - ray emission from ngc 5253 .",

    "ngc 5253 was observed by the _ rosat _ hri ( david 1996 ) for @xmath29 between the 25th to 28th , july 1996 .",
    "the data was reduced and analysed using the asterix x - ray analysis package . for a detailed description of the _ rosat _ hri see david ( 1996 ) or briel ( 1994 ) . after screening for periods of poor pointing accuracy ( a negligible reduction ) and dead - time time correction ,",

    "the pulse height analyser ( pha ) distribution of the hri background , which is mainly particle events as opposed to the soft x - ray background , differs from the pha distribution of x - ray sources . to reduce the background we used only data between pha channels 3 and 8 , inclusive",

    "the absolute positions of _ rosat _ hri sources are only accurate to @xmath34 ( briel 1994 ; david 1996 ) .",
    "this corresponds to an physical uncertainty of @xmath35 assuming the distance to ngc 5253 is @xmath36 .",
    "this uncertainty can be reduced if x - ray sources within the field of view can be identified with objects at other wavelengths , where usually the positions are known with better accuracy ( see , among many examples , wang 1995 ) .",

    "depending on the separation between individual massive clusters , and the history of star formation in the vicinity , there may or may not be periods during which each cluster blows its own superbubble before bubbles meet and merge .      the purpose of this simulation is to obtain an order - of - magnitude estimate of the x - ray luminosity of a young superbubble as a function of time . given the uncertainty in the masses and ages of the clusters in ngc 5253 , and the state of the ( multi - phase ) ism , a detailed comparison of the observed x - ray emission with hydrodynamical modeling requires exploring a large parameter space . as discussed below in   [ sec : lxfactors ] , there are several factors that can alter the x - ray luminosities inferred from the hri observation and those from our simulations .",

    "only higher resolution x - ray spectral imaging by _ axaf _ can conclusively prove this to be the case , and identify the origin of the individual components .",
    "what implications do these possible multiple superbubbles have on starburst - driven mass loss and metal ejection from ngc 5253 ?",

    "the coupling between the energy supplied by the sne and stellar winds from the starburst and the ism is crucial in determining the amount of gas and metal lost from dwarf galaxies .",
    "the energy supplied by the multiple supernovae is sufficient to eject a large mass of gas from the shallow gravitational potential well of a dwarf galaxy , but this energy must be transferred from the thermal energy of the hot bubble interior to kinetic energy in bulk motions of the ambient ism .    as a simple estimate of the power of a starburst ,",

    "@xmath283 is an upper limit .",
    "a single cluster of @xmath6 , typical of the brighter clusters in ngc 5253 , will inject @xmath284 of mechanical energy into the ism over the lifetime of the lowest mass star to go sn , @xmath238 . if we adopt the total initial mass for the entire starburst from   [ sec : supernovae ] of @xmath285 then @xmath286 .",
    "ngc 5253 s total mass is @xmath287 ( @xmath288 of which is gas , kobulnicky & skillman 1995 ) , so the escape velocity is @xmath289 , using eqn .  28 . of mac low & ferrara ( 1998 ) .",
    "hence based on the very simple energetics argument above we might expect _ at maximum _ @xmath290 of the ism to be ejected from ngc 5253 over the entire history of the current starburst .",
    "once any superbubble breaks out of the disk into the halo , the coupling of the starburst to the remaining ism is reduced as the bubble escapes the disk and expands preferentially into the much lower density and pressure environment of any galactic halo medium and the igm , venting the thermal energy of the bubble interior .",
    "the hot gas previously forming the superbubble interior accelerates outwards as a galactic wind , carrying with it the fragmented remains of part of the dense superbubble shell ( between 4  9% of the shell mass in mac low s [ 1989 ] simulations of superbubbles blown by normal ob associations ) .",
    "the amount of energy transferred to the ism then drops once any effective chimney to the halo is created , and hence the amount of gas ejected with the hot , unbound , wind material is also reduced .    how effectively the starburst couples with the ism depends on the structure and distribution of the ism in the galaxy , as well as the mechanical power of the starburst",

    "they found that thin disks , dense disks , and low total energy injection all encourage blow - out along the minor axis .",

    "the energy injection rate was assumed to be constant in time , lasting for @xmath112 .",
    "the maximum energy injection rate they considered was @xmath294 , equivalent to only a single @xmath295 cluster , which is unfortunately an order of magnitude or so lower than the total energy injection rate in a starbursting dwarf like ngc 5253 .",
    "they found that the total mass ejected at greater than escape velocity is @xmath296 for a galaxy with a gas mass of @xmath297 , although almost all the metal enriched gas escapes .",
    "although they did not perform a higher mechanical luminosity simulation appropriate for ncg 5253 and similar starburst galaxies , their results strongly suggest only a small fraction of the total ism mass is lost in the wind but the majority of the newly synthesised metals are lost .",
    "several authors have reported simulations of the more powerful starburst in m82 ( tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; tomisaka & bregman 1993 ; suchkov 1994 , 1997 ) , although they do not give quantitative values for the mass ejected .",
    "suchkov ( 1994 ) do use a more realistic sf history than previously considered , using the lh95 models to give the time - dependent mass and energy injection rates due to a constant star formation rate of @xmath298 , and they stress the importance of the starburst history in altering the dynamics of a galactic wind .",
    "they found that the weak initial mass and energy injection , due to stellar winds before any sne , creates a cavity in the disk without strongly affecting the disk ism .",
    "this allowed the hot gas from the much more powerful sne dominated phase of the starburst to escape virtually freely into the halo .",
    "we conclude that a sf history such as ngc 5253 s , with the energy injection spread out more over time due to the range in cluster ages , will reduce the total mass loss from the galaxy compared to the standard single superbubble model . hence realistic star formation histories ( and more realistic , multiphase ism distributions ) will reduce the efficiency with which starbursts can strip a galaxy of its ism compared to the single superbubble model .",
    "although total mass loss rates may be reduced , easier venting of the hot metal - enriched gas from the starburst into the igm will act to increase the metal ejection efficiency .",
    "the reason weaker mass and energy injection cause less disruption to the ism is that the total energy per unit volume ( or per unit mass ) they impart to the ism by the time the bubbles blow out is less , even though it may take longer for a weaker superbubble to blow out .",
    "post blow - out , much of the energy injected by the starburst , including any from later more powerful star formation , is simply vented directly into the halo without interacting with the remaining ism .",
    "this is due to the size of a superbubble being a stronger power of time than of wind luminosity @xmath178 , so much weaker bubbles need only be slightly older to occupy the same volume as a powerful superbubble . the total energy supplied to the ism is roughly proportional to @xmath299 . in the weaver model , where the ambient density and the wind luminosity are constant",
    ", then the volume of the bubble @xmath300 and the kinetic energy of the swept - up ism is @xmath301 . for time - varying energy injection and non - uniform ambient density the standard scaling relationships do not strictly apply , and the kinetic energy of the shell is not a constant fraction of the total energy injected ,",
    "but as they are approximately correct we shall use them to illustrate the point .",
    "the energy per unit volume supplied to the ism is then @xmath302 .",
    "weak superbubbles supply much less energy to the ism than more powerful ones do , even though both blow - out after sweeping up the same mass of gas . as a result",
    "weaker bubbles accelerate the ism to lower velocities before blowing out , and with lower ram pressure are less efficient at dragging dense gas out of the disk into the halo .    for example consider two cases where the mechanical luminosities differ by a factor of ten . if we assume blow - out",
    "occurs when any superbubble reaches some critical volume determined by the structure of the ism only , then we can evaluate both the time taken to blow - out and the energy per unit mass supplied to the ism in terms of the wind luminosity . to occupy the same volume , @xmath303 , a bubble an order of magnitude weaker would only take approximately twice the time to blow out , but only supply a fifth as much energy into accelerating and disrupting the ism .    as a result ,",
    "powerful starbursts that would have sufficient energy to unbind a significant portion of the ism of a dwarf galaxy in the absence of any other star formation , may have little effect on the ism if preceding weaker star formation and the resulting superbubbles open up channels to the halo that efficiently vent the hot gas from the main sf .",
    "even if we assume no preceding weaker sf within the starburst itself , natural levels of massive star formation and type ia sn in galaxies can increase the porosity of the ism and lead to significant filling factors of hot , low density gas in the ism that can act as vents for starburst - driven superbubbles ( see oey & clarke 1997 ; rosen & bregman 1995 ; rosen , bregman & kelson 1996 ) .",
    "the observational properties of the starburst will also differ from the standard single superbubble case , as the structure of the ism the superbubbles interact with will be determined by the history of mass and energy injection .",
    "the  emission , due to both photoionisation and shock heating , depends on the local sf history , as the ionising flux from young clusters is a strong function of time ( decreasing rapidly after @xmath304 ) , while bubbles both cause shock heating and allow ionising photons to propagate further out from bright uv sources ( see martin 1997 for observational evidence and a discussion of this ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the starburst is also proportional to a weak function of the ambient density ( see eqn .  [",
    "equ : n5253_lx ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath82 will decrease after blow - out as the galactic wind encounters only low density halo gas , and as the density of the wind material decreases as it expands into the galactic halo .",
    "the main remaining regions of x - ray emission will be in the interfaces between hot tenuous wind material and any dense gas encountered , near the chimney walls , shell fragments and clouds the wind shocks and ablates .",
    "the total mechanical energy released by the starburst in ngc 5253 is enough to unbind a significant fraction of its ism , but the total mass loss depends crucially on how well this energy can be transferred from the hot gas to the ism , before any blow - out and venting of the hot shocked gas into the halo as a galactic wind .    the sf history in ngc 5253 , with multiple clusters of different ages each blowing winds and bubbles into the ism , is more complex than the single superbubble model with a single instantaneous burst of sf .",
    "we speculate that the total mass ejected from the ism in a situation with a sf history similar to ngc 5253 s will be reduced compared to the standard single superbubble model , as the more gradual energy injection allows the hot gas created by the starburst to blow - out without transferring as much energy to the ism .",
    "later thermalised sne and stellar wind ejecta is then vented easily into the halo without interacting significantly with the remaining ism .",
    "this should also act to increase the fraction of the newly synthesised heavy elements that are lost , even though the total mass lost is reduced .",
    "it is unlikely that ngc 5253 will lose a significant fraction of its ism to starburst - driven winds , despite this being energetically feasible .",
    "we obtained a long _ rosat _ hri observation of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 5253 , with the aim of resolving the superbubble believed to be present on the basis of the _ rosat _ pspc observation of martin & kennicutt ( 1995 ) .    1 .   instead of a single superbubble ,",
    "hri observations show several , at least five , separate sources of soft , 0.1 - 2.4 @xmath305 , x - ray emission , associated with the massive young clusters of stars at the centre of ngc 5253 .",
    "based on the pspc spectrum the luminosities of the five components range between @xmath306  @xmath3 .",
    "three of the components are statistically extended beyond the hri psf at 90% confidence , the largest having a fwhm of @xmath4 arcsec , equivalent to @xmath5 .",
    "3 .   the possible sources of x - ray emission that can match the luminosities inferred from the hri observations , and are expected to be associated with massive stars are mxrbs , snrs and superbubbles .",
    "we would expect all of these sources to be present in ncg 5253 at some level , given the example of 30 doradus , but which is the dominant source of soft x - ray emission ? 4 .",
    "massive x - ray binaries can not be the predominant source , primarily for spectral reasons as the integrated spectrum from the _ rosat _ pspc observations is that of a soft thermal plasma , unlike the generally hard x - ray spectrum associated with mxrbs .",
    "this does not rule out one or two of the observed components , or some fraction of the emission from the extended components , being due to massive binaries , but summed over all the components the @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 spectrum must be soft .",
    "5 .   explaining the extended hri components",
    "as middle - aged x - ray luminous snrs requires each of the extended components ( b , c & e , hwhm @xmath271  @xmath272 ) to be comprised of several smaller snrs , as for a given x - ray luminosity , snrs will be much more compact , @xmath128 , than superbubbles @xmath269  @xmath270 .",
    "this model of several snrs per x - ray component begins to run into problems with the sn rate and the upper limit on the total number of snrs being @xmath131 from the thermal radio spectrum .",
    "we show that super star clusters and other massive clusters of stars , such as those observed by the hst in the centre of ngc 5253 , individually will be the source of strong winds blowing into the ism of the starburst region",
    ". these may be the source of _ multiple _ young superbubbles within the central regions of a young starburst galaxy such as ngc 5253 .",
    "we have performed the first hydrodynamical simulations of superbubbles blown by individual super star clusters with realistic time - varying mass and energy injection rates , in order to investigate whether they can be x - ray luminous enough to explain the extended soft x - ray components seen in ngc 5253 .",
    "the soft x - ray luminosity @xmath213 of the superbubble was found to be proportional to the mechanical energy injection rate @xmath273 , implying that superbubbles should be most x - ray luminous between @xmath205  @xmath206 , the wolf - rayet phase of the parent cluster .",
    "this may explain why wolf - rayet galaxies are observed to be x - ray overluminous compared to normal spiral and more mature starburst galaxies ( see stevens & strickland 1998a ; 1998b ) .",
    "the predicted soft x - ray luminosity for a superbubble blown by a @xmath6 cluster during this period and up to @xmath239 agrees very well with the luminosities inferred for the extended components from the hri data , although a variety of factors we discuss that are not considered in our simulations can influence the absolute magnitude of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "8 .   achieving the required x - ray luminosities with superbubbles or snrs",
    "requires them to be expanding into a region of higher than average density .",
    "this may also explain the lack of detected x - ray emission from some of the other bright clusters .",
    "given the count rates for the observed components , we would not detect sources with @xmath274 , so superbubbles with lower energy injection rates or expanding into regions of lower ambient density could easily have been missed by our _ rosat _ hri observations .",
    "9 .   in conclusion",
    ", the evidence favours several of the observed x - ray sources being young superbubbles , and that superbubbles are the dominant source of the x - ray emission from ngc 5253 .",
    "only higher resolution x - ray spectral imaging by _ axaf _ can conclusively prove this to be the case , and identify the origin of the individual components .",
    "if confirmed , this is the first detection of multiple superbubbles in a starburst region .",
    "we emphasise the importance of the sf history and distribution on the amount of gas and metals ejected from starbursting dwarf galaxies , in addition to the effect of the ism distribution that previous work had highlighted ( de young & heckman 1994 ; heckman 1995 ) .",
    "we speculate that the total mass ejected from the ism of a dwarf galaxy in a situation with a sf history similar to ngc 5253 s will be reduced compared to the standard single superbubble model , as the more gradual energy injection allows the hot gas created by the starburst to blow - out without transferring as much energy to the ism .",
    "later thermalised sne and stellar wind ejecta is then vented easily into the halo without interacting significantly with the remaining ism .",
    "this should also increase the fraction of the newly synthesised heavy elements that are lost , even though the total mass loss is reduced .",
    "it is unlikely that ngc 5253 will eject a significant fraction of its ism to starburst - driven winds , despite this being energetically feasible .",
    "we would like to thank crystal martin and varoujan gorjian for supplying us with optical images of ngc 5253 .",
    "we would also like to thank the following people for useful discussions and constructive criticism through various stages of this work : crystal martin , sally oey , the members of the birmingham `` galaxies and clusters '' group and the referee mordecai - mark mac low .",
    "dks and irs also acknowledge the funding support of pparc and the school of physics & astronomy .",
