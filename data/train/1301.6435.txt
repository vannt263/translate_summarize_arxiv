    "in the past decade , some observations have led to some tight relations between the central supermassive blackhole ( smbh ) masses @xmath0 and velocity dispersions @xmath1 in the bulges of galaxies .",
    "these relations can be summarized as @xmath3 . for @xmath4 , the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "have been estimated several times in the past 12 years : originally ( @xmath7)=(@xmath8 , @xmath9 ) @xcite and ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) @xcite , then ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) @xcite , and more recently ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) @xcite , ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) @xcite , ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) @xcite and ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "empirical fittings show that @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these relations correspond to all morphological type galaxies .",
    "one can separate the fittings into different groups such as the early - type and late - type or elliptical and spiral .",
    "for example , @xcite obtain @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the early - type and late - type galaxies respectively if they are fitted separately .",
    "the slopes are shallower than the combined one ( @xmath26 ) . moreover , the slope @xmath6 and the scatter of the @xmath27 relation are still subject to debate , particularly at the low mass ends .",
    "recently , @xcite obtain a new @xmath27 relation with low bh masses ( below @xmath28 ) .",
    "they find a zero point @xmath29 and slope @xmath30 , which indicate @xmath6 may be smaller for lower bh masses .",
    "also , @xcite obtained a better fit by using a log - quadratic form @xmath31 ^ 2 $ ] with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to doubt that the relation is not simply given by @xmath35 with @xmath6 just a constant for all galaxies .",
    "the @xmath27 relation has been derived by recent theoretical models @xcite . however , these models contain various assumptions and fail to explain the relations in the small smbh mass regime ( @xmath36 ) . in this article ,",
    "i present a model to get an exact @xmath27 relation , which can explain the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the empirical fitting in both small smbh regime and apply to different types of galaxies .",
    "i use the fact that the strong radiation of the accretion disk of a smbh can heat up the surrounding gas so that hydrostatic equilibrium of the latter is maintained .",
    "the cooling of the surrounding gas is mainly given by recombination , bremsstrahlung radiation and the adiabatic expansion of the gas . without any other assumptions , the exact @xmath27 relation is naturally obtained . in the following ,",
    "i will first present the details of the model .",
    "then i will fit our model with the data of @xmath1 and @xmath0 from 198 galaxies and show that it generally agrees with the empirical fitting .",
    "it is commonly believed that all smbhs accompany with accretion disks to emit high energy radiation during their formation .",
    "the luminosity of the disk is mainly come from the rest mass energy of the mass accretion .",
    "the accretion luminosity can be expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the efficiency of the process .",
    "let @xmath39 , where @xmath40 erg s@xmath41 is the eddington limit of accretion , we have @xmath42    the accretion disk of smbh provides a large number of photons to heat up the surrounding gas in the protogalaxy during the galaxy formation . assume that the power is mainly transmitted to the protogalaxy within a scale radius @xmath43 through radiation by compton scattering and photoionization .",
    "the optical depth of the gas is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number density of the hot gas and @xmath46 is the effective cross section of the interaction of photons and hot gas particles , which is closed to the thomson cross section @xmath47 for zero metallicity .",
    "therefore , the total power that can be transmitted to the protogalaxy is just @xmath48 . in equilibrium ,",
    "the heating rate is equal to the cooling rate by bremsstrahlung radiation @xmath49 , recombination @xmath50 , and adiabatic expansion @xmath51 @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 erg @xmath54 s@xmath41 , @xmath55 erg @xmath54 s@xmath41 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , are the temperature , pressure and volume of the gas within @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath59 can be written as @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite , where @xmath62 is the adiabatic index and @xmath63 is the mean mass of a gas particle . the virial relation of the effective total mass of hot gas @xmath64 and @xmath56 within @xmath43 is given by @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the virial constant .",
    "after the galactic bulge is formed , assuming spherical symmetry and by virial theorem again , one can get @xmath67 where @xmath68 is another virial constant . from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , and assuming @xmath69 , we get @xmath70 where @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 take @xmath75 ( isothermal distribution ) and @xmath76 @xcite , and combine with eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we have @xmath77,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , assuming @xmath79 , the last term dominates for @xmath80 km  s@xmath41 , which agrees with the observed range of @xmath6 .",
    "the fitting parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 are mainly controlled by the empirical fitting parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the observational data respectively . in fig .  1",
    ", we get an empirical fit by using the data obtained from @xcite . the effective cross section due to metallicity may contribute to a factor of 2 - 3 in eq .  ( 11 ) . by using the cross sections of some major metals ( carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , silicon ) calculated from @xcite and assuming metallicity of a protogalaxy is about @xmath83 solar metallicity @xcite , the effective ccross section is @xmath84 @xmath85 , which is about @xmath86 . also , the estimation of the @xmath0 is not too reliable for @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the fitting parameters are just an order of magnitude estimation . in fig .",
    "1 , the functional form of eq .  ( 11 ) generally matches the observational data .",
    "the best fitted parameters are @xmath87 and @xmath88 , with 4.9% rms error . by fitting with the form @xmath89",
    ", we can get @xmath90 with 5.1% rms error .",
    "therefore , two functional forms can fit the data equally well .",
    "however , if we neglect the first two terms in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 11 ) , the best fitted line is @xmath91 with 12% rms error . as mentioned above",
    ", the first two terms are significant when @xmath0 or @xmath1 is small .",
    "therefore , the effective slope of the @xmath92 relation is shallower ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "that means the effect of cooling by recombination and bremsstrahlung radiation should be considered especially in galaxies with low velocity dipersion .",
    "our result is consistent with the recent observations which indicate that many supermassive black holes may involve a long period of moderate super - eddington accretion ( @xmath94 ) during their formation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the central number density in the milky way is about @xmath95 cm@xmath41 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath97 in the bulge .",
    "the best fitted @xmath82 is also consistent with the observational data .",
    "in this article , i present a new model to explain the @xmath27 relation in galaxies .",
    "the @xmath27 relation is not simply a power - law form @xmath98 , but partially depends on @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this exact form of the @xmath27 relation agrees with the recent observational data , especially in the small @xmath0 regime . in this model , we can obtain @xmath101 and @xmath22 , which is consistent with the observational data of the grouped galaxies ( small smbh : @xmath102 , @xmath36 ; early - type : @xmath103 , @xmath104 ; late - type : @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) @xcite . in general , this model suggests that larger @xmath82 and @xmath81 result in smaller slope @xmath6 and normalization constant @xmath5 in the relation .",
    "thus , if similar galaxies have similar bulge structure and accretion disks , then the @xmath27 relation of this particular type may be tighter .",
    "it generally agrees with the observation that the @xmath27 relation in elliptical galaxies only is less scattered @xcite .    in this model",
    ", the evolution pattern of the supermassive black hole does not affect the function form of the relation .",
    "the only physics here is the energy balance of the gas between the heating by the radiation from accretion disk and the cooling by the free - free emission , recombination and the adiabatic expansion of the gas particles .",
    "if the black hole is still significantly accreting , the energy given out would be balanced by the cooling of gas , which gives the eq .  ( 11 ) . when the black hole s activity is switched off , the relation between the kinematic properties of the bulge and the @xmath0 has already been established , which remains unchanged in eq .  ( 11 ) .",
    "therefore , the exact relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 can definitely apply in both active and non - active galaxies .",
    "all the parameters obtained ( @xmath94 and @xmath107 ) are consistent with the theoretical estimation and observation .",
    "generally , our result supports the moderate super - eddington accretion during the smbh formation .",
    "the variations of @xmath81 and @xmath82 within the groups of galaxies may result in the observed scatter in the @xmath27 fittings .",
    "all the above results arose from existing natural physical laws without any extra assumptions .",
    "this model provides a clear picture on how the properties of the galactic supermassive black holes are connected with the kinetic properties of the galactic bulges .",
