    "analogies between discrete and continuous packing problems have long played a key role in coding theory . in this paper , we extend these analogies to encompass discrete models of physics , by showing that certain classical codes are ground states of natural physics models .",
    "in fact , they are ground states of many different models simultaneously .",
    "we call this phenomenon _ universal optimality _ , motivated by @xcite .",
    "as we will explain after lemma  [ lem : cm - basis ] , a code is universally optimal if and only if all the binomial moments of its distance distribution are minimal .",
    "this problem has been studied by ashikhmin and barg @xcite , with a very different combinatorial motivation ( namely , counting pairs of codewords in subcodes with restricted support ) , and they gave some important examples , such as hamming , golay , and reed - solomon codes .",
    "thus , universal optimality is not a new property .",
    "however , the physics motivation appears to be new , and we provide new proof techniques . we also prove strong structural results about these codes , including our most surprising theorem : if the linear programming bounds prove a code is universally optimal , then it remains universally optimal if any single codeword is removed .",
    "let @xmath0 denote an alphabet with @xmath1 elements , and let @xmath2 denote the hamming distance between words @xmath3 .",
    "of course , this notation suggests that @xmath0 is a finite field , but we will make no use of the field structure .",
    "we view @xmath4 as a discrete model of the universe , and we envision a code in @xmath4 as specifying the locations of some particles . to separate these particles from each other , we will let them repel each other . specifically , we will choose a pairwise potential function between the particles , and then we will study the _ ground states _ of this system , i.e. , the particle arrangements that minimize the total energy .    given a code @xmath5 and a function @xmath6 , the _ potential energy _ of @xmath7 with respect to the _ potential function _",
    "@xmath8 is defined to be @xmath9 the normalization factor of @xmath10 is convenient but not essential .",
    "repulsive forces correspond to decreasing potential functions , and we wish the repulsion to grow stronger as the points grow closer together .",
    "the completely monotonic functions extend these properties in a particularly compelling way .",
    "let @xmath11 be the finite difference operator , defined by @xmath12 a function @xmath13 is _ completely monotonic _ if its iterated differences alternate in sign via @xmath14 ; more precisely ,",
    "@xmath15 whenever @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    for example , the inverse power laws @xmath18 with @xmath19 are completely monotonic . to see why , note that their derivatives obviously alternate in sign , and then the mean value theorem implies that the same is true for finite differences .",
    "a code @xmath5 is _ universally optimal _ if @xmath20 for every @xmath21 with @xmath22 and all completely monotonic @xmath23 .",
    "every universally optimal code @xmath7 maximizes the minimal distance between codewords given its size @xmath24 , because it minimizes the energy under @xmath25 as @xmath26 . however , universal optimality is a far stronger condition than that .",
    "the definition of universal optimality is analogous to that of cohn and kumar @xcite in the continuous setting .",
    "they studied particle arrangements in spheres or projective spaces and showed that many beautiful configurations are universally optimal , including the icosahedron , the @xmath27 root system , and the minimal vectors in the leech lattice .",
    "more generally , universal optimality helps explain the occurrence of certain remarkable symmetry groups in discrete mathematics and physics @xcite .",
    "bouman , draisma , and van leeuwaarden @xcite have independently studied energy minimization models on toric grids under the lee metric .",
    "their main theorem implies universal optimality for certain checkerboard arrangements of particles filling half of the grid , but they do not investigate other codes .",
    "universally optimal codes have robust energy minimization properties , which translate into good performance according to a broad range of measures . for example",
    ", they minimize the probability of an undetected error under the @xmath1-ary symmetric channel , provided that each symbol is more likely to remain the same than to become any other fixed symbol .",
    "( see section  v of @xcite . )    for another application , consider maximum - likelihood decoding for a binary - input discrete memoryless channel .",
    "the exact error probability for decoding is subtle , but for relatively low - rate codes it is frequently estimated using a union bound ( see theorem  7.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "this bound shows that the error probability for a random codeword from a code @xmath7 is at most @xmath28 with @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the bhattacharyya parameter . because @xmath31 , the potential function @xmath8 is completely monotonic , and thus a universally optimal code must minimize this upper bound for the decoding error .",
    "it does not necessarily minimize the true decoding error @xcite , but minimizing a useful upper bound is nearly as good .",
    "optimality is by no means limited to this particular union bound .",
    "for example , the same holds true for the awgn channel with antipodal signaling .",
    "( verifying complete monotonicity for the potential function requires a brief inductive proof , but it is not difficult . ) this explains the observations of ferrari and chugg @xcite , who used linear programming bounds to verify that certain hamming and golay codes minimize this bound for a wide range of signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "our results prove that this always works and show how to generalize it to other codes .",
    "we will prove that all the codes listed in table  [ tab : codes ] are universally optimal .",
    "( see the longer version of this paper for a review of the definitions of these codes , as well as other background and discussion removed for lack of space . ) for the hamming , hadamard , golay , mds , and nordstrom - robinson codes , universal optimality is a theorem of ashikhmin and barg @xcite , as mentioned above .",
    "we write @xmath32 to mean @xmath33 and @xmath34 to mean @xmath35 .",
    "the justification numbers in square brackets tell which lemmas or propositions imply lp universal optimality ; when there is no such number , the proof is by directly solving the linear programs .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     universally optimal codes are common for short block lengths , but they become increasingly rare for long block lengths .",
    "brute force searches show that there is a unique universally optimal binary code of size @xmath36 and block length @xmath37 ( up to translation and permutation of the coordinates ) whenever @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for @xmath40 , such a code exists if and only if @xmath41 , and it is unique except when @xmath42 or @xmath43 , in which case there are two isomorphism classes ( see section  [ sec : further ] for an explanation of the @xmath44 symmetry ) . thus , a universal optimum need not exist or be unique if it does exist .",
    "our main technical tool for bounding energy is the linear program developed by delsarte @xcite , which was originally used to bound the size of codes given their minimum distance and was applied to energy minimization and related problems by yudin @xcite and by ashikhmin , barg , and litsyn @xcite .",
    "we will call a code _ lp universally optimal _ if its universal optimality follows from these bounds , as occurs for all the cases in table  [ tab : codes ] .",
    "our most surprising theorem is that lp universally optimal codes continue to minimize energy even after we remove a single codeword .",
    "we know of no continuous analogue of this property .",
    "furthermore , such codes are distance regular ( for each distance , every codeword has the same number of codewords at that distance ) .",
    "[ thm : removept - intro ] every lp universally optimal code is distance regular , and it remains universally optimal when any single codeword is removed .    removing a codeword yields a universal optimum , but the resulting code will generally not be lp universally optimal .",
    "thus , this process can not be iterated .",
    "we begin by formulating the linear programming bound for energy minimization .",
    "suppose @xmath5 .",
    "the delsarte inequalities constrain the _ distance distribution _ @xmath45 of @xmath7 , where @xmath46 specifically , let @xmath47 denote the @xmath48-th krawtchouk polynomial , defined by @xmath49 krawtchouk polynomials are orthogonal polynomials with respect to the binomial distribution @xmath50 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath51    the delsarte inequalities are @xmath52 for @xmath53 ( see theorem  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the following linear program in the variables @xmath54 gives a lower bound for @xmath28 when @xmath55 : @xmath56    a code @xmath5 is _ lp universally optimal _ if its distance distribution @xmath57 optimizes for every completely monotonic potential function @xmath8 .",
    "ashikhmin and barg @xcite call lp universally optimal codes _",
    "extremal codes_.    for any fixed code , checking whether it is universally optimal or lp universally optimal is a finite problem , since we can write down a basis for the cone of completely monotonic functions as follows .",
    "[ lem : cm - basis ] the complete monotonic functions on @xmath58 are the nonnegative span of the _ fundamental potential functions _",
    "@xmath59 defined by @xmath60 .",
    "the potential energy with respect to @xmath61 is exactly the @xmath62-th _ binomial moment _ of the distance distribution , as defined by ashikhmin and barg @xcite .",
    "thus , lemma  [ lem : cm - basis ] shows that a code is universally optimal if and only if its binomial moments are minimal , so the results of @xcite can be restated in terms of universal optimality .",
    "lemma  [ lem : cm - basis ] includes @xmath63 in the domain of @xmath8 , which will be notationally convenient in section  [ sec : quasicodes ] , but we can always extend @xmath8 from @xmath64 to @xmath65 by setting @xmath66 to be a sufficiently large value that complete monotonicity continues to hold .",
    "we say that a function @xmath67 is _ absolutely monotonic _ if all its finite differences are nonnegative ; i.e. , @xmath68 whenever @xmath69 and @xmath17 .    by changing @xmath70 to @xmath71",
    ", it suffices to prove that the functions @xmath72 span the cone of absolutely monotonic functions .",
    "indeed , @xmath73 for @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for @xmath76 , so each @xmath77 is absolutely monotonic .",
    "conversely , every function @xmath78 satisfies @xmath79 by the discrete calculus analogue of the taylor series expansion . if @xmath80 is absolutely monotonic , then @xmath81 for all @xmath62 , as desired .",
    "thus , checking whether a code of block length @xmath37 is lp universally optimal amounts to solving @xmath37 linear programs ( the @xmath82 case is trivial ) .",
    "however , checking whether a code is universally optimal seems far more difficult .",
    "linear programming duality transforms into its dual as follows . here",
    "@xmath83 are the dual variables , and the equality conditions follow from complementary slackness .",

    "furthermore , equality holds if and only if @xmath93 for all @xmath94 satisfying @xmath95 and @xmath96 for all @xmath97 satisfying @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the distance distribution of @xmath7 and @xmath100 is the _ dual distance distribution _ defined by @xmath101",
    "in this section we show that lp universal optimality is preserved under the duality operation expressed by .",
    "curiously , this symmetry seems to have no analogue in the continuous setting of @xcite .",
    "we use the term _ quasicode _ for a feasible point in the delsarte linear program , equipped with a duality operator called the macwilliams transform @xcite .",

    "universally optimal quasicodes often exist in low dimensions ; for example , they exist for all @xmath128 and @xmath39 .",

    "for example , there are no universally optimal quasicodes for @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .    given a quasicode @xmath57 with dual @xmath132 , we call @xmath133 the _ support _ of the quasicode , and @xmath134 the _ dual support _ of the quasicode .",
    "of course we apply the same definitions to actual codes .",
    "proposition  [ prop : lp - bound ] also applies to quasicodes , because its proof used only the delsarte inequalities .",
    "note that the conditions for equality do not take into account the actual values of the quasicode , but only its support and dual support :    [ prop : support - info ] whether a quasicode is universally optimal depends only on its length , size , support , and dual support .",
    "a universally optimal quasicode is uniquely determined by its length and size if it exists , because the energies with respect to the @xmath135 fundamental potential functions put @xmath135 constraints on the quasicode , which are linearly independent because there is one potential function of each degree .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath102 is a universally optimal quasicode and @xmath126 is another quasicode of the same length and size whose support and dual support are respectively contained in those of @xmath102 , then @xmath126 is also universally optimal , since the same @xmath136 that works for @xmath102 also works for @xmath126 .",

    "in this section , we show that removing a single codeword from an lp universally optimal code always yields a universally optimal code .",
    "this surprising fact will follow from a strengthening of the delsarte linear program due to ashikhmin and simonis @xcite .",

    "suppose @xmath295 is not a multiple of @xmath1 .",
    "proposition  [ prop : as ] shows that the dual distance distribution of @xmath7 is strictly positive , and thus the auxiliary function in proposition  [ prop : lp - bound ] must be constant",
    ". then the conclusion follows , because the auxiliary function is less than or equal to @xmath8 everywhere and equal on the support of @xmath7 .",
    "[ cor : multq ] every lp universally optimal code in @xmath4 has size a multiple of @xmath1 unless all pairs of distinct points in the code are at distance @xmath37 .    in the latter case , there can be at most @xmath1 points in the code .",
    "[ prop : removept - f ] let @xmath5 be a code and let @xmath296 be any function ( not necessarily completely monotonic ) such that the delsarte linear programming bounds prove @xmath7 minimizes @xmath8-potential energy .",
    "let @xmath297 .",
    "then @xmath298 for every code @xmath299 with @xmath300 .    by lemma  [ lemma : qmult ]",
    "we may assume that @xmath295 is a multiple of @xmath1 , because the other case in the lemma is trivial .",
    "let @xmath301 , let @xmath302 be the distance distribution of @xmath7 , and let @xmath303 be the expected distance distribution after removing a random codeword from @xmath7 .",
    "given @xmath304 with @xmath305 , the probability that neither will be removed is @xmath306 .",
    "thus , @xmath307 while for @xmath308 , @xmath309 under this relationship between @xmath310 and @xmath311 , the delsarte inequalities @xmath52 simply say @xmath312 and hence are equivalent to @xmath313 the key observation underlying the proof is that these inequalities on @xmath314 are exactly the ashikhmin - simonis inequalities from proposition  [ prop : as ] ; i.e. , @xmath99 satisfies the delsarte inequalities if and only if @xmath314 satisfies the ashikhmin - simonis inequalities .",
    "thus , our hypothesis that @xmath99 minimizes the @xmath8-potential energy @xmath315 among nonnegative vectors subject to the delsarte inequalities , @xmath316 , and @xmath317 implies that @xmath314 minimizes the expected energy @xmath318 subject to the ashikhmin - simonis inequalities , @xmath307 , and @xmath319 .",
    "the ashikhmin - simonis inequalities apply to all codes of size @xmath320 , because @xmath36 is a multiple of @xmath1 and hence @xmath320 is not .",
    "this means no code of size @xmath320 in @xmath4 can have lower @xmath8-potential energy than the expected energy after removing a random codeword from @xmath7 .",
    "removing different codewords might yield non - isomorphic codes , but by linearity of expectation they must all have the same energy , since none of them can have lower energy than the average .",
    "it follows that for every @xmath297 , the code @xmath321 minimizes @xmath8-potential energy among all codes of size @xmath322 .",
    "in particular , by letting @xmath8 vary over all completely monotonic functions , we see that if @xmath7 is lp universally optimal , then @xmath321 is universally optimal for all @xmath297 .",
    "all of these codes @xmath321 must have the same distance distribution , since they have the same energy for all completely monotonic potential functions , which span the space of all potential functions .",
    "thus @xmath7 must be distance regular .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ thm : removept - intro ] .",
    "we find the result quite surprising , and the role of the ashikhmin - simonis inequalities in the proof is mysterious .",
    "it is natural to look for other proofs of these inequalities .",
    "there is a much simpler proof for binary codes ( theorem  5 in @xcite ) , which we have been able to generalize to alphabets of prime power order but no further .",
    "the elegant proof of the delsarte inequalities in @xcite can also be adapted to give a proof of the ashikhmin - simonis inequalities , but in fact there is an error in @xcite : equation ( @xmath323 ) is incorrect and the map @xmath324 is not well defined for a general alphabet .",
    "when the alphabet has prime power order , the proof works , but we see no way to salvage it in general .",
    "in the introduction we mentioned a @xmath44 symmetry for codes of size @xmath36 in @xmath325 .",
    "the unoccupied locations in a code @xmath5 can be viewed as antiparticles , which are subject to exactly the same forces as the original particles : @xmath326 by a simple inclusion - exclusion argument ( see also section  1.3.4 of @xcite for an essentially equivalent lemma ) .",
    "thus , @xmath327 is universally optimal if and only if @xmath7 is .",
    "linear programming bounds do not respect this antiparticle symmetry .",
    "for codes of size greater than @xmath328 in @xmath4 , passing to the complement can strengthen the delsarte bounds , while for codes of size at most @xmath328 one can show that this yields no improvement . of course , few important codes have size greater than @xmath328 .    beyond linear programming bounds and antiparticle symmetry , are there systematic techniques that could be applied ?",
    "semidefinite programming bounds @xcite are the most powerful approach known to proving coding theory bounds . they have been applied to potential energy minimization in projective space @xcite , but we have not investigated them in @xmath4 .    many of our results generalize straightforwardly to metric and cometric association schemes , i.e. , distance - regular graphs under the graph metric with the `` @xmath329-polynomial '' property @xcite .",
    "there are several noteworthy omissions , namely the theory of duality ( including the definition of the dual quasicode and proposition  [ prop : quasicode - duality ] ) and the results of section  [ sec : remove ] . however , the results of sections  [ sec : construct ] and  [ sec : criteria ] all generalize if @xmath264 is replaced with the average distance between a pair of randomly selected points in the graph , with the exception of lemma  [ lem : pd - mds ] ( which is needed only for mds codes ) and proposition  [ prop : uo-3sup ] .",
    "the proofs are essentially identical .",
    "we have not attempted to compile an exhaustive list of examples for this more general theory , along the lines of table  [ tab : codes ] , but there are several interesting applications .",
    "for example , consider the johnson space of binary vectors of length @xmath37 and weight @xmath330 .",
    "every projective plane of order @xmath1 yields an @xmath331 steiner system and thus a configuration of @xmath332 points in the johnson space with parameters @xmath333 .",
    "this configuration is a simplex and a @xmath266-design , so it is universally optimal .",
    "the @xmath334 steiner system is a somewhat deeper example .",
    "the role of duality in association scheme theory is well understood ( see section  2.6 in @xcite ) , and it does not generalize to arbitrary metric and cometric association schemes . however , the results of section  [ sec : remove ] are far more mysterious , and we have no idea how far they might generalize .",
    "in particular , we have no conceptual explanation for why proposition  [ prop : as ] turns out to be exactly what we require to analyze removing one point from an lp universal optimum .",
    "any progress on generalizing either the results or the proof techniques to other association schemes would be exciting .",
