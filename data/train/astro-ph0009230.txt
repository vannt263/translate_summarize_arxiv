    "the galaxy luminosity function is one of the most direct observational probes of galaxy formation theories .",
    "hierarchical clustering models generically predict a steep mass function of galactic halos that is in conflict with the field galaxy luminosity function ( _ e.g. _ kauffmann 1993 , cole 1994 ) .",
    "the discrepancy is resolved by invoking feedback mechanisms to suppress star - formation and darken dwarf galaxies .",
    "clusters of galaxies provide the ideal systems with which to measure the galaxy luminosity function down to very faint magnitudes due to the large numbers of galaxies at the same distance that can be observed within a small area on the sky ( schechter 1976 ) .    measuring the faint end luminosity function (",
    "hereafter lf ) of galaxies in clusters has been the subject of many detailed research papers in the last few years ( _ e.g. _ sandage , binggeli & tammann 1985 ; driver 1994 , de propris 1995 ; gaidos 1997 ; lobo 1997 ; lumsden 1997 ; lopez - cruz 1997 ; valotto et el .",
    "1997 ; wilson 1997 ; smith 1997 ; gaidos 1998 , trentham 1998a ; trentham 1998b ; driver 1998 ; garilli 1999 ) . in most of these studies , these and other authors have demonstrated using background subtraction procedures that galaxy clusters are dominated in number by a large population of faint galaxies . in terms of the faint end slope of the luminosity function",
    ", @xmath8 lies in the range -1.4 to -2.0 .",
    "the nature of these galaxies , their origin and evolution have important consequences for our current understanding of galaxy formation and the importance of environment in driving morphological evolution .",
    "these results are at odds with observations of the field galaxy luminosity function ( _ e.g. _ loveday 1992 ; lin 1997 ; marzke 1997 ; bromley 1998 , muriel 1998 ) which ubiquitously give a flat faint end slope with @xmath9 .",
    "in other recent works , steeper lf are found ( @xmath10 ) zuca 1997 , folkes 1999 , although significantly flatter than the determinations in clusters .",
    "moreover , galaxies within the local group can be observed to more than 10 magnitudes below @xmath11 , the characteristic break in the schechter luminosity function ( schechter 1976 ) .",
    "surveys of local group galaxies are essentially complete ( mateo 1998 ) and there is no evidence for a large population of faint dwarfs - the luminosity function is flat to @xmath12 ( van den bergh 1992 , pritchet & van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "the probability that the faint end slope in the local group is as steep as 1.3 is less than 1% .",
    "similarly , redshift surveys of nearby loose groups ( ferguson & sandage 1990 ) , compact groups ( hunsberger 1998 ) and isolated ellipticals ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1999 ) also show evidence for flat faint end slopes ( but see also morgan 1998 ) .",
    "the paradox is clear . in the hierarchical universe ,",
    "clusters form relatively recently from the accretion of systems similar to the local group .",
    "dynamical processes that operate in clusters are destructive . ram pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 , abadi , moore & bower 1999 ) and gravitational tides / galaxy harassment ( _ e.g. _ moore 1996 ) both conspire to fade galaxies by removing gas or stripping stars . these process are most effective for smaller , less bound galaxies , which should manifest itself as a _ flattening _ of the faint end slope rather than the observed steepening .",
    "surface brightness selection effects complicate these issues . apart from the local group ,",
    "all of the above surveys are sensitive only to high surface brightness galaxies .",
    "decreasing the limiting isophote for galaxy detection to @xmath13 mag arcsec@xmath14 uncovers a host of previously undetected galaxies ( impey & bothun 1997 ) . within nearby clusters , such as virgo and fornax , a divergent exponential tail to the galaxy luminosity function can not be ruled out ( impey etal 1988 , bothun etal 1991 ) .",
    "a similar situation arises in the field surveys where we know comparatively little about the abundance of low surface brightness objects .",
    "the observational motivation for this paper are the observations of high surface brightness galaxies , but our results will be applicable to any survey where the clusters are selected from 2 dimensional data .    unlike clusters which provide a large sample of galaxies at the same distance , the field galaxy luminosity function must be determined using redshift information . even with the advent of large multi - fibre instruments , the luminosity function of cluster galaxies has not been measured out to the virial radius , nor has it been measured to faint enough magnitudes to constrain the faint end slope - both vital for comparison with cosmological models .",
    "the lack of large compilations of redshifts of faint galaxies imply that most estimates of galaxy luminosity functions in clusters rely critically on background subtraction .",
    "the accuracy of this procedure depends on the statistical assumption that galaxy clusters correspond to density enhancements unbiased with respect to the distribution of foreground or background galaxies .    in spite of the lack of deep redshift surveys free from incompletness and selection effects",
    "several groups have attempted to determine the shape of the galaxy luminosity function from spectroscopic data in cluster fields . by inspection of these papers",
    ", it is apparent that flatter faint end slopes are found over the range of magnitudes where the redshift samples are complete .",
    "for instance , spectroscopic analysis of the central region of the coma cluster shows a flat faint end galaxy lf ( @xmath15 ) for a single schechter function fit , with the additional claim of a failure of a single schechter fit at brighter magnitudes @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( biviano et al .",
    "1995 ) . similarly , koranyi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have analyzed a redshift survey in the field of the poor cluster awm 7 . in this case",
    ", the galaxy lf shows a steeper faint end ( @xmath18 ) , although this value is based on a correction to the redshift data that entirely dominates the results at faint magnitudes .",
    "a similar analysis of a2626 and a2440 by mohr , geller and wegner ( 1996 ) gives faint end slopes @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( 90% confidence limits ) respectively .",
    "the study of a576 by mohr et al ( 1996 ) also gives a flat galaxy lf in the range of magnitudes where the redshift survey is complete , however it steepens significantly at fainter magnitudes where a background correction is applied .",
    "the most complete published redshift survey of a cluster has been published by durret et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for a496 .",
    "these authors show that the lf flattens at @xmath21 , where the sample is complete , and at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath22 ) , a schechter function with @xmath23 , provides a suitable fit to the lf with @xmath24 redshift completness . in a study of the galaxy lf from the norris survey of the corona borealis and a2069 supercluster regions with spectroscopic information , small et al .",
    "( 1997 ) derive a flat faint end lf ( @xmath15 ) consistent with the field determination .",
    "finally , adami et al . ( 1999 ) analysis of spectroscopic data in the core of coma cluster imply that the number of low luminosity galaxies is smaller than expected from previous estimates ( biviano et al .",
    "1995 ) , suggesting a flat faint end galaxy lf .    to summarise",
    ", galaxy lf determinations using spectroscopic data suggest that the steep faint end slope derived from background subtraction procedures should be taken with caution .",
    "however , the spectroscopic surveys are only complete to approximately 2 magnitudes fainter than m * whereas the photometric surveys can probe 7 magnitudes fainter than m*.    significant projection effects are found in abell clusters ( e.g. lucey 1983 , sutherland 1988 , frenk 1990 ) that can systematically bias the observed correlation function and the mass function of these systems .",
    "in fact , van haarlem ( 1998 ) find that a third of abell clusters are not real physically bound systems but simply projections of galaxies and groups along the line of sight . in this paper",
    "we use 3 dimensional mock galaxy catalogues to construct samples of rich clusters using just 2 dimensional information . observing these clusters in the same way as published works allows us to quantify how well we can recover the true luminosity function .",
    "we will explore the biases due to foreground and background contamination , the dependence of the results on cluster richness , and the effects of the extended halos of clusters .",
    "mock galaxy catalogues constructed from large n - body simulations provide ideal data - sets with which to examine selection biases since the full 3d positional and velocity information is available .",
    "we have used a deep galaxy catalogue kindly constructed by shaun cole that is a mock realisation of the apm catalogue .",
    "the n - body simulation and techniques used to construct the catalogues are discussed in detail in cole ( 1998 ) , here we just review some of the most relevant details .",
    "the n - body simulation follows a universe dominated with a closure density of cold dark matter within a periodic box of 345.6 @xmath25 mpc per side ( where @xmath26 km s@xmath27 mpc@xmath27 throughout ) .",
    "the simulation is normalised to match the observed number density of rich galaxy clusters such that @xmath28 .",
    "`` galaxies '' are drawn from the mass distribution according to a two parameter biasing model normalised to fit the observed r.m.s .",
    "fluctuations in the apm catalogue in cubes of side 5 and 20 mpc / h .",
    "thus , even though the initial n - body simulation is not the currently favoured cosmological model , both the amplitude and slope of the `` galaxy '' correlation function provide a close match to that obtained from the apm survey .",
    "therefore , we do not expect our results to change if the cosmological model included a lambda term , as currently favoured .",
    "this is of course an important point since projection effects may depend on the degree of galaxy clustering present in the mock catalogue .",
    "moreover , since the correlations between cluster and galaxy positions are crucial in the present discussion , we have computed the cross - correlation function for clusters and `` galaxies '' in the mock catalogs as well as the cluster autocorrelation function .",
    "the results show reasonable agreement with the observations , lilje & efstathiou ( 1988 ) , croft et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , dalton , abadi , muriel lambas ( 1998 )    ( @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) indicating that the statistical properties of the galaxy distribution around the clusters in the mock catalog are in good agreement with the observations .",
    "thus , for the purpose of our analysis the mock catalog used provides a suitable representation of the real universe so that the results derived in this section are robust and not expected to change with other cosmological models that match the observations .",
    "the luminosities of the galaxies are drawn at random according to a schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) , unbiased with respect to environment : @xmath31^{1+\\alpha }   \\exp[-10^{0.4(m^*-m)}].\\ ] ] we adopt the values @xmath32 , @xmath33=-19.5 and @xmath8=-0.97 corresponding to the luminosity function of high surface brightness field galaxies ( loveday 1992 ) . the limiting apparent magnitude for the mock catalogue ( which subtends @xmath34 square degrees )",
    "is @xmath35 and the final catalogues contain @xmath36 comparable to those in the apm galaxy survey ( maddox 1990a , 1990b ) and edinburgh / durham southern galaxy catalogue ( heydon - dumbleton , collins , & macgillivray 1989 ) .      we have selected the clusters from the mock catalogue applying a similar procedure as lumsden ( 1992 ) in the construction of the edinburgh - durham cluster catalogue ( edcc ) .",
    "this corresponds closely to abell s original criteria ( abell 1958 ) .",
    "first , we project the galaxy catalogue on the sky and find cluster centers by searching for galaxy overdensities .",
    "the _ redshift _ distance of the cluster candidate is measured using the real velocities of the brightest galaxies in the apparent cluster .",
    "we then adopt a @xmath37 mpc search radius around these centers and we consider galaxies within this radius in the range of magnitudes @xmath38 to @xmath39 to define cluster richness in a similar way to abell and edcc cluster identification procedures .",
    "( note that using this method to determine cluster richness and distances reflects current techniques , rather than abell s original method that assumed the apparent magnitude of the 10th brightest cluster galaxy was a standard candle . )",
    "the final sample of clusters for our analysis comprises 140 objects with redshifts @xmath40 .",
    "we find that the typical redshift distributions in the field of the identified clusters in the simulations are visually comparable to the observed distribution of radial velocities measured for clusters .",
    "an example is shown in figure 1 where we compare the redshift distribution of a typical cluster selected in two dimensions , panels ( a ) and ( c ) , with the redshift distribution of galaxies in the field of a cluster selected in three dimensions with no two dimensional counterpart ( see section 2.5 ) .",
    "both contain a significant peak of galaxies at one distance that corresponds to a real cluster , but in the 2-dim case smaller peaks are found at disparate redshifts that are simply groups of galaxies that lie in projection along the line of sight to the cluster . in the absence of redshifts for all the galaxies in the field ,",
    "these groups provide a significant source of contamination for the cluster membership .",
    "we estimate the mean galaxy luminosity function for the total sample of clusters using only the apparent magnitudes of galaxies and mean cluster redshifts  the same as published observational studies . for a galaxy of apparent magnitude @xmath41 associated with a cluster at redshift @xmath42",
    ", we neglect curvature and assign an absolute magnitude @xmath43 where d is @xmath44 . the algorithm to determine the composite luminosity function ( valotto 1997 , lumsden 1997 , muriel 1998 ) in the absence of galaxy radial velocities",
    "is based on a background subtraction procedure :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the composite luminosity function in the magnitude bin centered in @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the background - corrected number of galaxies with magnitude @xmath47 of the _ i_th cluster .",
    "@xmath49 is the richness count of the _ i_th cluster in the range of magnitudes @xmath50 within the projected radius @xmath51 h@xmath27mpc and @xmath52 is the number of clusters contributing to the composite luminosity function .    in order to explore the galaxy lf at faint absolute magnitudes",
    "we compute the composite lf for the nearest 22 clusters with redshift @xmath53 , using galaxies brighter than @xmath54 .",
    "the background de - contamination is performed by considering a mean local background around each cluster defined as the number of galaxies in a ring at projected radius @xmath55 .",
    "the results shown in figure 2 correspond to @xmath56 mpc and @xmath57 mpc .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting galaxy luminosity function in the simulated clusters , the solid lines correspond to a best fitting schechter function estimated using a minimum @xmath58 method .",
    "the dotted lines correspond to the imposed schechter function ( equation 1 ) .",
    "the errors bars are calculated according to poisson statistics .",
    "the estimated galaxy lf is significantly steeper @xmath59 and @xmath60 than the actual lf @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "when we take a deeper sample of clusters surveyed to fainter magnitudes ( @xmath63 ) we find an even steeper faint end slope @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    ".      can we detect any trends in how the recovered luminosity function depends on the limiting radius used to identify clusters or the cluster richness ?",
    "smaller radii would probe higher overdensities and would reduce the chance of background contamination . in figure 3",
    "we show the results corresponding to model 1 for @xmath66 h@xmath27mpc , @xmath67 h@xmath27mpc and @xmath68 h@xmath27mpc .",
    "this figure shows a similar behavior , with steeper faint end slopes than expected , although fits to a schechter function show a tendency for lower values of @xmath8 with decreasing cluster radius ( _ c.f .",
    "_ table 1 ) .    in order to examine any possible dependence of the results with cluster richness we have divided the cluster samples according to their richness counts , @xmath69 , defined in equation 2 . in figure 4",
    "we show the results for the samples of different @xmath69 and we detect a trend of increasing negative slope as poorer clusters are included .      for each cluster",
    "we have considered galaxies within 1000 kms@xmath27 of the cluster mean radial velocity from the mock catalogue to compute the galaxy lf . since in this case we eliminate any projection effects , this tests the procedures adopted to obtain the lf .",
    "the results for model 1 are shown in panel ( c ) of figure 5 , where for comparison we plot the imposed lf .",
    "the agreement between the input data and the sample of real cluster galaxies is , as expected , very good ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we can easily examine if the systematic rise in the derived galaxy lf shown in figure 2 is mainly due to foreground or to background contamination .",
    "we split the sample of cluster galaxies ( identified in projection from model 1 ) into two : a ) for each cluster we consider only galaxies with radial velocities @xmath70 ( thus considering only foreground contamination ) and b ) @xmath71 ( thus considering only background contamination ) . when we repeat the procedure to recover the lf , i.e. applying the same de - contamination procedures described to the foreground case @xmath72 , we find a flat galaxy lf , entirely consistent with that originally imposed to create the galaxy catalogue . on the other hand ,",
    "a significantly steeper lf is derived by considering galaxies with @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) consistent with that obtained from the total mock catalogue ( see figure 2 and table 1 ) .",
    "the results of these tests are shown in figure 5 , which demonstrate that the artificial steep faint end slopes arises entirely due to projection of background galaxies into the field of view of the cluster .",
    "the observed distribution of galaxies closely matches the clustering pattern of galaxies in our mock catalogues .",
    "we can therefore test the role of large scale correlations and the filamentary structure of the galaxy distribution in creating projection effects .",
    "we construct a spherically symmetric model cluster that resembles real bound objects in the mock catalogue .",
    "thirteen clusters are added to the galaxy catalogue but place in random positions with distances drawn from the same the redshift distribution and with @xmath75 .",
    "these clusters are therefore uncorrelated with the large scale structure .",
    "we repeat the procedure to estimate the lf using the fake clusters and we show the results in figure 6 .",
    "remarkably , for these clusters we recover the input luminosity function with good precision , again demonstrating that projection effects are dominating the bias .",
    "we have identified clusters in 3 dimensions using the real space positions of galaxies in the mock catalogues of the two models .",
    "we consider galaxies limited in apparent magnitude @xmath76 within a radial distance of @xmath77 mpc which corresponds to a complete sample brighter than @xmath78 . to identify clusters in this three dimensional catalogue , we use a friends - of - friends algorithm with linking length @xmath79 mpc .",
    "we select the most massive systems corresponding to a mean number density of @xmath80 , roughly the abundance of @xmath81 abell clusters .",
    "we compute the galaxy lf in these samples of clusters using the same background subtraction procedures as in section 2.3 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 7 demonstrating that the clusters selected in 3d can be used to recover the input luminosity function .",
    "the schechter fit of the galaxy lf of the 3 dim cluster sample has parameters , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( table 1 ) .",
    "when we compare the richness of the 2d selected clusters with the largest physically selected 3d cluster along the same line of sight we find a large scatter , with the richness count typically in error by a factor of 2 .      in the previous sections",
    "we have demonstrated the importance of the correlation between cluster and galaxy positions in the determination of the galaxy lf parameters in these systems .",
    "taking into account these results we now consider the effects of the extended halos of clusters on the background subtraction procedure .",
    "the virialised halos of clusters extend to several mpc and the turnaround region is much larger than this .",
    "this produces an excess of galaxies near to the cluster that appear in projection , on the cluster core .",
    "a `` malmquist '' like bias will cause foreground galaxies to be preferentially `` observed in the cluster '' .",
    "the estimated luminosity function @xmath84 satisfies : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the absolute magnitude of each galaxy assumed to be at the mean cluster redshift .",
    "the distances in the calculation satisfy : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the distance between the galaxy to the cluster center , @xmath69 is the distance of the galaxy to the observer , @xmath89 is the distance of the cluster to the observer and @xmath90 is the projected distance galaxy - cluster center .",
    "@xmath91 is the true galaxy luminosity function for which we adopt a schechter function with the same parameters as for our mock catalogue and @xmath92 is the cluster - galaxy cross - correlation function .",
    "we adopt a power - law model for the cluster - galaxy cross - correlation function with parameters @xmath93 mpc , @xmath94 and an effective cutoff at @xmath95 mpc which provides a reasonable fit to the observations ( lilje & efstathiou 1988 , merchan 1998 ) .",
    "the results for a typical cluster at @xmath96 mpc and @xmath97 are @xmath98 and @xmath99 indicating that the extended cluster halos of clusters do not bias the resulting lf at the faint end .",
    "this calculation shows that the effect of extended halos is mainly to increase the estimated value of @xmath100 by the inclusion of foreground galaxies .",
    "we have analyzed several sources of systematic effects present in observational determinations of the galaxy luminosity function in clusters .",
    "we use a deep mock catalogue derived from a numerical simulation of a hierarchical universe models dominated by cold dark matter to identify clusters of galaxies in two dimensions .",
    "galaxies and clusters in the mock catalog have auto - correlations and cross - correlation functions in agreement with the observations so that the distribution of galaxies and clusters relative to the position of clusters resemble those actually observed .",
    "this fact provides confidence that our analyses on the mock catalog gives reliable results that apply to the real universe .",
    "the clusters are identified in projection from the galaxy distribution in a similar way as performed to create the eddc and abell catalogues .",
    "the galaxy lf in the clusters is obtained by performing a background subtraction procedure identical to that applied to observational data .",
    "our results are summarised here :    @xmath101  clusters identified in projection suffer from projection effects that conspire to produce artificially steep faint end slopes , mimicking the presence of a large population of dwarf galaxies . with an input schechter function with a slope",
    "@xmath61 we recover @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath101  we show that the projection effects result almost entirely from background galaxies - many of the clusters selected in 2d have no significant counterpart in 3d and most suffer from massive amounts of projection that is responsible for the steep faint end slopes .",
    "@xmath101  unbiased estimates of mean galaxy luminosity function in clusters may be obtained with background subtraction methods only for samples of clusters selected in three dimensions , such as may be obtained from an x - ray or lensing selected sample .",
    "@xmath101  we examined the effects of the extended halos and infall regions surrounding clusters on the background subtraction procedure . neglecting these effects leads to a bias in the determination of @xmath33 to brighter magnitudes , but do not affect the estimation of the faint end slope @xmath8 .",
    "these results indicate that caution should be taken when interpreting the observed steep faint end of the lf with a large population of faint galaxies associated with cluster environments - radial velocity data for cluster galaxies are crucial for analyzing their faint galaxy populations and typically half of the apparent cluster galaxies will be background objects .",
    "we note that abell , edcc , and apm clusters exhibit on average a steep galaxy lf with @xmath103 to @xmath104 , ( valotto 1997 ; lumsden 1997 ) , showing that the particular choice of cluster finding algorithms in two dimensional catalogues is not biasing the resulting lf . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed mean galaxy lf of groups that avoid cluster neighborhoods is found to be quite flat ( muriel , valotto and lambas 1998 ) which suggest that either clusters have a contaminated galaxy lf or that the relative excess of faint galaxies arises at very high densities .",
    "we also note here that the galaxy lf is steep in irregular systems ( lopez - cruz 1997 ) and flat in dense relaxed clusters , a result supported by recent spectroscopic observations in the coma cluster core ( adami et al .",
    "the mounting evidence of flat galaxy lf results from spectroscopic surveys with reasonable completeness adds to the above considerations , and we suggest that irregular clusters may owe their irregularity to projection effects which bias the lf to steeper slopes .",
    "our results support the idea of a similar galaxy luminosity function in clusters and the field .",
