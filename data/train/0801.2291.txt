    "@xmath51 ( without any periodicity assumption on @xmath83 ) , the lp follows directly from the estimate on the oscillation of weak solutions proved by de giorgi in the celebrated paper @xcite .",
    "another classical way to derive the lp is by applying the harnack inequality in the balls @xmath84 , provided that one can bound the constants uniformly with respect to @xmath85 .",
    "this has been done by gilbarg and serrin @xcite for the equation @xmath86 , with @xmath87 converging to constants as @xmath88 .",

    "their result applies in particular to the equation when @xmath0 , @xmath98identity and @xmath99constant , with a suitable rate , as @xmath100 .",

    "this result is a particular case of part ( ii ) above and , since when @xmath51 there is no difference between studying bounded solutions and positive bounded solutions , it contains the case 1 ) of corollary [ cor : liouville ] when one restricts it to elliptic equations ( except for the fact that some stronger regularity assumptions are required in @xcite ) .",
    "another related topic is that of the characterization of polynomial growing solutions of periodic equations in the whole space .",
    "we stress out that the lp - as intended in the present paper - is obtained as a particular case considering polynomials of degree zero . in that framework , using some homogenization techniques , avellaneda and lin @xcite , and later moser and struwe @xcite , proved that the lp holds for if @xmath51 and the @xmath83 are periodic ( with the same period ) .",

    "the restriction to bounded solutions of theorem 28 part 3 in @xcite is equivalent to the restriction to stationary solutions of statements ( ii ) and ( iii ) of here .",

    "as emphasized in @xcite , some authors made use in proofs of the claim that any bounded solution in @xmath13 of a second order linear elliptic equation with a.  p.  coefficients has to be a.  p. this claim is false , as shown by counterexample [ c - e ] and also by a counterexample in @xcite .",

    "then , the result follows from part ( iii ) .    in sections [ sec : omega ] ,",
    "we derive results analogous to theorems [ thm:1per ] and [ thm : per ] for the dirichlet and the robin problems in periodic domains .",

    "let us preliminarily reclaim the notion of periodic  and eigenfunction .",

    "<S> this paper is concerned with some extensions of the classical liouville theorem for bounded harmonic functions to solutions of more general equations . </S>",
    "<S> we deal with entire solutions of periodic and almost periodic parabolic equations including the elliptic framework as a particular case . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a liouville type result for periodic operators as a consequence of a result for operators periodic in just one variable , which is new even in the elliptic case . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we show that if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are periodic in the same space direction or in time , with the same period , then any bounded solution @xmath2 of @xmath3 is periodic in that direction or in time . </S>",
    "<S> we then derive the following liouville type result : if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are periodic in all the space / time variables , with the same periods , then the space of bounded solutions of the above equation has at most dimension one . in the case of the equation @xmath6 , with @xmath7 periodic elliptic operator independent of @xmath8 , the hypothesis @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> can be weaken by requiring that the periodic  @xmath9 of @xmath10 is nonnegative . instead , the periodicity assumption can not be relaxed , because we explicitly exhibit an almost periodic function @xmath11 such that the space of bounded solutions of @xmath12 in @xmath13 has dimension 2 , and it is generated by the constant solution and a non - almost periodic solution .    </S>",
    "<S> the above counter - example leads us to consider the following problem : under which conditions are bounded solutions necessarily almost periodic ? we show that a sufficient condition in the case of the equation @xmath6 is : @xmath14 almost periodic and @xmath7 periodic with @xmath15 .    finally , we consider problems in general periodic domains under either dirichlet or robin boundary conditions . </S>",
