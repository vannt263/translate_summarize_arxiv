    "a photometric redshift ( photo-@xmath2 ) is derived from the colors and morphology of an object , rather than from its spectrum .",
    "since the bandwidth of an imaging filter is typically @xmath3   while that of a spectroscopic exposure is more like @xmath4 110  , it is much faster to obtain an image than to take a spectrum , and thus photometric redshift determination has the potential for determining reasonably accurate redshifts for large numbers of objects with a minimum of telescope time . in recent years",
    ", this technique has been applied to galaxies with great success ( e.g. , brunner et  al .",
    "1997 ; connolly et  al . 1999 ; mobasher et  al . 2004",
    "; bentez et  al .",
    "2004 ) as a result of the strong , discontinuous features found in the spectra of galaxies , such as the 4000   break , which cause galaxy colors to change substantially with redshift .",
    "high - redshift quasars have a similar discontinuity as a result of hydrogen absorption blueward of ly@xmath5 emission ( i.e. , the ly@xmath5 forest ; 1971 ) that allows for rough determination of their redshifts from broad - band photometry ( e.g. , cristiani et  al . 2004 ) .",
    "lower redshift quasars lack such a strong discontinuity in optical bands , but structure in the color - redshift relation caused by strong emission lines can be used to determine accurate photometric redshifts if the errors in the photometry are sufficiently small",
    ".    early attempts at determining photometric redshifts for quasars are described by , mathez , & pell ' o ( 2000 ) and ( 2001 )  demonstrating a success rate of roughly 50% ( within @xmath6 ) for a few dozen quasars .",
    "the 17-filter combo-17 survey has had more success  identifying 192 @xmath7 quasars with an expected photometric redshift accuracy of @xmath8 ( wolf et  al .",
    "( 2001b ) and ( 2001 ) described two techniques for determining photometric redshift of quasars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; 2000 ) imaging data . in this paper",

    "section  [ chap : summary ] summarizes our work .",
    "this work , rw01 , and ( 2001 ) determine photometric redshifts for quasars by taking advantage of the quantity and quality of the imaging data from the sdss .",
    "the sdss obtains imaging data using a wide - field multi - ccd camera ( gunn et  al .",
    "1998 ) with five broad bands ( @xmath9 ; 1996 ) . the photometric calibration of these data is described by ( 2001 ) , ( 2002 ) , and ( 2002 ) .",
    "throughout this work we use point - spread - function `` asinh '' magnitudes ( lupton , gunn , & szalay 1999 ) that have been corrected for galactic reddening ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) .",
    "( 2002 ) present the quasar selection algorithm , while ( 2003 ) present the most recent catalog of bona - fide sdss quasars .",
    "the sdss s tiling algorithm and astrometric accuracy are described by ( 2003 ) and ( 2003 ) , respectively .",
    "further details related to data releases one ( dr1 ) and two ( dr2 ) can be found in ( 2003 ) and ( 2004 ) .",
    "the 2625 quasars used in rw01 and ( 2001 ) were not chosen with one uniform quasar - selection algorithm ( the quasar selection procedure was under development at the time ) , but all of the objects had spectra as well as sdss photometry . the empirical photometric redshift algorithm applied by rw01 minimized the @xmath10 between the observed and median colors of quasars as a function of redshift .",
    "it correctly predicted the redshifts of 55% of the objects to within 0.1 , and 70% to within 0.2 , a significant advance compared to previous work on this subject  both in sample size and accuracy .",
    "rw01 pointed out some problem areas for future work on their algorithm . ``",
    "reddened quasars '' ( see 2003 and 2004 ) usually had incorrect photometric redshifts .",
    "objects with an extended morphology also were more likely to yield incorrect redshift predictions .",
    "in addition , it was found that quasars at certain specific redshifts below 2.2 had nearly identical colors ( `` color - redshift degeneracies '' ) , where the photometric redshift algorithm would sometimes select the incorrect value .",
    "rw01 discussed some improvements ( e.g. , weighting by redshift and assigning probabilities to the photometric redshifts ) that could be made to the algorithm .",
    "this paper describes some of those improvements .",
    "the photometric redshift tests in rw01 were performed with quasars whose redshifts were already spectroscopically known , but of course the ultimate goal is to apply the technique to quasar candidates that do not have spectra .",
    "two solutions to the problem of accounting for non - quasars in the sample were suggested in rw01 .",
    "first , it might be possible to differentiate between quasars and non - quasars using their photometric redshifts ; perhaps most non - quasars would be assigned redshifts within a few narrow ranges that could be excluded a posteriori .",
    "herein we test the accuracy of this suggestion .",
    "second , it might be possible to select specific regions in color - space that have very high efficiency in quasar selection .",
    "we test this suggestion for a small sample of objects from the sdss early data release ( edr ; 2002 ) database , while ( 2004 ) describes a more powerful selection algorithm ( in terms of completeness and efficiency of quasar selection ) using a much larger sample from the dr1 database .",
    "suppose we have two sets of quasars , designated as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "those in set @xmath11 have spectra , so we know each one s redshift , @xmath13 .",
    "we also have photometry for these quasars , as measured by the sloan digital sky survey : five magnitudes @xmath14 , and their one - sigma uncertainties @xmath15 .",
    "the quasars in the other set , @xmath12 , have no spectra , only photometry . our goal is to obtain photometric redshifts @xmath16 for each of the quasars in @xmath12 .",
    "there are two primary steps to our algorithm .",
    "first one must construct an empirical color - redshift relation ( czr ) using set @xmath11 .",
    "then one uses this czr to assign photometric redshifts to each of the quasars in @xmath12 .",
    "we give the details of these steps below ( using the quasars of the edr catalog for set @xmath11 ) .",
    "to begin , we sort the quasars of @xmath11 into @xmath17 redshift bins . as in rw01 , we chose bins with centers at intervals of 0.05 in redshift , and widths of 0.075 for @xmath18 , 0.2 for @xmath19 , and 0.5 for @xmath20 .",
    "the bins overlap , and become wider for higher redshift , in order to maintain enough quasars in each bin .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , we plot the sdss colors of the edr quasars as functions of spectroscopic redshift .",
    "most quasars in a particular redshift bin have very similar colors , and it is this color - redshift relation that we wish to parameterize . however , there are a small fraction of quasars  plotted with black pluses  whose colors are significantly redder than they should be ( compared to other quasars at the same redshift ) , especially in @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we call these outliers to the czr `` reddened quasars '' since they appear to be reddened by internal dust extinction ( richards et  al",
    ". 2003 ) . to prevent these quasars from skewing the czr to the red",
    ", we exclude them from @xmath11 before constructing the czr .      in this work , we defined reddened quasars using @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "our reasoning was as follows : figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows that @xmath21 colors can be significantly reddened . however , the uncertainties in @xmath21 are often quite large , due to the large uncertainties in sdss @xmath23 magnitudes .",
    "thus , we set a further constraint that reddened quasars should also be fairly red in @xmath22 , the color that is second - most affected by the reddening . if a quasar s @xmath21 color is redder than 97.5% of the other quasars in the same redshift bin , and its @xmath22 color is redder than the median @xmath22 color for its redshift bin , then we consider it to be a reddened quasar , and exclude it from set @xmath11 .",
    "recently , ( 2003 ) have shown that a more effective method for isolating reddened quasars is to make a cut on @xmath24 : the @xmath25 color relative to the mean @xmath25 color at that redshift .",
    "in addition it may not be necessary to exclude reddened quasars at all if modal colors ( hopkins et al .",
    "2004 ) are used to determine the czr , since these colors should be unaffected by reddened outliers .",
    "we may alter our algorithm in the future to take these developments into account , but our definition of reddened quasars suffices for our purposes .",
    "now that we have excluded the most heavily reddened quasars , we use the remaining quasars in set @xmath11 to construct the czr . in what follows , the index @xmath26 will refer to the redshift bins .",
    "let @xmath27 be the number of non - reddened quasars in the @xmath28 redshift bin ; then the index @xmath29 ranges over the non - reddened quasars in that bin .    using the colors of the quasars in the @xmath28 bin",
    ", we calculate the mean color vector @xmath30 and the color covariance matrix @xmath31 for that bin .",
    "the four components of @xmath30 are : @xmath32 and the sixteen components of @xmath31 are : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent colors , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 colors ( respectively ) of the @xmath42 non - reddened quasar in the @xmath28 redshift bin .",
    "we then refine @xmath30 and @xmath31 by utilizing the following iterative procedure : ( 1 ) assume that the color distribution of the non - reddened quasars in the @xmath28 bin is a four - dimensional multivariate normal distribution with mean @xmath30 and covariance @xmath31 , ( 2 ) throw out any quasars in that bin with colors that lie in the outermost one percent of this hypothetical distribution , and ( 3 ) recalculate @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the remaining quasars in the bin .",
    "repeat this procedure until @xmath30 and @xmath31 are unaltered ; for the edr data , we found that two iterations ( removing roughly 7% of the non - reddened quasars ) were sufficient .",
    "the final @xmath30 and @xmath31 , for all @xmath43 , define the empirical color - redshift relation , or czr . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , we plot a representation of the czr constructed from the non - reddened quasars in the edr quasar catalog . in the four plots ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 ( _ solid lines _ ) and @xmath46 ( _ dashed lines _ ) are plotted versus redshift .    another way to visualize",
    "the czr is as a track in color - space , made of a series of four - dimensional multivariate gaussian distributions ( one for each redshift bin ) .",
    "each gaussian has an ellipsoidal cross - section . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we plot the edr quasar czr in two - dimensional projections of color - space . the czr track for @xmath47 is completely contained in one small region of color - space @xmath48 magnitudes across .",
    "quasars at these redshifts have similar colors , since the optical / uv continuum of a quasar spectrum is well - approximated by a power - law ( which is invariant with redshift ) .",
    "this illustrates why it was so difficult to obtain photometric redshifts for these quasars using photographic plate photometry , with errors of @xmath49 magnitudes .",
    "now that we have constructed the czr , we are ready to determine photometric redshifts .      for a particular quasar in @xmath12",
    "for which we want to obtain a photometric redshift @xmath16 , let the vector @xmath50 be its observed colors @xmath51 , and let the matrix @xmath52 be the covariance matrix of its colors .",
    "the latter can be derived from the one - sigma uncertainties in its observed magnitudes @xmath15 , assuming that the errors are uncorrelated with each other : @xmath53    we now compute the chi - square value , @xmath54 , between the observed colors of the quasar , and the czr s @xmath28 redshift bin : @xmath55 and from this @xmath10 value , derive the probability @xmath56 that the quasar s redshift lies in the @xmath28 redshift bin : @xmath57 where @xmath56 is normalized so that its sum over all @xmath43 is unity .",
    "@xmath58 is the a priori probability that a quasar has a redshift in the @xmath28 redshift bin .",
    "if the redshift distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are expected to be similar , then @xmath58 is the fraction of quasars in @xmath11 ( both reddened and non - reddened ) that lie in the @xmath28 redshift bin ; otherwise @xmath58 should be equal to @xmath59 for all @xmath43 .",
    "if the object is identified as an extended source by the sdss photometric pipeline , it is probably at a redshift of less than one . in that case , we only calculate probabilities @xmath56 for the @xmath60 redshift bins that lie between @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( where this upper limit is an argument to the algorithm ) , and @xmath17 is replaced with @xmath60 in the formulae for @xmath63 and @xmath56 above .",
    "( for an extended object , @xmath58 is handled in exactly the same way as it is for a point - source . )",
    "of course there are dangers in taking this approach .",
    "for example , at fainter magnitudes the sdss s star - galaxy separation can break down , and superposition of sources can mimic extended objects .    finally , to obtain a photometric redshift for the quasar , we search for groups of consecutive redshift bins for which each @xmath56 exceeds some threshold value ( our choice was @xmath59 ) .",
    "each such group defines :    * a photometric redshift ( the redshift bin in the group with the largest @xmath56 ) , * an approximate range to the photometric redshift ( obtained from the lowest and highest redshifts in the group ) , and * a probability ( or `` confidence - level '' ) that the actual redshift is within this range ( the sum of @xmath56 for all redshift bins in the group ) .",
    "one can either restrict one s attention to the photometric redshift with the highest probability , or list multiple choices for the photometric redshift with their associated probabilities .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] is an illustration of how to derive photometric redshifts from @xmath56 .",
    "we display @xmath56 as a function of redshift for four edr quasars .",
    "the dashed line is the threshold probability level of @xmath59 .",
    "each spike in @xmath56 which reaches above this threshold represents one possibility for @xmath16 . for each quasar ,",
    "the most likely photometric redshifts are listed , along with their ranges and confidence - levels .",
    "the top two quasars in the figure have only one likely photometric redshift each , while for the bottom two , there are several possible @xmath16 .      between the publication of rw01 and now , we have made the following refinements to our original photo-@xmath2 algorithm :    * the empirical czr is parameterized in a more refined way .",
    "it is now parameterized as a series of four - dimensional multivariate gaussians with ellipsoidal cross - sections , one for each redshift bin .",
    "( modulo a @xmath64% tail of red quasars , ( 2003 ) found that the color distribution of sdss quasars is relatively gaussian . )",
    "the variances of the gaussians ( which define the `` width '' of the czr ) are allowed to change as a function of redshift .",
    "also , the covariances of the gaussians are taken into account , i.e. : the principal axes of the gaussians ellipsoidal cross - sections are not required to be aligned with the four axes of color - space . * the uncertainties in the observed colors of an individual quasar",
    "are handled more rigorously .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath21 color of a quasar is correlated with the uncertainty in its @xmath22 color ( since both involve the quasar s @xmath65-magnitude ) ; in other words , the covariance between the quasar s @xmath21 and @xmath22 colors is not zero . when finding the photometric redshift of a particular quasar , we therefore consider the full covariance matrix ( covariances as well as variances ) for its observed colors . as a corollary to these first two refinements ,",
    "the expression for the @xmath10 statistic is more complicated , as shown in section  [ sec : algstep3 ] . * the photometric redshift of a quasar",
    "is now determined by maximizing its probability @xmath56 , rather than minimizing its @xmath10 as a function of redshift .",
    "now that we allow the width of the czr to vary with redshift , it is no longer true that @xmath56 is solely related to @xmath54 ; it also depends on the covariance matrix of the czr . for this reason",
    ", we can no longer let @xmath10 minimization stand in for probability maximization , but rather we must let the latter determine the photometric redshift .",
    "* we can optionally take into account the fact that certain quasar redshifts are more likely than others , if that knowledge is available a priori .",
    "for instance , suppose we have a large set of quasars for which we wish to find photometric redshifts , and for some small subset of these quasars we have spectra and therefore know their spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "as long as this subset was chosen in an unbiased way , it is reasonable to assume that the redshift distribution of all the quasars is identical to the redshift distribution of the subset .",
    "thus , we can weight the photometric redshift probabilities @xmath56 by the redshift distribution of the subset , so that certain redshifts will be favored more than others . *",
    "if a quasar candidate is detected as an extended source by the sdss photometric pipeline ( lupton et  al .",
    "2001 ) , its redshift is probably @xmath66 . in the current photometric redshift technique ,",
    "we only consider redshifts less than 1 for the @xmath16 of an extended object .",
    "to compare the efficiency of the new photometric redshift algorithm with that of the one from rw01 , the algorithm was tested on the early data release quasar catalog ( schneider et  al .",
    "this catalog consists of 3814 quasars with both sdss photometry and spectra . unlike the set of 2625 quasars and seyferts that we used to test the earlier version of the algorithm in rw01 , all of the edr quasars have at least one emission line with fwhm @xmath67 km s@xmath68 , a luminosity of @xmath69 , and very reliable redshifts .",
    "( it should be noted , however , that neither data set is statistically homogeneous , since the quasar - selection algorithm was still undergoing changes and improvements while these data - sets were being made ; see 2002 . )",
    "although there exist newer data than the edr data , the number of objects with redshifts and the quality of their photometry are more than sufficient for our tests . furthermore , similar results are obtained for a much larger sample of dr1 objects analyzed by ( 2004 ) .      after constructing a czr from the 3814 edr quasars",
    ", the photo-@xmath2 algorithm was run on the same set of quasars ; these photometric redshifts were compared to the true , spectroscopic redshifts . since , for these tests , @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "are identical , we used @xmath58 to weight @xmath56 by the redshift distribution of the edr quasars .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig4 ] and  [ fig : fig5 ] show the results of this exercise . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , we plot the most probable photometric redshift @xmath16 of each quasar against its spectroscopic redshift @xmath13 .",
    "most of the photometric redshifts agree well with the spectroscopic redshifts , with incorrect photometric redshifts generally coming in the form of degeneracies between very different redshifts ( e.g. , between @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) or from `` smearing '' of nearby redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath72 ) . of the 3814 quasars , the number ( percent ) with photometric redshifts that were correct to within 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3",
    "were : 2348 ( 61.6% ) , 2963 ( 77.7% ) , and 3159 ( 82.8% ) , respectively .",
    "this result should be compared to the corresponding result in rw01 ( using the old version of the algorithm ) , where only 70.0% of the quasars photometric redshifts were correct to within 0.2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , we plot a histogram of @xmath73 for these same quasars .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : algstep3 ] , our photometric redshift algorithm supplies not only a value for each quasar s @xmath16 , but a range around that @xmath16 , and an associated confidence - level ( the probability that the spectroscopic redshift is within the range ) .",
    "for example , the photometric redshift of a quasar might be given as @xmath74 , to 85% confidence .",
    "of the 3814 edr quasars , the spectroscopic redshift lies within the range for 3176 of them ( 83.3% ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig6 ] shows the distribution of range sizes .",
    "the median range size is 0.42 , and 90% of the ranges are smaller than 0.64 .",
    "thus most of our @xmath16 error bars are @xmath75 or smaller .",
    "we test the confidence level supplied with the photometric redshifts in the following manner .",
    "consider all of the quasars whose photometric redshift ranges have associated confidence levels of ( say ) 50 - 55% .",
    "one would expect that roughly 50 - 55% of these quasars would have their spectroscopic redshifts within the given range , if the confidence level was reliable .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig7 ] shows that the confidence levels pass this test very well , especially when there are many quasars with the same confidence level : roughly @xmath76% of the objects with @xmath76% confidence level have a spectroscopic redshift within the range .      in any practical application of the photometric redshift algorithm",
    ", @xmath11 and @xmath12 will not be identical sets .",
    "we therefore performed two more tests using the edr quasars , to measure the efficiency of the method in this more realistic case .    in the first test",
    ", we randomly chose 954 ( 25% ) of the edr quasars from which to construct the czr .",
    "this czr was used to predict photometric redshifts for the remaining 2860 edr objects .",
    "since in this case @xmath11 and @xmath12 are both drawn from the edr quasars , the redshift distributions of the two sets will be the same .",
    "so for this test , we weighted the photometric redshifts of the quasars in @xmath12 by the redshift distribution of the quasars in @xmath11 .",
    "of the 2860 quasars , the number ( percent ) of them with photometric redshifts correct to within 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 are : 1598 ( 55.9% ) , 2136 ( 74.7% ) , and 2312 ( 80.8% ) , respectively .",
    "the efficiency of the method is nearly as high as when the quasars in the czr and the quasars being tested were identical .    in the second test",
    ", we made the czr from the 2829 edr quasars with @xmath77 , and used it and our @xmath16 technique to obtain photometric redshifts for the 985 @xmath78 objects .",
    "for this test , the redshift distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not necessarily the same .",
    "therefore , we did not weight the photometric redshifts by the redshift distribution of the czr . of the 985 edr quasars with @xmath78 ,",
    "the number ( percent ) of them with photometric redshifts correct to within 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 are : 499 ( 50.7% ) , 681 ( 69.1% ) , and 733 ( 74.4% ) , respectively .",
    "these efficiencies are somewhat lower than those of the previous tests , because all of the objects in @xmath12 are faint , and thus have larger photometric uncertainties . nevertheless , the results are still quite good compared with previous work in this field .",
    "another test worth mentioning is one where instead of comparing the colors of input objects to a single czr , we compared colors to multiple czrs defined as a function of their broad spectral slope .",
    "specifically , we created multiple czrs for quasars as a function of their @xmath24 colors .",
    "we can then determine photometric redshifts with respect to each of these czrs .",
    "this approach is motivated by the finding of ( 2003 ) that quasars with different optical colors have somewhat different emission line properties .",
    "unfortunately , we found that using multiple czrs did not help and we will hereafter only consider photometric redshifts derived from comparisons to the single median czr .        in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ,",
    "the 122 black squares are quasars that were classified as `` extended '' ( i.e. , not a point source ) by the sdss photometric pipeline ( lupton et  al .",
    "2001 ) based on a comparison of psf and model magnitudes .",
    "most of these objects have @xmath79 as expected , justifying our weighting of extended sources to low redshift .",
    "extended objects with spectroscopic redshifts larger than 1 are most likely either lensed quasars , star - quasar superpositions , or galaxy - quasar superpositions .",
    "any of these , if unresolved , could be mistaken for a single extended source .",
    "our use of psf magnitudes will partially mitigate the effects of the host galaxy , but the psf quasar photometry is still influenced by host galaxy light for extended sources .",
    "host galaxy light will alter the observed colors of the quasars , which would cause a problem with obtaining accurate photometric redshifts .",
    "indeed , when the earlier version of our @xmath16 algorithm ( presented in rw01 ) was applied to the edr quasars , 46 out of the 122 extended quasars ( 37.7% ) had @xmath80 ; most of these were assigned photometric redshifts greater than one .    by restricting the redshift range of extended sources",
    ", there are now only 19 extended quasars with incorrect photometric redshifts .",
    "since 16 have @xmath81 , we are really missing only three quasars .",
    "( of course , the 27 extended quasars recovered in this way are negligible compared to the 3814 quasars in the entire sample , so our overall efficiency only increased by a fraction of a percent . )",
    "thus , it appears that we do not have to worry about getting incorrect photometric redshifts for extended quasars .",
    "of the 3814 quasars in the edr , 313 are reddened according to our definition ; these are plotted with black pluses in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "since these quasars have unusual colors for their redshifts , it is clear that their photometric redshifts will probably be incorrect .",
    "an examination of figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows that this is indeed the situation ; of the 313 reddened quasars , 192 of them ( 61.3% ) have photometric redshifts with @xmath80 .",
    "since the majority of reddened quasars will have incorrect @xmath16 , we could increase the efficiency of our photometric redshift algorithm if they could be identified from photometric information alone , and excluded from the sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig8 ] shows the positions in color - space of the reddened quasars ( black points ) and the non - reddened quasars ( gray points ) . for the most part , the non - reddened quasars are found in a four - dimensional ellipsoidal gaussian , and the reddened quasars are in a second ellipsoidal gaussian , substantially offset from the non - reddened one . ( the quasars not found in the gaussians are @xmath82 quasars , which have the lyman @xmath5 forest redshifted into the sdss filters . )    here we have a similar problem to that of finding photometric redshifts . in both cases , quasars of different kinds",
    "are found in roughly ellipsoidal gaussians , separated from each other in color - space .",
    "if we quantify the positions , sizes , and shapes of the different gaussians , we can calculate the probability that any particular object ( a point in color - space ) was drawn from one of the gaussian distributions .",
    "hence , we can use the photometric redshift technique itself ( slightly modified ) to obtain an approximate probability that a given quasar is reddened .",
    "we used the czr branch of the @xmath16 algorithm ( see section  [ sec : algstep2 ] ) to measure the ellipsoidal gaussians for the reddened and non - reddened quasars . to remove the @xmath83 quasars , we ran ten iterations of the outlier - removing procedure ( see   [ sec : algstep2 ] ) , instead of two .",
    "projections of the derived gaussians are plotted in figure  [ fig : fig8 ] with a dashed line ( for the non - reddened quasars ) and a solid line ( for the reddened quasars ) .",
    "we then used the last part of the @xmath16 algorithm ( see section  [ sec : algstep3 ] ) to calculate the probability , @xmath84 , that an edr quasar belongs to the non - reddened distribution , and the probability , @xmath85 , that it belongs to the reddened distribution ( where @xmath86 ) .",
    "this was done for all 3814 edr quasars .",
    "since there are 11.2 times more non - reddened quasars than there are reddened quasars , we weighted @xmath84 and @xmath85 accordingly .",
    "we then can use @xmath85 to select out mostly non - reddened quasars . if we consider only the edr quasars with @xmath87 , we will have 3384 quasars , and only 106 of them ( or 3.1% ) will be reddened ( a reduction in total sample size of 13% but a drop in the `` contaminated fraction '' from 8.2% to 3.1% ) .",
    "subsets with a higher fraction of non - reddened quasars can be made by lowering the upper bound on @xmath85 , although at the cost of making the subsets somewhat smaller ; for example , there are only 2617 quasars with @xmath88 , but only one of them is reddened .",
    "although we have not made such @xmath85 cuts in this paper , we see that @xmath85 can be used to largely eliminate reddened quasars using only photometric information .",
    "in future work , we will use @xmath85 to improve the efficiency of our photometric technique still further .      of the 655 edr quasars with @xmath89",
    ", 192 are reddened , and 19 are extended . that still leaves 444 `` ordinary '' quasars with incorrect @xmath16",
    " and many of these are _ really _ incorrect , with @xmath90 or even @xmath91 !",
    "an examination of figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows that these quasars are placed roughly symmetrically about the @xmath92 diagonal .",
    "for instance , some quasars with @xmath93 are assigned a @xmath16 of 2.1 , whereas some quasars with @xmath94 are given a @xmath16 of 0.8 .",
    "this situation arises because there is considerable degeneracy in the color - redshift relation for @xmath95  i.e. : quasars at fairly different redshifts ( like 0.8 and 2.1 ) can still have very similar colors .",
    "color - redshift degeneracies occur when the czr intersects itself ( or does so very nearly ) in color - space  see the inset of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] for an illustration of this .    when a quasar s colors are consistent with two ( or more ) redshifts , the function @xmath56 ( the probability that its redshift is in redshift bin @xmath43 ) has two or more peaks of roughly equal size , at each of the possible redshifts .",
    "an example is the bottom - right plot in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , which shows a degeneracy between @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( easily seen in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "if the algorithm is looking for the most probable @xmath16 , it may or may not pick the correct one . fortunately , our algorithm can be directed to search out the @xmath98 most likely photometric redshifts , where @xmath98 is any desired integer .",
    "thus , if we find that two or more choices for @xmath16 have similar confidence - levels , we at least know that one of them is probably correct ( although we do not know which one ! ) .",
    "if @xmath56 is being weighted by the redshift distribution of the czr , that may help the algorithm select the correct @xmath16 . for instance , in the edr , there are twice as many quasars with @xmath99 as there are with @xmath100 .",
    "so even though quasars at either redshift have very similar colors , a quasar with these colors is twice as likely to have a redshift of 1.5 , and the weighting of @xmath56 will reflect this . of course",
    ", this will only work if the redshift distribution of @xmath12 is similar to that of @xmath11 .",
    "it should also be noted that this weighting technique will be of most use if one is searching for the @xmath98 most likely photometric redshifts , and listing them by probability ( as is done in fig .  [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "if one is only searching for the most likely photometric redshift , then the weighting will cause the algorithm to always select the more common redshift when faced with a true degeneracy ( e.g. , @xmath96 over @xmath97 ) .",
    "since degenerate redshifts are found where the czr intersects itself in color - space , we can create a map of the degenerate redshifts by measuring the `` distance '' in color - space between any two points on the czr  the closer they are , the more degenerate the corresponding redshifts . figure  [ fig : fig9 ] is such a map .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] , the color of the pixel at position @xmath101 represents the @xmath10 `` distance '' between redshift @xmath76 and redshift @xmath102 in the czr .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath10 , the more similar the colors of quasars at these redshifts .",
    "notice that the structure of figures  [ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig9 ] are similar ( modulo the fact that figure  [ fig : fig9 ] is symmetric by definition , whereas figure  [ fig : fig4 ] need not be ) .",
    "thus , consulting this map is a way to determine whether or not a quasar with a certain @xmath16 has degenerate colors .",
    "in this section , we present a second round of tests , in which we apply our @xmath16 algorithm to quasar candidates selected by the final version of the sdss quasar - selection algorithm .",
    "we call this data - set the final early data release ( fedr ) , since its objects are found in the same region of sky as the edr .",
    "many of these objects have no spectra , and a significant fraction of those that do are not quasars .",
    "we also introduce the concepts of the `` window '' ( a @xmath16 cut ) and the `` box '' ( a series of color cuts ) through which  by solely photometric means  we can select quasar candidates that are mostly quasars , the majority of which have accurate photometric redshifts .",
    "although the edr quasar tests presented in   [ chap : edrqtests ] are encouraging , and show that the photometric redshift algorithm is working well , they are not realistic exercises in that we already know that all 3814 objects are quasars . in a real application , the objects chosen to be quasar candidates ( based on their photometry only ) will include many non - quasars .",
    "the tests described in this section are designed to see what happens when our @xmath16 algorithm operates on more realistic data . for these tests ,",
    "our czr was , as before , constructed from the edr quasar catalog .",
    "however , we then used this czr to find photometric redshifts for the fedr , a set of 8740 objects which we describe below .",
    "( since in this case @xmath11 and @xmath12 probably do not have the same redshift distributions , we did not weight the photometric redshifts . )",
    "the fedr is a set of quasar candidates from the same region of sky as the edr quasars .",
    "the quasar - selection algorithm used to select these objects was the final , current version ( discussed in 2002 ) ; as such these objects are statistically homogeneous , in contrast to the edr quasars from ( 2002 ) .",
    "since the fedr objects were selected solely by photometric means , not all have spectra .",
    "of the 8740 objects , 3985 are of unknown type .",
    "( most of these have no spectra ; 22 have unidentifiable spectra . )",
    "the other 4755 were identified by the sdss selection algorithm as : 52 `` late - type '' stars ( type m , l , or t ) , 527 `` regular '' stars , 828 normal galaxies , and 3348 quasars and agns .    in presenting the results of the fedr tests ,",
    "we first consider how well the photometric redshift algorithm performed for 1 ) the 3348 fedr objects known to be quasars , 2 ) the 1407 fedr objects known to be non - quasars , and 3 ) the 3985 fedr objects of unknown type .      of the 3348 objects spectroscopically confirmed to be quasars ,",
    "the number ( percent ) with photometric redshifts that were correct to within 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 were : 2156 ( 64.4% ) , 2692 ( 80.4% ) , and 2860 ( 85.4% ) , respectively .",
    "there were 2783 quasars ( 83.1% ) whose spectroscopic redshifts lay within the photometric redshift ranges .",
    "the distribution of range sizes has a median of 0.39 , and 90% of the ranges are smaller than 0.64 .",
    "the confidence levels quoted for the photometric redshifts error bars appear to be reasonable .",
    "these results are quite similar to those found for the edr quasars , not surprisingly given the degree of overlap in the two sets .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig10 ] is a histogram of the photometric redshifts for all 8740 objects .",
    "grey bars show the @xmath16 distribution for all of the objects , including those that have no spectra , while black bars show the @xmath16 distribution for only the 4755 objects with spectra .",
    "the red , green , yellow , and blue histograms show the @xmath16 distributions for confirmed quasars , stars , late - type stars , and galaxies , respectively .",
    "the brown , dashed histogram shows the @xmath13 distribution of the 3348 confirmed quasars , for comparison .",
    "most of the photometric redshifts assigned to confirmed non - quasars take on a few specific values .",
    "nearly all galaxies are assigned photometric redshifts between 0.3 and 0.7 .",
    "many stars receive a photometric redshift between 2.8 and 2.9 ; most others are found between 0.6 and 0.7 , or between 4.2 and 4.3 .",
    "almost all late - type stars have a photometric redshift between 4.2 and 4.4 .",
    "the color - space distributions of stars and galaxies intersect ( or at least approach ) the quasar czr at these specific redshift values . also , there are almost no non - quasars assigned photometric redshifts between 0.8 and 2.2 .",
    "these results are very encouraging .",
    "suppose one uses the sdss quasar - selection algorithm to find quasar candidates .",
    "the majority of those that receive photometric redshifts between 2.8 and 2.9 are actually stars ( as expected given that the quasar color track crosses the stellar locus near these redshifts and that the density of stars far exceeds the density of quasars ) .",
    "most other non - quasar contaminants will have photometric redshifts in the ranges 0.30.7 , or 4.24.4 .",
    "any objects with these photometric redshifts should be flagged as suspected non - quasars , while the others ( especially those with @xmath103 ) are likely to be quasars .",
    "we can perhaps do even better by investigating whether non - quasars and quasars with similar @xmath16 can be separated by their colors .",
    "the two plots in figure  [ fig : fig11 ] , which are two - dimensional projections of color - space , show the locations of various objects .",
    "grey squares are of unknown type .",
    "red , green , and blue circles are confirmed quasars , stars , and galaxies , respectively .",
    "the objects in the two plots of figure  [ fig : fig11 ] have photometric redshifts in the ranges 0.5 - 0.6 ( _ left _ ) , and 2.8 - 2.9 ( _ right _ ) .",
    "we see that most quasars and galaxies with photometric redshifts of 0.5 - 0.6 can be separated by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , while most quasars and stars with photometric redshifts of 2.8 - 2.9 can be differentiated by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this allows us to retrieve most quasars with these photometric redshifts .",
    "referring again to figure  [ fig : fig10 ] , compare the @xmath16 distributions for all objects ( _ grey bars _ ) and objects with identifiable spectra ( _ black bars _ ) . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the two distributions are roughly the same ( except for overall normalization ) .",
    "however , for @xmath105 , and especially for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , there are many more objects without spectra than we might expect .",
    "this is because of the way the final quasar - selection algorithm was designed .",
    "previous versions of the selection algorithm missed many quasars with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , because these lie in the same region of color - space as late - type stars .",
    "the final version was therefore designed to probe deeper into this region ( richards et  al .",
    "2002 ) . generally speaking ,",
    "since the previous versions of the selection algorithm were used to make the edr quasar catalog ( for which spectra were taken ) , most of the objects in the fedr that do not have spectra were only selected with the final selection algorithm .",
    "thus , we find a striking abundance of objects with no spectra having @xmath105 .",
    "most of these are probably late - type stars that are included as contaminants in the sdss s attempt to be as complete as possible to bright @xmath110 quasars ; many of these candidates are from a small number of data frames that have sub - standard photometry  causing stars within the stellar locus to scatter into the quasar distribution .",
    "we now turn our attention to the objects whose photometric redshifts lie in the largely uncontaminated window between 0.8 and 2.2 .",
    "these will be called window objects",
    ".    there are 2459 objects in the window ; 1902 of them are confirmed quasars , while only 22 and 27 are confirmed stars and galaxies , respectively .",
    "the remaining 508 objects are of unknown type . if we assume that the distribution of unknown objects is the same as that of the known ones , then approximately 97.5% of the window objects are quasars .",
    "if an object selected as a quasar - candidate by the selection algorithm has a @xmath16 in the window , it is almost certainly a quasar .",
    "the efficiency of the @xmath16 algorithm is also better in the window . out of",
    "the 1902 confirmed quasars in the window , the number ( percent ) with photometric redshifts correct to within 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 are : 1314 ( 69.1% ) , 1638 ( 86.1% ) , and 1746 ( 91.8% ) .",
    "thus , 89.5% of the objects in the window ( that is , 91.8% of 97.5% ) are quasars with photometric redshifts correct to within 0.3 .",
    "it is also of interest to determine regions of color space that yield higher than average quasar efficiencies ( quasars : quasar candidates ) .",
    "( 2004 ) describe the application of a complex algorithm to the sdss - dr1 dataset ; however , for many applications users may prefer a simpler method . as such , we define a region of color space that was designed to yield mostly window objects such that one can dispense with the quasar - selection algorithm altogether and simply query the sdss database for objects with colors in this region of color - space .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig12 ] shows a region of color - space which we call `` the box , '' designed to include primarily window objects .",
    "the box is defined by the intersection of the following cuts in color - space : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is equal to @xmath76 if @xmath113 and @xmath102 if @xmath114 .",
    "of the 8740 objects in our sample , 1752 of them lie in the box .",
    "1578 of these are objects with @xmath103 : 1256 confirmed quasars , 11 confirmed non - quasars , and 311 unknown objects . if we assume that the unknown objects contain the same fraction of quasars as the known ones , then 89.3% of the objects in the box are quasars with @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the color - cuts we have chosen do succeed in selecting mostly window quasars .    of the 1256 window quasars found in the box ,",
    "most have accurate photometric redshifts ( as expected ) .",
    "there are 874 with @xmath16 accurate to within 0.1 , 1086 to within 0.2 , and 1159 to within 0.3 .",
    "so if we apply the box color - cuts to sdss data , roughly 83% of them will be quasars with @xmath16 accurate to within 0.3 .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that although the box is very efficient at picking out mostly window quasars and little else , it by no means selects all of the window quasars . within our sample ,",
    "there are 1902 confirmed quasars with @xmath103 , whereas the box contains only 1256 , or 66% .",
    "we have presented an updated version of the empirical quasar photo-@xmath2 algorithm originally presented by rw01 . this improved version of the code yields redshifts for known quasars that are accurate to @xmath115 in redshift for 83% of quasars in the edr quasar catalog .",
    "in addition , the algorithm returns accurate probabilities that these redshifts are within a given range  making it possible to better identify those 17% of quasars that have erroneous photo-@xmath2 s .",
    "we have further shown that it is possible to use the algorithm to identify non - quasars among quasar candidates and therefore to construct the most robust samples ( in terms of quasar identification and photo-@xmath2 accuracy ) among samples of unknown objects .",
    "( 2004 ) discuss the application of this photo-@xmath2 algorithm to a sample of over 100,000 sdss - dr1 quasar candidates .",
    "the efficiency of their selection algorithm combined with the accuracy of our photo-@xmath2 algorithm suggest that over 80,000 of these objects will be quasars with accurate photometric redshifts , demonstrating that it will be possible to construct a sample of hundreds of thousands of quasars by the end of the sdss project .",
