    "in a high energy collision between two hadrons or a photon and a hadron it takes a finite amount of time for the reaction products to evolve to physical particles . during the collision process some momentum transfer between the hadrons or some hard scattering between two of the hadrons constituents leads to the excitation of hadronic strings .",
    "the time that is needed for the creation and fission of these strings as well as for the hadronization of the string fragments can not be calculated within perturbative qcd because the hadronization process involves small momentum transfers of typically only a few hundred mev .",
    "one can perform an estimate of the formation time @xmath3 in the rest frame of the hadron .",
    "it should be of the order of the time that the quark - antiquark ( quark - diquark ) pair needs to reach a separation , that is of the size of the produced hadron ( @xmath4  fm ) : @xmath5    during their evolution to physical hadrons the reaction products will react with reduced cross sections .",
    "this is motivated by means of color transparency : the strings and the substrings created during the fragmentation are in a color singlet state and therefore react with a cross section that increases with their transverse size . as a consequence the produced hadrons travel inside the nuclear medium with a reduced scattering probability during their formation time .",
    "hence the formation time plays an important role in the dynamics of nuclear reactions , e.g. heavy ion collisions , proton and pion induced reactions as well as photon and electron induced reactions on nuclei .",
    "+ the latter two are of special interest because they are less complex than heavy ion collisions and , in contrast to hadron induced reactions , the primary reaction does in general not only take place at the surface of the nucleus but also at larger densities .",
    "experiments at tjnaf and desy , for example , deal with exclusive and semi - inclusive meson photo- and electroproduction at high energies .",
    "large photon energies @xmath6 are of special interest because of time dilatation the formation length @xmath7 in the rest frame of the nucleus can exceed nuclear dimensions : @xmath8 if one chooses the formation time to be @xmath9  fm / c , the formation length in the rest frame of the nucleus will be about 30  fm for a 5  gev pion and about 7  fm for a 5  gev kaon or a 7  gev @xmath10 meson .",
    "these lengths have to be compared with the typical size of nuclear radii , e.g. 2.7  fm for @xmath11c and 7.1  fm for @xmath12pb . because it suppresses the final state interactions , the formation time has a big effect on photonuclear production cross sections at high energies .",
    "turning this argument around , exclusive and semi - inclusive photoproduction of mesons on nuclei  @xcite offer a possibility to study these formation times if the fsi are well under control .",
    "+ usually , the fsi are modeled within glauber theory  @xcite and treated purely absorptive . a more realistic description of the fsi has to take also regeneration of the mesons studied into account .",
    "for this we use a coupled channel semi - classical transport model based on the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) equation .",
    "originally developed to describe heavy ion collisions  @xcite at sis energies it has been extended in later works to investigate also inclusive particle production in heavy ion collisions up to 200  agev and @xmath13  @xcite and @xmath14 induced as well as photon and electron induced reactions in the resonance region  @xcite .",
    "inclusive photoproduction of mesons at energies between 1 and 7  gev has been investigated in  @xcite",
    ". an attractive feature of this model is its capability to describe a large variety of very different reaction types in a consistent way .",
    "+ since photon induced reactions are known to be shadowed ( @xmath15 ) above photon energies of approximately 1  gev  @xcite , one needs a way to account for this shadowing effect in photoproduction .",
    "this is straightforward within glauber theory , but it is not clear how to account for this initial state coherence length effect in a semi - classical transport model for the fsi . a first attempt at combining the quantum mechanical coherence in the entrance channel with our incoherent treatment of the fsi has been made in  @xcite . in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] we present a new , improved way to implement shadowing in our model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] the results for exclusive @xmath1 photoproduction on @xmath12pb at 7  gev are compared with the predictions from simple glauber theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we also demonstrate the importance of the coupled channel treatment of the fsi by looking at the nuclear @xmath2 photoproduction cross section .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section we describe how we account for shadowing in our model and only sketch the principles of the transport model itself . for a detailed description of the transport model",
    "used we refer to  @xcite . in our model",
    "the incoherent reaction of a high energy photon with a nucleus takes place in two steps . in the first step the photon reacts with one nucleon inside the nucleus ( impulse approximation ) and produces some final state @xmath16 . in this process nuclear effects like fermi motion , binding energies and pauli blocking of the final state nucleons are taken into account . in the second step the final state @xmath16 is propagated within the transport model .",
    "except for the elastic vector meson and exclusive strangeness production ( see  @xcite ) we use the lund string model fritiof  @xcite to describe high energy photoproduction on the nucleon .",
    "the same string model is also used to deal with high energy particle collisions in the fsi .",
    "since fritiof does not accept photons as incoming particles , @xmath10 dominance was used in  @xcite and the photon was passed as a massless @xmath1 .",
    "this led to an excellent description of charged particle multiplicities in @xmath17 collisions .",
    "+ here we generalize to vector meson dominance ( vmd )  @xcite by writing the incoming photon state as @xmath18 and pass the photon as a massless @xmath1 , @xmath19 or @xmath20 with a probability corresponding to the strength of the vector meson coupling to the photon times its nucleonic cross section @xmath21 @xmath22 these probabilities follow from using ( [ eq : vmd ] ) in the optical theorem : @xmath23 as can be seen from ( [ eq : vmd ] ) and ( [ eq : opti ] ) there is also a finite probability @xmath24 that the bare photon @xmath25 has to be passed to fritiof ; the component @xmath25 does not get shadowed in the nucleus . in a generalized vmd model for example",
    "the @xmath25 includes contributions from heavy intermediate hadronic states which , as we show later , are not shadowed because of the large momentum transfer @xmath26 that is needed to put them on their mass shell . since fritiof",
    "does not accept a bare photon as input we replace it again by a vector meson @xmath27(=@xmath1 , @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) , with the probability @xmath28    the particle production in fritiof can be decomposed into two parts .",
    "first there is a momentum transfer taking place between the two incoming hadrons leaving two excited strings with the quantum numbers of the initial hadrons .",
    "after that the two strings fragment into the observed particles . as a formation time we use 0.8  fm / c in the rest frame of each hadron",
    "; during this time the hadrons do not interact with the rest of the system .",
    "+ up to now we did not take shadowing into account . in glauber theory",
    "this corresponds to using only the left amplitude in fig .",
    "[ fig : glauber ] , where a photon directly produces some hadron @xmath16 at nucleon @xmath29 .",
    "the left amplitude alone leads to the unshadowed incoherent photoproduction cross section @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the nucleon number density , @xmath32 the number density of nucleons with the correct charge to produce the hadron @xmath16 and @xmath33 is the total @xmath34 cross section .",
    "the exponential damping factor in ( [ eq : unshad ] ) describes the absorption of the particle @xmath16 on its way out of the nucleus .",
    "+ in glauber theory shadowing arises from the interference of the left amplitude in fig .",
    "[ fig : glauber ] with the second amplitude of order @xmath35 which is shown on the right hand side . in this process",
    "the photon produces a vector meson @xmath27 on nucleon @xmath36 without excitation of the nucleus .",
    "this vector meson then scatters at fixed impact parameter @xmath37 ( eikonal approximation ) through the nucleus to nucleon @xmath29 and produces the final state meson @xmath16 , leaving the nucleus in the same excited state as in the direct process .",
    "off - diagonal scattering , where a vector meson @xmath27 scatters into a different vector meson @xmath38 , is usually neglected . in view of the upcoming discussion of exclusive @xmath1 photoproduction on",

    "a large momentum transfer @xmath26 is suppressed by the elastic nuclear formfactor and leads to less shadowing due to the oscillating factor @xmath43 $ ] in the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : glauber ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath26 is just the inverse of the coherence length , i.e. the distance , given by the uncertainty principle , which the photon can travel as a @xmath27 fluctuation .",
    "for the quantities in ( [ eq : glauber ] ) we use the parameterizations of model  i of ref .",
    "@xcite with which one obtains a very good description of the shadowing effect in nuclear photoabsorption down to the onset region  @xcite .",
    "+ one clearly sees from ( [ eq : glauber ] ) how the fsi separate from the initial state interactions of the photon .",
    "we now replace the exponential damping factor @xmath44 $ ] , which corresponds to purely absorptive fsi , by a transport model .",
    "this allows us to incorporate a wider class of fsi .",
    "in addition we want to include events where the final vector meson @xmath27 is not produced in the primary reaction but via sidefeeding .",
    "this leads to less reduction of the nuclear production cross section even with the same @xmath21 .",
    "we thus also need to know how all the other possible primary reactions are shadowed .",
    "we , therefore , start from ( [ eq : vmd ] ) and use glauber theory to calculate how the single @xmath27 components of the photon change due to multiple scattering on the way to nucleon @xmath29 where the state @xmath16 is produced  @xcite : @xmath45 here the ( photon energy dependent ) nuclear profile functions for the different vector meson components @xmath27 are given as @xmath46.\\ ] ] note that the @xmath25 component is , by definition , not modified due to the presence of the nuclear medium .",
    "the cross section for the photon to react with nucleon @xmath29 at position @xmath47 inside the nucleus can be deduced via ( [ eq : gamma ] ) from the optical theorem : @xmath48 like for the photon in vacuum each term gives the relative weight for the corresponding photon component to be passed to fritiof . when integrated over the whole nucleus one gets from eq .",
    "( [ eq : inccs ] ) the total incoherent photonuclear cross section @xmath49 which is shown in fig .",

    "more than 90% of the difference between those two cross sections stems from coherent @xmath1 photoproduction .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig : aeff ] we show how strongly the @xmath1 and the @xmath20 components of a real 20  gev photon are separately shadowed in pb .",
    "we plot the number density of the nucleons reacting with the @xmath27 components of the photon @xmath53 as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "one clearly sees that due to its smaller nucleonic cross section the @xmath20 component is less shadowed than the @xmath1 component at the backside of the nucleus . as a consequence strangeness production ( e.g. @xmath54 photoproduction ) , where the primary reaction is preferably triggered by the @xmath20 component of the photon ,",
    "is less shadowed than , e. g. , @xmath13 photoproduction .",
    "this dependence of the strength of shadowing on the reaction type is new compared to the treatment of shadowing in  @xcite and can also be seen directly from the second amplitude in fig .",
    "[ fig : glauber ] because of the occurrence of the scattering process @xmath55 at nucleon @xmath29 . + as already mentioned above the purely absorptive fsi of the glauber model are very different from the coupled channel description of a transport model . the transport model we use",
    "is based on the buu equation that describes the time evolution of the phase space density @xmath56 of particles of type @xmath36 that can interact via binary reactions  @xcite . in our case",
    "these particles are the nucleons of the target nucleus as well as the baryonic resonances and mesons ( @xmath13 , @xmath57 , @xmath10 , @xmath54 , ... ) that can either be produced in the primary @xmath58 reaction or during the fsi . for particles of type @xmath36",
    "the buu equation looks as follows : @xmath59.\\ ] ] in the case of baryons the hamilton function @xmath60 includes a mean field potential which in our model depends on the particle position and momentum . the collision integral on the right hand side accounts for the creation and annihilation of particles of type @xmath36 in a collision as well as elastic scattering from one position in phase space into another . for fermions pauli blocking",
    "is taken into account in @xmath61 via blocking factors .",
    "for each particle type @xmath36 such a buu equation exists ; all are coupled via the mean field and the collision integral .",
    "this leads to a system of coupled differential - integral equations which we solve via a test particle ansatz for the phase space density ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "since the collision integral also accounts for particle creation in a collision the observed outgoing particle @xmath16 can not only be produced in the primary reaction , but can also be created by sidefeeding in which a particle @xmath62 is created first which propagates and then , by fsi , produces @xmath16 . in addition the state @xmath16",
    "might get absorbed on its way out of the nucleus but be fed in again in a later interaction .",
    "both cases can a priori not be ignored , but are usually neglected in glauber models .",
    "exclusive vector meson photo- and electroproduction on nuclei is an ideal tool to study effects of the coherence length , formation time and color transparency .",
    "exclusive @xmath1 electroproduction has been investigated in the hermes experiment  @xcite at photon energies between 10  gev and 20  gev and virtuality @xmath63  5  gev@xmath64 .",
    "the calculations for meson production on nuclei are usually done within glauber theory  @xcite . as already mentioned above the fsi in glauber theory",
    "are usually purely absorptive .",
    "this means that for the reaction @xmath65 the primary reaction has to be @xmath66 . if one treats the fsi via an absorptive optical potential one gets an exponential damping @xmath67 $ ] of the nuclear production cross section .",
    "+ we are presently working at incorporating also incoming virtual photons into the formalism developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] and at enlarging the configuration space for the fsi .",
    "here we discuss , therefore , only results obtained with real photons and at a lower energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclrho ] we show the results of our model for the mass differential cross section of incoherent , exclusive @xmath1 photoproduction on @xmath12pb for @xmath68  gev . in this case",
    "exclusive means that the final state consists of a @xmath69 pair and 208 bound nucleons .",
    "the solid line represents a calculation with the primary reaction restricted to @xmath70 .",
    "it already includes the effects of shadowing , fermi motion , pauli blocking and the nucleon potential , but no fsi .",
    "the dotted line shows the effect of the fsi without a formation time of the @xmath1 in @xmath70 .",
    "the glauber model yields quantitatively the same effect of the fsi .",
    "this means that in this case ( only @xmath70 as primary reaction ) fsi processes like @xmath71 , @xmath72 , where the primary @xmath1 gets absorbed first and is fed into the outgoing channel by a later fsi , are negligible . if one assumes a formation time of @xmath9  fm / c for the @xmath1 , one gets the result indicated by the dash - dotted line . due to the finite formation time",
    "there is considerably less absorption and the nuclear production cross section increases . if the observed spectrum looked like this , one would in glauber theory be lead to the conclusion of a finite @xmath1 formation time .",
    "+ however , one will get a similar result with @xmath73 if one allows for other primary reaction besides @xmath70 and uses a coupled channel model .",
    "this can be seen by looking at the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclrho ] .",
    "we find that about 60% of the additional @xmath1 stem from inelastic @xmath1 production in the primary reaction , e.g. @xmath74 where the @xmath13 gets absorbed during the fsi .",
    "we now apply an exclusivity measure like the one used in the hermes experiment  @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the nucleon mass and @xmath77 is the 4-momentum of the undetected final state . here",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 denote the 4-momenta of the incoming photon and the detected @xmath69 pair and @xmath80 is the 4-momentum of the struck nucleon which , for the calculation of @xmath81 , is assumed to be at rest . using ( [ eq : exclms ] )",
    "leads to a decrease of the cross section ( dash - dot - dotted line ) because some of the inelastic primary events are excluded .",
    "if the exclusivity measure was good enough to single out only the elastic @xmath70 reactions from the primary events , the dash - dot - dotted curve would coincide with the dotted line and glauber theory would be applicable . since this is not the case ,",
    "one still extracts a too large formation time when using glauber theory .",
    "+ one therefore needs a further constraint in addition to the exclusivity measure ( [ eq : exclms ] ) which becomes apparent by looking at the differential cross section @xmath82 in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclrho2 ] ; the meaning of the lines is as before . for @xmath83  gev@xmath64 the full calculation with exclusivity measure ( dash - dot - dotted line ) gives the same result as the one with the primary reaction @xmath70 and fsi ( dotted line )",
    ". in this kinematic regime glauber theory can therefore be used . for @xmath84  gev@xmath64 , however , the exclusivity measure ( [ eq : exclms ] ) can not distinguish between elastic @xmath1 photoproduction ( @xmath70 ) and other primary reactions , e.g. inelastic @xmath1 photoproduction ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) . at low values of @xmath87 there",
    "exist many states @xmath16 with invariant masses which are not excluded by the exclusivity measure ( [ eq : exclms ] ) .",
    "in addition we find that about 25% of the finally accepted @xmath1 in this @xmath88 region are not produced in the primary reaction but stem from sidefeeding in the fsi . in the hermes experiment",
    "one makes a lower @xmath87 cut to get rid of the coherent @xmath1 photoproduction contribution . in the case of lead and @xmath68",
    "gev the coherent part can be neglected above @xmath89  gev@xmath64 . for glauber theory to be reliable",
    "one has to increase this threshold to approximately @xmath90  gev@xmath64 .",
    "glauber theory can thus be trusted only under certain kinematic constraints . + so far we have discussed a case in which a strongly interacting particle , the @xmath1 meson , is produced . in the following",
    "we will now discuss the special effects that appear in a coupled channel treatment of the fsi when a weakly interacting particle , such as the @xmath2 meson , is considered . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaons ] we therefore show the cross section for the reaction @xmath91 in the photon energy range 1 - 7  gev for @xmath12pb .",

    "+ the importance of a coupled channel treatment of the fsi becomes clear when comparing the full calculation with the one without fsi ( dashed line ) .",
    "since the @xmath92 quark can not be absorbed in medium the fsi can just increase the @xmath2 yield via processes like @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) for example . with decreasing formation time the primarily produced pions have a greater chance to produce @xmath2 in the fsi .",
    "as a consequence of this , a shorter formation time will lead to an increase of the nuclear @xmath2 photoproduction cross section as can be seen from the dotted line .",
    "an enhancement of the @xmath2 production cross section due to fsi can not be explained by purely absorptive fsi as in simple glauber theory where it would necessarily be interpreted as being due to a longer formation time of the @xmath2 .",
    "high energy photoproduction off nuclei offers a promising possibility to study the physics of hadron formation .",
    "necessary for such studies is a reliable model of the fsi to extract the formation time from the production cross sections . whereas glauber models allow for a straightforward implementation of the nuclear shadowing effect they usually have the disadvantage of a purely absorptive treatment of the fsi .",
    "as we have shown the latter can lead to a wrong estimate of the formation time .",
    "a more realistic treatment of the fsi is possible within a coupled channel transport model .",
    "we have presented a method to combine such an incoherent treatment of fsi with coherence length effects in the entrance channel which can easily be extended to higher energies and virtual photons .",
    "we have shown that in particular the production of mesons with long mean free path will be affected by the coupled channel effects in the fsi .",
