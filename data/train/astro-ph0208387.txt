    "solar supergranulation , which was first described more than 40 years ago by @xcite , has remained difficult to explain . while it appears to be similar to the granulation , several observations , such as the anomalous flows obtained using correlation tracking or similar methods ( e.g. @xcite , in the following bs ) ,",
    "challenge the interpretation as a simple convective phenomenon .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the supergranulation has a wave - like component and observational evidence for this was recently reported by @xcite ( gds in the following ) .",
    "it has been the cause of some concern that the wave like character has not been observed previously , given the many measurements of the rotation rate of the supergranulation and attempts to determine why it appears to be anomalous .",
    "a likely explanation is that it was obscured by the limitations of the surface doppler shift data .",
    "supergranular motions are predominantly horizontal near the photosphere .",
    "let @xmath1 be the velocity in the longitudinal ( @xmath2 ) direction and @xmath3 the velocity in the latitude ( @xmath4 ) direction .",
    "the observed doppler velocity @xmath5 is then given by @xmath6 under the assumption that the observations are made in the equatorial plane ( i.e. that b0 = 0 ) at a large distance from the sun .",
    "for the @xmath1 component , in particular , the projection leads to a large modulation of the signal as the sun rotates and to a significant spreading of the power in the frequency domain .",
    "the data used here are the same as those used in bs , which provides further details .",
    "they consist of a 60 day sequence of 1024@xmath7 full disk doppler velocity images obtained by the mdi instrument @xcite on the soho spacecraft , covering the time period 1996 may 24 to 1996 july 22 .",
    "these images were derotated and averaged to a 60 minute cadence , remapped to a uniform grid in longitude and latitude and binned down to have a resolution of 1200 points covering 360@xmath8 of longitude and 600 points in latitude between @xmath9 .",
    "a temporal average was removed as part of this process .",
    "strips in longitude were extracted , multiplied by a weighting function , tracked at a latitude dependent rate , zero padded to 360@xmath8 by 12@xmath8 and passed through a 3 dimensional fourier transform .",
    "the weighting function is a product of a function of @xmath4 and a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the function of @xmath4 is 1 for @xmath10 , 0 for @xmath11 and falls off as a cosine bell for @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the distance from the target latitude .",
    "two weighting functions in @xmath2 were applied .",
    "one is optimized for recovering @xmath1 , the other for recovering @xmath3 .",
    "the first weighting function is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an apodization function which is 0 for @xmath16 and for @xmath17 , 1 for @xmath18 and cosine bell apodized for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the second weighting function is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is only apodized between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the small bias of 0.01 was added to avoid singularities .",
    "figure [ pphi ] shows the power as a function of direction of propagation .",
    "note that there is significantly more power in the prograde than in the retrograde direction , consistent with the findings of gds .",
    "also there is little power in the n - s direction where gds did observe significant power .",
    "since the method used by gds is sensitive to both components of the velocity this indicates that the displacement , at least at the surface , is almost entirely in the direction of propagation .",
    "given the above waves in the @xmath2 direction should show modulation given by @xmath15 when using the @xmath25 weighting and waves in the @xmath4 direction should be modulated by @xmath22 when using @xmath26 . for other directions",
    "the modulation is more complex and only waves propagating near the longitude and latitude directions are studied here .",
    "the velocity projection also means that waves traveling in latitude are essentially unobservable at the equator . at high latitudes",
    "the foreshortening becomes a problem .",
    "figure [ plotx ] shows examples of the resulting power spectra .",
    "note the different power level in prograde waves ( lower right ) and retrograde waves ( upper right ) in the left panel . in the right panel",
    "there is excess power in the southbound waves ( upper right ) relative to the northbound waves ( lower right ) .",
    "the advection of a wave pattern will , at a given azimuth , lead to two peaks in the power spectra at frequencies @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mode frequency , @xmath29 is the wavenumber ( given here in terms of the equivalent degree @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the solar radius ) and @xmath32 is the component of the velocity in the direction of propagation .    to quantify the properties of the waves , power spectra at selected @xmath29 were extracted and a model consisting of two lorentzians and a background @xmath33 was fitted to them using a maximum likelihood algorithm . here",
    "@xmath34 are the amplitudes , @xmath35 is the the ( common ) width of the modes and @xmath36 is a constant background , the dispersion relation may be derived as @xmath37 and the flow velocity from @xmath38 . to account for the projection factor and the finite observation time ,",
    "the model is convolved with an estimate of the appropriate window function .",
    "the power spectra are binned by a factor of 5 in @xmath39 , rebinned to a uniform grid in @xmath29 and azimuth and directions within @xmath40 of the desired direction are averaged before being fitted .",
    "this averaging ensures that the log of the resulting power spectra is close to normally distributed with a uniform variance , allowing for a simple maximum likelihood algorithm and stable fits .",
    "the inaccuracy in the parameters caused by the averaging over azimuth is negligible .",
    "figure [ disp ] shows the dispersion relation for the waves traveling in longitude at the equator .",
    "the solid line shows the fit of a power law over the interval @xmath41 , which gives an exponent of 0.56 .",
    "points below @xmath42 have proven difficult to fit and may be unreliable .",
    "figure [ disp ] also shows the rotation rate at the equator , which is almost independent of @xmath43 , allowing the results to be averaged over @xmath43 , as done in figure [ flow ] , which also shows the meridional flows .",
    "finally figures [ power ] and [ anis ] shows the amplitude , linewidth and anisotropy .",
    "possibly the main result is to confirm the results of gds . given the differing analysis techniques this represents a significant confirmation and lays to rest the concerns based on the fact that the phenomenon had not been observed previously in surface doppler shift data .    while not physically motivated it is interesting that the frequencies appear to follow a square root quite well .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ disp ] the dispersion relation at @xmath44 is quite similar to that at the equator in both directions .",
    "the small variation of the rotation rate with @xmath43 is consistent with a simple depth independent flow .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the numbers derived from the same data in bs , which varied by 10nhz between @xmath43=50 and @xmath43=200 , and which were difficult to explain .",
    "the rotation rate derived here is remarkably close to the magnetic tracer rate of @xcite .",
    "the similarity may be related to the fact that the advection of the small magnetic elements appear to be influenced by the supergranulation .",
    "this similarity is quite unlike the results in bs , in which the rotation rate , at least at low @xmath43 , exceeded that of the plasma at any depth .",
    "this lends further credence to the idea that the flows inferred here represent physical advection rates .",
    "the meridional flow results appear to be reliable to at least @xmath45 latitude with a clear turnover between @xmath46 and @xmath47 and no sign of a second cell .",
    "note that the meridional flow is not perfectly antisymmetric across the equator . as shown this",
    "is largely explained by a p angle error caused by the misalignment of the mdi instrument on the soho spacecraft @xcite and by the difference between the carrington elements and the true rotation axis of the sun @xcite .",
    "an error in the rotation axis causes part of the rotation velocity to be misidentified as meridional flow .",
    "figure [ power ] shows that the power peaks around @xmath48 , as previously seen .",
    "the linewidth appears to be an increasing function of @xmath43 , possibly indicating that smaller scale features damp more quickly .",
    "the increase for @xmath49 is likely an artifact of the difficulty in fitting low degree features .",
