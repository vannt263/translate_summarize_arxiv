    "beijing spectrometer ( bes ) at beijing electron - positron collider ( bepc ) recently reports an evidence for the existence of the @xmath0 particle in @xmath7 decays . in the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum in the process of @xmath9 they found a low mass enhancement and",
    "the detailed analysis strongly favors that the spin - parity is @xmath10 and the statistical significance for the existence of the @xmath0 particle is about 18 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the bes measured values of the @xmath0 mass and width are : @xmath11 and the branching ratio is @xmath12    the @xmath0 particle has been absent for many years in the review of particle physics@xcite by the particle data group ( pdg ) , however in the recent years there has been a revival of interest in studying the light scalar - isoscalar meson , the @xmath0 particle , as a broad resonance@xciteexperimentally and theoretically . a direct experimental evidence for the @xmath0 meson is reported recently by the fermilab e791 collaboration @xcite in the d - meson decay process , @xmath13 .",
    "theoretically , @xmath0 meson can play important roles in some problems . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 can be regarded as the dominant contribution to the @xmath14 current . moreover , using @xmath15 mass and width from e791 , some people@xcite investage @xmath0 contribution to @xmath16 and find it can explain the recent data from cleo and babar collaboration .    in this paper , we study phenomenologically the decay process @xmath17 and discuss the couplings @xmath2 and @xmath6 . by taking the meson wavefunctions of @xmath0 and @xmath5 to be similar to that of @xmath3 and @xmath18 , and using the perturbative qcd technique , we calculate the decay constant @xmath19 . our theoretical prediction is shown to be within the range of experimental value @xmath6 .",
    "given the data on the @xmath0 mass and width measured by bes in eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) we study the coupling constants @xmath2 and @xmath6 . for a two - body decay of particle @xmath20 into final states @xmath21 and @xmath22 the decay width is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is 3-momentum of the final state in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) . for @xmath25 , the @xmath0 meson decays @xmath26 into @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore isospin conservation requires for two thirds of the time the final states be the charged pions .",
    "so we have : @xmath28 using bes data on the @xmath0 s mass , width , and the experimental value of the @xmath3 mass , we obtain : @xmath29 this number is surprisingly consistent with the theoretical value of the linear sigma model@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pion decay constant . in eq.(6 )",
    "the @xmath0 mass is taken from the bes measurement in eq.(1 ) .    to get the phenomenological value of @xmath32",
    ", we use the full three - body decay width ( for example , see @xcite ) : @xmath33 where factor @xmath34 is the phase space integral of the corresponding two - body decay subprocess and @xmath35 and in eq .",
    "( 7 ) @xmath36 is the co - moving resonance width where @xmath37 and @xmath38 mev the experimental value in eq.(1 ) .    with the experimental values of @xmath2 in eq.(5 ) and the branching ratio in eq.(2 ) , solving eq .",
    "( 7 ) gives rise to @xmath39",
    "in this section we follow closely the calculation of the exclusive decays of @xmath41 in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the decay of @xmath42 .",
    "the decay amplitude consists of two parts .",
    "one is the hard decay amplitude of the three - gluon modes and another is the bound - state matrix elements of outgoing mesons .    in general the decay amplitude of @xmath43",
    "can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the constituent s fractional longitudinal momenta which satisfy @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in eq.(11 ) @xmath50 is a non - relativistic approximate wave function of the @xmath7 meson , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the distribution amplitude of the @xmath0 and @xmath5 wave functions respectively and @xmath53 is the charm quark mass .",
    "@xmath54 is the hard decay amplitude of the charm quark pairs into two light quark - antiquark pairs , which is defined by @xmath55 there are twelve feynmann diagrams shown in fig . 1 contributing to @xmath56 , which are all explicitly shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the landau rules",
    ", it is found that both infrared and collinear divergences exist in every diagram .",
    "fortunately , through a use of color neutrality and collinear ward identities , one can prove that when summing up all of the diagrams , the divergences cancel @xcite .    for quarkonia @xmath7 ,",
    "the non - relativistic approximate wave function @xmath50 can be determined by the decay @xmath57 , @xmath58    according to the brodsky - huang - lepage @xcite , the light - cone wavefunction of a hadron is essentially determined by the off - shell energy variable .",
    "thus , for the light scalar meson , @xmath0 , we assume the light - cone wave function to be the same as that of the pion @xcite @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the relative transverse momentum of the final meson , @xmath61 is @xmath62 quark mass and @xmath46 are the constituent s fractional longitudinal momenta . @xmath63 and @xmath64 are two free parameters which are taken to be @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite . for the wave function of the vector meson , @xmath5 ,",
    "we assume it to be the same as that of the @xmath18 meson@xcite @xmath67,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are taken to be @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which can be determined from two constraints@xcite .",
    "the distribution amplitude @xmath72 in eq.(11 ) is defined as @xmath73 making use of the wave function of @xmath0 and @xmath5 in eqs.(14 ) and ( 15 ) we have : @xmath74,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath75 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath76 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in deriving the integration of eq.(16 ) , we have ignored the qcd evolution on the distribution amplitude since the charm quark @xmath53 is not large and the evolution effects are not significant in this energy range .",
    "thus the distribution amplitude is essentially determined by the non - perturbative model@xcite . in fig.2",
    "we show the distribution amplitudes of @xmath0 , @xmath5 .    with the values of the parameters",
    "@xmath77 given above , we obtain the coupling constant @xmath4 responsible for the decay @xmath78 , @xmath79 one can see that our theoretical prediction on @xmath4 above agrees within the errors with the experimental value @xmath80 in eq.(10 ) .",
    "in this paper we have used the new bes experimental evidence for the @xmath0 particle and studied its properties in the process of @xmath81 .",
    "we have obtained the phenomelogical values of the coupling constants @xmath2 and @xmath82 , then the theoretical prediction on the @xmath83 in the linear @xmath0 model .",
    "we show that linear @xmath0 model gives rise to a reasonable description of the @xmath0 decay into @xmath3 s .",
    "we have calculated @xmath6 by the perturbative qcd and in this approach we take the wave functions of the @xmath0 and @xmath5 to be similar to that of @xmath3 and @xmath18 . our theoretical predictions and the experimental values of the @xmath6 are shown to be consistent .",
