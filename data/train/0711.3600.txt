    "the idea for the correspondence between the large n limit of gauge theories and strings emerged over thirty years ago @xcite and since then many attempts for explicit realization have been made .",
    "one of the most promissing so far was provided by maldacena who conjectured the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "since then this became a topical area and many fascinating discoveries were made over the last decade .",
    "one of the predictions of the correspondence is the conjectured one - to - one map between the spectrum of string theory on @xmath5 and the spectrum of anomalous dimensions of gauge invariant operators in the @xmath6 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory .",
    "the vast majority of papers were on qualitative and quantitative description of @xmath7 sym theory with @xmath8 gauge group by making use of the string sigma model on @xmath9 .",
    "this special case is remarkable with its classical integrability @xcite and it is hardly believed that the integrability is preserved at quantum level as well .",
    "thus , one can put forwards the important issue of derivation of the s - matrix and study the main features of the string model and its dual .",
    "this issue is important because one of the predictions of the correspondence is the equivalence between the spectrum of string theory on @xmath5 and the spectrum of anomalous dimensions of gauge invariant operators .",
    "there has been a good deal of success recently in comparing the energies of semiclassical strings and the anomalous dimensions of the gauge theory operators .",
    "however , on one side string theory on @xmath9 is highly non - linear and on another the tools at hand to study gauge theory are limited mainly to perturbation theory .",
    "having in mind the duality , i.e. complementarity of the validity regions of the perturbation theories , the proof of the conjecture becomes a real challenge .",
    "luckily , there exists a wide region where one can trust quasi - classical considerations and compare the corresponding spectra on both sides .",
    "integrability provides powerful tools for calculating the key features on each side of the correspondence .",
    "there are several approaches using simplifications of the non - linear system we are dealing with . an important proposal by berenstein , maldacena and nastase @xcite made the first step beyond the supergravity approximation in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "they showed how certain operators in sym theory can be related to string theory in the pp - wave limit in a certain way .",
    "namely , it was suggested that string theory in pp - wave background gives good approximation of a certain class of `` nearly '' chiral operators and vice versa . since string theory in the pp - wave background is exactly solvable ,",
    "a lot of information for the ads / cft correspondence was extracted .",
    "superstring theory on @xmath5 is integrable at the classical level and there exist strong indications that it happens also at the quantum level .",
    "nevertheless , it is a highly non - trivial task to find the exact s - matrix of the theory and to study the duality in its full extent .",
    "the difficulties are not only of technical nature but also conceptual .",
    "moreover , one must keep considerations such that one can check the results on both sides of the correspondence .",
    "the latter assumes certain limits @xcite , allowing reliability of the semiclassical results on both sides . in this case",
    "the techniques of integrable systems have become useful to study the ads / cft correspondence in detail .",
    "for instance , the remarkable observation by minahan and zarembo @xcite made it possible to relate gauge theory side of the correspondence to some integrable spin chain ( at least to leading orders ) .",
    "thus , the question of relating string theory side to some spin chain and then compare to the gauge theory side becomes very important .",
    "if so , the integrability of spin chains would provide a powerful tool for investigation of ads / cft correspondence .",
    "discussing the integrability properties of the superstring on @xmath5 , one should point out several key developments leading to the current understanding .",
    "one of them is the gauge theory s - matrix introduced in @xcite and derived in its full form in @xcite . in @xcite the authors consider bethe ansatz for quantum strings and introduced the dressing phase as well as the `` symplectic '' form of the charges appearing in the exponential .",
    "the power of this approach was further utilized in @xcite leading to important results .",
    "another step forward was done by maldacena and hofman @xcite who were able to map spin chain `` magnon '' states to a specific class of rotating semiclassical strings on @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this result was soon generalized to magnon bound states @xcite , dual to strings on @xmath11 with two and three non - vanishing angular momenta .",
    "magnon solutions and the dispersion relations for strings in beta - deformed backgrounds were obtained in @xcite .",
    "the applicability of the considerations is restricted to the case of large quantum numbers , i.e. quasiclassical approximations .",
    "although we assume infinitely large energy @xmath12 and momentum @xmath13 , the difference @xmath14 is finite like in the case of the pp - wave limit .",
    "remarkably enough , due to the integrability on the gauge theory side one is able to obtain the corresponding s - matrix explicitly @xcite .",
    "although similar in dealing with infinitely large quantum numbers , the two pictures , namely the pp - wave limit and the giant magnon sector , are a bit different .",
    "to see this one can use simple scaling arguments . while in the first case the angular momentum @xmath13 goes to infinity as @xmath15 and the product @xmath16 is kept fixed ( for which @xmath17 has to be vanishing ) , in the magnon case the momentum @xmath17 is kept fixed . in the first case we have point - like strings and we are at the bottom of the @xmath14 scale , while in the second case the string spike is essentially not a point - like object with higher @xmath14 . following this logic it is natural to look for string solutions interpolating between these two sectors . in a recent paper maldacena and",
    "swanson @xcite suggested another limit , called near flat space ( nfs ) limit , which is interpolating between the two regions above was considered before in @xcite in the context of @xcite , while the general discussion of this limit on which our study is based appeared in @xcite . ] . in doing a penrose limit of the geometry",
    "we perform a certain boost in the vicinity of a given null geodesics .",
    "the limit is taken in such a way that the product @xmath18 is fixed but the space becomes of pp - wave type .",
    "the authors of @xcite suggest a weaker boosting and the limit is taken with @xmath19 fixed .",
    "the resulting sigma model is much simpler than that of the @xmath5 superstring and more complicated than in the pp - wave limit .",
    "a remarkable feature of the reduced model is that , as compared to the pp - wave case , it keeps much more information of the original theory . for instance , it is integrable and the lax connection can be obtained from the original one by taking the limit , it possess the same supersymmetry algebra with a phase originating from the hopf algebra structure of the problem .",
    "the corresponding s matrix was also conjectured .",
    "the worldsheet scattering of the reduced model and some other properties were subsequently studied in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the discussion above was focused on superstrings on @xmath5 background and its reductions via certain limits and identifying the corresponding sectors of its dual @xmath6 sym theory .",
    "it is of importance , however , to extend these techniques to other less symmetric backgrounds that have gauge theory duals .",
    "one step in this direction was given in @xcite where the authors considered the nfs limit of spaces where the @xmath20 part of the geometry is replaced by certain sasaki - einstein spaces .",
    "for instance , it is known that spaces like @xmath21 and @xmath22 have @xmath1 cft duals .",
    "remarkably , the near flat space limit of all these spaces is of the same type as in @xcite . since the latter is integrable",
    ", one can hope that the corresponding theory may contain , at least , an integrable subsector .",
    "in this paper we study the near flat limit reduction of string theory on the maldacena - nunez background @xcite .",
    "this background is intersting in several ways .",
    "first of all its dual is @xmath1 gauge theory with interesting properties and it is supposed to describe aspects of certain hadron physics @xcite and other qcd issues .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the near flat space limit of @xcite . in section 3",
    "we review the maldacena - nunez background and its pp - wave limit . using a consistent truncation to a certain subsector",
    "we show that there exist magnon excitations of string theory in the mn background .",
    "after that we perform the nfs limit ( of bosonic part ) of string theory in this background . in the concluding section we comment on the result , its implications and possible developments .",
    "in this short section we will review the procedure of taking the near flat space limit of type iib string theory on @xmath5 space suggested in @xcite . as we already discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the idea is to weaken the penrose limit so that more structures of the original theory get preserved .",
    "the first step is to find the null geodesics with respect to which the pp - wave limit can be taken .",
    "we start with the standard metric of @xmath5 in global coordinates @xmath23\\ ] ] where each of the unit 3-spheres , we take below @xmath24 from the spherical part , can be parameterized by @xmath25 the light - like directions are characterized by covariantly constant null vectors @xmath26 the @xmath20 part of the null geodesics is parameterized by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , i.e. in our case this is the equator of the five - sphere .",
    "now we boost the worldsheet coordinates and expand about the geodesics ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this amounts to a redefinition of the fields as follows @xmath30 where we switched to light - cone worldsheat coordinates @xmath31 .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is related to the radius of @xmath20 ( and @xmath33 as well ) via @xmath34 .",
    "the near flat space limit is , as in the penrose limit , taking @xmath35 . in the lagrangian the leading terms are divergent , @xmath36 , but since they are total derivatives they can be dropped .",
    "the relevant ( bosonic ) part of the lagrangian thus becomes @xmath37\\ ] ] where we skipped the fermionic part and used the notation @xmath38 for coordinates in @xmath33 and @xmath39 for those in the @xmath20 part .",
    "the reduced model has two conserved chiral currents @xmath40 the right - moving conformal invariance in preserved since its generator @xmath41 is conserved , i.e. @xmath42 . the left - moving conformal invariance however is broken , since @xmath43 .",
    "one can still impose the virasoro constraints requiring @xmath44 this can also be considered as a gauge fixing condition .    it is useful now to make a change of variables @xmath45 for completeness we write down the complete gauge fixed lagrangian @xmath46 \\notag \\\\ & + i\\psi_+\\p_-\\psi_+ + i\\psi_-\\p_-\\psi_- + i\\psi_-\\pi\\psi_+ + i(\\vec y^2-\\vec x^2)\\psi_-\\p_-\\psi_- \\notag \\\\ & -\\psi_-(\\p_-z^j\\gamma^j+\\p_-y^{j'}\\gamma^{j'})(z^i\\gamma^i - y^{i'}\\gamma^{i'})\\psi_- \\notag \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{24}\\big[\\psi_-\\gamma^{ij}\\psi_-\\psi_-\\gamma^{ij}\\psi_- \\psi_-\\gamma^{i'j'}\\psi_-\\psi_-\\gamma^{i'j'}\\psi_\\big]\\big\\}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last expression a simple rescaling of @xmath47 was used .",
    "the indices @xmath48 and @xmath49 correspond to the transverse directions in the anti - de sitter and the spherical parts , respectively .",
    "the background we will consider can be produced by a stack of n d5-branes located at the origin of the transversal coordinate @xmath50 and partially wrapping a supersymmetric cycle inside a calabi - yau three - fold , i.e the brane is wrapped on a two sphere of radius @xmath51 .",
    "we want to preserve some supersymmetry , i.e. one must twist the normal bundle , which is achieved by embedding the spin connection into the r - symmetry group @xmath52 of d5-branes .",
    "the embedding @xmath53 preserves four supercharges and thus the unwrapped sector of the world - volume contains the @xmath1 sym field theory in four dimensions .",
    "it is also assumed that in this procedure some world - volume fields become sufficiently massive to decouple .",
    "the resulting geometry can be summarized as follows .",

    "this term is proportional to @xmath139 but after the redefinitions and overall multiplication of the lagrangian by @xmath32 terms proportional to @xmath140 appear .",

    "however all the terms are multiplied by @xmath145 or @xmath146 .",
    "but due to @xmath147 and therefore it can be decomposed to well defined finite terms multiplied by @xmath148 or @xmath149 . in the limit @xmath35",
    "one might expect that these fast oscillating factors vanish because their average values are zero . actually this can be explicitly demonstrated .",
    "we have terms of the form @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a well define finite function of its arguments .",
    "instead of one can consider the more general expression @xmath152 where @xmath153 is independent of @xmath32 .",
    "this can be written also as @xmath154 the first term in the last equality is a total derivative and can be integrated out .",
    "the second term is now of order @xmath155 . repeating this procedure @xmath156 or more times we will end up with @xmath157 where @xmath158 and therefore the @xmath120-term vanishes in the limit @xmath35 ( up to total derivatives ) .    in our case",
    "@xmath159 is just @xmath160 , so this terms does not contribute to the near flat space limit .",
    "therefore , since the whole @xmath120-term vanishes , the contributions to the lagrangian come only from the explicit part of the metric .",

    "indeed , using that in this case @xmath189 and repeating the above steps we obtain the following lagrangian @xmath190 analyzing the eom one obtains the following chiral conserved currents @xmath191 we can again further gauge fix the action using @xmath192 the final form of the effective lagrangian is given by @xmath193\\partial_{-}\\vec{y}\\partial_{-}\\vec{y } \\notag \\\\   & + \\partial_{+}\\vec{z}\\partial_{-}\\vec{z}+\\left[-m_0 ^ 2(\\frac{b^2}{2}+\\frac{2}{3})z^{2}+m_0 ^ 2 \\left(r^{2}+\\frac{1}{9}\\left(z_{2}^{2}+z_{3}^{2}\\right)\\right)\\right]\\partial_{-}\\vec{z}\\partial_{-}\\vec{z } \\notag \\\\   & + \\partial_{+}\\vec{r}\\partial_{-}\\vec{r}+\\left[-m_0 ^ 2(\\frac{b^2}{2}+\\frac{2}{3})z^{2}+m_0 ^ 2 \\left(r^{2}+\\frac{1}{9}\\left(z_{2}^{2}+z_{3}^{2}\\right)\\right)\\right]\\partial_{-}\\vec{r}\\partial_{-}\\vec{r}\\notag\\\\   & -\\frac{m_0 ^ 2}{9}\\frac{z_{2}^{2}+z_{3}^{2}}{4}-m_0 ^ 2\\frac{r^{2}}{4}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth to note again that although complicated , this lagrangian is much simpler than the original one .",
    "it has several advantages .",
    "first of all , since it is quite similar to the reduced model considered in@xcite , it is tempting to expect that it admits a lax connection although it is not clear whether the original theory is integrable .",
    "this however can be conclusively stated only after inclusion of the fermionic part and thorough analysis of the whole model .",
    "secondly , the analysis of the reduced model will be much easier than the original one .",
    "it can be performed along the lines of @xcite .",
    "if the above conjectures are true , the s  matrix is expected to be similar to the one conjectured in @xcite .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , string backgrounds with less supersymmetry are of great interest , especially because their gauge theory duals are closely related to qcd .",
    "since superstring theory on known backgrounds is highly non - linear and difficult to deal with , some limiting procedures proved useful and allow to extract more information for the models .",
    "one of the limits widely used in the last years is the so - called pp - wave limit .",
    "it is very attractive because the resulting theory is exactly solvable even on the quantized level .",
    "the issues concerning the validity of the correspondence have also been studied .",
    "although exactly solvable , some of the important properties and structure of the original theory get lost due to the limit .",
    "one possibility to weaken the pp - wave limit and to preserve many of the key features of superstring theory on @xmath5 background was proposed by maldacena and swanson .",
    "they called this procedure taking near flat space limit .",
    "being the string dual of a @xmath1 gauge theory related to hadron physics , superstring theory on the maldacena - nunez background is of particular importance .",
    "inspired by its importance , in this paper we considered the near flat space limit of string theory on the maldacena - nunez background .",
    "it is conjectured that , as in the case of string theory on the @xmath5 background , many of the key features of the original theory should be presented in the reduced model .",
    "our considerations show that the reduced model in this background is of the same type as the one obtained from the nfs limit of @xmath5 .",
    "the bosonic part of the gauge fixed lagrangian of the reduced model contain again `` mass terms '' .",
    "the latter are composed differently from the case considered in @xcite . based on the structural similarity to the case in @xcite",
    ", we expect that the near flat space limit reduction of string theory on the maldacena - nunez background is integrable .",
    "since in this paper we consider only bosonic part of the model , one can not make conclusive statements without inclusion of the fermionic part and thorough analysis of the resulting dynamical system .",
    "certainly further investigations along this line must be done in order to to establish integrability .",
    "a second conjecture based on our results and the findings in @xcite is that , as in the case of the pp - wave limit , the near flat space limit reduced models have an universal structure - that of @xcite .",
    "if true , the techniques of @xcite will be also universal within the class of nfs reduced models .",
    "we considered also the softly broken model which in the limit of small @xmath50 slightly differs from the supersymmetric case .",
    "the resulting nfs limit parameterized by a parameter @xmath187 $ ] has the very same structure and gives further support to the above conjectures .",
    "there are several directions for further generalizations of these studies .",
    "first of all , it would be interesting , to perform detailed analysis of the integrability of the reduced model . guided by the close similarity of the structure of the ( bosonic ) lagrangian obtained here and that in @xcite , to look for a lax connection for the gauge fixed model and to perform an analysis along the lines of , say @xcite .",
    "secondly , one can apply these techniques to study string sigma models in so - called beta - deformed backgrounds introduced first in @xcite , assuming that the nfs limit interpolates between pp - wave and magnon sectors of the theory @xcite .",
    "the expectations that some key features of the original model survive the nfs limit must also find answers through further investigations .",
    "one should note that in this study we considered only the bosonic part of the theory .",
    "the near flat limit of the fermionic part is much more difficult due to the presence of non - trivial rr field , but deserves detailed study which is currently under investigation .",
    "although there is some progress in our understanding of the role of the integrable structures in ads / cft , or more generally string / gauge theory duality , much has still to be done .",
    "we thank s. guttenberg for useful discussion at an early stage of the project .",
    "many thanks to gleb arutyunov for valuable comments , correspondence and pointing out some references .",
