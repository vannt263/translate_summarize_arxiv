    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe the adiabatic implementation of quantum gates via ce and several adiabatic quantum search approaches .",

    "the two previous versions of the adiabatic grover s algorithm are based on oracular hamiltonians , which we take here to be operators able to recognize the correct answer of a problem  @xcite .",
    "this is indeed the case if one chooses a hamiltonian composed of an operator @xmath68 in the form @xmath69 .",

    "however , the adiabatic evolution can be sped up through shortcuts to adiabaticity via counter - diabatic hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental idea underlying these shortcuts to adiabaticity is to add a new contribution @xmath82 , called _",

    "the goal of the counter - diabatic term @xmath82 in the hamiltonian @xmath89is exactly to eliminate the diabatic contributions of @xmath90 .",
    "thus , if the system is initially prepared in the ground state of @xmath91 , then the system will deterministically evolve to the instantaneous ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath83 with no constraints over the evolution time .",
    "note that , in general , one would need to be able to explicitly calculate all the eigenstates of @xmath83 to derive a shortcut to adiabaticity using the counter - diabatic driving .",
    "however , this may not be a hard requirement in the case of superadiabatic versions of circuit implementations , where one - qubit rotations and two - qubit entangling gates are enough to achieve qc universality  @xcite .",

    "indeed , this energy - time complementarity can be formally discussed through the quantum speed limit  @xcite , which suggests that the superadiabatic evolution time is compatible with arbitrarily short time intervals ( implying into corresponding arbitrarily large energies )  @xcite , while the adiabatic evolution time obeys the lower bound @xmath107 , with @xmath108 associated with the energy gap and @xmath109 @xcite .",

    "<S> we discuss the energetic cost of superadiabatic models of quantum computation . specifically , we investigate the energy - time complementarity in general transitionless controlled evolutions and in shortcuts to the adiabatic quantum search over an unstructured list . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the additional energy resources required by superadiabaticity for arbitrary controlled evolutions can be minimized by using probabilistic dynamics , so that the optimal success probability is fixed by the choice of the evolution time . in the case of analog quantum search , we show that the superadiabatic approach induces a non - oracular counter - diabatic hamiltonian , with the same energy - time complexity as equivalent adiabatic implementations . </S>"
