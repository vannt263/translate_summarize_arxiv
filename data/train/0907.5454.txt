    "polymers are often incompatible .",
    "when they are mixed together , an interface between them will occur . because many properties of the blends are finally determined by the thickness of the interface and the concentration profile of the polymer across the interface , the equilibrium properties and dynamics of the interface attracted increased attention and gained widespread studies .",
    "the broadening of initially sharp interface between two types of polymers is of considerable interest .",
    "self - consistent field theory is a powerful method in the study of inhomogenous equilibrium systems @xcite",
    ". it can give detailed distribution of the monomer concentration across interface and specify other thermodynamic and structure quantities of interest . in order to study the kinetic pathway towards its equilibrium state . a method called  dynamic mean - field theory \" ( dmft ) @xcite or ",
    "dynamic density functional theory \" ( ddft ) @xcite was developed .",
    "it is a generalized time - dependent ginzburg - landau theory for conserved order parameters .",
    "the volume fraction ( concentration ) is often chosen as the order parameter in polymer blends . in this theory ,",
    "the free energy is calculated using the mean - field approximation , i.e. , in each time step , the concentration and the potential should satisfy the self - consistent equations .",
    "this free energy is more exact than the flory - hugins type and the ginzberg - landau - wilson type free energy which are both a local free energy plus the square gradient term of the concentration . in dmft or ddft ,",
    "the onsager kinetic coefficients are crucial quantities .",
    "various chain dynamics and interactions will result different forms of kinetic coefficients . a simple one is the local coupling form which neglects the non - local interactions .",
    "in fact , sometimes the kinetic coefficients are assumed to be constants . if the dynamics of polymer chains are described by rouse model , a different form of kinetic coefficient",
    "will be obtained , and the coupling between concentrations can be approximately described by debye function in a homogenous homopolymer melt @xcite . in the reptation regime , many researchers argued that the forms of the kinetic coefficient were the same as that for rouse dynamics in a homogeneous polymer melt @xcite , i.e. , proportional to the debye function .",
    "however , maurits and fraaije @xcite found that the kinetic coefficients of the two different dynamics are not the same though do not differ very much .",
    "wang and shi @xcite studied the interdiffusion process between incompatible polymers using the flory - huggins type free energy plus the square gradient term of the concentration .",
    "the growing of the interfacial width @xmath0 obeys the general scaling form @xmath1 .",
    "it is found that the exponent @xmath2 is smaller that @xmath3 for all the cases in their studies . as the square gradient approximation is only valid near the critical point",
    ", it is appropriate to obtain a more exact free energy which should also be valid far away from the critical point .",
    "the dmft is the desirable method . using dmft with the local coupling approximation , yeung and",
    "shi @xcite studied the dynamics of polymer interfaces .",
    "they found that the exponent @xmath2 is about 0.25 at early times , and is independent of the flory - huggins parameter @xmath4 and the chain length .",
    "the interfacial width saturates to its equilibrium thickness at long times .",
    "many experiments also focused on the interdiffusion process of a system with an initially sharp interface @xcite .",
    "these experiments found that the broadening of the interface obeys an power law at early times , and it needs a very long time to saturate to its equilibrium thickness .",
    "it was also found that the exponent @xmath2 was in a range from 0.25 to 0.4 , and decreases as the temperature is lowered @xcite .",
    "one argued that the quick increase of the initial broadening is expected to be controlled by the fast single - chain mobility , while the long time saturation to the equilibrium thickness is due to the large - scale hydrodynamic flow @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of polymer interfaces are often described by the time evolution of the concentration of the chains across the interfaces . in dmft , this can be done by solving the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation which the concentration satisfies . as this equation is usually solved numerically in real space , the onsager coefficient is approximated as a local coupling form for the simplicity and saving time in calculation @xcite .",
    "since the concentration is a conserved quantity and it is linear rated to the auxiliary potential field @xcite , we expect that the auxiliary potential field is also conserved .",
    "the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation with respect to concentration can be transformed to the form in which the auxiliary potential field is treated as the variable .",
    "then we can obtain the external potential dynamic ( epd ) model , as the equation is for the auxiliary potential fields .",
    "the epd model is first proposed by maurits and fraaije .",
    "there are some advantages of the epd method compared to dmft method @xcite .",
    "it incorporates a non - local coupling onsager coefficient corresponding to the rouse dynamics . in the spectral space , this can be realized through a local onsager coefficient .",
    "also , it is proved that numerically the epd equation converges more easily and faster . in the present work",
    "we adopt the epd method .",
    "polymer chains in the real system are always polydisperse , and polydispersity may play important roles in determining the properties of materials .",
    "polydispersity enriches the phase behavior at equilibrium @xcite and decreases the free energy barrier of nucleation in meta - stable state of polymer blends @xcite .",

    "are described by the same prescribed function @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the degrees of polymerization , thus they have the same number- and weight - average chain lengths . also both a and b monomers are assumed to have the same monomeric volume @xmath7 and kuhn lengths @xmath8 . in this section",

    "in order to study the effect of polydispersity on the formation of interface , we first investigated the evolution of interface in the case of monodisperse a / b blend .",
    "the model we used in the monodisperse case was a simplified one of the present polydisperse model , which is also a nonlocal coupling one .",

    "this is why an enhancement of @xmath123 above the equilibrium value on the a - rich side and a depletion on the a - poor side appear in the calculation .",
    "the calculation indicates that bumps are larger at smaller @xmath122 , while they are smaller at larger @xmath122 , and in the course of time the bumps move to the phase boundaries .    what we are interested in is the growth law of interfacial width with respect to time .",
    "the density across the interface is not homogeneous , thus the definition of the interfacial width is not unique . as a quantitative measure of the interfacial width , we followed yeung and shi , and also steiner et al .",
    "@xcite and chose the inverse of the maximum slope of @xmath72 at the interface @xmath132here , @xmath133 is the difference between the bulk value of @xmath72 in the two equilibrium phases .",
    "it is obvious that this definition is sensitive to the local structure of the interface . other definition , e.g. taking into account the entire structure of the interface ,",
    "can alternatively be chosen , however , it dose not change the scaling relations .    figure 2 shows the interfacial width defined in eq .",

    "an more exact form of the free energy , the self - consistent mean field free energy with the cahn - hilliard dynamics also demonstrated @xmath146 .",

    "we take into account the nonlocal coupling between segments of a single chain , hence , there exists another characteristic length , the correlation length .",
    "it is because of this correlation length , a simple scaling analysis with one characteristic length can not predict an exponent of 0.38 .",
    "an prefactor of @xmath142 is also a reflection of the existence of another characteristic length .",
    "this will be more precise in the polydisperse case , which will be talked later .",
    "an exponent of 0.38 lager than 0.25 means that the correlation between segments quicken the broadening of the interface .    in the following we consider the formation of interface in a polydisperse a / b blend . in the process of the evolution of the volume fraction of @xmath147 species from its initially sharp distribution to the equilibrium diffusive distribution , the enhancement of @xmath72 above the equilibrium value on the a - rich side of the interface and a depletion on the a - poor side",

    "it is seen that only at very early time there is a power law between the interfacial width and time . in order to find this relation",
    "we also rescale the time variable . however , in the simulation we found that different forms of scaling of time were needed for different polydispersities .",
    "this is as expected since the extra characteristic lengths , the correlation lengths are different in blends with different polydispersities .",

    "<S> the correlation is approximately expressed by debye function and the diffusion dynamics are based on the rouse chain model . </S>",
    "<S> the chain length distribution is described by the continuous schulz distribution . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical calculation indicates that the broadening of interface with respect to time obeys a power law at early times , and the power law indexes are the same for both monodisperse and polydisperse blend . </S>",
    "<S> the power law index is larger than that in the local coupling model . </S>",
    "<S> however there is not a unified scaling form of the broadening of the interface width if only the interfacial width at equilibrium is taken into account as the characteristic length of the system , because the correlation makes an extra characteristic length in the system , and the polydispersity is related to this length . </S>"
