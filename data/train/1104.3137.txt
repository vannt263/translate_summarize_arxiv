    "as is well known , there are two regimes where the qcd dynamics of the current correlators is well understood .",
    "the first one corresponds to the high energies where the asymptotic freedom allows to use the perturbative approach in terms of the strong coupling constant @xmath12 and where the asymptotics of the correlators for large euclidean momenta is governed by operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "the second well understood region is that of low external momenta where the dynamics is constrained by the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry . as a consequence ,",
    "the dominant contributions to the correlators and related amplitudes of the processes under interest come from the octet of the lightest pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 )  which are the corresponding ( pseudo)goldstone bosons ( gb ) .",
    "the correlators can be studied here by means of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite , which is the effective lagrangian field theory for this region , in terms of systematic simultaneous expansion in powers ( and logs ) of the momenta and quark masses .",
    "the applicability of chpt extends up to the hadronic scale @xmath16 which corresponds to the onset of non - goldstone resonances and where the chpt expansion fails to converge .",
    "ope and chpt provides us with asymptotic behaviour of the correlators in different regimes , however , both these approaches need further non - perturbative long - distance piece of information which is not known from the first principles , namely the values of the vacuum condensates for ope and the values of the effective low - energy constants ( lecs ) for chpt . in the latter case",
    "the lecs parameterize our lack of detailed information on the non - perturbative dynamics of the degrees of freedom above the hadronic scale @xmath17 and are connected with the order parameters of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the predictivity of chpt heavily relies on their determination . at the order @xmath18 , which corresponds to the recent accuracy of the nnlo chpt calculation ( for a comprehensive review and further references",
    "see @xcite ) , 90 + 4 lecs in the even intrinsic parity sector @xcite and 23 lecs in the odd sector variant of chpt . in the @xmath19 case",
    "we get 53 + 4 lecs in the intrinsic parity even sector and 5(13 ) lecs in the odd sector . ]",
    "@xcite appear in the effective lagrangian .",
    "though only special linear combinations of them are relevant for particular physical amplitudes , the uncertainty in their estimation is usually the weakest point of the interconnection between the theory and experiment .",
    "dispersion representation of those correlators which are order parameters of the chiral symmetry breaking ( and therefore do not get any genuine perturbative contribution ) enables to make use of information on the asymptotics both in the low and high energy regions and to relate the unknown lecs to the properties of the corresponding spectral functions in terms of the chiral sum rules gasser:1983yg , donoghue:1993xb , davier:1998dz , moussallam:1994xp , knecht:2001xc .",
    "these are usually assumed to be saturated by the low - lying resonant states ; such an assumption ( known as resonance saturation hypothesis ) connects the lecs to the phenomenology of resonances in the intermediate energy region @xmath20 .",
    "though the inclusion of only finite number of resonances has been questioned in the literature @xcite , it proved to be consistent in the @xmath21 case with other phenomenological determinations of lecs .",
    "the necessary ingredient of the resonance saturation approach to the determination / estimation of lecs is the phenomenological information on the physics of the lowest resonances .",
    "it can be conveniently parameterized by means of suitable phenomenological lagrangian . along with the chiral symmetry the guiding theoretical principles for its construction are those based on the large @xmath22 expansion of qcd @xcite . within the leading order in @xmath23 the correlators of the quark bilinears",
    "are given by an infinite sum of contributions of narrow meson resonance states the mass of which scales as @xmath24  and the interaction of which is suppressed by an appropriate power of @xmath25 .",
    "such a large @xmath22  representation of the correlators can be reconstructed using effective lagrangian @xmath26 including gb and infinite tower of resonance fields with couplings of the order @xmath27 according to the number @xmath28 of the resonance fields in the interaction vertices .",
    "the @xmath29 expansion is equivalent to the quasi - classical expansion , thus at the leading order only the tree graphs contribute and each additional loop is suppressed by one power of @xmath23 .    though @xmath26 is not known from the first principles , the information on the large @xmath22 hierarchy of the individual operators together with general symmetry assumptions allows one to construct all the relevant terms necessary to determine the lecs in the leading order of the large @xmath22 expansion up to given chiral order .",
    "the large @xmath22 approximation of lecs can be then formally achieved by means of the integrating out the resonance fields from the lagrangian @xmath30 .",
    "formally one gets lecs expressed in terms of the ( from the first principles unknown ) masses and couplings of the infinite tower of resonances .",
    "the large @xmath22  inspired phenomenological lagrangian suitable for the resonance saturation program for lecs can be then obtained as an approximation to @xmath26 where only finite number of resonances is kept .",
    "such a truncation of @xmath26 seems to be legitimate at low energies where the contribution of the higher resonances is expected to be suppressed .",
    "however , the lack of effective cut - off scale which could play here a role analogous to @xmath17  for chpt prevents us to interpret the resonance phenomenological lagrangian as a well defined effective theory in the usual sense .",
    "it is rather a qcd inspired phenomenological model which should share as much common features with qcd as possible .",
    "the latter principle generally puts various constraints on its effective couplings .",
    "for instance , the finite number of resonances involved generally corrupts the asymptotic behaviour of the correlators required by perturbative qcd and ope . however , it is natural to expect that for the correlators which are order parameters of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking that the latter behaviour extends down to the region of applicability of the phenomenological lagrangian and thus it is desirable to ensure the correct asymptotics by means of adjusting its couplings .",
    "this is however not enough to fix all of them ( often it is even not possible to satisfy all the ope requirements at once by a finite set of resonances ) therefore further phenomenological input is needed .",
    "at the leading order in @xmath23 , the above strategy for determination of lecs is essentially equivalent to the similar approach known as minimal hadronic ansatz ( mha)@xcite . within this approach",
    "the correlators are approximated by meromorphic function with correct pole structure corresponding to the resonance poles and the free parameters are fixed both by ope constraints and experimental inputs",
    ". only minimal number of resonances is taken into account , just those necessary to satisfy all the relevant ope ( when only the lowest resonances in each channel are included , the method is called lowest meson dominance ( lmd ) ansatz peris:2000tw , knecht:2001xc , but in this case not all ope constraints are guaranteed to be met @xcite ) . matching this ansatz to",
    "the low energy chpt expansion enables to determine relevant linear combinations of lecs .",
    "the method based on the resonance lagrangian is however little bit more general than mha or lmd . on one hand",
    "it enables to determine ( at least in principle ) the individual lecs , not only their linear combinations connected with particular correlators , on the other hand it provides a natural framework for going beyond the leading order in @xmath23 by means of integrating out the resonances at one loop level rosell:2005ai , rosell:2006dt , pich:2008jm , rosell:2009yb , pich:2010sm which also takes correctly into account the renormalization scale dependence of the lecs .",
    "the above principles of construction of phenomenological lagrangian with resonances are known since 1989 when the seminal paper @xcite on what is now known as resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath31 t ) was published . in this paper",
    "the resonance saturation of the @xmath32 lecs has been studied systematically while the @xmath33 lecs of the even intrinsic parity sector of chpt has been systematically analyzed 17 years later in cirigliano:2006hb .",
    "for a recent review and further references see portoles:2010yt .",
    "the study of the odd intrinsic parity sector of r@xmath31 t with vector resonances and corresponding saturation of the lecs for the @xmath33 anomaly sector of chpt started in @xcite and prades:1993ys , knecht:2001xc , ruizfemenia:2003hm , where also axial vector resonances has been included and where the particular operator basis of the r@xmath31 t lagrangian contributing to the correlators under interest has been constructed .",
    "the influence of pseudoscalar resonances on the odd intrinsic parity lecs has been studied in @xcite and corresponding part of r@xmath31 t lagrangian has been constructed in ananthanarayan:2002kj ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we resume this effort and construct the most general odd intrinsic parity sector of the r@xmath31 t lagrangian including the lowest multiplets of the vector @xmath34 , axial - vector @xmath35 , scalar @xmath36 and pseudoscalar @xmath37 resonances . in the @xmath38 channel",
    "we introduce thus beside the gb also the lowest non - gb resonance multiplet and therefore we go beyond the lmd approximation ( our correlators then correspond to what is called in @xcite as lmd+p ansatz ) .",
    "the resulting lagrangian is then used for the lowest resonance saturation of the @xmath33 anomaly sector of chpt .",
    "we also illustrate the general strategy of matching the correlators with ope on the concrete example of @xmath39 and @xmath40 three point functions and discuss related phenomenological applications .",

    "5 we give the result of the resonance saturation of the odd intrinsic parity @xmath33 lecs .",
    "a brief summary is given in sec 6 .",
    "the large @xmath0 counting of the relevant operators is discussed in appendix a and the operator redefinitions and reduction of the lagrangian is studied in appendix b.",
    "in what follows we will work in the chiral limit . the standard basic building block which includes",

    "we use here the antisymmetric tensor field for description of the spin-1 resonances .",
    "the reason is that though it is in principle equivalent to the proca field formalism ( see @xcite and @xcite for the general discussion of the equivalence at the order @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively and @xcite for particular discussion of the one - loop equivalence ) , the antisymmetric tensor field naturally couples to the lowest order @xmath68 chiral building blocks without derivatives and therefore it does not require additional contact terms necessary to compensate the wrong high energy behaviour of amplitudes and form factors under interest .",
    "moreover , when using the proca field without such contact terms it is not possible to saturate the @xmath69 lecs in the even intrinsic parity sector and for the similar reason also the lecs in the @xmath33 odd intrinsic parity sector .",
    "according to the large @xmath22 counting of interaction vertices with resonances we can organize the lagrangian @xmath70 of r@xmath31 t as an expansion in the number of resonance fields , @xmath71here @xmath72 contains only goldstone bosons and external sources and includes terms with the same structure as the usual @xmath73 chpt lagrangian , but the coupling constants are generally different .",

    "this implies the usual @xmath22 counting of the physical amplitudes with @xmath272 glueballs and @xmath273 mesons @xmath274this counting should be reflected within the construction of the effective chiral lagrangian of r@xmath31 t .",
    "according to the ( [ nc_couts ] ) , the explicit resonance fields have to be counted as @xmath275 .",
    "as far as the gb are concerned , within the tilded building blocs , each member of the pseudoscalar nonet is automatically accompanied with ( minus)one power of the decay constant @xmath276 , which ensures the right counting of the vertices with gb , provided the corresponding fields are counted as @xmath24 .",
    "the only subtlety is connected with the field @xmath259 .",
    "the origin of the field @xmath259 in the individual terms of the lagrangian is twofold .",
    "it can either come from the tilded building blocks @xmath277 , @xmath278 , @xmath279 ( and from their covariant derivatives @xmath280 ; note that it completely decouples from @xmath281 and @xmath282 ) or from the @xmath283dependence of the lagrangian .",
    "each operator @xmath284 constructed form the tilded building blocks only ( and therefore including at least one flavour trace , the only exception is @xmath285 ) is in general accompanied by a potential @xmath286 which is a function of the variable @xmath287 only , @xmath288while @xmath259 originating from the tilded operators is counted as @xmath289 as the other gb , however , the same field coming from the power expansion of the potentials counts as @xmath290 within the large @xmath22 expansion .",
    "therefore , expanding the general operator @xmath291 and the corresponding potential @xmath292 in powers of @xmath259 and its derivatives ( and taking into account that @xmath276 ) we have the following natural rule for the order @xmath293 of the resulting coupling constant at a term of this expansion with @xmath294  flavour traces , @xmath63 resonance fields and @xmath295 fields @xmath296 @xmath297the lower or higher bounds are saturated in the case when all @xmath259 s come exclusively either from @xmath292 or from @xmath298 .",
    "suppose that we had used the lo gb  equations of motion prior to the expansion in powers of @xmath259 .",
    "this allows to eliminate the terms with derivatives , namely @xcite @xmath299such a transformation of the original tilded operator do not create any extra trace in contrast to the octet case . because the singlet mass @xmath300 , the @xmath259 dependence of the resulting operator brings about a factor of the order @xmath301 ( the same , as if @xmath302 came from the potential ) and the above bounds on @xmath28 remain therefore valid . on the other hand ,",
    "the further simplification using the cayley - hamilton identity can destroy them , provided we use it in order to eliminate terms with less traces in favour of the terms with more traces .",
    "the next step is to integrate out @xmath259 treating the mass @xmath303 as @xmath105 .",
    "this can be done using its equation of motion , derived from the corresponding part of the lo lagrangian expanded in powers of @xmath259@xmath304where @xmath305 term comes from the expansion of the potential and is therefore of the order @xmath306 .",

    "the orders of the multiple trace operators within the @xmath257 operator basis are enhanced .",

    "more conveniently this can be expressed in terms of the actual number of traces @xmath315 and resonances @xmath316 as@xmath317the loophole of this formula is , that for its application one has to trace back which of the factors @xmath314 and @xmath318 originate in the @xmath259 dependence of the tilded lagrangian .",
    "the extreme cases are either none or all of them , which gives a much raw estimate@xmath319where now @xmath320 and @xmath321 are the total numbers of @xmath314 and @xmath318 traces in the operator , the lower bound corresponds now to the usual trace and resonance counting .",
    "let us illustrate the above statements by means of an explicit examples .",
    "for instance , the coupling at the term @xmath322 , at first sight of the order @xmath275 might be of the order @xmath95 or even @xmath323 , because it can originate either from the term@xmath324which has the constant @xmath325 , ( this corresponds to the lower bound ( [ bound1 ] ) ) or from the term@xmath326where @xmath327 ; ( this corresponds to the upper bound ( [ bound1 ] ) ) .",

    "the reason is that the lo contribution to @xmath369 that comes from the tree level and originates in the kinetic term of the field @xmath259@xmath370so that the loop contribution is suppressed by @xmath23 as usual .",

    "according to our rules the operators are of the order @xmath347 , @xmath24 and @xmath95 respectively ( as the similar operators without additional trace ) and all of them contribute therefore at the @xmath374 order of the lecs of the effective chiral lagrangian staying at the operators@xmath375however , these operators can be derived analogously as above from@xmath376by the process which saturates the upper bound of ( [ bound1 ] ) and results in the order @xmath358 .",
