    "the main obstacle to precise determinations of the parameters of the standard model is the difficulty in calculating hadronic matrix elements of weak operators . the wide range in allowed values for hadronic quantities such as @xmath0 ( the pseudoscalar decay constant of the @xmath5 meson ) , the form - factors for semi - leptonic @xmath5 decay , and @xmath4 ( describing mixing in the @xmath6-@xmath7 systems ) results in large uncertainties in our determinations of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa angles and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "lattice gauge theory , at least in principle , should allow us to compute such matrix elements from first principles , with control on all sources of systematic error .",
    "here , i review the current status of this effort .    the talk is organized as follows .",
    "i first discuss @xmath0 , both in the static approximation @xcite and with propagating quarks . in the case of @xmath9 ,",
    "the results show a wide spread , both among various groups working on the problem , and as a function of the lattice spacing @xmath10 .",
    "i explain the reasons for the spread and show that the @xmath10-dependence seems to be understandable in perturbation theory .",
    "the variation among groups is likely due to the poor signal - to - noise properties of static - light propagators .",
    "this can introduce spurious dependences on the details of how the signal is extracted .",
    "i discuss in particular the quality of the data obtained with different types of `` smearing . '' in the case of @xmath0  with propagating quarks , the results ( at least the raw data ) from different groups seem rather better in agreement .",
    "the main issues which i consider are the proper normalization of quarks with @xmath11 , the consistency between wilson quarks and sheikholeslami - wohlert ( sw ) improved quarks , and the consistency between the propagating and static decay constants .",
    "recent results for the form factors for semi - leptonic decays of @xmath2 mesons are then discussed @xcite .",
    "i focus on the normalization factors for the local and point - split currents and describe how their mass dependence may be understood , at least qualitatively .",
    "this provides a way to reconcile ( or at least reduce the discrepancies between ) results from different currents with different heavy quark masses .",
    "i then describe results presented at this conference for the form factors of the rare decay @xmath3 .",
    "this is a promising new way for the lattice to provide a handle on the standard model .",
    "the results suggest that rather stringent constraints on the standard model could be obtained with modest improvements in the lattice calculations and/or the experiment .",
    "finally i review some exciting new developments in the computation of @xmath4 on the lattice .",
    "all systematic errors but one appear to be under control , and that one is a chiral loop effect which should be no larger than a few percent .",
    "the result , @xmath12 or @xmath13 @xcite , is an important contribution of lattice qcd to standard model phenomenology .",
    "table  [ tab : fbstat ] gives some results for @xmath9  from various groups .",
    "note that the values range from a high of @xmath14 mev to a low of @xmath15 mev .",
    "however , it is misleading to compare these final answers , because different groups use 1 ) different values for @xmath16 , the lattice renormalization constant for the static - light axial vector current , and 2 ) different methods to set the lattice scale , @xmath10 .",
    "since what is really being calculated is @xmath17 , the result for @xmath9  is particularly sensitive to the value used for @xmath10 .",
    ".results for @xmath9  from various groups [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     some groups ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) have compared with experiment their results for the vector meson decay constant , @xmath18 , as a function of @xmath19 ( the square of the pseudoscalar to vector meson mass ratio ) .",
    "such comparisons can be very misleading since it is known that wilson quarks get much too small a value for the @xmath20 splitting for heavy quarks .",
    "thus this is not a good way to test various large-@xmath21 normalizations of the vector current .    finally , the normalization factor @xmath22 , which is not included in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , is as as large as @xmath23 for their heaviest quark masses .",
    "thus the extrapolation of form factors to the @xmath5 mesons in that paper should be taken as qualitative only .",
    "the penguin decay @xmath24 @xcite provides an excellent test of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is a short - distance decay at the quark level ( the loop with a virtual @xmath25-quark dominates ) , so the inclusive rate can be calculated perturbatively . in the sm ,",
    "the branching ratio @xmath26 is a slowly varying function of the top quark mass and is essentially independent of the ckm angles in the 3-generation case .",
    "these features make it very sensitive to physics beyond the sm .",
    "the branching ratio for the exclusive decay @xmath3  has been measured experimentally to be @xmath27 @xcite . for theory to make contact with this result , the ratio @xmath28 is required .",
    "phenomenological evaluations of @xmath29 vary from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , so the lattice can help out greatly here .    in leading logarithmic order one only one needs to compute the form factors @xmath32 , defined by @xmath33 where the operator on the lhs arises from the short distance expansion of the penguin loop , @xmath34 is the photon momentum , and the definitions of the coefficients @xmath35 can be found for example in refs .",
    "the form factors obey @xmath36 , and @xmath37 does not contribute for a real photon , so @xmath29 is determined by @xmath38 .",
    "after a first look on the lattice @xcite , two evaluations of the form factors have been attempted recently @xcite .",
    "an extrapolation to the @xmath5 mass is required as usual .",
    "the two groups differ in how they perform the extrapolations .",
    "bhs @xcite check that pole dominance relates @xmath36 to @xmath39 , then extrapolate @xmath39 to the @xmath5 using the relation derived from heavy quark effective theory : @xmath40 and finally use pole dominance to get @xmath41 from @xmath39 at the @xmath5 .",
    "ukqcd @xcite calculate @xmath38 directly on the lattice ( with some mild interpolation ) and then extrapolate @xmath38 linearly in @xmath42 to the @xmath5 .",
    "each method has some disadvantages : bhs use pole dominance over a wider range ( @xmath43 ) than can be checked with the current lattice data ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "ukqcd do a `` blind '' ( without theoretical guidance ) extrapolation of @xmath38 to the @xmath5 mass .",
    "obviously i prefer the bhs approach , but both methods are plausible .",
    "the difference in the final results gives some measure of the systematics : bhs get @xmath45 ; ukqcd get @xmath46 ( assuming approximate independence of the spectator quark mass ) .",
    "using their result for @xmath38 , bhs find @xmath47 .",
    "combined with the experimental @xmath48 for @xmath3 , this produces a @xmath49 bound which is , unfortunately , uninteresting : @xmath50 gev . however , because @xmath51 is a slowly varying function of @xmath8 , it would not take much improvement in the lattice and/or experimental results to produce a rather stringent bound .",
    "in the past year , there has been considerable progress in the computation of @xmath4 , the @xmath52-@xmath53 mixing parameter .",
    "first of all , the calculations of the @xmath54 perturbative corrections to all relevant lattice operators have been completed @xcite .",
    "these include 4-quark operators of the following types : gauge - noninvariant ( landau gauge ) `` unsmeared '' ( @xmath55 ) @xcite and `` smeared '' ( @xmath56 ) @xcite , and gauge - invariant ( @xmath55 with links ) @xcite . without the perturbative corrections ,",
    "results for @xmath4 from different operators differ by as much as @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) at @xmath59 @xcite and as much as @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) at @xmath62 @xcite . with the perturbative corrections",
    "included , results with different operators agree within errors @xcite .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kek ] , taken from ref .  @xcite .",
    "note that with the bare lattice coupling the disagreement between different operators is reduced but not removed @xcite ; full agreement occurs when one uses an improved ( `` boosted '' ) coupling _  la _ lepage and mackenzie @xcite .",
    "( tadpole improvement is not used here because various operators involve different numbers of links . ) the results @xcite also agree between groups .",
    "the second advance involves the comparison of quenched and full qcd results for @xmath4 . at the level of the statistics ( @xmath63 ) ,",
    "no difference is found @xcite .",
    "the two dynamical quark masses in the full qcd simulations are degenerate and roughly equal to the average quark mass in the kaon ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "one can easily estimate , using the known chiral logarithms @xcite , how large a difference one would expect in the full theory between the simulated case and the physical situation with @xmath65 .",
    "the result is a difference of only 3% to 4% @xcite .",
    "this of course needs to be checked in simulations .",
    "unfortunately , the quenched theory can not be used to estimate the difference between a @xmath4 with degenerate quarks and one with a light @xmath66 .",
    "quenched chiral perturbation theory shows @xcite that the chiral logs for a @xmath4 with non - degenerate quarks ( in contrast to the degenerate case ) are different in the quenched and full theories .",
    "the third advance is the understanding of the lattice spacing errors . at _",
    "lattice 91 _ , the @xmath4 data @xcite showed a strong dependence on @xmath10 , and it was unclear how to extrapolate to the continuum : a linear extrapolation in @xmath10 gave @xmath67 ; a quadratic , @xmath68 .",
    "this difference dominated the systematic errors .",
    "sharpe @xcite has now shown that the lattice spacing errors are @xmath69 .",
    "the basic idea is simple : the staggered fermion action has corrections only at @xmath69 .",
    "so corrections of @xmath70 to @xmath4 could come only from the dimension-6 weak operators themselves , through mixing with dimension-7 operators .",
    "however , a detailed enumeration shows that no such operators exist with all the right symmetries : hypercubic group , flavor symmetry , and individual axial rotations of each flavor .",
    "once one knows the lattice spacing errors are @xmath69 , it is straightforward to include the perturbative corrections and extrapolate existing data of gupta , kilcup and sharpe @xcite to the continuum .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath71 where the continuum @xmath72 with @xmath73mev is used to obtain the second equation .",
    "the only errors not included above are those due to quenching and to the use of degenerate quarks .",
    "as discussed above , the quenched and full theories agree for degenerate quarks at a scale roughly that of the quenched @xmath59 ( @xmath74gev ) .",
    "one needs however to check that the theories continue to agree at smaller lattice spacings .",
    "in addition , the effects of non - degenerate quarks in the full theory need to be studied .",
    "however , given the size of the chiral logs , i would be surprised if this amounted to more than a 5% or 6% error . thus if one at most doubles the systematic errors in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bk]),(23 ) , one has a result which is likely to be very reliable .",
    "this is a major accomplishment of lattice qcd .",
    "i d like to briefly mention one other result which has implications for light - light weak matrix elements .",
    "kuramashi and collaborators @xcite have obtained results for @xmath75-@xmath75 scattering in qcd .",
    "their method makes possible the first calculation of the @xmath76 scattering length .",
    "the same method may ultimately allow the computation of the @xmath77 @xmath78 weak amplitude , a computation which has bedeviled some of us in lattice gauge theory over the past ten years .",
    "the basic results have already been summarized in the introduction .",
    "i would just like to add the observation that we owe a great debt to lepage and mackenzie for showing how to understand and control lattice perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this has made possible many of the advances discussed above .",
