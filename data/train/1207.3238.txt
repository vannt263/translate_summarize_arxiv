    "one of the most common smoothing methods is moving average .",
    "this method is a technique that can be applied for the time series analysis , either to produce smoothed periodogram of data , or to make better estimation and forecasts @xcite .    a moving average ( ma ) method is the unweighted mean of the previous @xmath69 datum points .",
    "suppose individual observations , @xmath70 are collected .",
    "the moving average of width @xmath71 at time @xmath72 is defined by montgomery @xcite @xmath73 for periods @xmath74 , we do not have @xmath71 observations to calculate a moving average of width @xmath71 .",
    "now , we develop the construction of the moving average method . for this aim , we defined the moving average of width @xmath71 at time @xmath72 as : @xmath75 from equation ( [ rev ] )",
    ", the moving average statistic is the average of the @xmath71 most recent observations .",
    "however , for @xmath76 , the moving average at time @xmath72 is defined as the average of all observations that are equal or greater than @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath78    one characteristic of the ma is that if the data have an uneven path , applying the ma will eliminate abrupt variation and cause the smooth path .",
    "in the next subsection , this characteristic of the ma method is used and a new entropy estimator is presented .      in this subsection , we use the ma method and obtain an entropy estimator which provides a new test statistic that achieves higher power than the previous test statistics against the alternatives with monotone increasing hazard functions . according to the subsection 2.1 , we know that @xmath79 and the approximated of it , is defined in ( [ dec ] ) .",
    "@xmath80 as a function of quantiles in ( [ dec ] ) is the sample path of order statistics , but usually it is not smooth .",
    "so we propose to imply the ma method of proper order , say @xmath81 , to smooth this sample path and define the new variables @xmath82 from the equation ( [ rev ] ) and ( [ rev2 ] ) as follows : @xmath83    by this method , we obtain an estimator for ( [ dec ] ) as : @xmath84 where the window size of @xmath15 is a positive integer , which is less than @xmath85 ; and @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and @xmath34 for @xmath35 also @xmath86 was introduced by yousefzadeh and arghami @xcite as : @xmath87 for @xmath88 is less than @xmath89 and for @xmath90 is more than @xmath91 .",
    "we can prove that the scale of the random variable @xmath2 has no effect on the accuracy of @xmath92 in estimating @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote entropies of the distribution of continuous random variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath93 for @xmath44 .",
    "so we have @xmath94 then the following properties hold    * @xmath95 * @xmath96 * @xmath97    where the superscript @xmath39 and @xmath40 refer to the corresponding distribution .    for the explanation of the proposed method , we simulate 30 samples from the exponential distribution with mean @xmath98 , consider their order statistics and censor 5 of them from the right , and plot the sample path of 25 points in figure @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "[ order ]    the sample path of order statistics is smoothed by ma of order @xmath100 .",
    "new variables are defined from ( [ y ] ) and the smoothed path of new variables is plotted in figure 1 with @xmath101 .",
    "this plot shows that the new sample path is smoother than the sample path of the original order statistics .",
    "also , with considering ma of order 5 , we define new variables from ( [ y ] ) and plot them in figure 1 with @xmath102 . even though the smoothing sample path of order statistics by using ma of order 3 is not as smooth as using ma of order 5 , the resulting powers , which are demonstrated in section @xmath103 , are the same up to two digits of decimals .",
    "so without loss of generality , we just consider ma of order @xmath104 in ( [ y ] ) .",

    "@xmath56    if @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then @xmath92 is a consistent estimator of @xmath57 .    *",

    "proof of this theorem is quite similar to the proof of theorem 2.1 .",
    "for a null distribution function @xmath110 the kl information for the type - ii censored data is defined to be : @xmath111 then the kl information can be approximated with @xmath112 thus the test statistic based on @xmath113 can be written as : @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 is an estimator of @xmath117 and @xmath36 and @xmath92 is defined in ( [ 2test ] ) and ( [ hbar ] ) , respectively .",
