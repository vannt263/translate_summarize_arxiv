    "the deviation from the maxwell distribution may be described by a sonine polynomials expansion @xcite .",
    "this expansion is applicable to the main part of the velocity distribution , excluding the high - energy tails , which is known to be exponentially overpopulated @xcite .",
    "so far it was silently accepted that the sonine expansion is a converging series while the exponential tail does not noticeably contribute to the coefficients of this expansion .",
    "this assumption was supported by direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) of the boltzmann equation @xcite , as well as by molecular dynamics simulations of granular gases @xcite . up to now , however , neither the region of validity of the sonine expansion is known , nor the impact of the exponential tail on the convergence of this series .",
    "huthmann , orza , and brito @xcite derived a system of equations for the sonine coefficients from the boltzmann equation and solved it perturbatively with the assumption that the sonine coefficient @xmath13 is of the order @xmath14 with @xmath15 being a small parameter .",
    "for @xmath16 they obtained rapid decrease of the sonine coefficients with escalating order @xmath17 , while for smaller values of @xmath6 the high - order coefficients , @xmath18 , were not negligible and could be of the same order as the first non - trivial coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "it was not evident , however , whether the sonine polynomials expansion breaks down for @xmath19 , or the perturbative approach based on the conjecture @xmath20 was inadequate .    in the present study",
    "we derive the third sonine coefficient , @xmath0 , and address the convergence of the sonine polynomials expansion analytically and numerically by means of dsmc .",
    "we show that the sonine coefficients do not decrease with increasing @xmath18 for @xmath19 , i.e. , the sonine series diverges .",
    "we conclude that the breakdown of the sonine expansion is caused by the increasing impact of the exponentially overpopulated tail for large dissipation .",
    "we consider a granular gas of particles of mass @xmath21 which interact with a constant coefficient of restitution @xmath6=const . and neglect their rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "we assume that the gas is in the homogeneous cooling state at number density @xmath22 . moreover , we assume that the velocity distribution function of the gas @xmath23 has acquired its scaling form @xcite , i.e. @xmath24 where@xmath25is the system dimension and @xmath26 is the thermal velocity due to the temperature @xmath27 , @xmath28 for @xmath29 the boltzmann equation reduces to two uncoupled equations , for the temperature and for the reduced distribution function @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the first equation reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the particle diameter . for @xmath33 ,",

    "the second equation for the reduced distribution function reads @xmath44    for the case of elastic collisions , @xmath45 , the resulting velocity distribution is the maxwell distribution .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently large coefficient of restitution , @xmath46 , we may assume that @xmath30 is close to the maxwellian , @xmath47 .",

    "the equations for the moments may be found multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "by @xmath54 , integrating over @xmath55 , and using the orthogonality of the sonine polynomials .",
    "this yields an infinite set of equations @xcite , @xmath56 since @xmath57 and @xmath58 are expressed in terms of the sonine coefficients , this set of equations can be used to determine the sonine coefficients and , thus , to find the velocity distribution . to close the set of equations , a cutoff of the series",
    "is applied , that is , it is assumed that the sonine coefficients @xmath13 with @xmath59 are negligible .",
    "the first sonine coefficient vanishes , @xmath60 , according to the definition of temperature @xcite . since @xmath61 , the first equation in eq . for @xmath62 gives the identity .",
    "the second equation in eq . for @xmath63 allows to find @xmath1 by expressing @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 in terms of @xmath1 and neglecting all other sonine coefficients @xmath0 , @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the first non - trivial sonine coefficient is @xmath1 .",
    "we write @xmath68 $ ] for the velocity distribution function by assuming that @xmath2 , @xmath69 are negligible .",
    "further , we write eq . for @xmath63 and @xmath70 and express all quantities in these two equations in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , @xmath71 to find the moments @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath72 we recast eq . using the properties of the collision integral ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the variation of some quantity @xmath75 in a direct collision .",

    "these coefficients are very small for @xmath19 , which indicates the convergence of the sonine expansion . for larger inelasticity ,",
    "however , the absolute values of @xmath97 , @xmath98 increase with increasing @xmath99 .",
    "hence we conclude that for large inelasticity , @xmath100 , the sonine expansion does not converge .",
    "a similar result was reported in @xcite , where the sonine coefficients were found from the boltzmann equation under the assumption @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "what is the reason for the breakdown of the sonine expansion with increasing inelasticity ?",
    "this happens due to the increasing impact of the overpopulated tail of the velocity distribution function @xcite , which reads for @xmath103 @xcite : @xmath104 where @xmath65 has been defined above , while the prefactor @xmath105 is unknown . for small @xmath6",
    "the exponential overpopulation starts for velocities that are not significantly larger than the thermal velocity . in this case",
    "the contribution to the moments @xmath106 from the exponential tail rapidly grows with increasing @xmath17 , which entails the corresponding growth of @xmath13 and ultimately , the breakdown of the sonine expansion .",
    "simulations show that at least in some range of @xmath6 the main part of the distribution with @xmath107 has a crossover to the tail distribution , eq .",
    ", at @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "assuming that the overpopulation of the tail starts at @xmath109 @xcite one can analyze the contribution from the exponential tail to the moments @xmath110 .",
    "the breakdown of the sonine expansion may be also understood from a simple mathematical argument : the sonine expansion , eq .",
    ", contains only even powers of the scaled velocity @xmath111 .",
    "the tail of the distribution decaying as @xmath112 , @xmath113 , however , can not be represented by a series in even powers of @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , for any value of @xmath114 , the presence of the asymptotic exponential tail _ must _ invalidate the sonine expansion in the limit @xmath115 .",
    "for @xmath116 the tail starts at rather large velocity @xmath117 , thus , only high - order terms of the sonine expansion which are sensitive to large values of @xmath111 are affected and the corresponding high - order sonine coefficients @xmath97 are large . indeed , for @xmath118 , according to eq .",
    "@xmath119 while the sonine polynomials may be approximated by their leading - order terms : @xmath120 the distribution function itself , however , is extremely small for these velocities . for larger inelasticity ,",
    "that is , smaller @xmath6 , the value of @xmath121 is not significantly larger than the thermal velocity . in this case , as shown in the present paper , already smaller sonine coefficients such as @xmath0 to @xmath4 may diverge .",
    "nevertheless , the sonine expansion remains a valuable tool for describing the main part of the velocity distribution , @xmath30 , for @xmath122 which is the range of interest in most cases .",
    "when considering the expansion up to @xmath4 , the range @xmath123 seems to be a safe interval for applying the sonine expansion . for higher - order expansions , however , the range of validity may be restricted to a smaller interval .",
    "a more quantitative discussion will be given in @xcite",
    "we derived analytical expressions for the first two non - trivial sonine coefficients as functions of the coefficient of restitution , @xmath90 and @xmath124 , and show that the coefficient @xmath0 is not negligible as compared to @xmath1 as it was assumed in previous theories .",
    "we show that for small inelasticity , @xmath125 , @xmath13 with @xmath126 are significantly smaller than @xmath1 , @xmath0 and may be neglected , that is , the sonine expansion converges . for this interval of @xmath6",
    "the obtained theoretical values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are in a good agreement with numerical results .",
    "we also find numerically the coefficients @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 for a wide range of the restitution coefficient , @xmath127 . for large inelasticity , @xmath128 ,",
    "the high - order sonine coefficient are of the same order as @xmath1 , @xmath0 and , hence , may not be neglected .",
    "the reason for this behavior is the significant contribution of the exponentially overpopulated tail to the moments of the velocity distribution function .",
    "this contribution rapidly growths with increasing inelasticity and the order of the moments , ultimately undermining the sonine polynomial expansion ."
