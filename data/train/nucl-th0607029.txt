    "the properties of dense and/or highly asymmetric nuclear matter , where _ asymmetric _ may refer to isospin or spin asymmetries , are of great current interest in nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "this topic is broad - scoped since it reaches out to exotic systems on the nuclear chart as well as , on a dramatically different scale , exotic objects in the universe such as compact stars .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the bulk and single - particle properties of spin - polarized neutron matter .",
    "the study of the magnetic properties of dense matter is of considerable interest in conjunction with the physics of pulsars , which are believed to be rapidly rotating neutron stars with strong surface magnetic fields .",
    "the polarizability of nuclear matter can have strong effects on neutrino diffusion and , in turn , variations of the neutrino mean free path due to changes in the magnetic susceptibility of neutron matter can impact the physics of supernovae and proton - neutron stars .",
    "the magnetic properties of neutron / nuclear matter have been studied extensively since a long time by many authors and with a variety of theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , conclusions about the possibility of a phase transition to a ferromagnetic state at some critical density are still contradictory .",
    "for instance , calculations based on skyrme - type interactions @xcite predict that such instabilities will occur with increasing density .",
    "in particular , currently used skyrme forces show a ferromagnetic transition for neutron matter at densities between 1.1@xmath0 and 3.5@xmath0 @xcite . on the other hand , more recent predictions based on monte carlo simulations @xcite and the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approach with realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions @xcite exclude these instabilities , at least at densities up to several times normal nuclear density .",
    "similarly , no evidence of a transition to a ferromagnetic state was found in older calculations based on the brueckner - hartree - fock approach with the reid hard - core potential as well as a non - local separable potentials @xcite .",
    "relativistic calculations based on effective meson - nucleon lagrangians @xcite predict the ferromagnetic transition to take place at several times nuclear matter density , with its onset being crucially determined by the inclusion of the isovector mesons .",
    "clearly , the existence of such phase transition depends sensitively on the modeling of the spin - dependent part of the nuclear force and its behavior in the medium .",
    "thus , this unsettled issue goes to the very core of nuclear physics .",
    "our calculation is microscopic and treats the nucleons relativistically .",
    "a parameter - free and internally consistent approach is important if we are to interpret our conclusions in terms of the underlying nuclear force .",
    "this is precisely our focus , namely to understand the in - medium behavior of specific components of the nuclear force ( in this case , the spin dependence ) .",
    "different nn potentials can have comparable quality as seen from their global description of nn data and yet differ in specific features .",
    "thus , it will be interesting to explore how , for a given many - body approach , predictions for spin - polarized neutron matter depend upon specific features of the nn potential .",
    "second , it will be insightful to compare with predictions based on a realistic nn potential and the bhf method @xcite , especially at the higher densities , where the repulsive dirac effect can have a dramatic impact on the short - range nature of the force .",
    "this work is organized in the following way : after the introductory notes in this section , we briefly review our theoretical framework ( section 2 ) ; our results are presented and discussed in section 3 ; we conclude in section 4 with a short summary and outlook .",
    "the starting point of any microscopic calculation of nuclear structure or reactions is a realistic free - space nn interaction .",
    "a realistic and quantitative model for the nuclear force with reasonable theoretical foundations is the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise specified , our standard framework consists of the bonn b potential together with the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach to nuclear matter . a detailed description of our application of the dbhf method to nuclear , neutron , and asymmetric matter can be found in our earlier works @xcite .",
    "similarly to what we have done to describe isospin asymmetries of nuclear matter , the single - particle potential is the solution of a set of coupled equations @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 refer to `` up '' and `` down '' polarizations , respectively , and where each @xmath5 term contains the appropriate ( spin - dependent ) part of the interaction , @xmath6 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath7 where the second summation indicates integration over the two fermi seas of spin - up and spin - down neutrons , and    @xmath8    the notation @xmath9 is used for the clebsh - gordon coefficients .",
    "clearly , the need to separate the interaction by individual spin components brings along angular dependence , with the result that the single - particle potential depends also on the direction of the momentum .",
    "notice that the @xmath10-matrix equation is solved using partial wave decomposition and the matrix elements are then summed as in eq .",
    "( 4 ) to provide the new matrix elements in the uncoupled - spin representation needed for eq .  ( 3 ) . the three - dimensional integration in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is performed in terms of the spherical coordinates of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , with the final result depending upon both magnitude and direction of @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "the scattering equation is solved using relative and center - of - mass coordinates , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these are easily related to the momenta of the two particles in the nuclear matter rest frame through the standard definitions @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "( the latter displays the dependence of the argument of the spherical harmonics upon @xmath13 and @xmath11 . )",
    "solving the @xmath10-matrix equation requires knowledge of the single - particle potential , which in turn requires knowledge of the interaction .",
    "hence , eqs .",
    "( 1 - 2 ) together with the @xmath10-matrix equation constitute a self - consistency problem , which is handled , technically , exactly the same way as previously done for the case of isospin asymmetry @xcite . the pauli operator for scattering of two particles with unequal fermi momenta , contained in the kernel of the @xmath10-matrix equation , is also defined in perfect analogy with the isospin - asymmetric one @xcite , @xmath18 notice that , although a full three - dimensional integration is performed in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the usual angle - average procedure is applied to the pauli operator ( when expressed in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and to the two - particle propagator in the kernel of the @xmath10-matrix equation .",
    "once a self - consistent solution is obtained for the single - particle spectrum , the average potential energy for particles with spin polarization @xmath19 is obtained as @xmath20 the average potential energy per particle is then @xmath21    the kinetic energy ( or , rather , the free - particle operator in the dirac equation when using the dbhf framework ) , is also averaged over magnitude and direction of the momentum . in particular , we calculate the average free - particle energy for spin - up(down ) neutrons as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the average over the magnitude of the momentum .",
    "notice that the angular dependence comes in through the effective masses , which , being part of the parametrization of the single - particle potential , are themselves direction dependent ( and of course different for spin - up or spin - down neutrons ) .",
    "finally @xmath24 and the average energy per neutron is @xmath25    as in the case of isospin asymmetry , it can be expected that the dependence of the average energy per particle upon the degree of polarization @xcite will follow the law @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spin asymmetry , defined by @xmath28 .",
    "a negative value of @xmath29 would signify that a polarized system is more stable than unpolarized neutron matter .    from the energy shift , @xmath30 the magnetic susceptibility can be easily calculated . if the parabolic dependence is assumed",
    ", then one can write the magnetic susceptibility as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the neutron magnetic moment .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility in often expressed in units of @xmath33 , the magnetic susceptibility of a free fermi gas , @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the average fermi momentum which is related to the total density by @xmath36 the fermi momenta for up and down neutrons are @xmath37    .",
    "the angle is defined relative to the polarization axis . ]                                 ( from lowest to highest curve ) .",
    "predictions obtained with our dbhf calculation . ]        .",
    "predictions are obtained with the dbhf model . ]    for the most general case , it will be necessary to combine isospin and spin asymmetry . with twice as many degrees of freedom , the coupled self - consistency problem schematically displayed in eqs.(1 - 2 ) is numerically more involved but straightforward .",
    "this is left to a future work .",
    "we begin by showing the angular and momentum dependence of the single - neutron potential , see figs .  1 - 2 .",
    "the angular dependence is rather mild , especially at the lowest momenta . as can be reasonably expected , it becomes stronger at larger values of the asymmetry , see fig .",
    "2 . in fig .  3",
    ", the asymmetry dependence is displayed for fixed density and momentum ( here the angular dependence is averaged out ) . as the density of @xmath3 particles goes up , the total density remaining constant , the most likely kind of interaction for @xmath3 neutrons is of the @xmath38 type .",
    "similarly , the largest contribution to the @xmath4-particle potential is of the @xmath39 type , see eqs .",
    "( 1 - 2 ) , with the latter being apparently more attractive , as can be inferred by the spin splitting of the potential shown in fig .",
    "before we move on to discuss this issue in greater details , we also show the effective masses of @xmath3 and @xmath4 neutrons , see fig .  4 , and observe that they display a qualitatively similar behavior as the one of the corresponding single - particle potentials .",
    "the average energy per particle at various densities and as a function of the asymmetry parameter is shown in the third frame of fig .",
    "the first two frames display the contribution from the average potential energy and the average kinetic energy , respectively . the parabolic dependence on @xmath27 , or linear on @xmath40 ,",
    "is obviously verified . in fig .",
    "6 we show the corresponding predictions obtained with the conventional brueckner - harteee - fock approach",
    ". this comparison may be quite insightful , as we further discuss next .",
    "we notice that the dirac energies are overall more repulsive , but the parabolas predicted with the bhf prescription appear to become steeper , relative to each other , as density grows .",
    "the energy difference between the totally polarized state and the unpolarized one for both the relativistic and the non - relativistic calculation is shown in fig .",
    "although initially higher , the growth of the dbhf curve shows a tendency to slow down and the two sets of predictions cross over just above 3@xmath0 .    before leaving this detour into the non - relativistic model ,",
    "we observe that the predictions shown in fig .  6 are reasonably consistent with those from previous studies which used the brueckner - hartree - fock approach and the nijmegen ii and reid93 nn potentials @xcite . in fact , comparison with that work allows us to make some useful observations concerning the choice of a particular nn potential , for a similar many - body approach ( in this case , bhf ) .",
    "we must keep in mind that off - shell differences exist among nn potentials ( even if nearly equivalent in their fit of nn scattering data ) and those will impact the @xmath10-matrix ( which , unlike the @xmath41-matrix , is not constrained by the two - body data ) .",
    "furthermore , off - shell differences will have a larger impact at high fermi momenta , where the higher momentum components of the nn potential , ( usually also the most model dependent ) , play a larger role in the calculation .",
    "accordingly , the best agreement between our bhf predictions and those of ref .",
    "@xcite is seen at low to moderate densities .",
    "furthermore , as far as differences based on the choice of the nn potential are concerned , we would expect them to be more pronounced for nuclear matter than for pure neutron matter , since the largest variations among modern realistic potentials are typically found in the strength of the tensor force , which is stronger in t=0 partial waves ( obviously absent in the @xmath42 system ) .",
    "this point will be explored in a later investigation .    in the remainder of this paper , we will focus on the dbhf model , which is our standard operational approach . to further explore the possibility of a ferromagnetic transition",
    ", we have extended the dbhf calculation to densities as high as 10@xmath0 .",
    "the same method as described in ref .",
    "@xcite is applied to obtain the energy per particle where a self - consistent solution can not be obtained ( see section iii of ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the ( angle - averaged ) neutron effective masses for both the unpolarized and the fully polarized case are shown in fig .",
    "8 as a function of density .",
    "dbhf predictions for the average energy per particle are shown in fig .  9 at densities ranging from @xmath43=0.5@xmath0 to 10@xmath0 .",
    "what we observe is best seen through the spin - symmetry energy , which we calculate from eq .",
    "( 12 ) and show in fig .",
    "we see that at high density the energy shift between polarized and unpolarized matter continues to grow , but at a smaller rate , and eventually appear to saturate .",
    "similar observations already made in conjunction with isospin asymmetry were explained in terms of stronger short - range repulsion in the dirac model @xcite . it must be kept in mind that some large contributions , such as the one from the @xmath44 state , are not allowed in the fully polarized case .",
    "now , if such contributions ( typically attractive at normal densities ) become more and more repulsive with density ( due to the increasing importance of short - range repulsive effects ) , their absence will amount to less repulsive energies at high density . on the other hand ,",
    "if large and attractive singlet partial waves remain attractive up to high densities , their suppression ( demanded in the totally polarized case ) will effectively amount to increased repulsion .    in conclusion , although the curvature of the spin - symmetry energy may suggest that ferromagnetic instabilities are in principle possible within the dirac model , inspection of fig .",
    "10 reveals that such transition does not take place at least up to 10@xmath0",
    ". clearly it would not be appropriate to explore even higher densities without additional considerations , such as transition to a quark phase .",
    "in fact , even on the high side of the densities considered here , softening of the equation of state from additional degrees of freedom not included in the present model may be necessary in order to draw a more definite conclusion .    finally , in fig .",
    "11 we show the ratio @xmath45 , whose behavior is directly related to the spin - symmetry energy , see eq .",
    "( 13 ) . clearly",
    ", similar observations apply to both fig .",
    "11 and fig .  10 .",
    "( the magnetic susceptibility would show an infinite discontinuity , corresponding to a sign change of @xmath29 , in case of a ferromagnetic instability . )",
    "we have calculated bulk and single - particle properties of spin - polarized neutron matter .",
    "the eoss we obtain with the dbhf model are generally rather repulsive at the larger densities .",
    "the energy of the unpolarized system ( where all @xmath42 partial waves are allowed ) , grows rapidly at high density with the result that the energy difference between totally polarized and unpolarized neutron matter tends to slow down with density .",
    "this may be interpreted as a _ precursor _ of spin - separation instabilities , although no such transition is actually seen up to 10@xmath0 .",
    "our analysis allowed us to locate the origin of this behavior in the contributions to the energy from specific partial waves and their behavior in the medium , particularly increased repulsion in the singlet states .    in future work",
    ", the impact of further extensions will be considered , such as : examining the effects of contributions that soften the eos ( especially at high density ) ; extending our framework to incorporate both spin- and isospin - asymmetries ; examining the temperature dependence of our observations for spin- and isospin - asymmetries of neutron and nuclear matter .",
