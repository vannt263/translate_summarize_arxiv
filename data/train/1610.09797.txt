    "in classical systems in equilibrium states , when temperature increases , the system can undergo from ordered to disordered structures due to the competition between interactions between constituents and ( configurational ) entropy .",
    "when we prepare set of complete orthonormal basis @xmath0 to describe microscopic structures on configuration space under fixed composition @xmath1 , their expectation value at temperature @xmath2 can be typically obtained through canonical average , @xmath3 , where summation is taken over all microscopic states at composition @xmath1 on phase space .",
    "since number of possible microscopic states astronomically increases , potential energy surface should be described by corresponding high - dimentional configuration space .",
    "therefore , a variety of calculation techniques have been developed to overcome the practical difficulty , including monte carlo ( mc ) simulation with metropolis algorism , multicanonical ensembles and entropic sampling to effectively sampling possible microscopic states for predicting macroscopic properties .",
    "although the developed approaches have successfully provided accurate prediction of disordered structures in equilibrium states , the role of spatial constraints on composition and temperature dependence of the disordered structures does not get sufficient attentin so far .",
    "very recently , we we develop a theoretical approach , enabling to provide new insight into how equilibrium properties ( including structures and free energy ) connects with spatial constraint on the system.@xcite through this approach , we find a few special microscopic states , called `` grand projection states '' ( gp states ) , that can be constructed without any information about energy or temperature , can characterize the macroscopic properties . in the present study",
    ", we extend the approach to investigating composition dependence of disordered structures in equilibrium states near equiatomic composition ( i.e. , which we call `` compositional asymmetry '' ) . through the extention",
    ", we provide analytical representation for temperature and composition dependence of disordered structure in terms of the condition of spatial constraint , which can be determined by energy of gp states .",
    "let us here consider a binary system ( for simplicity ) , but our derivation can be straightforwardly extended to multicomponent system as seen below . in classical system under potential energy as a function of spatial positions of constituents , we have found that grand - canonical average of structure can be universally given by@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively denotes taking average and standard deviation over all microscopic states on configuration space ( including compositions ) without weight of boltzmann factor @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively defined as @xmath10 and @xmath11 where summation is taken over possible configurational degree of freedom including composition , @xmath12 denotes partial average over microscopic states satisfying @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 represents inner product on configuration space . here ,",
    "we call @xmath18 as grand projection ( gp ) energy along @xmath19 , and corresponding special microscopic structure given by @xmath20 is called as gp state along @xmath19 , which is clearly independent of temperature and energy , and depends only on the class of spatial constraint since @xmath21 can be obtained by density of microscopic states on configuration space for _ non - interacting _ system .",
    "when we choose coordination @xmath19 as composition , corresponding energy and microscopic states are simply called as gp energy and gp state , which can provide relationship between chemical potential @xmath22 and grand - canonical average of composition , @xmath23 .    in the present study ,",
    "we only focus on the gp energy and state for composition , and we do not derive explicit expression for grand canonical average of structures : the reason is treating numerator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gps ] ) .",
    "when we directly apply the previous expression for two dimensional configuration space of @xmath24 in analogy to our previous approach using characteristics of multidimensional gaussian ( here , @xmath25 denotes density of microscopic states , and @xmath19 corresponds to pair correlations ) , we can obtain for numerator as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes covariance for @xmath24 .",
    "since for even - order correlation should be symmetric at equiatomic composition , we obtain @xmath28 , which should be only allowed at high temperature limit @xmath29 . therefore , in order to apply eq .",
    "( [ eq : gps ] ) at non - infinite temperature , we should take other stragegies . to include the asymmetry of @xmath24 , in analogy to obtaining gp states ,",
    "we should explicitly take composition - dependent partial average of @xmath1 in @xmath24 space .",
    "let @xmath30 be a function of composition @xmath1 . from the constraint condition that @xmath31 at @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a quadratic function of @xmath1 at",
    "@xmath34,@xcite we can determine the composition - dependence , namely , @xmath35 .",
    "here , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) denotes partial average @xmath38 for @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) . in order to obtain composition dependence of disordered structure from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gps ] ) , we should further determine the relationship between chemical potential @xmath22 and grand - canonical average of composition @xmath1 .",
    "this can be easily performed by choosing coordination of @xmath19 in eq .",

    "@xmath41 denotes absolute difference in grand projection energy along composition for @xmath42 and @xmath43 . ]",
    "using the above results , we can give analytical expression for pair correlation near equiatomic composition :    @xmath44    where @xmath45    here , superscript @xmath46 denotes disorderd structure for higher @xmath1 phase ( @xmath47 ) or for lower @xmath1 phase ( @xmath48 ) , where their coexistence can be determined from gp energy along @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath49.@xcite    from the above equations , we can clearly see that composition dependence of disordered structures can be characterized by five special microscopic states ( whose energy corresponds to @xmath18 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , whose structure can be known _ a priori _ when spatial constraint on the constituents is given . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : qgc ] ) , we can also see that compositional asymmetry around equiatomic composition is dominated by the asymmetry of gp energy along composition , where such asymmetry can be reasonably vanished at high temperature limit of @xmath34 .",
    "this can be schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asym ] , which shows the temperature and composition dependence of difference in structure , @xmath51 , for the case of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath41 denotes absolute difference in grand projection energy along composition for @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( energy is measured from @xmath50 ) .     as a function of temperature , predicted by the present theory and mc simulation",
    "@xmath54 is normalized by value of @xmath55 that can take maximum under the given spatial constraint , i.e. , fcc lattice in this case .",

    "[ fig : asym ] with those obtained by full thermodynamic simulation : we artificially prepare effective multibody interactions in terms of generalized ising model on fcc lattice with binary elements , which provides well - known ordered structure of `` 40 '' at the ground state with order - disordere transition temperature is around 150 k.@xcite we estimate difference in short - range order ( sro ) parameter @xmath54 for the system between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which is symmetric with respect to equiatomic composition of @xmath58 .",
    "temperture dependence of sro is quantitatively estimated by applying the multibody interactions to monte carlo ( mc ) statistical simulation under canonical ensemble , where the mc cell contains 2048 atoms ( i.e. , @xmath59 expantion of conventional fcc unit cell ) with 8000 mc step per site to take ensemble average .",
    "the predicted @xmath54 by the present theory and mc simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dq ] together with the multibody interaction used .",
    "we can clearly see that at high temperature above @xmath60 k , sro by the present theory exhibit excellent agreement with that by mc , while it shows deviation with decrease of temperature .",
    "this deviation can be reasonablly interpreted since our theory is based on the configurational density of states ( cdos ) for _ non - interacting _ system well - characterized by multidimensional gaussian , whose deviation from practical cdos should be naturally enhanced by boltzmann factor @xmath7 at low temperature with the foot of the cdos from its center of gravity where effect of spatial constraint on cdos , especially information about landscape of higher order moment ( typically , greater than two ) , plays significant role , which has already been confirmed by our previous studies .",
    "inclusion of information about higher - order moments of cdos into the proposed eq .",
    "( [ eq : qgc ] ) therefore should be our future study .",
    "by focusing on the role of spatial constraint on equilibrium properties , we propose analytical representation for compositional asymmetry of disordered structure in binary system , which is dominated by energy of two specially selected microscopic states whose structures can be known a priori without any information about energy or temperature .",
    "we demonstrate the validity of the proposed representation by predicting the short - range order tendency on fcc lattice , compared with full thermodynamic simulation based on generalized ising model : while deviation is enhanced with decrease of temperature , we find excellent agreement at high temperature region .",
