    "the strong optical interaction seen when nanoscale metal - dielectric structures interact with light promise several applications , including optical manipulation well below the diffraction limit , high - speed information processing and integration of si electronics with optics @xcite .",
    "the strong interaction is a result of the resonant absorption of electromagnetic radiation by plasmons , which are collective oscillations of large concentrations of nearly free electrons @xcite . for nanoscale metallic structures , surface plasmons are primarily responsible for this interaction .",
    "nanocomposites made from metal nanostructures embedded in or placed on dielectrics offer significant potential as materials showing enhanced or tunable light harnessing @xcite .",
    "for instance , schaadt and co - workers @xcite have shown that incorporation of au nanoparticles on the surface of a si photodiode results in enhanced photocurrent at specific wavelengths that were correlated to the surface plasmon resonance .",
    "however , the fabrication of practically useful devices that utilize plasmonics to achieve a desired optical and/or electronic response requires the careful design and fabrication of nanomaterials with well defined shape , size and metal - dielectric composition .",
    "recently , there has been tremendous activity in controlling the physical attributes of nanoscale metallic structures , such as the particle size and shape , through a variety of techniques , including ion irradiation @xcite , laser - assisted chemical vapor decomposition @xcite and laser - induced dewetting @xcite .",
    "however , the fabrication of metal - dielectric nanocomposites driven by a knowledge - based design of optical properties is very important towards realizing cost - effective means for manufacturing such novel materials .    in this work",
    "we focus on a theory - driven design and optimization of metal - dielectric nanocomposites that can show broadband optical absorption via plasmonic effects .",
    "the desire to achieve broadband plasmonic absorption comes from the various experimental results that show that nanoparticles and nanocomposite coatings on photovoltaic devices can give rise to a wavelength - dependent photocurrent enhancement that correlates to the plasmonic responses of the applied material @xcite . while consideration of the effects of electromagnetic scattering due to the absorbing - layer s microstructure leads to further optimization @xcite , optimizing the absorption of incident solar energy though judicious design of metal type , nanoparticle shape , its volume fraction , and the host dielectric @xcite is likely to be the first step to an improved device .",
    "recently , a homogenization procedure has been proposed using the tight lower bounds of the bergman - milton formulations to characterize the optical properties of ternary nanocomposites consisting of metallic nanoparticles embedded in various host dielectrics @xcite . using this model ,",
    "excellent agreement was found between the experimentally measured and theoretically estimated optical absorption for a variety of plasmonic systems , including binary alloys , mixtures and core - shell structures .",
    "based on this success , we have extended the mixing approach and applied it to the case of quaternary metal - sio@xmath0 nanocomposites , i.e. a system containing three different metals in sio@xmath0 , to predict the broadband spectral response .",
    "we showed that a judicious selection of metal type , their concentration and particle size can result in broadband plasmonic light absorption @xcite , a feature that could be very beneficial in applications that need to maximize the absorption of incident broadband solar radiation , such as in solar cells and photodetectors .    here",
    "we present calculations of the broadband optical properties of other useful dielectric material , including si@xmath9n@xmath10 and tio@xmath0 .",
    "si@xmath1n@xmath2 is used in conventional solar cell technology as an anti - reflective coating layer @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the optical properties of binary and quaternary nanocomposites ( nc ) made from different metals ( al , cu , ag , au ) in si@xmath1n@xmath2 and determined wavelength regimes of strong absorption . based on these results",
    "we have designed a broadband absorbing nanocomposite whose absorption spectra is optimized to match the shape of the 1.5 am incident solar radiation .",
    "our results show that a quaternary nc containing cu , ag and al in si@xmath1n@xmath2 shows extremely good broadband absorption spectra . in comparison ,",
    "similar broadband absorption in sio@xmath0 requires cu , ag and au nanoparticles .",
    "tio@xmath11 is an essential component in dye - sensitized solar cells @xcite and its photocatalytic properties have a variety of uses , including in paint , in self - cleaning glasses , and in multifunctional coatings @xcite .",
    "however , one of the outstanding challenges in tio@xmath0 is to enhance its absorption in the visible spectrum . towards this goal ,",
    "we have explored the plasmonic absorption of several different metals ( al , cu , ag , au ) in tio@xmath0 .",
    "our calculations show that strong absorption occurs in the range of 670 - 700 nm by cu , ag or au while al shows broad absorption from the uv into the visible till about 500 nm .",
    "the results of this work show that it is possible to design and optimize the optical behavior of metal - dielectric nanocomposites with desired optical response , including for applications in energy harvesting .",
    "the remainder of this paper is divided as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : homogenization - technique ] we discuss the basic ideas behind plasmonics and plasmonic absorption and present the homogenization scheme that permits a theoretical estimate of the optical absorption in multimetal - dielectric nanocomposites . in sec .",
    "[ sec : potential - applications ] we discuss potential applications resulting from ncs that show absorption in broadband and/or at specific wavelengths .",
    "we also discuss the computational optimization scheme based on the simulated annealing technique that permits the optimization of a nanocomposite .",
    "we conclude the paper with brief discussions in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the essential physics of the plasmonic properties of metals irradiated by electromagnetic radiation in the optical regime are captured by the drude - sommerfeld theory of metals , with corrections to the kinetics of the free electron fermi gas due to energetic contributions from bound electrons @xcite . when a collection of atoms are brought together forming a crystalline lattice",
    ", one must determine the energy states of the _ system _ of valence electrons as their motion is influenced by the lattice ions and mutual interaction . in practice , the wave functions of the valence electrons are not strongly concentrated about their original atomic position but spread wide through the metal with a distance comparable to the mean - free path of the electrons ( @xmath12 angstroms ) .",
    "hence , the valence electrons form a sea filling the various electronic states of the system as a whole @xcite .",
    "a plasma oscillation in a metal is a collection of longitudinal or transverse excitation of these free electrons .",
    "a plasmon refers to the quanta of such an oscillation which may be stimulated by an incident electromagnetic ( em ) wave .",
    "preferential coupling between an incident em wave and a particular plasmon mode can give rise to resonance phenomenon . at normal incidence , for em wavelengths corresponding to this resonance frequency",
    ", the momentum of the plasmon will be negligible because the momentum of the reflected photon is virtually zero .",
    "thus , excitation of the plasmon mode is localized at the surface of the medium . however , for certain angles , when requirements for energy and momentum conservation are met , a surface - plasmon polariton wave may be induced that propagates along the surface of the media .",
    "the existence of these self - sustaining collective excitations at metal surfaces was originally predicted by ritchie @xcite.for the case of metallic nanoparticles , surface plasmonic effects are the dominate mechanism dictating the interaction with em energy . when metallic nanoparticles are embedded in a host dielectric , the precise wavelength where em energy and plasmonic modes couple at metal - film interface is dictated by the dielectric coefficient for the individual phases .",
    "the essential physics of this charge oscillation for dilute systems of metal nanoparticles ( @xmath13 ) in a dielectric matrix is captured by the lower bound for the effective dielectric coefficient proposed by bruggeman @xcite and milton @xcite .",
    "we have taken the binary dielectric mixing rule from bruggeman and milton and extended its application to multi - metal nanocomposite systems via a homogenization technique @xcite .    in the limit of long electromagnetic wavelength relative to the system microstructure",
    ", the technique of homogenization , where two or more constituent phases are blended together in such a manner that the resulting composite material appears as a continuous material , is an important tool in characterising the desired macroscopic responses of engineered materials .",
    "a large amount of research is dedicated towards placing bounds on the maximum and minimum values of the macroscopic dielectric coefficient that composite materials may take when only limited information is provided on features of the constituent phases including : volume fraction , average spacing , and/or spatial distribution @xcite .",
    "such models have been used in geological applications and are useful in predicting the behavior of natural occurring composites such as reservoir rocks @xcite or ice @xcite , which may contain dilute concentrations of useful resources such as natural gas , water , or minerals",
    ". while many bounds are available in the literature , certain bounds are more useful towards narrowing down the range of predicted macroscopic behavior for a particular situation of interest @xcite .",
    "for example , the wiener bounds are the loosest , giving the maximum and minimum values of the effective dielectric function independent of the type of mixture in question . for systems that are isotropic and with uniformly distributed constituents , the hashin - shtrikman bounds , based on a variational formulation of the energy functional for the mixture , represents a tighter range of values than the weiner bounds at the expense of the added assumptions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the hashin - shtrikman approach , two other widely circulated bounds in the literature are the maxwell - garnett and bruggeman formalisms @xcite .",
    "however , these tighter approaches do not necessarily yield physically realistic estimates in certain parameter regimes @xcite .",
    "recently we have shown that a homogenization procedure based on the tight lower bound given by bergman and milton @xcite is able to predict optical data in dilute nanocomposite materials without the use of any fitting parameters @xcite . in this procedure , the effective dielectric function for a binary metal - dielectric composite can be expressed as follows :    @xmath14}\\right]^{-1}\\label{eq : bergmilt}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 denotes the component s volume fraction , @xmath16 is the component s dielectric function depending on the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic energy with subscripts @xmath17 and @xmath18 referencing the metal and host matrix respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is a geometrical factor taking into account the shape of the metal particles which may posses spatial dependence for non - symmetric inclusion geometries @xcite . for the purposes of this paper we are interested in spherical particles and accordingly choose @xmath20",
    "here , we also assume the spherical inclusions are distributed with enough uniformity in the host matrix that system spatial dependence may also be neglected .",
    "equation [ eq : bergmilt ] represents the effective dielectric function for the two component case of a metal particle embedded in a host dielectric matrix .",
    "note it is customary to let @xmath21 where @xmath22 corresponds to the metal components @xcite .",

    "similarly , ag and au in sio@xmath11 also exhibit strong absorption near their plasmonic responses with respective absorption enhancements in the vicinity of 414 nm and 529 nm , respectively ( fig .",

    "al in sio@xmath11 shows strong absorption in the uv near the edge of the available experimental data ( fig .",

    "it is of interest to note that the resonance response of cu , au , and ag in si@xmath9n@xmath10 all correspond to photon energies below the bandgap of si@xmath9n@xmath10 ( 4.5 ev ) .",

    "we now discuss the optical behavior of dielectric containing nanoparticles of multiple different metals . for the systems considered here ,",
    "the analysis is limited to the dilute case ( i.e. total volume fraction of metal versus dielectric @xmath34 ) because it is desirable from a practical standpoint of expense and fabrication efficiency .",

    "furthermore , nanoparticles of size @xmath36 10 nm can be assembled on many dielectric substrates using robust manufacturing techniques such as those mentioned in the introduction .",
    "figures illustrating the hierarchical mixing process for both 2- and 3-metal mixtures have been presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the top level represents the effective dielectric function for the target nanocomposite of design interest . at each level , the total volume fraction is constrained such that @xmath37 . during the mixing process , the average electric field within the composite is held constant while the final effective permittivity is calculated using equal volumes at each level of mixing . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite : the effective permittivity of an n - component mixture can be determined by mixing n-1 binary mixtures , each comprising of a host and a distinct metal , the host being common to the n-1 pairs .    at the plasmonic resonance ,",
    "the absorption is not infinite in extent and broadened absorption lines are observed due to the finite relaxation times of scattering @xcite . for the case of spherical metal particles of nanometer extent , finite size corrections are introduce through modification of the imaginary portion of the effective dielectric coefficient .",
    "[ eq : teff ] quantifies the effective change in the electron relaxation time due to scattering of electrons on the metal - dielectric interface as a slight modification to the bulk electron relaxation time @xcite expressed by :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the effective electron relaxation time , @xmath40 is the bulk electron relaxation time , @xmath41 corresponds to the particle s diameter and @xmath42 is the velocity of the electrons near the fermi surface .",

    "in fig . [ figappl ] , the optical absorption response obtained by the mixing approach are presented with specific applications in consideration .",

    "we define this `` energy '' for @xmath51 spanning from 200 to 900 nm .",
    "this choice of @xmath52 allows for the absorption profile that most closely resembles the shape of the solar spectrum to be determined .",
    "the algorithm begins by initializing the system to some initial state @xmath53 .",
