    "in the classical world one can easily distinguish between integrable and chaotic systems just by looking at the system s trajectories . upon increasing @xmath0 and entering the quantum world ,",
    "the notion of trajectory loses its meaning and more subtle measures to characterize quantum chaos are needed .",
    "the most common method to reveal the quantum chaotic nature of a system is to look at the spectral statistics of its hamiltonian .",

    "@xcite proposed an alternative measure based on the distribution of the number of nodal domains of the _ wave function_. to have a specific system in mind we consider a particle in a ( two - dimensional ) quantum billiard . in the absence of a magnetic field",
    "one can choose real wave functions .",
    "the nodal domains are now the regions of constant sign ; they are bounded by the nodal lines where the wave function vanishes .    in case of an separable system",
    ", one observes a grid of intersecting nodal lines , whereas in the chaotic case the nodal domains form a highly irregular pattern and nodal intersections are rare @xcite .",
    "similar pattern are also found in gaussian random waves , which are known to be a good model for chaotic wave functions @xcite . here ,",
    "nodal intersections hardly ever occur , i.e. saddle points and nodal lines coincide with vanishing probability . instead",
    ", depending on the sign of the wave function right at a saddle point , junctions between positive ( negative ) regions are formed @xcite ( avoided intersections ) , as illustrated in figure [ bog ] .",
    "bogomolny and schmit @xcite mimic the distribution of nodal domains by the following procedure .",
    "they start from a checkerboard - like lattice of positive and negative regions , where the ( linear ) size of the squares corresponds to the wavelength of the random waves . at each intersection",
    "they place with equal probability and independently a junction ( see figure [ bog ] ) which either connects the positive or negative regions .",
    "since their model belongs to the universality class of critical , _ short - ranged _ percolation , they are able to compute the moments of the numbers of nodal domains , the area distribution and corresponding ( critical ) exponents .    in this article",
    "we argue , that the applicability of short - ranged percolation to the nodal domains of gaussian random waves is not entirely obvious .",
    "we will demonstrate , that distant avoided intersections are in fact correlated . since the correlations are rather weak , they will if at all modify the critical properties of very large systems , which can not be accessed numerically , calling for an analytical scheme to compute the number of domains and their ( mean ) connectivity .",
    "we put forward a possible method in the second part of the article .",
    "we hope that it will ultimately lead to an analytical approach to the problem of counting nodal domains",

    "gaussian random waves might be seen as a superposition @xmath1 of partial waves @xmath2 with fixed energy @xmath3 and amplitudes @xmath4 with a gaussian distribution .",
    "the random waves obey the helmholtz equation @xmath5 and are characterized ( in two dimensions ) by the correlation function @xcite @xmath6where we have set the energy to @xmath7 .",
    "the gaussian average is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the nodal domains are the ( connected ) regions of constant sign of the random field @xmath9 , the nodal lines are at @xmath10 .    in @xcite",
    "the pattern of nodal domains is modelled by a staggered ( checkerboard - like ) lattice of positive and negative regions . with equal probability ( and at each node independently ) either two positive or two negative areas",
    "are connected ( see figure [ bog ] ) .",
    "the equivalent quantity for the random waves is simply the sign of the random field @xmath11 right at the saddle points  if the sign of @xmath11 is positive at the saddle point , the positive regions are connected and vice versa .",
    "therefore , we have to calculate correlations of the density @xmath12 the @xmath13-function picks up the extrema of @xmath11 ( where @xmath14 ) , the determinant of @xmath15 yields the corresponding normalization , and the theta - function singles out the saddle points , which have a negative determinant , see e.g. @xcite .    the calculation of @xmath16 is done in an expansion in terms of @xmath17 .",
    "one might think of @xmath18 as a series in @xmath11 and its derivatives ( to obtain the series expansion , one has to replace at first the @xmath13 , @xmath19 , and sign - function by their respective smooth counterparts ) .",
    "now we perform the gaussian average with the help of the wick theorem .",
    "we have _ internal _ contractions within @xmath20 and within @xmath21 , and contractions _ connecting _ @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we sort the expansion by the number of the latter connections .",
    "the first term of the expansion is obviously @xmath22 it contains all terms , which decay as @xmath23 , whereas the next term in the expansion decays not slower than @xmath24 ( since @xmath18 is antisymmetric in @xmath11 the term @xmath25 vanishes ) .    to obtain the functional derivative of @xmath18",
    ", we add to @xmath11 an infinitesimal ( fixed ) variation @xmath26 and calculate @xmath27,\\bi{r})\\right>$ ] to linear order in @xmath28 .",

    "utilizing once more the wave equation @xmath38 we obtain finally the large distance behaviour of the correlation function @xmath39 the correlations of @xmath18 are in fact long ranged .",
    "the prefactor , however , is extremely small , if compared with a naive guess for the @xmath18 correlation function , namely @xmath40 the prefactor of the naive approximation is @xmath41 times larger than the prefactor of the exact asymptotic result .",
    "the numerical smallness of the @xmath18 correlations is the key to an understanding of the apparent agreement of the results of @xcite with the real random waves @xcite .",
    "one of the two following scenarios might be realized : either the long - ranged correlations are irrelevant due to their oscillatory character and the system belongs to the short - range percolation universality class . or , the behaviour of the system eventually crosses over to a behaviour , which is different from short - range percolation . due to the smallness of ( [ corrbridge ] ) , the crossover will take place at very large systems ( deep in the semiclassical regime)for small systems , one will see percolative behaviour in agreement with @xcite .",
    "in this section we study the percolative structure of the nodal domains of random waves .",
    "to be more specific , we attempt to calculate the moments of the number of nodal domains . as a byproduct",
    "we will obtain the probability , that two points at a distance @xmath42 belong to the same nodal domain . to achieve this we make use of a potts - model `` on top '' of the nodal structure .",
    "for regularization purposes , the nodal domains are placed on a quadratic lattice with a lattice parameter @xmath43 . to each node @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 enumerates the nodes ) of the lattice we assign beside the sign of the random wave @xmath46 a potts spin @xmath47 which takes values @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a given natural number .",
    "we denote the pairs of adjacent nodes by @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 is the sum over all bonds of the square lattice .",
    "we impose now a crucial restriction on the potts - spins : all spins @xmath47 , which belong to the same nodal domain , must have the same value : @xmath52 for all @xmath53 of the same nodal domain .",
    "spins from different domains might have different values .",
    "the constraint is implemented in a local manner : the product over all lattice bonds @xmath54 is one , if and only if all factors are equal to one .",
    "a certain factor is one , if either @xmath55 ( @xmath53 belong to different domains ) or if @xmath53 are in the same domain @xmath56 and the corresponding potts spins are equal @xmath57 .",
    "let us now sum over all possible spin configurations @xmath58 .",
    "for each domain , the spins acquire the @xmath49 different values @xmath48 , i.e. each nodal domain contributes a factor of @xmath49 to the sum @xmath59=\\sum_{\\{s_i\\}}\\prod_{<i , j>}\\left(1-\\frac{1+\\sigma_i\\sigma_j}{2}(1-\\delta_{s_i , s_j})\\right ) = q^c\\]]where @xmath60 is the number of nodal domains .",
    "now we perform the average @xmath61 over the gaussian random field @xmath11 with correlation function ( [ corr ] ) and obtain the partition function @xmath62 where we have in addition exponentiated the statistical weight ( [ constr ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ expo ] ) might be seen as a kind of ( annealed ) diluted potts model similar to the one presented in @xcite with broken bonds along the nodal lines .",
    "now we take the somewhat formal limit @xcite @xmath63 and find for the mean number of nodal domains ( the higher moments can be obtained analogously ) @xmath64 the connectivity of the domains can also be obtained with the help of the above partition function .",
    "spins on different domains are independent , i.e. the correlation of the order parameter @xmath65 vanishes : @xmath66 if both spins are constrained to be equal , the correlation between @xmath67 and @xmath68 is in fact nonzero @xmath69 the correlation function reads now @xmath70 now we take the limit @xmath63 @xmath71perform the average @xmath61 over the gaussian random field @xmath11 , and obtain finally the probability @xmath72 that the points @xmath73 and @xmath74 are connected @xmath75 the model ( [ number ] ) is obviously a direct descendant of the potts model , interpreted as the random - cluster model @xcite . in the usual potts model",
    "@xmath76 the two processes of cluster generation and counting are interwoven ",
    "the expansion of the product generates the different clusters and the summation over the potts - spins counts the number of clusters as in equation ( [ number ] ) . in our formula , we average over the random waves to generate the nodal domains , and average separately over the auxiliary potts - spins to count the domains .",
    "we could show , that the avoided intersections of gaussian random waves show long - ranged correlations , which are not taken into account in the simple percolation model @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not evident , whether both models belong to the same universality class , i.e. share the same critical exponents .    in order to investigate the percolative structure of the nodal domains of random waves , we have proposed a model , which utilizes potts - spins to count the number of domains .",
    "one might easily find variants of this model , e.g. by placing the auxiliary spins on the dual lattice in order to count the nodal lines or by using a `` height - variable '' as in @xcite to obtain the area distribution of the nodal domains .",
    "all models suffer from the fact , that the auxiliary `` spins '' have infinite couplings ( @xmath77 in equation ( [ expo ] ) ) .",
    "otherwise the interaction range of the auxiliary variables would be finite , making it impossible to decide whether distant regions are connected or not .",
    "unfortunately , the infinite couplings complicate calculations and approximations considerably .",
    "the evaluation of the counting formula is therefore left to future investigations .",
    "a helpful first step would be the formulation of a continuous field theory corresponding to equation ( [ expo ] ) .",
    "then , the relevance ( or irrelevance ) of the long - ranged correlations ( [ corrbridge ] ) would become manifest .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank u smilansky for many enlightening discussions and for a critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "i acknowledge the hospitality of the complex systems group at the weizmann institute , where some of this work was done .",
    "i would like to thank a g monastra and h k janssen for useful discussions .",

    "at first we calculate @xmath78 due to the @xmath79 symmetry and due to the fact , that @xmath11 obeys the wave equation @xmath80 .",
