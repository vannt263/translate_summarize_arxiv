    "in the present paper , we consider a scalar conservation law with stochastic forcing @xmath2 and study its approximation in the sense of bhatnagar - gross - krook ( a bgk - like approximation for short ) .",
    "in particular , we aim to describe the conservation law as the hydrodynamic limit of the stochastic bgk model , as the microscopic scale @xmath0 goes to @xmath1 .",
    "the literature devoted to the deterministic counterpart , i.e. corresponding to the situation @xmath3 , is quite extensive ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in that case , the bgk model is given as follows @xmath4 where @xmath5 , the so - called equilibrium function , is defined by @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the derivative of @xmath8 .",
    "the differential operator @xmath9 is with respect to the space variable @xmath10 . the additional real - valued variable @xmath11 is called velocity ; the solution @xmath12 is then a microscopic density of particles at @xmath13 with velocity @xmath11 .",
    "the local density of particles is defined by @xmath14 the collisions of particles are given by the nonlinear kernel on the right hand side of .",
    "the idea is that , as @xmath15 , the solutions @xmath12 of converge to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the unique kinetic or entropy solution of the deterministic scalar conservation law .",
    "the addition of the stochastic term to the basic governing equation is rather natural for both practical and theoretical applications .",
    "such a term can be used for instance to account for numerical and empirical uncertainties and therefore stochastic conservation laws has been recently of growing interest , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the first complete well - posedness result for multi - dimensional scalar conservation laws driven by a general multiplicative noise was obtained by debussche and vovelle @xcite for the case of kinetic solutions . in the present paper",
    ", we extend this result and show that the kinetic solution is the macroscopic limit of stochastic bgk approximations . as the latter are much simpler equations that can be solved explicitly , this analysis can be used for developing innovative numerical schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "the bgk model in the stochastic case reads @xmath18 where the function @xmath19 corresponds to @xmath20 , the local density @xmath21 is given as above , and the function @xmath22 will be defined in .",
    "note , that setting @xmath3 in yields an equation which is equivalent to the deterministic bgk model .",
    "our purpose here is twofold .",
    "first , we make use of the stochastic characteristics method as developed by kunita in @xcite to study a certain auxiliary problem . with this in hand , we fix @xmath0 and prove the existence of a unique weak solution to the stochastic bgk model .",
    "second , we establish a series of estimates uniform in @xmath0 which together with the results of debussche and vovelle @xcite justify the limit argument , as @xmath23 , and give the convergence of the weak solutions of to the kinetic solution of .",
    "let us make some comments on the deterministic bgk model .",
    "even though the general concept of the proof is analogous , we point out that the techniques required by the stochastic case are significantly different .",
    "in particular , the characteristic system for the deterministic bgk model consists of independent equations @xmath24 and the @xmath11-coordinate of the characteristic curve is constant .",
    "accordingly , it is much easier to control the behavior of @xmath12 for large @xmath11 .",
    "namely , if the initial data @xmath25 are compactly supported ( in @xmath11 ) , the same remains valid also for the solution itself and also the convergence proof simplifies . on the contrary , in the stochastic case",
    ", the @xmath11-coordinate of the characteristic curve is governed by an sde and therefore this property is , in general , lost .",
    "similar issues has to be dealt with in order to obtain all the necessary uniform estimates . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", it was needed to develop a suitable method to control the decay at infinity in connection with the remaining variables @xmath26 .",
    "( cf . proposition [ kin ] ) .    using this approach",
    "we are able to prove the convergence of the bgk model under a slightly weaker hypothesis on the initial datum @xmath27 than usually assumed in the deterministic case : it is not supposed to be bounded , we only assume @xmath28 for all @xmath29 . note , that under this condition , the initial data for the deterministic bgk model , for instance @xmath30 , are not compactly supported and so the usual methods are not applicable . in the deterministic case",
    ", however , the boundedness assumption is fairly natural since also the solution @xmath17 to the conservation law remains bounded .",
    "obviously , this is not true for the stochastic case as it is impossible to get any @xmath31 estimates due to the active white noise term .",
    "there is another difficulty coming from the complex structure of the characteristic system for the stochastic bgk model .",
    "namely , the finite speed of propagation that is an easy consequence of boundedness of the solution @xmath17 of the conservation law in the deterministic case ( see for instance @xcite ) is no longer valid and therefore some growth assumptions on the transport coefficient @xmath7 are in place .",
    "the hypothesis of bounded derivatives is natural for the stochastic characteristics method as it implies the existence of global stochastic flows . even though this already includes one important example of burgers equation it is of essential interest to handle also more general coefficients having polynomial growth .",
    "this was achieved by a suitable cut - off procedure which also guarantees all the necessary estimates .",
    "the exposition is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ setting ] , we introduce the basic setting and state the main result , theorem [ main ] . in order to make the paper more self - contained , section [ prelim ] provides a brief overview of two concepts which are the keystones of our proof of existence and convergence of the bgk model .",
    "on the one hand , it is the notion of kinetic solution to stochastic hyperbolic conservation laws , on the other hand , the method of stochastic characteristics for first - order linear spdes .",
    "section [ existence ] is mainly devoted to the existence proof for stochastic bgk model , however , in the subsection [ further ] we establish some important estimates useful in section [ convergence ] .",
    "this final section contains technical details of the passage to the limit and completes the proof of theorem [ main ] .",

    "regarding the stochastic term , let @xmath41 be a stochastic basis with a complete , right - continuous filtration .",
    "the initial datum may be random in general , i.e. @xmath42-measurable , and we assume @xmath43 for all @xmath29 . as we intend to apply the stochastic characteristics method developed by kunita @xcite , we restrict ourselves to finite - dimensional noise . however , our results extend to infinite - dimensional setting once the corresponding properties of stochastic flows are established .",
