    "a total of 2.379 subjects living in the us were recruited using the online labour market amazon mechanical turk ( amt)@xcite and participated in one of four experiments involving money .    in study 1 , 601 subjects earned @xmath18 for participation and were randomly assigned to one of six conditions . in the _",
    "no - exit _ condition participants were asked to decide between _ stealing _ person b s participation fee or _ donating _ their participation fee to person b. subjects in the role of person b participated in the _ guess - no - exit _ condition and they had to guess person a s decision with a @xmath19 reward in case they made the right guess . the _ free - exit _ and _ guess - free - exit _ conditions were similar , with the difference that there was a third choice available to person a , that is , exit the game without doing anything . in this case",
    "both subjects would keep their participation fee . finally , the _ costly - exit _ and _ guess - costly - exit _ conditions differed from the free - exit conditions in that exiting the game costed @xmath20 to person a. after making their decision , participants entered the demographic questionnaire , where we asked for their gender , age , and education level , and the reason of their choice .",
    "full instructions are reported in the supplementary information .",
    "since amt does not allow experimenters to manipulate participation fees , study 1 actually involves deception : participants choices did not have a real impact on their final bonus .",
    "moreover , one may contest the use of the verb `` to steal '' , which , having a strong moral weight , might have driven some participants away from selfish behaviour for other reasons than their altruism .",
    "analysing participants free responses to the question `` why did you make your choice ? '' , we did not find any evidence that participants were aware of the risk of deception ; however , we have found evidence that the use of the verb `` to steal '' may have affected participants choices . indeed , several participants , when describing their choice , declared `` i am not a thief '' , or similar statements .    to exclude",
    "the risk that our results were driven by either of those two causes , study 2 replicates the no - exit condition of study 1 under slightly different conditions .",
    "specifically , in study 2 , 583 subjects kept their participation fee and were given additional @xmath18 as a bonus .",

    "observing altruistic behaviour in the no - exit condition of study 1 and in study 2 will allow us to conclude that there are some subjects who care about the payoff of the other person _ at least as much _ as their own .",
    "the purpose of study 3 ( 395 subjects ) is to strengthen this conclusion showing that a substantial proportion of subjects is _ hyper_-altruist : they care about the payoff of the other person _ more _ than their own .",
    "thus in study 3 , participants kept their participation fee , were given additional @xmath19 , and were randomly assigned to either the exit - condition or the no - exit condition . in the no - exit condition , participants in the role of person a were asked to decide between giving their money to the other person or taking the money from the other person . in the latter case , the money would be doubled and earned by themselves .",

    "we show that four of the best known economic models of human behaviour do not predict existence of hyper - altruistic behavior .",
    "additionally , we show that also the other ( less known ) models we are aware of do not predict existence of hyper - altruistic behavior . while we can not exclude the existence of a model predicting our results , we are now aware of any of them .",

    "let @xmath57 be fixed , person a has to decide between the allocation of money @xmath55 and @xmath54,the first component being for himself and the second component for person b. person b has no active role and only gets what person a decides to give .",
    "we start by analysing the predictions of levine s model of altruism@xcite .",
    "this model assumes that , given an allocation of money @xmath58 , player 1 gets an utility of    @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , the second condition means that no player has a higher regard for his opponents than for himself .",
    "it is easy to see that this property implies that person a strictly prefers the allocation @xmath55 over @xmath54 , independently of the parameters of the model . indeed",
    "this prediction is rejected by the results of studies 1,2 , and 3 .",
    "we now consider fehr & schmidt s inequity aversion model@xcite .",
    "this model assumes that , given an allocation of money @xmath58 , player 1 s utility is    @xmath63    where @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in our case , we have @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "now assume @xmath68 , as it is in studies 1 and 2 , since @xmath64 , it follows that every decision maker prefers @xmath55 over @xmath69 .",
    "this prediction is rejected by the results of studies 1 and 2 .",
    "then we consider bolton & ockenfels inequity aversion model .",
    "this model assumes that , given an allocation of money @xmath58 , with @xmath70 , player 1 s utility is    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are constant .",
    "thus , in our case , we have @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which implies @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , bolton & ockenfels model predicts that every player either prefers the allocation @xmath55 or she is indifferent between the two allocations @xmath55 and @xmath54 ; in other words , no player strictly prefers @xmath54 over @xmath55 .",
    "this prediction is rejected by the analysis of participants free responses , which show that essentially all altruistic subjects were actually hyper - altruistic , that is , they strictly prefer @xmath54 over @xmath55 .    finally , we consider charness & rabin s model@xcite , which assumes that , given an allocation of money @xmath58 , player 1 s utility is    @xmath77    where @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "thus we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath56 , one always have @xmath76 .",
    "thus also charness & rabin model predicts that no players strictly prefer @xmath54 over @xmath55 .",
    "the argument discussed above applies also in this case and rejects this prediction .",
    "we conclude by mentioning that also the other models of human behaviour in one - shot simultaneous - move games that we are aware of fail to predict existence of hyper - altruistic behaviour .",
    "halpern & rong model@xcite assumes that people care also about the total welfare .",
    "however , this model reduces to the money maximisation model in case the total welfare is constant across choices and thus it predicts that players should always choose the allocation @xmath55 over @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , also the cooperative equilibrium model@xcite reduces to the money maximisation model in case the total welfare is constant across choices .",
    "regret minimisation models@xcite instead assume that players compare the payoff obtained when a certain strategy profile is played with the best payoff they could have gotten choosing another strategy and leaving the strategies of the other players constant .",
    "then they try to minimise this _",
    "regret_. it is evident that also this model predicts that every player should prefer the allocation @xmath55 over @xmath69 . finally , the recently proposed model with translucent players@xcite , which is based on the illusion of transparency@xcite , that is the illusion that people s thoughts are visible to other people ( who can respond punishing unfair intentions ) , also reduces to the money maximization model in the case in which the other players have no active role and so they can not punish .",
    "here we have provided evidence of the following three regularities : ( i ) a substantial proportion ( about one sixth ) of people is hyper - altruist , that is , they prefer giving a certain amount of money to an anonymous stranger , rather than taking the same amount of money from the same person ; ( ii ) the majority of people prefer to avoid this conflictual decision and exit the game , but only when the exit - option is costless ; ( iii ) females are more likely than males to exit the game , even when it is costly , but this gender difference tend to vanish when the cost of the exit option increases .",
    "existence of hyper - altruism is certainly our major result , since it is not predicted by any of the dominant economic models , including levine s model of altruism@xcite , fehr & schimdt s and bolton & ockenfels inequity aversion models@xcite , charness & rabin s efficiency maximisation model@xcite , and others@xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any model predicting existence of hyper - altruistic people . as a consequence , it is important to understand what psychological and economic motivations led a substantial percentage of people away from the theoretical predictions .",
    "our results provide a starting point in that they suggest that hyper - altruistic behaviour is driven by three different ( though probably connected ) forces : desire to do the right thing ; desire not to do the wrong thing ; desire to be generous .",
    "further research is necessary to understand how these forces interact and how they can be incorporated into a model of human behaviour .",
    "a recent paper@xcite makes a point similar to our point ( i ) .",
    "there , crockett et al . show that most people evaluate others pain more than their own pain : they pay to avoid an anonymous stranger receiving an electric shock twice as much as they pay to avoid themselves receiving an electric shock .",
    "though similar , our results are different in the way that they point out that there is no need of real physical harm to observe hyper - altruistic behaviour . in our experiment , a substantial proportion of people value others monetary outcome more than their own , without any real physical harm involved .",
    "another paper@xcite makes a point similar to our point ( ii ) , that is that most people prefer to exit the game , rather than making a decision that would harm either of the parties .",
    "there the authors show that about 28% of subjects prefer to exit a dictator game with $ 9 , rather than playing it in the role of the dictator with an endowment of $ 10 .",
    "more precisely , participants in ref .",
    "21 played a two - stage game : stage 1 was a standard dictator game where participants in the role of the dictator had to decide how to allocate $ 10 between them and an anonymous recipient , knowing that the recipient would not have any active role .",
    "after making the decision , but before telling it to the recipient and before telling to the recipient that they were playing a dictator game in the role of the recipient , the dictators played stage 2 , in which they were asked whether they wanted to stick with their decision or leave the game with $ 9 . in this latter case",
    ", the recipient would not be informed of the fact that they were supposed to be the recipient in a dictator game .",
    "the authors found that 11 subjects ( corresponding to 28% of the total ) preferred to exit the game .",
    "our results extend this finding to conflictual situations and they also make a little step forward : in ref .",
    "21 , only two of the 11 subjects who decided to exit the game had decided to keep the whole endowment for themselves in the first stage of the game .",
    "thus it is possible that the fact that the strategy space has been changed from stage 1 to stage 2 , and the fact that the recipient does not have complete knowledge of the decision problem , have changed some people s preferences , which in stage 2 act just as money - maximising .",
    "contrariwise , our experiment is a one - stage experiment where both parties have complete knowledge of the decision problem and so it shows that a substantial proportion of people truly have preferences for opting out .",
    "our point ( iii ) is reminiscent of the pretty well established result that females are more giving than males in the dictator game@xcite .",
    "however , it goes beyond it , suggesting that females are not only more sharing than males , but they also have a stronger tendency to exit from a conflictual situation even at a personal cost . while this result is intriguing , we recommend caution on its interpretation .",
    "study 3 suggests that when the cost of the exit option increases , gender differences in taking the exit option tend to disappear .",
    "further research may help understand how robust is the result that females are more likely than males to exit from a conflict and how far it can be generalised .",
    "we also believe that further research should be devoted to see whether there are behavioral differences between two - person conflicts and n - person conflicts , with @xmath81 .",
    "if hyper - altruism is partly driven by moral reasoning , as our analysis of free responses suggests , such a difference might exist , since `` harming more people is worse than harming only one person '' and `` helping more people is better than helping only one person '' .",
    "we tried to handle a similar problem exploring a three - person conflict ( study 4 ) , but there , harming one person was balanced by helping the third person and thus subjects did not really have the opportunity to harm both people at the same time .",
    "a posteriori , it is not a big surprise that our experiment was not successful and that behaviour in our three - person conflict turned out to be statistically equivalent to behaviour in the two - person conflicts reported in studies 1 and 2 .    finally , we believe that it would be important to understand what psychological consequences such hyper - altruism can have within a person . if a person is available to pay 1 cent to increase the payoff of an anonymous stranger of 1 cent , it is likely that the same person would sacrifice much more to help a closely related person .",
    "such people may thus experience extreme forms of active sacrifice@xcite in their everyday life , such as _ unmitigated communion _ , that is the extreme focus on others without the balance of a focus on self@xcite . since unmitigated communion is known to cause anxiety , depressive symptoms , lower self - esteem , and poorer physical health@xcite",
    ", it would be important to understand the extent to which it can be captured by simple economic games such as the ones we have introduced .",

    "<S> have played a fundamental role in the early evolution of human societies@xcite and modern variants of these attitudes play a major role still nowadays : we help friends when they need , we make donations to less fortunate people , we collaborate with our partner to build a family , we cooperate with our colleagues to finish the work faster and at higher standards . </S>",
    "<S> lab experiments show that our pro - social abilities go far beyond the five rules of cooperation@xcite : people show pro - social behavior also in one - shot lab experiments with anonymous participants@xcite and even in large groups@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a major consequence of our pro - social abilities is that our social network is far more connected than that of any other animal species . </S>",
    "<S> while this dense spatial structure has numerous well known positive consequences@xcite , it also generates a painful paradox : with all the people we are connected with , it is often difficult to make everyone happy : sometimes the goals of two people are just not aligned ; sometimes we have to choose between hurting person a or hurting person b ; perhaps even worse , sometimes we have to choose between hurting ourselves or hurting someone else - and sometimes , this someone else is a close friend , or a close relative , or our romantic partner .    despite the practical importance of such conflicts , </S>",
    "<S> little is known about how real people behave in these situations in the ideal scenario of a lab experiment with anonymous subjects . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> only one study@xcite addressed this problem , showing that most people are `` hyper - altruistic '' , that is , they evaluate others pain more than their own pain : they pay to avoid an anonymous stranger receiving an electric shock twice as much as they pay to avoid themselves receiving an electric shock .    here </S>",
    "<S> we go beyond real physical harm and we show that hyper - altruistic behavior can be observed also in simple economic decisions where no real physical harm is involved . </S>",
    "<S> a major upside of this purely economic approach is that it provides a straight proof that economic models are somehow incomplete , since ( as it will be shown in the results section ) they do not predict existence of hyper - altruistic subjects .    more precisely , here we report experiments on two types of conflicts , those with an exit option and those without an exit option . </S>",
    "<S> the typical conflict with no exit option involves two people , person a and person b. person a has to decide between two allocations of money @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the amount @xmath5 being for himself and the amount @xmath6 for person b. person b has no active role and only gets what person a decides to give . </S>",
    "<S> the two allocations of money are assumed to be in conflict , that is @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> conflicts with an exit option differ from those without an exit option in that person a can exit the game without making any decisions , but paying an amount @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> thus here person a has a third choice available , that is the allocation of money @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the _ cost _ of the exit option to be @xmath11 , that is , the difference between the benefit that person a would get by exiting the game compared with the worst case scenario , and the loss that person a would incur if he takes the exit instead of maximising his income .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in testing three hypotheses . </S>",
    "<S> first , in line with the results presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 20 , we expect to observe hyper - altruistic behavior to a larger extent than predicted by economic models . </S>",
    "<S> second , motivated by the results reported in ref . 21 , which show that a substantial proportion of subjects prefer exiting a dictator game rather than playing it , we expect to see a preference for opting out also in our conflictual situations , at least when the exit option is costless . </S>",
    "<S> third , motivated by the pretty well established fact that females are more giving than males in the dictator game@xcite , we suspect that there might be gender differences also in behaviour in conflictual situations .    to test these hypotheses , </S>",
    "<S> we have conducted three studies ( studies 1 , 2 , and 3 ) to explore human behaviour in two - person conflicts with or without an exit option and with different parameter specifications . </S>",
    "<S> details about the designs are reported in the method section and results are reported in the results section . here </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that we have found evidence of four regularities :    1 .   in the conditions with a costless exit option ( @xmath12 ) , the majority of subjects exit the game ; 2 .   in the conditions with a costly exit option ( @xmath13 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the majority of subjects act selfishly . </S>",
    "<S> statistically , the proportion of people exiting the game is the same as the proportion of people acting altruistically in the conditions with no exit option . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> females are more likely than males to exit the game , but only when the cost of the exit option is small . as the cost of the exit option increases , gender differences in taking the exit option tend to disappear . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there are no statistically significant gender differences in the conditions with no exit option . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .   in the conditions with no exit option , </S>",
    "<S> participants were more altruistic than predicted by the dominant economic models .    indeed , in the results </S>",
    "<S> section we will show that the observed proportion of _ hyper - altruistic _ subjects can not be explained by any of the dominant economic models , including levine s model of altruism@xcite , fehr & schmidt s and bolton & ockenfels inequity aversion models@xcite , charness & rabin s efficiency maximisation model@xcite , and others@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , since every participant was asked to describe the reason of his or her choice , with the help of a coder we could analyse the motivation underlying each participant s decision . we have found evidence that hyper - altruistic participants are likely to have some sort of non - consequentialist moral preferences : they either think that taking money from someone else is wrong , or that giving money to someone else is right - independently of the economic consequences .    </S>",
    "<S> this finding suggests that increasing the moral weight of the decision problem may have a positive effect on altruistic behavior . in particular , it is possible that taking money from an anonymous person and split it with a third party is perceived to be even `` more wrong '' than just taking money from an anonymous person . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this observation , we have conducted one more study ( study 4 ) to investigate whether there is a behavioural transition when passing from two - person conflicts to three - person conflicts . </S>",
    "<S> here , in the condition with no exit option , person a has to decide among three allocations of money , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , the first component being for himself and the other two components for person b and person c , who have no active role . in the condition with an exit option , person a has a fourth option available , according to which he or she can exit the game at no cost , which corresponds to the allocation @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we found the same pattern as in studies 1 , 2 , and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> most subjects exit the game when the exit option is available and females are more likely than males to exit the game . </S>",
    "<S> when no exit option is available , a substantial proportion of subjects act altruistically . </S>",
    "<S> however , we found that the frequency of altruistic behavior in this three - person conflict does not significantly differ from the frequency of altruistic behavior observed in the two - person conflicts </S>",
    "<S> .    taken together , our findings shed light on human decision - making in conflictual situations and provide evidence that the dominant economic models should be revised in order to take into account hyper - altruistic behaviour . </S>"
