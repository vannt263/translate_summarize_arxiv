    "the first most comprehensive account of the properties of left - handed materials ( lhms ) , i.e. , materials simultaneously exhibiting negative real parts of the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability in a certain frequency interval , was given by veselago  @xcite . as he pointed out , a negative refractive index may be attributed to such materials , leading to a number of unusual optical phenomena . while natural materials with a negative real part of the permittivity such as plasmas  @xcite or a negative real part of the permeability such as some ferrites  @xcite exist , lhms have not yet been found in nature . during the last decade ,",
    "significant progress in the fabrication of lhms in laboratories has been achieved .",
    "metamaterials based on periodic arrays of split ring resonators and a grid of metallic rods have been reported to exhibit left - handedness in the microwave region  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a two - dimensional material consisting of a metal  insulator  metal waveguide has been experimentally demonstrated to show a negative refractive index in the optical region  @xcite .",
    "the effective permittivity and permeability of such metamaterials , valid on length scales which are sufficiently large in comparison to the elementary building blocks of the material , are determined either theoretically @xcite or by means of reflection experiments @xcite .    as already indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , a planar lhm slab with a negative refractive index has the interesting property of being able to focus light  an effect which suggests the possibility of realizing a so - called superlens for subwavelength imaging with a resolution well beyond the diffraction limit  @xcite .",
    "the superlens concept has been a subject of intense discussion  @xcite , and limiting factors such as the finite dimension of the lens  @xcite or the influence of absorption have been studied  @xcite .    in view of the unusual properties of lhms",
    ", it has also been of interest to study the modifications of dispersion forces in the presence of magneto - electric materials . in particular",
    ", the question of whether a left - handedness may lead to a repulsive casimir force between two magneto - electric plates has been addressed  @xcite . from the study of van der waals ( vdw ) forces on single  @xcite and between two ground - state atoms",
    "@xcite in the presence of a planar system exhibiting magneto - electric properties , it has been shown that the attractive / repulsive behavior of the potential is influenced by the strength of the magnetic properties rather than by the left - handedness .",
    "this may be attributed to the fact that in both cases the atoms are in the ground state , so the vdw forces represent off - resonant interactions that involve integrals over the whole frequency range .",
    "hence , frequency intervals where no left - handedness occurs will inevitably also contribute to the force and counteract the effect of the left - handedness ; this becomes evident after expressing the force in terms of an integral over the imaginary frequency axis where both the permittivity and the permeability are always real and positive .",
    "similar arguments also apply to the abovementioned casimir force between two magneto - electric plates , where a repulsive behavior has also been found to primarily require strong magnetic rather than left - handed properties  @xcite .",
    "two strategies might be envisaged to enhance the influence of left - handed properties on dispersion forces .",
    "the first one would be to consider a material exhibiting left - handedness over a sufficiently large ( real ) frequency range , as recently discussed in the context of the casimir force  @xcite ; however , such an requirement is , in general , in conflict with the causality requirements met by all physical media .",
    "secondly , one may consider excited systems like amplifying media as also addressed in ref .",
    "the fundamental difference between absorbing and amplifying media requires , however , a careful reconsideration of the underlying quantum electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the situation is more transparent in the case of an excited atom where the necessary theory of vdw forces is readily available  @xcite .",
    "excited atoms give rise to resonant force components which directly depend on the frequencies of possible downward transitions .",
    "if a material exhibits left - handed properties at one such frequency , one may expect these to influence the dispersion forces in a more significant way .",
    "the spontaneous emission of an excited atom situated in vacuum in the vicinity of a perfect mirror combined with a lossless lhm slab is studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is noticed that a slab of unity negative refraction has the peculiar feature of making the space between atom and mirror appear of zero optical length when the atom ",
    "slab distance is equal to the thickness of the slab . for such positions ,",
    "called focal points , complete suppression of the spontaneous emission for a dipole moment parallel to the surface , and enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate by a factor of two for a dipole moment perpendicular to the surface is reported .",
    "more recently , it has been pointed out that in reality inhibition of spontaneous decay can be weakened due to nonradiative decay at short distances and due to radiative decay at large distances  @xcite .    motivated by refs .",

    "however , at some threshold value of @xmath19 , the height of the barrier starts to be reduced , and eventually the barrier disappears when the slab is too thick .",

    "it is seen from the figures that the distance from the surface at which a relatively strong attractive potential can occur increases with the slab thickness .",

    "the figure shows that almost complete inhibition of spontaneous decay is possible for both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the dipole moment with respect to the surface of a slab that is not lefthanded .",
    "the macroscopic theory employed in this paper breaks down on length scales which are comparable to the size of the elementary building blocks of the metamaterial employed . in order to observe the predicted effects ,",
    "one thus has to ensure that both the atomic transition wavelength and the atom  surface separation are larger than this length scale . with currently available metamaterials ,",
    "this can most readily be achieved with polar molecules whose rotational and vibrational transition wavelengths can be very large .",
    "for example , the bulk meta - material reported in ref .",
    "@xcite exhibits negative refraction with @xmath157 at a frequency of 1.03 thz ; it consists of unit cells with lattice constant @xmath158 .",
    "the frequency of the first rotational transition of a nh molecule ( about 1 thz @xcite ) falls within this frequency window , with the associated wavelength being sufficiently large in comparison with the lattice constant .",
    "one could expect the macroscopic results to be valid down to molecule ",
    "surface separations of @xmath159 , which corresponds to @xmath160 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath161 can be reached by using molecules with larger transition wavelengths .",
    "let us briefly comment on the strength of the force @xmath162 associated with a potential of the type shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . in this context",
    ", it may be convenient to express the potential and the force in terms of the spontaneous decay rate  @xmath163 . from eqs .",
    "( [ equ0 ] ) , ( [ equ1 ] ) , and  ( [ gamma0 ] ) it follows that @xmath164 , where a dipole moment parallel to the surface has been assumed .",
    "consider an excited hydrogen - like atom with a transition having spontaneous decay rate @xmath165 and wavelength @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "if the atom is at rest relative to the slab , the force that can counter the gravitation force and so levitate the atom has to be larger than @xmath167 .",
    "this can be achieved easily .",
    "for example , the peak value of the force corresponding to the potential barrier represented by the dotted line in fig .  [ fig2](a ) is @xmath168 .",
    "consider now a situation where one has a sample of a dilute gas of excited atoms at some temperature .",
    "take again hydrogen - like atoms with the same excited level as above . at a temperature of @xmath169 , the kinetic energy of each particle",
    "is @xmath170 .",
    "a lhm slab of thickness @xmath171 , permittivity and permeability @xmath172 then provides a potential barrier of a height of @xmath173 .",
    "this potential barrier is high enough to levitate the sample of the dilute atomic gas . with an appropriate arrangement ,",
    "it clearly can be employed as a trapping mechanism .",
    "one may also think of an ( evaporative ) cooling apparatus .",
    "the kinetic energy is an averaged quantity .",
    "some atoms among the gas sample can have kinetic energy exceeding the average and higher than the potential barrier .",
    "these can overcome the barrier and get adsorbed by the walls , in so doing lowering the average kinetic energy of the remaining ( a little more diluted ) gas sample .",
    "it should be pointed out that in the examples meta - materials with very small absorption are assumed , which are still beyond the reach of today s experimental techniques .",
    "furthermore , since excited atoms are considered , the effects predicted hold only for time periods short compared to the atomic lifetime .",
    "a more refined theory should include the broadening and shifting of the atomic transition frequency .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the resonant vdw potential experienced by an excited two - level atom in front of a meta - material slab backed by a perfect mirror , with emphasis on a lhm slab with unity negative real part of both the permittivity and the permeability , and an atom located in vacuum .",
    "we have shown that material absorption has to be taken into account in order to avoid divergent values of the potential when the atom  surface separation becomes smaller than the slab thickness . only for values of the atom  surface separation which are larger than the slab thickness ,",
    "disregarding of absorption leads to reasonable results provided that absorption is sufficiently small .",
    "further , we have shown that the setup can be used to form potential barriers for excited atoms  barriers that are typically of several orders of magnitude higher than those observed for ground - state atoms .",
    "in particular , they are significant enough to suggest potential use in quantum levitation , trapping , or cooling of atoms .",
    "the barriers are results of competing contributions from @xmath26- and @xmath25-polarized waves , thus are peculiar to atoms with dipole moments parallel to the surface . for random atomic dipole moment orientations ,",
    "a corresponding averaging has to be applied which may lead to a reduction of the barrier height .",
    "finally , we have revisited the effect of the lhm slab on the spontaneous decay of the excited atom .",
    "we have shown that already an arbitrarily small but finite amount of material absorption can drastically change the decay compared to that predicted when absorption is ignored .",
    "in particular near the surface , absorption gives rise to a noticeable enhancement of the decay . as a prospective task",
    ", the theory could be expanded to other systems such as spherically or cylindrically symmetric ones , amplifying instead of absorbing media could be assumed , and the vdw interaction between excited atoms near a macroscopic body of meta - material could be investigated ."
