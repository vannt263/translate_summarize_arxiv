    "a natural object to consider when studying an asymptotically ( approximately ) de sitter spacetime , such as the universe during the inflationary era , is the wavefunction @xcite as a function of small fluctuations of the bulk fields . for a free massless scalar @xmath7 ( such as the inflaton in slow roll inflation ) in the bunch - davies vacuum state @xmath8 @xcite in a fixed four - dimensional de sitter background",
    ": @xmath9 one finds the late time hartle - hawking gaussian wavefunctional at @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath11 | \\sim \\exp \\left[{- \\frac{{\\ell^2}}{2 } \\int \\frac{d^{3 } k}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\ ; k^3 \\ ;   \\varphi_{\\vec{k } } \\ ; \\varphi_{-\\vec{k } } } \\right]~,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the fourier components of the late time profile @xmath13 .",
    "such a gaussian wavefunction gives rise to the scale - invariant fluctuations of the cosmic background radiation .",
    "understanding the behavior of such a wavefunction for a large range of values for its arguments , which include the metric , and with the inclusion of quantum corrections is a basic problem in quantum cosmology .",
    "the perturbative bunch - davies wavefunction ( [ massless ] ) was noticed to be a simple analytic continuation @xcite of the partition function of a free massless field in a fixed euclidean anti - de sitter space .",
    "these observations , coupled with the correspondence between anti - de sitter space and conformal field theory , motivate the proposal that at late times ( or large spatial volume ) @xmath14 is computed by a statistical ( and hence euclidean ) conformal field theory , in what has come to be known as the ds / cft conjecture @xcite . in its weakest",
    "form ds / cft conjectures that the taylor coefficients of the logarithm of the late time hartle - hawking wavefunctional expanded about the empty de sitter vacuum at large @xmath15 are the correlation functions of such a non - unitary cft .",
    "namely , at some late time cutoff @xmath10 we have : @xmath16 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{n ! } \\left ( \\int   d^3 { x}_1 \\ldots \\int d^3 { x}_n   \\ ; \\varphi(\\vec{x}_1 ) \\ldots \\varphi(\\vec{x}_n ) \\ ; \\langle \\mathcal{o}(\\vec{x}_1 ) \\ldots   \\mathcal{o}(\\vec{x}_n ) \\rangle_{cft } \\right)~.\\ ] ] the correlators @xmath17 , where the operator @xmath18 has been rescaled by an appropriate @xmath19 dependent factor , compute late time bulk correlation functions with future boundary conditions @xcite . the bulk late time profiles @xmath13 are taken to be infinitesimal such that @xmath20 $ ] is merely a generating function of late time correlators about @xmath21 . in its strongest form ,",
    "the claim is that the cft is a non - perturbative definition of @xmath14 for finite deviations away from the pure de sitter vacuum and at finite @xmath22 .",
    "particularly , @xmath14 is computed by the partition function of the putative cft with sources turned on .",
    "the single - trace operators are dual to the bulk de sitter fields .",
    "abstractly speaking , if we could write down a complete basis @xmath23 ( which may include information about topology , geometry and matter ) for the hilbert space of our theory , @xmath14 would be computing the overlap of the hartle - hawking state @xmath8 with a particular state @xmath24 .",
    "one could also consider computing the partition function with sources for more general multi - trace operators turned on . as we shall see",
    "this computes the overlap of @xmath8 with states which are not sharp eigenstates of the field operator or its conjugate momentum .",
    "more dramatically , if there are single - trace operators which are irrelevant they may correspond to an exit from the de sitter phase ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "de sitter space arises as a non - linear classical solution to four - dimensional higher spin gravity @xcite .",
    "this theory has a tower of light particles with increasing spin , including a spinless bulk scalar with mass @xmath25 and a spin - two graviton .",
    "the scalar potential has a minimum about the pure de sitter solution and the kinetic terms of the higher spin particles carry the right signs and are canonical .",
    "hence the de sitter vacuum is perturbatively stable and free of tachyons and ghosts in this theory .",
    "beyond perturbation theory , the late time hartle - hawking wavefunctional of asymptotically de sitter space in higher spin gravity ( at least when the topology at @xmath3 is sufficiently simple ) is conjectured to be computed by the partition function of the @xmath0 model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , with @xmath26 .",
    "this model comes in two flavors , either a free theory of @xmath22 anti - commuting scalar fields transforming as vectors under the @xmath0 symmetry or as a critical theory obtained from the @xmath0 model by a double trace deformation @xcite .",
    "the partition function of the critical model ( at least at large @xmath22 ) as a functional of the sources of the single - trace operators computes the wavefunction in the ordinary field basis . on the other hand",
    ", the free theory computes the wavefunction in a slightly modified basis .",
    "the quantum mechanical analogue of this basis is given by eigenstates of the hermitian operator @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "given the wavefunction in the coordinate basis @xmath30 we can compute in the @xmath31-basis by performing the transform : @xmath32 normalizability in the @xmath33-basis implies normalizability in the @xmath31-basis and vice - versa .",
    "however , a node - less @xmath30 will not necessarily give a node - less @xmath34 .",
    "the free @xmath0 model computes the late time hartle - hawking wavefunction of the bulk scalar in the eigenbasis of the late time operator @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bulk scalar field operator and @xmath37 is the field momentum density operator .",
    "we have taken @xmath38 as a late time cutoff and the combination @xmath39 represents the spatial metric at this time in fefferman - graham gauge .",
    "it is somewhat remarkable that there exists a basis for which the wavefunctional is computed by a free dual theory given that in the ordinary field basis it is computed by a strongly coupled theory .",
    "the partition function of the free @xmath0 theory on an @xmath40 topology is an explicit resummation of the correlation functions and there are no non - perturbative phenomena .",
    "the remaining coordinates of the wavefunctional , which are late time profiles of the higher spin fields including the bulk graviton , are computed in the ordinary field basis for both the free and critical models .",
    "the wavefunctionals for the bulk scalar in the two different bases are related by a functional version of the transform ( [ tranqminv ] ) . as shown in @xcite , in the large @xmath22 limit performing the transform amounts to finding the saddles of a functional equation .",
    "one of these saddles ( not necessarily the dominant one ) gives the field basis wavefunction whose perturbative expansion agrees with that computed perturbatively in the bulk about the pure de sitter solution . in most of what follows",
    ", we will perform computations in the @xmath41-basis , which amounts to the calculation of a functional determinant .",
    "this is a considerably hard object to compute and we will limit ourselves to situations where we have conditioned all bulk fields except the metric @xmath42 and the scalar @xmath7 to have vanishing late time profiles . we should emphasize that this amounts to a very sharp conditioning and ultimately the situation could be altered by allowing higher spin deformations .",
    "the main body of this paper is dedicated to the study of the partition function of the @xmath0 model for a large class of @xmath1 preserving deformations of the bulk scalar and graviton . that is to say we study the late time wavefunction for bulk graviton and scalar configurations with late time profile on an @xmath40 topology : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the round metric on an @xmath45 whose @xmath1 symmetry is the one preserved .",
    "we also study the analogous problem on an @xmath46 topology , which amounts to a simple conformal transformation of the @xmath40 case , where the late time profiles take the form : @xmath47 this allows us to examine the behavior of the wavefunction of higher spin de sitter space for inhomogeneous and anisotropic deformations which extend the rather uniform and homogenous deformations studied in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was found that the wavefunction in the @xmath41-basis diverges as a function of uniform mode of the bulk scalar on the round metric on @xmath46 .",
    "one of the questions we would like to understand is whether such non - normalizabilities persist for less ` global ' late time configurations such as the above @xmath1 deformations .",
    "the above metric deformations are conformally equivalent to the flat / round metric on @xmath2 .",
    "we find particularly striking numerical evidence , discussed in section [ secconj ] , that upon fixing the uniform mode of the bulk scalar on @xmath46 ( in the conformal frame where it is endowed with the standard metric ) all other directions of a general @xmath1 late time deformation are normalizable .",
    "we have also analyzed a different geometric deformation , this time homogeneous but anisotropic , which does not keep the metric in the same conformal class .",
    "this is a squashing deformation @xmath28 of the round metric on @xmath46 expressed as an @xmath48 fiber over an @xmath45 : @xmath49 along with a uniform late time profile for the bulk scalar .",
    "when @xmath50 the metric ( [ squashedsphere ] ) reduces to the standard metric on @xmath46 . once again , so long as the scalar profile is kept fixed we find that the wavefunction is bounded in the @xmath28 direction .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the @xmath0 model in section [ sectwo ] . in section [ secfour ] , using technology developed in @xcite , we compute the wavefunction ( in the @xmath41-basis ) for some gaussian radial deformations of the bulk scalar .",
    "this amounts to computing a functional determinant of a scalar field with a radially dependent mass term . in section [ balloonsec ]",
    "we compute the wavefunction for a radial deformation of the geometry , in the presence of a radial mass deformation , that takes it from the flat metric on @xmath40 to a general form @xmath51 . in section [ secconj ]",
    "we compute the wavefunction for several harmonics on the three - sphere and linear combinations thereof and note that the wavefunction seems to diverge only when the zero harmonic becomes large and negative .",
    "we then discuss the behavior of the wavefunction on a squashed sphere with a uniform profile of the late time bulk scalar in section [ secthree ] .",
    "in section [ secthreehalf ] we make some general remarks about double trace deformations .",
    "we end by speculating on possible extensions of higher spin holography in section [ secsix ] .",
    "most of our calculations can carry over to the @xmath52 model and its ads@xmath53 dual in higher spin gravity @xcite .",
    "we wish to study the hartle - hawking wavefunctional of an asymptotically de sitter higher spin gravity for deformations of the bulk scalar and graviton away from the pure de sitter solution .",
    "we will restrict the topology of space to be @xmath40 or @xmath46 and allow only deformations that decay sufficiently fast at infinity . in this section ,",
    "we remind the reader of the @xmath0 theory and discuss how to compute its functional determinant for certain @xmath1 invariant radial deformations .",
    "one motivation to do so is to understand the behavior of the wavefunction of higher spin de sitter space for mass deformations that are more ` localized ' than those studied in @xcite which were uniform over the entire @xmath46 .",
    "it is also worth noting that computing analogous pieces of the hartle - hawking wavefunction for a simple toy model of einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field with a simple potential would require significant numerical work even in the classical limit , let alone at finite @xmath22 .",
    "one would have to find a complex solution of the euclidean equations of motion that caps off smoothly in the interior and has the prescribed boundary values at large volume , and compute its on - shell action .",
    "recall that the action of the free @xmath0 model on a curved background @xmath42 with a source , @xmath54 , turned on for the @xmath55 operator ( dual to the bulk scalar ) is given by : @xmath56}{8 } \\chi^a \\chi^b   + m(x^i ) \\chi^a \\chi^b \\right)~ , \\quad \\ { a , b\\ } = 1,2,\\ldots , n~,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 should be even .",
    "the fields @xmath57 are anti - commuting scalars that transform as @xmath0 vectors and @xmath58 is the symplectic form . notice that due to the presence of the conformal coupling , the action is invariant under a local weyl transformation of the metric : @xmath59 , so long as we also rescale the source as @xmath60 . from the bulk point of view",
    "this amounts to performing a coordinate transformation @xmath61 , as can be seen by studying the starobinski - fefferman - graham expansion @xcite near @xmath62 : @xmath63 notice that @xmath64 is _ not _ the coefficient of the slowest falling power of @xmath65 for bulk scalar . at the linearized level ,",
    "the @xmath66 profile is dual to the vev of the @xmath67 operator in the presence of an infinitesimal @xmath54 source .    computing the late time hartle - hawking wavefunctional in the @xmath41-basis with @xmath68 amounts to computing the partition function of the @xmath0 theory with finite sources turned on . given that it is a gaussian theory , we can integrate out the anti - commuting @xmath57 fields and find:@xmath69 = z_{free } [ g_{ij } , m(x^i ) ] = \\left ( \\det \\left [ - \\nabla_g^2 + \\frac{r[g]}{8 } + m(x^i ) \\right ] \\right)^{n/2}~,\\ ] ] where : @xmath70 \\equiv \\prod_{a=1}^n \\int \\mathcal{d } \\chi^a \\ ; e^{-s[\\chi^a , m(x^i)]}~.\\ ] ] in the case of a metric @xmath71 that is conformally equivalent to the flat metric on @xmath40 , it is convenient to compute the functional determinant in the conformal frame where @xmath42 is the flat metric .",
    "this amounts to rescaling the source to : @xmath72 we will use this fact in section [ balloonsec ] .",
    "we have seen that for conformally flat metrics our problem reduces to computing a functional determinant : @xmath73~,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the laplacian of the round metric on @xmath40 , namely @xmath75 .",
    "the above object is badly divergent unless we regulate it somehow .",
    "we will regulate it using a heat kernel or zeta function approach , both of which give the same answer .",
    "in fact , this precise problem has been studied by dunne and kirsten in @xcite for functions @xmath76 which only depend on the radial coordinate , i.e. @xmath77 , and which vanish sufficiently fast at infinity .",
    "it was shown that the zeta function regulated determinant is given by the following sum : @xmath78 } { \\det \\left [ - \\nabla^2 + \\mu^2   \\right ] } \\right ) = \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty ( 2l+1 ) \\left ( \\log t^{(l)}(\\infty ) - \\frac { \\int_0^\\infty dr \\ ;",
    "r \\ ; \\hat{m}(r )   } { 2 l+1 } \\right)~.\\ ] ] in the above , the factor @xmath79 originates from the degeneracy of eigenfunctions on a two - sphere and @xmath80 solves the equation : @xmath81 \\frac{d}{dr } t^{(l ) } ( r ) + \\hat{m}(r ) t^{(l)}(r ) = 0~,\\ ] ] with boundary conditions @xmath82 and @xmath83 . the parameter @xmath84 is a constant mass parameter that we will set to zero .",
    "the derivation of the above formula employs the gelfand - yaglom theorem @xcite , which expresses the regulated functional determinant of a one - dimensional schrdinger operator in terms of a single boundary value problem .",
    "the problem of computing the logarithm of a ratio of functional determinants for purely radial operators reduces to an infinite number of gelfand - yaglom problems , one for each @xmath85 , whose solutions need to be summed ( this is the first piece on the right hand side of ( [ dunne ] ) ) and regularized ( this is the second piece on the right hand side of ( [ dunne ] ) ) .",
    "the applicability of the formula requires @xmath86 to vanish faster than @xmath87 at infinity , and these are the only types of deformations for which we will compute the wavefunction in the latter sections . when implementing the above formula we must sum up to a certain cutoff @xmath88 which we take to be @xmath89 .",
    "a discussion of how the error decreases with @xmath90 is given in appendix [ r3s3 ] .",
    "the purpose of this section is to exploit the general formula ( [ dunne ] ) for a simple set of radial functions . by studying @xmath14 as a functional of @xmath86 we can identify some qualitative features already observed in @xcite , such as regions where the wavefunction oscillates and grows exponentially , as well as some new ones .",
    "furthermore , we can study its dependence on more detailed features of the localized deformation .",
    "the zeroes of the wavefunction in the @xmath41-basis occur only when the effective potential @xmath91 of the differential operator @xmath92 is negative for some range of @xmath93 .",
    "if the effective potential were positive for all @xmath93 it could not have vanishing eigenvalues , and hence the wavefunction could not vanish .",
    "thus , we expect all oscillations of the wavefunction in the @xmath41-basis to occur in directions where @xmath86 is negative for some range of @xmath93 .",
    "assessing the magnitude of the wavefunction as a functional of @xmath86 is a more complicated task .",
    "we observe that the wavefunctional acquires increasingly high local maxima between its oscillations only in regions where the quantity @xmath94 appearing in ( [ dunne ] ) becomes large and negative .",
    "it is important to note that because we are working with the flat metric on @xmath40 , which has no scale , our functional determinants will have an associated scaling symmetry given by @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we should thus fix the scaling when studying the functional determinant / wavefunction .     ) on the left , ( [ r2gauss ] ) in the middle and ( [ dbgauss ] ) on the right .",

    "we show a plot of the functional determinant .",
    "we immediately notice the same qualitative feature that was present for the constant mass deformation on a round @xmath46 ( displayed later on in figure [ sigmafig ] ) .      for @xmath103 for the gaussian profile ( [ gauss ] ) with @xmath104 using @xmath89 .",

    "ideally , it would be useful to analyze a qualitatively similar geometric deformation that would take the original geometry outside its conformal class , but we must restrict to the former case in this section since we will be constrained by considering @xmath1 preserving deformations .",

    "as we approach @xmath142 , the size of the two - sphere tends to vanish at @xmath141 eventually pinching the geometry into a warped three - sphere and a slightly deformed metric on @xmath40 .",
    "the choice ( [ noconical ] ) ensures there are no conical singularities at the pinching point .",

    "a schematic representation of this deformation , for positive @xmath144 , is presented in figure [ schematic ] .",

    "one might suspect that these will be the continuations of the higher spin bound states previously discussed for the anti - de sitter case .",
    "thus we see that even though the fundamental constituents ( i.e. the higher spin particles ) of such an extension of higher spin de sitter gravity are not pathological ( at least at the level of perturbation theory ) , they may form configurations which resemble tachyonic fields in de sitter space .",
    "it is of interest to understand whether the late time behavior of such a theory can ever be asymptotically de sitter @xcite . from the cft point of view",
