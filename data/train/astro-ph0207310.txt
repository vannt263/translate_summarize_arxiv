    "the strong winds of lbvs show a wide variety of mass - loss behaviour . during their sdor - type variations they expand in radius at approximately constant luminosity . in some cases the mass loss increases",
    "while the star expands ( e.g. r71 ) , whereas for others ( e.g. r110 ) the behaviour is the exact opposite : as the star expands , its mass - loss rate drops .",
    "recent radiation - driven wind models of oba supergiants show that stars change their wind characteristics at spectral types b1 and a0 , where  jumps upwards by factors of five , due to fe recombinations . in this poster",

    "our method is outlined in the poster by de koter & vink ( these proceedings ) .",

    "typical lbv results are shown in the first figure , for three values of .",
    "it shows that there are ranges in @xmath1 where  is predicted to increase , and ranges where  decreases .",
    "the decreases are due to a growing mismatch between the positions of the driving lines ( mostly in the uv ) and the location of the flux maximum which shifts towards the optical for cooler stars .",
    "the increases are due to recombinations of feiv to feiii , and feiii to feii .",
    "uv observations have shown that these `` bi - stability '' jumps occur at spectral types b1 and a0 ( lamers et al .",
    "the second figure shows a comparison between our models ( dotted line ) and the h@xmath2 mass loss rates for agcar ( stahl et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it shows that the observed and predicted mass loss agree within 0.1 dex .",
    "note that we have applied a corrective shift of @xmath3 k to our predictions to account for an inaccurate calculation of the ionisation balance of fe .",

    "it shows that the mass - loss variability of agcar is due to changes in the ionisation balance of iron .",
    "the predicted mass - loss rates are not only a function of , but also of mass .",
    "this sensitivity of  to mass offers the opportunity to constrain lbv masses . comparing the ag car data with  predictions for different masses results in a best fit to the present - day mass of 35  for agcar .",
