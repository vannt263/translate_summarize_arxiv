    "the first stars in the universe mark the end of the cosmic dark ages , reionize the universe , and provide the enriched gas required for later stellar generations",
    ". they may also be important as precursors to black holes that coalesce and power bright early quasars .",
    "the first stars are thought to form inside dark matter halos of mass @xmath3@xmath4 at redshifts @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these halos consist of 85% dark matter and 15% baryons in the form of metal - free hydrogen and helium gas .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that the baryonic matter cools and collapses via molecular hydrogen cooling @xcite into a single small protostar @xcite at the center of the halo ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we continue our previous work @xcite examining the effect of dark matter ( dm)the particles on the first stars .",
    "we focus on weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which are the favorite dark matter candidate of many physicists because they automatically provide approximately the right amount of dark matter , i.e. 24% of the current energy density of the universe .",
    "many wimp candidates are their own antiparticles , in which case they can annihilate with themselves in the early universe with weak interaction cross sections , leaving behind this relic density .",
    "probably the best example of a wimp is the neutralino , which in many models is the lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "the neutralino , the supersymmetric partner of the w , z , and higgs bosons , has the required weak interaction cross section and mass @xmath6 gev - tev to give the correct amount of dark matter and would play an important role in the first stars . for reviews of susy and",
    "other dark matter candidates see @xcite .",
    "this same annihilation process is the basis of the work we consider here .",
    "wimp self - annihilation is relevant wherever the wimp density is sufficiently high .",
    "such regimes include the early universe , in galactic halos today @xcite , in the sun @xcite and earth @xcite , and in the first stars . as our canonical values",
    ", we will use the standard value for the annihilation cross section @xmath7 as this gives the right wimp relic density today , as well as take @xmath8 for our canonical value of the wimp particle mass , but will also consider a broader range of wimp masses ( 1 gev10 tev ) and cross - section .    the interaction strengths and masses of the neutralino depend on a large number of model parameters . in the minimal supergravity model ,",
    "experimental and observational bounds restrict @xmath9 to 50 gev2 tev , while @xmath10 lies within an order of magnitude of @xmath11 ( except at the low end of the mass range where it could be several orders of magnitude smaller ) @xcite .",
    "nonthermal particles can have annihilation cross - sections that are many orders of magnitude larger ( e.g.  @xcite ) and would have even more drastic effects .",
    "given the present state of the field there are many types of dm candidates which could apply  @xcite ; the effects we find apply equally well to other wimp candidates with comparable cross sections for self - annihilation and scattering off of nucleons .    in this paper",
    "we consider the effects of wimp annihilation on the first stars . in a previous paper ( hereafter ,",
    "paper i ) @xcite two of us ( together with p. gondolo ) considered the effects of dark matter annihilation on the formation of the first stars .",
    "we found that a crucial transition takes place when the gas number density of the collapsing protostar exceeds a critical value ( @xmath12 for a 100 gev wimp mass ) : at this point wimp annihilation heating dominates over all cooling mechanisms and prevents the further collapse of the star .",
    "we suggested that the very first stellar objects might be `` dark stars , '' a new phase of stellar evolution in which the dm  while only supplying 1% of the mass density  provides the power source for the star through dm annihilation .",
    "we are as yet uncertain of the lifetime of these theoretical objects .",
    "once the dm contained inside the star runs out , the star could contract and heat up to the point where fusion becomes possible .",
    "however , as the star reaches nuclear density , there is an additional mechanism for repopulating the dm inside the star : capture of more dm from the ambient medium .",
    "this new source of dm can extend the lifetime of the dark star .",
    "indeed the capture process can continue as long as there is enough ambient dm passing through the star , causing dm annihilation inside the star to continue , possibly even to today .",
    "dark stars , powered by dm annihilation , require three key ingredients , as shown in paper i : 1 ) high dark matter density , 2 ) annihilation products remain trapped in the star , and 3 ) dm heating dominates over the other sources of heating .",
    "the first stars exist at the right place and at the right time to have the best chance of achieving the first criterion : they exist in the high density centers of dark matter haloes , and they form at high redshifts ( density scales as @xmath13 ) .",
    "these densities are still not enough : paper i showed that the dm density must be driven up still further in order for the dm heating to become important : as the baryons condense to form stars , they come to dominate the potential well and pull the dm in with them and drive up the density .",
    "the resultant dm densities were computed in paper i by adiabatic contraction . once the dm due to this effect runs out , the dark star phase might end .",
    "on the other hand , there is another effect that can repopulate the dm inside the stars and allow the dark star phase to continue : capture of more dm from the ambient medium .",
    "to get a significant amount of captured material into the star requires the enhanced densities due to adiabatic contraction . we will estimate the required ambient dm density for capture to be important , and find that it is somewhat lower than is required in the earlier protostellar phase .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the effects of dm annihilation on early zero - metallicity ( population iii ) stars , once they do have fusion inside their cores .",
    "these stars live inside a reservoir of wimps ; as the wimps move through the stars , some of the wimps are captured by the stars . the captured dm sinks to the center of the stars , where the dm can annihilate very efficiently .",
    "this has the effect of dramatically increasing the annihilation rate inside of a star , compared to dm annihilation without scattering .",
    "the annihilation provides a heat source for the stars , and we compare this dm annihilation luminosity to the fusion luminosity of the stars , as well as to the eddington luminosity .",
    "of course , the presence of dm ( with high densities due to adiabatic contraction or capture ) would already become important during ( and seriously affect ) the formation and earlier stages of these stars .",
    "here it is simply our intent to show that under some circumstances dm capture makes the importance of dm heating in pop .",
    "iii stars unavoidable . thus , even if dm annihilation fails to stop a pop .",
    "iii star from forming ( as was considered in @xcite ) , a dark star powered by dm annihilation may exist at the high nuclear densities where fusion can take place .",
    "again , we wish to note that the dm supplies less than a percent of the mass of the dark star and yet may be responsible for its luminosity .",
    "the two key uncertainties in this work are : ( i ) the scattering cross section must be at ( or near ) the experimental limit , and ( ii ) the ambient dm density must be high enough for capture to take place . whereas the annihilation cross section is fixed to be close to eq.([eq : anncrossection ] ) , on theoretical grounds the scattering cross section can vary across many orders of magnitude . as discussed later ,",
    "it is , however , constrained by experimental bounds . for scattering to matter in the first stars ,",
    "the scattering cross section must be within two orders of magnitude of the current experimental limits .",
    "such a cross section should be experimentally accessible in the next round of dm detection experiments .",
    "the second criterion is likely to be true for a while after the star is created , but it is not clear for how long .",
    "once the halo containing the dark star merges with other objects , it is not clear how long the central dm in the halo remains undisturbed , and it is not clear how long the dark star remains at this central point . in principle the capture could continue indefinitely so that a dark star could still exist today , but this is very unclear .",
    "previous work on dm annihilation powering stars has also been done in the context of high dm densities near the supermassive black holes in galactic centers , e.g. wimp burners @xcite and more generally @xcite .    just as we were preparing to submit our paper , a very similar work was submitted by  @xcite .",
    "we have carried the analysis further .",
    "we agree with  @xcite in the conclusion that dm annihilation may dominate over fusion , and we illustrate the dm densities required for this conclusion .",
    "in addition , we go one step further and discuss the possibility that the dm power source may exceed the eddington luminosity and prevent the first stars from growing beyond a limited mass .",
    "this would effect the ir background , the re - ionization of the universe , the number of supernova , and potentially the nature of supernova of the first stars ; this will be addressed in a separate publication  @xcite .",
    "we begin by discussing the equilibrium wimp abundance in the first stars , by computing the number of wimps captured by the first stars , and equating this with the annihilation rate of wimps in the first stars .",
    "a discussion of adiabatic contraction , which may drive up the dm density near the baryons , follows .",
    "then we compute the dm annihilation luminosity and compare with fusion luminosity .",
    "finally , we compare the dm luminosity with the eddington luminosity and find a maximum stellar mass as a function of dm density .",
    "as wimps travel through a star , they can scatter off of the nuclei in the star with the scattering cross section @xmath14 .",
    "although most of the wimps travel right through the star , some of them lose enough energy to be captured .",
    "we call the capture rate @xmath15 .",
    "the wimps then sink to the center of the star , where they can annihilate with one another with the annihilation rate @xmath16 .",
    "this process was previously noticed as important for the sun by @xcite and in the earth by @xcite .",
    "dm could be detected through neutrinos produced from the dm annihilation products in the sun or earth with experiments such as superkamiokande @xcite and amanda ( which did not find a signal and placed bounds ) and icecube ( which is starting to take data)@xcite .",
    "other indirect searches such as glast and pamela could detect the gamma - ray and positron annihilation products respectively from dm annihilating in the milky way halo ( the gamma - rays and positrons from dm annihilating in the sun or earth would be trapped inside the objects and would not make it to our detectors ) .",
    "the number of wimps @xmath17 in the star is then determined by a competition between capture and annihilation via the differential equation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the annihilation rate ( and the factor of two appears because two particles are annihilated in each event ) , and @xmath20 is defined as an @xmath21independent annihilation coefficient . solving this equation , we find @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the equilibration timescale .",
    "equilibrium corresponds to a balance between the capture and annihilation rates , i.e. @xmath24 as we will show , for the case of pop iii stars , equilibrium is quickly reached ( @xmath25 ) and we may use eq.([eq : inequil ] ) .",
    "the annihilation rate @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the density of captured dm at a point @xmath28 inside of the star . in this section",
    "we will show that the wimps quickly thermalize with the core of the star , so that we can treat the dm density distribution as isothermal , and then we will compute the annihilation rate .",
    "our work closely follows the approach previously given by @xcite .",
    "first let us examine the wimp thermalization timescale inside the star .",
    "the amount of energy @xmath29 lost by a wimp in a scattering event with a nucleus ( proton mass @xmath30 ) in the star ranges from @xmath31 ^ 2}$ ] . assuming a flat distribution and taking @xmath32 , the average energy loss is @xmath33 .",
    "roughly , thermalization requires @xmath34 ; i.e. there must be @xmath35 scatters .",
    "thus , for @xmath36 gev , the timescale for thermalization can be estimated as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the escape velocity of a dm particle from the surface of the star , and @xmath39 is the average density of the star . for a hundred gev wimp ,",
    "@xmath40 , and @xmath41 , we find that the thermalization time scale to be very short , roughly three months .",
    "thus we can use an isothermal distribution for the dm , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the central number density of dm and @xmath44 is the central temperature of the star , @xmath45 is the gravitational potential at radius @xmath28 with respect to the center , and @xmath46 is the mass interior to @xmath28 .",
    "one can define effective volumes @xmath47 upon integration this gives @xmath48^{3/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the planck mass , and @xmath50 is the core mass density of the star .",
    "the name `` effective volume '' is suggestive since we have @xmath51 and also the total annihilation rate is given as @xmath52 .",
    "one can then solve eq.([eq : anntwo ] ) to find the n - independent annihilation coefficient defined in eq.([eq : independent ] ) , @xmath53    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the wimp luminosity is given in table iii for a variety of stellar masses together with the ordinary fusion - powered stellar luminosity @xmath54 provided by the models of @xcite for these stars .",
    "roughly , using eq.([eq : rough ] ) we may write @xmath55    the wimp luminosity depends linearly on the the wimp density passing through the stars .",
    "we have also computed the wimp energy density @xmath56 that is required in order for the wimp annihilation energy to equal the ordinary stellar luminosity , which will dramatically alter the properties of the first stars  @xcite .",
    "we stress that the dm densities listed here are those in the ambient medium ( nfw plus adiabatic contraction ) rather than the densities after capture ; it is this ambient density that determines the capture rate , and also therefore the the annihilation rate ( in equilibrium ) , and consequently the luminosity . for any wimp densities higher than this value",
    ", the star s luminosity is dominated by annihilation energy ( rather than by ordinary fusion ) .",
    "we note that the luminosity due to fusion in the zero - metallicity stars @xcite scales as @xmath57 ( see figure 1 ) whereas @xmath58 , so that dm heating is relatively more important in lower - mass stars .",
    "the dm luminosity is dominant for the values of @xmath56 given in the last column of table iii , and is dominant for all relevant stellar masses for @xmath59gev/@xmath60 ; thus for dark matter densities in excess of this value , it will be the dm heating that determines stellar properties , and the star is a dark star .",
    "the two luminosities are plotted in figure 1 where they can be compared with one another .",
    "if the first stars are observed ( e.g. , by james webb space telescope ) to have the properties predicted of fusion - driven stars , then one could use these results to constrain wimp properties to make sure that dm annihilation remains subdominant .",
    "a potentially important consideration is the time for which a dark star will be able to burn dm at the calculated rate , given that it will annihilate its captured store of dm in a time of order @xmath61 as given by eq.([eq : equiltime ] ) .",
    "the maximal burning time is determined by the total mass of dm in the region of phase space that intersects the star .",
    "this mass could be small if the star were fixed exactly at the central cusp of the dm halo .",
    "however , we expect that given the complexities of the collapse process , the star will have some nonzero velocity and thus ` wander ' through a region of some radius significantly larger than that of the star .",
    "this makes much more dm mass available for burning , at the expense of somewhat lower average dm density .",
    "( it should then be noted that the fiducial dm density numbers we assume are not those expected in the innermost core but over some significantly larger region . )",
    "estimation of the expected degree of wandering , the detailed dm density profile , and therefore the maximal burning time of the dark stars will be left for future and more detailed study .     and",
    "@xmath62 ( squares are from the third column of table 3 . )",
    "if we keep the cross section fixed , the middle dot - dashed line corresponds to a dm density of @xmath63 , and the top diamond line would have a dm density of @xmath64 ; in this final case , the dm luminosity would dominate over the eddington luminosity for a star with a mass of @xmath65 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we as yet know little about the effect that significant dark matter heating would have on the structure of zero - metallicity stars , but we can nonetheless place an approximate upper bound on the stars mass if we assume that they must be sub - eddington . in the current paper , we simply take the zams stars , add the dm luminosity , and ask whether or not the resulting dark stars are self - consistent . in other words , is it possible for dark stars of this mass to exist ? we compute the eddington luminosity @xmath66 for these objects , and ascertain whether or not the dm luminosity is in excess of this value . if @xmath67 , then the star of this mass can not exist : the pressure from the star would be so large as to blow off some of the mass .",
    "in reality one should do a different problem : one should really follow the protostars and compute their structure as they accrete mass on their way to becoming zamss .",
    "such a calculation would essentially compare accretion luminosity ( the value of which would depend on the nature of the accretion , e.g. spherical or disk accretion ) to the eddington luminosity ; here we are comparing dark star luminosity to the eddington luminosity .",
    "the eddington luminosity is defined ( e.g.  @xcite ) to be @xmath68 where @xmath69 is newton s constant , @xmath70 is the speed of light , @xmath71 is the mass of the star , and @xmath72 is the opacity of stellar atmosphere . since the first stars stellar atmospheres are hot and nearly metal - free , the opacity is dominated by thompson scattering , so we take @xmath73    in figure 1 , we have plotted three luminosities as a function of stellar mass for zero metallicity stars : the luminosity due to fusion , the luminosity due to wimp annihilation ( for a variety of wimp densities in the star ) , and the eddington luminosity . since the eddington luminosity scales as @xmath74 whereas the dm luminosity scales as @xmath75 , for a large enough dark matter density the two curves will cross for some stellar mass .",
    "the lightest stellar mass for which @xmath67 then constitutes an approximate upper mass limit to the first stars , because the star of that mass is unable to accrete any further due to the radiation pressure from the wimp annihilation .",
    "if one assumes that accretion efficiently drives up the mass of any pop iii star , then the mass of the first star will be uniquely determined by the properties of the dm . using eqs.([eq - ldm ] ) and ( [ eq - ledd ] )",
    ", we get : @xmath76    for example , we find that for a dark matter density of @xmath77 gev/@xmath60 , the first stars can not be more massive than @xmath78 .",
    "figure 2 illustrates @xmath79 as a function of wimp energy density for several values of the scattering cross section .     for a fixed cross section .",
    "the different lines correspond to different spin - dependent cross sections : @xmath62 ( solid line ) , @xmath80 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath81 ( dashed line ) . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in principle , these arguments can be turned around to place a bound on the scattering cross section .",
    "figure 3 is a plot of wimp scattering cross section vs. wimp mass .",
    "experimental bounds are shown .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate the values of @xmath82 that correspond to different values of @xmath83 at which a 1 @xmath84 star is eddington limited by dm annihilation .",
    "( the scaling to other stellar masses is straightforward since @xmath85 . )",
    "once the mass of the first stars is determined , then one could rule out any combination of @xmath82 and @xmath83 for a given wimp mass that would preclude stars of such a mass from forming . as an extreme example , if one were to believe adiabatic contraction all the way to the limit where the protostellar core has gas density @xmath86 , the wimp density would reach @xmath87 . in this case",
    "the eddington limit would be reached for masses @xmath88 for our fiducial scattering cross section .",
    "if , instead , the first stars are observed to form with masses larger than one solar mass , and such an enormous wimp density were found to be sensible , one could place a bound of @xmath89 on wimps for almost any mass ( the equilibrium dm luminosity is independent of @xmath9 ) , which would be the tightest known bound on the spin dependent scattering cross section by several orders of magnitude ; see figure 3 . in this extreme case",
    "we could also put interesting limits on spin independent scattering ; see figure 4",
    ".    obtaining bounds on the wimp parameters in this way depends on detailed understanding of the ambient wimp density within which the dark star resides .",
    "clearly this is a very difficult problem which will not be solved in the near future .",
    "indeed , it is likely that the @xmath90 haloes containing the dark stars will merge with other haloes and that the stars will not remain forever in regions of high dm density .",
    "however , simulations of structure formation are becoming ever better and one may hope someday to address this question .",
    "the three horizonal lines are bounds that would result from the discovery of pop iii stars of @xmath91 for a variety of dm densities inside these stars ( due to the fact that dm annihilation pressure would otherwise prevent their formation ) . the lines are labeled as follows : ds i corresponds to ambient density @xmath92 and would lead to the bound @xmath93 ; ds ii corresponds to @xmath94 and would lead to @xmath95 ; and ds iii corresponds to @xmath96 and would lead to @xmath97 .",

    "iii stars are expected to reside at the core of a @xmath98 dark matter halo .",
    "previously two of us @xcite discussed the importance of dark matter annihilation in the first stars , proposing the existence of `` dark stars '' powered by dm heating .",
    "even once the dm initially collapsing with the baryons into the star runs out as a source of fuel , it can be replenished by capture of more dm from the ambient medium ( as the dm passes through the dark star ) . in this paper , we have estimated the rates of wimp capture and self - annihilation in such stars .",
    "we have shown that when these rates are in equilibrium , the accompanying heating would provide an energy source that can rival nuclear fusion and prolong the dark star phase , if the core dark matter density is sufficiently high .",
    "such densities seem plausible based on analytic models of adiabatically contracted halos @xcite , suggesting that dm heating may radically affect the structure of the first stars .",
