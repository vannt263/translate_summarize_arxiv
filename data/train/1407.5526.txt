    "spin - glass problems @xcite continue to fascinate with new orderings and phase diagrams under frustration @xcite and ground - state entropy @xcite .",
    "the extension of these models from the extensively studied ising spin models to less simple spins offer the possibility of completely new orderings and phase diagrams .",
    "we find that odd @xmath0-state clock models are such cases",
    ". spins in odd @xmath0-state clock models can not be exactly anti - aligned with each other .",
    "furthermore , for a given spin , its interacting neighbor has two states that give the maximally misaligned pair configuration .",
    "this fact immediately injects ground - state entropy in the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions , even without the frozen randomness of interactions of the spin - glass system .",
    "we have calculated , from renormalization - group theory , the phase diagrams of arbitrary odd @xmath0-state clock spin - glass models in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "we find that these models have asymmetric phase diagrams , as is also the case for quantum heisenberg spin - glass models @xcite .",
    "they exhibit no finite - temperature spin - glass phase . for all odd @xmath2 ,",
    "algebraically ordered antiferromagnetic phases occur .",
    "one such phase is dominant and occurs for all @xmath2 .",
    "other such phases occupy a small low - temperature portion of the phase diagram and occur for @xmath5 .",
    "all algebraically ordered phases have the same structure , determined by an attractive finite - temperature sink fixed point where a dominant and a subdominant pair states have the only non - zero boltzmann weights .",
    "the phase transition critical exponents come from distinct critical fixed points , but quickly saturate to the high @xmath0 value .",
    "thus , a rich phase transition structure is seen for odd @xmath0-state spin - glass models on a @xmath1 hierarchical lattice .",
    "the @xmath0-state clock models are composed of unit spins that are confined to a plane and that can only point along @xmath0 angularly equidistant directions . accordingly",
    ", the @xmath0-state clock spin - glass model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 , at site @xmath9 the spin angle @xmath10 takes on the values @xmath11 with @xmath12 , and @xmath13 denotes that the sum runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites .",
    "the bond strengths @xmath14 are @xmath15 ( ferromagnetic ) with probability @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( antiferromagnetic ) with probability @xmath18 .",
    "this model becomes the ising model for q=2 and the xy model for @xmath19 .",
    "cubic lattice with the length - rescaling factor of @xmath20 .",
    "bond - moving is followed by decimation .",
    "( b ) exact renormalization - group transformation for the equivalent @xmath1 hierarchical lattice with the length - rescaling factor of @xmath20 .",
    "( c ) pairwise applications of the quenched probability convolution of eq.(5 ) , leading to the exact transformation in ( b ) . ]    the @xmath0-state clock spin - glass model , in @xmath1 dimensions , is readily solved by a renormalization - group method that is approximate on the cubic lattice @xcite and simultaneously exact on the hierarchical lattice @xcite .",
    "hierarchical lattices have been used to study a variety of spin - glass and other statistical mechanics problems.@xcite under rescaling , for @xmath21 , the form of the interaction as given in the rightmost side of eq.(1 ) is not conserved and one must therefore express the hamiltonian more generally , as @xmath22 the energy @xmath23 depends on the absolute value of the angle difference , @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the renormalization - group flows are the flows of @xmath25 interaction constants for even @xmath0 and the flows of @xmath26 interaction constants for odd @xmath0 . with no loss of generality ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath23 is set to zero .",
    "the renormalization - group transformation , for spatial dimensions @xmath1 and length rescaling factor @xmath27 ( necessary for treating the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations on equal footing ) , is achieved by a sequence of bond moving @xmath28 and decimation @xmath29 where the constants @xmath30 are fixed by the requirement that the maximum value of @xmath23 is zero .",
    "the starting bimodal quenched probability distribution of the interactions , characterized by @xmath18 and described above , is also not conserved under rescaling .",
    "the renormalized quenched probability distribution of the interactions is obtained by the convolution @xcite @xmath31 }           \\delta(v'(\\theta_{i'j'})-r(\\left\\{v(\\theta_{ij})\\right\\})),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 represents the bond moving and decimation given in eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) . for numerical practicality ,",
    "the bond moving and decimation of eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) are achieved by a sequence of pairwise combination of interactions , as shown in fig.1(c ) , each pairwise combination leading to an intermediate probability distribution resulting from a pairwise convolution as in eq.(5 ) .",
    "we effect this procedure numerically , by generating 5,000 interactions that embody the quenched probability distribution resulting from each pairwise combination . due to the large number of phase diagrams ( figs . 2 and 3 ) , a single realization of quenched randomness is used .",
    "each of the generated 5,000 interactions is determined by @xmath26 interaction constants . at each pairwise convolution as in eq.(5 ) , 5,000 randomly chosen pairs are matched by eq.(3 ) or ( 4 ) , and a new set of 5,000 is produced .",
    "the different thermodynamic phases of the model are identified by the different asymptotic renormalization - group flows of the quenched probability distributions . for all renormalization - group flows , inside the phases and on the phase boundaries , eq.(5 )",
    "is iterated until asymptotic behavior is reached .",
    "thus , we are able to calculate phase diagrams for any number of clock states @xmath0 . similar previous studies , on other spin - glass systems , are in refs . @xcite .    in a previous study @xcite , using the above method , we have considered even values of @xmath0 . in this study",
    ", we consider odd values of @xmath0 and calculate the phase diagrams , which are not symmetric around @xmath33 .",
    "for @xmath0 odd , the system does not have sublattice spin - reversal @xmath34 symmetry , which leads to the asymmetric phase diagrams .",
    "we obtain qualitatively new features in the phase diagrams for odd @xmath0 .",
    "these features do not occur for even @xmath0 .",
    "our calculated phase diagrams for the odd @xmath36-state clock spin - glass models are shown in fig .",
    "2 . the lower temperature details of the phase diagrams are given in fig .",
    "all phase boundaries are second order .",
    "the phase diagrams of the odd @xmath0-state clock spin - glass models are quite different from the even @xmath0 phase diagrams @xcite : the odd @xmath0 phase diagrams do not have ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic symmetry , _ i.e. _ , they are not left - right symmetric with respect to the @xmath37 line .",
    "the odd @xmath0 phase diagrams do not have a spin - glass phase , which is consistent with previous results @xcite that the xy model , corresponding to the @xmath19 limit of the @xmath0-state clock models , does not have a spin - glass phase on @xmath1 hierarchical lattices .",
    "the odd @xmath0 phase diagrams show a multiplicity of algebraically ordered phases ( and one conventionally ordered phase ) on the antiferromagnetic side .",
    "all points in an algebraically ordered phase flow , under renormalization group , to a single stable fixed point ( sink ) that occurs at non - zero , non - infinite temperature .",
    "convergence to this stable critical fixed occurs , to 6 significant figures , within 5 renormalization - group transformations .",
    "further convergence is obtained for more renormalization - group transformations . as seen in fig .",
    "4 , at each renormalization - group transformation , the quenched probability distribution of interactions changes from the initial ( 1-p ) and p double - delta function , to eventually reach the critical sink described below .",
    "because of this flow structure , the correlation length is infinite and the correlation function decays as an inverse power of distance ( as opposed to exponentially ) at all points in such an algebraically ordered phase .",
    "such algebraically ordered phases were previously seen by berker and kadanoff @xcite for antiferromagnetic potts models and have since been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the correlation function decay critical exponent has the same value for all points in such a phase , since the renormalization - group flows are to single fixed point , in contrast to the continuously varying critical exponents in the algebraically ordered phase of the @xmath38 xy model , where the flows are to a fixed line.@xcite    the phase diagrams show true reentrance @xcite ( disordered - ordered - disordered ) as temperature is lowered at fixed antiferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath18 , on both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic sides of the phase diagram .",
    "the phase diagrams also show lateral , true double reentrance ( ferromagnetic - disordered - ferromagnetic - disordered ) as the antiferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath18 is increased at fixed temperature , only on the ferromagnetic side .",
    "multiple reentrances have previously been seen in liquid crystal systems.@xcite    no antiferromagnetic ordering occurs for the lowest model , @xmath39 .",
    "algebracially ordered antiferromagnetic phases occur for all higher @xmath40 models . in these cases ,",
    "the phase boundary between the dominant antiferromagnetic algebraically ordered phase and the disordered phase is slightly asymmetric with the phase boundary between the ferromagnetic phase and the disordered phase . to make this slight asymmetry evident ,",
    "the latter boundary is also shown ( dashed ) in fig .",
    "2 reflected about the @xmath37 line . the phase diagram for the xy model limit , namely odd @xmath19 ,",
    "is also shown in fig .",
    "2 , calculated here with @xmath41 clock states . in this limit , the distinction between odd and even @xmath0 disappears .",
    "this suggests that the zero - temperature spin - glass phase @xcite found for even @xmath19 @xcite also occurs for odd @xmath19 .",
