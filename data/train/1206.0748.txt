    "circumstellar matter ( csm ) around supernova ( sn ) progenitors may play an important role in the emission and propagation of energy from sn explosions .",
    "the interaction of the sn radiation with optically thin csm shells may generate emission lines , with widths that are representative of the shell velocity ( i.e. , type - iin sne ; schlegel 1990 ; kiewe et al .",
    "the interaction of sn ejecta with the csm can power the light curves of sne by transformation of the sn kinetic energy into photons . in cases where considerable amounts of optically thin ( and ionized ) material is present around the exploding star , synchrotron and free - free radiation can emerge , and inverse compton scattering can generate x - ray photons ( e.g. , chevalier & fransson 1994 ; horesh et al .",
    "2012 ; krauss et al .",
    "2012 ) .    for the type - iin sn ptf09uj , ofek et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggested that a shock breakout can take place in optically - thick wind ( see also grassberg , imshennik , & nadyozhin 1971 ; falk & arnett 1977 ; chevalier & irwin 2011 ; balberg & loeb 2011 ) .",
    "this will happen if the thomson optical depth within the wind profile is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the speed of light , and @xmath3 is the shock speed .",
    "ofek et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that shock breakout in wind environments produces optical displays that are brighter and have longer time scales than those from surfaces of red supergiants ( e.g. , colgate 1974 ; matzner & mckee 1999 ; nakar & sari 2010 ; rabinak & waxman 2011 ; couch et al .",
    "chevalier & irwin ( 2011 ) extended this picture .",
    "specifically , they discussed csm with a wind profile in which the wind has a cutoff at a distance @xmath4 .",
    "if the optical depth at @xmath4 is @xmath5 then the light curve of the supernova will have a slow decay ( e.g. , sn2006gy ; ofek et al .",
    "2007 ; smith et al .  2007 ) .",
    "if the optical depth at @xmath4 is @xmath6 , then it will have a faster decay ( e.g. , sn2010gx ; pastorello et al .",
    "2010a ; quimby et al .",
    "moriya & tominaga ( 2012 ) investigated shock breakouts in general wind density profiles of the form @xmath7 . they suggested that , depending on the power - law index @xmath8 , shock breakouts in wind environments can produce bright sne without narrow emission lines ( e.g. , sn2008es ; gezari et al .",
    "2009 ; miller et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "recently katz et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and murase et al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed that if the progenitor is surrounded by optically thick csm then a collisionless shock is necessarily formed during the shock breakout .",
    "moreover , they argued that the energy emitted from the collisionless shock in the form of high - energy photons and particles is comparable to the shock breakout energy .",
    "furthermore , this process may generate high - energy ( @xmath9tev ) neutrinos .",
    "although katz et al .  ( 2011 ) predicted that the photons are generated with energy typically above 60kev , it is reasonable to assume that some photons will be emitted with lower energy .",
    "chevalier & irwin ( 2012 ) showed that comptonization and inverse compton of the high - energy photons is likely to play an important role , and that the high - energy photons will be absorbed .",
    "svirski , nakar & sari ( 2012 ) discuss the x - ray emission from collisionless shocks .",
    "they show that at early times the x - rays will be processed into the optical regime by the compton process .",
    "therefore , at early times , the optical emission will be about @xmath10 times stronger than the high - energy emission . with time",
    ", the x - ray emission will become stronger , while the optical emission will decay .",
    "they conclude that for a csm with a steady wind profile ( @xmath11 ) , x - ray emission may peak only at late times , roughly 1050 times the shock breakout time scale .",
    "the shock breakout time scale , @xmath12 , is roughly given by the diffusion time scale at the time of shock breakout .",
    "this time scale is also equivalent to the radius at which the shock breaks out ( @xmath13 ) divided by the shock velocity ( @xmath14 ; weaver 1976 ) .",
    "if the main source of optical photons is due to diffusion of the shock breakout energy , the sn optical light rise time , @xmath15 , will be equivalent to the shock breakout time scale .",
    "therefore , x - ray flux measurements and spectra of sne embedded in dense csm starting from the explosion until months or years after maximum light are able to measure the properties of the csm around the sn progenitors and the progenitor mass - loss history .",
    "this unique probe into the final stages of massive star evolution has been only partially exploited , at best .",
    "herein , we analyze the x - ray data for 28 sne with light curves that may be powered by a shock breakout from dense csm , and for which _",
    "swift_-xrt ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) observations exist .",
    "we use this sample to search for x - ray signatures of collisionless shocks  emission at late times ( months to years after peak optical luminosity ) .",
    "we suggest that these signals were observed in several cases , most notably in sn2006jc ( immler et al .",
    "2008 ) and sn2010jl ( chandra et al .",
    "2012a ) . finally , we review the conditions for a shock breakout in csm with a wind profile and discuss , the importance of bound - free absorption and the possibility to detect radio emission from such sne .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : sample ] we present the sn sample , while  [ sec : obs ] presents the x - ray observations .",
    "we review and discuss the model in  [ sec : disc ] , and discuss the observations in context of the model in ",
    "[ sec : obsmoel ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in  [ conc ] .",
    "our sample of sne is based on sne found by amateur astronomers , and several surveys , including the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ; li et al .",
    "2000 ) , the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; drake et al .  2009a ) , pan - starrs1 ( ps1 ; kaiser et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; law et al .  2009 ; rau et al .",
    "two sne , ptf09drs and ptf10tel , are reported here for the first time .",
    "we note that many of the nearby or luminous sne found by ptf are also observed by _",
    "swift_.    we selected a sample of sne in which the main source of energy may be explained by diffusion of the explosion shock energy through optically thick csm around the progenitor .",
    "first , we include type - iin sne within 200mpc .",
    "sne that belong to this class show narrow hydrogen emission lines .",
    "this is an indication of the presence of optically thin material somewhere around the progenitor .",
    "however , it is unlikely that _ all _ sne showing narrow hydrogen emission lines in their spectra are powered mainly by the diffusion of shock energy in an optically thick environment .",
    "one reason is that some type - iin sne show x - ray emission near maximum optical light , which is not expected when optically thick csm is present ( see  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "furthermore , moriya & tominaga ( 2012 ) suggested that not all sne powered by interaction of the ejecta with slow - moving material will necessarily have narrow emission lines in their spectrum .",
    "we note that some of the type - iin sne in our sample are peculiar ( e.g. ,",
    "sn2010jp / ptf10aaxi ; smith et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "another relevant , but rare , class of objects are type - ibn sne .",
    "this class is defined by the lack of hydrogen lines and presence of narrow helium emission lines .",
    "the only sn of this type in our sample is sn2006jc ( nakano et al .",
    "2006 ; foley et al .  2007 ;",
    "pastorello et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the third class of sne we investigate here is the small group of hydrogen - poor super - luminous sn ( slsn - i ; see review in gal - yam et al .",
    "quimby et al .",
    "( 2011a ) used the spectra of several such events found by ptf , at intermediate redshift ( @xmath16 ) , to show that these events , as well as scp06f6 ( barbary et al .",
    "2009 ) , and sn2005ap ( quimby et al .",
    "2007 ) are spectroscopically similar .",
    "this group of sne continues to grow with new discoveries ( e.g. , chomiuk et al .",
    "2011 ; leloudas et al .",
    "2012 ) , and their hosts were studied in neill et al .",
    "although the nature of these events is not understood ( e.g. , kasen & bildsten 2010 ) , quimby et al .  ( 2011a ) suggested that they may be powered by a pulsational pair - instability sn ( rakavy , shaviv , & zinamon 1967 ; woosley , blinnikov , & heger 2007 ) . according to this tentative model",
    ", the sn ejecta interacts with a dense shell of material , enriched with intermediate mass elements , that was ejected by the progenitor during previous explosions ( see also ginzburg & balberg 2012 ) .",
    "this model is tentatively supported by observations of sn2006 oz ( leloudas et al .  2012 ) that may show a dip in the light curve followed by re - brightening .",
    "moriya & maeda ( 2012 ) interpret the dip as an increase in the opacity due to ionization of the massive shell / csm as it interact with the ejecta .    our sample , presented in table  [ tab : samp ] , consists of eight slsn - i objects , 19 type - iin sne and a single type - ibn sn .",

    "moreover , in the cases where bound - free absorption is important ( e.g. , @xmath223kms@xmath71 ; chevalier & irwin 2012 ) , the spectral x - ray evolution as a function of time can be use to probe the column density above the shock at any given time , and deduce the density profile outside the shocked regions .",
    "we also argue that in some cases , if the csm has steep density profiles ( e.g. , sn2010jl ) , it may be possible to detect radio emission .",
    "finally , we note that katz et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and murase et al .",
    "( 2011 ) predict that the collisionless shocks will generate tev neutrinos .",
    "these particles will be able to escape when the collisionless shock begins .",
    "the detection of such neutrinos using ice - cube ( karle et al .",
    "2003 ) will be a powerful tool to test this theory and explore the physics of collisionless shocks .",

    "<S> the optical light curve of some supernovae ( sne ) may be powered by the outward diffusion of the energy deposited by the explosion shock ( so - called shock breakout ) in optically thick ( @xmath0 ) circumstellar matter ( csm ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was shown that the radiation - mediated and -dominated shock in an optically thick wind must transform into a collisionless shock and can produce hard x - rays . </S>",

    "<S> we report on a search , using _ </S>",
    "<S> swift_-xrt and _ chandra _ , for x - ray emission from 28 sne that belong to classes whose progenitors are suspected to be embedded in dense csm . </S>",
    "<S> our sample includes 19 type - iin sne , one type - ibn sn and eight hydrogen - poor super - luminous sne ( slsn - i ; sn2005ap like ) . </S>",
    "<S> two sne ( sn2006jc and sn2010jl ) have x - ray properties that are roughly consistent with the expectation for x - rays from a collisionless shock in optically thick csm . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we suggest that their optical light curves are powered by shock breakout in csm . </S>",
    "<S> we show that two other events ( sn2010al and sn2011ht ) were too x - ray bright during the sn maximum optical light to be explained by the shock breakout model . we conclude that the light curves of some , but not all , type - iin / ibn sne are powered by shock breakout in csm . for the rest of the sne in our sample , </S>",
    "<S> including all the slsn - i events , our x - ray limits are not deep enough and were typically obtained at too early times ( i.e. , near the sn maximum light ) to conclude about their nature . </S>",
    "<S> late time x - ray observations are required in order to further test if these sne are indeed embedded in dense csm . </S>",
    "<S> we review the conditions required for a shock breakout in a wind profile . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the time scale , relative to maximum light , for the sn to peak in x - rays is a probe of the column density and the density profile above the shock region . </S>",
    "<S> the optical light curves of sne , for which the x - ray emission peaks at late times , are likely powered by the diffusion of shock energy from a dense csm . </S>",
    "<S> we note that if the csm density profile falls faster than a constant - rate wind density profile , then x - rays may escape at earlier times than estimated for the wind profile case . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , if the csm have a region in which the density profile is very steep , relative to a steady wind density profile , or the csm is neutral , then the radio free - free absorption may be low enough , and radio emission may be detected . </S>"
