    "j. w. young , the editor of the book @xcite , wrote in his introduction : _ there are fashions in mathematics as well as in clothes ,  and in both domains they have a tendency to repeat themselves .",
    "_ during the last decade , `` hyperbolic plane geometry '' aroused much interest and was investigated vigorously by a considerable number of mathematicians .",
    "despite the large number of investigations , the number of hyperbolic trigonometric formulas that can be collected from them is fairly small , they can be written on a page of size b5 .",
    "this observation is very surprising if we compare it with the fact that already in 1889 , a very extensive and elegant treatise of spherical trigonometry was written by john casey @xcite . for this",
    ", the reason , probably , is that the discussion of a problem in hyperbolic geometry is less pleasant than in spherical one .    on the other hand , in the 19th century , excellent mathematician ",
    "cyrill vrs in hungary made a big step to solve this problem .",
    "he introduced a method for the measurement of distances and angles in the case that the considered points or lines , respectively , are not real .",
    "unfortunately , since he published his works mostly in hungarian or in esperanto , his method is not well - known to the mathematical community .    to fill this gap",
    ", we use the concept of distance extracted from his work and , translating the standard methods of euclidean plane geometry into the language of the hyperbolic plane , apply it for various configurations .",
    "we give a model independent construction for the famous problem of malfatti ( discussed in @xcite ) and give some interesting formulas connected with the geometry of hyperbolic triangles . by the notion of distance introduced by vrs",
    ", we obtain results in hyperbolic plane geometry which are not well - known .",
    "the length of this paper is very limited , hence some proofs will be omitted here .",
    "the interested reader can find these proofs in the unpublished source file @xcite .",
    "the points @xmath0 denote the vertices of a triangle .",
    "the lengths of the edges opposite to these vertices are @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the angles at @xmath0 are denoted by @xmath2 , respectively . if the triangle has a right angle , it is always at @xmath3 . the symbol @xmath4 denotes half of the area of the triangle ; more precisely , we have @xmath5 .    *",
    "* connections between the trigonometric and hyperbolic trigonometric functions : * @xmath6 * * law of sines : * @xmath7 * * law of cosines : * @xmath8 * * law of cosines on the angles : * @xmath9 * * the area of the triangle : * @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the height of the triangle corresponding to @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the signed lengths of the segments into which the foot point of the height divides the side @xmath15 . * * heron s formula : * @xmath16 * * formulas on lambert s quadrangle : * the vertices of the quadrangle are @xmath17 and the lengths of the edges are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the only angle which is not a right angle is @xmath20 .",
    "then , for the sides , we have : @xmath21 and @xmath22 moreover , for the angles , we have : @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "first we extract the concepts of the distance of real points following the method of the book of cyrill vrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "we extend the plane with two types of points , one of the type of the points at infinity and the other one the type of ideal points . in a projective model",
    "these are the boundary and external points of a model with respect to the embedding real projective plane .",
    "two parallel lines determine a point at infinity , and two ultraparallel lines an ideal point which is the pole of their common transversal .",
    "now the concept of the line can be extended ; a line is real if it has real points ( in this case it also has two points at infinity and the other points on it are ideal points being the poles of the real lines orthogonal to the mentioned one ) .",
    "the extended real line is a closed compact set with finite length .",
    "we also distinguish the line at infinity which contains precisely one point at infinity and the so - called ideal line which contains only ideal points . by definition",
    "the common lengths of these lines are @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a constant of the hyperbolic plane and @xmath27 is the imaginary unit . in this paper",
    "we assume that @xmath28 .",
    "two points on a line determine two segments @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the sum of the lengths of these segments is @xmath31 .",
    "we define the length of a segment as an element of the linearly ordered set @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the linearly ordered set of real numbers extracted with two new numbers with the `` real infinity '' @xmath34 and its additive inverse @xmath35 .",
    "the infinities can be considered as new `` numbers '' having the properties that either `` there is no real number greater than or equal to @xmath36 '' or `` there is no real number less than or equal to @xmath35 '' .",
    "we also introduce the following operational rules : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for real @xmath41 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath42 is not a group , the rule of associativity holds only for such expressions which contain at most two new objects .",
    "in fact , @xmath43 is a contradiction .",
    "we also require that the equality @xmath44 holds for every real number @xmath45 , and for brevity we introduce the respective notations @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we extract the usual definition of hyperbolic function based on the complex exponential function by the following formulas : @xmath48 we also assume that @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    assuming that the trigonometric formulas of hyperbolic triangles are also valid with ideal vertices the definition of the mentioned lengths of the complementary segments of a line are given .",
    "for instance , consider a triangle with two real vertices ( @xmath52 and @xmath3 ) and an ideal one ( @xmath13 ) , respectively .",
    "the lengths of the segments between @xmath3 and @xmath13 are @xmath45 and @xmath53 , the lengths of the segments between @xmath52 and @xmath13 are @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the lengths of that segment between @xmath3 and @xmath52 which contains only real points is @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "let the right angle be at the vertex @xmath3 and denote by @xmath56 the other real angle at @xmath52 .",
    "( see in fig . 1 . )        with respect to this triangle we have @xmath57 , and since @xmath13 is an ideal point , the parallel angle corresponding to the distance @xmath58 less than or equal to @xmath59 .",
    "hence @xmath60 implying that @xmath61 .",
    "hence @xmath45 is a complex number .",
    "if the polar of @xmath13 is @xmath62 , then it is the common perpendicular of the lines @xmath63 and @xmath29 .",
    "the quadrangle @xmath64 has three right angles .",
    "denote by @xmath65 the length of that segment @xmath66 which contains real points only .",
    "then we get @xmath67 meaning that @xmath68 similarly we have that @xmath69 implying that @xmath70 , hence @xmath53 is complex .",
    "now we have that @xmath71 using the formulas between the trigonometric and hyperbolic trigonometric functions we get that @xmath72 implying that @xmath73 so @xmath74 analogously we get also that @xmath75 here @xmath76 and @xmath77 are arbitrary integers . on the other hand , if @xmath78 then @xmath79 , and so @xmath80 meaning that @xmath81 .",
    "for the half length of the complete line we can choose an odd multiplier of the number @xmath82 .",
    "the most simple choosing is when we assume that @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus the lengths of the segments @xmath63 and @xmath85 can be defined as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "we now define all of the possible lengths of a segment on the basis of the type of the line that contains them .",
    "we can distinguish six subcases .",
    "the definitions of the respective cases can be found in table 1 .",
    "we abbreviate the words real , infinite and ideal by symbols @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "@xmath91 means a real ( positive ) distance of the corresponding usual real elements which are a real point or the real polar line of an ideal point , respectively .",
    "every box in the table contains two numbers which are the lengths of the two segments determined by the two points .",
    "for example , the distance of a real and an ideal point is a complex number .",
    "its real part is the distance of the real point to the polar of the ideal point with a sign .",
    "this sign is positive in the case when the polar line intersects the segment between the real and ideal points , and is negative otherwise .",
    "the imaginary part of the length is @xmath92 , implying that the sum of the lengths of two complementary segments of this projective line has total length @xmath93 .",
    "consider now a point at infinity .",
    "this point can also be considered as the limit of real points or limit of ideal points of this line . by definition",
    "the distance from a point at infinity of a real line to any other real or infinite point of this line is @xmath94 according to that it contains or not ideal points .",
    "if , for instance , @xmath13 is an infinite point and @xmath52 is a real one , then the segment @xmath29 contains only real points has length @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear that with respect to the segments on a real line the length - function is continuous .",

    "@xmath41 and @xmath45 are the given lines , @xmath97 is their intersection point , @xmath77 is the polar of @xmath98 and @xmath13 and @xmath52 are the poles of @xmath41 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the numbers @xmath99 and @xmath100 represent real distances , as can be seen on fig .",
    "2 , respectively .",
    "the general connection between the angles and distances is the following : _ every distance of a pair of points is the measure of the angle of their polars multiplied by @xmath27 .",
    "the domain of the angle can be chosen in such a way , that we are going through the segment by a moving point and look at the domain which is described by the moving polar of this point . _      with the above definition of the length of a segment the known formulas of hyperbolic trigonometry can be extracted to the formulas of general objects with real , infinite or ideal vertices .",
    "for example , we can prove the hyperbolic theorem of sines for right - angled triangles .",
    "it says that @xmath101 .",
    "we prove * first * those cases when all sides of the triangle lie on real lines , respectively .",
    "we assume that the right angle is at @xmath3 and that it is a real point because of our definition .    * if @xmath13 is an infinite point @xmath52 and @xmath3 are real ones then @xmath102 is indeterminable and we can consider that the equality is true .",
    "the relation @xmath103 is also true by our agreement .",
    "if @xmath104 are at infinity then @xmath105 and the equality holds , too .",
    "* in the case when @xmath106 are real points and @xmath13 is an ideal point , let the polar of @xmath13 be @xmath107 . then by definition @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the distance of @xmath52 and @xmath110",
    "; @xmath111 where @xmath91 is the length of the segment between the lines of the sides @xmath63 and @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath107 intersects @xmath63 and @xmath15 in the points @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , then @xmath114 is a quadrangle with three right angles and with the sides @xmath41 , @xmath115 , @xmath91 and @xmath109 ( see the left figure in fig .",
    "this implies that @xmath116 , as we stated . *",
    "if @xmath3 is a real point , @xmath13 is at infinity , and @xmath52 is an ideal point , then @xmath117 and the right - hand side @xmath118 is undeterminable .",
    "if we consider @xmath119 it is infinite by our agreement , and the statement is true , again .",
    "* very interesting is the last case when @xmath3 is a real point , @xmath13 and @xmath52 are ideal points , respectively , and the line @xmath29 is a real line ( see the right - hand side picture in fig .",
    "3 ) . then @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , thus @xmath123 and the theorem holds if and only if in the real pentagon @xmath124 with five right angles it holds that @xmath125 .",
    "but we have :    denote by @xmath126 the edge lengths of the successive sides of a pentagon with five right angles on the hyperbolic plane .",
    "then we have : @xmath127 @xmath128 .",
    "* second * we assume that the hypotenuse @xmath29 lies on a non - real line .",
    "now if it is at infinity and at least one vertex is an infinite point then the statement evidently true .",
    "assume that @xmath13 , @xmath52 and its line are ideal elements , respectively .",
    "then the length @xmath54 is equal to @xmath92 , the angle @xmath129 is equal to @xmath130 , where @xmath91 is the distance between @xmath3 , and the polar of @xmath52 and the length of @xmath41 is equal to @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "the equality @xmath132 proves the statement in this case , too .",
    "it is not clear who investigated first the concept of inversion with respect to hyperbolic geometry .",
    "a synthetic approach can be found in @xcite using reflections in bachmann s metric plane . for our purpose",
    "it is more convenient to use an analytic approach in which the concepts of centres of similitude and axis of similitude can be defined .",
    "we mention that the spherical approach of these concepts can be found in chapter vi and chapter vii in @xcite .",
    "in the hyperbolic case , using the extracted concepts of lengths of segments , this approach can be reproduced .",
    "the product @xmath133 is constant if @xmath134 is a fixed ( but arbitrary ) point ( real , at infinity or ideal ) , @xmath135 are collinear and @xmath104 are on a cycle of the hyperbolic plane ( meaning that in the fixed projective model of the real projective plane it has a proper part ) .    on the basis of lemma 3.1 .",
    "we can define the power of a point with respect to a given cycle .",
    "the _ power _ of a point @xmath134 with respect to a given cycle is the value @xmath136 where the points @xmath13 , @xmath52 are on the cycle , such that the line @xmath29 passes through the point @xmath134 . with respect to lemma 1",
    "this point could be a real , infinite or ideal one .",
    "the _ axis of power _ of two cycles is the locus of points having the same powers with respect to the cycles .",
    "the power of a point can be positive , negative or complex .",
    "( for example , in the case when @xmath104 are real points we have the following possibilities : it is positive if @xmath134 is a real point and it is in the exterior of the cycle ; it is negative if @xmath134 is real and it is in the interior of the cycle , it is infinite if @xmath134 is a point at infinity , or complex if @xmath134 is an ideal point . )",
    "we can also introduce the concept of similarity center of cycles .",
    "the _ centres of similitude _ of two cycles with non - overlapping interiors are the common points of their pairs of tangents touching directly or inversely ( i.e. , they do not separate , or separate the circles ) , respectively .",
    "the first point is the _ external center of similitude _ , the second one is _ the internal center of similitude_.    for intersecting cycles separating tangent lines do not exist , but the internal center of similitude is defined as on the sphere , but replacing @xmath137 by @xmath138 .",
    "more precisely we have    two points @xmath139 which divide the segments @xmath140 and @xmath141 , joining the centers of the two cycles in the hyperbolic ratio of the hyperbolic sines of the radii @xmath142 are the centers of similitude of the cycles . by formula , if @xmath143 then the points @xmath139 are the centers of similitude of the given cycles .",
    "we also have the following    if the secant through a centre of similitude @xmath144 meets the cycles in the corresponding points @xmath145 then @xmath146 and @xmath147 are in a given ratio .",
    "we now discuss the cases for the possible centers of similitude .",
    "we have six possibilities .",
    "i : :    _ the two cycles are circles . _ to get the centers of similitude we have    to solve an equation in @xmath115 . here",
    "@xmath91 means    the distance of the centers of the circles , @xmath148    denotes the respective radii , and @xmath115 is the distance of    the center of similitude to the center of the circle with radius    @xmath149.@xmath150    from which we get that    @xmath151    or , equivalently ,    @xmath152    the two centers corresponding to the two cases of possible signs . if    we assume that    @xmath153 ,    then the center is an ideal point , point at infinity or a real point    according to the cases    @xmath154 , or    @xmath155 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding    center is the external center of similitude . in the other case",
    "we have    @xmath156 ,    and the corresponding center is always a real point .",
    "this is the    internal center of similitude .",
    "ii : :    _ one of the cycles is a circle and the other one is a paracycle . _ the    line joining their centers ( which we call axis of symmetry ) is a real    line , but the respective ratio is zero or infinite . to determine the    centres we have to decide the common tangents and their points of    intersections , respectively .",
    "the external centre is a real , infinite    or ideal point , and the internal centre is a real point .",
    "iii : :    _ one of the cycles is a circle and the other one is a hypercycle . _",
    "the    axis of symmetry is a real line such that the ratio of the hyperbolic    sines of the radii is complex .",
    "the external center is a real , infinite    or ideal point , the internal one is always a real point .",
    "each of them    can be determined as in the case of two circles .",
    "iv : :    _ each of them is a paracycle . _",
    "the axis of symmetry is a real line and    the internal centre is a real point .",
    "the external centre is an ideal    point .",
    "v : :    _ one of them is a paracycle and the other one is a hypercycle . _",
    "the    axis of symmetry ( in the poincar model , with the hypercycle replaced    by the circular line containing it , and the axis containing the two    apparent centers ) is a real line .",
    "the internal centre is a real point .",
    "the external centre is a real , infinite or ideal point .",
    "vi : :    _ both of them are hypercycles . _ the axis of symmetry ( in the poincar    model , with the hypercycle replaced by the circular line containing    it , and the axis containing the two apparent centers ) can be a real    line , ideal line or a line at infinity .",
    "for the internal centre we    have three possibilities as above as well as for the external centre .",
    "we can use the concepts of `` axis of similitude '' , `` inverse and homothetic pair of points '' , `` homothetic to and inverse of a curve @xmath157 with respect to a fixed point @xmath144 ( which ' ' can be real point , a point at infinity , or an ideal point , respectively \" ) as in the case of the sphere .",
    "more precisely we have :    the six centers of similitude of three cycles taken in pairs lie three by three on four lines , called _ axes of similitude _ of the cycles .    from lemma 3.5",
    "it follows immediately that if two pairs of intersection points of a line through @xmath144 with the cycles are @xmath158 and @xmath159 then @xmath160 is independent from the choice of the line .",
    "thus , given a fixed point @xmath144 ( which is the center of the cycle at which we would like to invert ) and any curve @xmath157 , on the hyperbolic plane , if on the halfline joining @xmath144 ( the endpoint of the halfline ) with any point @xmath98 of @xmath157 a point @xmath161 is taken , such that @xmath162 is constant , the locus of @xmath161 is _ called the inverse _ of @xmath157 .",
    "we also use the name _ cycle of inversion _ for the locus of the points whose squared distance from @xmath144 is @xmath163 . among the projective elements of the pole and its polar",
    "either one of them is always real or both of them are at infinity .",
    "thus , in a construction the common point of two lines is well - defined , and in every situation it can be joined with another point ; for example , if both of them are ideal points they can be given by their polars ( which are constructible real lines ) and the required line is the polar of the intersection point of these two real lines .",
    "thus the lengths in the definition of the inverse can be constructed .",
    "this implies that the inverse of a point can be constructed on the hyperbolic plane , too .",
    "finally we remark that all of the concepts and results of inversion with respect to a sphere of the euclidean space can be defined also in the hyperbolic space , the `` basic sphere '' could be a hypersphere , parasphere or sphere , respectively .",
    "we can use also the concept of ideal elements and the concept of elements at infinity , if it is necessary .",
    "it can be proved ( using poincar s ball - model ) that every hyperbolic plane of the hyperbolic space can be inverted to a sphere by such a general inversion .",
    "this map sends the cycles of the plane to circles of the sphere .",
    "in this section we give applications , some of them having analogous on the sphere , and others being completely new ones .",
    "malfatti ( see @xcite ) raised and solved the following problem : _ construct three circles into a triangle so that each of them touches the two others from outside and , moreover , touches also two sides of the triangle . _    the first nice moment was steiner s construction .",
    "he gave an elegant method ( without proof ) to construct the given circles .",
    "he also extended the problem and his construction to the case of three given circles instead of the sides of a triangle ( see in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "cayley referred to this problem in @xcite as _ steiner s extension of malfatti s problem_. we note that cayley investigated and solved a further generalization in @xcite , which he also called steiner s extension of malfatti s problem .",
    "his problem is _ to determine three conic sections so that each of them touches the two others , and also touches two of three more given conic sections .",
    "_ since the case of circles on the sphere is a generalization of the case of circles of the plane ( as it can be seen easily by stereographic projection ) , cayley indirectly proved steiner s second construction .",
    "we also have to mention hart s nice geometric proof for steiner s construction which was published in @xcite .",
    "( it can be found in various textbooks , e.g. @xcite and also on the web . )    in the paper @xcite we presented a possible form of steiner s construction which meet the original problem in the best way .",
    "we note ( see the discussion in the proof ) that our theorem has a more general form giving all possible solutions of the problem .",
    "however , for simplicity we restrict ourself to the most plausible case , when the cycles touch each other from outside . in @xcite",
    "we used the fact that cycles are represented by circles in the conformal model of poincar .",
    "the euclidean constructions of circles of this model gives hyperbolic constructions on cycles in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "to do these constructions manually we have to use special rulers and calipers to draw the distinct types of cycles . for brevity , we think of a fixed conformal model of the embedding euclidean plane and preserve the name of the known euclidean concepts with respect to the corresponding concept of the hyperbolic plane , too .",
    "we now interprete this proof without using models .",
    "we use gergonne s construction ( see the euclidean version in @xcite , and the hyperbolic one in @xcite or @xcite ) which solves the problem _ construct a circle ( cycle ) touching three given circles ( cycles ) of the plane .",
    "_        steiner s construction can be done also in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "more precisely , for three given non - overlapping cycles there can be constructed three other cycles , each of them touching the two other ones from outside and also touching two of the three given cycles from outside .      1 .",
    "construct the cycle of inversion @xmath165 , for the given cycles @xmath164 and @xmath166 , where the center of inversion is the external centre of similitude of them .",
    "( i.e. , the center of @xmath165 is the center of the above inversion , and @xmath167 are images of each other with respect to inversion at @xmath168 . observe that @xmath168 separates @xmath164 and @xmath166 . ) 2 .",
    "construct the cycle @xmath169 touching two cycles @xmath170 and the given cycle @xmath166 , in such a way that @xmath171 touch from outside , and @xmath172 ( or @xmath173 ) touch in such a way that @xmath169 lies on that side of @xmath168 ( or @xmath174 ) on which side of them @xmath166 lies .",
    "3 .   construct the cycle @xmath175 touching @xmath176 and @xmath169 through the point @xmath177 .",
    "4 .   construct malfatti s cycle @xmath178 as the common touching cycle of the four cycles @xmath175 , @xmath179 , @xmath164 , @xmath180 .",
    "to the second step we follow gergonne s construction ( see in @xcite ) .",
    "the third step is a special case of the second one .",
    "( a given cycle is a point now . )",
    "obviously the general construction can be done in this case , too .",
    "finally we have to prove that this construction gives the malfatti cycles .",
    "as we saw , the malfatti cycles exist ( see in @xcite theorem 1 ) .",
    "we also know that in an embedding hyperbolic space the examined plane can be inverted to a sphere .",
    "the trigonometry of the sphere is absolute implying that the possibility of a construction which can be checked by trigonometric calculations , is independent of the fact that the embedding space is a hyperbolic space or a euclidean one .",
    "of course , the steiner construction is just such a construction , the touching position of circles on the sphere can be checked by spherical trigonometry .",
    "so we may assume that the examined sphere is a sphere of the euclidean space and we can apply cayley s analytical methods ( see in @xcite ) by which he proved that steiner s construction works on a surface of second order .",
    "hence the above construction produces the required touches .",
    "the notation of this subsection follows the previous part of this paper : _ the vertices _ of the triangle are @xmath0 , the corresponding angles are @xmath181 and the lengths of the sides opposite to the vertices are @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we also use the notion @xmath182 for the _ perimeter _ of the triangle . let denote @xmath183 the radius of the _ circumscribed cycle _ , the radius of the _ inscribed cycle _",
    "( shortly incycle ) , and the radii of the _ escribed cycles _ opposite to the vertices @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we do not assume that the points @xmath0 are real and the distances are positive numbers .",
    "in most cases the formulas are valid for ideal elements and elements at infinity and when the distances are complex numbers , respectively .",
    "the only exception when the operation which needs to the examined formula has no exact mathematical meaning . before examining hyperbolic triangle centers , we collect some further important formulas on hyperbolic triangles .",

    "the concept of _ staudtian of a hyperbolic triangle _ somehow similar ( but definitely distinct ) to the concept of the euclidean area . in spherical trigonometry",

    "we prefer in this paper the name `` staudtian''to honour the great geometer staudt .",
    "let @xmath185 then we have @xmath186 this observation leads to the following formulas of the staudtian : @xmath187 from the first equality of ( 4.2 ) we get that @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the height of the triangle corresponding to the vertex @xmath3 . as a consequence of this concept we can give homogeneous coordinates of the points of the plane with respect to a basic triangle as follows",

    "if @xmath202 , @xmath203 mean the staudtian of the triangles @xmath204 , @xmath205 , respectively , then , using ( 4.3 ) , we have @xmath206 @xmath207 proving that @xmath208    the _ angular staudtian _ of the triangle defined by the equality @xmath209 is the `` dual '' of the concept of staudtian and thus we have similar formulas for it . from the law of cosines for the angles we have @xmath210 and adding to this the addition formula of the cosine function we get that @xmath211 from this we obtain that @xmath212 analogously we get that @xmath213 from these equations it follows that @xmath214 finally we also have that @xmath215 and from the first equality of ( 4.8 ) we get that @xmath216 the connection between the two staudtians is given by the formula @xmath217 dividing the first equality of ( 4.2 ) by the analogous one in ( 4.8 )",
    "we get that @xmath218 implying the equality @xmath219      we denote the medians of the triangle by @xmath220 and @xmath221 , respectively .",
    "the feet of the medians are @xmath222,@xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "the existence of their common point @xmath98 follows from the menelaos theorem ( @xcite ) .",
    "for instance if @xmath29 , @xmath15 and @xmath63 are real lines and the points @xmath104 and @xmath3 are ideal points then we have that @xmath225 implies that @xmath224 is the middle point of the real segment lying on the line @xmath29 between the intersection points of the polars of @xmath13 and @xmath52 with @xmath29 , respectively ( see fig . 5 ) .        the fact that the centroid exists implies new real hyperbolic statements , e.g. _ consider a real hexagon with six right angles",
    ". then the lines containing the middle points of a side and being perpendicular to the opposite sides of the hexagon are concurrent_.    we have the following formulas connected with the centroid : @xmath226 @xmath227 @xmath228 @xmath229 where @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 mean the signed distances of the points @xmath234 to a line @xmath235 , respectively .",
    "finally we have @xmath236 where @xmath237 is a point of the plane .",
    "( 4.15 ) and ( 4.16 ) are called the `` center - of - gravity '' property of @xmath98 and the `` minimality property '' of @xmath98 , respectively .    using the first order approximation of the hyperbolic functions by their taylor polynomial of order 1",
    ", we get from this formula the following one : @xmath238 which associates the centroid with the physical concept of center of gravity and shows that the center of gravity of three equal weights at the vertices of a triangle is at @xmath98 .",
    "the minimality property of @xmath98 for @xmath239 says that @xmath240 .",
    "this implies @xmath241 . from the second - order approximation of @xmath242",
    "we get that @xmath243 . from this ( take into consideration only such terms whose order is less than or equal to @xmath244 ) we get an euclidean identity characterizing the centroid : @xmath245 . as a further consequence",
    "we can see immediately that the value @xmath246 is minimal if and only if @xmath237 is the centroid .",

    "@xmath29 , @xmath15 and @xmath63 on their respective lines , we also have four possibilities to get a circumscribed cycle .",
    "one of them corresponds to the segments with real lengths and the others can be gotten if we choose one segment with real length and two segments with complex lengths , respectively .",
    "if @xmath0 are real points the first cycle could be a circle , a paracycle or a hypercycle , but the other three are always hypercycles , respectively .",
    "for example , let @xmath248 be a real length , and @xmath249 , @xmath250 be complex lengths , respectively .",
    "then we denote by @xmath251 the corresponding ( ideal ) center and by @xmath252 the corresponding ( complex ) radius .",
    "we also note that the latter three hypercycles have geometric meaning .",
    "these are those hypercycles whose fundamental lines contain a pair from the midpoints of the edge - segments and contain that vertex of the triangle which is the meeting point of the corresponding edges .",
    "the first order taylor polynomial of the hyperbolic functions of distances leads to a correspondence between the hyperbolic staudtians and the euclidean area @xmath256 yealding also further euclidean formulas .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "hence we give the following formula : @xmath259 or , equivalently , the known euclidean dependence of these quantities : @xmath260 .",
    "use the minimality property of @xmath98 for the point @xmath261 .",
    "then we have @xmath262 . approximating this",
    "we get the equation @xmath263 . the functions on the right hand side we approximate of order two .",
    "if we multiply these polynomials and hold only those terms which order at most 2 we can deduce the equation @xmath264 , and hence we deduced the euclidean formula @xmath265 .    applying ( 4.18 ) to a triangle with four ideal circumcenters ,",
    "we get a formula which determines the common distance of three points of a hypercycle from the basic line of it .",
    "in fact , if @xmath91 means the searched distance , than @xmath266 , and we get : @xmath267 for the euclidean analogy of this equation we can use the first order taylor polynomial of the hyperbolic function .",
    "our formula yields to the following @xmath268 implying a well - known connection among the sides , the circumradius and the area of a triangle .",
    "we are aware of the fact that the bisectors of the interior angles of a hyperbolic triangle are concurrent at a point @xmath269 , called the incenter , which is equidistant from the sides of the triangle .",
    "the radius of the _ incircle _ or _ inscribed circle _",
    ", whose center is at the incenter and touches the sides , shall be designated by @xmath149 .",
    "similarly the bisector of any interior angle and those of the exterior angles at the other vertices , are concurrent at a point outside the triangle ; these three points are called _ excenters _ , and the corresponding tangent cycles _ excycles _ or _ escribed cycles_. the excenter lying on @xmath270 is denoted by @xmath271 , and the radius of the escribed cycle with center at @xmath271 is @xmath272 .",
    "we denote by @xmath200 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 the points of the interior bisectors meets @xmath15 , @xmath63 , @xmath29 , respectively .",

    "we note that the excenters and the points of intersection of the sides with the bisectors of the corresponding exterior angles could be points at infinity or could also be ideal points .",
