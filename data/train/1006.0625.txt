    "since the suggestion that some wolf - rayet stars could be creating nebulae via mass loss @xcite , efforts to detect more examples have been ongoing .",
    "the first attempt to morphologically categorise nebulae presumed to have been created by the influence of wr stars was performed by @xcite , who devised three broad categories for possible nebulae : w , r & e.    w type nebulae are those which are assumed to be @xmath1wind - blown bubbles@xmath2 .",
    "these objects were inferred to have been created when material ejected from the star interacted with the surrounding ism .",
    "r type nebulae were postulated to be those in which the strong radiation field from the host star excites the surrounding ism .",
    "these are only visible when the surrounding ism is of sufficient density to produce detectable emission .",
    "our interest lies with the e type nebulae , which were defined to be those which were likely to contain processed ejecta from the progenitor star .",
    "these were suggested by chu to have been formed by a violent mass loss episode recently in the star s history , which may not have been isotropic or homogeneous .",
    "the nebulosity can therefore be very clumped and irregular .",
    "the lifetime of e type nebulae should be much lower than for the other two types , since as the ejected mass expands as it moves away from the star , its surface brightness should diminish very quickly .",
    "it should be noted that actual wolf - rayet nebulae can ( and do ) display any combination of the above traits . @xcite",
    "modified the scheme to refine the definition of e type nebulae , splitting the category into stellar ejecta nebulae and bubble / ejecta ( w / e ) nebulae .",
    "the former covered pure e type nebulae as defined above , the latter introduced to cover the case of ejecta shells having merged with the swept up shell .",
    "the @xcite criteria were used for the southern galactic plane surveys of @xcite and @xcite but not for the northern survey of @xcite which described the probability of a  ring \" nebula being present .",
    "the survey of the environs of all magellanic cloud wr nebulae by @xcite also ignored the chu categorisation system and commented only on the presence of a ring or whether the star was in a superbubble .",
    "in this work we shall consider only morphological information in our classifications of new nebulae and will not delve into the physical details of their formation and evolution .",
    "theory and models of the formation of nebulae around massive stars were presented by @xcite .",
    "recent publicly available h@xmath0 surveys @xcite allow re - inspection of the environs of all known wr stars with a view to identifying new e type nebulosities which can provide constraints on the nucleosynthetic effects of wr stars .",
    "the w , r and e categories of @xcite and @xcite were tested over the following decades as spectroscopic data for the different subtypes of wr nebulae began to appear .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ a _ : not including wr stars discovered by @xcite .",
    "b _ : counting all o3if*/wn6-a stars as isolated wn type .      from table [ progtable ] a curious fact emerges : only two out of the nineteen wr ejecta nebula central stars listed here are binaries . in table",
    "[ binarytable ] we summarise the binary fractions for the wr populations in the mw and lmc along with the fraction that we have identified as ejecta nebulae for each case . the binarity classifications of @xcite and @xcite were adopted for the galactic and lmc populations respectively .",
    "it is striking that the fraction of binary wr stars having ejecta nebulae is so low .",
    "if the fraction of wr stars with ejecta nebulae was the same for binaries as single wr stars we would expect @xmath3 of wr binary stars to possess ejecta nebulae - which translates to around 6 expected in the mw compared to 1 observed ( wr 71 ) . in the lmc",
    "there is one binary wr star with what appears to be an ejecta type nebula , whereas we might expect @xmath4 4 lmc binary wr stars to possess ejecta nebulae .",
    "it has long been speculated that there are two methods of creating wr stars , mass transfer between binary partners and mass loss of an isolated star ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a possible reason for the relative absence of ejecta nebulae around binary wr stars is that mass transfer onto a companion inhibits the mechanism that produces an ejecta nebulae around single wr stars .",
    "the nebulosity surrounding wr 71 ( see figure [ wr71 ] ) is an exception to the previous discussion .",
    "the progenitor star is of spectral type wn6 + ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the binary partner is a low mass evolved stellar remnant , either a neutron star or a black hole and that the supernova which created the collapsed object likely occured when the system was in the disk of the mw .",
    "the loss of mass which occured then left the binary companion ( which we now see as wr 71 ) travelling along whichever velocity vector it possessed at the moment of the supernova .",
    "the large elevation of wr 71 above the galactic plane ( @xmath5 pc ) suggests that a significant component of this velocity was in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "the nebulosity is physically much larger than counterparts in the plane because the density of the ism at this elevation is much lower , implying that all the circumstellar material is ejecta , as there is so little ism to be swept up .",
    "it is odd , considering the previously noted anticorrelation of ejecta nebulae and binary wr systems , that such a clear ejecta nebulae should surround such a star .",
    "however the explanation may lie in the very low mass of the unseen binary companion ( @xmath7 - @xcite ) , since normally wr binary companions are o stars of @xmath8 ( @xcite - tables 18 - 19 ) . a low mass binary companion may not influence the later creation of an ejecta nebula to the same degree as a less evolved high mass companion .",
    "this echoes the work of @xcite , who discussed different scenarios for massive binary star evolution .",
    "if the wr 71 nebulosity originated in this way , then the material that comprises the nebula would be expected to have the same enrichment pattern as other wr nebulae . if , on the other hand , the nebulosity is the product of more complex binary interaction and mass transfer then its composition would be more difficult to predict .",
    "this suggests that over the history of a binary system with two close stars of high initial mass the more massive partner will not create an ejecta nebula - all the mass will be accreted by the partner - while the initially lower mass star can create an ejecta nebula as its mass loss is not as influenced by its low mass post - sn companion .",
    "the morphological classification scheme of @xcite has been discussed and compared with spectroscopically derived abundances of wr nebulae and a modified set of criteria for ejecta nebulae around wr stars derived .",
    "using shs h@xmath0 survey data we have examined the environs of each wr star in the milky way and magellanic clouds for evidence of the presence of nebulae that could be composed of stellar ejecta .",
    "this has yielded one new strong candidate ( wr 8) , confirmed the morphology of another ( wr 71 ) and shown several previously claimed examples to be unlikely candidates .    a prevalence of wnh subtypes amongst ejecta nebulae central stars was found .",
    "in addition an anti - correlation between wr binarity and the occurence of an associated nebulosity was also found .",
    "it is speculated that this may be because binary interactions and mass transfer may inhibit the formation of an ejecta nebula .",
    "this hypothesis is discussed in light of the status of wr 71 - a binary runaway star with an ejecta nebula .",
    "the lmc section of this work would not have been possible without the contribution of mike read from the wide field astronomy unit at the university of edinburgh and his efforts to ` rescue ' the magellanic clouds portion of the shs .",
    "thanks also to the ras library for providing physical access to copies of apjss and allowing the author to scan relevant plates from @xcite at higher quality than those provided in the online versions .",
    "this research made use of montage , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration s earth science technology office , computation technologies project , under cooperative agreement number ncc5 - 626 between nasa and the california institute of technology .",
    "montage is maintained by the nasa / ipac infrared science archive ."
