    "ising and heisenberg models are spin hamiltonians which have been originally proposed in the study of magnetism in pure and diluted materials @xcite . they are widely studied and employed in both classical and quantum contexts . however",
    ", a great interest has also been devoted to the @xmath0 model due to the richness of its phase diagram and the character of its transition @xcite . in particular",
    ", the xy model in two dimensions is of prime interest in the field of statistical mechanics because of its intriguing and unusual phase transition .",
    "recently , the study of the @xmath0 model has been motivated not only due to its applicability in describing real magnetic materials ( for instance , it has been quite recently shown that the phase diagram of the compound rbfe(moo@xmath1)@xmath2 is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions for a two - dimensional xy classical model @xcite ) but as well as in condensed matter systems , for example liquid crystals @xcite and superconductors @xcite , among others .",
    "the one - dimensional version of the quantum spin-1/2 @xmath0 model has been exactly solved by lieb , shultz and mattis @xcite .",
    "although the quantum nature of real magnets can not be forgotten , the study of classical models continues to be an important subject of research .",
    "the two - dimensional classical version of the @xmath0 model has been treated by berezinskii and kosterlitz and thouless @xcite and they showed that the vortices and anti - vortices play a central role in the thermodynamic behavior of the model . for higher dimensions this model ( as well as a planar rotator version ) has been studied through approximate analytical techniques @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite . in addition , classical models in general , and in particular the xy model , have become very popular recently in the context of quantum phase transitions , where a d - dimensional quantum model at @xmath3 is transformed into a classical @xmath4 dimensional one @xcite .",
    "the effort for a better theoretical understanding of the high temperature superconductors has also lead to an increase in treating anisotropic @xmath0 type models @xcite , specially its two - dimensional version .",
    "however , despite the layered structure of these systems , the high temperature superconductors are not strictly two dimensional .",
    "for this reason , inter layer interaction should be important in describing their thermodynamic properties @xcite , as well as the inclusion of possible crystal field interactions .",
    "in this work we study the classical anisotropic @xmath0 model with a crystal field interaction described by the following hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the exchange interaction between spins in the layers parallel to the @xmath7 plane and @xmath8 the exchange interaction between spins in different adjacent layers .",
    "@xmath9 is the crystal field and @xmath10 are the @xmath11 components of a classical spin @xmath12 .",
    "the first sum runs on nearest neighbor spins @xmath13 within the layers and the second sum on nearest neighbor spins @xmath14 between layers ( in order to avoid confusion here and in the following expressions , the subscript of the exchange interaction or the variational parameter in front of the sums will define whether the spins belong to the same layer or to adjacent layers ) .",
    "the last sum is made over the entire @xmath15 spins on the simple cubic lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be written in a more convenient form by means of a polar representation for the spins @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the spherical angles of the spin at the site @xmath19 . in this representation",
    "the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) takes the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 labels the four nearest - neighbor sites of @xmath19 in the @xmath7 plane and @xmath22 the two nearest - neighbor sites of @xmath19 along the @xmath23 direction .",
    "the above model has been treated according to the self - consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) in the case @xmath24 for the three - dimensional model @xcite as well as the planar rotator model @xcite ( in this case there is no @xmath23 spin components ) .",
    "the approach in @xcite , however , only considers the cases @xmath25 and @xmath26 , that is , quasi - isotropic case or weak layer coupling and no general treatment has been done for any value of @xmath27 .    in what concerns the theoretical approach",
    ", it is well known that the scha has been extensively used in the literature @xcite .",
    "it consists of replacing the original hamiltonian ( [ hplanar ] ) by a harmonic one by expanding the corresponding cosines to the second order with effective exchange constants that take into account the nonlinearities of the interactions .",
    "the effective couplings are then chosen to minimize the corresponding free energy of the system . in the present work we use a variational method based on bogoliubov inequality for the free energy to study the model hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in order to obtain its low temperature thermodynamic properties .",
    "this procedure is the same as the scha employed in previous works .",
    "some simplifications are also suggested in order to easier handle the awkward self - consistent implicit equations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present the analytical procedure according to the variational approach for the free energy in order to obtain the thermodynamic properties of the model . in section 3 ,",
    "the numerical results are presented , where the role played by the anisotropy in the presence of a crystal field is shown to be for itself relevant ( for instance , in the context of high temperature superconductors ) .",
    "additional assumptions are also suggested which can make the implicit self - consistent equations easier to be handled .",
    "some concluding remarks are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the present variational approach is based on the bogoliubov inequality for the free energy @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hamiltonian in study given by eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) or ( [ hplanar ] ) , @xmath30 is a trial hamiltonian which can be exactly solved and depends on variational parameters @xmath31 .",

    "the approximate free energy is given by the minimum of @xmath38 with relation to @xmath31 , that is , @xmath39 .",
    "in general , the trial hamiltonian should resemble , in some aspects , the one under study . in this case",
    ", @xmath37 can be chosen as a sum of two parts @xmath40 in such a way that the first part is a kind of a planar hamiltonian @xmath41 and the second term is an axial hamiltonian @xmath42 where @xmath31 and @xmath43 stand for the variational parameters .",
    "this harmonic choice for @xmath37 is also motivated by the fact that at low temperatures the angle differences @xmath44 and @xmath45 so the cosines in eq .",
    "( [ hplanar ] ) can be expanded up to second order to give the terms @xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath48 . since in this case",
    "there is a negligible variation in the @xmath23 components of the spins , we can further assume that @xmath49 and @xmath50 , so the square roots in eq .",
    "( [ hplanar ] ) are eliminated and we end up to a term @xmath51 in the corresponding axial term .",
    "thus , it turns out that this approach will be valid only in the low temperature region .",
    "obtaining the averages regarding the trial hamiltonian requires diagonalizing ( [ ho ] ) .",
    "the planar hamiltonian @xmath48 can be diagonalized in the reciprocal space through the fourier transform of @xmath52 @xmath53 with the inverse transform @xmath54 given by @xmath55 using the transformations ( [ ft ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ hopb ] ) and the fact that the system is translationally invariant we get @xmath56 summing now over the vectors @xmath57 in the @xmath7 plane and @xmath22 along the @xmath23 direction and rearranging terms we obtain the diagonal form of the planar trial hamiltonian @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the diagonalizing of the axial term of the harmonic hamiltonian ( [ hoab ] ) is obtained by introducing the corresponding fourier transform of the @xmath23 component of the spins @xmath64 @xmath65 and the inverse transform @xmath66 given by @xmath67 applying ( [ fts ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ hoab ] ) one gets @xmath68 .",
    "the partition function @xmath69 can be computed by first noting that the planar and the axial parts of the harmonic hamiltonian are independent so @xmath70 since both @xmath48 and @xmath71 are quadratic in their variables one has @xmath72^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] and @xmath73^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath74 .",
    "the free energy @xmath75 is then given by @xmath76 the mean value @xmath77 can be evaluated by using the equipartition theorem resulting in @xmath78 on the other hand , the mean value of @xmath79 is not so straightforward computed . it can be written as @xmath80 where in the first two sums the mean value of the product of the planar and axial terms regarding the trial hamiltonian has been factorized and @xmath81 is the out - of - plane spin fluctuation .    for the gaussian variables @xmath82 we can write @xmath83 where the mean value appearing in the exponential is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 similarly , for the gaussian variable @xmath87 we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath90 . in this way , eq .",
    "( [ hm1 ] ) assumes the form @xmath91 where we have used an additional assumption that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the last term can again be computed from the equipartition theorem and as the terms in the sums do not depend on the respective indexes we have @xmath92 the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bi ] ) is then written as @xmath93 minimizing the above equation with respect to the variational parameters gives an upper bound limit for the free energy .",
    "the variational parameters are determined from the conditions @xmath94 the mathematical expressions for eqs .",
    "( [ dg ] ) are rather lengthy to be reproduced here . however ,",

    "however , from the gaussian variable definitions ( [ gauss])-([difangcf ] ) one can deduce the following additional relation for the fluctuations @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath100 comparing now eqs .",

    "so , according to assumption 2 , the average contribution to the internal energy from each bond scales approximately with the coupling constant of the considered bond .",
