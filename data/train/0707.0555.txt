    "during the last decade much of the combinatorial structure of renormalization of perturbative quantum field theories has been understood in terms of hopf algebras ( starting with @xcite ) .",
    "although this led to many insights in the process of renormalization one could argue that since the elements in the hopf algebra are individual feynman graphs , it is rather unphysical .",
    "rather , one would like to describe the renormalization process on the level of the 1pi green s functions . especially for ( non - abelian )",
    "gauge theories , the graph - by - graph approach of for instance the bphz - procedure is usually replaced by more powerful methods based on brst - symmetry and the zinn - justin equation ( and its far reaching generalization : the batalin - vilkovisky formalism ) .",
    "they all involve the 1pi green s functions or even the full effective action that is generated by them .",
    "the drawback of these latter methods , is that they rely heavily on functional integrals and are therefore completely formal .",
    "the good thing about bphz - renormalization was that if one accepts the perturbative series of green s function in terms of feynman graphs as a starting point , the procedure is completely rigorous .",
    "of course , this allowed the procedure to be described by a mathematical structure such as a hopf algebra .    in this article",
    ", we address the question whether we can prove some of the results on green s functions starting with the hopf algebra of feynman graphs .",
    "we derive the existence of hopf subalgebras generated by the 1pi green s functions .",
    "we do this by showing that the coproduct takes a closed form on these green s functions , thereby relying heavily on a formula that we have previously derived .    in @xcite hopf subalgebras",
    "were given for any connected graded hopf algebra as solutions to dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "it turned out that there was a close relation with hochschild cohomology . for quantum electrodynamics , certain hopf subalgebras of planar binary tree expansions",
    "were considered in @xcite ( cf . also @xcite ) . via a noncommutative hopf algebra of formal diffeomorphisms ( see also @xcite ) , the authors derived dyson s formulas relating the renormalized and unrenormalized proper functions .",
    "the case of non - abelian gauge theories was discussed by kreimer in @xcite where it was claimed that the existence of hopf subalgebras follows from the validity of the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities _ inside _ the hopf algebra of ( qcd ) feynman graphs .",
    "we now fully prove this claim by applying a formula for the coproduct on green s functions that we have derived before in @xcite .",
    "in fact , that formula allowed us to prove compatibility of the slavnov  taylor identities with the hopf algebra structure .",
    "after recalling the preliminaries on feynman graphs , green s functions and some combinatorial factors , we state the key formula for the coproduct on green s functions .",
    "we first consider a scalar field theory ( @xmath0 ) and derive the well - known relations between the renormalized and bare proper functions and the renormalization constants ( eq . below ) .",
    "then , we consider quantum electrodynamics , for which we derive dyson s formulas @xcite : @xmath1 with @xmath2 the bare electric charge and @xmath3 the renormalized charge ( this is eq .",
    "below ) .",
    "finally , we establish a hopf subalgebra consisting of the green s functions in a non - abelian gauge theory . here the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities turn out to play a crucial role .",
    "again , we have the well - known formulas for the renormalized and bare functions ( eq . below ) .",
    "note that these formulas for the proper functions are not derived via the usual procedure of adding counterterms to the lagrangian but follow from the hopf algebraic structure in combination with the fyenman rules .",
    "we will prove the existence of a hopf subalgebra in @xmath4 generated by the three 1pi green s functions relevant for renormalization of quantum field theories .",
    "in particular , we will consider hopf subalgebras in the case of @xmath0-theory , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "we start by briefly recalling the relevant definitions and results from @xcite while referring the reader to that paper for more details .",
    "our starting point is a renormalizable quantum field theory , given for instance by a lagrangian @xmath5 . in perturbation theory ,",
    "one usually associates to each term in the lagrangian an edge or a vertex and starts to built feynman diagrams from them .",
    "it is well - known that for the purpose of renormalization theory , it is enough to consider only one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) diagrams with external structure corresponding to each term in the lagrangian .",
    "for example , in @xmath0-theory , there is one vertex of valence 4 and one edge , and we consider only diagrams with 2 and 4 external edges . in general",
    ", we will consider sums over all 1pi diagrams with the same external structure and this defines the 1pi green s functions @xmath6 with @xmath7 a vertex and @xmath3 and edge . here",
    "@xmath8 is the _ residue _ of @xmath9 ( i.e. the vertex / edge the graph @xmath9 corresponds to after collapsing all internal points ) , and the symmetry factor @xmath10 is the order of the automorphism group of the graph .",
    "it is extended to disjoint unions of graphs by setting @xmath11 with @xmath12 the number of connected components of @xmath9 that are isomorphic to @xmath13 .    in @xcite , connes and kreimer defined a coproduct on feynman diagrams .",
    "this encodes the procedure of renormalization in terms of a hopf algebra ( see the appendix for a quick overview of hopf algebras ) .",
    "let us briefly recall how the coproduct was defined .",
    "one considers the algebra @xmath4 generated by feynman diagrams ( for some quantum field theory ) , on which a coproduct @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15 where the sum is over all subdiagrams @xmath16 that are disjoint unions of 1pi diagrams .",
    "moreover , a counit @xmath17 is defined as the algebra map that takes the value 1 on the identity and zero on any 1pi graph .",
    "the antipode @xmath18 can be defined recursively by @xmath19 it turned out that the bphz - procedure of recursively subtracting the divergent part of a feynman amplitude @xmath20 ( for a given graph @xmath9 ) in order to give the renormalized amplitude @xmath21 , is given by a convolution product in the space of maps from @xmath4 to some space of functions depending on the regularization parameter .",
    "indeed , the feynman amplitude @xmath22 can be understood as such a map : @xmath23 .",
    "the counterterms are given by the map @xmath24 , @xmath25\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath26 a map that projects onto the part of the amplitude that diverges when the regularization parameter goes to 0 ( or infinity in the case of a cutoff ) .",
    "crucial in proving that @xmath24 is an algebra map is the following multiplicative property @xmath27 , which motivated the study of so - called rota - baxter algebras within the context of renormalization ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the case of dimensional regularization",
    ", the regularizing parameter is the complex number @xmath28 ( working in @xmath29 dimensions ) and @xmath26 is the projection onto the pole part of the laurent series in @xmath28 which indeed satisfies the multiplicative property . the renormalized feynman amplitude @xmath30 is given as the convolution product : @xmath31    that this indeed encodes the bphz - procedure can be seen as follows .",
    "let @xmath9 be a 1pi graph . then ,",
    "with the coproduct given by we obtain @xmath32 = -t \\left [ \\bar r ( \\gamma ) \\right ] \\\\",
    "r(\\gamma ) & = \\bar r(\\gamma ) + c(\\gamma)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the so - called _ prepared amplitude_. see ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.3.2 ) for more details on the bphz - procedure .    in the next sections",
    ", we would like to derive a closed form of the coproduct on green s functions .",
    "we do this using a formula that we have derived in @xcite and have shown to imply compatibility of the above coproduct with ward identities in quantum electrodynamics and slavnov  taylor identities in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "it turned out that the corresponding hopf algebras can be consistently quotiented by these identities , giving hopf algebras that have them ` built in ' . from this",
    ", one can deduce that if the unrenormalized feynman amplitudes satisfy the ward or slavnov - taylor identities , then so do the renormalized ones as well as the counterterms .    before stating the aforementioned formula , we introduce some notation .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the number of loops of @xmath9 and @xmath35 the number of ways to insert @xmath16 inside @xmath9 .",
    "explicitly , the latter is given by @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the number of vertices in @xmath9 of type @xmath38 and @xmath39 the number of internal edges in @xmath9 of type @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , @xmath41 is the number of connected components of @xmath16 with residue @xmath42 ( @xmath42 being a vertex or an edge ) .",
    "indeed , then the binomial coefficients arises for each vertex @xmath43 since we are choosing @xmath44 out of @xmath45 whereas for an edge @xmath46 we choose @xmath47 out of @xmath48 _ with repetition _ because of multiple insertions of self - energy graphs on the same edge of @xmath9 . see for more details @xcite , where we have also derived the key formula for the coproduct on the 1pi green s functions : @xmath49 the sum is over all @xmath16 which are disjoint unions of 1pi graphs , whereas @xmath9 is 1pi with the indicated residue @xmath42 .",
    "note that this formula holds for the 1pi green s functions for any quantum field theory , by simply allowing @xmath42 to be vertices and edges of different types ( photon , electron , gluon , etc ... ) .",
    "we illustrate the combinatorial factors introduced above with the following example .",
    "consider the graph @xmath50 then @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , for the number of insertion places , we have for instance : @xmath53      as a warming - up for the next sections where we consider qed and qcd , we consider @xmath0-theory .",
    "the feynman diagrams are constructed from one type of vertex ( of valence 4 ) and one type of edge . as mentioned above",
    ", we will consider only the 2 and 4 points green s functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we start by simplifying the expression @xmath35 a bit .",
