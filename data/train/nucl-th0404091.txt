    "the incorporation of antisymmetrization , or the pauli principle , into the microscopic many - body scattering problem has been a subject of study for five decades .",

    "in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s there was a renewed interest in the scattering theory of indistinguishable particles  @xcite .",
    "these studies brought a new level of mathematical sophistication to the subject of many - body antisymmetrization but had little effect on practical calculations .",

    "they began with a well defined many - body microscopic optical potential formulated using the connected kernel and unitary properties of faddeev  @xcite and alt , grassberger , and sandhas  @xcite , however , because of their complexity , only results for the lightest of nuclei were possible .",
    "when simplified to a tractable problem they were reduced back to the two - body watson approximation  @xcite .",
    "others during the same time period started with the watson theory and then included higher order terms in a consistent manner  @xcite using a cluster or spectator expansion .",

    "both the @xmath71 operator method and the @xmath45 operator method allow the modification of the two nucleon interaction via changes in the propagator .",

    "the actual interactions which include spin are relatively weak and are often ignored .",
    "it is with these precedents plausible to develop a theory which includes both active and spectator nucleons in its antisymmetrization scheme in contrast to the watson approximation .",
    "this is the goal of the next subsections where we will examine the role and identity of the projectile in a many - body optical potential scattering theory .      in traditional nucleon - nucleon scattering theory",
    "the label of projectile is often given to one of the nucleons in the initial state .",
    "this label is not an intrinsic quality and therefore not an adequate quantum number . during the scattering process",
    "the role of the projectile is not unique , its identity is lost , and only by convention do we choose the final state projectile to have the same isospin projection as the initial projectile .    in exact faddeev",
    "elastic nucleon - deuteron scattering the projectile is also not an intrinsic label  @xcite .",
    "the projectile is defined , by convention , in both the initial and final states as the nucleon which is not bound . during the intermediate states of the scattering process this characteristic",
    "is lost and all nucleons are on equal identity footing in the faddeev scheme",
    ".    in nucleon - nucleus scattering is the projectile also indistinguishable ?",
    "a condition for the projectile in nucleon - nucleus scattering is that it is ` fast ' .",
    "this argument was given by watson and collaborators in refs .",
    "@xcite and has some merit . on average , in the center of mass frame of the nucleon - nucleus system , the free projectile nucleon has a momentum magnitude a factor of @xmath1 times greater than the target nucleon .",
    "this constraint is however not sufficiently strong to warrant quantum distinguishability because it is only a mean kinematical expectation .",
    "the strongest criteria for distinguishability of the projectile comes from the approximate form of the theory itself . to create the optical potential one sums up over all the target nucleons ( see eq .  ( [ eq4.11 ] ) ) .",
    "this summation could imply that the target nucleon that is struck in the optical potential theory is actually the average composite nucleon of the nucleus .",
    "for example in an @xmath78 nucleus the _ average _ target nucleon is half proton and half neutron . the theory , because of its approximate nature",
    ", has created an artificial distinguishable composite nucleon target separable from the projectile during the entire collision process .",
    "since this composite half - proton and half - neutron target nucleon has no possibility to be considered identical with the projectile then all traditional kinematic exchange factors which double the strength of the transition operator for either proton - proton or neutron - neutron scattering should be ignored as the composite nucleus optical potential is built via eq .",

    "this ` composite model ' theory does have disadvantages .",
    "the theory should be able to be extended to such processes as charge exchange reactions but it no longer has the apparatus for their inclusion since each target nucleon now only contains a fraction of charge . in the next subsection",
    "we will look at a different , more appealing , theoretical model for antisymmetrization .      in the first - order many - body theory",
    "there is a difference between the projectile nucleon and the struck target nucleon which has not yet been exploited . in fig .",
    "[ fig4.2 ] , the @xmath45-folding operator model shows that the struck target nucleon is acted upon by the mean field and thus explicitly interacts with the nucleus while the projectile does not .",
    "this differentiates the two nucleons and is true throughout the whole calculation .",
    "the projectile nucleon at all times carries the characteristic that it is absent an interaction with the spectator core .",
    "conversely , the struck target nucleon interacts via a mean field with the spectator core throughout the entire reaction .",
    "if the @xmath71-folding theory has the projectile interact with the infinite nuclear matter of the core than it contains higher order terms  @xcite and the projectile will be difficult to distinguish .",

    "the potentials are fit to different nucleon - nucleon datasets ranging from 1986 - 1999 and the calculations use either the traditional watson approximation ( top half ) or the many - body antisymmetrization ( bottom half ) .",
    "the startling conclusion is that the watson approximation was the best fit if using the 1986 dataset but with the introduction of the 1993 dataset the many - body antisymmetrization became the better fit . with the 1999 dataset",
    "the fits of the many - body antisymmetric technique further improved while the watson approximation version became even worse .",
    "again these differences can also be ascertained directly by examining figs .",
    "[ fig3.8]-[fig3.10 ] .",
    "the nucleon - nucleus calculation does use the off - shell two - body amplitudes .",
    "it was shown however that if two potentials agreed on - shell ( they both fit the nucleon - nucleon dataset to a high degree of accuracy ) than differences off - shell were near inconsequential for nucleon - nucleus elastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "for example in the production of table  [ t4.2 ] a nijmegen potential  @xcite was used for the 1993 data - set calculation .",
    "these results differ with a bonn potential  @xcite calculation which is based on the same 1993 dataset by at most 1% .",
    "there are two calculations listed in table  [ t4.2 ] that use the 1999 dataset .",
    "they differ on their use of charge dependent terms .",
    "the leftmost of the two columns ( depicted _ 1999 _ ) uses the neutron - proton amplitudes for neutron - proton , proton - proton , and neutron - neutron calculations so their is no charge dependence in this calculation . since neutron - proton amplitudes contain both even and odd momentum space - spin terms it can create a proton - proton amplitude by using only the odd terms from the neutron - proton amplitude .",
    "the column labeled _ 1999cd _ calculates the neutron - proton and proton - proton amplitudes separately based on different datasets thereby introducing charge dependencies and thus a more accurate amplitude .",
    "these charge dependencies can not be used in a systematic method for many - body antisymmetrization . to calculate the proton - proton amplitudes of the theory presented within one",
    "must use neutron - proton amplitudes as a source for the even momentum space - spin amplitudes , this process thus nullifies the effect of charge dependencies .",
    "this is why table  [ t4.2 ] has the same values for total cross section using the 1999 and 1999cd datasets while using the many - body antisymmetrization techniques .",
    "incidentally , the differences in the neutron - proton phase shifts over time is not without controversy .",
    "when the 1993 dataset was defined there were criteria used to refine the set which threw out some experimental data  @xcite .",
    "there have been concerns expressed over this procedure s validity and scientific merit  @xcite .",
    "this is still an open question and it is likely that the nucleon - nucleon dataset will not be static in the years that follow .",
    "this work has presented antisymmetry in the nucleon - nucleus many - body problem .",
    "the new results are a treatment of antisymmetry in the nucleon - nucleus first - order microscopic optical potential scattering calculation with a truer many - body flavor .",
    "the theoretical strength of the proton - proton and neutron - neutron amplitudes used in the many - body calculations are cut in half and their character is changed to include states that have never been used to describe proton - proton scattering ( for example the @xmath88 state is now included at half strength ) .",
    "traditionally these states were referred to as forbidden because they violate the pauli principle in two - body scattering .",
    "these states , although unphysical in proton - proton and neutron - neutron scattering in a two - body context , are physical in the approximate many - body context presented here .",
    "the many - body theory also contains exchange in a natural way and allows for further theoretical development to include inelastic reactions .",
    "results show that this new many - body antisymmetric theory represent the experimental data better than the watson approximation over a large range of reactions .",
    "this improvement was only apparent recently with the use of the newest nucleon - nucleon potentials which have significant differences than their for - bearers .",
    "many researchers in nucleon - nucleus scattering theory still use potentials based on datasets from the 1980 s or before  @xcite like the paris  @xcite or bonn - b  @xcite potentials .",
    "these potentials have an extensive history of use in this field and are still of value if the best effective potentials are sought , but from a microscopic point of view they are inadequate because they fail to describe nucleon - nucleon data accurately .",
    "the use of the microscopic first - order optical potential in nuclear reaction studies has been extensive .",
    "more fundamental theories have been advanced but it is still one of the few that is able to produce results when more than a few nucleons are involved .",
    "this work has re - examined its antisymmetric character and with little rigor has suggested a modification which has improved its validity and power .",
