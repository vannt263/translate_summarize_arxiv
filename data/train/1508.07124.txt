    "a red blood cell  ( rbc ) has been a standard test bed of membrane physics due to its simple structure lacking a nucleus and organelles .",
    "early studies , treating a rbc as a lipid bilayer bag , already rendered insightful understanding of various properties , to name a few , biconcave shapes@xcite , flickering phenomenon  @xcite , and tank - treading motion  @xcite .",
    "still there are certain features signifying the role of other substructure ; a spectrin network ( cytoskeleton ) coupled to the bilayer is found to be responsible for the shape transformation sequence  @xcite , large - scale shape changes under shear flow  @xcite , and crenated shapes  @xcite .",
    "many attempts have been made in order to provide simplified descriptions of the cytokeleton as for its effects on non - trivial shapes and fluctuation of rbcs  @xcite .    meanwhile , theoretical works  @xcite analyzed the fluctuation spectrum measured by zilker _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and introduced a picture of a composite membrane , that is , a lipid bilayer sparsely connected to the cytoskeleton . in ref .",
    "@xcite , through an empirical approach , it was claimed that the coupling to the cytoskeleton induces surface tension in such a way that the effective bending modulus of the lipid bilayer undergoes an abrupt jump at the crossover length  @xcite .",
    "this claim was elaborated by considering the cytoskeleton explicitly as spring meshwork  @xcite , where the authors examine the elastic energy of the meshwork as a function of the membrane area coarsely grained at the mesh size @xmath0 and thereby conclude that the tension contribution vanishes suddenly at length scale @xmath0 .",
    "also , a model hamiltonian was proposed , assuming infinitely strong coupling of the membrane at sites linked to the cytoskeleton , so as to explain the induced tension in the long wavelength fluctuations  @xcite .    in this",
    "regard it seems that a rbc as a composite membrane necessarily acquires surface tension at long length scales .",
    "however , clear signature of the surface tension was not always observable , and also there exists subtle variance between recent observations .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported the shape dependence of the fluctuation spectrum where the tension contribution is fairly pronounced for spherocype - shaped rbcs but almost unnoticeable for discocytes .",
    "in contrast , popescu _ et al .",
    "_ observed clearly the induced surface tension irrespective of shapes  @xcite . using similar interferometric technique in ref .",
    "@xcite , many red blood cells showed bending dominant fluctuations at short wavelengths and confining dominant long wavelength fluctuations , but the intermediate tension dominant region could be seen from few number of the samples @xcite . in all those experiments ,",
    "the notion of tension jump seems to be not evident as derived from the theories  @xcite .",
    "the origin of such diversity is left unknown , and more experimental evidences together with theoretical models are anticipated in order to draw a unified picture of a rbc as a composite membrane .    in this study , we propose an exactly solvable model to describe elastic properties of a rbc membrane , positing that the cytoskeleton is spring network and the membrane is sparsely and regularly linked to the network via harmonic coupling .",
    "unlike assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coupling strength is finite and may even be weak due to flexibility of protein complex linking the bilayer and the cytoskeleton and also due to fast dissociation / association process of the cytoskeleton controlled by atp concentration @xcite .",
    "although governing factors are not known precisely , it is reasonable to think that the coupling strength can vary depending on experimental conditions , and observation results should intrinsically be diverse . in our consideration",
    ", the coupling strength is introduced as an essential model parameter which interplays with other involved energy scales to determine the tension emergence .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a model describing energies associated with fluctuations of the membrane , deformation of the spring network , and the coupling between them .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the equilibrium fluctuation of the membrane is obtained in sec .",
    "iii , and analytic expression of the fluctuation spectrum is derived in sec .",
    "iv . section v consists of three subsections . in sec . v. a",
    ", various kinds of the qualitatively distinctive fluctuation spectra are analyzed .",
    "we find that at length scale shorter than the network mesh size , the cytoskeleton elasticity is negligible irrespective of the coupling strength , and the fluctuation spectrum of the membrane exhibits the fluid - like behavior . at long wavelengths ,",
    "the coupling to the cytoskeleton imparts elasticity to the membrane , and yet resulting features in the fluctuation spectrum thereof are strongly dependent on the system parameters . the effect of confining potential is discussed in sec . v. b. in the last subsection v. c , we compare our results with previous studies , in particular related to the tension  jump \" stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and conclusion follows in sec .",
    "we consider a lipid bilayer of a rbc as an almost flat , symmetric(zero spontaneous curvature ) fluid membrane . assuming small deformations without overhangs , the membrane height can be represented by a single - valued function @xmath1 where @xmath2 spans the flat reference plane at @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads as : @xmath4=\\int d{\\mathbf r } ~\\kappa ( \\nabla^2 h)^2 + \\gamma h^{2 } ~.\\ ] ] the second term , so called the confining potential , is introduced phenomenologically to describe the long wavelength fluctuations of red blood cell membranes @xcite .",
    "closed geometry @xcite , periodic pinning @xcite and excluded - volume effect @xcite were suggested as the physical origin of the confinement , yet no consensus has been met . although the term has been widely used for many experimental studies @xcite , there are also skeptical views on the necessity of the confining potential @xcite .",
    "to embrace every possible situations , we do not discard this phenomenological term from the model .",
    "however , overall discussion in this paper will be made with very weak confinement so that the effect of the confinement is marginal to the fluctuation spectrum ; the limit @xmath5 would not hurt the key lessons of our research .",
    "more subtle issues on the confining potential would be discussed in sec . v.",
    "b. we also mention that in order to reflect area conserving property of a bilayer , the bending energy usually includes effective bare surface tension , which is dependent on the excess area of the bilayer and ambient temperature @xcite .",
    "however , we intentionally discard the bare tension in the hamiltonian @xmath6 in order to explicate the induced tension by the cytoskeleton .",
    "another ingredient comprising the system is the cytoskeleton which is two - dimensional regular network of spectrin tetramers .",
    "we consider the cytoskeleton as spring network  @xcite and model it as a sparse square array of beads connected by springs . since we assumed the small deformations , the in - plane stretching and the out - of - plane deformation",
    "is approximately decoupled @xcite .",
    "in addition , the single particle tracking experiment also showed that the diffusion of the band-3 proteins which are connected to the spectrins are significantly restricted @xcite .",
    "hence , we assume that the in - plane position of the @xmath7th bead is fixed to form a square lattice with uniform spacing @xmath0 and represented by the position vector @xmath8 with integers @xmath9 and @xmath10 . on the other hand , we allow out - of - plane displacements of the beads and express the displacement of the @xmath7th bead by @xmath11 .",
    "the imbalance in the displacements between the nearest neighboring beads brings about either contraction or dilation of the connecting springs . assuming the identical spring constant @xmath12 , the elastic energy cost for such deformation of the spring network is , @xmath13=\\sum_{\\langle { \\bf x}_{i},{\\bf u}\\rangle}k[\\phi({\\mathbf x}_{i})-\\phi({\\mathbf x}_{i}+{\\bf u})]^2~,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 or @xmath15 are the primitive vectors for the square lattice .",
    "in fact , the cytoskeleton is closer to triangular ( or hexagonal ) network .",
    "yet we expect that effects of the symmetry details must be weak on the qualitative properties of the membrane fluctuation and hence pursue simple analytic approach , remaining in the picture of the four - fold network .",
    "we finally introduce interaction between the membrane and the spring network .",
    "the coupling between the two systems is mediated by protein inclusions in the membrane and adaptor proteins  ( for example , ankyrin ) bridging the membrane inclusion and the spectrin network .",
    "hence , the coupling must be the consequence of various kinds of microscopic interactions among the membrane , inclusions , adaptor proteins , and spectrins . rather than deriving the coupling energy from all these complex origins , here we approximate it under the assumption that the separation between the membrane and the coupled cytoskeleton @xmath16 is small .",
    "as the leading order of taylor expansion , we can then model the coupling energy by harmonic potentials between the out - of - plane displacement of the bead and the height undulation of the membrane at the bead location @xmath17 : @xmath18=\\sum_{{\\mathbf x}_{i}}v[h({\\mathbf x}_{i})-\\phi({\\mathbf x}_{i})]^2~,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 measures the coupling strength . since recent numerical research based on the harmonic membrane - cytoskeleton interaction showed good agreement with experiments on red blood cell membranes @xcite",
    ", we expect the harmonic approximation is sufficient and ignore the higher order terms @xcite .    in total , the system hamiltonian of our interest is composed as @xmath20 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors considered the bilayer - cytoskeleton interaction by imposing a hard constraint that the membrane height at the coupling site is identical with the bead location , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "in our model , this corresponds to an extreme situation of infinite coupling ( @xmath22 ) , and the behaviors at general coupling strengths are still to be investigated .",
    "even though steric interaction can also be involved to correlate the membrane and the cytoskeleton @xcite , this research neglects the excluded - volume effect and assumes the  phantom \" membrane and network .",
    "equilibrium properties of the system can be extracted from evaluating the canonical partition function : @xmath23}~ \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\int { \\cal d}h ~e^{-\\beta { \\cal h}_{\\mathrm{eff}}[h ] } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second line defines the effective hamiltonian for the height deformation of the membrane , @xmath24 $ ] , which can be obtained by integrating the boltzmann factor over the fields @xmath25 .    for mathematical convenience ,",
    "let us obtain the hamiltonian in the momentum space .",
    "for the height field @xmath26 of the membrane , we employ the fourier transform in two dimensions , @xmath27 here we discretize the space in units of the length @xmath28 which is a microscopic length scale , e.g. , molecular size of a lipid molecule consisting the membrane , and let the momentum @xmath29 take values to satisfy the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath30 for @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the lateral dimension of the reference plane .",

    "<S> we find that the coupling modifies the fluctuation spectrum at wavelengths longer than the mesh size of the network , while leaving the fluid - like behavior of the membrane intact at shorter wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation spectra can be markedly different , depending on not only the relative amplitude of the bilayer bending energy with respect to the cytoskeleton deformation energy but also the bilayer - cytoskelton coupling strength . </S>"
