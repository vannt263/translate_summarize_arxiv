    "the above analysis implies that the quantum critical points at @xmath106 ( where @xmath245 ) correspond to sc - i and i - sc transitions alternately , associated with the change of ordering in the antisymmetric mode from phase - ordered to charge - ordered ground state .",
    "these transitions are marked by a dramatic qualitative change in the shape of the non - linear @xmath2 curves , and in the @xmath4-dependence of the ohmic resistance , as @xmath0 crosses @xmath106 .",
    "however , note that unlike the 2d sit , the quantum critical points can not be easily identified in the transport properties , e.g. as crossing points of isotherms where @xmath246 exhibits a metallic behavior . in the critical regime ( @xmath247 ) , the antisymmetric mode is characterized by power - law correlations @xmath248 and consequently @xmath249 this reflects once again an insulating behavior , characteristic to the 1d nature of the system .",
    "it stems from the presence of a gapless mode ( the symmetric plasmon ) , which is not immune to backscattering processes .",
    "in this study , we have shown that the low-@xmath4 transport properties of a ladder  like superconducting device subject to a perpendicular magnetic field may signify a multitude of quantum phase transitions from a sc to insulating phases alternately , when its parameters are tuned close to the 2d sit .",
    "these transitions stem from the quantum mechanical nature of the vortex chain accommodated along the central axis of the device , and reflect the competition between a josephson coupling and a charging energy between the sc edges of the device , which govern the antisymmetric phase  charge mode .",
    "the former dominates near commensurate values of the vortex density , and the latter near incommensurate ( @xmath1-integer ) densities .",
    "the quantum critical points are of the ising type : this is a manifestation of the @xmath250 symmetry characterizing the antisymmetric mode , associated with interchanging the two legs of the ladder .    the analysis presented in sec . [ sec : transport ] indicates , however , that the electric transport properties are complicated by the presence of a gapless symmetric phase ",
    "charge mode , which provides a dissipative environment . as a result ,",
    "the voltage response to a current bias does not exhibit a strictly superconducting behavior even in the phases classified as sc .",
    "nevertheless , for weakly disordered systems it is possible to observe a clear signature of the sc nature of these phases at finite @xmath4 and @xmath3 . subtracting the contribution of backscattering exclusive to the symmetric mode , which can be viewed as a resistor connected in series , one obtains an activated behavior of the @xmath2 curve and the @xmath4-dependent resistance",
    "[ see fig . 1 and eq . ( [ logr_ic ] ) ] .",
    "this behavior is sharply distinct from the insulating phases , where the differential resistance @xmath236 exhibit a zero - bias anomaly peak [ see fig . 2 ] .",
    "moreover , in principle it is possible to detect the quantum critical points ( @xmath106 ) separating the two phases by probing the @xmath0-dependence of the activated gap [ eq .",
    "( [ logr_ic ] ) ] .",
    "it should be noted that the analysis thus far relies on some crucial simplifying assumptions . in particular , it has been assumed that the model for the antisymmetric mode is tuned to a self - dual point , where @xmath225 . in this special point , where both the phase and charge fields are not well - defined , the chain of vortices is exactly describable in terms of free fermions .",
    "the question arises , to what extent our results are robust against a finite detuning away from the self - dual point , i.e. when @xmath251 .",
    "such corrections induce interactions among the fermions .",
    "however , since in both the sc and insulating phases the fermions are massive and excitations are gapped , these interactions can be treated perturbatively as long as @xmath252 .",
    "this approximation fails when @xmath253 and the critical point is shifted , but the ising - type nature of the transition is maintained @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology manifested by the transport properties as discussed above would therefore be essentially the same .",
    "another point of concern when adapting the model to describe a realistic system is the role of finite size effects . in sec .",
    "[ sec : transport ] , the correlation functions were evaluated for finite @xmath4 assuming that the length of the system @xmath254 .",
    "however , we note that the sc nanowires studied , e.g. , in ref . , typically have a finite length of the order of a few microns .",
    "this introduces an additional low - energy cutoff @xmath255 . using typical values of the plasma velocity for @xmath256 ( see , e.g. , ref . )",
    ", we estimate @xmath257k .",
    "this implies that for sub - kelvin temperatures , @xmath258 effectively replaces @xmath4 as the low - energy cutoff . in the sc phases , the activated contribution to the resistance",
    "is therefore expected to be @xmath259 .",
    "noting that @xmath258 is also associated with the zero - point energy of phase - fluctuations , this represents contribution due to macroscopic quantum tunneling of vortices out of a metastable state in the finite - size sc device @xcite .",
    "finally , we wish to point out that a ladder  like sc device where the parameters are conveniently tunable ( e.g. , a josephson ladder ) can serve as an interesting playground for the study of emergent fractional degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , when the gap @xmath260 vanishes , the eigenstates of eq .",
    "( [ h_-_majo ] ) ( at zero energy ) become majorana fermions . therefore , as recently proposed by tsvelik @xcite , inhomogeneous sc devices can be potentially utilized to realize localized majorana modes at interfaces between superconducting and insulating segments .",
