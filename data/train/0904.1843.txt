    "second , lattice defects or targeted implementations of e.g. boron ( @xmath0 ) clusters  @xcite result in random samples . thereby the range of the disorder is of great importance  @xcite : for long - range disorder , as caused by ripples in the graphene sheet , the two independent corners of the brillouin zone are untangled and long - wavelength excitations can be modeled by an effective dirac equation .",
    "if the scattering potential is short ranged , however , inter - valley scattering between the two inequivalent dirac cones becomes possible .",

    "actually we expect metallic behavior of disordered quasi-1d gnrs if the localization length becomes comparable or even larger than the longitudinal ribbon size  @xcite .    to address these questions , in this work we investigate the electronic structure and the localization properties of disordered gnrs by means of unbiased numerical techniques .",

    "we calculate @xmath51 as @xmath52 a finite  size analysis shows that upon increasing the ribbon width the gap narrows for any bulk disorder @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , for edge disorder we observe a non - monotonic behavior that can be explained by the competition of two effects : increasing the width of the gnr on the one hand weakens the influence of the disorder as the ratio of edge to bulk sites decreases .",
    "an increasing number of lattice sites , on the other hand , reduces the finite size effects and closes the gap .",
    "thus , for @xmath53 , the gap first broadens when the gnr width is increased , and then converges to the gap size of the ordered system , which finally vanishes in the limit @xmath37 .",
    "similar studies for a different type of edge disorder , in which sites are randomly removed from the ribbon edges , can be found in the literature  @xcite .     for particular zigzag gnrs .",

    "the temporal fluctuations of about 5 - 10% can be eliminated by time averaging .",
    "varying the initial state and/or comparing different disorder realizations , leads to additional uncertainties of about 10 - 20% .",
    "therefore we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : gnr_ll ] sample averages over several combinations of initial states and disorder realizations .",
    "figure  [ fig : gnr_ll ] indicates that the influence of the boundary ( armchair / zigzag ) is only of minor importance for the localization length .",
    "but we observe a pronounced difference between bulk and edge disorder , with @xmath67 also for large values of @xmath7 for most ribbon widths . for any fixed disorder strength",
    ", a decreasing width of the gnr systematically reduces @xmath65 since the influence of the lateral dimension is weakened and the system approaches the 1d limit .",
    "values of @xmath65 which are significantly larger than half the system size ( blue solid line ) have to be taken with care since a reliable determination of the localization length requires @xmath68 . clearly , the precise value of @xmath65 in those cases is of minor importance due to the metallic behavior of such finite gnrs .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the obtained localisation lengths with estimates based on other methods  @xcite suffers from the different investigated disorder models .",
    "nevertheless , the orders of magnitude match and the general tendencies are reproduced : the impact of disorder increases with decreasing ribbon width and the boundary type does not influence the localization length significantly for strong disorder . the pronounced dependence of the localization length on the ribbon type ( armchair or zigzag ) for the weakly disordered case reported in refs .",
    "is absent in our data .",
    "we attribute this to the different disorder models used .",
    "to conclude , anderson localization takes place in disordered quasi-1d graphene nanoribbons , but taking into account the actual device dimensions gnrs can be conducting at weak disorder strengths .",
    "this has been proven by calculating the localization length and time evolution of single particle states . within the local distribution approach anderson localization",
    "is identified by a log - normal distribution of the ldos that shifts towards zero for increasing system size .",
    "the ldos is directly measurable by scanning tunneling spectroscopy and therefore allows for a direct comparison of theory and experiment .",
