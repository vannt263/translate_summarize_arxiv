    "excising the divergences that arise in perturbative calculations in quantum field theory necessitates a renormalization procedure that leads to ambiguities when one works to finite order [ 1 ] .",
    "the mass scale @xmath3 that arises in the course of renormalization is one such ambiguity ; this leads to the renormalization group ( rg ) equation , which permits one to sum all logarithmic corrections arising in perturbation theory .",
    "there are additional ambiguities , even when using a mass independent renormalization scheme ( rs ) [ 2,3 ] .",
    "they can be parameterized by the expansion coefficients for the @xmath4-function associated with the coupling [ 4 ] beyond two - loop order and the expansion coefficients for the anomalous mass dimension beyond one - loop order [ 5 ] .    in ref .",

    "[ 8 ] , the rs dependence of @xmath7 is examined and it is shown how by choosing a particular scheme , it is possible to express @xmath7 in terms of rs invariants and a two - loop coupling ; in another rs , @xmath7 is only quadratic in the coupling . in this paper",
    ", we will extend this discussion of rs dependence to a process in which there is an additional ambiguity due to mass dependence ; in particular we will consider the amplitude @xmath0 for the semi - leptonic @xmath2 quark decay @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that even when using a mass independent rs , by combining rg summation with a judicious choice of rs , it is possible to express @xmath0 in terms of rs invariants and the pole mass of the @xmath2 quark .",
    "furthermore , dependence on the renormalization scale parameter @xmath3 is replaced by dependence on the value of the running coupling and the running mass at some mass scale .",
    "one choice of rs has @xmath0 being reduced to a ll sum , another choice has the running coupling and mass expressed in closed form .",
