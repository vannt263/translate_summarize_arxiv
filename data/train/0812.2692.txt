    "from the present neutrino data on neutrino oscillations , we know that lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) occurs in the neutral lepton sector . however , we do not know yet if this lfv occurs in the charged lepton as well .",
    "even if it occurs , we do not know either if these two violations are related or not . within the standard model with mass less neutrinos",
    "there is not lfv .",
    "futhermore , it is extremely suppressed even with massive neutrinos .",
    "in contrast , in supersymmetric ( susy ) models with majorana neutrinos lfv can be sizeable .",
    "in particular , we consider here the spectrum of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) extended with three rigth handed neutrinos , @xmath0 , and their susy partners , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , and with the seesaw mechanism implemented to generate the neutrino masses , where it is known that large lfv rates occur .",
    "these are induced by the soft susy breaking slepton masses and are transmitted to the lepton sector by means of the yukawa neutrino couplings , which can be large if the neutrinos are of majorana type , and via loops of susy particles .",
    "therefore , in the context we work within of susy - seesaw models the lfv in both the neutral and the charged lepton are closely related .    regarding the seesaw mechanism we use the parameterisation proposed in  @xcite , which is very useful to implement the neutrino data into our analysis of lfv .",
    "with this parameterisation , the @xmath4 yukawa coupling and dirac mass matrices are set by @xmath5 , with the @xmath4 orthogonal matrix @xmath6 defined by three complex angles @xmath7 ( @xmath2 ) which represent the additional mixing introduced by the right handed neutrinos .",
    "the other quantities in this formula are @xmath8 , @xmath9 gev ; @xmath10 denotes the three light neutrino masses , and @xmath11 the three heavy ones .",
    "@xmath12 is given by the three ( light ) neutrino mixing angles @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and three phases , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . with this parameterisation",
    "it is easy to accommodate the neutrino data , while leaving room for extra neutrino mixings ( from the right handed sector ) .",
    "it further allows for large yukawa couplings @xmath17 by choosing large entries in @xmath18 and/or @xmath7 .",
    "here we focus in the particular lfv proccesses : 1 ) semileptonic @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) decays and 2 ) @xmath25 conversion in heavy nuclei .",
    "the predictions in the following are for two different constrained mssm - seesaw scenarios , with universal and non - universal higgs soft masses .",
    "the respective parameters ( in addition to the previous neutrino sector parameters ) are : 1 ) cmssm - seesaw : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath3 , and sign(@xmath29 ) , and 2 ) nuhm - seesaw : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath3 , sign(@xmath29 ) , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the predictions presented here include a full one - loop computation of the susy diagrams contributing to these lfv processes and do not use the leading logarithmic ( llog ) nor the mass insertion approximations . in the case of semileptonic tau",
    "decays we have not included the boxes which are clearly subdominant , but we have included correspondingly : the @xmath32 , z and higgs bosons , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , mediated diagrams in @xmath35 , and the z boson and @xmath36 higgs boson mediated diagrams in @xmath37 .",
    "the hadronisation of quark bilinears in all these semileptonic channels is performed within the chiral framework , using chiral perturbation theory  @xcite to order and resonance chiral theory  @xcite whenever the resonances like the @xmath38 , etc .",
    ", play a relevant role .",
    "the predictions for the @xmath25 conversion rates include the full set of susy one - loop contributing diagrams , mediated by @xmath32 , z and higgs bosons , as well as boxes . in this case",
    "we have followed very closely the general parameterisation and approximations of ref .",
    "here we present the predictions for br(@xmath35 ) ( @xmath39 ) , br(@xmath37 ) ( @xmath22 ) , br(@xmath40 ) ( @xmath24 ) and cr(@xmath25 , nuclei ) within the previously described framework and compare them with the following experimental bounds : br@xmath41 , br@xmath42 , br@xmath43 , br@xmath44 , br@xmath45 , br@xmath46 , br@xmath47 , cr@xmath48 and cr@xmath49 .",
    "+    as a general result in lfv processes that can be mediated by higgs bosons we have found that the @xmath34 and @xmath36 contributions are relevant at large @xmath50 if the higgs masses are light enough .",
    "it is in this aspect where the main difference between the two considered scenarios lies . within the cmssm ,",
    "light higgs @xmath34 and @xmath36 bosons are only possible for low @xmath51 ( here we take @xmath52 to reduce the number of input parameters ) .",
    "in contrast , within the nuhm , light higgs bosons can be obtained even at large @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] it is shown that some specific choices of @xmath53 and @xmath54 lead to values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 as low as 110 - 120 gev , even for heavy @xmath51 values above 600 gev .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity to the higgs sector is higher in the nuhm .",
    "+    we start by presenting     +    the results for the semileptonic tau decays . the mentioned sensitivity to the higgs sector within the nuhm scenario",
    "can be seen in fig .",
    ". concretely , the brs of the channels @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 present a growing behaviour with @xmath51 , in the large @xmath63 region , due to the contribution of light higgs bosons , which is non - decoupling .",
    "the decays involving kaons and @xmath64 mesons are particularly sensitive to the higgs contributions because of their strange quark content , which has a stronger coupling to the higgs bosons . on the other hand ,",
    "the largest predicted rates are for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , dominated by the photon contribution , which are indeed at the present experimental reach in the low @xmath51 region .",
    "the comparison between the various contributions to the semileptonic lfv tau decays in the nuhm scenario for br(@xmath67 ) and br(@xmath68 ) can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "it is clear from this figure , that @xmath67 is dominated by the photon contribution , except in the large @xmath51 region , say @xmath69 gev , and large @xmath3 region , say @xmath70 , where the higgs boson contribution plays an important role .",
    "similar results are found for @xmath71 .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath72 , the photon contribution dominantes largely the rates in all the studied region of the parameter space and therefor it is not sensitive at all to the higgs sector . in the @xmath73 channel , only the higgs boson contributes , but the rates are extremely small .",
    "they are indeed much smaller that decays into kaons due to the fact that the higgs couplings to the pions are proportional to @xmath74 whereas the the higgs couplings to the pions are proportional to @xmath75 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath68 channel is dominated by the @xmath36 higgs boson contribution for all @xmath51 values , and for moderate and large @xmath50 , say @xmath76 .",
    "notice that for smaller values of @xmath50 it is , however , dominated by the z boson contribution .    a set of useful formulae for all these channels , within the mass insertion approximation which are valid at large @xmath50 , have also being derived by us in  @xcite .",
    "we include the most relevant of these aproximate formulas here , for completeness .",
    "the approximate results for the @xmath34-mediated contributions and the @xmath32-mediated contributions are shown separately for comparison , @xmath77    we have shown that the predictions with these formulae agree with the full results within a factor of about 2 . in the case of @xmath78",
    "this comparison is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "it is also clear , from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] that the approximation works much better in the large @xmath3 region , @xmath79 where the @xmath34 boson dominates .",
    "similar conclusions are found for @xmath80 .",
    "the next relevant channel in sensitivity to the higgs sector is @xmath57 , but it is still below the present experimental bound . to our knowledge , there are not experimental bounds yet available for @xmath81 and @xmath59 .    finally , the maximum sensitivity to the higgs sector is found for @xmath61 and @xmath62 channels , largely dominated by the @xmath36 boson exchange .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows that br(@xmath78 ) reaches the experimental bound for large heaviest neutrino mass , large @xmath50 , large @xmath7 angles and low @xmath56 . for the choice of input parameters in this figure",
    ", it occurs at @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 gev .",
    "next we comment on the results for @xmath25 conversion in nuclei .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows our predictions of the conversion rates for titanium as a function of @xmath51 in both cmssm and nuhm scenarios .",
    "as in the case of semileptonic tau decays , the sensitivity to the higgs contribution is only manifest in the nuhm scenario .",
    "the predictions for cr(@xmath25 , ti ) within the cmssm scenario are largely dominated by the photon contribution and present a decoupling behaviour at large @xmath51 . in this case",
    "the present experimental bound is only reached at low @xmath51 .",
    "the perspectives for the future are much more promising .",
    "if the announced sensitivity by prism / prime of @xmath86 is finally attained , the full studied range of @xmath51 will be covered .",
    "[ fig:5 ] also illustrates that within the nuhm scenario the higgs contribution dominates at large @xmath51 for light higgs bosons .",
    "the predicted rates are close to the present experimental bound not only in the low @xmath51 region but also for heavy susy spectra . as in the previous semileptonic tau",
    "decays , we have also found a simple formula for the conversion rates , within the mass insertion approximation , which is valid at large @xmath50  @xcite and can be used for further analysis .",
    "this is dominated by the higgs @xmath34 contribution and is given by , @xmath87 it shows clearly the relevant features : the @xmath88 enhacement of the rates , the higgs mass dependence , @xmath89 , and the strange quark mass dependence , @xmath90 .",
    "+    the predictions of the @xmath25 conversion rates for several nuclei are collected in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "we can see again the growing behaviour with @xmath51 in the large @xmath51 region due to the non - decoupling of the higgs contributions . at present , the most competitive nucleus for lfv searches is au where , for the choice of input parameters in this figure , all the predicted rates are above the experimental bound .",
    "we have also shown in  @xcite that @xmath25 conversion in nuclei is extremely sensitive to @xmath14 , similarly to @xmath91 and @xmath92 and , therefore , a future measurement of this mixing angle can help in the searches of lfv in the @xmath25 sector .    in conclusion , we have shown that semileptonic tau decays nicely complement the searches for lfv in the @xmath93 sector , in addition to @xmath94 .",
    "the future prospects for @xmath25 conversion in ti are the most promising for lfv searches .",
    "both processes , semileptonic tau decays and @xmath25 conversion in nuclei are indeed more sensitive to the higgs sector than @xmath95 .",
