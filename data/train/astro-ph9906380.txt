    "the supernova remnant ic  443 is a prime example of the interaction of a supernova blast wave with an ambient molecular cloud . on optical plates ,   appears as an incomplete shell of filaments ( fig .",
    "1 ) with a total extent of about 20  arcmin , i.e. @xmath4 for an adopted distance of 1500pc .",
    "the shock generated by the supernova explosion , that occurred @xmath5 ago , encountered nearby molecular gas which is mainly found along a nw - se direction across the face of the optical shell .",
    "has been the subject of numerous studies from x - rays , visible , infrared to radio wavelengths ( e.g. , mufson et al . , 1986 and references therein ) .",
    "studies of the interaction between the shock and the ambient molecular gas were done by observing molecular hydrogen in the rotational ",
    "vibrational transitions ( burton 1988 , burton et al .",
    "1990- see fig.1 - and richter et al .",
    "1995a ) , in the pure rotational s(2 ) transition ( richter et al .",
    "1995b ) , in other simple molecules such as co and hco@xmath6 ( e.g. , van dishoeck et al .",
    "1993 and references therein ) and in atomic carbon ( keene at al .",
    "1996 ) .    in this letter we report mapping results of the pure rotational lines of h@xmath0 using the isocam cvf over the western ridge of ic  443 , a position corresponding to clump g in the nomenclature of huang et al .",
    "the observations reveal the details of the structure and the physical conditions of the shocked molecular gas in ic  443 with a pixel field of view of @xmath7 and at unprecedented sensitivity ( mjy ) .",
    "the observed h@xmath0 line fluxes are well predicted by a time - dependent shock model recently developed by chize et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and flower & pineau des forts ( 1999 ) .",
    "the observations were done in 1998 february with the isocam cvf ( cesarsky et al .",
    "a pixel size of @xmath7 was used , yielding a total field of view of @xmath8 .",
    "scans of the long - wavelength cvf were obtained : the lw - cvf2 from 13.53 to 9   and then the lw - cvf1 from 9 to 5.0   for a total of 115 wavelength steps ; the resolving power is 40 .",
    "each wavelength was observed for 12.6 sec , i.e. six readouts at 2.1 sec , for a total observing time of some 30 minutes .",
    "isocam was pointed towards @xmath9 = 06h  13 m  41.0s and @xmath10 = 22@xmath11  33  10.4  ( coordinates b1950.0 ) , a position corresponding to the center of the molecular clump g which is also a peak in the h@xmath0 emission ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the data reduction includes a new time dependent dark current correction ( biviano & sauvage , in preparation ) as well as a new correction procedure for the transients ( coulais & abergel 1999 ) .",
    "the photometric calibration was done using the calibration files applicable to the current release of the isocam off - line processing software ( v7.0 ) ; the absolute calibration is conservatively estimated to be on the order of 25% .",
    "the zodiacal background was subtracted adopting the spectrum obtained by reach et al .",
    "( 1996 ; but note that the published data were reduced again using the same algorithms and calibration files as applied to the current data ) with a scaling factor of 0.7 .",
    "the flux of the h@xmath0 lines was obtained by numerical integration under the line profile , after subtracting a linear baseline defined by several points at either side of the line profile ; the line fluxes thus obtained are independent of the assumed zodiacal background .",
    "we estimate the statistic uncertainty of the numerical integration by applying the same integration algorithm to regions of the spectrum devoid of any spectral emission ; we consistently obtain an rms noise of some 210@xmath12 .",
    "the 5 to 14   spectrum of the molecular clump g in   is dominated by the series of the pure ( @xmath13 ) rotational lines of molecular hydrogen from the s(2 ) to the s(8 ) transitions ( fig .  2 ) . in particular",
    ", there is no indication of any atomic fine structure line . at low level intensity ,",
    "the set of dust emission bands from 6.2 to 11.3   is clearly present , including the 12.7   band .",
    "note that the relative strength of the dust bands is typical of that of the ism ( boulanger 1998 ) , suggesting that a possible contribution from the [ ] line at 12.8   is negligeable .",
    "this dust emission has comparable intensities over the entire isocam field , i.e. a few mjysr@xmath14 , which is similar to the intensities measured in diffuse regions of the ophiucus cloud .",
    "an image in one of the dust bands , e.g. 7.7  @xmath15 m , does not show any structure correlated with the molecular filament . using the trend between the band intensity and the uv radiation field shown by boulanger ( 1998 )",
    ", we find that the excitation of the dust bands is commensurable with a radiation field @xmath16 .",
    "the dust bands are probably unrelated to the supernova remnant and more likely mixed with the interstellar gas along the 1.5  kpc line of sight toward .",
    "although very faint , the 7.7 and 6.2   dust bands contaminate the s(4 ) and s(6 ) h@xmath0 lines .",
    "we have fitted lorentzians to the dust bands ( boulanger et al .",
    "1998 ) and removed the resulting mean dust band spectrum from each individual cvf spectrum prior to performing the numerical integrations .",
    "figure  3 shows the total emission of the h@xmath0 lines between 5 and 13.5@xmath15 m , i.e. the sum of the s(2 ) to s(7 ) lines , together with the integrated line intensity of the s(2 ) and s(7 ) transitions ( top panels ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission is found along a ridge of about @xmath17 ( 0.25pc@xmath180.65pc ) running sw to ne , a structure which is comparable to that seen in co or hco@xmath6 ( van dishoeck et al .",
    "1993 , tauber et al .",
    "the higher spatial resolution of the isocam data clearly reveal a series of knots sitting on a plateau .",
    "the h@xmath0 knots are very bright with peak values of a few @xmath19   ( table  1 ) .",
    "the eastern side of the molecular ridge , facing the origin of the supernova explosion , appears sharper than the opposite side where weak emission is found extending westwards .",
    "altogether there are about 130 pixels that show h@xmath0 emission with intensities above the 10@xmath20 level , i.e. @xmath21   for all the six rotational transitions s(2 ) to s(7 ) .",
    "this fact allows the construction of as many h@xmath0 excitation diagrams which plot the logarithm of the column density , corrected for statistical weight , in the upper level of each h@xmath0 transition vs. the energy of that level , @xmath22 .",
    "when calculating the column densities , we corrected the observed line fluxes for extinction , using a screen model and the extinction curve from draine & lee ( 1984 ) .",
    "peaka corresponds to a position studied by moorhouse et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and richter et al .",
    "( 1995a - their position 3 ) .",
    "moorhouse et al .",
    "derived an extinction of a@xmath23 = 0.6 mag . , whereas richter et al . estimated a somewhat higher value ( @xmath24mag",
    "we adopted the former value ( see dereddening factors in table  1 ) .",
    "the middle and bottom panels in fig .  3 present the cvf spectra and the corresponding excitation diagrams of the three emission peaks labeled a , b , c. the statistical weights used in fig .",
    "3 include a factor of 3 for ortho - h@xmath0 and 1 for para - h@xmath0 .",

    "the results of a simple lte two - component h@xmath0 model are shown in fig .  3 : a ` warm ' h@xmath0 component with an excitation temperature of @xmath25 and typical column densities in between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and a ` hot ' h@xmath0 component with @xmath28 and @xmath29 a few @xmath30 ( table  1 ) .",
    "the parameters of the ` warm ' component are determined almost entirely by the intensities of the s(2 ) and s(3 ) lines and the ` hot ' component dominates the h@xmath0 transitions s(4 ) to s(7 ) . although the evidence for a ` warm ' component is very strong , the isocam data only poorly constrain its properties because of the lack of measurement of the s(1 ) and s(0 ) h@xmath0 transitions . furthermore , the uncertainty in the extinction correction ( especially for the s(3 ) line whose position coincides with the peak of the silicate 9.7  band ) introduces an additional uncertainty in the temperature determination . using different extinction laws and adopting values for a@xmath31 between 0.5 and 1mag .",
    ", we derive typical uncertainties of @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the warm and the hot components , respectively .",
    "iso spectroscopy of regions where shocks dominate the excitation has revealed that the shocked gas has a range of temperatures from a few 100k to several 1000k : cepheusa ( wright et al .",
    "1996 ) , orion ( rosenthal et al . 1999 ) and bipolar outflows ( cabrit et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 lines can not be explained by a single shock model and combinations of j- and/or c - type shocks with different velocities and pre - shock densities have been invoked to account for the observed line fluxes .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached for .",
    "based on an analysis of the [ ] 63   fine structure line and near - infrared h@xmath0 lines , burton et al .",
    "( 1990 ) concluded that the infrared line emission of   can only be modeled as a slow ( 10 - 20@xmath34 ) , partially dissociating j shock where the oxygen chemistry is suppressed , i.e. the cooling is dominated by [ ] emission and not by h@xmath0o cooling - see also richter et al .",
    "( 1995a , b ) .",
    "far - infrared spectroscopy obtained with iso on ic443 confirms these conclusions and will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .    following the interpretation of wright et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the shocked h@xmath0 gas in cepheusa , the h@xmath0 lines in   can be fit by a combination of two c - shocks from the models of kaufman & neufeld ( 1996 ) .",
    "a good match to the data towards peaka is obtained combining a first shock with a pre - shock density of @xmath35 , a velocity of @xmath36 and a covering factor @xmath37 of 0.85 with a second shock of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath37 of 0.008 ( see fig .",
    "such a steady - state model requires at least two c - shocks with a set of 3 free parameters and relatively high pre - shock densities for the high velocity component .",
    "recently , chize et al . ( 1998 ) pointed out that the intensities of the ro - vibrational h@xmath0 lines are sensitive to the temporal evolution of a shock wave . in many astrophysical situations ,",
    "shock waves are unlikely to have reached steady - state which occurs at approximately 10@xmath40yr . at times scales of a few 10@xmath41yr",
    ", the shocked gas may show both c- and j - type characteristics : within the c - shock , a j - type shock is established heating a small fraction of the gas to high temperatures ( flower & pineau des forts 1999 ) . in the case of , the typical size of the molecular clump g is @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 , but some of the molecular clumps have typical sizes of about a few arcsecs ( richter et al",
    ". 1995a ) . for a shock velocity of @xmath44 ,",
    "the crossing time of the shock wave is thus @xmath45 indicating that the shock wave in clump g is not in steady - state .",
    "figure  4 shows the predictions of the time - dependent shock model for an observation along the direction of the shock propagation .",
    "the model results are given for four evolutionary times with the following parameters : pre - shock gas density @xmath46 , shock velocity @xmath47 , magnetic field strength @xmath48 and ortho - to - para ratio of 3 .",
    "the filling factor in this model is equal to 1 .",
    "a smaller filling factor could be compensated by a larger line of sight path across the shocked h@xmath0 gas for a non face - on shock .",
    "the post - shock densities are @xmath49 comparable with the values derived by van dishoeck et al .",
    "the agreement between the model predictions and the observations is best for intermediate times , i.e. @xmath502000yr . at earlier epochs when the j - shock dominates , the low excitation h@xmath0 lines are too weak . and after 5000yr , when the c - shock steady - state is reached , the higher excitation h@xmath0 lines ( above 10@xmath40k ) are much too weak . in between , the intensities of the h@xmath0 rotational lines",
    "are predicted within factors of 2 and the coexistence of the ` hot ' and ` warm ' h@xmath0 components is well explained within a single model .",
    "models with other parameters ( e.g. , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) provide less good fits .",
    "the best fits are obtained for early evolutionary times ( @xmath531000 - 2000years ) and densities of @xmath54 with shock velocities @xmath55 .",
    "higher shock velocities will predict too large intensities for the high - excitation h@xmath0 lines .",
    "the agreement between these time - dependent model predictions and the data of  is very encouraging in view of some of the simplistic underlying assumptions . in particular , the assumed geometry ( plane parallel )",
    "is oversimplified and does not describe the molecular filament which is seen edge - on and consists of numerous small clumps .",
    "clearly a more thorough study should be done to explore the entire parameter space of the model and compare the predictions with additional data available on .    in the model , the s(2 ) to s(7 ) lines account for about 70% of the luminosity in all the h@xmath0 lines . at peak",
    "a , the measured s(2 ) to s(7 ) flux is @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) and , according to the model , the h@xmath0 lines alone would thus carry @xmath58",
    ". towards clump g , the s(3 ) and s(2 ) h@xmath0 lines account for almost the entire iras 12-band emission .",
    "the mean value of these lines in that band is 5.4@xmath59 comparable to the iras peak value , i.e. 6@xmath60 ( e.g. , oliva et al . 1999 ) .",
    "similarly , the iras 25 -band could also be due to h@xmath0 line emission .",
    "the model predictions ( fig .",
    "4 ) for the s(0 ) and s(1 ) line fluxes ( at an evolutionary time of 2000 years ) are 1.2@xmath61 and 7.7@xmath62 , respectively . taking into account the 20% transmission at 17.03  of the iras 25  band , the strong s(1 ) line would thus contribute @xmath63 at 25 , which is comparable to the measured 25  iras flux at peaka ( @xmath64 , e.g. oliva et al .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the excitation of the gas in   is entirely collisional",
    ".    finally , oliva et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found towards the optical filaments of  , which trace the low density atomic gas , that most of the 12 and 25   iras fluxes is accounted for by ionized line emission ( mainly [ ] and [ ] ) .",
    "our results show that this conclusion can not be generalised towards the molecular hydrogen ring ( fig .",
    "1 ) where the dense molecular gas essentially cools via the h@xmath0 lines in the near- and mid - infrared and via the [ ] emission line in the far - infrared .",
